AdvancedFitness,3e3ysz,The_Pert_Whisperer,6,Tue Jul 21 22:59:45 2015 UTC,"Your Muscle and Strength article references the BS/AA lit reviews, saying the following in their conclusion sections:   In 2013, Alan Aragon and Brad Schoenfeld published a research study which also stated the benefits of making sure training individuals eat some protein around their training session in order to get optimal results.  They stated, “Due to the transient anabolic impact of a protein-rich meal and its potential synergy with the trained state, pre- and post-exercise meals should not be separated by more than approximately 3–4 hours”.   and   In 2012, researchers looked through a large volume of past studies to find that higher protein intakes resulted in better muscle gains.  The studies which demonstrated no significant increases in muscle gains were due to low total protein intakes (compared to standard intakes within the bodybuilding community) or the difference between groups (i.e. high and low protein test groups) was very small to begin with.   They wrap up the protein timing bit by saying exactly what BS/AA say:   Have one feeding close to your training session to enhance recovery.   from the study:   The results of this meta-analysis indicate that if a peri-workout anabolic window of opportunity does in fact exist, the window for protein consumption would appear to be greater than one-hour before and after a resistance training session. Any positive effects noted in timing studies were found to be due to an increased protein intake rather than the temporal aspects of consumption, but a lack of matched studies makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions in this regard."

AdvancedFitness,3e3ysz,barcelonatimes,3,Wed Jul 22 00:59:47 2015 UTC,"It seems that part of the problem is the precise definition of ""nutrient timing"" being used. Much of Schoenfeld's work is focused specifically on peri-workout timing and the idea of anabolic window. The other studies you are citing aren't really looking at timing relative to a workout, but timing/protein distribution over the course of a day.   Based these studies and other literature I've seen, there is some benefit to equally spacing nutrient consumption. However, the effect is probably not huge (as u/Mogwoggle points out one study found an 8% difference). The other thing I wonder is a lot of these studies are done with relatively low amounts of protein (<0.5g/lb), whereas a lot of us consume 1g/lb or more. I wonder if the protein surplus was increased that much if the nutrient timing effect would completely dissipate."

AdvancedFitness,3dx4js,GuidedByMonkeys,16,Mon Jul 20 07:24:03 2015 UTC,My only problem with doing any rep as fast as possible is breaking form.

AdvancedFitness,3dx4js,Audica,14,Mon Jul 20 10:02:12 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the answer is reducing the weight.  I know that no one who's even looked at a weight room wants to do that, but if I'm understanding the study's outcome, then, in the long run, it would increase strength."
AdvancedFitness,3dx4js,the_VanillaGorilla,6,Mon Jul 20 15:59:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of the detriment to slow speed training is you fatigue quicker and cannot do the same weight or volume as a controlled or high speed lift. Using bar speed as a training and coaching technique has many proven benefits over slow lifts in regards to power and raw strength. Hypertrophy is being studied, but to my knowledge has few overall valid studies to make a confirmation either way.  Physiologically there is much more that goes into it but for a quick layman's understanding that is the most basic reasoning.  As far as the technique concern, you're definitely correct. Unless you're maxing, technique should be a priority over speed. That also has a range of value though. For example, a clean with bad technique can be a lot more harmful than a bench with bad technique. Larger range of motion and overall muscle/joint movement and recruitment.  I am currently developing a new program using bar speed as an assessment of volume and intensity within a workout to prepare an athlete for the American open (Olympic weightlifting ) Will probably throw something up about it when I have progress.  Tl:Dr fast is better than slow for strength and power. Studies looking into hypertrophy are unconfirmed. Use good technique.

AdvancedFitness,3dx4js,Laksm,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:15:53 2015 UTC,"To me that seems like a good thing. If you break form too badly under speed work, you will also break form with near maximal load. So speed work is in my opinion a really good way to develop your form"
AdvancedFitness,3dx4js,Pejorativez,11,Mon Jul 20 11:17:48 2015 UTC,"So speed work is in my opinion a really good way to develop your form   That's not how muscle memory works. If you bounce the bar off of your chest during speed reps then the CNS will remember that movement during regular TUT lifts. If anything, slow controlled reps help you learn the correct movement. It's the same for any sport, such as swimming or soccer (you start slow then gradually increase speed). I'm not saying speed work is useless, only that it is an accessory technique to a form that is already at a high level"
AdvancedFitness,3dx4js,Laksm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:39:27 2015 UTC,"I agree that if you can't perform controlled reps with proper form, you shouldn't be doing speed work.

Speed work have helped me maintain form with a much higher load, and consequently my 1rm have gone way up."
AdvancedFitness,3dx4js,Pejorativez,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:32:17 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen any program that tells you to use higher loads than normal while doing speed work. In fact they tell you the opposite. If speed allows you to lift heavier weights than you normally would, then you're probably experiencing the effects of momentum (dropping the bar and bouncing it on the chest, bounce up from the squat hole, etc.) and it is called cheating. Maybe I'm wrong but what you're writing here runs contrary to everything I've seen online about programming and speed work (the last thing you want to do while 1rmaxing is use high speed)."
AdvancedFitness,3dx4js,eaglessoar,12,Mon Jul 20 15:36:29 2015 UTC,"I could see a potential flaw in this study. They were using bar speed as a metric for how much they should lift each day, and then having the MaxV lift at that .55m/s while the HalfV lifted at half that. Then the next day they would come in, warm up until they hit .55m/s and then use that weight.  But the MaxV people are training to lift faster so obviously when it comes time to set your working weight for the day they are going to get to a higher weight than the HalfV group. Then since they are using a higher weight they will make more gains.  I wonder if they asked the HalfV people whether they felt like they could have lifted more weight. It seems like if I can bench 175 at .55m/s but then you make me train at .27m/s for a set amount of reps, I'm not going to be fully exahusted. It just comes back to the force equation at the beginning, I'm over here benching 175lbs 3x6 at .27m/s and MaxV is benching 175lbs 3x6 at .55m/s. Therefore in their workout they are being forced to generate more force and will have better gains.  An interesting question would be, let the HalfV group up the weight or reps (or have one group up weight and one up reps) to the point where they are exhausted lifting at half speed. So then it becomes, is it better to lift 3x6 175lbs at .55m/s or 3x6 200lbs at .27m/s or  3x12 175lbs at .27m/s which is a legitimate dilemma to have. Should I lift something near my max but lift it slowly or should I lift something I can get good barspeed with, or should I lift slowly but double my volume?  This test seems like the artificially held back the HalfV group. If I can move 175lbs at .55m/s but you make me train at .27m/s of course I'm not going to make the same gains, you're forcing me to slow down.  Thoughts?"

All said though, with equal technique, more strength = more power so if the question is how do I hit the ball harder - focus first on technique (via coaching) and continue to build strength to supplement.  To more directly answer your question, lets say you work out all day doing hammer curls and shoulder exercises and everything you can to make your arms super strong. You also work on the explosiveness aspects too, not just raw strength. The 'problem' is a huge component of racket-head speed is keeping a slightly loose risk and just before ball contact snapping through and tightening. That timing, trajectory through the ball, etc, has nothing to do with raw strength and everything to do with technique."

AdvancedFitness,3dm3wi,e_n_t_r_0_p_y,0,Sun Jul 19 09:52:58 2015 UTC,This is the answer
AdvancedFitness,3dm3wi,JSCMI,5,Sun Jul 19 13:12:33 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: Pure speculation on my part, but for the sake of discussion...  Your 3/2 rep sets serve to de-sensitize the lifter to the weight. Kind of like if you do 3-5 sets across at a weight the 2nd set can feel significantly easier than the 1st. In this context, de-sensitizing lets you heavy single be heavier.   In addition to the above, the lighter sets between heavy singles allow recuperation for maximal stress/output again without any cool down.   Unlike other active recovery, they have the benefit of adding more workout volume.   Thus you accumulate volume, de-sensitize for your heaviest work, and do not have to exert maximal effort within a short span of time (consecutive sets)."

Your article seems to address those factirs, but also includes changing up exercises, which seems to be what others are objecting to -- see above comment re P90X and Insanity.    As to studies which would argue against too-frequent changes in exercises, there is the Moritani  and Devries study that found the first few weeks of training, the gains are mostly neural as opposed to structural.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/453338"

Should be pretty challenging Week 4: start over 5-10lbs heavier Then just keep that rolling until they miss reps two weeks in a row, and sub out exercises.  Usually after 4-5 cycles (12-15 weeks).  So if they're doing two different accessory lifts for the same muscle, they're usually getting a new one cycled in every 6-7 weeks or so.  Option 2: Week 1: 3x8-12 Week 2: 4x8-12 Week 3: 5x8-12 Week 4: 3x8-12, heavier Then just keep that rolling until they miss reps two weeks in a row, and sub out exercises.

In all honesty, I wouldn't be surprised if there are some positive aspects, because if you do the same workouts again and again, your body will adapt well to those movements, but inevitably there are some muscles not being worked as hard as they could be. In theory, muscle confusion, or whatever the correct term is, would seem to provide a way to activate a larger breadth of muscles and by changing angles and movement patterns, you'll inevitably be changing the EMG activations of the muscles as well.

Two other things - 1: concentric abdominal contraction will do more lumbar flexion than thoracic. 2: if you kept the whole spine in neutral throughout a sit up, then you will be working the abs isometrically while using the hip flexors concentrically and eccentrically, as you will be moving at the hip joint, not the spine (so hip flexors will work harder than the abs!)"

I would wager that this makes it less effective for hypertrophy. It also probably will reduce the shortening of the RA, so that means better posture and less need for stretching. Some would say limiting spinal motion is desirable to reduce wear on the spinal discs. Others would say spinal motion hydrates and brings nutrients to the discs and actually makes them healthier."

AdvancedFitness,3dh91c,rhysgx94,4,Thu Jul 16 06:49:18 2015 UTC,"In theory, yes. But realistically no due to different factors of how your body works.   It depends on how well you can mobilise fat first of all, there's no guarantee you can hit that target for energy use that you need. Whereas consuming the extra calories will almost certain help with your goal.   Second of all fat oxidation doesn't contribute to insulin response for protein synthesis the same way consuming food for an insulin spike does.   Thirdly fat oxidation is very poor at providing quick release energy which is the type you need for the type of exercise that gaining muscle involves, ie anaerobic resistance training.   So utilising your fat will be a slow burner and not guaranteed the same rate of energy release for what you need to achieve. It doesn't work that way."
AdvancedFitness,3dh91c,bardolift,2,Thu Jul 16 11:28:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response man.   Second of all fat oxidation doesn't contribute to insulin response for protein synthesis the same way consuming food for an insulin spike does.   I hadn't thought of the insulin spikes, but I did assume it wouldn't* be as efficient. However, in counter to that, it has been shown that as long as your insulin is within physiological range, there isn't a huge difference in the anabolic response.   Thirdly fat oxidation is very poor at providing quick release energy which is the type you need for the type of exercise that gaining muscle involves, ie anaerobic resistance training.   Well, as long as you're eating enough around the workout, you'd have sufficient energy, yes?  Edit: would -> wouldn't"
AdvancedFitness,3dh91c,bardolift,2,Thu Jul 16 11:32:44 2015 UTC,"No bother, I did my thesis on ketogenic diets and endurance athlete performance so I like this stuff!  Yeah I think you're right about the anabolic response, I'm a bit behind on the readings but I do believe there is still solid evidence concerning the molecular pathways for muscle growth involving insulin release. Not sure   Yes, you would have sufficient energy if you ate around your workout however you have to keep your idea of fat usage as energy in mind. If you ingest calories, your body will stop its fat oxidation in order to break down the glucose first as it is easier to do for energy. So if that's the case, you're kinda preventing your body from getting the energy from fat.   Long story short fat doesn't provide the right type of energy for your training for muscle again alongside the nutrients needed for muscle growth."
AdvancedFitness,3dh91c,JSCMI,2,Thu Jul 16 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"The main problem is that without the surplus you lose out on the anabolic effect of ingesting food.   What I'd be more interested in is a comparison of groups, matched for RMR, which consume different amounts but the group(s) that consume(s) more engages in more LISS or HIIT or something to attempt to match rate of mass gain.   Would it be possible to get the increased rate of muscle gain with the additional food, but without additional mass gain as compared to a (roughly) maintenance intake. The difference presumably coming out of fat stores.   LISS lately seems like the '80s-'90s back and forth debates about whether ""eggs are good or bad for you"" (to admittedly simplify it). Were decades of athletes who trained strength and used training like jogging or speedrope to ""stay lean"" (and condition) majoring in the minors?

Your question is a complicated one that is most certainly controversial as there are many ways to improve your squat strength. Increasing the variables you listed can certainly be successful for many. Just like not everyone squats the same, not everyone adapts the same.   As far as decreasing injury (and probably improving strength as well), in addition to knowing your activity besides working out to me it really depends on your baseline function related to strength, range of motion (active and passive), muscle tightness, passive accessory motion (glide that occurs between bones with movement), and other variables I most certainly missed. Depending on impairments depend on what should possibly be improved. As far as injury prevention, to me one of the coolest things currently being looked at is the FMS (functional movement screen). It's 7 basic tests that have collectively been used to screen individuals for an increased risk of injury as an active person. Below is a really cool study looking at an anonymous NFL team and how there performance on the test before the season linked to injuries during.

This suggests that the solution to getting stronger and safer isn't just ""lift more""  From the last study:   Fundamental movement patterns such as those assessed by the FMS™ can be easily tested clinically. This retrospective descriptive study demonstrated that professional football players with a lower composite score (< 14) on the FMS™ had a greater chance of suffering a serious injury over the course of one season.

AdvancedFitness,3dd529,brittanymc,2,Wed Jul 15 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"Most if not all of the hip muscles are highly active during deadlifts and squats, even the ones that you'd think don't play a role in sagittal plane movements. However, I don't think there'd be a downside to working them in other planes beside more time spent in the gym.   With shoulders, I think a lot of typical gym rats would see a benefit to directly working some less common movements more, such as external rotation and scaption. Scaption is going to have a greater focus on supraspnatus and lower traps (assuming you go above your head) than normal lateral raises, which are two muscles that could likely use more focus in most people."
AdvancedFitness,3dd529,ruffolous,2,Wed Jul 15 11:03:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer. You're exactly right when talking about external shoulder rotation because that movement pattern is not found in most programs (compound pulling movements such as rows don't lead to external rotation). My exercise physio actually explained to me that the reason so many people have shoulder pains and injuries from BB BP is because there is a strength mismatch between the front and backside of the shoulder joint, meaning the shoulders are constantly internally rotated for most gym goers who are front-delt and pec dominant. This leads to rotator cuff weakness & potential injury.   Now what about more ""popular"" muscles such as the triceps?  Mark Rippetoe explains how most people aren't utilizing every function of the triceps by simple pulldowns (after 01:20). This critique includes the BP in my opinion.

AdvancedFitness,3dazcr,UrbDurb,6,Tue Jul 14 21:39:32 2015 UTC,"L-Tyrosine (about 1.25g worth) in my pre workout wouldn't offset my body's natural dopamine production   Some background that will help us out:   Do you take your preworkout mix with a meal? With any type of food or drink? (e.g. milk or especially anything with protein) Are there any other amino acids in the preworkout mix? What else does it contain?   Assuming no co-ingestion with protein and no other amino acids in the preworkout mix, here are my thoughts:   Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the creation of dopamine (it converts tyrosine --> DOPA). The reason L-DOPA is used as an anti-Parkinsonian agent over L-tyrosine is because L-DOPA has bypassed the rate-limiting step. Whether 1.25 g of tyrosine is going to be enough to overcome this, I have no idea. Aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), which catalyzes the conversion of L-DOPA into dopamine (and histidine into histamine, and phenylalnine, tyrosine, and tryptophan into their respective trace amines), is widely distributed throughout the human body outside of the brain, including in the digestive system, the blood, and the kidneys. Given its widespread distribution and plethora of substrates, I figure that any excess tyrosine will compete with histidine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine for conversion. No idea what percentage of isolated oral tyrosine reaches the brain, but I'm doubtful it's significant. Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), which catalyzes the metabolism of the catecholamines and their metabolites (most importantly, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine), is widely distributed throughout the periphery; in fact, most regions of the brain utilize monoamine oxidase (MAO) for the breakdown of catecholamines over COMT (though there are some exceptions). The liver is actually where the majority of the body's COMT is expressed. Any L-DOPA, and even less, the catecholamines, are most likely going to be broken down into inactive metabolites before even reaching the brain. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) catalyzes the metabolism of the catecholamines and other monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin, but not histamine to any significant extent). MAO-A mainly breaks down serotonin and related trace amines, and is expressed primarily in the gut. However, it also metabolizes dopamine and nor/epinephrine (though moreso dopamine, it has about equal affinity for each MAO isoform (A and B). MAO-B isn't expressed as much in the gut, it is found moreso in platelets and the kidneys, but also the brain.   This isn't ignoring that dopamine and nor/epinephrine have peripheral effects too - they very much do. I'm doubtful any effects on central dopamine production will be significant when taken in isolation, and even less so if taken with protein-containing food or drink. Peripheral catecholamine production may be affected more so, but I'm still doubtful the effects will be significant, especially in terms of depression (feedback effects on the HPA axis), though they could be.  What is your reason behind adding L-tyrosine? What are your goals?"
AdvancedFitness,3dazcr,SlimSlamtheFlimFlam,3,Wed Jul 15 02:37:53 2015 UTC,"I sometimes take up to 8 grams of L-Tyrosine as a preworkout or after a day out in the sun (it's a precursor to melanin) and I've never noticed any harmful effects.  Here's a quick excerpt from Examine:  ""Supplemental L-Tyrosine is converted into L-DOPA and then into active catecholamines (adrenaline/epinephdrine, noradrenaline/norepinephrine, and dopamine). L-Tyrosine forms a pool of substrate that this group of catecholamine neurotransmitters can get substrate from when their production is needed.""  The rate limiting step for this conversion is the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase.  You should be fine, it seems the body only takes the amount it needs."

AdvancedFitness,3d2w3a,halodoze,2,Mon Jul 13 14:49:06 2015 UTC,"Here is a good part. It shows the synergistic effect of aloe Vera and test.  Referring to Table 3, it can be seen that whole leaf Aloe vera administered to immature castrate mice, in combination with, testosterone propionate over a 4 day period significantly increased the effect of testosterone propionate on seminal vesicle weight. The dosage of testosterone propionate administered (25 μg) was determined from the dose response curve prepared using the castrate rats. Immature castrate mice, rather than rats, were used because mice are known to be somewhat more sensitive to Aloe vera and possibly to testosterone propionate. As can be seen in Table 3, the average weight of the seminal vesicle of mice receiving saline (control), corn oil (control) and Aloe vera (control) was 6.7 mg, 7.9 mg and 7.2 mg, respectively. The weight of the seminal vesicle was increased to an average of 20.9 mg by administration of testosterone propionate (25 μg) alone. This represents a 312±12% (A) increase in weight over the corn oil controls. When testosterone propionate (25 μg) was administered in combination with Aloe vera at a dosage of 150 mg/kg, the average weight of the seminal vesicle increased to 30.7 mg, a 461.0±28.5% (C) increase in weight over the corn oil controls. Aloe vera, alone, given at 150 mg/kg per day for 4 days gave an 8.1±0.9% (B) increase in seminal vesicle weight over the corn oil controls. Thus, the combined treatment with Aloe vera and testosterone propionate (C) has a greater effect on seminal vesicle weight than the additive effect of testosterone propionate (A) and Aloe vera (B) administered separately. In other words, A+B<C. Therefore, Aloe vera which has little androgenic activity has a synergistic relationship with testosterone propionate (Table 3)."

Regardless of insulin response, calories from a mix of foods (especially fats and proteins, in most cases) will keep you feeling fuller and for a longer time than the same amount of calories from pure sugar. This can prevent over eating. Glycogen is often quickly depleted at the onset of diets. If someone begins an exercise routine, lowers their overall calories and lowers their carbohydrate intake especially, they'll tend to lose a lot of weight in the form of water that was previously bound up in sugars in the muscles in the form of glycogen. Not all of it by any means, but this is usually the steep initial drop off in weight you see with most diets. Following a diet can make people more disciplined in general. I think if you take most any fad diet that isn't completely wacky, if someone commits to following it then just the accountability of sticking to that diet instead of the nebulous goal of ""eating healthy"" can motivate people to actually eat less."

AdvancedFitness,3d0gmi,tsunami_sunaynay,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"Free sugar is the issue that gets confused often here. There is no data to suggest sugars in fruits, milk, and unprocessed foods cause huge insulin surges or are bad for weight loss because they are trapped in fiber and our body releases them over time. Therefore, no ""spikes"". FREE sugars added into processed foods like cookies, or even a flavored yogurt, can do that. But, even worse is that sugar is an addictive substance. You're right in talking about willpower, but an addiction is an addiction. You wouldn't tell an alcoholic to limit to a shot a day and use willpower, would you? I guess some people would, and can and do. Further, in my opinion calories are not created equal, because when a free sugar calorie causes an insulin spike, it is stored if your blood sugar is too high (generally above 100). That doesn't mean if you only ate 1500 sugar calories you wouldn't lose weight. What it means is the energy is already put away, and you're hungry again. So you'd just be making yourself more miserable by having to wait between sugary snacks to get to the next one -- which only makes one obsess over one's addiction more. I use the WHO guidelines for free sugar, and limit my daily intake to 25g daily, which is 6 tablespoons of sugar a day. The average American consumes 41g, so I'd say we're all addicted and could therefore use the blanket statement line to cut it out if you can. But yeah, a sugar calorie isn't going to make you fatter than an extra protein calorie. The difference, is the protein makes you full longer, so you don't rush back to the kitchen. This isn't to start an argument, but just to say while I agree with the OP about the science--which they have correct 100%, the practical application is largely unrealistic."

I only ever had an issue with sugar when I ate a low carb diet, that made me need sugar for extra energy, nowadays, I have no issue with it, I actually don't enjoy the taste of sugary foods, but maybe I'm an exception to the vast majority (which is the population we're referring to).

As in, is this only a concern if you are consuming something like 5g/kg/day of fructose?

AdvancedFitness,3d0gmi,SlimSlamtheFlimFlam,3,Mon Jul 13 00:58:31 2015 UTC,"I had thought that excess fructose is first converted into uric acid, rather than palmitic acid?   It's not that fructose is converted into uric acid, it's that the conversion of fructose --> fructose 6-phosphate requires ATP (which then becomes ADP). The use of that phosphate group means there's less phosphate available for ATP generation, promoting degradation of ADP --> AMP --> adenosine to salvage phosphate groups. Adenosine --> inosine --> hypoxanthine --> xanthine --> uric acid. As a result, more uric acid is produced and released into the blood. But then, as the amount of available adenosine decreases, purine synthesis increases. If there's still a relative lack of phosphate for ATP generation, it of course gets metabolized into uric acid. (On the other hand, a relative lack of phosphate is also the reason behind hyperuricemia from starvation or longer-term fasting).  In the context of a hypercaloric diet (assuming the majority of the extra calories are coming from sugary sources) , its ability to reduce insulin sensitivity becomes more relevant, which indirectly promotes increased uric acid production. Hypercaloric dieting in itself promotes reduced insulin sensitivity, as well.   palmitic acid   Palmitic acid is the fatty acid produced during fatty acid synthesis, regardless of source. So yes, excess fructose, along with other monosaccharides, and to a lesser extent, certain amino acids, will lead to increased palmitic acid synthesis. Not all of the palmitic acid formed remains as palmitic acid, it can be further metabolized into other fatty acids (such as longer-chain saturated fatty acids, or some cis-MUFAs (if desaturation occurs at carbon 9 or before)), but particularly in conditions of excess, palmitic acid will be the main product.  Normally, this process is tightly controlled via allosteric regulation (inhibition of enzymes earlier in the process as a sign of 'hey! we have enough!'), but in the context of excess nutrient availability, it may be overwhelmed.   is there an intake at which the above becomes a factor? As in, is this only a concern if you are consuming something like 5g/kg/day of fructose?   I wouldn't worry, assuming you're not overeating consistently and that you don't overly-favor certain food groups more than others (e.g. fruitarian diet)."

I have a Polar H7 and Nexus 5, know any good android apps that would measure calories burned by heart rate?"
AdvancedFitness,3czj3j,rdavis4559,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:15:11 2015 UTC,"FYI - I used a garmin forerunner 110 for roughly 1.5 years and then got the itch for a fancier watch.  I tried the polar ft80 and it seemed to consistently record caloric expenditures ~40% greater than the forerunner 110.  I then ordered a forerunner 220 and saw the reading go back to the baseline of the 110.  I even wore both the 220 and the FT80 simultaneosusly for a month to be sure.  Even if I had not done the comparison I could have said in high confidence that Polar was grossly overestimating.  Anyway, I use my 220 and the intent behind using any watch is not to measure energy expenditure but to time my training sessions and to have an accurate historical perspective of heart rate data.  What I have been doing for years with respect to energy expenditure is using the average multiplier for energy expended per minute of activity, typically shown on various websites as something like ""Strength Training, Vigorous.""  Then I slightly reduce the multiplier by ~10% just to have a buffer because I'd prefer underestimating than overestimating.  Finally, I'll use the multiplier against my active minutes versus total training time.  I realize this isn't the most accurate method and that it does not take into account energy requirements for muscle synthesis but it is close enough for me."
AdvancedFitness,3czj3j,rdavis4559,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:30:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah doing something like that is definitely practical.  Even simpler for calories is to just track caloric intake, keep a stable workout schedule, and weigh in frequently for a good average.  That can get a pretty good TDEE estimate.  The hopes of a calculator is somewhat academic with some real life application."

AdvancedFitness,3cxk42,alecco,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:19:55 2015 UTC,tl;dr   Intermittent fasting (alternate-day fasting) resulted in beneficial effects that met or exceeded those of caloric restriction including reduced serum glucose and insulin levels and increased resistance of neurons in the brain to excitotoxic stress. Intermittent fasting therefore has beneficial effects on glucose regulation and neuronal resistance to injury in these mice that are independent of caloric intake.
AdvancedFitness,3cxk42,Ballaticianaire,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:00:52 2015 UTC,"As others said, IF will do nothing to curb actual fat gain in a surplus, that's just contingent on the energy intake/expenditure. What IF may do is help mitigate over eating and maintaining calories each day, and maintain a healthier metabolic system (higher insulin sensitivity, less hepatic fat stores, lower LDL/higher HDL etc). I've never used IF diligently whilst bulking, gained a bunch of fat, and then subsequently got blood work done to assess markers and compare that to a non-IF bulk.   There is good evidence to think the latter situation would occur though, at least from a few studies (but as you said, mostly rodent). There was one study I remember as well where they had two groups on a surplus and the one eating more meals per day gained more hepatic fat stores. This makes sense mechanistically too via chronically heightened mTOR and so on. Just a little surmise. But I am a big fan of IF and its implications. Hopefully we get some more concrete human data soon."
AdvancedFitness,3cxk42,Insamity,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:05:24 2015 UTC,I would say that it does ameliorate the metabolic effects of overeating. I think this is mainly from calorie partitioning. It seems like when I am fasting and I overeat that the fat is portioned out more equally through my body instead of viscerally like before. There may also be slightly more muscle gain and less fat gain but I haven't been tracking my diet closely enough to say for sure.
AdvancedFitness,3cxk42,DeathByTeaCup,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:21:20 2015 UTC,"I've been doing IF for 4 years now, except for a small period which I intentionally stopped doing it to bulk because it was getting very difficult fitting all my calories within an 8 hr window.   If you do gain less adipose tissue while intermittent fasting (or if it seems like it), I think it's more because it becomes harder eating at such a massive caloric surplus, causing you to eat less end up gaining weight (and fat) slower, giving you the illusion that you're gaining less adipose tissue."

AdvancedFitness,3d02bf,dustofoblivion123,3,Sun Jul 12 09:59:49 2015 UTC,"It is a shame they couldn't parse out dairy effects from protein effects. Still good though.  Good points:  High protein weight loss makes subjects more likely to not gain weight back.  Higher protein (about 1.5 g·kg−1·d−1), moderate carbohydrate (about 40% of total energy intake) diets appear to stabilize blood glucose by providing BCAA that upregulate recycling of glucose carbon through the glucose–alanine cycle and amino acids that serve as the primary fuel for the liver and carbon source for hepatic gluconeogenesis  Cross-sectional studies have also indicated that dairy consumption is inversely related to the incidence of impaired fasting glycemia and type 2 diabetes. (It implies it may be that dairy improves insulin sensitivity)  There is no evidence, however, that renal function in healthy individuals is diminished by consuming higher protein diets.  Their conclusion.  American and international protein requirements are, by definition, the established level of protein required to achieve nitrogen balance and prevent protein deficiencies. However, increasing dietary protein intake, which appears to be safe, can elicit several favorable metabolic adaptations, including improved weight management (such as fat loss, lean body mass retention, and body weight sustainment), glycemic regulation, calcium retention, and long-term bone health. Emerging evidence also suggests that consuming dairy, as a critical component of a high-protein diet, may potentiate the metabolic advantages of higher protein diets, primarily due to the digestive and absorptive properties and EAA content of dairy proteins.  Worth noting... All of the listed contrarian information was found to have 'no difference'. In other words, there were no opposite findings. Just studies that failed to find anything."
AdvancedFitness,3cv4y3,dustofoblivion123,9,Sat Jul 11 01:00:30 2015 UTC,"I'm a little grumpy with this study. Mostly because the title is a little misleading.

The 13-wk change in appendicular muscle mass, however, was different in the intervention and control groups [+0.4 ± 1.2 kg and −0.5 ± 2.1 kg, respectively; β = 0.95 kg (95% CI: 0.09, 1.81); P = 0.03].

But not nescesarily because youre training this seperate energy system called power."
AdvancedFitness,3caxv7,Oxyg3n,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:51:51 2015 UTC,"It's probably not a technically correct term.  You should always try to accelerate the bar as fast as possible (as long as you can control it's path) so you are always training for power (as in rate of force development). Whether an actual higher bar speed due to lower resistance is going to benefit your rate of force development is probably not researched well.   I should look into that but I sadly don't have much spare time at the moment.  btw. Rip doesn't say you can't train explosiveness (that would be silly, people do get more explosive with training). Just that it's not as trainable as max strength or endurance which I agree with. You can certainly improve someones vertical jump when untrained by quite a bit but some people are naturally more explosive than others and you aren't going to see huge increases like you can with max strength or endurance."

AdvancedFitness,3c30g3,Strikerrjones,2,Sat Jul 4 10:41:20 2015 UTC,You have a very jacked up understanding of muscle fibers. Look up Henneman's size principle and do some research on your own.

However, if you a bit of searching on how to peak for your sport/competition, you should have no issue finding something. If you'd like I have some resources on peaking for a Powerlifting meet, which may or may not have relevance."
AdvancedFitness,3bwi50,everythingisthrown,6,Thu Jul 2 20:00:51 2015 UTC,"I think that's best.  Since powerlifting is much more of a peak strength/power on a few, very taxing, albeit, short exertions, and BJJ is a longer activity, there might be slightly different optimal competition preps.   I would be careful not to be completely inactive in the days preceding the meet. I would start tapering down and finish with half weight and limited sets a day or two before your meet. Sleep and food are also big parts of your prep."
AdvancedFitness,3bwi50,IntoTheWest,4,Thu Jul 2 21:26:13 2015 UTC,"Well, there are different ways to peak which depend not only on your routine, but also strength level. You can check out powerliftingtowin.com and his analysis on routines (including their peaking)."

AdvancedFitness,3bwi50,everythingisthrown,5,Thu Jul 2 22:40:57 2015 UTC,"It's mostly trial and error, but the idea is do mostly the same exercise with less volume in order to keep CNS mostly intact but not tire out your muscles."
AdvancedFitness,3bwi50,glatts,4,Thu Jul 2 23:08:44 2015 UTC,What you're looking for is called tapering. Do a search for tapering and your sport (BJJ) and you should get some decent articles. There is no hard and fast rule that can be applied to everyone though because everybody is different. Proper tapering has helped me in powerlifting meets and football combine events. My goal was to always PR in the event and if I tapered correctly I always did.
AdvancedFitness,3bwi50,MHath,3,Fri Jul 3 13:07:01 2015 UTC,"I can tell you what I do with the sprinters I coach. The taper up to your most important meet is usually a 2 week process. Generally what you're doing is decreasing volume, not decreasing intensity. If your wednesday workout before the taper started was 3x300 meters hard with 15 minute recovery, then the first week of the taper might be 2x300 meters at the same pace and recovery. Then the last week of the taper could be 2x200 meters. A lot of the volume decrease comes from mostly eliminating aerobic workouts, so your legs feel more fresh. We still do 100% effort short sprints, like 40 meters about 4 days before the meet. Interval workout described above 3 days before. Just about nothing 2 days before. The say before would be a few 15-25 meter sprints to stimulate the central nervous system. We're still lifting during this time, but 3 sets of 4 becomes 2 sets of 3, then 1 set of 2-3. The weight doesn't increase or decrease during that time. You're just trying to maintain the strength you have built up to that point."
AdvancedFitness,3bwi50,NORMAL_LOOKING_VAGIN,2,Thu Jul 2 22:22:46 2015 UTC,"For middle distance we have one or two workouts that are faster than we've done that whole year at the beginning of our taper. Maybe 6x150 at full speed instead of 12x200 slightly above race pace. In the few days before the race we're tapering for we just jog 20-30 minutes, super light, then do drills, strides, and stretch."
AdvancedFitness,3bwi50,blaizenoble,3,Thu Jul 2 23:15:01 2015 UTC,"Cardio vascular system can take upto a week to recover from strenuous exercise. Muscles anywhere from 48-72. This varies depending on rest,  diet,  stress and all of  that.  Generally you want to taper off from exercise about week before, otherwise you run the risk of being over trained amd subsequently performing poorly."
AdvancedFitness,3bwi50,williamofgellone,2,Thu Jul 2 23:01:52 2015 UTC,"It kind of depends upon your training style.  If you're actually overreaching in training, building to a peak near a planned competitive event such that you both a) need extra recovery and b) will actually get supercompensation, then a good guideline is probably a week of tapered volume/intensity followed by a rest week immediately prior to the event, so that you're chomping at the bit, so to speak.  If your training isn't that intense, or if you're still very much a beginner-to-intermediate trainee and/or are pretty young, or if you're using the meet as a quality training session during a build-up to a bigger meet later, then maybe just a few days off before the meet.    Training AMAP right up to the competition is a bad idea if you actually care about the competition result."

AdvancedFitness,3bwi50,RawMuscleLab,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:59:57 2015 UTC,"Just some insight into my personal training.  I run between 7 - 11 miles 1-3x a week depending on how I feel generally, some days I'll recover within 24 hours, others you'll need 72 hours even though it's the exact same distance, at the end of the day, I'm a natural runner so it depends on how my body wants to recover, some aspects of fitness are out of my control.  If I don't run for a week, my first initial run will be sloppy, my muscles won't feel primed, my cardiovascular system won't feel warm so to speak.  Around 4-5 days is where I feel like I can perform at my peak level of running, and I can't eat anything heavy beforehand, and I like to be awake at least 6 hours or so before I run, within those 6 hours or so I will eat eggs (whole) and simple sugars (mainly from coffee or plain old sweets), if you want to have a caffeine drink before the run, make sure it's flat and make sure it's around 30 minutes before you start to warmup.  Final thing is, be warmed up, for me, I walk for 5-10 minutes, then I will run faster than my average running pace for around 3 minutes, so I'll bomb it near sprint pace for that pace of time. Then I'll simply walk for another 5-10 minutes or have another quick session of near sprints, warm down again with a few minutes of walking then I'm off for my run.  I should add, I feel like I can breathe slightly better on days I take cod liver oil, could be a placebo, but I am sure I have much less flem in my system when I do, thus my throat feels clear."

AdvancedFitness,3br1qm,dustofoblivion123,9,Wed Jul 1 13:33:32 2015 UTC,"If one wants to limit or maximize mTORC1 stimulation, for example to lose weight or gain muscle mass, then these factors must be controlled. This is mainly done through careful dieting, by controlling caloric intake, but also by controlling food choices as well. The saying 'calories in, calories out' is not entirely true, since different nutrients have a distinct impact on the human metabolism.   Even if mTORC1 is heightened it can't make energy from nothing to store.   For example, milk is probably the most mTORC1 stimulating food that exists, since it is highly insulinogenic (since it's digested quickly), meaning that it causes the pancreas to secrete a lot of insulin and is therefore transported to the metabolic pathway at a relatively fast rate, and also because it is rich in leucine and glutamine. Furthermore, it has been shown that, in pregnant women, regular milk consumption causes the transfer of biologically active exosomal messenger RNAs, which increases the mTORC1 pathway's overall effectiveness in offspring. Milk should probably not be consumed by mostly sedentary people, and should only be used by athletes and breastfed babies.   Yes dairy is extremely insulinogenic but that doesn't equate to being worse for weight loss. Firstly there is no relationship between dairy intake and weight gain. http://www.nutritionjrnl.com/article/S0899-9007(05)00380-1/abstract 2 3 4 There is also no evidence for dairy inhibiting weight loss. 1 2 3 4 5 6"
AdvancedFitness,3br1qm,Insamity,2,Wed Jul 1 15:06:04 2015 UTC,"This is a solid number of studies, and this is obviously extremely complex science that I don't pretend to fully understand, but a lot of the research that I've looked at discusses the idea that long term mTORC1 over-stimulation is associated with various diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer. Also, regular consumption of milk during pregnancy seems to also be associated with higher risk of those diseases in adult life in offspring, for reasons that I've already mentioned in the OP. What do you think of that?"
AdvancedFitness,3br1qm,Ballaticianaire,2,Wed Jul 1 21:07:43 2015 UTC,"The body doesn't really work like that though. It's not so binary, it's a constant flux. Even though you may have robust mTOR stimulation from a meal (as you would from most any meal, especially if there's any sort of AAs present or an insulin spike), but a few hours following that, mTOR would fall and catabolic signals begin to rise. That's why it doesn't necessarily matter much to prevent mTOR activation to lose fat.. or to maintain constant mTOR activation to gain muscle. It's about the total energy, if there's a surplus, your body will use it accordingly via anabolic pathways to promote protein synthesis, cell growth/proliferation, glycogen storage, and lipid storage. If there's a deficit, the opposite would occur, no matter if you ate literally every 2-3 hours, full of high protein foods, and maintained some mTOR stimulation.   However, what you say is true talking about the association of mTOR w/ obesity, diabetes, cancer, etc. The major problem there is simply a chronic energy surplus that's then compounded by maintaining a heightened mTOR response from eating constantly. That's the beauty of intermittent fasting - it may be able to mitigate some of the deleterious ramifications of a chronic surplus via catabolic/longevity pathways whilst fasting (AMPK/SIRT1 & 3/PGC-1 alpha, etc)."

Also, regular consumption of milk during pregnancy seems to also be associated with higher risk of those diseases in adult life in offspring, for reasons that I've already mentioned in the OP.   Well since it is just an association right now with many possible causative factors it is hard to really say."
AdvancedFitness,3br1qm,DeoxyriBROse,6,Thu Jul 2 16:59:36 2015 UTC,"If you look at insulin response for a single food source do you not lose sight of reality? Mixed meals cause varying insulin responses, seems a little reductionist.   James Krieger has written a multipart post about insulin that tackles some ideas towards it such as being the end all/be all for weight loss/gain (IMO very thoroughly), may be worth reading, I personally come back to it constantly to refresh myself lol (James is a very smart guy, easy to access on Facebook as well if you have a desire to talk to him about his article)."
AdvancedFitness,3br1qm,DeoxyriBROse,2,Wed Jul 1 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, but milk creates a great insulin response for the simple reason that it's hydrolized extremely quickly. To quote a research paper that explains better than I ever could myself:  'The insulinemic index of whole cow´s milk (148±14) and skim milk (140±13) is much higher than the glycemic indices of whole milk (42±5) and skim milk (37±9), repectively [53,54]. Fast hydrolysis and immediate intestinal absorption of insulinotropic amino acids of the whey protein fraction of cow´s milk raise insulin levels to much higher magnitudes than intestinal digestion of structural proteins such as beef (insulinemic index: 51) [53,54]. The major insulinotropic protein fraction of cow´s milk is the whey protein fraction [55]. Whey-derived leucine and other whey-derived amino acids stimulate glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) secretion of enteroendocrine K- and L-cells, respectively [56-60]. Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) activity is of critical importance for the biological activity and half-life of these incretins. Remarkably, milk protein-derived peptides have been shown to inhibit DPP-IV activity and thus increase incretin activity enhancing incretin-mediated insulin synthesis and secretion [61,62].'"

In someone with metabolic syndrome, simply reducing daily caloric intake will make a world of difference... But in a highly trained athlete with already near-optimal body composition, then I would say that nutritional choices can make a difference, although I could be wrong.

It's the last stage after prolonged over reaching and comes with a wide array of psychological and neurological symptoms. From personal experience I'm pretty confident that OTS was the reason that I quit competitive sports. Increased training load combined with personal issues resulted in me not making any progress over a year of hard training. In fact, my results plummeted and I had to stop training when it was too much effort just to walk. So I took a break that lasted for a year. After that I had no desire to start training again. I had no more love for sports. Only after 8 years did I start to like sports again and now it's my favorite hobby once more."

The biggest thing to remember in training is while you build volume you shouldn't be pushing effort. And while you are pushing effort you should be dropping volume or balancing out effort with easy days and recovery days.   A good coach told me once that less than half your workout comes from the workout itself. It takes good rest, relaxation, nutrition, and hydration to complete a good workout.   I've had years or overtraining and I didn't even realize it. I would constantly (even on easy runs) worry about my pace. It isn't until recently that I learned I need to take it easy! I have 2-3 hard workouts a week with one long run and 3 recovery days at least. My long run I will push the pace not to the point I'm running a tempo or anything but enough that that run gets me tired towards the end. Hard workouts are usually intervals. RECOVERY DAYS ARE SLOW! I mean slow! I'm a low 1:50 800 runner and my recovery days will some times be in the 8 minute/mile range. There is no exact training mold for every person. Listen to your body.   Focus on warming up and cooling down will do wonders for your body also! Always make sure to fluctuate your training schedule towards how you feel also. If you for some reason didn't get any sleep one night it is probably not a good idea to push yourself hard that next day but instead try to rest, relax, eat and drink properly."

When I was at, what I would call, the beginning of being an intermediate lifter I was following this program which had an A, B, and C day. You were supposed to do one workout every other day. I misunderstood and did all 3 workouts at the same time. It took me around 2-2.5 hours. I thought I was being weak and kept pushing myself. 2 weeks later (6-7 workouts later) I realized my mistake. I was consistently tired even though I was doing a dreamer bulk and eating approximately 5,000 calories a day. I wasn't sleeping properly either and I could tell. I'd be EXHAUSTED but would find it difficult to sleep sometimes. It really messes with you. If you feel like you're having issues then reassess your volume or intensity or both."

If you're feeling like shit, there's normally a good chance you just need some plain old sugar, just grab a bag of sweets (not chocolate) after your cardio or lifting and enjoy yourself, it'll boost your recovery second to none, better than any recovery from protein.  Fuck complex carbs, I ditched them long ago for recovery and will never, ever implement them into my diet for the purpose of providing energy and recovery, why you'd want a slow releasing source of energy boggles my mind, who the fuck wants a small amount of energy over x amount of minutes? You want energy? Get it from a quick acting sugar, you won't bomb after as long as you're body is normal i.e. diabetic, there's a reason Athletes have gel sachets, they are not a gimmick.  Also, if you're natty, expect shit weeks, expect it, there's a reason Athletes are on PEDs, it's a consistent lifestyle.

AdvancedFitness,3b8shs,RawMuscleLab,2,Sun Jun 28 03:03:07 2015 UTC,"Sugar is good in moderation as an intra-workout recovery aid (and when breaking a fast), because it is half fructose, and fructose is actually better at restoring liver glycogen than glucose is.  I would limit it to ~30 grams over the course of your workout.  When liver glycogen stores are mostly full, sugar is an inferior energy source. Fructose is poorly metabolized by tissues besides the liver, it is inflammatory, and it doesn't promote the same degree of anabolic response as non-sugar carbohydrates."

My personal suspicion is that this proprietary meal formula is absolutely nothing special, and that the published macronutrient/kcal breakdown is really all we need to know... but who knows. Maybe the protein source was really important to the results and we'll find this out later.  I do think the study should be criticized on the basis of what information is and isn't available to the reader, and in that sense, I do agree with you that without more information about what the study participants were consuming, it's really hard to decide how we should view the results. I'm not really loving the yeast data too much either. It's not rigorous enough to prove a point in yeast and for that reason it's not strong enough to potentially support the mouse/human data.

AdvancedFitness,3ani4e,Pejorativez,5,Sun Jun 21 23:20:59 2015 UTC,"The aim of this work was to study the effect of training volume on activation of satellite cells. Healthy untrained men were randomly assigned into two groups. The 3L-1UB group (n = 10) performed three-set leg exercises and single-set upper body exercises, and the 1L-3UB group (n = 11) performed single-set leg exercises and three-set upper body exercises. Both groups performed three sessions (80–90 min) per week for 11 weeks. Biopsies were taken from m. vastus lateralis and m. trapezius. The number of satellite cells, satellite cells positive for myogenin and MyoD, and the number of myonuclei were counted. Homogenized muscle was analyzed for myogenin and MyoD, and extracted ribonucleic acid (RNA) was monitored for selected growth factor transcripts. Knee extensor strength increased more in the 3L-1UB group than in the 1L-3UB group (48 ? 4% vs 29 ? 4%), whereas the strength gain in shoulder press was similar in both training groups. The number of satellite cells in m. vastus lateralis increased more in the 3L-1UB group than in the 1L-3UB group. The number of myonuclei increased similarly in both groups. The messenger RNA expression of growth factors peaked after 2 weeks of training. In conclusion, increasing training volume enhanced satellite cell numbers in the leg muscle, but not in the upper body muscle.      Strength was measured as one RM in the leg extension exercise and in the shoulder press exercise. Participants performed a standardized warm-up including three sets with gradually increasing load (40–75–85% of expected one RM) and decreasing number of repetitions (12–7–3). The first attempt in the one RM test was performed with a load approximately 5% below the expected one RM. After each successful attempt, the load was increased by 2%–5% until failure of lifting the load in two to three following attempts. The resting period between each attempt was 4 min. The one RM testing was overseen by the same investigator and conducted on the same equipment with identical subject/equipment positioning."

AdvancedFitness,3afo54,Hockeymd03,10,Fri Jun 19 19:23:08 2015 UTC,"As of now, there appears to be very little you can do about the larger than expected reduction in energy expenditure that occurs when obese individuals lose more than 10% of their body weight. In view of the fact that the Camps and Jaime studies show that the reduction in basal energy expenditure can be permanent and occurs irrespective of a loss of lean mass, it cannot be ascribed solely to either the temporary lack of dietary energy and respective reductions in energy expenditure or a diet-induced loss of metabolically active muscle or organ mass.   Bummer."
AdvancedFitness,3afo54,dreiter,6,Fri Jun 19 23:28:19 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, this discrepancy between hunger and energy expenditure is the reason why rapidly reaching a new 'weight loss' low in the overweight & obese is simply not an effective long-term solution. If you're an experienced athlete who 'nasty bulked' for 3 months and now wish to go back to your pre-bulk weight, then sure, going on a relatively big caloric deficit or even using a dangerous drug such as 2,4-Dinitrophenol might work. But if you're obese or overweight and you want to go from there to a 'visible six pack weight', first, it has to be slow and steady, and second, you have to accept the fact that there will be mental pain from hunger and all you can do is resist it and minimize it by eating lots of dietary fibers and other nutrients that increase the 'gastric fullness' effect that can be obtained from eating. I have been there. Being hungry all the time is hard, but right now, given what we understand of the human physiology, there seems to be no other way."

AdvancedFitness,3adysk,dustofoblivion123,4,Fri Jun 19 09:56:10 2015 UTC,"Full text  This study is unreliable/nonrepresentative because ""Twenty six healthy men volunteered to participate"".  Also, the findings have low confidence because N = 26 (placebo N=13 vs. BCAA N=13)  Interesting quotes:   The BCAAs supplementation was a mixture (2:1:1) of leucine,isoleucine and valine   Subjects were instructed to maintain their normal dietary habits and to fill a 10-day food log between D-6 and D4. This was done to monitor macronutrient intakes (especially for proteins) and to ensure that there was no significant difference between the experimental groups  We found no evidence indicating that the increased BCAAs availability could alleviate alterations of muscle function (i.e.,MVC, DOMS) and the related metabolic alterations (e.g.,pH homeostasis, mitochondrialfunction). In addition, the BCAA supplementation did affect neitherthe plasma CK activity nor the amino acids concentrations changes resulting from the damaging exercise  Highly damaged muscle was not able to get benefits out of the increased plasma BCAAs availability in order to attenuate changes in indirect markers of muscle damage and muscle metabolic alterations following NMES EIMD [exercise-induced muscle damage]. Further studies are needed in order to determine whether a potential association of BCAAs with free organic acid (e.g., taurine) intake could attenuate loss of muscle function and metabolic alterations associated with such a severe EIMD. Additional investigations are also required to deeply explore time course of amino acids changes within muscle with or without supplementation following severe EIMD.   My thoughts: the conclusion is not ""BCAA = no effect"" because of the issues I've mentioned above, but this study at least suggests that BCAA may not be effective for recovery."

AdvancedFitness,3a68dn,FK506,7,Wed Jun 17 18:14:21 2015 UTC,"Sort of, but only as a result of a failure of many physiological systems, if my understanding of the abstract is correct; my biochemistry is rusty, so any professionals please correct me.  The roadmap of regulatory circuits is actually rather simple: they state that previous research showed sodium ingestion leads to increased sodium in the bloodstream, and necessarily an increase in vasopressin (VP) in the pituitary gland (neurohypophysis). Normally, high levels of VP are mitigated by GABAergic inhibition in this structure caused by neural receptors in the aortic arch specifically tuned to blood pressure; this is essentially saying neural feedback from the body acts as a negative feedback system and stops VP from being further released.  Continuing, in this study they show with in vivo animal model that chronic salt (NaCl) intake impairs the blood pressure receptor-pituitary gland feedback system. This is done via two pathways:   First, by the VP-related neurons in the pituitary gland downregulating KCC2 receptors which are responsible for keeping intracellular chloride at optimal levels for neurons to work correctly. This directly affects GABAergic signals from inhibiting VP. Second, by activation of TrkB receptors, which perform multiple cellular differentiations and growth, via BDNF.   Additionally, salt itself increases VP neuron-firing, which essentially is a feed-forward system without the GABAergic stopgap. This increased level of VP without the normal way to decrease it causes arterial BP to be elevated.  I hope that clarifies somewhat."

Flavanols in general require more specific research for each individual compound  but I'd hypothesise that due to inherent synergy within whole food sources that it may be best to just eat a variety of plant sources anyway. There are obviously some that we have more knowledge of such as quercetin that may be of benefit to some from a supplemental source, but then you start to run into issues of form, dose, potential synergism etc."
AdvancedFitness,3a26zc,zoogwah,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:02:23 2015 UTC,"I was just looking this up yesterday!  Personally I would just use cocoa powder (not Dutch processed) and call it good.  I don't quite trust Mars' food science team to come up with a product as healthy as cocoa powder at this point, and not enough independent tests have been run yet.  This paper goes into the different measured values of some common (European) chocolates.  The two samples of 100% dark gave 0.25 and 0.9 mg flavanols per gram of product.  As far as cocoa powder, this paper discusses the flavanol content of cocoa at different levels of processing, with 'natural cocoa' being the highest at 35 mg/g, and 4 mg/g being the lowest.  So if you can find some 'natural cocoa' (Hershey Regular is mentioned) then that should result in the highest flavanol content."

In addition, the cocoa you suggest does not contain maltodextrin or sucralose."
AdvancedFitness,3a26zc,dreiter,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"Yes and if you look at the first paper I linked, flavanols aren't the only beneficial compounds in cocoa.  It's similar to how people take extract pills to get the beneficial effects of herbs and spices, but really those pills have been shown to not be beneficial, and that is because herbs and spices don't just have ONE single antioxidant, but dozens, hundreds, or thousands.  CocoVia seems like another example of trying to cash in the on antioxidant bandwagon."

Humans evolved eating a predominantly carb diet.   It'd be more interesting evaluating the long-term effects of a single day meal (no limit on calorie, 60-70% carbs, 20% protein, 10-20% fat), with high physical exercise occurring 1-2 hrs before meal time.  That would be more representative of paleolithic conditions, IMO.  And the human subjects would still dip into ketosis periodically through fasting without going on a high fat diet."

It does seem that different macronutrients are optimal for different types of energy expenditure. If humans need more stable forms of energy--vs. say, quick bursts--than a lipid based diet would offer advantages over a carb-heavy diet. In most white collar jobs, not many people need access to quick energy.   Technological and social changes have occurred very quickly over the last centuries. I would also wonder if, in light of technological, social, and lifestyle changes that have occurred relatively recently, in an evolutionary scale, that nutritional patterns are changing, too.

Turns out they were a lot harder than we thought, and since our supervisor didn't have to much experience on either we were on our own. Lots of agony later, I'm finishing up a PhD that isn't as elaborate as I had planned, because things didn't work out properly, and getting a thesis that I could have probably finished in three years, instead of five. You don't get any credit for things you tried and didn't work. You learn things, sure. But you can't publish that, and it doesn't help, at least at the PhD level, master's you can get away with it, but might diminish how you feel about it.  The best thesis is a finished thesis. I wouldn't ask Reddit about potential topics, I'd ask senior lab mates, they have an idea of how long it takes to get things done and what the actual capabilities of the equipment you have, as well as an idea of the maintenance and reliability of it.

Then they give an electrical twitch signal to see if you can stimulate the muscle further beyond maximal isomeric capacity. If the fatigue is cause by lowered CNS recruitment/ CNS fatigue then the electrical twitch would cause a muscle stimulation. However, if the fatigue is local/muscular in nature then the muscle will not contract further. Hope that explained a cool test you could use."

AdvancedFitness,39rvat,KetoLubber,17,Sun Jun 14 03:45:53 2015 UTC,"Some of this is good, some of this is completely wrong.   Can muscles count? A muscle doesn't automatically flip from strength to hypertrophy mode when eight reps have been achieved if the duration of the set hasn't been long enough or the intensity high enough to elicit sufficient lactic acid.  In order to achieve maximum hypertrophy, the muscle must be pushed to or near failure in order to achieve maximal protein degradation. If 60 percent is a 20RM, how is performing a set at 60 percent for 12 reps suppose to produce hypertrophy?   It's true that a muscle doesn't switch from strength to hypertrophy at 8 reps, but it's actually because the muscle was in hypertrophy mode the whole time. Rep range and time under tension don't matter for hypertrophy. It's possible that muscles need to be pushed to or near failure in order to maximally stimulate hypertrophy, but we actually don't have direct evidence of this yet. It makes sense because of Henneman's size principle, but just because it logically makes sense doesn't mean it's how a biological system will act.   There are two different types of hypertrophy—sarcoplasmic and sarcomere. While sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is responsible for the biggest improvements in size, sarcomere hypertrophy contributes more to strength gains. Think bodybuilder versus weightlifter.   Nope. There's no evidence that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy independent of myofibrillar hypertrophy exists.   When training for hypertrophy, in order to stay in a lactic state, short rest intervals must be used. This necessitates the ability of short-term muscular endurance in order to recover from previous sets so that subsequent sets will allow enough muscular tension to be maintained for maximal protein degradation and the buildup of metabolites that lead to hypertrophy.   Nope. The body evidence shows either no difference in hypertrophy with shorter versus longer rest times or superior hypertrophy with longer rest times.    When training for muscular endurance, performing sets of 15 reps of any exercise for an athlete who needs to work for 20 minutes to three hours or more is pointless but commonly prescribed. Athletes of this nature need muscular endurance that comes from ultra high rep sets (100 reps or more per set).   Strength training for endurance athletes is not meant to target cardiorespiratory endurance. This is a complete misunderstanding of why strength work is prescribed. Also, 100 reps per set is in no way going to simulate the endurance needed for 20 minutes any more than 15 reps is...  Overall, I think the article goes in an interesting direction. It starts off almost saying the same things I did when I wrote mine, and it's kind of cool to see that three years before I finally sat my ass down to write something (also, I haven't seen this article before). However, I think the author came to some wrong conclusions because a) they didn't let themselves be guided by the available evidence and b) a good chunk of the evidence contradicting them actually didn't exist at the time they wrote it."
AdvancedFitness,39rvat,Strikerrjones,3,Sun Jun 14 12:17:17 2015 UTC,"Quick question on what you commented on.  Even though there's no evidence that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is separate from myofibrillar hypertrophy... could altering the rep range change the utilization of that ""continuum?"" i.e. lower rep ranges with weights closer to your 1RM elicit more myofibrillar hypertrophy than rep ranges that utilize your 3-10RM+?  Also, is there a rep range that you wouldn't advise going beyond if goals are optimal (or near optimal) hypertrophy? Likewise is there a rep range you wouldn't advise lifting under (as a % of ur 1RM)?"
AdvancedFitness,39rvat,Strikerrjones,4,Sun Jun 14 12:45:20 2015 UTC,"I really doubt it. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is best thought of as a random idea a smart guy had to explain strength and size differences between bodybuilders and powerlifters, but those differences can be explained much better by things we do have evidence for. Also, there are plenty of bodybuilders who successfully compete in powerlifting while having those big bodybuilder muscles. Did they suddenly lose all their sarcoplasm and replace it with myofibrils? No."
AdvancedFitness,39rvat,Strikerrjones,6,Sun Jun 14 12:49:35 2015 UTC,Makes sense... thank you for clarifying. Basically hypertrophy will be fairly uniform as long as volume (total hard sets per muscle) is similar.   Adaptations of strength primarily come from neural coding.
AdvancedFitness,39rvat,Strikerrjones,2,Sun Jun 14 12:54:08 2015 UTC,Yep!
AdvancedFitness,39rvat,Ballaticianaire,3,Sun Jun 14 12:56:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, Strikerr last question... honestly appreciate you taking the time.  Do you have a specific rep range (as a % of your 1RM) that you would not advise going beyond (or below) if your goals are optimal hypertrophy?"
AdvancedFitness,39rvat,Strikerrjones,6,Sun Jun 14 13:04:25 2015 UTC,"No problem! I'm glad you're interested.  So, the lowest rep range we actually have evidence for showing the same hypertrophy as the usual 8-12RM is 2-4 reps to failure in one of Brad Schoenfeld's studies. A lot of people I've talked to (including Greg Nuckols) think that 1RM probably wouldn't be optimal for hypertrophy for multiple reasons, including not enough metabolite build up and the inability to do a whole bunch of sets with 1RM. Personally, I think if you did 8 sets of singles with 95-98% of your 1RM, you'd still see a good deal of hypertrophy. I'm literally the only person I've ever talked to who thinks that's a possibility though, so I'm probably wrong.  The lightest weight we have evidence for is 20% 1RM, but that study was done in untrained older people. I think Brad did 25-35 reps to failure in trained people and saw the same hypertrophy as 8-12.  The really important thing is to put high effort into sets and to do a lot of sets."
AdvancedFitness,39rvat,Ballaticianaire,2,Sun Jun 14 13:13:15 2015 UTC,"It's actually a bit myopic to suggest sarcoplasmic doesn't exist. Just because myofibrillar hyp and sarcoplasmic hyp usually occur concomitantly (and there's never any really egregious one-sided-ness), doesn't mean they can't be dichotomized based on mechanisms.  First and foremost, the king of hypertrophy knowledge himself has said several times it does exist and stated the alterations that occur in it, as do certain papers, eg: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2129160/  We see from Brad and the literature that it's a growth of non-contractile elements, such as collagen, nebulin, titin, vinculin, greater glycogen stores, more mitochondria, and so on. So I guess it's technically a misnomer and it's just non-myofibrillar hyp, but the name is convenient bc it's so well known.  Now, it's true volume is the most imporant factor, and the easiest way to get there is via the higher reps (8-15) you consistently see mentioned as optimal for hypertrophy. So that's one factor. The other is that there is a greater anabolic/survival signaling manifold being transduced via the metabolic stress. That's the main aspect that's modulated via that canonical bodybuilding style of training. This perturbs the membrane more via several factors (lactic acid & general metabolite accretion, cell swelling, etc), thus leading to greater anabolic signaling.  We even have some evidence of differential signaling via metabolic stress from a very recent study: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mus.24314/abstract  Now the question is if these are simply redudant and don't add much or if it's a large, cumulative effect (which I believe). Again, this isn't known 100%, but there's simply good reason to believe those typical rep recommendations promote augmented metabolic stress, cascading to greater hyp. At the very least, it's working through high volume alone. Conversely, this could explain the mechanism behind high volume (for the post part).  Now, time for the final caveat: either way, this type of hypertrophy specifically cannot occur seprately from myofibrillar hypertrophy, so it may not even be worth the separation. I, however, feel it is though - we are after being optimal in our approach, right? So, to recapitulate, it's not that the sarcoplasm:myonucleus ratio is shifting, it's just the obligatory growth of various non-contractile elements. I think it's heightened growth can be attributed to metabolic stress, which should be higher through higher rep ranges (8-15). At the very least, it's occuring via higher volume that follows with the training type."
AdvancedFitness,39rvat,Ballaticianaire,2,Mon Jun 15 05:59:07 2015 UTC,"I don't really disagree with anything you said here, but what you're describing is not the usual idea of sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. Actually, I think you make a case for not calling it myofibrillar hypertrophy either, since leaving out the hypertrophy of all the other proteins is just as misleading as sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.    Sarcoplasm can transiently increase/decrease independently of myofibrillar increase through water/sodium manipulation and carb loading, or even through just the pump you get from lifting. That to me is not hypertrophy. It just doesn't make sense to put it in the same category as fairly permanent muscle growth."
AdvancedFitness,39rvat,Strikerrjones,2,Mon Jun 15 12:24:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a matter of semantics I suppose. But eh I don't think this is off from the typical idea of sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. Most everyone (even broscientists) concede/realize it's a growth of non-contractile tissues. I don't think anyone really thought that the sarcoplasm itself just started growing.. you'd then have to ask by what mechanism, which would be non-contractile constituents, satellite cells, glycogen stores, etc etc. So the argument is the same imo. Maybe I have a skewed look at it anymore though.  I agree with this, but again, I don't think people really thought of that kind of ephemeral growth as sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. It's usually mentioned in the context of specifically training, and the bodybuilding style.. making it a training adaptation, not a diet manipulation."
AdvancedFitness,39rvat,pepperstonelove,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:33:55 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for this detailed reply... what you're saying does make sense.   Is there a rep range that you would not go beyond (as a % of your 1RM)?  My personal opinion is beyond the 15RM range is when you start to stray away from optimal hypertrophy. 6-15RM is where I feel comfortable.
AdvancedFitness,39rvat,thoramit,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:55:56 2015 UTC,"That's probably ideal. A varied amount of reps is good anyway. As for the specific targetting of that metabolic stress I talked about, I'd say the 12-15 range is probably ""idea"" for that, especially in terms of lactic acid concentrations and so on (and without switching to a predominant aerobic exercise).  To go back to that first point, they've shown significant hypertrophy in both extremes of the spectrum now. From low, ""powerlifting"" style of training (with high volume) to high reps (over 20, again high volume), they've still found, in short term studies, significant growth in training individuals.   The problem is how short these studies are and how slow of a process hypertrophy is. That makes it pretty much impossible to infer, directly from mechanistic data, which type of training is optimal for hypertrophy. The studies just aren't long enough. But, again, we do know all these types of training will produce massive growth provided the energy intake is there and you're using a good amount of volume (and putting effort forth)."

AdvancedFitness,39sa46,TheTr00per,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:06:23 2015 UTC,"I might be totally wrong, but in the paper it says:     BAT-dependent energy dissipation plays a central role in the defense against cold, a process that is dependent on mitochondrial energy dissipation mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 .     and   On the other hand, cold exposure and several other stimuli including cGMP signalling14 can induce browning, the appearance of inducible BA in WAT15, 16, 17, 18 — so-called beige or brite cells. Inducible BA share several characteristic features with classical BAT including multilocular lipid droplets, high mitochondria content and expression of UCP1, which allows them to consume energy like classical BA10, 16 .     and     The major focus of BAT research has been on cAMP, which is a key inducer of thermogenesis. Cold exposure results in the release of norepinephrine (NE) from sympathetic nerves in BAT and subsequent activation of β-adrenergic receptors that couple via Gs protein to adenylate cylcase, thereby stimulating cAMP production.     But the paper mainly claims that stimulation of sGC (which is a receptor for nitric oxide) can induce brown adipocytes which shares some characteristic features with classical brown adipose tissue.    So my logic was: 1. nitric oxide = good --> exercise can produce NO 2. cAMP = also good --> cold stimulates cAMP production  I don't really know how much difference cold showers will make, probably not a lot if at all.

Using this method I get to use my RSS aggregator and read only headlines and pass over the posts if the headline isn't enticing and this allows me to forego most crappy personal training/online training program sales attempts, product placement, bro science, or otherwise.

On the other hand, if you know you have some result, then at least you have confirmation of the phenomenon happening -- so an anecdote is a possible explanatory factor, and useful in that respect.  Certainly it's a type of evidence, just a weaker form of evidence than studies, but most people don't bother to make the distinction between ""weak"" and ""strong"" evidence because they think in terms of ""confirmed"" and ""unconfirmed.""

Trophoblast mTORC1 activation increases the cell surface density of amino acid transporters and thus links maternal nutrient availability and growth factor signaling to fetal growth by modulating the mTORC1-mediated flux of amino acids across the placenta, a mechanism that finally results fetal overgrowth  So if my mother was a heavy dairy consumer, do my cell surfaces still have a higher density of amino acid transporters or was that transient?  If I am a heavy diary consumer will all my new cells acquire this trait?  Finished. Only first 64 pages are paper. The rest are citations.

A simple example of that is the fact that insulin can increase transport of nutrients into skeletal muscle cells and activate ribosomal protein pathways, and yet also increases adipose tissue uptake of triglycerides and inhibits the hormone-sensitive lipase pathways.   The role of mTORC1 is merely to activate protein translation... Whether that is a good or bad thing depends on an unimaginably high number of factors."

Squat speed for novice and experienced lifter has a strong inverse correlation with RPE/RIR. Experienced squatters reported higher RPE's and near maximal loads. I'll say this is just knowing how to push your limits and know what your body can do.   I do not, however, understand the practical value of such knowledge.

AdvancedFitness,398b4t,mattlikespeoples,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:49:20 2015 UTC,The RPE scale was created for powerlifting. It is used by people that like to autoregulate their training set by set. You still follow programs but instead of percentages you use RPEs to regulate how heavy you go and when to increase or decrease the number of sets. This gives you the possibility to lift more when you feel recovered and decrease when you have a bad day. Whereas a percentage program was believed to be too rigid.  Sheiko and Dietmar which both heavily rely on percentage based programs also states that you should have some auto regulation in your training. But instead of labeling it they have just said that you should increase the weight if it is too easy.

AdvancedFitness,38yo3m,agpennypacker,0,Wed Jun 10 06:58:50 2015 UTC,"It's a concept of training that entails utilizing multiple rep ranges in the same week.   The format would go something like this... although the applications are virtually limitless.   Week 1  Workout 1 - Main body parts in the 12-15RM range. Accessories in the 8-10RM range. High Volume/Low Intensity  Workout 2 - Main body parts in the 10-12RM range. Accessories in the 10-12RM range. Medium Volume/Medium Intensity  Workout 3 - Main body parts in the 8-10RM range. Accessories in the 12-15RM range. Low Volume/High Intensity  Week 2 would be the same thing, except you progress by either adding more volume, adding +5-10 lbs to each lift (whether dumbbell or barbell) a set amount of weight... etc. There're a million ways to do it - one is not necessarily more ideal than the other... the concept of undulating the rep ranges is the most important thing to take away from this.  Generally you want to train in 4-6 week blocks with this. You can tailor these blocks toward strength, power, hypertrophy, etc. The example I gave above is tailored more toward hypertrophy... but you will still gain strength benefits regardless (just not the main focus). Most people don't understand that training in these rep ranges will still yield ridiculous strength benefits.   The 1st week you find the weights that work well for you that still allow progression. 2nd week is still the adjustment phase as your body acclimates to the new rep ranges... and weeks 3-5 (depending on how your body handles the volume) should be balls to the wall; you want to overreach during these 2-3 weeks without overtraining (it would be very hard to overtrain in that short amount of time anyway.   Once you overreach; that's when you deload 50% of the volume for an entire week, and allow your body to supercompensate. You don't want to take time away from the gym; you still want to perform the lifts to allow blood flow and nutrients to reach your muscles to recover. It will be very tempting to take time away completely from the gym because you'll be so exhausted if you pushed yourself properly, but you must continue for that last deload week.  Supercompensation is where the real muscle growth happens."

I may not get it 100%.  22 overweight ladies of varying ages between 23-44 and with a bmi of 25 to 32 had their calories reduced to 20 calories per kilogram of bodyweight. (60 kg woman would eat 1200 calories a day, basically). In the beginning, they measured their body composition (fat, bone density etc) with Dexa and tested their resting energy expenditure (REE: the energy you use while doing nothing).  The goal for each participant was to lose 5% of their body weight in the three months.  WHen you lose bodyweight, your REE goes down, because you have less fat/muscle etc to burn. That's expected. But even with that expected adjustment, the women who actually made the 5% loss goal had a REE drop significantly (168 calories per day). The women who did not make the 5% weightloss goal, did not have this significant reduction (theirs was like 1.4 something calories a day).  Important note: fat free mass (their lean muscle mass basically) didn't change--so it wasn't a factor in the lowering of metabolism.  The conclusion is that metobolic adaption is probably real. (metabolism drops significantly after dieting, even for 3 months).  Things to consider about this study:   Which dieters hit the 5% mark? Is it the higher BMI or the lower BMI? The number of participants was really small. 22 women of varying ages and varying weights isn't significant to the population. The women were encouraged to be active but there's nothing saying what kind of activity they did, if they did it and if it included resistance training or cardio or nothing.   my conclusion: It's interesting, but not a terrific study?

AdvancedFitness,38snoi,everphilski,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:52:57 2015 UTC,"I was shooting for about a pound a week, yes. I tracked calories and protein, I didn't explicitly drop carbs in favor of fats but I do prefer fats to carbs and find myself more filled by them. Never done PSMF. I am a proponent of intermittent fasting (when you have a limited time window to eat, you eat a few big meals instead of pining for little snacks all day. I still say it should be called 'intermittent feasting'). Ramping calories up serves a few different purposes. For one, your metabolism will go down over the course of a diet and you can estimate but not know perfectly your maintenance calories, so you ramp your calories up by say 100 cals/day for the month or every two weeks and watch how you respond to determine maintenance. It also prevents your body from hoarding fat if you were to instead add 500/day the day you end your diet, your body will say 'gee, surplus, best hoard that' ... hope that makes sense."

Materials and Methods  In vivo  Six normal men (age range, 21-28 yr), all within 15% of ideal body weight and taking no medication known to interfere with GH secretion, were studied. The purpose of the study was explained to each man, who gave their informed consent. The men were studied on four different occasions in a randomized fashion separated by at least 7 days. After an overnight fast, a cannula was placed in a forearm vein between 0800-0900 h. Blood samples were collected at 15-min intervals for 30 min before and 120 min after the start of each infusion. The men remained recumbent throughout the study procedure.  The protocol consisted of: test 1) Arg-TRH, 500 mL Arg-HC1 (60 mg/mL) were infused in 30 min, at the end of which 200 ng TRH were injected as an iv bolus; test 2) GHRH-Arg-TRH, the same study was repeated with the addition of 100 fig GHRH-(l-44) (Somatobiss, Bissendorf Biochemicals GmbH, Hannover, West Germany), which was given as an iv bolus immediately before the start of the Arg infusion; test 3) GHRH test, 100 ng GHRH were injected as an iv bolus at 0 min; and test 4) TRH test, 200 fig TRH were given as an iv bolus at 30 min.  The serum samples for the GH, TSH, PRL, and insulin determinations were stored at —20 C until assayed. Serum GH, PRL, and insulin were measured in triplicate with conventional double antibody RIA (7). Serum TSH was measured by immunoradiometric assay using two different monoclonal TSH antibodies (Serono Diagnostics, Freiburg, West Germany). The interassay variation was 7% for GH, 9.3% for PRL, and 3.2% for TSH; intraassay variations were 3.8%, 7.8%, and 2.6%, respectively. Blood glucose was determined enzymatically. All samples from all individual men were analyzed at the same time in each assay."

AdvancedFitness,38cq93,NoYouTryAnother,10,Wed Jun 3 16:57:13 2015 UTC,"Intro section on the wiki fructolysis page sums it up pretty well:   Though the metabolism of glucose through glycolysis uses many of the same enzymes and intermediate structures as those in fructolysis, the two sugars have very different metabolic fates in human metabolism. Unlike glucose, which is metabolized widely in the body, fructose is metabolized almost completely in the liver in humans, where it is directed toward replenishment of liver glycogen and triglyceride synthesis.[1] Under one percent of ingested fructose is directly converted to plasma triglyceride.2 29% - 54% of fructose is converted in liver to glucose, and about quarter of fructose is converted to lactate. 15% - 18% is converted to glycogen.3 Glucose and lactate are then used normally as energy to fuel cells all over the body.2  Fructose is a dietary monosaccharide present naturally in fruits and vegetables, either as free fructose or as part of the disaccharide sucrose, and as free monosaccharides in honey. It is also present in the form of refined sugars including granulated sugars (white crystalline table sugar, brown sugar, confectioner's sugar, and turbinado sugar), refined crystalline fructose and as high fructose corn syrups. About 10% of the calories contained in the Western diet are supplied by fructose (approximately 55 g/day).[4]  Unlike glucose, fructose is not an insulin secretagogue, and can in fact lower circulating insulin.5 In addition to liver, fructose is metabolized in intestine, testis, kidney, skeletal muscle, fat tissue and brain,67 but it is not transported into cells via insulin-sensitive pathways (insulin regulated transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4). Instead fructose is taken in by GLUT5.   If anyone would like, I've got a PDF copy of Lehninger's Principle's of Biochemistry (6th ed., 2012) I can send their way."

Such mice, albeit more adipose, nonetheless have improved cardiometabolic outcomes, including insulin, GTT, HOMA, lipids, and blood pressure (Solon-Biet et al., 2014). It is also important to consider the type of carbohydrate consumed (e.g., starch versus fructose versus glucose [Wylie-Rosett et al., 2004]) as this has been shown in rodent studies to have a profound influence on the development of obesity and insulin resistance (Maki and Phillips, 2015, Storlien et al., 1988, Thorburn et al., 1989 and Thresher et al., 2000) and thus may have a considerable effect on cardiometabolic health if fructose is a significant component of an LPHC diet.

AdvancedFitness,389hdx,richielaw,16,Tue Jun 2 20:21:23 2015 UTC,"Also, what I said in my response to the original posting over in r/science — the benefits of calorie restriction come from protein restriction. The benefits of protein restriction come from methionine restriction. Methionine restriction is important because the ratio of methionine to glycine matters. But you can just increase your intake of glycine—and get all the many, many other benefits of glycine intake that way as well.   Why low-carbers don't have any reason to ""flip out"" about this (if they understand the actual mechanism, which many do):  There's other evidence that the mechanism responsible for this is not protein intake (nor calorie intake), but rather the methionine:glycine ratio of one's diet. Methionine is an amino acid highly present in animal muscle meat. Glycine is highly present in the bones and gelatinous tissue. Since we don't eat whole animals anymore, a typical diet involving meat is going to get a lot of methionine and little glycine.   Obviously, there are two ways one could solve this: 1. restrict methionine by reducing protein in general (and muscle meat protein in particular); 2. just up your intake of glycine (hence the rising popularity of things like bone broth: intelligent low-carbers are already aware of this).  For a collection of relevant studies, see here. Especially footnote 10: The FASEB Journal. 2011;25:528.2. Dietary glycine supplementation mimics lifespan extension by dietary methionine restriction in Fisher 344 rats. BrindJ , Malloy V, Augie I, Caliendo N, Vogelman JH, Zimmerman JA, Orentreich N.

So are these toxicity-inducing levels and ratios of methionine likely to even show up in ordinary diets? If not and glycine is supplemented in ordinary conditions, does it still have these effects? If so and more modest amounts of glycine are supplemented in the context of a more modestly “high methionine” diet, is there any reason to think threonine would be reduced enough then to actually matter?  Finally, threonine is a precursor to glycine. Are there any concrete reasons why I should think that if glycine does reduce threonine in the context of an ordinary diet, that isn't just the body regulating conversion of amino acids in proportion to need, with the need for threonine as a glycine precursor reduced through direct intake of glycine? How efficiently does glycine intake free up threonine use for its other more essential purposes?  (And yes, how much threonine were they taking in, and from what kind of sources? Eggs are actually the top source of threonine by far (see here), followed by seafood, meat, milk and cottage cheese holding all the top spots (apart from soy and a few seeds). So it seems extremely implausible that someone eating these foods is going to get a threonine deficiency in any case.)"

The Life Extension Foundation discusses a few other important studies on the impact of broth on inflammation in the context of osteoporosis here: “Despite the fact that half of all prescriptions for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen are written for osteoarthritis, those drugs do nothing more than transiently blunt the pain. They have no long-term impact on the disease itself.1  In the year 2000, scientists discovered that chicken soup actually inhibited the attraction of immune system cells called neutrophils to the site of inflammation. 2”  Valid? I don't know, but it's just scratching the surface of what that link showed no awareness of and didn't discuss, so it seems to me quite clear that saying the health benefits of broth are “a complete and utter myth” are just as much overblown rhetoric as anything you think you’re critiquing here.   ""The addition of glycine to the high methionine diet effectively suppressed the enhancement of the hepatic methionine level and almost completely restored the glycine level, but it only partially restored the serine level and further decreased the threonine level.""   — See my response to cilantrod’s comment, below.   ""The link between the consumption of animal products and negative health outcomes includes a wide variety of factors and it is not limited to just THE mechanism of methionine metabolism.""    Sure. But most of what we believe about the health benefits of meat comes from observational population studies which rely on self-reports to determine what people's diets are, and these are poor ways to determine anything meaningful for countless reasons: not least that some 60% of people who call themselves “vegetarians” on those surveys have recently eaten hamburger in the last 24 hours. (So labeling oneself “vegetarian” turns out to correlate most closely with a desire to do conventionally ""healthy"" things, so survey–""vegetarians"" exercise more and smoke far less despite not really being vegetarian).   Furthermore, people with serious illnesses are more likely to overreport their meat intake (which obviously skews population correlations because people with serious illnesses die more than people who don't), while women underreport their intake more problematically than men—relevant because women live seven years longer than men in the first place, which likely has to do with things that are completely unrelated, like men's higher acute and chronic cortisol responses playing a role in progression of metabolic syndromes. All this adds up to explain why obesity researchers now say self-reported dietary intake now has no valid role in clinical study or treatment of obesity anymore whatsoever. And that's without the problems specifically known to exist with regard to meat; that's just for “hey, did you eat a fuck ton of food in general yesterday? Or not?”   What might the real-world impacts of Neu5Gc be on longevity? We don't know. But we do have direct experimental evidence that methionine:glycine ratios play a role in some large part, if not all, of that impact in studies that measured the impacts of dietary intake on longevity directly. That's far stronger  as evidence than any inductive extrapolation based on theoretical models of biochemistry is capable of being.  In any case, I know these aren't the sources you'll want, but I'm running out of time to go digging for primary research sources and these links should have them. I'm reminded of The China Study's research on cancer in rats. What Campbell actually found was that high protein fuels the growth of cancer in somebody who already has it. But that's precisely just because protein promotes growth in general - just like caseine fed cancer better than other proteins in rats who already had cancer, other studies show caseine and whey promote muscle growth better than almost all other protein sources (search Suppversity for info on that). So if plant protein feeds it less, that's probably because it's less bioavailable in the first place: which might be bad when you don't want the effects of protein but good for exactly that same reason when you do.  If you don't already have cancer, protein isn't feeding the growth of cancer. Indeed, other studies referenced in the link below like Campbell's srudy found that higher protein diets were more protective against getting cancer in the first place even though anyone who already has cancer should still probably reduce protein intake so as not to fuel the cancer's growth once they actually do know that it's active inside of their bodies. ""Protein helps you not get cancer"" and ""protein will speed your cancer and make you die faster if you already have it"" are not mutually exclusive.  (Links to that should be contained in here, and again I'm sorry to WAPF you, but the primary research is in there; I just don't have any more time left.) Neu5Gc could very well be something like that: only really troublesome if there's already cancer there for the sugar to feed. In the real world, we just don't know ye. The jury is out. But it isn't out on the studies I referenced directly, experimentally showing a direct impact of glycine on longevity. And since it does it by reducing the impacts of methionine, that in and of itself is direct evidence that methionine is the key player in this phenomena—and the only one we have any such direct evidence for so far."

You recommended bone broth and mentioned the paleo community, which has embraced BB as superfood that promotes health through a variety of alleged mechanisms - all without any substantiation. If you want your claim to be so narrowly interpreted to only mean that it is a good source of bio-available collagen, well where is the data? You also want to make claims about the synergistic affects of food, but recommend a product (BB) which according to the link has extremely low content of vitamins and minerals. According to the link the protein content is between 12-30g for a product (BB) that can be made in a variety of ways from a variety of sources - so broad claims without substantiation (you) are inappropriate.   Do you know that the protein is mostly collagen? How much meat was left on the bones before they were roasted and slow cooked - a process known to reduce the bio-availability of some nutrients within food (there goes your synergy again...)?  The data on BB is extremely sparse and the ideal composition / cooking method of creating BB is not known either. The protein content of BB is all over the place and it is merely assumed that it is mostly collagen but again I find nothing to substantiate this.  I also noticed you ignored everything said about bio-accumulation and bio-magnification: tendon is an example of tissue where various compounds from the environment accumulate so the same risks of ingesting environmental pollutants and other toxins remains.    Still, this is hardly any thorough review of the direct or indirect evidence on bone broth, anyway. A study in rabbits actually did find experimentally that bone broth improved their rate of bone healing (p.72).   Are you under the impression that I do not notice you are very selective which what evidence you decide is scientific? You want bash the methodology and rigor of observational studies, but then marry yourself to the rat model which is known to produce many promising dead ends. Rabbits have a two-stage digestive system to break down plant cellulose and access nutrients absorbed as a part of their strictly herbivorous diet. Is there a mechanism prompted by digesting BB in rabbits that is similar to humans? It quite a leap to take a small study in one journal using non-similar animal model to make broad claims about the benefits of something to human health.    The Life Extension Foundation discusses a few other important studies on the impact of broth on inflammation in the context of osteoporosis here: “Despite the fact that half of all prescriptions for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen are written for osteoarthritis, those drugs do nothing more than transiently blunt the pain. They have no long-term impact on the disease itself.1   Irrelevant.    In the year 2000, scientists discovered that chicken soup actually inhibited the attraction of immune system cells called neutrophils to the site of inflammation. 2”   Ah yes in vitro studies, like rat models lead to many promising dead ends and should not be the starting point for treatments but investigation (chicken soup usually contains cysteine which may speak more to the qualities of specifically that AA than it does generally chicken soup). Traditional chicken soups include loads of vegetables and other ingredients and do not typically consist of bone simmered for days with no other added ingredients. It is not comparable at all.    Valid? I don't know, but it's just scratching the surface of what that link showed no awareness of and didn't discuss, so it seems to me quite clear that saying the health benefits of broth are “a complete and utter myth” are just as much overblown rhetoric as anything you think you’re critiquing here.   The data does not back you at all. Your wink-and-nods about paleo dieters being in the 'know' (hence BB) is overblown rhetoric and that is what was critiqued with the provided links and studies. One form of BB MAY in vitro (And that was more of a soup than a broth) have an affect on limiting the duration and severity of the 'common cold', but that is a far cry and away from the various claims (especially made by you) in regards to its properties as some sort of healthy glycine supplement.  This doesn't even hit on the fact that preparation is energy intensive - days to prepare compared to the hour it takes to bake something and eat it (of course while also not running the risk of denaturing the various nutrients and enzymes in the amount you accomplish boiling something for days).    Sure. But most of what we believe about the health benefits of meat comes from observational population studies which rely on self-reports to determine what people's diets are, and these are poor ways to determine anything meaningful for countless reasons: not least that some 60% of people who call themselves “vegetarians” on those surveys have recently eaten hamburger in the last 24 hours. (So labeling oneself “vegetarian” turns out to correlate most closely with a desire to do conventionally ""healthy"" things, so survey–""vegetarians"" exercise more and smoke far less despite not really being vegetarian).   You are now being completely disingenuous and prove that you have only the barest (shallow) understanding of the nutritional sciences and their methodology. The landmark studies in nutrition do not rely solely on asking someone once a weak what they remember eating: the Framingham Heart Study, Key's Seven Nations Study, The China Study and the Nurses Health Study were comprehensive longitudinal studies. Confusion over identity (plenty of people confuse pescetarianism with vegetarianism - I did for the longest time) does not invalidate decades of of some of the greatest work in this history of epistemology.   In addition the various ways in which meat has come to associate with negative health-outcomes does not just come from observational studies: bioaccumulation is testable in a lab, high protein load stressing the renal system is testable in a lab.  The likes of Dr. Essylsten, Dr. Ornish, and Dr. McDougall have also run their own small studies where they know exactly what their patients are eating and their results (as preliminary as they are) lend some credence to the idea that meat consumption worsens outcomes for people suffering from CAD.   Finally, diet is a behavior that occurs over time - what other method of study would you have them to to investigate something other than longitudinal observational studies? You are aware that various methods exist in statistics to to control for various confounding variables yes? I sure hope so.   What might the real-world impacts of Neu5Gc be on longevity? We don't know. But we do have direct experimental evidence that methionine:glycine ratios play a role in some large part, if not all, of that impact in studies that measured the impacts of dietary intake on longevity directly. That's far stronger as evidence than any inductive extrapolation based on theoretical models of biochemistry is capable of being.   I don't know I guess cancer-promoting compounds obviously have no affect on longevity at all /s  Also we have direct experimental evidence in some rats (some mouse models respond less favorably to CRAN) than methionine plays a role in in aging via oxidative stress: again funny you put so much emphasis on a rat/mouse model (promising dead ends) but then poopoo methods that observe and measure the activities of actual humans consuming actual food. You can not cherry-pick your science.   In any case, I know these aren't the sources you'll want, but I'm running out of time to go digging for primary research sources and these links should have them.

And rats on a high fat, low sugar diet, gained very little weight (only statistically significant, but not practically). However, the rats that did gain weight, were the ones fed both high sugar and high fat diets.   That when taken alone, our bodies don't indulge: Sugar is too sweet, and fat is too greasy.

It's unpredictable.   In Epstein's book The Sports Gene he discusses a study (also cited elsewhere but I can't find a link at the mo) in which strength adaptations seemed to fall into particular intervals. There were a few people at an absolute upper limit, some at 75% of that, some at 50%, a few at 25%, and even a very few unlucky outliers who did not seem to adapt to strength training at all.

They gained, on average, 1.9kg of FFM (around 2.5% bw) and lost 0.2kg of fat over the 8 week period. However, the researchers mention that:   Although there was no significant change in the mean value for body weight, body fat, lean body mass or percent fat, the individual responses were quite varied.   The average FFM gains in this study, while not significant, nonetheless fall in line with the broscience 1/2lb per week recommendations."
AdvancedFitness,389yd4,DanH27,3,Tue Jun 2 21:09:40 2015 UTC,"The portion about weight and sports performance not necessarily being a correlation is a great one. I think too many athletes fixate on how much they weigh, and not necessarily on constructive power output."
AdvancedFitness,389yd4,freedomfitgymva,2,Wed Jun 3 13:25:31 2015 UTC,"I would argue that this is because, at the highest level, absolute strength overpowers relative strength.

Of course there are other factors, but if we're about strength specifically, that's what I think."
AdvancedFitness,389yd4,dustofoblivion123,2,Thu Jun 4 09:41:40 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. The fixation though may be on some of the wrong ideals per athlete/position. An offensive lineman needs to train differently than a wide receiver. However, two offensive linemen shouldn't train with the exact same methodology because at the end of the day, they'll each have different uses and genetics. The same goes for two different wide-receiver. The ideal is to be the fastest, tallest, jump-highest and catch the ball. But a 6'4"" wide receiver with small joints and bone structure vs. a 6""1 wide receiver with larger joints and a slightly larger bone-structure should both have different training goals, instead of individually shooting for (example) 195 pounds.  Genetically, the larger-structured, shorter receiver excels at that weight, but the taller, lighter-structured one is more efficient at 186. If he strives for that generalized 195, he may lose those little gifts he excelled at at 186.  Perhaps that example represents what I said a little more. I'm not arguing you're wrong, because you're absolutely not. I'm trying to add clarity to my justifications of why ""absolute strength overpowers relative strength"" aren't necessarily functional perimeters for athletic measurement."

I may suggest independent manipulation of variables once they have shown their willingness to follow various principles pertaining to their goal.

I'll usually provide a circuit of 8-10 exercises with some simple mobility stuff between more challenging exercises.  If they show me they can do that for a few weeks and understand it, I'll give them something more complex.  For a powerlifter or an athlete I'm providing programming to, I'll give them just about everything from what warm-up to do, all their sets/reps for the main exercise(s), what assistance exercises, conditioning, and recovery work.  Some of that that might involve supersetting exercises, circuits, using tempo for certain things, etc.  But all depends on the person and what I think he/she can handle."

It sounds like that is a more of a whole body workout, so do you have more specific days when you work with them in their sessions (like push/pull) or is it just simple version of what you normally do?  I usually focus on more major/complex days in training sessions (with a push/pull split) and assign more supplementary and isolated stuff when they are on their own for a third day and would require less coaching. Over the years of seeing how many times that third workout does not necessarily get done, I have taken any 'key' exercises for that client out of it.

AdvancedFitness,37ncjt,Pejorativez,12,Thu May 28 22:15:51 2015 UTC,"ABSTRACT   The purpose of this study was to compare different split resistance training routines on body composition and muscular strength in elite bodybuilders. Ten male bodybuilders (26.7 ± 2.7 years, 85.3 ± 10.4 kg) were randomly assigned into one of two resistance training groups: 4 and 6 times per week (G4X and G6X, respectively), in which the individuals trained for 4 weeks, 4 sets for each exercise performing 6-12 repetitions maximum (RM) in a pyramid fashion. Body composition was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, muscle strength was evaluated by 1RM bench press testing. The food intake was planned by nutritionists and offered individually throughout the duration of the experiment. Significant increases (P < 0.05) in fat-free mass (G4X = +4.2%, G6X = +3.5%) and muscular strength (G4X = +8.4%, G6X = +11.4%) with no group by time interaction were observed. We conclude that 4 and 6 weekly sessions frequencies of resistance training promote similar increases in fat-free mass and muscular strength in elite bodybuilders.  Conclusion  We conclude that 4 and 6 weekly sessions frequencies of resistance training promote similar increases in fat-free mass and muscular strength in elite bodybuilders when the body part frequency is matched. Therefore, those seeking maximize muscle mass can take a flexible approach to this aspect of program design and tailor training frequency to lifestyle preferences and  individual  response  to  the  respective  training programs.  Specifically,  an  individual  can either choose to spend more days training each week for less time per session or to train for a longer duration each session with fewer total training days per week."

AdvancedFitness,37ks95,emanresu_sdrawkcab,8,Thu May 28 14:28:16 2015 UTC,"Little help, please link that article.  The only one I could find was this one:  http://www.leangains.com/2010/06/intermittent-fasting-and-stubborn-body.html  Which only links this study:   We studied changes in lipid metabolism in adipose tissue in 24 healthy adults during early starvation (14-20 h) by cannulating the venous drainage of the subcutaneous adipose tissue of the anterior abdominal wall. Net nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) efflux from adipose tissue increased steadily from 1,790 +/- 300 to 2,360 +/- 290 nmol.100 g-1.min-1 (P = 0.03), due to increasing transcapillary efflux of NEFA (release from adipocytes; P < 0.01). The reesterification rate after an overnight fast was close to zero; thus, reduction in the rate of reesterification played no part in the increased transcapillary efflux of NEFA. One-quarter of the net efflux of NEFA after an overnight fast arose from the action of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), although this relative contribution decreased during the study (P < 0.02). The increased transcapillary efflux of NEFA reflected a significant increase in the rate of action of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; P = 0.03). There was a strong relationship between mean arterial NEFA concentration and net NEFA release from adipose tissue (P < 0.001), implying that the particular depot studied reflects the behavior of adipose tissue as a whole. Thus the increasing efflux of NEFA from adipose tissue observed during early starvation is due to an increased rate of action of HSL, which may in turn be regulated by a fall in the plasma insulin concentration.   And also has this notation in the article from Martin:   If we compare a traditional calorie deficit of 3500 kcal per week on a conservative diet vs 3500 kcal on an intermittent fasting setup (or with The Stubborn Fat Solution), would there be any difference in regional fat loss assuming all other factors were kept constant? I don't think we'll ever know, so this boils down to relying on theory and practical experience.   Intermittent Fasting sounds plausible, but at the current state has too much magic associated with it.  Studies on IF itself as it DIRECTLY impacts claims is very, very much needed. Lyle and Martin have done a ton of work showing the theories are plausible for predictable outcomes, a few studies that don't involve diabetic rats would be wonderful and justified."

So if say, a person was on both and went into anaphylaxis, would they be screwed? Epi-pens are essentially adrenaline shots, but if adrenaline has no effect, they wouldn't work would they? And if beta-blockers interfere with fat-loss, then for a lot of people taking them they interfere with fixing the root cause of their high blood pressure or heart condition (not that this means they shouldn't be used, keeping the patient alive long enough to lose weight is probably the more important thing, even if it means it takes them longer to lose it)."
AdvancedFitness,37ks95,SlimSlamtheFlimFlam,2,Thu May 28 20:58:03 2015 UTC,Oh got it. It doesn't make overall fat loss harder but the order in which you lose fat changes.
AdvancedFitness,37ks95,dallen13,2,Thu May 28 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"Activating alpha-receptors prevents fat from being burned   So, I'm on this drug called Prazosin for PTSD. (tl;dr: it's an alpha-adrenergic blocker that lowers norepinephrine levels). I'm also lifting, started keto a month and a half ago, and want to get into biking and some sort of martial art this summer. Will Prazosin help me burn more fat?"
AdvancedFitness,37ks95,skaray,1 point,Thu May 28 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"To specify, it's because of these receptors' effects on cAMP.  Alpha-adrenoreceptors decrease cAMP production, and beta-adrenoreceptors increase cAMP production. Activation of any receptor present on adipose cells that stimulates cAMP formation will have the same effect (on adipose tissue, that is)."
AdvancedFitness,37ks95,OsOsG,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:27:19 2015 UTC,So if i increase blood flow to the area itll almost be like targeted fat burn?
AdvancedFitness,37ks95,jam97322,3,Thu May 28 11:31:13 2015 UTC,Um. Theoretically it could help but practically who knows. It could be that slower burning areas cause lower blood flow and not vice versa.
AdvancedFitness,37ks95,Smoda,-2,Thu May 28 11:38:04 2015 UTC,Also Ketogenic\low carb diet has advantage on decreasing fat stores around areas where alpha receptor more present through depleted glycogen stores which results in down regulated alpha receptors   IF+Keto\low carb = can be interesting solution for getting the stubborn fat off before any other or at least at higher ratio to the rest of the body

AdvancedFitness,37mivc,failon,1 point,Thu May 28 22:45:57 2015 UTC,I love counter conventional data.  The thinking seems to have been 'shoulder pain? Must be from shoulder movement.'   Now maybe that isn't the case. I hope this leads somewhere
AdvancedFitness,37mivc,Pejorativez,1 point,Thu May 28 23:04:55 2015 UTC,"Anecdotally, my shoulders feel orders of magnitude better when I regularly military press. And I have AC joint degeneration, bicipital tendinitis, and congenital labrum malformation. Getting the scapula and humerus moving together in those positions under load really seems to even out my entire shoulder girdle and get me out of painful cycles.  It's important to note however, that shoulder pathologies are still common among overhead athletes. If I had to guess, I'd say that's because most overhead athletes are not just strictly pressing weight overhead. They're hitting and throwing things. Look at a volleyball spike. The arm's overhead but now you're exerting a force forward and down with the hand. That's gonna anteriorly tilt the scapula and the humerus is going to be levered into the acromion, potentially wreaking havoc on the soft tissue structures in the top of the glenohumeral joint.  But strict lifting overhead? Golden, if you can get the scapula to actually move the way it should. Not everyone can right off the bat."

AdvancedFitness,37h2z6,eaglessoar,2,Wed May 27 16:12:04 2015 UTC,"I have one. It's fun, and probably useful if you follow their recommendations, but I found the app lacking a bit in terms of what metrics you have available. For example, there's no way to compare your progress workout to workout. It's a bit of a shame, because the data is all there - it wouldn't be too difficult to add lots of snazzy charts and ways to present it, which is really what I wanted when I got it. Right now it's just a workout log.  To answer your question, yes, you can log your dumbell OHP using the regular OHP or whatever. I don't think the data will get too messed up if you do, as long as the exercise follows a similar movement pattern.   I'm hoping the app gets better, and to their credit, they are updating it a lot. But for now, my Push band isn't seeing much use."
AdvancedFitness,37h2z6,zissouo,1 point,Wed May 27 19:19:32 2015 UTC,"Hmm that is unfortunate because as someone who loves data I could see so many interesting ways to present it and learn from it. Have you followed the generated workout recommendations? Do they feel like good adjustments? Is it mostly just ""hey you should do 5 reps of 80lbs instead of 3 poor reps of 95lbs"" or what type of recommendations are they?"
AdvancedFitness,37h2z6,zissouo,1 point,Wed May 27 19:24:11 2015 UTC,"No, I only used the ""freestyle"" mode (or whatever it's called), because I was following ICF and didn't want to mess with the program. I'll try it next time I'm at the gym, just to see what it says. Will report back."
AdvancedFitness,37h2z6,neoncheetah,1 point,Wed May 27 19:39:00 2015 UTC,Which metrics would you like to see? What of your progress from workout to workout?

AdvancedFitness,37h2z6,zissouo,1 point,Wed May 27 23:13:32 2015 UTC,"For example, I'd like to compare my performance on bench press from workout to workout. It would be cool if I could see some line charts showing the progress of bench press over time in terms of power/total workload/weight lifted etc.  It's would also be nice if you could tell the app that you don't do the same workout every time. It keeps comparing my total tonnage to the previous workout. When following a program where not every workout is the same (say on an A/B/A pattern) that's not very meaningful. It would be more useful if you could have it compare the previous workout of the same type, like compare the ""A"" workout I'm doing today to the last ""A"" workout."
AdvancedFitness,37h2z6,neoncheetah,1 point,Thu May 28 17:38:04 2015 UTC,Thanks. What about a metric like estimated one rep max that does take in the difference in sets/reps?

AdvancedFitness,37h2z6,three_white_lights,1 point,Thu May 28 00:00:11 2015 UTC,I've got one and have used it for the last part of my last training cycle. It's fun to use and interesting to see the differences in speed between my lifts (I squat and bench faster at a given % then I do with deadlifts).   I'll be using it more in my next training cycle but only to monitor the speed and correlate it with % over time. It's great if you're a bit of a numbers geek for training like I am. It would be good if you could export all the data and use it elsewhere (like excel or whatever) but I haven't really looked into it yet.  I've found it misses the occasional rep or two which is a bit annoying but it's definitely not perfect. Having said that it's a lot cheaper then buying a $2000 tendo unit.
AdvancedFitness,37h2z6,neoncheetah,1 point,Thu May 28 00:57:26 2015 UTC,"Did you do any explosive exercises in your training cycle? If so, was it as accurate with the accelerated reps or is that where it missed some?"
AdvancedFitness,37h2z6,three_white_lights,1 point,Thu May 28 01:04:20 2015 UTC,I'm a powerlifter so about 95% of my training was squat bench and deadlift. I found it missed reps most with sumo deadlifts and board work on the bench (i suspect because the range was so short).
AdvancedFitness,37h2z6,neoncheetah,1 point,Thu May 28 01:07:20 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Thanks.
AdvancedFitness,37h2z6,invadermoody,1 point,Thu May 28 03:36:18 2015 UTC,"I have mine and like it for certain lifts,  squat deads, etc.   Basically my big multi joint movements.  the velocity measurements are what intrigue me for my sub-maximal training. Think 5/3/1 with its focus on rep PRs rather than 1RM.  If I can move 225lbs faster than I did last week, that's progress.  I train by myself a lot, so measuring bar speed can be a bit hard and this helps with that.  My lady friend has her masters in Exercise Science and likes the portal for programming my stuff, but I do think paying extra for that is a bit ridiculous.  As mentioned, it can be tedious to tell the band before starting, but I don't see a way around that and I can't say it's a huge negative for me.   As for missed reps, you can tell it when it has screwed up.  I did this religiously and it ""learned"", so no more missed reps.  The dev team behind it is also consistently pushing updates out.  They've added exercises and also seem to be tweaking ""algorithms"" on a regular basis, so I'd say the support is there."

AdvancedFitness,37eamc,Pejorativez,1 point,Wed May 27 13:37:03 2015 UTC,Did you learn anything that made you doubt IIFYM?
AdvancedFitness,37eamc,skaray,3,Wed May 27 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean by doubt, but IIFYM is simply a framework for weight loss. If you want to lose weight then you need to use less energy than you take in. This is by definition and all IIFYM  is a system for following this definition.  Is IIFYM the end all be all of weightloss? No. Calories are king but everything else can affect it too. If IIFYM was a ladder then say, carb composition meal timing etc, would be like rubber grips on the bottom or a hand rail.  One example off the top of my head is Metabolic Flux Analysis or how 'fast' a metabolic pathway 'runs'. One tenant of flux analysis states that the flux through a pathway is determined by both the demand and the source i.e., to max out a pathway you need to have large demand at the end of the pathway and a large source at the beginning.  So for example if you want to bulk you create the 'demand' of the muscle building pathway by working out and you provide the 'source' by over eating. This is why bulking effectively requires a high calorie intake. While having either the 'demand' step or 'source' step be high will cause the pathway to run, both will cause it to run faster than the sum of the two. This is why recomping is so in-efficient.  IMO a more efficient dieting system is the renaissance diet layout but in the end, what works works and the 'science' (i.e., 'studies' as people only think of science as) doesn't really matter."

My main takeaways since I've had most of the physiology in school and such is that you're going to have to experiment a little. Every athlete is different in terms of what they need to improve on, but as long as you understand the various skill/intensity/general recovery requirements of what you're doing and you eat enough carbs, you should be able to improve both strength and conditioning at the same time. The book gave you a really basic template upon which to experiment. He can't really go into specifics for every imaginable combo just because that would be way too lengthy.  The only thing I wished it would've gone into more is peaking strategies for different sports. As he said, you'll pretty much be underperforming on a hybrid routine right up until you peak for a competition. He just didn't go into those strategies in this iteration of the book."

He spends most of his book talking in reference to a powerlifter-triathlete hybrid, which I didn't like too much, but that's where his expertise is in.

The numbers of people who can pull 700 or run a 4:15 mile are significantly lower than that.

These are ok times, especially for a big guy like Viada. But there is a strong correlation between all endurance times. Even something as short as a mile is an endurance event.

It is a good comparison.  The top decathlete 1500m runners, who are slower than what Alex claims, are about 170 lbs.  There are 220 lb decathletes who run in the 4:20s (<5 min mile), which is awesome.  The important note is that those guys have real measured times while Alex has none."

AdvancedFitness,379vt1,broscientologist,1 point,Tue May 26 03:36:48 2015 UTC,Usually pretty good - sometimes intranasal is preferred over subq because of the proximity to the brain and the fact that it's easier to administer that way.  One interesting example of the potential differences between theseforms of administration is bremelanotan - intranasal causes potentially dangerous increases in blood pressure while sub-q doesn't.

AdvancedFitness,3770n0,Pejorativez,2,Mon May 25 11:56:43 2015 UTC,"This study suggests subjects only need 1/3rd of frequency (3 versus 1 day a week) to maintain muscle size and most of the strength adaptations following a 16 week program.  Note: subjects were untrained before starting RT.   ABSTRACT   Resistance training (RT) is a proven sarcopenia countermeasure with a high degree of potency. However, sustainability remains a major issue that could limit the appeal of RT as a therapeutic approach without well-defined dosing requirements to maintain gains.  PURPOSE: To test the efficacy of two maintenance prescriptions on muscle mass, myofiber size and type distribution, and strength. We hypothesized the minimum dose required to maintain RT-induced adaptations would be greater in the old (60-75 yr) versus young (20-35 yr).  METHODS: Seventy adults participated in a two-phase exercise trial that consisted of RT 3 d·wk for 16 wk (phase 1) followed by a 32-wk period (phase 2) with random assignment to detraining or one of two maintenance prescriptions (reducing the dose to one-third or one-ninth of that during phase 1).  RESULTS: Phase 1 resulted in expected gains in strength, myofiber size, and muscle mass along with the typical IIx-to-IIa shift in myofiber-type distribution. Both maintenance prescriptions preserved phase 1 muscle hypertrophy in the young but not the old. In fact, the one-third maintenance dose led to additional myofiber hypertrophy in the young. In both age groups, detraining reversed the phase 1 IIx-to-IIa myofiber-type shift, whereas a dose response was evident during maintenance training with the one-third dose better maintaining the shift. Strength gained during phase 1 was largely retained throughout detraining with only a slight reduction at the final time point.  CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that older adults require a higher dose of weekly loading than the young to maintain myofiber hypertrophy attained during a progressive RT program, yet gains in specific strength among older adults were well preserved and remained at or above levels of the untrained young."

To quote:   Enhanced muscle performance was also sustained among the old; yet they seem to require more frequent dosing to maintain the muscle mass gains realized from RT."

Can't really justify the claim that we see a decrease in all-cause and then an increase (or much of anything, really).  I haven't read much into these studies but I thought a big issue with some of these analyses is that they controlled for weight, blood pressure, etc.? So maybe if you ran a little but somehow still had perfect weight and blood pressure, running more wouldn't help. But for those where running more would improve weight and blood pressure, it would help and this is not shown in the type of analysis that they did. Relatedly, I'm also wondered if the results in this case would be sort of artificial, in the sense that running more for the typical person has positive and negative correlational effects (but potentially net positive) - but the positive is driven by the variables that were controlled for, so we are only left with the negative. e.g. I think I remember seeing something that people who exercise a lot (>8hrs a week) had high incidence of mental illness.  Not an issue I've studied carefully but just wanted to note some issues. I'm satisfied to just go with the majority of the people whose job it is to research this stuff - which seems to be more running is better."
AdvancedFitness,373py8,ZKnight,1 point,Mon May 25 13:33:44 2015 UTC,"Can't really justify the claim that we see a decrease in all-cause and then an increase    I disagree with the first part, agree with the second part.  The evidence seems pretty clear that if one compares runners vs non-runners there is a decrease in all cause mortality.   According to Table 2 in the Lee paper, being a runner (defined as running >51 min a week) vs a nonrunner (running <51 min a week, more likely 0 min a week) adds 3 years to your expected lifespan.  This point is actually totally fascinating too, in that they control for a bunch of other things like:   baseline age sex smoking status alcohol consumption parental heart disease history body mass index presence or absence of abnormal electrocardiogram hypertension  diabetes hypercholesterolemia other physical activities except running   The last in particular is interesting, as it says if I cycle a ton, I would still get a significant benefit from adding in running.      I think I remember seeing something that people who exercise a lot (>8hrs a week) had high incidence of mental illness.   This is plausible.  What drives one to be a high-milage runner could also drive one to engage in activities that may not be good for long term survival.  If only this were a randomized interventional study.. But as an observational study this is one of the best I've seen.   I'm satisfied to just go with the majority of the people whose job it is to research this stuff - which seems to be more running is better.   I'd disagree with the ""more is better"" answer based on these data.  If we were to break this down to 3 hypotheses for runners:  For all cause mortality:   running a little is about the same as running a lot running a little is worse than running a lot running a little is better than running a lot   These data seem to indicate that hypothesis 1 is the most likely, hypothesis 2 is a little less likely, and hypothesis 3 is the least likely.   Further more, if hypothesis 2 or 3 happened to be true then the effect size is small (at least according to the Lee paper)."
AdvancedFitness,373py8,DrastyRymyng,2,Mon May 25 17:39:47 2015 UTC,"If you take up running don't set your pace based on a paper. It might be right, but that would just be by chance. 8:34-8:00 (7-7.5mph) is too fast for many people, and too slow for many others for ""easy running"" (which is the most usual pace that one's running should be at).   Going further, taking up a sport you don't like, or not training one you love properly because of some studies as unclear as these seems a bit silly (these studies aren't conclusively showing that running will add or take off many years of life). If you love running, train it properly, and build up to running as much as you want (odds are you'll be well short of the high mileage that professionals run). If you hate it, why waste your time doing it? If you're somewhere in between, run occasionally. You do other exercise, and while possible, it seems unlikely that running would provide tons of benefits that other aerobic exercise, particularly somewhat-intense cycling, would provide."
AdvancedFitness,373py8,DrastyRymyng,1 point,Mon May 25 14:57:55 2015 UTC,"So this is an interesting question.  Is there a something special about running?  Or would I be equally well off cycling, rowing, lifting, swimming, or the like?  I ask this because in the Lee paper they explicitly account for ""other physical activity"" in model 2 and 3.  They describe the measure as follows:   Total amount of other physical activities except running (cycling, swimming, walking, basketball, racquet sports, aerobic dance, and other sports-related activities) was classified into 3 groups: 0, 1 to 499, and $500 MET- minutes per week based on the Physical Activity Guidelines (3). To reduce confounding bias in the association between running and mortality, the total amount of other physical activities except running was adjusted in all multivariable regression models.    So even after accounting for this other physical activity, they still find a significant benefit to running for reducing all cause mortality (+3.0 years average added to life). The benefit is almost as large as not having diabetes (+4.2 years), not having a parent who had heart issues (+2.5 years), or not being overweight (+2.0 years).    I totally agree with you about liking it or not--we tend not to stick with habits that we don't enjoy.   I actually love running, but have fallen away from it due to concerns about my knee and just plain lack of time.  So for me it is a question of is it worth putting the cognitive investment into retraining a new knee-safe stride and carving out the time to run or not?"
AdvancedFitness,373py8,sulandra,1 point,Mon May 25 17:57:54 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting question.  I think running is different from the other exercises in two respects: 1) it must be done at a relatively high minimum intensity (unlike walking, cycling, rowing, lifting, or swimming), and 2) it it steady-state aerobic exercise (unlike basketball, racquet sports, and lifting). To illustrate the first point, it seems likely that some people who swim just go and do relaxing laps. I don't think the the authors controlled for how hard people swim, just how long they swim. It sounds like they just say ""swimming for m minutes = X MET minutes"" using the guidelines in (3).  For your knees, some things I've found helpful are focusing on cadence (180+), and addressing muscle weakness/imbalances through lifting heavy weights with compound movements (in other words squat and deadlift). Also weight loss. Focusing on midfoot striking or changing your whole stride at once (instead of little cues like cadence or ""lean forward a little"") is a great way to hurt yourself IMO. A doctor or PT is of course the best resource for knee pain, but the people at /r/AdvancedRunning and /r/running often have good things to say too."

You can maintain, as the next workout will.. generally.. interrupt the return adaptation that time brings.  If you worked up to something greater, and then work down to another level, you'll maintain for a bit and then adjust down to the new level.

Example: You can bench a difficult 3x10x150lbs. If you were to do that 3 times a week for an extended period of time it would gradually become easier but the easier it comes, the less adapation you are inducing by doing it.

AdvancedFitness,36zxy6,Robberbaron212,11,Sat May 23 15:58:44 2015 UTC,"What you call stretching and strengthening the ""opposing muscle group"" is just a partial solution. Once you have developed the physical capability to achieve the desired positions, you have to then train your endurance in those positions. This means exercises that put you under tension in those positions. For instance front squats, OHP, running, rows, they all train posture to some degree when performed correctly. I don't mean to say that these are how people train or should train posture necessarily, but once the position is attainable, it's about endurance and forming a new habit.   Do you slouch when you are exercising at the gym? Quit it! If not, then you just need to hire someone to hit you with a stick whenever you slouch. Hehe.   I realize that this isn't the scientific answer that you requested, and I'll leave that you others.

I really thought about this on my own, as when I took off time from ALL training one winter, I felt my posture was better and I was standing taller, more straight  It's almost as if most weight lifting, if not all, for someone WITH ATP, could result in worsening ATP -- I say this because people who have ATP may still recruit 'ATP' style when doing most movements, i.e. Even the KB Swing, even me performing it with perform form(or as a perfect movement), still recruits my lower back, traps, etc. I'm even debating whether or not a movement like that recruits some over-strengthened muscles in the hip -- I have no info on this, but just from where I 'feel it' when doing high rep swings  I know McGill is a genius, I've read a few of his articles and have heard many experts I respect talk about how good he is, but I do think he's more focused on back pain etc, something that luckily, I don't seem to have a problem with"

Front squats do strengthen the quads, but the point is that we should be able to stabilize throughout the movement, staying out or apt. If you can't stay our of apt in that exercise, maybe a descended form is better. Or possibly, if apt is the primary concern, train ppt with something like American deadlift or OHP with good strong butt clench at the top.   The reason I mention McGill is because the lowback really is the base for good posture, pain or not, and his books are the best description of assessment and scientific treatment of the area that I know of. Apt is definitely a ""low back disorber"" in a sense. It is a very involved read, though."
AdvancedFitness,36zxy6,phrakture,1 point,Sat May 23 17:37:01 2015 UTC,"You're getting too caught up in strengthening the ""weak/long"" muscles and avoiding working the ""short/strong"" muscles. You don't have to avoid all work for the ""short/strong"" groups, and I'd even suggest doing so to be counter-productive.  The main goal of strength training to improve posture is to facilitate your habitual practice of good posture. So having a base level of strength and muscular endurance in postural muscles is key, but so is having recruitment patterns that provide that balanced, stable posture. Basically most posture comes from co-contractions of muscles, rather than each in isolation, which is an argument for why you shouldn't train them in isolation either.  So have a slight bias towards the ""weak/long"" muscles, but not a complete dearth of their antagonists."

AdvancedFitness,36zxy6,stilloriginal,2,Sun May 24 08:09:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I consider yoga more dynamic stretching because Yes you may use the same stretches sometimes... But if you do it in sequences, when your muscles are warm, it's more effective. Yoga is also very powerful in using your breathing muscles (Thoracic, diaphragm, etc)  to allow relaxation of all muscles. Have you ever thought about slow breathing while in a really good posture during any exercise that emphasizes posture? It's extremely difficult. But with practice, you realize that breathing is one of the most important exercises. If you can relax during an exercise, you've mastered it and thus it is a true endurance (but static) exercise.   For Example, look up Cresent pose. Staying in this position for several minutes is very challenging. Actually, in yoga, exercises aren't measured in minutes, but in breaths, so a goal would be to see if you can have at about 10 breaths spread over 3-5 minutes an example. At anytime you're holding your breath or notice its rate increases, then, well you've got more practicing to do. But notice how open the chest is and how the hips are challenged in this exercise.   This is just an example of one type of yoga, a simple hatha yoga pose. You can continue to find yoga sequences like a vinyasa, (or power yoga) that combines several poses like this into 3-5 minutes which is more of  a cardio workout, but the breathing rules STILL applies, it has to be slow and be ready for the next pose.  My favorite type of yoga, as well as my chiro 's is anusura yoga. It's more focused on body alignment.   As a runner, I've been stretching the typical runner's stretches for 10 plus years. It helped some but it never made me ""flexible"". With yoga, I feel more mobile and can get into runners stretches that I couldn't get into before."

AdvancedFitness,36zxy6,goatchop41,4,Sat May 23 17:16:24 2015 UTC,"We had several issues that we were addressing:   forward head posture measured by deflection from optimum, and absence of curviture right shoulder range of motion issues caused by accumulated scaring after FOOSH and extended computer usage several other issues that were assessed but due to limited time and funds not addressed: APT, partially detached glut medius.   The traction we did basically looked like this Cervical correction, actually more specifically D and F  Traction in my case is best explained as ""force, time, and displacement"".  I spent several years (time) in progressively (force) bad posture (displacement).  So we needed to use an aggressive position (displacement) with higher progression or pull (force) to correct on a shorter scale (time).  I found it quite effective.  I would have a very hard time suggesting that you do traction on yourself on your own--especially for the neck.  I stress that you should do this with the assistance and guidance of a decent and trained professional.  Self traction on your hip and knee might be okay.  I've personally done some self-traction on my hip--but that also caused aggravated sciatica for several weeks.  I was correcting issues with a stuck sacrum (search ""IS joint dysfunction"").

That's because there isn't any evidence for that form of traction. The first link is just a full page sales pitch. Also, it is a falsehood that you can gave 'misalignments' of the spine that can be detected via xray and 'corrected'. If one of your vertebral facet joints (the little ones on the sides of each vertebrae) was 'out of place', like chiros tell you that they are, you would probably have a damaged spinal cord too. I'm not saying that you didn't get better. What I'm saying is that it may have been the placebo effect, from another aspect of treatment (not the traction), or just natural progression  Edit: if you disagree with my critique of that chiropractic treatment, say why.

But here is the TL;DR for the lazy:  11β-HSD1 is an enzyme used by the body to regulate and convert cortisone to cortisol.     RESULTS: Skeletal muscle 11β-HSD1 expression was increased 2.72-fold in women over 60 years of age compared to those aged 20-40 years; no differences were observed in men. There was a significant positive correlation between skeletal muscle 11β-HSD1 expression and age in women across the group (rho = 0.40; P = .009). No differences in expression of 11β-HSD type 2, glucocorticoid receptor, or hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase between age groups were observed in either sex. Urinary steroid markers of 11β-HSD1, 11β-HSD type 2, or 5α-reductase were similar between age groups. Skeletal muscle 11β-HSD1 expression was associated with reduced grip strength in both sexes and correlated positively with percentage of body fat, homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance, total cholesterol, LH, and FSH and negatively with bone mineral content and IGF-1 in women  CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle 11β-HSD1 is up-regulated with age in women and is associated with reduced grip strength, insulin resistance, and an adverse body composition profile. Selective inhibition of 11β-HSD1 may offer a novel strategy to prevent and/or reverse age-related sarcopenia.   Preliminary results indicate that men do, in fact, age more gracefully than women."

AdvancedFitness,36fxzu,Catholic_Spray,5,Tue May 19 11:47:29 2015 UTC,"Umm, I don't think that means you cannot induce hypertrophy of the fast twitch fibers... please read this article from 23andMe about the ACTN3 gene:   Lacking the ACTN3 protein does not seem to have any harmful health effects, but there does seem to be an effect on sports performance. Several studies have found that Olympic-level power athletes always have at least one working copy of the ACTN3 gene. After studying hundreds of athletes, scientists came to the conclusion that it is probably impossible for someone who lacks the ACTN3 protein to reach the top levels of performance in power sports.  They were soon proven wrong. While looking for other genes that might determine athletic ability, a Spanish scientist hit upon an exception to the rule: a champion long jumper who has two non-working copies of ACTN3.  The long jumper has a history of great achievement. He competed at the international level at the age of 16, and went on to compete in several European and World championships. He has also participated in two Olympic games.  The fact that this long jumper is the first and so far only Olympic power athlete to be found who lacks the ""gene for speed"" is evidence for how important this gene is in determining this type of athletic ability. But his success is a testament to the fact that genes are not destiny.   In other words, stop overthinking it, lift heavy, and lift often."

High rep training is not the way to go to gain muscle. Yes, that link shows it's possible, but you aren't an experienced lifter (or at least it doesn't sound like it). High rep programs will probably be more unpleasant and less effective than doing a low-rep program like 5x5 or SS. Do that and eat a lot. You'll gain weight.  Also, your lactate threshold is something that changes with training. You're not gonna go out and kill a 10k (which requires a high LT) because of genes. Genes help, but without training they are worthless.  Finally, unless you get a muscle biopsy, you have no idea what proportion of your muscle fibers are fast/slow twitch. I think this also varies between muscles too. In the end though, it doesn't matter. Do what you can with what you have since that's all you'll get.

AdvancedFitness,36evr0,Pejorativez,11,Mon May 18 21:09:07 2015 UTC,"There's been a few studies on antioxidants and aerobic adaptation with mixed results. Personally I think there's not enough evidence to conclusively say that antioxidants prevent adaptation to training, a lot of studies have shown decreased gene expression responses to acute exercise but that doesn't always equate to a training effect, and training studies have shown no difference.   In this study, the two groups have VO2maxs of 56-58, so they're fit but they aren't exactly athletes, that's probably on the upper end of what a normal healthy person in their age range should be. The differences they report are +5.6% in the group with the 58 average, so thats +~2-3ml/kg/min. Given how they determined their VO2max's and only did single pre- and post-testing, that could definitely just be normal variation that they didn't see in the other group on antioxidants. Their criteria for VO2max was a respiratory exchange ratio >1.1 and inability to run further. As far as I'm concerned, those 2 criteria are not a valid reference for a VO2max. Max is shown by a plateau in oxygen consumption despite an increase in workload. Because that's really hard to do, there are secondary criterai which include RER >1.1, voluntary exhaustion, heart rate within 10 bpm of age predicted max and blood lactate >8mmol. But those still don't indicate a participant has reached true max. So I would take this finding with a grain of salt as I think there are reasonable explanations for the difference other than the antioxidants alone...

But it's still a contentious topic, and muscle adaptation responds to multiple stimuli and is so full of inbuilt redundancies that I find it hard to believe taking out one signal completely prevents adaptation.  At it's most basic level, the idea is that muscle adapts to being put under stress, antioxidants remove that stress and so the muscle doesn't adapt."

The supplement used in this study contained several antioxidant compounds with vitamin C and E and carotenoids as the main constituents.  Conclusion  The main finding in this study was that administration of an antioxidant supplement over six weeks reduced the efficiency of endurance training in well-trained athletes. Supplementation increased antioxidant capacity, as indicated by an increase in skin caretenoid score, but blocked the increase in VO2 max that was observed in the placebo group. Consequently, our results support the idea that ingesting large amounts of antioxidants through supplements may reduce some of the training induced adaptations in factors important for aerobic power.  Perspectives  Our findings [...] suggest that athletes in general should be restrictive when it comes to ingesting supplements containing large amounts of effective  antioxidants in their  normal training routines. We do, however, believe  that all athletes should optimize their normal diet with a great variety of foods offering a good balance of all nutrients, including antioxidants. It is also important to note that our finding has to be repeated in other studies before final conclusions can be drawn."

AdvancedFitness,35yh98,to_say_the_i,3,Fri May 15 00:04:27 2015 UTC,"To me it seems to indicate that, like pretty much everything in life, a good balance is the most effective, rather than raising any single element to a more extreme level.   The salient point, for those who didn't read through the study:   The significant negative correlation between protein and resting T concentrations is consistent with the findings of Anderson et al. (2), who demonstrated that a low-protein diet (10% of total energy) was associated with higher levels of T compared with a diet higher in protein (44% of total energy).    Interesting that they specifically say that a low-protein diet is significantly better for raising testosterone levels than a high protein diet.    By the way, it also seems that the percentage of fat has nothing to do with it. See this:   Raben et al. (24) reported a significant decrease in resting T concentrations and an attenuation in the exercise-induced increase in T in male endurance athletes who switched from a meat-rich diet to a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet. Interestingly, both diets contained equal amounts of energy derived from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, indicating that the supply of energy from the different macronutrients was not responsible for the effect on T and that the composition of carbohydrate, protein, and fat may influence T concentrations.   As I've always said (to hefty down-votes in fitness forums) the type of foods you eat is, in several ways, more important than their macro makeup. Take that, IIFYM broscience!"
AdvancedFitness,35yh98,Doc_Nag_Idea_Man,2,Fri May 15 15:33:51 2015 UTC,"Well we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that testosterone isn't the only hormone influencing anabolism.

AdvancedFitness,35yh98,dreiter,-5,Fri May 15 19:22:31 2015 UTC,"Yes and more animal protein correlated with less T, but more plant protein correlated with more T.   The significant negative correlation between protein and resting T concentrations is consistent with the findings of Anderson et al. (2), who demonstrated that a low-protein diet (10% of total energy) was associated with higher levels of T compared with a diet higher in protein (44% of total energy). The authors postulated that it was the protein-to-carbohydrate ratio in the diet that influenced either T metabolism or the liver-derived protein sex hormone-binding globulin (2,14). Interestingly, the protein-to-carbohydrate ratio in the present study was significantly negatively correlated with resting T concentrations. Also, the source from which the protein is derived may influence T concentrations. Raben et al. (24) compared the effects of two diets differing only in the source of protein in male athletes. Results showed a reduced resting and postexercise increase in T concentrations in athletes consuming protein derived mainly from vegetable sources compared with a diet with protein derived mainly from animal sources. Thus not only the percent energy derived from protein in the diet but also the source of protein may influence T homeostasis."

In practice, usually taken as the best of three efforts in a single test session."" Low-intensity strength training (LISTR) Classical strength training aka high intensity training (CST)   Abstract   The effects of [LISTR] on the force–velocity properties of hip and knee extensor muscles, the power endurance of the knee extensor muscles, and the aerobic performance of the body were studied. The difference between the LISTR and [CST] is that the working muscle groups do not relax at the extreme points of the range of motion. The study was per- formed in two groups each comprising nine young physically active men who trained three times a week for eight weeks. The study showed that LISTR increased the maximum voluntary force to about the same extent as CST, but this was achieved with lower training loads. Moreover, LISTR did not lead to a decrease in the local muscular work capacity, which is usually observed during CST.   Other highlights   The total work performed in development training exercises during the eight-week training cycle in the control group was 1.9 times as great as that in the experimental group.  As compared to the LISTR, the CST led to a greater increment in the MVF measured using the 1RM method. However, to analyze the effectiveness of different methods of strength training, it seems more reasonable to use increments relative to the performance of training exercises rather than absolute increments in muscular strength. In the experimental group, the absolute increments in the MVF relative to the total work performed during the whole training cycle exceeded those in the control group by 22.5%. In other words, LISTR made it possible to increase the muscle strength with lower training loads."

A practical application of this would be to do both high and medium intensity training to maximize hypertrophy in both fibre types   [strength] gains in the leg press 1 RM over 8 weeks in the [high intensity] group and [medium intensity] group were 34% and 30%, respectively, i.e., no differences between the groups were recorded  in the group that trained with middle intensity without relaxation, an increase (18.1 ± 6.9%) was found in the area occupied by type I muscle fibers [...], and no increase was found in the area occupied by type II muscle fibers [...] In contrast, in the group that used traditional strength training, there was an increase in the area occupied by type II muscle fibers (by 33.0 ± 5.1%), and no changes were found in the area occupied by type I muscle fibers. Thus, training without relaxation with an intensity of about 65–70% of 1 RM can increase the strength to the same extent as traditional high intensity strength training   Source"

Scenario B - I shoot 100 freethrows every single day Monday thru Sunday for four weeks. On the fifth Monday, I enter a freethrow shooting competition.   I would argue that Scenario B would give you better performance for the competition, and better performance throughout the entire training as well! Not to mention, in Scenario A I shot 4,000 freethrows and in Scenario B I shot 2,800 freethrows!  TL;DR - Lifting is a skill learned by the CNS. It's not just muscular-based.

The study also shows no benefit from eating fruits and vegetables, when these have been confirmed as healthful foods in pretty much every study, ever.   Also, they didn't seem to care about drug interactions with the fish oil pills when everyone knows that medications for cardiovascular issues are contraindicated for fish oil.   The study also notes that no one showed any ill effects during the first phase. It wasn't until they took a year's break and came back to it that there were issues.

AdvancedFitness,35hqh4,Pejorativez,2,Mon May 11 13:24:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't know about the Shuenke study, so that's neat. For whatever reason, the authors of your linked article and Schoenfeld seem content to draw definitive conclusions based off of data that didn't come anywhere close to significance, and therefore can't be said to not be due to random chance. I don't get it. In the Mitchell study, there were no significant differences in fiber type growth. In the Campos study, there wasn't even significant muscle growth in the 20-28 rep group.   You can't just interpret statistics however you like to fit a preconceived notion. There's a reason we use them instead of just relying on human intuition. Shit makes me mad. Trending towards significance is not significance."
AdvancedFitness,35hqh4,Strikerrjones,2,Mon May 11 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"The good thing about sites that aggregate studies like this is that they're like an archive that you can dig into even if you disagree with their meta-analysis.  Regarding the studies, are you talking about this quote?:   as Ogborn and Schoenfeld (2014) have explained, type I muscle fibers can also be developed in order to maximize the overall increase in size of a muscle. Moreover, there are some very preliminary indications from some (Campos et al. 2002; Mitchell et al. 2012) but not all (Schuenke et al. 2012) studies that training with higher repetitions and low loads in order to target type I muscle fibers may lead to preferential growth of these fibers (see review by Ogborn and Schoenfeld, 2014)."
AdvancedFitness,35hqh4,Pejorativez,2,Mon May 11 14:35:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely a good resource. And yep, that part and where they go into it a bit further on but completely fail to mention none of the type I fiber results in those studies met significance.  There are apparently some Russian studies confirming the idea (particularly this one), but I've only ever seen Brad Schoenfeld reference them, and as far as I can tell the full texts don't actually exist on the internet. He's probably friends with the Russian authors or something. Either that, or he's just including them based on what he read in the abstract. Hopefully it isn't that second option."
AdvancedFitness,35hqh4,Strikerrjones,3,Mon May 11 14:50:34 2015 UTC,I found some of the russian studies on researchgate but I dunno which ones you're after. Some of the conclusions I've seen so far are: Type 1 grows alongside type II because it is recruited before type II in any movement. Even in low rep high intensity environments.  But some of the research findings were inconsistent  Most of these are available for free too:  0  1  2  3  4  Alexey Netreba seems to be involved in many of these

AdvancedFitness,35hqh4,Pejorativez,1 point,Tue May 12 13:19:48 2015 UTC,"So, in the knee extensor study, it looks like the low load group was work-matched to the high load group, which means they likely only did about half the number of repetitions per set they were capable of versus the high load group going to failure with every set. No shit the type II fibers didn't experience much hypertrophy, they were probably barely even recruited."
AdvancedFitness,35hqh4,Strikerrjones,2,Mon May 11 18:05:50 2015 UTC,"They don't explicitly state how many reps the experimental group was doing, but later in the article they state that:   In the LE group, the increase in the strength was smaller than in the group that trained with a high intensity, which could be due to lower intensity and volume of the work performed.    However, there were 3 different series: L, K, and M.  In the L-series the control group performed 6-12 reps on 7 sets 80-85% 1RM to exhaustion with 50/50 time under tension vs relaxation.  The experimental group performed 4 supersets for 3 sets (12 sets) with a training movement that was 3.5 times as slow, so they had continuous muscle tension. 50% 1RM  K-series was identical to L-series.  In the M-series, the experimental group went for medium-intensity.   We assume that, during training with incomplete relaxation, a slight increase in the intensity [...] and an increase in the work performed during a training session (to the levels of traditional strength  training) could provide an increase in strength comparable to their increase during traditional high intensity strength training  [...]the workload for the [M-series experimental] group was increased in comparison to the series described previously [L and K series] due to the greater intensity of exercising (65–70% vs. 50% of 1 RM in the previous experiment), and an increase in the number of sets. This allowed us to equalize the total amount of training performed by the MC group and the ME group. In addition, the duration of the rest periods in this group was reduced from 10 min to 5 min.    They concluded:   [strength] gains in the leg press 1 RM over 8 weeks in the MC group and ME groups were 34% and 30%, respectively, i.e., no differences between the groups were recorded  in the group that trained with middle intensity without relaxation, an increase (18.1  ±  6.9%) was found in the area occupied by type I muscle fibers [...], and no increase was found in the area occupied by type II muscle fibers [...] In contrast, in the group that used traditional strength training, there was an increase in the area occupied by type II muscle fibers (by 33.0  ± 5.1%), and no changes were found in the area occupied by type I muscle fibers. Thus, training without relaxation with an intensity of about 65–70% of 1 RM can increase the strength to the same extent as traditional high intensity strength training   So in summary, if we disregard L-group:   Strength: M-series show us that with matching volume you get a similar strength increase in high and medium intensity groups.  Hypertrophy: You get Type I fiber growth, but no type II growth, in ME group. You get Type II growth, but no Type I growth, in MC (high intensity) group. Practical application: incorporate high intensity and medium intensity into training regiment to get maximal stimulation of both fibre types. At least that's what Layne Norton has been preaching for a long time. Personally I thought Type 1 would also grow in high intensity training since it is recruited before type II, but that may be wrong   Edit: this seems to confirm the Schoenfeld quote you were talking about earlier:    [...] Emerging research out of Russia indicates that [...] light loads promote greater gains in type I fibers while heavy loads increase type II fiber hypertrophy [...]"
AdvancedFitness,35hqh4,Pejorativez,2,Tue May 12 13:19:04 2015 UTC,"So, I'm having trouble making sense of the strength increases relative to the loads lifted because it doesn't really match the same pattern that nearly all of the other available literature shows. I can't think of a single other study in which the high load group experienced the same strength gains as a low load group. Most other studies with a middle intensity group also show greater strength gains with the high intensity group, although they usually don't do the weird super slow constant tension thing. It could have something to do with all the different velocities... maybe the strength gains in this study were more specific to the velocities they trained at? I think it's just too many variables all crammed together to really draw a decent conclusion about the strength gains, especially since they contradict literally all the other literature I've found.  As for the hypertrophy... here's the graph.  What I'm having issues with here is that the MI and HI groups both had their results reach significance, but the LI group didn't reach significance with hypertrophy, even though the effect looks to be much greater in type I than the other two groups and the standard deviation doesn't look any bigger. How is that even possible? Something screwy is going on with the statistics and interpretation there, and I can't figure out what.   If anything, I think the non-significant results mirror that of the Campos study (I think it was the 4th study you linked) in that there was a trend towards type I hypertrophy in the 20-28 rep group, but none of the hypertrophy reached significance. It's probably quite difficult to get people to actually do 20-28 reps to failure (and these are both untrained populations in the studies), so maybe stopping short of failure (purposefully in the Russian study and accidentally in the Campos study) during a high rep set only recruits and stimulates minor hypertrophy in type I fibers. That makes sense with the size principle too. Maybe with much larger groups we could tease out the subtle effects here."
AdvancedFitness,35hqh4,Strikerrjones,2,Thu May 14 14:41:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's just too many variables all crammed together to really draw a decent conclusion about the strength gains, especially since they contradict literally all the other literature I've found.   I agree. These Russians seem obsessed with maximizing time under tension, but the idea that good strength gains can come from low-intensity/low-effort training is seen in another Russian study."

AdvancedFitness,35hqh4,Strikerrjones,1 point,Thu May 14 14:16:35 2015 UTC,Is there a conclusion as to what the optimal number of sets per muscle group would be? Obviously it changes person to person and whether or not the lifter is enhanced.
AdvancedFitness,35hqh4,d1ez3,6,Mon May 11 17:05:56 2015 UTC,"This study of Brad's doesn't indicate the optimum volume for hypertrophy, though two of his 2015 studies showed that for quads, hams, back and chest, 9 sets each of 8-12 reps to failure with 90 seconds rest between sets was sufficient to cause significant strength and hypertrophy increases in experienced lifters, whether that was delivered in one session or split across three.  And without doing specific arm work the back and chest work hypertrophied their arms.   There are a couple of papers I know of that examine the question of volume which you might find useful to read.   Brad co-authored a study with Eric Helms and Alan Aragon in 2014 called Recommendations for Natural Bodybuilding Contest Preparation: Resistance and Cardiovascular Training in which he recommended 40-70 reps, mostly in the 6-12 rep range, twice weekly.  This was based on a review of the body of studies looking at volume. He noted that experienced body builders may eventually require even more volume than this.   Also noteworthy is the 2011 Marshall study called Strength and neuromuscular adaptation following one, four, and eight sets of high intensity resistance exercise in trained males.  They used 80% 1RM squats twice weekly to failure and the group performing 8 sets gained the most strength.   Finally, there is the James Krieger 2010 meta analysis, Single vs. multiple sets of resistance exercise for muscle hypertrophy, in which 1, 2-3 and 4-6 sets were compared.  Note that the studies included both experienced and inexperienced lifters. James highlighted greater hypertrophy results with more volume but with diminishing returns after the first set, e.g., the second set produced about 40% of the gains of the first set."

His subjects performed an explosive but controlled concentric and a two second eccentric. I'm not sure about the other studies."
AdvancedFitness,35hqh4,_Omar_,1 point,Tue May 12 15:11:42 2015 UTC,"I am beginning to become convinced that when it comes to general hypertrophy, a reasonable rule of thumb is: What matters most is the number of sets taken to near failure."

Both groups gained similar hypertrophy. In this one he compared moderate to high reps to failure but instead of equating volume he equated sets. Again both groups gained similar hypertrophy.  In other studies comparing sets of squats, up to 8, the groups performing more sets gained more strength. I don't know if they looked at hypertrophy. In James Krieger's meta analysis he found that more sets were also better.  All of this data may be what Jbuberal is thinking about."
AdvancedFitness,35hqh4,_Omar_,2,Sun May 10 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"To make things more complicated, they should do a study with the same amount of volume & TUT, but have one group do 3x10 and the other do 6x5 but with the same weight, just half the rest period between sets."

I don't have a long list of references on hand, but it does seem that in the last few years evidence has been accumulating that when it comes to hypertrophy, volume is the predominant predictor. This seems to correlate to many of the anecdotal statements made by bodybuilders too.  As others have pointed out however, there are many ways to measure volume:   sets X reps X weight sets X reps sets   My completely unfounded pseudo-claim is that when take to near failure, the third form (just the number of sets) will correlate most strongly with hypertrophy within some reasonable bounds.  YMMV. I could be wrong. Take with grains of salt."

The Navy, facing criticism over its very simple waist and neck approach to BF, did a study using various methods including submersion.   What they found was basically that their method isn't very accurate, but neither are the higher tech and higher cost methods. Most of the electrical impedance tests are a lot worse.   Even dxa has a surprisingly large standard error and in some cases is not even close.  So whether these are more or less accurate is very difficult to say. According to the Navy study there's certainly not a significant drawback to waist and neck vs anything else you could do at home or at a gym. People just trust it less because it's low tech."

AdvancedFitness,35b16n,eaglessoar,1 point,Fri May 8 23:41:47 2015 UTC,Waist & neck will probably be most beneficial for tracking over the long term. For instance I'm the same bodyweight now as 6 months ago but I've lost an inch off my waist. My actual change in body fat % is probably less than the margin of error of DEXA scans but the waist measurement is a clear indication I'm leaner now.

AdvancedFitness,35a5p6,Ballaticianaire,2,Fri May 8 12:57:18 2015 UTC,"Incredibly doubtful. The rise in GH from fasting, exercise, and so on, is hardly robust enough to be anabolic (or strinkingly anti-catabolic) in skeletal muscle tissue. Besides, LISS provides a massive rise in GH as well, so that necessitates it can't explain it.

This isnt just for the heavy lifters out there as livet/muscle glycogen replenishment is vital for endurance athletes. Even if you do get a boost in HGH post exercise, it only has a half life of about 20min in the blood and you get FAR more via your natural circadian rhythms (which is affected by exercise) than you do during/immediately after a workout. Plus, eating in that 'anabolic window' (again, shit term) has huge benefits for IGF-1 secretion, which is going to in turn ramp up GH from the pituitary."

A year or so later it started hurting again so I picked up this book.   It goes over the anatomy of the muscles that make up your rotator cuff, and gives an example of how to isolate/activate each one, citing multiple studies showing the activation.   A workout program is administered using these exercises, there are 4 in total, and the author recommends 3 days a week, one set, 10-20 reps, progressive overload style (though deloads aren't discussed). The author discusses the studies he bases all of these numbers off of. I do these exercises with 3-15lbs depending on how strong my shoulders are (they are all isolation).  More studies are discussed regarding flexibility, and suggested healthy range of motions are provided with a 5(?) stretch regimen is given, done on the not strength training days.  Finally, there is some proprioception stuff, (this is the third pillar of a bulletproof shoulder, after strength and mobility) but I honestly don't do it. 100% because it sounds boring.  My shoulder hasn't had problems since I picked this up, about 1.5 years now. I do the strength training around 3 times a week to warm up my shoulders before any arm day. I'd totally recommend it and you'll learn arm anatomy pretty well. Also there is a chapter or two about scientific articles and how he actually reads them and filters out bullshit and what makes a good study.

They used quite large doses of protein in this one.  So in answer to your question: it plays a role, but just pushing insulin as high as you can does not necessarily have a linear relationship with muscle protein synthesis (and i'm just gonna extrapolate this to longer term muscle growth - although I am aware this can be disingenuous). Additionally, it plays a small role in synergism with many other hormones. Amino acids also cause a rise in insulin and this can hit the ceiling of insulin secretion required for maximal protein synthesis in the muscle."

These studies demonstrate that adding carbohydrate to a protein dose that alone is known to maximally stimulate protein synthesis (20-25 g of high-quality protein rich in leucine) has no additive or synergic effect on muscle protein synthesis and breakdown. The same result has recently also been demonstrated in older subjects [19]. Converging with those data, the addition of 30 g or 90 g of carbohydrates to 20 g of essential amino acids produces the same effect on protein synthesis and protein breakdown, regardless the great difference in insulinemia in both groups [20]. Insulin seems to only further increase protein synthesis at pharmacological doses [21], which means that it is not achievable by carbohydrate supplementation."

If you don't have calories and protein in line than meal timing wont really matter at all.  But, if you do, and you're at an intermediate to advanced level it does matter.  One thing that's important is eating optimally for the muscle protein synthesis refractory period, which is about three hours.  Coming out of the gym MPS will be elevated, and while it probably doesn't matter for that meal whether or not you eat 30 minutes after the gym or an hour or two, one thing to keep in mind is that you wont be able to spike MPS again until 3+ hours after that initial meal.  So, if you get out of the gym at 7pm and eat at 8pm it wont really make sense to have another protein rich meal until around 11pm.  So meal timing doesn't really matter that much, but focusing on it can help you get as many MPS spikes as possible.

AdvancedFitness,34j5p8,LoudCommentor,5,Fri May 1 16:27:53 2015 UTC,"Read all three parts. Could swipe left on mobile for them.   You never defined what overshoot was... I'm assuming something like, ""The improvement over a tapering period despite less training"".  They're kind of interesting results, because the pro athletes improved pretty significantly in their tapering period. It wasn't said if they were training squat jumps before though, so could really be attributed to a lack of squat jumping training in general.  More importantly they probably wouldn't have done squat jumps with dumbbells, especially with 100% bodyweight. Their shoulders would have been destroyed. They wouldn't used vests in the interest of safety. The picture you have is misleading. Perhaps it was the most clean picture you could  find, but it's on your conscience if someone likes the idea and injures themselves."

AdvancedFitness,34bvuq,prpsc,3,Wed Apr 29 22:25:54 2015 UTC,"I'm far from an expert, so maybe wait for someone with more knowledge to chime in but I have a basic understanding that might help.  A glucose tolerance test typically has a measurement at fasting and at 2 hours after glucose administration to detect diabetes. At this point the blood glucose measurement does not have to reach all the way to baseline to indicate normal glucose clearance. If the issue is reactive hypoglycemia, which is what you're asking about, then a doc may order a glucose tolerance test for up to 6 hours in duration.  There's not really a consensus as far as I know regarding what exactly causes reactive hypoglycemia but it's not always insulin related per se. It probably has more to do with other hormone interaction like the cortiscosteroids and glucagon in many cases.  With insulin, there is an initial 'burst' release from the pancreas, followed by a more steady release. In some cases of reactive hypoglycemia, you could theoretically have a issue where the initial release does not occur properly, resulting in a scenario of hyperglycemia and a subsequent over-reaction to correct this, causing reactive hypoglycemia.  So to answer your question more specifically, it's probably different mechanisms at play if you're experiencing hypoglycemia at different postprandial intervals."
AdvancedFitness,34bvuq,zoogwah,2,Thu Apr 30 02:12:10 2015 UTC,feeling tired is a result of REACTIVE HYPOGLYCEMIA not a normal response.
AdvancedFitness,34bvuq,Furthur,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"Idk how applicable this is in a case where subjects are becoming hypoglycemic (presumably causing the fatigue). If the hypoglycemia is caused by excess insulin being produced to handle the large glucose load, then would a delayed fatigue response mean glucose was being handled better for longer before the body was overwhelmed and excess insulin had to be manufactured.   Normal people shouldn't experience hypoglycemia.   Or does a quick fatigue response mean the initial large insulin response caused the sensitized cells to take up too much glucose.   That generally might indicate having eaten too much."
AdvancedFitness,34bvuq,Insamity,3,Thu Apr 30 17:07:10 2015 UTC,"Low resistance (healthy) is from not eating carbs regularly. If you spike bgl the insulin response would cause bgl to plummet, then return to normal shortly after.  Resistance (prediabetic) would need massive amounts of insulin to cause an uptake of glucose, which would take longer and results in elevated bgl levels long after carb intake. Hence fasting, post carb intake and another after that when testing for diabetes.   Type one diabetes is no insulin and constantly elevated bgl, insulin is supplemented because unlike type 2 which is delayed or reduced affect, type one is essentially 0 insulin response."

AdvancedFitness,34bvuq,Cthulu2013,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:32:55 2015 UTC,"Short answer is that it's complicated and a complete picture is still being formed by the research community. There are a number of factors that likely contribute, such as: 1) high dietary fat leads to high circulating triglycerides, which contribute to storage of fat in skeletal muscle, which suppresses insulin-mediated glucose transport (insulin sensitivity) in muscle; 2) ""high fat"" diets (both experimentally and in reality at least in USA) are synonymous with ""high bad fat"" meaning low in omega-3 and high in palmitic acid and linoleic acid; these fats specifically induce pathophysiology of inflammation and insulin resistance; 3) similar to (1) there is known effect of circulating lipid on the metabolic state of the liver, increasing gluconeogenesis and inhibiting insulin receptor signalling. You sort of alluded to this - yes, high fat causes gluconeogenesis, and it also suppresses glycogen synthesis and insulin uptake.    recent-ish review: http://libgen.org/scimag/get.php?doi=10.1152%2Fphysrev.00024.2006"

AdvancedFitness,34bvuq,Cthulu2013,-2,Fri May 1 02:02:02 2015 UTC,Just remember insulin resistance isn't always a bad thing. We need to be insulin resistant to burn fat. Ie fatty acids in the blood stream. The ability to switch between insulin resistant stares when food is not around and insulin sensitive is a key point in leanness and muscle growth.

AdvancedFitness,34bvuq,Cthulu2013,-1,Sat May 2 19:53:08 2015 UTC,"I think that the person who felt tired sooner is more sensitive.  They took up the glucose faster and are experiencing the roller coaster spiking/dropping in blood glucose. The person who is more insulin resistant would have a higher blood glucose level for longer, since the insulin is not as effective in initiating taking up glucose out of the blood.    This longer/higher blood glucose level would not necessarily be a good thing,  though,  and my experience with type 2 diabetics is that they feel just generally crummy malaise for several hours following such a meal.   Hope that helps!"
AdvancedFitness,34bvuq,kungfu_kickass,3,Thu Apr 30 02:09:34 2015 UTC,"You're confusing insulin sensitivity and resistance. Someone who is sensitive to insulin needs/produces less of it and is not going to have side effects.   Someone with insulin resistance (not sensitive) will need to keep producing more because they're resistant to it, which will more often give sides like being tired after a big meal. Plus there are other less immediately obvious but much more harmful effects.   As for being tired a few hours later, if it was me I'd suspect needing more total rest rather than it being an insulin related effect. This is not expertise on my part, just anecdotal experience. If I'm well rested I can eat as much as I can stuff in my stomach these days without feeling anything but full (if I needed the food I'll feel I have more energy/strength, not less). When I was 30 pounds heavier a few years ago I'd have trouble focusing after a sandwich for lunch."

I might've made a mistake because I was typing on my phone in bed or something,  but rereading it I think I got it right.    Your explanation on how I got them wrong is confusing to me though.    Insulin is required by insulin-sensitive tissues to bind to the cells within those tissues before they can take up glucose in the blood. You can be hyper/hypo/normo-insulinemic and also hyper/hypo/normo-glycemic.  They are separate but related chemicals.    An insulin resistant person will probably be hyperglycemic because their insulin is not effectively binding to the cells and thus glucose is staying in the blood longer than it should,  which we read as having higher levels than a person should have.  This may make them also hyperinsulinaemic since the pancreas continues to try to compensate,  but is not guaranteed.    What are you saying I said or how I was wrong?"

This resistant person, the one more likely to be hyperinsulinaemic, is the one reporting grogginess shortly after the big meal, yes?   They are also not insulin sensitive, yes? Because in general terms insulin sensitivity and glucose resistance have an inverse relationship.   So when I read your original comment:   I think that the person who felt tired sooner is more sensitive.    I thought you meant to write:   I think that the person who felt tired sooner is more resistant.    This be a difference of interpretation as well.

If you give an insulin sensitive and an insulin resistant person equal injections of glucose at the same time,  the insulin sensitive person will experience a sharp increase in blood glucose and then a sharp decrease since their insulin and receptors are functional.  All that insulin may produce a tired/hypoglycemic state until everything normalizes.   An insulin resistant person would experience a sharp increase in blood glucose followed by a long ongoing plateau/downward trend instead of a sharp decrease. They would not be hypoglycemic in the relevant future following the meal and wouldn't feel that same kind of tired.   That's my theory anyway.  I think we're on the same page on how things work.  I can freely admit that I don't actually know the answer to op's question and I'm just taking a stab."

It makes sense, too. More sarcomeres in series means that for a certain amount of total muscle shortening, each sarcomere has to shorten less. At any given muscle shortening velocity, each sarcomere in a longer fascicle gets to shorten at a slower total velocity, which puts it in a better spot on the force/velocity curve. In other words, each sarcomere in a longer fascicle can produce more force because they're each shortening more slowly, even though the whole muscle might be shortening at the same velocity as a muscle with shorter fascicles."

Calories and nutrients are two concepts that rely on each other.  1 gr Fat = 9 calories 1 gr Carbohydrate = 4 calories 1 gr Protein = 4 calories  A healthy diet usually has 50% carbs, 30% protein and 20% carbs. Its not the same to eat 2000 balanced calories with this balanced percentages than to eat 2000 calories of just fat. You're going to be short on nutrients, on protein, and exceed the amount of fat your body can process and obviously affect your metabolism. How is this surprising?"
AdvancedFitness,343ke2,aManPerson,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:39:46 2015 UTC,"so...all calories are not equal and what you eat matters?   This is a charged question that needs context.  In the context of energy, all calories are equal. The main possible nitpick is thermal effect variation. But people have famously lost weight eating primarily junk food and gained weight eating ""clean"" food. Calories are units of energy literally by definition.  In the context of body composition, protein is hugely important. This study, for instance, showed a 30% protein diet had the smallest reduction of REE and TDEE during weight loss, presumably because lean mass was best preserved. It was also higher fat.   In the context of hormones, fat is hugely important.   In the context of satiety, protein is very important and concomitant ingestion of fiber is also very important. Fats can also slow digestion. Some people thrive on more carbs too and the reasons why fat/carb proportions have so much individual variation are not fully understood.  In the context of glucose metabolism, carbohydrates are hugely important, as are proteins. There's implicit importance to fats too as they (and fiber) have a ""buffering"" effect.   Alan Aragon explains this very well as a hierarchy. At the very top you have total energy/calories. Below that you have macronutrient proportions. below that you have food quality. Below that you have meal timing. No level of that hierarchy can determine something contrary to the level above it. In other words, you cannot lose weight on a high protein diet of whole, unprocessed foods if you are eating at a caloric surplus. If two people are both eating at the same caloric balance, the one with the high protein diet of whole, unprocessed foods might see better results over time, and someone who eats junk on a particular schedule will not be able to outperform the person who has better macronutrient proportions."
AdvancedFitness,343ke2,aManPerson,-4,Tue Apr 28 11:53:41 2015 UTC,"correct.  As i've been reading up on the high fat stuff, i think a few different statements reflect it:   It matters more what hormones are triggered by the food.  What's kinda beat over your head numerous times, eating high fat/low carb wont trigger insulin, and won't as easily be stored as bodyfat. a calorie is when you burn 1g of food and it raises the water in the tank/calormiter by X degrees.  carbs and protein burn enough to raise it 4F.  oil/fats 9F per gram.  What chemical reaction is fire?  an oxidation.  I'm not a biochemistry major, but i dont think that's the basis for our energy production. a week or so back i was reading a biochemistry book about starvation, and what the body/metabolism does.  it talked about how fat was such a poor energy source for glucose production because bodyfat didnt have many carbons.  while carbohydrates were great because they did have a lot of carbons.  at the time, i remember saying "" i wonder if listing the # of carbons a food has would be a better 'biochemistry energy measurement'"". if you look at the chemicals used to convert protein and fat to an energy source (glucose or ketones) and count how much energy the body uses to produce them (so you're looking at a net energy production) fat only comes up with 4cal/g of fat, and protein something like 0.05 cal/gram of protein.   continuing on with this thinking, i've tried to come up with ideas as to what makes a good ""fat/protein/carb"" and what makes bad ones.  so far i've come up with these few categorizations:  good fat   higher in omega 3's higher in anachidonic acid saturated   bad fat    trans fat polyunsaturated (i think this the one)   good carb   lower glycemic, higher in fiber has good mineral content like magnesium, potassium or sodium.  calcium good too   bad carb   high glycemic (so triggers insulin) low minerals/other stuff   good protein   at least complete protein slow and fast digesting ones   bad protein   incomplete proteins unuseful or unnecessary amino acids  like l-tyrosine"

Omega 3 is a PUFA, Omega 6 PUFA's are the ones with a bit of bad press at the moment due to (as always) in excess they lead to oxidative stress, can oxidise LDL etc.  But they are required for life and are essential nutrients. Linoleic Acid is the most simple of the essential omega-6's, there are more but arachidonic acid (as you mentioned in your good fats) is one of the derivatives of linoleic acid.   The important takeaway is that there isn't jsut good an bad, black and white. THese systems are always far more complicated than that. Except for trans fats. Fuck them.

It can result in tripling of muscle mass if the MS gene is totally turned off. We know this because men like Flex Wheeler have the double KO genetics, and this has been studied in humans as well.  When given to kids with muscular dystrophy, tho the earlier forms of follastatin had side effects, it essentially made them normal. This form purports to be side effect free. That's needing of confirmation as the study was probably done by the company which makes it, and that means they have a vested interest which can colour their findings.  Its use in bodybuilding & athletics, if it truly creates a massive effect will be done, simply because strength & body size can be advantageous, if not over done. There have been numerous ""health supplements"" which made the claim of MS inhibition, none of which were the case. This finding of follastatin's muscle increase as a % isn't known, clearly.  Frankly, given full double KO of the MS gene (via RNA KO therapy, which exists), tripling muscle size can increase muscle power about 10 fold, maximally. & because power is proportional to the cross section of the muscle, that's an awesome increase.  Of course the side effects will be tearing of muscles, ligaments and tendons. If started too quickly can create a serious, even life threatening cardiopulmonary over load which could kill. And most of us know huge BB who are huffing and puffing most of the time anyway, due to this issue.

So instead of perceiving gene therapy as cheating, as many do with doping, could it come to be seen more as way to level the playfield? Especially if it is as safe as suggested by the trial linked by you. Where doping can have adverse effect this follistatin injection seems not to. Instead of asking why people would do that won't we be saying: why not? What's the harm?"

Given how PEDs are generally approached, there's absolutely no way that's happening. You can't compete if you're on HRT. People are banned for taking harmless OTC medication. I mean, there are limits on caffeine consumption.  Regarding legality... if you look at the shit-storm every time some progress is made in this field, then yeah, I don't see it being legally available outside clinical settings."
AdvancedFitness,3410vr,BlackAdam,0,Wed Apr 29 11:36:27 2015 UTC,"AAV Follistatin injection probably has side effects, as Follistatin affects the entire transforming growth factor beta family. But in this case they used an isoform (a compound similar but modified at the molecular level) of Follistatin that targets the MSTN pathway in order to avoid off-target site effects. More research will be needed to determine the impact of myostatin inhibition in humans, so I would be cautious to say it's adverse effect-free. Now as to whether it's 'doping' or not, that's an ethical question that science should not concern itself with. Laypeople would never understand anyway."
AdvancedFitness,3410vr,BlackAdam,2,Mon Apr 27 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"Depending on your scientific field matters of ethics and public value are of great concern. Though, to be fair, you should never do science without giving ethical concerns some degree of thought."
AdvancedFitness,3410vr,BlackAdam,2,Tue Apr 28 04:16:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I'm of the personal opinion that we shouldn't let the advancement of science be hindered by whatever moral values society holds true at a given moment. Morality is a highly subjective and ever-changing concept, and the standards of morality of today will most likely not be those of society in a thousand years. On the other hand, the principles that guide the physical universe will never change, and I believe that morality will drastically change as we come to understand how things work in our world. Do not be mistaken.... Science dictates morality, not the other way around."
AdvancedFitness,3410vr,Heroine4Life,2,Tue Apr 28 04:23:19 2015 UTC,"You can have morality without science, so to say that science dictates morality is a bit overly on the point. Science does at times challenge morality, and morality, or what is considered moral at a given time, is subject to change, I agree. However, it doesn't cover it to call it subjective, it's cultural as well. So what constitutes morality is both subjective, historical and institutionally contingent. It's not unthinkable that at times it would be wise to slow down scientific advancement for ethical reasons, i.e. like it would have been during WW2 with the nuclear arms race. There's a huge difference between doing something for the sake for doing and doing it for the right reasons, well knowing that those reasons might not be cause for valid concern in the next generation."

AdvancedFitness,33zpky,Gymrat777,5,Thu Apr 30 02:48:09 2015 UTC,"The author is correct in that if you just tell someone to exercise, they generally won't lose weight. People go on the treadmill for an hour, get more hungry and later make up for the calories they burned. So nutrition always has to be considered. Nutrition + exercise however is superior to only nutrition for preserving lean mass, possibly increasing the caloric deficit, increasing long-term adherence."
AdvancedFitness,33zpky,DieMafia,12,Fri May 1 13:02:44 2015 UTC,"Don't believe it. It is pretty much calories in, calories out. Exercise more to get calories out up.  The problem with the data is that exercise is simply not effective enough to counter the extremely high caloric diets you have from all the fast food people are eating. After a point, your body simply just cannot do enough exercise to burn the calories; either you get fatigued, bored, run out of time, etc.  That, combined with the fact that many  overweight and obese are leading an unhealthy lifestyle and most likely don't know HOW to exercise (type and length), think, ""Okay I exercised I can reward myself with food"". Well, a cupcake is gonna take you half an hour of light jogging to burn off, so you just wasted your efforts to lose weight.  So yeah, exercise seems to have no effect because people are just taking in too many calories on the side."

His articles go over global trends and plenty of empirical data to try and get a clear picture as to the multi-factor causes of weight gain.  His work is actually extremely solid, if you have the time I would recommend going through his series from the beginning.  The way each article builds on lessons learned from previous articles makes them much greater whole than the sum of their parts.  Remember though, ultimately he is looking at it through the lens of the systemic causes of obesity, he isn't focused on the optimization of fitness for athletes and bodybuilders.    That being considered, his look at the way insulin (resistance) is largely responsible for weight gain and the way various factors impact insulin levels and insulin sensitivity/resistance and fat storage is quite relevant to athletes looking to optimize their nutrition.

AdvancedFitness,33zpky,conisi,2,Mon Apr 27 06:38:09 2015 UTC,"Body builders, particularly in competition, have very unhealthy levels of body fats; they're too low. Their focus is on looking cut and showing off muscles.   There are two main sources of energy; fat and carbs. Fats turn into energy better, carbs turn into energy faster.  A bodybuilder will be using more carbs to get the explosive power needed to lift the weight. A marathon runner needs a relatively large amount of fat tissue to burn consistently throughout their run. There is a balance between having enough energy and having extra weight to carry though."
AdvancedFitness,33zpky,LoudCommentor,-2,Mon Apr 27 11:57:53 2015 UTC,"It's not that exercise makes you think you deserve a reward. It's that the body(brain/hypothalamus) try to preserve homeostasis. And in the case of fat/overweight people this means maintaining body fat.    Evidence seems to suggest that changes in the way the brain regulates hunger, which are present in obese people are permanent (even after 7 years). And in addition to this the brain/hypothalamus will down regulate metabolism (you move slower, you think slower, etc.)  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=207&v=jn0Ygp7pMbA). Some data even suggests dieting shortens your lifespan (http://www.ergo-log.com/unhealthydieting.html).   To put it simply: people who are fat shouldn't try to lose weight, they should eat healthy foods and exercise but there isn't any good reason to try and lose weight (other than vanity). Also, don't get fat in the first place, is a good rule-of-thumb."
AdvancedFitness,33zpky,Dedlifto,2,Mon Apr 27 06:49:46 2015 UTC,"Right. But having exercised gives people an excuse to give in to that hunger.   On your other points, yes. If someone were obese BUT fit, they are healthy. Research is consistently showing fitness, not fatness.  But obese people are more likely than not to be fat like that because they are unfit and unhealthy. High lipids, cholesterol, and high blood pressure are results of obesity. Each raises mortality.  Sure, the psychological focus for obese people should be, ""Eat healthy from now on"". But the reason for it is because they need to lose weight."

These data would suggest that dietary supplementation with arginine should increase circulating levels of IGF-1.' 'Supplementation with the branched chain amino acids, isoleucine and leucine, caused a reduction in serum levels of [Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2)], while the aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine and histidine, increased IGF-1 levels.

It has also been shown that skeletal muscle (SM) IGF-1 activates mTORC1. [see -> IGF-1 as a regulator of Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy and Atrophy] It is plausible that leucine can increase SM IGF1, elucidating another mechanism in which mTORC1 activity might be up-regulated.  Purpose: The effect of a single threshold dose of L-leucine given immediately after RE on serum leucine and IGF1, and SM IGF1, IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K  Methods: 9 resistance-trained men performed two separate testing sessions of 4 sets of 8-10 reps at 75-80% 1-RM on the angled leg press and knee extension exercises. Immediately after, 3g of L-leucine (LEU) or placebo in the form of gelatin capsules was ingested. Venous blood was obtained before, 0.5-, 2-, and 6-hr post-exercise, and a muscle biopsy obtained before, 2- and 6-hr post-exercise. A repeated measures ANOVA (treatment x time) for each criterion variable was performed.  Results: Increases were noted in serum [leucine] in LEU group (p=0.04), muscle IGF1 at 2-hr (p=0.03) and 6-hr (p=0.04), with no changes observed in serum IGF-1 (p=0.99), IGF-1R (p=0.84), Akt (p=0.55), mTOR (p=0.09), and P70S6K (p=0.98).  Conclusion: 3 g of L-leucine following a RE session does not appear to influence serum [IGF1] or mTORC1 signaling, but did preferentially increase IGF1 peptide content in SM."

AdvancedFitness,33qljn,tillow,3,Fri Apr 24 22:09:16 2015 UTC,"That is definitely fair to say.  It's useful to realize that most things related to the human body are on a spectrum. I got my BS in Kinesiology 2 years ago and am now in grad school for a related subject. We were taught there are three fiber types - I, IIa, and IIb. Here's an article from 2001 that explains that is it far more complicated (they suggest 7 fibers types but that's just their interpretation of the data.)   Regardless of the classification scheme used to group muscle fibers, there is overwhelming evidence that muscle fibers—and therefore motor units—not only change in size in response to demands, but they can also convert from one type to another.   Anatomy/physiology is very complicated so I understand why many professors and textbook authors break it down to simply. In addition, many internet bloggers/advice givers make things black and white. ""You can't run long distances or it will kill your gains."" Sure, that holds some truth. Does that mean you shouldn't run long distances since your goal is hypertrophy (i.e. looking good naked?) Absolutely not.

Also, hypertrophy is a function of greater synthesis (anabolism) to breakdown (catabolism) that requires adequate stimulus as well as nutrition to facilitate hypertrophy."
AdvancedFitness,33qljn,Robberbaron212,8,Sat Apr 25 01:15:58 2015 UTC,"Not beyond the novice effect Striker mentions.   There seems a floor on the effort or intensity required per rep that distance running will not satisfy (I think Schoenfeld has been trying to narrow this down with 30% vs 70% 1RM work, though we also know from blood-restriction that %1RM is not the end all factor). Those who need this effect for running-related activities can use things like prowler sleds.  Below that threshold you don't see training stimulus of hypertrophy like you do above it. Otherwise my right calf would be jacked because I tend to bounce that knee when I sit which has to be a lot of volume, right?  So if you put a guy who runs a marathon, or let's did 45,000 ""reps"", and put him on a bulking diet and have him train up to 60,000 ""reps"" even he will not see results similar to someone who goes from heavy lifts of 45,000 pounds over a given timeframe to 60,000 pounds.   I'd also think the training of distance running to ""extreme exhaustion"" would also tend to result in more type I fiber development than someone interested in muscle hypertrophy would want. Muscle fiber types can convert so if you're really interested in hypertrophy I think the first thing you want to do is lay off the distance running."
AdvancedFitness,33qljn,JSCMI,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:40:02 2015 UTC,What do you mean by a 'floor on the effort or intensity required per rep that distance running will not satisfy'?  How can you talk about 1RM's inside of a running or aerobic exercise environment? IE Could some running or sprinting protocol be said to be '70%' of a 1RM?  I'm not following
AdvancedFitness,33qljn,tadawdy,1 point,Sun Apr 26 08:30:59 2015 UTC,"To train the muscle fibers that hypertrophy dramatically, you have to activate and exhaust them. The ""endurance fibers"" are physically different muscle fibers that don't hypertrophy as dramatically. In a distance running situation performance will quickly be limited by factors other than strength & hypertrophy and those systems will experience progressive overload more than the muscles' strength & hypertrophy so I'm not saying distance running requires less mental effort or adaptation, I'm talking effort/intensity strictly in terms of maximal force output of a muscle.   The type I muscle fibers that take you distance running just don't (need to) hypertrophy like the type II's. Type I's have a knack for being able to just go and go. Once your type I's can carry you 5 miles then their ability to carry you 10 is primarily going to depend on training the systems that supply and support the type I's (plus non-muscular adaptations). Getting those first five (or however many miles) is your ""novice effect"" after which hypertrophy will rapidly diminish because type I's are energizer bunnies.   Type II fibers do a certain amount of work but have a knack for tearing the crap out of themselves generating a relatively high amount of force. When the demands on type II's are progressively overloaded, it is the type II's themselves that need to adapt to create more force and it is the ""support systems"" like VO2_max which will see diminishing progress.   Someone interested in training for size and strength is going to need to work with the range of intensity that activates and exhausts the relevant type II motor pools, i.e. not distance running. This is training specificity at work. The bottom of that range is a minimum threshold which I called a floor on the effort or intensity required per rep. Below that floor you're in the range that is primarily handled by type I fibers which are not going to have the same training response because they're physically different fibers. The type II's can roll over and sleep through the noise and they're never stimulated to grow. Worse, it might be possible the body tries to convert or get them to behave like type I's (but I'm not sure).   That's why if you compare the muscular adaptations of someone who is a world class squatter to a world class distance runner, the former has more hypertrophy every time. It doesn't mean the distance runner hasn't accomplished equally impressive adaptations and it's not a function of diet. Their feats require physically different adaptations.    How can you talk about 1RM's inside of a running or aerobic exercise environment? IE Could some running or sprinting protocol be said to be '70%' of a 1RM?   I'm using 1RM as a shorthand for ""maximum intensity."" So if you can imagine putting a prowler sled in front of a sprinter on their starting blocks, let the maximum amount of weight they can push through their normal motion off the block be the maximum intensity. Loading 70% of that would be kind of like 70% 1RM work. It's not really 70% of 1RM of anything, and it's not really aerobic work per se, but it's running related because it's a sprinting movement this exercise could be used as part of training to improve a sprint time.   None of this reference to ""effort"" is meant to imply distance running is easier so much as to distinguish between the amount of tension, in units of force, produced by a muscle at a given moment. If we're talking mental effort I would greatly prefer picking up twice my bodyweight over running a single mile."
AdvancedFitness,33qljn,jason_lifts,3,Mon Apr 27 12:37:42 2015 UTC,"Endurance training alone tends to cause a decrease in muscle fiber size. This is possibly adaptive, as it decreases diffusion distance and increases capillary density per volume.  There's a lot of research on concurrent training."

The snippet linked doesn't mention anything about protein intake or supplementation.  I'm thinking for instance of carbs around workouts which the Schoenfeld and Aragon review found to be effective, but only if the trainee took less protein than than was effective. Once protein intake was optimized, whatever benefit carbs gave was maximized along with it.   Perhaps this is the case with leucine (and other BCAA's) as well, because providing once protein benefit is optimized any benefit of protein components would be optimized as well. It would seem an easy explanation of why leucine (and other BCAA's) are reported as significantly helpful in some cases but useless in others."

Thus some highly adapted runners consuming less than 10% of energy from carbohydrate are able to oxidise fat at greater than 1.5 g/min during progressive intensity exercise and consistently sustain rates of fat oxidation exceeding 1.2g/min during exercise at ∼65% VO2max""  This is just fantastic if you're into very long-distance racing (ultras, like Noakes), which might happen around this level of exertion. Shorter races will most definitely require outputs of greater than 65% VO2 max.

AdvancedFitness,33i9rs,-_x,2,Wed Apr 22 20:36:23 2015 UTC,"The 'Top-Down' approach is based on the biopsychosocial model, which goes further in treating (chronic) pain by taking (as the name implies) not only purely biological factors into account but also possible psychological and social factors that may contribute as well. Whereas the ""conventional"" 'Bottom-Up' approach is purely based on a biomechanical understanding of pain, so basically ""dysfunctions"" and all other kinds of deviations from normal function lead to pain [period], which simply falls pretty short from what current pain science tells us.  There was a bit lengthy post on this last year on exercisebiology.com explaining some of the basic concepts:   Top Down: Basically, means changing your attitude, beliefs, knowledge (neurophysiology of pain) about your pain and in turn, lowering the threat value of pain. People get hurt, they experience pain, healing follows, and they recover. But in some folks the pain lasts forever. And why is that? According to one of the most well-accepted models - the fear-avoidance belief model -  people who have heightened fear of re-injury and pain are good candidates for chronic pain. Lack of knowledge or incorrect knowledge, beliefs ( hurt always means harm, my pain will increase with any activity and so forth), provocative diagnostic language and terminologies used by medical therapists like herniated disc, trigger points, muscle imbalance, and failed treatments can further heighten this fear or threat . So education to lower the threat is THE therapy here. We now have some very good evidence to show that just pain physiology education or the top-down approach is enough to lower pain and improve function  Bottom Up approach: The bottom-up approach is what we see around us: surgery, postural fixing, trigger point, muscle imbalance, movement re-education, manual therapy, acupuncture and the list keeps growing. Almost all treatments out there are trying to lower the nociceptive drive without much consideration to the top-down approach. This is solely because these treatments are based on the outdated model of pain. We now suspect that positive effects of manual therapy may be due to neural mechanisms than the tissue and joint pathology explanations that is often offered. So even the bottom up approach is working via de-sensitizing the nervous system. Although not intended, there are top-down mechanisms clearly at work even in bottom up approaches( like the placebo effect, a credible explanatory model, the belief in the therapist) .   Todd Hargrove's book A Guide To Better Movement is also a fantastic read on this from a ""layman's perspective""."

Previous research has found that fructose triggers the brain's hedonic pathway but not its satiety mechanisms, leading to something that nutritionists colloquially refer to as the 'sugar-craving cycle'. This is why fructose rich food products (soft drinks, candy, ice cream, chocolate bars, etc.) sell so well.   From an evolutionary perspective, sugar-rich foods used to be scarcely found in nature and associated with a high degree of energy density (for example, in fruits), and therefore our ancestors evolved to find them extremely rewarding to eat. But what happens  when foods that are extremely rewarding to eat are no longer scarce and energy dense? The result is obesity, dysglycemia & other metabolic diseases.   This is essentially an evolutionary mismatch between ancestral adaptations to environment and the industrialization of society, and it has turned the food market into the business of slowly killing people."

However, in nature, fruits and vegetables are still where sugar is mostly found; these, with a few exceptions, have a low to intermediate  impact on blood sugar level, are not very caloric, and are packed with micro nutrients. My theory is that one of the reasons why humans evolved to like sugar so much is because sugar foods were ancestrally associated with things that humans want to eat in order to survive, such as fruits and vegetables as aforementioned. But when you remove the fibers, remove the micro nutrients, combine the sugar with high amounts of dietary fat, and modify the glucose/fructose ratio in favor of the latter to make it more addictive (as fructose stimulates the dopamine pathways more so than other monosaccharide sugars do), it becomes something entirely different.

For instance, supplementation of feed with 200 ppm clenbuterol for 21 days decreased the mass of the adipose fat pad tissue in mice (Page et al., 2004). In birds, supplementation of feed with 1 ppm clenbuterol for 21 days resulted in decreased abdominal fat pad tissue (Rehfeldt et al., 1997), and oral administration of 0.25 ppm clenbuterol for 30 days decreased abdominal fat pad tissue weight (Hamano, 2002). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the adipose-reducing effect of clenbuterol have not been established.  Recently, Sato et al. (2008) have reported that a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a PPARc agonist into newly hatched chicks resulted in decreased adipose tissue fat accumulation at 48 days of age. In the current study, to investigate the effects of clenbuterol on the adipose tissue development during the early life of birds, we performed a single i.p. injection of clenbuterol into 1-day-old chicks.""   So the only real long-term effect stuff they're looking at is regarding preadipocyte differentiation, which is largely only relevant to a developing organism (we differentiate all the majority of our fat cells when we're young - adults mostly get fatter by making fat cells larger rather than making more fat cells).     These results suggest that clenbuterol injection may affect the later phase of adipocyte differentiation/maturation in the abdominal fat pad tissue by decreasing the expression of mRNAs encoding of KLF-15 and ZNF423.  In conclusion, a single clenbuterol injection into 1-day-old chicks reduced the size of cells in the abdominal fat pad tissue by decreasing the expression of mRNA encoding KLF-15, ZNF423, FAS, and ACC during later growth stages, resulting in abdominal fat pad tissue mass reduction.""   Other than that, most of the effects they're looking at with a short-term mRNA analysis (rather than epigenetic changes or longitudinal observation) are only relevant fairly short-term (mRNA lifespan is minutes-days).  As well, these results are fairly specific to birds because the expression patterns for KLF-2, KLF-5 KLF-15, ZNF423, and FGF10 are very different in birds and mammals.    Overall, this study really is not applicable directly to human fitness.  The most practical application I can think of is injecting chickens and turkeys with clen to get leaner meat, which in my personal humble opinion is probably a horrible application because I would rather see my food exercising and having a good diet than shooting up clen, and I can't see it as being super cost-effective.  Maybe I'm just unimaginative."
AdvancedFitness,339vpg,Fit-Kucheka,3,Wed Apr 22 00:21:57 2015 UTC,"To summarize the article: they looked at three mRNA encoding genes: Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor 5 (KLF-5), zinc finger protein 423 (ZFP423) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG). KLF-5 and ZFP423 are involved in adipogenesis, the process by which cell differentiation causes preadipocytes to become mature adipocytes. PPARG is involved in fatty acid synthesis, the process by which acetyl coA is converted to fatty acids. Expression rate of KLF-5 and ZFP423 was lower in clenbuterol-injected group than in control group. Expression rate of PPARG was lower in abdominal fat tissue."

You're likely now at a normal level, trying to get leaner.   Adjust your calories up gradually.  Try to eat as much as you can while keeping your weight constant.  Protein should be moderate to high and get a good balance of fat and carbs.  Seek to optimize the quality of your diet and focus only on health and fitness.  That should estabilish your actual maintenance level.  Then do an relatively intense high protein low carb cycle for up to 1 month.  Then go back to maintenance again and repeat until you get where you want."
AdvancedFitness,338zx0,StuWard,2,Mon Apr 20 17:14:52 2015 UTC,"The issue I face is the bloated puffy nature of the reaction to what's going on. If I look at my calculated maintenance - which is about 2000 calories at 5'7' 150lbs - I have been eating well below that and not losing weight. I am neurotic about weighing and tracking (yes I know we hear that all the time), but my average caloric intake is 1550 cals over a weekly basis. This was upped slowly since December, after a 4 month PSMF. I upped from 800 to 1000 to 1200 to 1300 to 1400 and now 1500. I teeter between 150-156lbs now. Never going lower. Clothes fit the same; just get uncomfortable on higher bloat days. I feel like there is more fat around my middle as I feel my breasts and upper body look as though they are disappearing. Eating carbs makes me feel like crap a few hours after and then the next day I have infinite energy. So many factors confusing me; I get more and more neurotic about weighing and tracking my intake; running more miles (for a couple weeks I was clocking in 50 miles of cardio a week on top of 5 days lifting heavy).  Is 1550 my maintenance? Is that the metabolic adaptation of my deficit? Or am I being fooled by the scale and water retention? It doesn't help that I don't sleep well, run on a lot of coffee and an EC stack, and workout 6-7 days a week."

I would cut exercise to 3 strength training workouts a week and an hour of gentle walking the other days.  Work on reducing stress, get rid of the supplements, coffee only in the morning.  Focus on achieving balance and stability.  Experiment with the types of food so you can determine the reasons for the bloating.  Give it a good month or two.  Then ratchet down the fat in gradual stages.  This is a long term effort and you need to learn what works over the long term.  You're far healthier now than you were a few years ago.  Don't be in a hurry."

I think he's pretty clear that nobody should be on that kind of extreme diet for that long--the idea is to kick-start your weight loss.  He also does not recommend working out very much while doing it--light weight training and no cardio at all.  Are you still eating that way, just with more calories while doing 50 miles of cardio and lifting five days a week?  If so, that's your problem.   You're not losing weight probably because your cortisol is through the roof, which leads to bloating around the middle and face.  The amenorrhea is a clear sign that your hormones are all fucked up."

Since December (took a bit of a diet break through the holiday), I increased cals as I explained below slowly over the course of 4 months and I went from 800 to about 1550 now. So reverse dieting.

It doesn't matter that you're working out. How is the body going to sustain itself (not just muscularly but also hormonally) if it's not getting the minimum amount of resources to sustain its current self.  Working out 6-7 days a week on a cut sounds like madness, by the way.  Why are you stressing your body out so much? Is there any point for the number on the scale to drop further ASAP because clearly there is nothing healthy about it at this point.

It's nothing I force myself to do, just what I really enjoy doing, resistance training being my favorite. I have a desk job, so I feel trapped and restrained much of my day. Daily exercise probably, in my mind, makes up for my sedentary job. I also have a 6 year old, so I try to keep her busy and active when I'm not chained to my desk.  My rationale in the past 4 months is that I'm not on a cut, as 1550 cals has maintained my weight. I need to fix that, obviously. I should be able to maintain on 2000. I want to eat 2000 cals!

But I just turned out to lose fat and my physique actually turned to shit (despite having less fat) because I was also losing muscle as well.  It's just what happens when you're on a deficit.  If you think 2000 is too extreme, then bump it up to 1800 and see how that helps.  I still think strength-training 5x a week is a bit much.  Anyway, listen to StuWard.

It’s a concept that tends to be counterintuitive (how does going off a diet make it work better) but in my experience and with what the research says, it works. People tend to fixate on short-term results (as noted above they want to BE LEAN NOW) but for most applications, long-term adherence is far more important.  In the big scheme of things, what is two weeks not losing fat if, not only does the break mean you lose fat MORE effectively (because you’ve normalized hormones) but you increase your odds of long-term success by not being so psychologically stressed all the time."

That most people stop losing because they are under calculating intake.   So, with that in mind, I keep telling myself that I am making a mistake somewhere. Weigh more, restrict more, workout more. Nothing further happens.   It's not this black and white thing after losing so much weight to 'take a break', especially when you're not at your goal. I'm not an idiot, I understand what is being said. I just want to be careful to not begin a cycle of 'yo-yo' dieting. What is the science behind my stall, and what is the expert approach to trouble shooting this issue? I'm not an ultra lean bodybuilder. Layne Norton and his like speak to this audience. I'm not obese; so I'm not applying denial.  But what can be causing a 4 month stall? Because ultimately if in a caloric deficit, I should be losing weight. It's not like I'm applying 'fat logic' here; I'm in advanced training and dieting levels. I scale measure my food.  Take a break is easier said than done; I need guidance now more than I ever have. I have lost 115 lbs on my own; I've learned to squat 2 plates on my own...I need hand holding now. I want to lean out and I want to increase my lifts at some point. I've stalled on both counts.

Edit: also in the study above the low load group was almost certainly below 60% 1RM because they were doing sets of 25-35 to failure.

This study does not cover caloric restriction, but is still relevant.  ""Abstract  Resistance training (RT) is a proven sarcopenia countermeasure with a high degree of potency. However, sustainability remains a major issue that could limit the appeal of RT as a therapeutic approach without well-defined dosing requirements to maintain gains.  PURPOSE:  To test the efficacy of two maintenance prescriptions on muscle mass, myofiber size and type distribution, and strength. We hypothesized the minimum dose required to maintain RT-induced adaptations would be greater in the old (60-75 yr) versus young (20-35 yr).  METHODS:  Seventy adults participated in a two-phase exercise trial that consisted of RT 3 d·wk for 16 wk (phase 1) followed by a 32-wk period (phase 2) with random assignment to detraining or one of two maintenance prescriptions (reducing the dose to one-third or one-ninth of that during phase 1).  RESULTS:  Phase 1 resulted in expected gains in strength, myofiber size, and muscle mass along with the typical IIx-to-IIa shift in myofiber-type distribution. Both maintenance prescriptions preserved phase 1 muscle hypertrophy in the young but not the old. In fact, the one-third maintenance dose led to additional myofiber hypertrophy in the young. In both age groups, detraining reversed the phase 1 IIx-to-IIa myofiber-type shift, whereas a dose response was evident during maintenance training with the one-third dose better maintaining the shift. Strength gained during phase 1 was largely retained throughout detraining with only a slight reduction at the final time point.  CONCLUSIONS:  We conclude that older adults require a higher dose of weekly loading than the young to maintain myofiber hypertrophy attained during a progressive RT program, yet gains in specific strength among older adults were well preserved and remained at or above levels of the untrained young."""

The more muscle you maintain for a certain weight, the easier the diet. More muscle burns more energy. And using your muscles for strength training somewhat keeps your body from ""eating"" and converting them into energy.  To answer your question directly, hitting each muscle once a week could be adequate, if you hit 'em hard enough. If you are calorie deficient, of course the whole restitution/injury perspective comes into play - but if you only train hard once a week - this shouldn't be too much of a problem.   Keep an eye on the mirror and your strength numbers and adjust accordingly. If times is the issue, consider switching to fullbody instead of split."

AdvancedFitness,3291he,CuriouslyCultured,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:35:18 2015 UTC,I think it isn't because if you fit it all in 1 day that's too much volume for a person on cut whose been eating a deficit for other 6 days.

AdvancedFitness,3291he,meukow,-2,Sun Apr 12 13:48:29 2015 UTC,"It's depends on the rate of your cut.  If you are eating very close to maintenance then you can keep putting on mass (slowly).  If you are cutting more than that then you are just trying to spare muscle during the cut.  For a reasonable cut (not too severe) you could work upper body once a week and lower body (larger muscles) less often than that.  I'm not sure if once a month is enough for lower body.  If you are on an aggressive cut then you will need to do more to preserve muscle protein.  First, your cut diet will need to be mostly protein.  Second, you will need to stimulate your muscles more than maintenance levels."

AdvancedFitness,3291he,grae313,-3,Sun Apr 12 04:44:30 2015 UTC,"If you want to maintain strength, you likely want to increase protein consumption to 2g per kg of bodyweight.  Keep fat consumption the same but reduce carbohydrate consumption to allow for the increased protein consumption.  Be sure to consume quality protein and preferably BCAAs prior to and during training and time your carbohydrate consumption wisely.  A window within six hours of training (~3 hours prior to and ~3 hours post) is ideal for maintaining and then replenishing glycogen levels so a large portion of your daily carbohydrate consumption should be within this window.  Outside of this window, carbohydrate consumption isn't a bad thing but nutrient timing is important for muscle function and recovery.  Limit your weight cut to 1% of bodyweight per week, lift heavy on bench and squat twice per week and deadlift heavy once per week.  Heavy = work up in singles, doubles, or triples to a heavy set of 1, 2, or 3.  Limit backdown sets, limit anything in higher rep ranges, including accessory work.  You can keep your RPT program but on a cut you'll likely stay at the same weight but you won't necessarily have to lower the weights if you cut wisely.  Finally, limit cardio.

I can barely move up in weight on a serious bulk let alone a 1lb/week cut.  I should have mentioned this isnt my first cut, but this was advanced fitness. So my original question: why lift often on a cut?"
AdvancedFitness,3291he,Pejorativez,-2,Sun Apr 12 04:43:09 2015 UTC,"From my original response, ""You can keep your RPT program but on a cut you'll likely stay at the same weight but you won't necessarily have to lower the weights if you cut wisely.""  So no, you wouldn't be moving up in weight.  Why lift often?  You need to impose a strength demand on your body so that you maintain an adaptation to strength training rather than lose that adaptation.  Adding in the frequency of 2x/week versus 1x/week gives you a better chance of ensuring that your body remembers that you need to stay strong and thus to not send signals that would commence atrophy of muscle mass and/or strength levels.  Sort of the same reasoning behind benching or squatting twice a week even while not on a cut - you're adding additional stimulus and even if you don't increase total volume but rather simply divide the existing total volume between two days instead of one, you'll get a better stimulus and adaptation response.  All of the hormones related to muscle maintenance and/or growth that are elevated during and immediately after strength training begin to taper off after a day or two.  You're spiking that hormonal response or keeping it on a higher average level of elevation with increased frequency.  All of that being said, the key to not doing too much is by doing what I mentioned, limit yourself to lower rep ranges.  Less hypertrophy will produce less muscular microtrauma and thus less fuel requirements.  During a cut you don't want your body to need to much fuel, you'll start metabolizing your own muscle tissue along with adipose tissue and then you'll defeat your objective of maintaining strength."
AdvancedFitness,3291he,Tumbalo2,0,Sun Apr 12 05:17:33 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that you increase workout frequency on a cut compared to when you are on a bulk, also on a cut the weights loads lifted are less because it with the more frequent sessions.  On a bulk you need to have enough rest to grow optimally, on the cut you want to burn the fat and maintain the muscle by just reducing the weight.

AdvancedFitness,3291he,Tumbalo2,-3,Mon Apr 13 14:31:49 2015 UTC,"You might reduce the weight for multiple reasons.... Intensity remains the same, as high as possible.  When you are not eating nearly as much as normal you just won't have the energy to lift the heavy weight like you do on a bulk, that coupled with the increased frequency of lifting would be overkill, and lifting heavy with 2x frequency greatly increase the chance of an injury without allowing time for recovery,  so that is not a direct reason but it plays its role.  By increasing frequency and decreasing the weight by 10-15% more or less, you lift it keeps the metabolism burning calories continuously while also helps prevent some muscle from atrophy that would occur if frequency is kept the same as on a bulk.  I am no expert, so my terms may not be correct but I think you get the point.  Of course you could also cut by just reducing calories with same frequency, but it would take longer and more muscle atrophy would occur."

AdvancedFitness,3291he,Tumbalo2,-1,Tue Apr 14 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"If you normally workout each muscle once week and keep your training the same, just reducing calories into a deficit would still be considered a cut.   What part of what I said are you asking about?  I can see what is quoted, but I don't know what you are asking me for specifically.   The part before the portion you quoted that was if you were to  increase your frequency as in twice a week or more.... Keeping intensity up, it will most likely just be that you have to use less weight because of the fact you just can't lift as heavy due to not having the same type of fuel, as in high amounts if carbs pre, intra, and post or anytime for most part because you are on a cut, and that normally low carbs, at least what I do...     And to prevent injuries when your body is in a state if shock, which, from increasing frequency and going into a deficit, it just a precaution, it might add an extra rep or two onto your set, just a little bit lower weight.

Of course reducing calories is cutting, but my questions is remains how is reducing weights + increasing frequency leading to less atrophy when compared to the original higher weight/less frequency scheme. For example, Lyle McDonald argues that this is not a good approach and keeping high-tension (which I was calling intensity, but whatever word you want to describe it) is best. It's been my experience when cutting as well and attempts to increase frequency + reduce weights failed horribly (strength dropping fail)."

AdvancedFitness,322ggn,TheMooJuice,5,Fri Apr 10 05:27:25 2015 UTC,Only number of sets are equated. It's almost the exact study I would have designed myself... I only would have included a 1-3 reps group.

AdvancedFitness,322ggn,_Omar_,3,Fri Apr 10 12:02:06 2015 UTC,I ask because that tends to be what happens on most novice level programs - SS or SL generate failure on the last set or two.  It would also justify the 5/3/1 and GSLP design of having a final AMRAP set
AdvancedFitness,322ggn,_Omar_,6,Fri Apr 10 12:55:13 2015 UTC,"Well, we definitely know at this point that multiple sets to failure even in novices has a greater effect than a single set to failure. However, learning the movements is probably as good a reason as any to keep failing to that one set at the end.  I do think beginner programs like that are only useful until a person learns the movement, and that beginner strategy can be applied any time a lifter wants to learn something new. If we're looking for maximal muscle growth, a single set to failure at the end probably isn't the way. Beginner programs, in my opinion, should only be run for maybe 12 weeks before making slight changes to reach goals better."
AdvancedFitness,322ggn,TheMooJuice,3,Fri Apr 10 13:06:19 2015 UTC,"But wouldn't multiple sets to failure require more recovery between workouts, which can lead to lesser volume in a given week/month, hence having less progress?"

AdvancedFitness,323nfe,TunaBoo,2,Fri Apr 10 19:42:43 2015 UTC,"First off, you want to keep your legs strong for climbing. If you're depending too much on upper body strength for climbing, your technique needs improvement.  I would suggest training as if you were on a cut and focus on maintaining intensity, but dropping as much volume as possible. For example, do a single set of heavy squats once a week in the 3-5 rep range.  Look into using extremely heavy partial lifts (the one time a quarter squat is actually acceptable) to strengthen your ligaments and tendons.  Climbing and muscle weight is a complicated trade off. Some muscles are worth it to let grow, such as forearms, lats, triceps, and core muscles. You'll want to train them for endurance, which involves very high rep ranges with light weights. Inducing hypertrophy is unavoidable. Other  muscles, such as pecs, quads, hamstrings, and biceps, you can focus on high weight, low rep, low total volume.  When working on lats and forearms, use specialized equipment like fingerboards to train. The extra focus on tendon strength in your fingers will pay off significantly.  Also make sure to spend plenty of time on training mobility, flexibility, and balance. I hate yoga, but goddamn can it transfer to climbing well.  Sincerely,  Someone who fell in love with lifting more than climbing, but still lifts at the climbing gym and occasionally still climbs by doing unnecessary pull ups to get up the wall."

AdvancedFitness,323nfe,halfaliter,7,Fri Apr 10 11:11:43 2015 UTC,"I do not think that you would be that much better at climbing, even if you'd really lose 14kg of bodyweight. I am a cyclist myself and do know some of the physics and biomechanics involved into cycling. Do some easy physical calculations - per 3kg of lost bodymass, you save about 1W of power. 14kg equals about 3,5W of power saved - that really is not a lot, especially considering that you will lose way more power from the reduce in muscle mass. Just to give you a comparison for the wattages - if you ride on a flat surface, you can save up to 50W just by riding in the drops. Weight does not really matter that much, even if almost everyone in the cycling industry wants you to believe that it does."
AdvancedFitness,323nfe,halfaliter,0,Fri Apr 10 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"In climbing power /weight ratio does improve that much 450 Watts FTP with 90 kg = 5 Watt/kg, 450 watts with 70 kg = 6.42 Watt /kg you can calculate what hourly altitude gain in both cases and see that weight is crucial factor"
AdvancedFitness,323nfe,oreejoe,7,Fri Apr 10 17:38:57 2015 UTC,I doubt that any human can maintain the same FTP after losing 20kg of bodyweight (without the use of exogenic aids).

Shouldn't someone who can squat 315lbs x20 reps climb a hill more efficiently and quicker that someone who can only squat 185lbs x20 reps?  The only way I can think of to lose muscle mass is to be in a constant state of atrophy.  Eating less food, less protein and not training your legs with weights.  Or maybe just do high rep endurance training for your legs."

Going back to the squat example, the 315lbs squatter could easily squat the 185lbs for a far greater amount of reps, say in the 30-40rep range. I just feel that being stronger will give you a greater potential to pedal for longer without getting tired during steep inclines.

The reason they say this is because a big part of fasting is insulin levels and only protein and carbs affect insulin. Fats do not. So they are probably just basing it off that."
AdvancedFitness,31zrk0,simple_mech,3,Thu Apr 9 16:42:06 2015 UTC,"I'm curious if you could expand on the role of insulin here. In my advanced nutrition class we were talking about Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL) that serves to mobilize triglycerides from adipose tissues. HSL is inhibited by insulin, which makes sense here because if you're getting carbs from your diet then your body would want to hold onto it's fat stores until they're needed.  So is this why the pure fats don't reset the benefits of fasting, since to be in the fasted state, glycogen must be low? Thus, if you're in a fasted state, your body is using adipose tissue for energy, or what you get from your diet. If you get carbs then you exit the fasted state, but if you eat pure lipids, then they are used for energy in between when adipose tissue is used.  I'm not an expert, I was just learning about this today, so I'm asking if this thinking is correct in relation to insulin?"

Preventing obesity with time-restricted feeding (TRF; 8–9 hr food access in the active phase) is promising, yet its therapeutic applicability against preexisting obesity, diverse dietary conditions, and less stringent eating patterns is unknown. Here we tested TRF in mice under diverse nutritional challenges. We show that TRF attenuated metabolic diseases arising from a variety of obesogenic diets, and that benefits were proportional to the fasting duration. Furthermore, protective effects were maintained even when TRF was temporarily interrupted by ad libitum access to food during weekends, a regimen particularly relevant to human lifestyle. Finally, TRF stabilized and reversed the progression of metabolic diseases in mice with preexisting obesity and type II diabetes. We establish clinically relevant parameters of TRF for preventing and treating obesity and metabolic disorders, including type II diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and hypercholesterolemia.  TL;DR:     TRF can help prevent obesity It is unknown if TRF can REVERSE obesity The study used mice with Type II Diabetes THE STUDY USED MICE WITH TYPE II DIABETES The diabetic mice were able to RETAIN obesity levels when caloric intake was leveled or increased to match excercise levels (obese, fit mice were the result)   http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413114004987"

The results of this study suggest that fasting may mitigate some of the harmful effects of chemotherapy,"" said co-author Tanya Dorff, assistant professor of clinical medicine at the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital. ""More clinical studies are needed, and any such dietary intervention should be undertaken only under the guidance of a physician."" ""We are investigating the possibility that these effects are applicable to many different systems and organs, not just the immune system,"" said Longo, whose lab is in the process of conducting further research on controlled dietary interventions and stem cell regeneration in both animal and clinical studies.   The ""pretty comprehensive article on the benefits of fasting"" ends with this:   Future research is warranted to test whether the health promoting effects described in animal studies have some validity in humans. We are in the very infancy of research on intermittent fasting in human subjects and future studies with larger sample sizes, longer durations and of better study design must be completed before any definite conclusions can be made regarding intermittent fasting and human health and the applicability to modern lifestyle.

AdvancedFitness,31zrk0,Jonassen86,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:07:05 2015 UTC,"There's evidence that IF can improve insulin sensitivity. Many do IF along with fasted exercise, and exercise is also known to improve insulin sensitivity. IFers probably don't care about fat because it can help with inflammation and it doesn't affect insulin levels. Convenience is hardly the only benefit when you consider the impact insulin sensitivity can have on body composition.  Do you disagree?"
AdvancedFitness,3211p1,dolomiten,4,Thu Apr 9 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"There's individual variance so no formulas are inherently better or worse for everyone.   Some of this is how you train. If you do a lot of 1-3 RM work then you're going to be relatively strong in that rep range. If you do a lot of 8-10RM work then you're going to be relatively strong in that range.   Some pros, e.g. Brad Schoenfeld, have noted that it seems like women tend to be able to lift a higher number of reps below their 1RM (for instance a man might do 3-4 reps at 90% 1RM whereas a woman might do 5-7 reps at 90% of their 1RM). As far as I know gender differences have never been formally tested. Even if it is true, it could relate to a possible tendency for men to be more likely to train near their 1RM.   Since you'll be strongest in the ranges you train, and since you probably train in the ranges you care about, there's really no good way to perform this estimate. You either know your 1RM from training it or your actual 1RM will be disproportionately low compared to the strength you train in. That means a formula that gives a true 1RM you could do today will not adequately represent how strong you are in the range you currently train, whereas a 1RM that adequately represents how strong you are in the range you currently train will be more than you could actually lift for 1 rep."

AdvancedFitness,31rg4w,purenitrogen,5,Tue Apr 7 16:15:00 2015 UTC,"For pushing through being out of breath, check out stuff related to VO2 max. You can train your VO2 max quickly (about a month) and then it gets pretty hard to move after those initial gains.  Edit: I want to add a bit more for the other items (non-nutrition). There are several adaptations your body goes through with endurance training. Neuromuscular is first (getting the right muscle to fire with the right intensity in the right order). This takes a few weeks to adapt. Then VO2 max. Then you need to rely on muscular growth for gains (the next 3-6 months), then you start the slow process of building your energy systems (such as how efficiently your body oxidizes fat for energy). This last one takes years (decades?).  If you want to know more, check out Friel's Triathlete's Training Bible or Cyclist's Training Bible, Jack Daniel's Running Formula or Pfitzinger's Advanced Marathoning. These aren't right on point for what you are talking about, but they give you an idea of endurance training."

Caloric deficit and Cardiovascular Improvement - on less calories you will not be able to push yourself hard consistently to keep making progress - unless you're doing an activity you're a novice at.  Minimum duration of cardio - When your'e at an advanced fitness level, training will come down to specificity.  If you run a lot, you stay good and get better and running. If you row a lot, the same will occur.  If you do a lot of long distance, you'll be good at long distance. If you do short distance you'll be good at short distance. It's an overly simplified, but unless there's a specific goal, its difficult to give you a good answer.  Cardio Maintenance level - Same as above.  If you want to maintain ultra-marathon fitness, you'll have to stay fairly close to ultra-marathon like volume. I would say that you will adjust to what cardio you're working at, as you said.  Is there a psychological component to pushing through feeling out of breath like the burn in weight training - Yes there is a psychological component.

Training specificity came up often in the literature when I was reading. As you said with the maintenance level, others seem to agree that you'd have to stay fairly close to the volume you're training for to stay there. I've been bodybuilding a fairly long time and I'm happy with the way I look aesthetically, but in terms of cardio I'm pushing like a 12 minute or so mile. I've made it my summer goal to improve that, and I find that having more knowledge (as I do with the physiology of muscle growth) keeps me more motivated to improve, because I understand why I'm improving. Thanks again."
AdvancedFitness,31rg4w,aTrendyCloset,0,Wed Apr 8 13:29:21 2015 UTC,"Like the others, I can give some answers but don't have sources handy.   The heart gets better basal blood flow than skeletal muscles, so it gets more nutrients to pick from even at rest. Yes, I've seen a few studies that seem to put that number at 10min for steady state cardio.  For intervals, I've seen progress reported from as few as six 10s sprints.  *Edit - this applies to beginners, which should be somewhat intuitive.  A 10min jog won't do much for a marathon runner. Have you heard the dose-response analogy for exercise?  That applies here.  If you're looking for a number, like to maintain peak performance you have to at least train with x% of that, I don't know that that lower threshold has been defined. It's psychological and physiological.  The psychological component partially comes from sounds.  Hearing yourself breath hard, or grunt or wheeze, increases psychological fatigue.  Listening to music during cardio isn't just entertaining, it mitigates this effect."

I would like to start off by stating that there is a difference between cardiovascular endurance and muscular endurance. Obviously the more you run, the more each will increase but they are their own separate entity. To answer your second question, yes there is a minimum amount of cardio required to physiologically improve. Think of a marathon runner. Running a slow 5k every day would not maintain his cardiovascular state. He needs to keep his training level high to increase his VO2 max. Hopefully that answers your third question as well. Regarding pushing through the pain, your body has its limits. There is an absolute limit to your cardiovascular ability, which is your VO2 max. However, most people start to taper off before they reach this limit because they cannot tolerate the pain mentally. Back to your first question, that is something I would like to know the answer to myself."
AdvancedFitness,31rg4w,Treebeard560,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:29:55 2015 UTC,How can you possibly train cardio endurance without also training muscular endurance?  I'd say they are not totally 'separate identities' and that there is considerable overlap.

When I read Practical Programming by Rippetoe, his intermediate style programming, the Texas Method, reminded me of the DUP concepts I learned as an undergraduate.  Texas Method / DUP  Volume day (5x5) / Hypertrophy  Light day (3x5) / Speed/power  Intensity day (1x5RM) / Strength day  So my current understanding is that it appears that DUP can be most beneficial for an intermediate lifter who can still progression through linear increases in weight per week on Intensity day (+5lbs every time you get ready for a 5RM, in this example).  Both programs can be changed significantly to produce different results. They both are extremely taxing on the body through producing significant stress and requires a great amount of recovery, hence why in my experience, i've only seen barbell sports (powerlifting, weightlifting, even bodybuilding) applying such concepts to their training."

Since different amounts of glucose were used it is unlikely that the GF group could have restored enough glycogen to be considered similar to the glucose only group. The 1 hour test also shows glycogen concentrations to be similar but glucose absorption would be slower in the GF group since it is mixed with fructose which lends support to fructose being taken up by skeletal muscle.

AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,eatsardines,5,Fri Apr 3 21:28:33 2015 UTC,"Am also curious. My journey: runner -> cyclist -> triathlete -> ironman -> muddle-athlete. I've done a ton of reading and Viada gets dropped frequently when discussion turns to concurrent training (strength/endurance).   Last year, I was doing HIIT twice a week and lifting heavy three times a week and progressed quickly on both my mile times (sub six-minute) and my deadlift (360 lb x3). I'm not an elite athlete by any stretch, but I had some consolation knowing that being in the 90% percentile (speed) and the 90% percentile (strength) probably put me in the 98% percentile combined. If that shit makes sense.    Would love to hear more from folks who have real-world success getting both faster and stronger."
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,Gymrat777,2,Fri Apr 3 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"Your improvement is great, but a mile time doesn't have much to do with endurance sports like Viada claims to be good at."
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,eatsardines,5,Sat Apr 4 03:00:18 2015 UTC,"Well, kind of. Great milers are twigs. I've done a lot of running -- and know that if you've got a great mile time, that extrapolates neatly to your half or full-marathon time. Just logging the miles.   But yeah, I'm still riding occasional centuries, but mostly I've given up longer endurance events (e.g. full marathons), as I don't see them as optimal for good-health. Challenging, for sure. But not optimal for good-health."
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,Dickenmouf,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:00:09 2015 UTC,"I'm new to fitness, but I've started incorporating hiit exercises into my weightlifting routine. I want to run a sub 15 minute 5k and deadlift 2.5 my weight. What type of hiit exercise are you doing? What does your routine look like, if you don't mind me asking? My worry is that hiit sprints coupled with deadlifts and squats, that often, might be too taxing on the the leg muscles and joints. What has been your experience?"
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,eatsardines,2,Sat Apr 4 05:25:39 2015 UTC,"Whoa. So my best 5k is 18:08, so I'm not the guy you want to talk to if super-fast race time is your primary goal. For that, you probably need a ton of volume (75 miles + / week).   For me, my primary goal right now is strength. Secondary is to get faster on my bike. My schedule looks like this:   M: Deads, Chins // Easy ride Tu: Tempo ride Wed: Bench, Dips // Easy ride Thur: Rest Fri: Squats // Easy ride Sat: HIIT/Intervals Sun: Long, easy ride   Be sure to get at least one day of complete rest every week.

AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,jam97322,17,Thu Apr 30 06:02:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know how effective his methods are, but Alex Viada has a record for avoiding to prove his endurance ability, which makes him lose credibility in my eyes."
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,maturoto,6,Thu Apr 30 13:43:22 2015 UTC,"What are his PRs actually? Marathon, 50 mile, 100 km, 100 mile?  Anything impressive? I don't think he should call himself ""hybrid athlete"" (if that's what he does call himself) unless he can run a marathon under 3 hours and still have good lifts. The way he looks he doesn't look hybrid at all, but like a lifter who maybe runs a bit, but he definitely doesn't look like a good runner.   I'd be happy to be proven wrong.  Edit:   One mile / 1650m: 4:15 Two mile: 10:35 5k: 17:18 – as you can see, my running speed slows dramatically over distance! 1/2 marathon: 1:31 Marathon: I haven’t done a full marathon in over six years, back when I first started this form of training. Back then, the best I ever achieved was a 4:00:00 finish amidst three stress fractures, which goes to show the perils of poor programming! 50 miler: 9:38   (Source for all)  Fair enough - impressive times for one and two miles, good 5k time, but from the half marathon up not very impressive for someone who calls himself and endurance runner AND sells books on this. Impressive for his size and weight though, and props for even competing!"
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,Gabbar99,6,Fri Apr 3 22:45:21 2015 UTC,"A couple months before that interview that he claimed he'd done a 3:35 marathon: in comments at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBCHlXFB7gQ  A year before that he said ""I currently run a 4:23 mile, have done 4 marathons, 1 Ultramarathon, 1 Ironman triathlon, and 1 half Ironman in the last three years"" http://chaosandpain.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/time-to-stir-that-pot-refutation-of.html?zx=dc1ba61ac857e7cf  So his marathon claims vary depending on when he's asked. His best official marathon is 4:17 and best official 5k is 26 minutes (years ago, he's right that you shouldn't judge him on that time).  On Facebook last fall he said he ran a 16:05 5k.  As always, a secret by himself run, not an official race.  He's never done an official one mile, two mile, or half marathon.  He did do two official 50 milers in 11:42 and 12:16."
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,maturoto,5,Thu Apr 9 18:38:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for clearing this up!! Wow, okay, so all those claims are not backed up by race times? Then they are worthless, anyone can claim anything.  So his running PRs are:   5K: 26 minutes (not impressive at all; If he doesn't want to be judged by this, he can just run another race.) Marathon: 4:17 50 mile: 11:42   None of these times is overly impressive for a guy who trains a lot. And they are embarassing for someone who claims to be good at this and publishes books on the subject. (A 4-hour marathon or running a 50 miler is a great accomplishment for an average runner, but this average runner probably wouldn't write a book about it.)  Just to make things clear: Very impressive that a strong guy runs a lot and finishes ultramarathons, but he is in now way a great runner and definitely not a ""hybrid athlete"", rather a lifter who runs."

AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,jam97322,2,Sat Apr 11 00:41:58 2015 UTC,"1650 meters is not a mile. A mile is actually 1609 although 4 laps around a standard 400m track is 1600 even. So if he ran 1650 his mile should be even faster!  Paces for the lazy:   1mile=4:08 2mile=5:17 5k=5:34 Half Marathon=6:56 Marathon=9:09 50mile=11:33 (probably on a trail)   The difference between the 2mile and 5k are exactly what you would expect from an experienced runner, the rest is a joke."

AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,dyllos,7,Fri Apr 10 16:24:41 2015 UTC,Whatever. The guy improved my workouts in every way when he coached me.
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,failon,14,Fri Apr 10 20:55:11 2015 UTC,"See, this is the kind of stuff I'm interested in. I try to reserve judgment and don't want to get involved with either side of the Viada circlejerk, but I also feel that neither Chad or Greg would tolerate him if he was a shitty coach.  Can you give us some examples of the stuff he'd work with you on, compared to typical approaches?"
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,dyllos,12,Sat Apr 4 01:47:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not the best example of a success story because my goal wasn't endurance but I did run a lot of 400's and 800's. Basically strength days would be lower or upper. Usually working towards 95-105% of a 1rm Max in either squat, bench, or dead. Then accompanying work. So on squat days it might be work up to 95%, 1-2 set of 3 with 80%, 3xmax clean reps front squats with prescribed weight, cleans, then maybe rowing, or running. The next day may be some oly lifting (which I hate), and some conditioning, some days were all endurance, rowing 5000m for time, running 3-5 miles etc. generally it was a lot more cardio than I would program if someone came to me as a coach but it worked. I was amazed at what my deadlift was doing. I switched because I as a coach love to learn as much as possible and seeing other coaches train me makes me better at my job."
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,Clean_n_Press,2,Sat Apr 4 04:14:34 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on the 105%? Eccentric reps?  Genuinely curious.
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,dyllos,1 point,Sat Apr 4 13:35:23 2015 UTC,"No, you'd hit a new max. There was a point when I was hitting 10lb pr's for my deadlift for 4 straight weeks."

AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,HoldTheJalapenos,1 point,Sun Apr 5 21:51:44 2015 UTC,I wasnt questioning his lifting ability.  I just found out about him after coming from a running background and discovered that he never backs up his running claims.  I think he also is a little dodgy about competing in lifting competitions? But I will admit I am less sure about that.
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,gobtacular,10,Sat Apr 4 04:44:43 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical when it comes to Alex Viada. If the numbers he provides are true he would be willing to prove them, but I haven't seen any substantial proof. He is always injured.

AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,HoldTheJalapenos,7,Sat Apr 4 13:00:10 2015 UTC,"What numbers specifically? I work out in the same gym as Alex and have seen him put up some impressive weight. I don't think he'll be setting any powerlifting records, but given what he puts his body through with his whole training regimen, he's pretty damn strong. I agree that he does seem often injured, though."
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,gobtacular,8,Sat Apr 4 03:14:26 2015 UTC,"The power lifting and endurance PR numbers! He talks about it a lot, but I haven't seen him actually record himself doing it or showing proof from a power lifting meet or an official race. No offense, but I'm going to trust a random Reddit account either. I'm going to remain skeptical until I see some actual proof."
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,HoldTheJalapenos,8,Sat Apr 4 03:46:47 2015 UTC,"I understand your skepticism. Feel free to ignore me for lack of credibility, I'm just some guy. But for what it's worth, I spotted him squatting 585 beltless and without wraps a few weeks back, and I've seen him bench 425. I haven't seen him deadlift in a long while, but here is a video of him pulling 700, albeit not in a competition. So I haven't seen him approach the 705/465/700 referenced here, but those were just casual training days. I don't doubt that he has hit those numbers. Obviously you're still welcome to doubt him, just thought I'd weigh in.  Can't speak at all to his endurance PRs. Just that he came in with a super torn-up shoulder last fall because he fell off his bike. It was gross."
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,heart_of_gold1,5,Sat Apr 4 03:50:08 2015 UTC,"That dead lifting video is exactly what I'm looking for. Now there is no doubt he is strong on the dead lift, but can a guy who barely pulls 700lbs on the dead lift also squat 700lbs and run a 4:45 mile? I'm glad you understand my skepticism because those are insane numbers and are hard to believe without proof. If he really wants to promote himself and his online training services he should be posting these insane videos so he can get more clients and fans."
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,jam97322,6,Sat Apr 4 04:43:06 2015 UTC,Really I think there are enough people (myself for one) with squats equivalent to or higher than deadlifts that I would trust the claim of squatting 700lbs in good knee sleeves from someone who can deadlift 700 lbs.

AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,Gabbar99,2,Sun Apr 5 19:58:00 2015 UTC,Im a powerlifter with 600lb+ squat and deadlift and i enjoy running. Let me tell you the ranges that suit someone who carries this much muscle are mile and marathon. My 5k absolutely sucks compared to my mile and even 10k. We can keep a good pace up for a short time or we can shuffle along efficiently enough. A 5k is the worst possible distance. Just too much resource sucking muscle and too heavy. Im 220lbs fairly lean. My mile is in the high 6 range but no way can i get below a 25 min 5k.

He claims impossible numbers but never enters races.  You can argue whether the numbers are possible or not, but bottom line is that there are races in his town every week that he could enter and prove them if they were true.  He has no official results ever showing him to be even a better than average runner."
AdvancedFitness,31cfn3,selfcrit,5,Wed Apr 8 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"The mile time claims always seem a little far fetched so I'd like to see evidence of that.

I'm 205 pounds, can lift heavy and yet I can do mma for 5 rounds, play 90 minutes of soccer and my last mile run was 5:29.   I think a lot of people focus too much on either endurance or strength without realizing both are where it's at."

AdvancedFitness,319cqd,MHmijolnir,58,Fri Apr 3 01:06:57 2015 UTC,"SEAL training is meant to break you. It's meant to weaken you. Most of its mental - low intensity pain over every instant of time for a very long time. Shit that makes sane people lose their minds. Shit that eats away at your Psyche and makes you doubt yourself. Simply being in pain. The lack of nutrition and sleep mentioned by others factors into this. It's all meant to weaken you. The majority of it is mental, a lot of it is still physical. Shit like falling asleep during a run. Or sitting in freezing irritating sandy surf for hours. Ultimately, they want to find the people driven and stubborn and smart enough to function without sleep and despite their deteriorating bodies, the people able to convince themselves to keep going despite tremendous amounts of stress. They recruit those people. You come out of SEAL or MARSOC or RANGER Training physically WEAKER, but mentally you know you've endured things that 99.9% of other people will never do. And that gives you confidence for the future."
AdvancedFitness,319cqd,boojieboy,6,Fri Apr 3 02:10:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly: the SEAL training OP is referencing here is not training per se, but more of a selection process. The idea is you start with a bunch of already pretty tough candidates (but with unknown physical and mental reserves) and you push them into zones where they have to access those reserves, until people exceed their reserves and start dropping out. They expect some ungodly attrition rate, probably on the order of 80% failure. What you're left with at the end aren't a bunch of stronger people, but people who already had the mettle to tough it out, to a degree beyond those who drop out. The training that restores and expands their physical strength comes later.  I would expect though that these elite units may allow people to have multiple attempts at the selection process, and that many of the candidates who succeed require two or three tries before they make it. EDIT: It'd be great if someone could come and supply actual facts to my speculations in this regard."

You gain a lot of knowledge about specific techniques needed in the field but your sleep is poor and nutrition is just as bad. Most people suffer injuries and lose lbs and lbs of muscle.

The literature says recovery is just as important as the training bout, overtraining doesn't really exist physiologically if all other stressors are taken away and the hot shit right now has to do with disruptions in sleep cycles and how they result in a chronic state of inflammation which of course is directly attributed to disease and fatigue/injury."

Additionally, even with the standard supplementation of 5g/day, you're going to increase what is filtered out in the urine dramatically and still see a rise in serum creatinine.

Optimized dietary strategies to protect skeletal muscle mass during periods of unavoidable energy deficit Stefan M. Pasiakos1, Lee M. Margolis and Jeb S. Orr + Author Affiliations  Military Nutrition Division, U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Natick, Massachusetts, USA ↵1Correspondence: Military Nutrition Division, U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, 15 Kansas St., Bldg. 42, Natick, MA 01760, USA. E-mail: stefan.pasiakos@usarmy.mil  Next Section Abstract  Interactions between dietary protein and energy balance on the regulation of human skeletal muscle protein turnover are not well described. A dietary protein intake above the recommended dietary allowance during energy balance typically enhances nitrogen retention and up-regulates muscle protein synthesis, which in turn may promote positive protein balance and skeletal muscle accretion. Recent studies show that during energy deficit, muscle protein synthesis is down-regulated with concomitant increases in ubiquitin proteasome-mediated muscle proteolysis and nitrogen excretion, reflecting the loss of skeletal muscle mass. However, consuming high-protein diets (1.6–2.4 g/kg per day), or high-quality, protein-based meals (15–30 g whey) during energy deficit attenuates intracellular proteolysis, restores muscle protein synthesis, and mitigates skeletal muscle loss. These findings are particularly important for physically active, normal-weight individuals because attenuating the extent to which skeletal muscle mass is lost during energy deficit could prevent decrements in performance, reduce injury risk, and facilitate recovery. This article reviews the relationship between energy status, protein intake, and muscle protein turnover, and explores future research directives designed to protect skeletal muscle mass in physically active, normal-weight adults.—Pasiakos, S. M., Margolis, L. M., and Orr, J. S. Optimized dietary strategies to protect skeletal muscle mass during periods of unavoidable energy deficit.  leucine military mTORC1 lean body mass Dietary energy and protein intake are nutritional determinants of skeletal muscle mass. Maintenance of skeletal muscle mass is generally achieved by consuming sufficient energy to meet energy demand and protein at levels consistent with the U.S. recommended dietary allowance (RDA; 0.8 g/kg per day) (1). However, during periods of increased energy demand, protein requirements to sustain protein retention and the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass are increased above the RDA. It is currently recommended that physically active individuals (e.g., aerobic and resistance exercise type athletes) consume 1.2 to 1.7 g protein/kg per day (2⇓–4). Likewise, it is recommended that military personnel undergoing metabolically challenging training and combat operations consume a diet providing 1.5 to 2.0 g/kg per day of protein to facilitate the repair of damaged proteins, synthesis of new muscle proteins, and maintenance of muscle mass (5). Therefore, it is not surprising that high-protein diets have increased in popularity among physically active, normal-weight adults (3).  In general, overweight and obese individuals adhering to a sustained, moderate energy-deficient diet lose fat and lean body mass (LBM), which approximates 75% fat mass and 25% LBM (6). However, decrements in LBM can be more severe in normal-weight individuals, such as athletes and military personnel, who often undergo unavoidable energy deficits of greater severity (7). The loss of LBM in active populations can lead to degraded performance and increased injury risk (8, 9). Fortunately, protein intake above the RDA is skeletal muscle protective, as studies have consistently shown that consuming protein at twice the RDA spares LBM and that this metabolic advantage is independent of body size (6, 7, 10⇓–12).  Although the independent effects of dietary energy and protein intake on body composition have been studied extensively, and potential energetic, endocrine, and the behavioral mechanisms to account for body composition adaptations to energy and protein manipulations have been explored (13⇓⇓–16), the interaction between energy status and protein intake on skeletal muscle protein turnover and associated regulatory systems remains largely unexplored (7, 17⇓⇓⇓⇓–22). Given that muscle protein turnover, especially muscle protein synthesis (MPS), is a primary regulator of skeletal muscle mass (23) and that the stimulatory effects of dietary protein on MPS are well documented (24⇓–26), the lack of studies in this area of nutritional science is intriguing. Recent studies from our group (7, 20) and others (17) have provided consistent data demonstrating interactive effects of energy and protein on muscle protein turnover. This article highlights the molecular and nutritional regulation of skeletal muscle mass with emphasis given to recent studies establishing a mechanistic link between energy and protein intake on muscle protein turnover, and it proposes new research to identify appropriate nutritional strategies to mitigate skeletal muscle loss during energy deficit.  Previous Section Next Section Molecular regulation of human skeletal muscle protein turnover Skeletal muscle protein turnover is a dynamic process that encompasses the synthesis of new proteins and breakdown of existing proteins. The rate of muscle protein turnover is dependent on amino acid availability and endogenous protein breakdown (26, 27). Cycling of amino acids between MPS and muscle protein breakdown (MPB) is critical for growth, maintenance, and repair of body tissues, which facilitate adaptation and recovery from physical stressors (25). Dysregulation of muscle protein turnover can contribute to the progression of LBM loss (28⇓–30).  Skeletal muscle protein turnover is regulated by intracellular anabolic (23) and proteolytic systems (31). Cellular regulation of MPS is mediated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (32, 33). Energy status and protein intake modulate mTORC1 signaling, mRNA translation, and ultimately MPS (32, 33). Specifically, energy deprivation up-regulates AMP-activated protein kinase, thereby diminishing mTORC1 signaling and MPS (34). However, consuming protein either alone or in a mixed-macronutrient meal promotes a robust increase in MPS (35, 36). The anabolic response to protein ingestion occurs as a result of postprandial increases in extracellular amino acid availability (26, 37), insulin secretion (38), and muscle intracellular amino acid transporter expression (39). This sequence leads to increased muscle intracellular amino acid levels, which in turn stimulates mTORC1 and downstream activation of p70 S6 kinase and inactivation of the repressor of mRNA translation, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (40⇓⇓⇓–44). Dietary protein sources that contain high levels of the branched-chain amino acid leucine are particularly effective at increasing MPS. The effectiveness of leucine seems to stem from interactions with the Rag subfamily of Rag small GTPases and subsequent lysosomal translocation of mTORC1 (43, 44).  MPB provides amino acid precursors to sustain MPS and support hepatic gluconeogenesis (45⇓–47). Four proteolytic systems contribute to MPB, including the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), autophagy-lysosomal, calcium-dependent calpains, and the cysteine protease caspase enzymes (48, 49). The UPS is the primary mechanism by which skeletal muscle is degraded (31, 50). The UPS is a highly regulated, irreversible process that involves energy-dependent ubiquitylation of muscle proteins through a discrete series of reactions catalyzed by 3 distinct enzyme complexes. This process begins with calpain and caspase 3–dependent myofibril cleavage, resulting in smaller, more accessible actomyosin fragments (51, 52). These fragments are then marked for degradation by covalent binding of multiple ubiquitin molecules catalyzed by the enzymes E1 (ATP-dependent ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin-ligating enzymes). The polyubiquitin chain is recognized by the 26S proteasome, a large multisubunit proteolytic complex consisting of a central catalytic core (20S proteasome) and 2 terminal regulator complexes (19S complexes). The 19S regulator complex plays a central role in the recognition and unfolding of the ubiquitylated proteins and guides them to the 20S catalytic core for subsequent protein hydrolysis. Activity and expression of the UPS is up-regulated under conditions of metabolic stress and is thought to be regulated in part through the insulin-mediated mTORC1 intracellular signaling pathway (53).  Nutritional regulation of human skeletal muscle protein turnover The quantity of dietary protein consumed dictates the activation of MPS. There is a dose-dependent relationship between dietary protein and MPS, and consuming a 20 to 25 g serving (or 0.25 to 0.30 g protein/kg meal or 2.5 g leucine) of high-quality protein maximally stimulates postprandial MPS for approximately 2 hours (54, 55). When higher doses of protein or leucine are consumed, there is an accompanying increase in protein oxidation with no additional anabolic stimulus (56, 57). The mechanisms limiting MPS stimulation remain unclear, but may include reduced amino acid uptake due to negative feedback regulation of amino acid transporter expression (35, 39)."
AdvancedFitness,3148l2,piratelax40,10,Wed Apr 1 23:48:08 2015 UTC,"Enriching smaller doses of high-quality protein and essential amino acids with leucine—or, in the case of older adults, consuming more total protein—potentiates postprandial mTORC1 signaling and MPS during conditions of metabolic stress (58), age-related anabolic resistance (59⇓–61), and during recovery from endurance and resistive-type exercise (62⇓⇓–65). Metabolic stressors, such as energy restriction, may circumvent factors limiting MPS during energy balance. Findings from Areta et al. (17) provide support for this hypothesis, as increasing total protein (15 to 30 g whey protein) intake after exercise resulted in a progressive increase in postprandial MPS during energy deficit. Recent evidence also suggests that distribution of daily protein intake can modulate MPS (66). Specifically, distributing protein equally across meals, rather than the more traditional, skewed intake of daily protein, extends postprandial MPS (67), which may contribute to long-term regulation of skeletal muscle mass by limiting the duration to which skeletal muscle is in a net catabolic state (68). Although these studies provide valuable insight regarding the quantity and distribution of protein intake on MPS, it is important to reemphasize the importance of protein quality, as lower-quality proteins (i.e., those lower in leucine) may not be as effective in potentiating MPS under such conditions (69).  Kinetic and intracellular assessments of MPB have produced inconsistent, limited data (31). The lack of reproducible data in this area is likely due to methodological limitations (70) and the relative small contribution of MPB to the regulation of skeletal muscle mass in healthy individuals (31). Some studies have shown that protein consumption and the secondary hyperinsulinemia attenuate postresistance exercise MPB (71⇓–73). However, others have shown that provision of exogenous amino acids can up-regulate MPB (74) or may have minimal-to-no impact on MPB, at least when consumed at rest or before or after exercise (57, 75⇓⇓–78). We demonstrated increased postabsorptive MPB and UPS-related gene expression after short-term (10 days) and prolonged (21 days) energy deficit (18, 19). However, consumption of a protein-containing, mixed-meal attenuated 26S proteolytic activity during energy deficit (18). A better understanding of the intracellular regulatory mechanisms of MPB will be necessary to fully understand the complex pathways modulating skeletal muscle mass in populations susceptible to severe muscle loss resulting from nutritional deprivation.  Previous Section Next Section RECENT RESULTS  High-protein diets attenuate decrements in muscle protein synthesis and protect skeletal muscle mass during energy deficit The extent to which energy deficit modulates protein turnover and LBM is largely due to the degree and duration to which energy intake is deficient. At the whole-body level, acute energy deficiency results in an increase in proteolysis, amino acid oxidation, and nitrogen excretion, which becomes less pronounced and plateaus over time (79⇓⇓⇓–83). This adaptive mechanism to spare protein during prolonged energy deficit was demonstrated by Ancel Keys nearly 70 years ago (84⇓–86). Despite dramatic advances in analytical capabilities, there have been few studies that have examined actual skeletal muscle adaptation to energy deficit (7, 17, 20⇓–22).  Our laboratory has conducted a number of studies where dietary protein was manipulated to better understand the control of muscle protein turnover during energy deficit (7, 18⇓–20). In normal-weight, physically active adults, we demonstrated that short-term (10 days), moderate energy deficit (500 kcal per day) attenuates postabsorptive MPS by 19% with concomitant reductions in mTORC1 signaling (20). Postabsorptive MPB and intracellular markers of muscle proteolysis were also increased in response to short-term energy deficit (19). Although these findings have not been confirmed, increased muscle proteolysis during short-term energy deficit is consistent with studies demonstrating up-regulated whole-body proteolysis in the early stages of energy deficit (80). The observed decrements in MPS were recently confirmed by Areta et al. (17), who reported a 27% reduction in postabsorptive MPS in a similar population of physically active, normal-weight adults in response to a 5 day moderate energy deficit.  We also observed that when total daily protein intake is consistent with the RDA, sustained energy deficit over 21 days blunts postprandial MPS responses to an optimal serving of high-quality protein (20 g milk protein) (7). In contrast, a diet providing 2 and 3 times the RDA for protein spared postprandial MPS responses to the same 20 g serving of protein with simultaneous reductions in UPS-mediated muscle proteolysis (7, 18). Individuals consuming protein at levels 2 and 3 times the RDA also lost 43% less LBM than those consuming RDA levels under identical experimental conditions (7, 18). Areta et al. (17) also demonstrated that consuming high-quality, protein-based meals (15 to 30 g whey) in combination with resistance exercise restored MPS above levels observed during energy balance and did so in a dose-dependent manner. These data emphasize the link among protein turnover, total dietary protein intake, and protein consumed at each meal on the regulation of skeletal muscle mass during energy deficit. Interestingly, a diet providing 3 times the RDA rather than twice the RDA offered no further advantages during moderate energy deficit (1000 kcal per day), as protein oxidation was increased (83), with no additional protection of LBM (7). That said, we suspect that higher levels of dietary protein (more than twice RDA) may be advantageous in some situations, as we recently showed. Soldiers consuming 1.7 g protein/kg per day failed to retain whole-body protein during metabolically challenging, short-term military training that produced extreme energy deficits (∼3400 kcal per day) (87).  Previous Section Next Section FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUSION  Our laboratory is currently answering the practical question—would the addition of protein-containing snacks to daily protein intake accelerate recovery of LBM after unavoidable energy deficit? A driver for this work is the unique occupational situations of our target population, who have goals and requirements distinct from the general public. Our nutritional questions are, to an extent, similar to athletic populations, and although overlap exists, military personnel are not competitive athletes who train and compete under optimal conditions. Rather, they operate in austere environments and in situations where the ability to eat ebbs and flows. Moreover, they have to deal with stressors common to combat operations (e.g., energy deficit, sleep deprivation, and sustained load carriage). Studies on students participating in military training courses and sustained operations exercises lasting 3.5 to 64 days have reported weight losses ranging from 3 to 16% of initial body mass (88⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–97). More importantly, LBM accounted for, on average, over 50% of the total mass lost, which highlights the disparity between military personnel and their civilian counterparts, who experience similar reductions in total body mass with generally no appreciable decrement in LBM (98, 99).  Despite evidence to support an increase in dietary protein intake for LBM preservation during energy deficit (6, 7, 10⇓–12), no studies have established dietary protein requirements during simulated or real-world military operations. We recently observed that soldiers consuming 1.7 g protein/kg per day failed to retain whole-body protein during a 7 day military training exercise (87). Therefore, it is clear that recommendations for 1.2 to 1.7 g protein/kg per day (and perhaps up to 2.0 g protein/kg per day) may be population specific, and there is likely no amount of protein that will completely offset the catabolic state induced by military operational stress and severe energy deficits (100). Thus, the primary goal operational feeding should be to minimize energy deficits and provide adequate levels of protein to spare LBM (5, 7). Identifying the point at which further manipulations in the quantity, type, and pattern of protein intake begins to augment rates of protein oxidation with no discernible impact on protein retention and LBM will be critical for defining how to most effectively use protein in combat rations."
AdvancedFitness,3148l2,piratelax40,9,Thu Apr 2 00:40:39 2015 UTC,"The dramatic reductions in anabolic hormones, such as testosterone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), that occur during severe energy deficit could diminish the magnitude by which manipulating protein intake spares LBM. However, the contribution of testosterone and IGF-1 in the control of MPS and regulation of LBM remain unclear. In healthy young men, the suppression of endogenous testosterone production has myriad adverse physiologic consequences, including decreased LBM, increased adiposity, and decreased muscle strength (101⇓⇓–104). Finkelstein et al. (102) recently demonstrated that decreases in testosterone levels from 530 to 350 ng/dl result in increased adiposity, and further reductions to ≤200 ng/dl are accompanied by skeletal muscle atrophy and decreased muscle strength. Importantly, numerous studies report that testosterone decreases this magnitude during military training and sustained operations and is associated with concomitant decreases in LBM (90, 105⇓⇓–108). IGF-1 concentrations are sensitive to perturbations in energy balance as well. During various military training courses and studies designed to simulate operational stress, significant decrements in IGF-1 concentrations occur, and there is accompanying loss of LBM (89, 90, 106, 108, 109). Although dietary manipulations have to date proven to be unsuccessful at mitigating the endocrine response to negative energy balance (101, 124-126), pharmacologic interventions that restore anabolic hormone concentrations have been shown to promote nitrogen retention despite energy deficit (110⇓–112). Further research is required to determine whether interventions, such as testosterone replacement, can attenuate decrements in LBM during military operational stress. Additionally, future studies are needed to investigate the interaction between endocrine status and the LBM-sparing effect of increased dietary protein intake.  Relatively little is known about individual responsiveness to dietary protein manipulations and the impact of underfeeding. An important first step will be identifying factors underlying the large interindividual variability with respect to the magnitude of LBM change during energy deficit. Such variability is exemplified by the wide range of changes observed in soldiers during U.S. Army Ranger school, where weight loss ranged from 9 to 23% (6.5 to 20.6 kg) of initial body mass, with a LBM loss of 0.3 to 13.8 kg (113). Interestingly, baseline adiposity accounted for 86% of the variance in fat loss but only 20% of the change in LBM. Studies conducted using monozygotic twins indicate that testosterone may assist with preservation of LBM during energy deficit and lessen adipose tissue accrual during energy surplus (13, 114). More recently, advanced genomic and transcriptomic analyses have been used to elucidate the genetic and molecular basis for individual skeletal muscle responses to resistance and endurance exercise training (115⇓⇓⇓–119). Surprisingly, transcriptional patterns consistent with suppressed mTORC1 activity were observed in individuals displaying the greatest hypertrophic response to resistance training (117). The application of these techniques holds promise for furthering our understanding of the interindividual variability in skeletal muscle responses to operational stress.  Although recent studies provide a mechanistic link between dietary protein, skeletal muscle protein turnover, and the regulation of muscle mass during energy deficit, there are several important questions that remain unanswered. Is there a dose-dependent relationship between the amount of protein consumed and the severity of the energy deficit imposed? Does MPS become saturated at the same level of protein during energy deficit as energy balance? To what extent does manipulating both the level and pattern of protein intake augment the maintenance of LBM during energy deficit and facilitate the accretion of LBM during recovery? Last, what accounts for the apparently large interindividual difference in LBM loss during energy deficit, and how does this impact dietary recommendations and/or protein requirements for populations susceptible to muscle loss? In addition to providing insight regarding the interactions between energy status and muscle protein turnover, future studies designed to address these questions will play an integral role in developing targeted nutritional interventions to optimize skeletal muscle mass in physically active, normal-weight adults.

These findings are particularly important for physically active, normal-weight individuals because attenuating the extent to which skeletal muscle mass is lost during energy deficit could prevent decrements in performance, reduce injury risk, and facilitate recovery. This article reviews the relationship between energy status, protein intake, and muscle protein turnover, and explores future research directives designed to protect skeletal muscle mass in physically active, normal-weight adults."

AdvancedFitness,313hf8,Furthur,10,Mon Apr 6 22:13:11 2015 UTC,"This study says that fast food is as effective as popular supplements for glycogen recovery for a single workout, which is only one component of recovery.  This does not mean that fast food is not bad for you.  ""Popular supplements"" also are not anything special.  A big spoon full of sugar will do the same thing.  So will a banana.  A banana can actually have faster glycogen recovery because it has a 2:1 ratio of glucose:fructose, which matches the ratio of transport for multiple transportable carbohydrates (MTCs).  There is not a stupidly high emphasis on how bad fast food is for you.  It is horrible for you, and kills you slowly.  Someone with any interest in their health should always avoid fast food.  It is not an effective long-term strategy for exercise recovery due to the health detriments, which will eventually affect performance.  Saying otherwise at this point should be considered as ridiculous as saying smoking cigarettes ""isn't that bad"" or that sitting down all day is good for you.  EDIT: Studies showing health detriments of fast food (focused on showing studies that consider more than just caloric intake): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25622477 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25265504 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23317511 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25439182 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25319744 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24939238 http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/1/112.short http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.2004.10719357#.VRxhbPzF-So http://fastfoodmarketing.org/media/FastFoodFACTS_Report_Summary_2010.pdf http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/25/12/2451.short  How am I in /r/AdvancedFitness and not a single other person is citing studies?

AdvancedFitness,313hf8,Fit-Kucheka,6,Wed Apr 1 21:03:05 2015 UTC,"You cannot compare these results to saying cigarettes aren't that harmful and sitting down all day is good for you. The whole point of this article is to talk about fast food vs. supplements in the context of recovery. It makes no assertions about fast food consumption during any other metabolic state.  And going beyond glycogen recovery, the RCS article in my other comment states,    Cramer found no difference in insulin, glucose, cholesterol, or triglyceride levels   This brings up the idea that, maybe, just maybe, fast food isn't so bad for you when consumed in a glycogen-depleted state. So when you say   Someone with any interest in their health should always avoid fast food.   that is too black-and-white of a statement. Sure, a long-term fast food-based diet is detrimental, nobody (well, nobody here at least) will argue with that, but this article is pointing out that in certain instances, it may be okay."
AdvancedFitness,313hf8,Fit-Kucheka,5,Wed Apr 1 21:22:38 2015 UTC,"My first paragraph was addressing the study specifically, whereas the second paragraph was about fast food more generally without reference to the study.  Saying ""fast food is good for glycogen recovery"" is like saying ""smoking is good for weight loss.""  It is, but that doesn't mean that you should do it.  My second paragraph was pointing out that although I recognized fast food as being equally effective as restoring glycogen, it should not be consumed for that purpose because of other negative effects on health.  In the context of weight loss, I still would not smoke cigarettes.  Also important is that exercise recovery is not exclusively dictated by glycogen recovery.  I would not expect an acute change in any of those parameters from a single eating.  Metabolic diseases take a very long time to present.  That is also not a comprehensive investigation into the health effects of food (no investigation into DNA damage, etc).  I'm not saying absolutely never eat fast food, but assuming that fast food is ""okay"" in certain metabolic states could lead to someone eating that food every time they're in that metabolic state.  Assuming someone trains at least three times a week, that's three fast food meals per week, which is the threshold for fast food having a negative effect on health.  If you are a person who must eat fast food, after exercise would definitely be the time to do it, but I would encourage working towards eating less fast food.  Also consider that by purchasing their product, you are further enabling a company to produce a product for less educated people who would consume fast food while not in a glycogen depleted state."

AdvancedFitness,313hf8,Pejorativez,2,Wed Apr 1 21:08:34 2015 UTC,"The high amounts of fat and sugar found in fast food can lead to insulin resistance.   Elevated levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides in the blood stream and tissues have been found in many studies to contribute to diminished insulin sensitivity.[12][22][23][24]   Several recent authors suggested that the intake of simple sugars, and particularly fructose, is also a factor that contributes to insulin resistance.[28][29] Fructose is metabolized by the liver into triglycerides, and, as mentioned above, tends to raise their levels in the blood stream. Therefore, it may contribute to insulin resistance through the same mechanisms as the dietary fat.   The body produces insulin, but the cells in the body become resistant to insulin and are unable to use it as effectively, leading to hyperglycemia  Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma. Chronic levels exceeding 7 mmol/l (125 mg/dl) can produce organ damage.[1]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperglycemia"

True, but I would argue that, on average, fast foods are going to have high sugar and fat ratios compared to protein, while whole foods will have more favorable ratios (+micronutrients).   Additionally, a meal that is high in both may fit the macro nutrient needs (i.e. IIFYM) of the day.    I agree that it's better to hit TDEE with fast food than to miss it, but the point regarding developing insulin resistance still stands. It isn't bad short term, but long term fast food consumption won't be good for the abovementioned reasons. But it also depends greatly on what kind of fast food one is consuming. For example a milkshake at McD or BK is ~70% sugar. That's like going on the express train to diabeetus city."

AdvancedFitness,313hf8,Fit-Kucheka,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:33:25 2015 UTC,"Re trans fats:  Replacements for Trans Fats—Will There Be an Oil Shortage?   Manufacturers use the process of hydrogenation to create trans fats in order to increase the shelf life of baked and fried foods. Ingestion of trans fats is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. A groundswell of public sentiment is causing regulatory bodies to ban the use of trans fats in foods. Alternatives to trans fats are needed now in order to preserve the freshness and provide an appealing texture of many packaged foods. As trans fats become phased out, there are eight types of approaches currently being developed to substitute for these fats as ingredients for baked and fried foods: (1) modified hydrogenation, (2) genetically modified seeds, (3) interesterification, (4) fractionation and blending, (5) butter and animal fat, (6) natural saturated oils, (7) natural unsaturated oils, and (8) fat substitutes. These alternatives to trans fats will require close scrutiny to ascertain whether they will also turn out to be linked with cardiovascular disease.   A run around looking at interesterification shows that there is a difference between healthy and obese individuals consuming, and also as E:16 and E:18 oil consumption is more than 8% of dietary calories (2) .  re ""healthy vs obese"" - Influence of interesterification of a stearic acid-rich spreadable fat on acute metabolic risk factors.   While postprandial TAG (plasma triacylglycerol) concentrations in non-obese subjects were not affected by fat treatment (P > 0.05), obese subjects had an 85% increase in TAGs with CIE (chemically interesterified) versus NIE (non-interesterified) (P < 0.05). The differences in TAG response between non-obese and obese subjects suggest that interesterification may affect healthy individuals differently compared to those already at risk for T2D and/or CVD.   re ""8% of dietary calories - Replacing trans fat: the argument for palm oil with a cautionary note on interesterification.   Levels between 8% energy (%E) and 12%E from 18:0 as interesterified fat (the typical diet provides about 2%E-4%E as 18:0 from natural fats) show the most effect. Detection of adverse effects would seem to start around 7%E-8%E as IE-18:0, but one can assume that effects are initiated, even if undetected, at a lower intake, similar to the situation with TFA. Thus, although an intake of 1%E to 4%E from IE-18:0 does not appear to influence lipoproteins, it is not necessarily the only system affected. The negative effects of IE-18:0 may be alleviated or masked by dilution with other fats, especially by adding 18:2-rich polyunsaturated oils to the diet. This is similar to the trans fat story, i.e., if a limited intake of TFA is heavily diluted with other oils, the consumption of TFA fails to be detected as an adverse effect."

Taleb also embraces the Paleo Diet, as the key to health. Whatever else they may be, his opinions are at least logically consistent.   A devotee of Art DeVany, the 75-year-old athletic guru, who also follows the Paleo Diet, both men eat only what our ancient ancestors could hunt or forage. For Taleb, this is to include the most important element of his theory, variation. Like all systems, he believes that our bodies need to maintain randomness in order to live.  He told the crowd, “We are part lion and part cow. The lion intermittently eats protein and fat, when it can hunt, and the cow steadily eats grass for nine hours a day.” According to this theory, intermittent fasting, and inconsistent meat intake are what our bodies are best evolutionarily suited to.  The author champions religion for the same reason. He is Orthodox and therefore is banned from eating proteins and fat on Friday and Wednesday. “Religion is beneficial because it forces us to randomize and vary our food intake, just as it forces you to vary your mood and place of worship.”   Dude, this guy is a straight up kook.

Listen to your body always, but I would argue a more consistent feeding cycle is more beneficial due to circadian entrainment.  This is the beauty of a fixed time-restricted feeding (IF) protocol. Much of the benefit simply comes from robust and consistent entrainment of the central clock (SCN, mainly entrained via light) with various peripheral clocks (entrained mainly by feed/fast cycles), whereby the majority of food intake is ingested in the active period. There's a solid amount of evidence to suggest that it's healthier/optimal, especially from studies examining insulin resistance, visceral (liver mainly) adiposity, and hormonal perturbations."

AdvancedFitness,30taor,drioqka,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"Devil's advocate here: couldn't one argue that it isn't optimizing training by having the focus on multiple parameters in a microcycle? According to undulated periodization training you can only focus on one parameter (gpp, strength, power, speed) per training cycle. Having one day a week devoted to dynamic lifting  (or speed as OP referenced) confuses your body's CNS when training a high-intensity parameter where high m/s of bar movement is not possible.   (Note: just playing devil's advocate for the sake of complete conversation, not that I necessarily agree 100% with periodization training unless they're elite athletes in specific sports training )"
AdvancedFitness,30taor,GodOfWineAndTitz,3,Tue Mar 31 12:27:41 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the ""confusing your body's CNS"".   In regards to the concept of Stress - Recovery - Adaptation, by adding speed days, which by definition are low intensity, and usually controlled volume, you allow your body to drop fatigue accumulated in either a volume session (ex: 5x5) or high intensity (5RM), while still practicing the movements and even performing ""active rest"".   There is a school of thought based on daily undulating periodization where there are three basic blocks of training, switched daily in a mesocycle (which can be a week long or a month long) depending on the goals.   Volume (hypertrophy), power (speed), strength (strength). My professor, Dr. Zourdos at FAU, spoke highly of such methods. And I believe it is a good intermediate program for barbell sports, although I don't see it used as frequently in sport training. In my eyes, the Texas method is similar to DUP, with a volume day on monday, wednesday being a power day, and friday being a strength day.   It should be noted that the Texas Method, an intermediate program, is designed to be adjusted and could even be seen as an introduction into periodization for the general population, powerlifters, and even weightlifters, since it requires you to manipulate volume and intensity over the course of a training block, usually weekly. I am personally using it now for the sport of Weightlifting."
AdvancedFitness,30taor,GodOfWineAndTitz,2,Tue Mar 31 13:23:34 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of research, specifically by Cal Dietz and Thibaudeau, in regards to the benefits of periodization and the negative effects of mixed training that is common in the states. I would recommend reading Dietz's book Triphasic which has a ton of information that explains it better than I ever could. To my understanding dynamic movements would not be considered active rest because due to the maximal effort nature of the movement they're the most taxing on your central nervous system which is the key component to training intensity  (having a fresh CNS). You'll need at least 48-72 hours between dynamic effort training"
AdvancedFitness,30taor,GodOfWineAndTitz,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:59:38 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean about taxing your CNS due to the maximal effort. I will admit I haven't considered that, though I still believe that the drop in intensity is less taxing on the CNS than the intent of performing maximal effort training. I could be wrong on this. Would anyone else chime in?   At my university, they use Triphasic training for sports, although I also admit I am not familiar with it. I will definitely add that book to my collection, thank you for the suggestion.   There is a lot of evidence against anything that resembles mix training, concurrent training, DUP, etc in sport performance. I feel that for barbell sports, or even an early intermediate (someone who can still make gains weekly, as opposed to a more advanced trainee), they are extremely appropriate from what I understand because of the ability to rapidly improve absolute strength.   However, I also realize that in an advanced individual, concurrent training is not optimal, and a more advanced form of periodization, such as block periodization, could be more optimal for increases in strength and sport performance."

This is because they are not useful for building strength and are very difficult to ensure you are actually doing quickly (as opposed to snatches and cleans, which must be done quickly).  It also strikes me as a pretty suboptimal way to facilitate recovery."
AdvancedFitness,30taor,austinb,2,Tue Mar 31 13:12:13 2015 UTC,"Here is what I read in the Practical Programming on the subject matter.   ""High intensity training, i.e. using a very high % of your force production capacity, is very productive but difficult to recover from in large doses. The most common way to generate maximal force is to use maximal weights - 3,2,1RMs. The problem with maximal weights is that it is extremely taxing and hard to recover from.... Another way to increase the number and efficiency of motor units recruited to generate force is to generate that force quickly and explosively, requiring the coordinated, simultaneous firing of high number of motor units...... This has advantages over using maximal weights: it allows far more reps to be done, practices with, and recovered from, and it can be used for long periods of time without injury due to the lighter weights involved and the reduced stress front he joints and connective tissue.""  I believe it could be considered active rest due to the relatively low intensity compared to a 5RM or a heavy 5X5. Assuming the volume is controlled and not ridiculous, i personally believe it could be a good way to manage fatigue. The reason I asked this question is because while I highly respect Rippetoe's opinion on training since he is very knowledgable and reasonable with his training methods, there are simply some things I don't agree with, such as using low bar squats for weightlifters.  I was curious to see whether the intention of doing a lower intensity exercise as fast as possible could really elicit a strength adaptation."
AdvancedFitness,30taor,fernando_69,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:19:29 2015 UTC,"Right, it definitely cannot elicit a strength adaptation (submaximal weights never do, even when used in a power fashion).  Force production is a superset of strength (also includes power/muscle recruitment, which is what you are training with submaximal loads at high speeds).  It probably is slightly useful for active recovery, but again I probably wouldn't be using deadlifts for active recovery.  I don't think it would be particularly useful in managing fatigue, I think you'd want to be considering volume/intensity mixes to do that, not going for power/speed DLs.  Not to rehash, but curious why you are against LB squats for weightlifters.  Is it because of the positioning or something else?"
AdvancedFitness,30smu0,T-MoneyAllDey,14,Mon Mar 30 11:02:29 2015 UTC,"I lift and run. It isn't some sort of kryptonite to your gains and lifting isn't some sort of danger to your running. Plus you're only talking like 5 miles.  Just like people (usually women) who fear lifting will make them bulky, running a few miles a couple days a week isn't going to make a 200lb powerlifter into a 160lb marathon runner.  If it were me I'd train with a plan if getting to ~8 miles on the long run. So three days a week run, t,r,s. Start at 1-2 miles and do long on sat. Week one 1,1,2. Week three go 2,2,2. Then 2,2,3. Build to 3,3,5 then 3,3,6 and eventaully 3,3,8 or any 4,4,8 if you like it. If you hate it barely build to 2,2,5 and hope the adrenaline of the event will make it easy for you. If you love it build to 4,3,4,8 where maybe you run 4 at easy pace on Tues and Thursday, and 3 at a fast pace on Wednesday. Then run 8 on Saturday at whatever pace. If you can do that two to three weeks before the relay you'll be passing people on race day.  Taper the week before, just kick back to 2-3 easy miles.  None if this is enough to impact your gains on weights. It's not like you're running 50 milers and your body will want to drop muscle and specialize in efficiency. All that will happen is mostly mental. You will train yourself to breathe over the course of 30-40 minutes. That's #1. You will train yourself to continue running when it hurts knowing/learning the difference between pain and fatigue (much like lifting). You will train your muscles to work as a background process like an engine.  It should only help with lifting and lifting should help with this is you plan it right."

I'm just starting to try to incorporate some strength training into my running (was powerlifter, then ironman, and not sure what I am now). Its tough to fit lower body into a strength routine. Running after leg day (immediately or the next day) is great to build up muscular endurance, but it'll be hard to run fast, it'll suck more, and your chance of injury goes up. Running before leg day is probably a better (and less injury prone) way to approach it, but your leg day might suffer, especially if you aren't used to running much.  Not much specific help, but I hope the perspective is useful."

As another poster mentioned above, if they were to theoretically increase the speed at which the repetitions were done, wouldn't that create a strong enough stress to create a strength adaptation?"
AdvancedFitness,30jcth,purecoconut,2,Mon Mar 30 15:19:02 2015 UTC,"The typical novice will make strength gains keeping the weight the same, but it won't be optimal -- they would make more progress by increasing weight frequently. I wouldnt recommend increasing speed for novices, the risk of injury is too high. Once they have more experience and have built a good amount of strength in muscles and tendons, then plyometrics can be a good addition, but novices are likely to sustain an injury that will keep them out of the gym for a week or two -- far from optimal."

AdvancedFitness,30bjgc,warriorscall,0,Thu Mar 26 13:27:54 2015 UTC,"I think you should start with cardio three times a week. As far as cardio is concerned the military does base a lot of what they practice on research, which is done by the DoD. Their goal is to create an effective combat force, and this especially goes for the Marines who's whole mission is centered around a strong, fit infantry fighting force. Cardio is extremely important for survival on the battle field, and so is weight training. The combination produces freakbeasts. If you go Camp Pendleton Marine Base you will find guys that are crazy swoll, but who also can run 3 miles in under 21 minutes.  They're not burning muscle, and their cardiovascular system is incredible. This is because Marines are trained to operate around a 3 mile fitness test (PFT) where an 8 min mile pace means you're considered a pussy.   I don't believe the physical requirements of the military are based on the thought...""What's best for my health/gym performance?""...   EDIT: The requirements of the Marines indeed will make you better in the gym, because having a strong cardiovascular system has been shown to increase performance in strength training, which leads to increased performance on the battlefield when you are carrying 100 lbs of gear and have to sprint several hundred meters during an assault on enemy forces.  Again, you can see this if you walk into any fitness center on Pendleton.   EDIT2: At the higher levels of the military (75th Ranger, Navy NSW/NSO, Air Force Special Tactics) the question ""what's best for my health/gym performance"" indeed comes to play very often. Gym performance is key to battlefield performance, among other factors. And if your health if fucked then you can't fight....and Uncle Sam wants his money's worth out of these guys!"

These joint capsules lose water as force is applied to them in order to spread the force across the surface of the joint. This force must be unloaded in order for fluid to return.

AdvancedFitness,305y6w,saiduck90,3,Tue Mar 24 19:20:57 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the types of exercises needed to work each of these muscles, as targeted as possible, will answer your question best.  Rectus Femoris can work great with lying leg extensions and sissy squats with the hips/thighs in a straight line. Here's a good video from Jim Cordova's site: http://www.jimcordova.com/videos/videos.php?id=22  The Vastus Lateralis is a big one on the outside of the leg. Something (which has jived with what I've read about it before, and heard from my bodybuilding buddies, and makes sense based on how I work my legs) is reflected in the following:  ""Vastus Lateralis can be emphasized by doing compound leg exercises with feet relatively close together. Trying to do Barbell Squats this way usually causes balance issues severe enough that by the time the load on the bar is reduced enough to enable you to stay upright, there's not enough resistance to promote any growth.  The answer is machine work, which will take balance issues out of the equation. Try Machine Hacks, V-Squats, and/or Smith Machine Squats with your feet out in front of your body enough that your knees don't travel too far past your toes, and your feet 6"" or so apart from each other. Start relatively light, and work your way up in weight as you get accustomed to the new positioning. VL is a large, strong muscle, and you'll probably find that you have to use heavy weight to get it to respond."" - http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=139901913&p=785393503&viewfull=1#post785393503  In addition, even wide-stance squatting can work the lateralis if you intentionally pull your knees apart harder. The medialis will try to pull your knees inward while you squat wide, and if they overpower the lateralis, your knees will ""buckle"" in a little bit.  Then the vastus medialis is worked by leg pressing with toes pointed (more) out, or doing squats with a much wider stance. Even sumo dead lifts (get your butt low, intentionally) will work them, with a wide stance. Extreme/deep knee flexion seems to also hit the medialis harder than other spots.  The intermedius gets worked in almost any direction. It probably involves more hip flexion than the rectus femoris, and the femoris is more involved in knee extension. That's my understanding, anyway.  I hope that my post helps."

Knees buckling on wide squats has nothing to do with the vastus medius. At all.  ""The intermedius gets worked in almost any direction. It probably involves more hip flexion than the rectus femoris, and the femoris is more involved in knee extension. That's my understanding, anyway.""  Only the rectus femoris crosses the hip. The intermedius originates on the femur itself."
AdvancedFitness,305y6w,tadawdy,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:36:30 2015 UTC,"Good to know.  I need to re-learn where the muscles connect.  Are you saying the medius doesn't do ANY work at all in a wide stance? Surely that, since wide is subjective (wide for me may be almost a goblet squat for someone else), how wide a stance is affects how much the medius is used (or not)... I'd argue that any time there's an attempt at knee flexion, it's used at least to some degree (even if it's small). I'd love to see the EMG readings for that, based on how wide.  Edit: here we go, at least on leg press, EMG comes out more lateralis work with a wider stance, and more medialis on narrow. http://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/legs-exercises/power-your-wheels-these-go-leg-moves"
AdvancedFitness,305y6w,versanick,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:44:10 2015 UTC,"There is activity of the medialis in a wide stance, for sure. The vastus medialis just isn't the reason for your knees buckling on the squat. There are several major contributors that dwarf anything going on with the vastus medialis. 1. The large mass descending between your feet will cause your femurs to internally rotate if unopposed. This is worse the wider you stand and the more hip flexion you go into. 2. Spreading your feet wide places your external rotators in a less favorable position to oppose internal rotation 3. high adductor activity 4. loss of dorsiflexion ROM 5. Last but not least: simply not knowing where your knees ought to be."

Also, describing what happens in people with a pain syndrome may tell you about the cause of the problem, but it's just as likely to tell you about the effects of PFPS.  PFPS can be effectively treated without targeting the knee whatsoever. Exercises focusing on proximal strength and stability (hip and core) are at least as effective as knee-oriented exercise. Probably best to combine the two.   Generally, the vastus medialis is said to be more involved in the last 15-20 deg of knee extension. Heavy deadlifts elicit high activity at lockout, for example.   In terms of squats, front squats are are actually similar to back squats in terms of muscle activity. They may (may!) involve greater vastus medialis activity."

I couldn't find much about water stored from a higher sodium intake (say some salty snack in the previous day). This is all I could find: ""Note that a 1,000 to 1,500 milligram sodium diet is extremely low in sodium. Thus, many familiar and convenient foods usually consumed would have to be temporarily excluded. Eating in fast-food outlets or other restaurants would be difficult. As a short-term strategy, reducing sodium intake to very low amounts can result in a temporary loss of fluid and a loss of 1 to 3 pounds (.45 to 1.4 kilograms) of water weight. ""  Here, they mention up to 6 pounds: http://www.leanhigh.com/weight-loss/tips/water-weight-loss-how-sodium-salt-affects-your-weight Full article link: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/21/11/1291.full.pdf  Therefore, let's assume a 90kg male, 50% muscle (a bit more than average). Let's assume 2% of glycogen stored by kg of muscle, that would leave us with 900g of glycogen in muscles alone. Add in 120g in the liver, and we get a total 1020g of glycogen. Yet again, we can  read that each gram of glycogen bounds from 3-4g of water. Let me keep going for upper bound values., 1020g of glycogen + 4080g of water bound to it. Add in 3kg from water retained due to sodium and we get a whopping 8,1kg of water+glycogen.  Want some validation on my calculations, my background is Aerospace Engineering.

Cramp - although I'm presuming you would have been able to tell that yourself 3. The result of you mentally knowing/acknowledging that you've hit your physical limit and that any effort from then on will not be at the same level.  4.

I get those as well on occasion, but I know when and why those occur.  Usually late in the summer racing in the heat.  So, when Glycogen or ATP stores are depleted, is it normal to have such a sensory cue?  I had it happen once as I was warming up for my big event of the year back in 2010.  My warmup wasn't very long.  During my last full-gas warmup effort I felt the zap/shock but I didn't think anything of it.  I do recall going really fast and thinking, ""I'm gonna PB (personal best) today.""  Then I sat down and recovered 20 minutes until my event...which was nowhere near the PB that I had prepped and peaked for.  I think that my warmup effort was the fastest of the year and the subsequent race effort was average at best.  This was when I first took notice of the sensation.  So, although it may be linked to depleted energy stores, I don't think I was depleted during my warmup for that event.  It was the first race of the day. I was fully fed and rested."

There are some things that need to be replaced once the body used up its stores of fuel. Rest and hydration only form part of the equation. A simple banana or something may be the missing piece of your puzzle.  Hey I also thought more about that 'zap' you mentioned - if you're putting down truly max efforts, you could be releasing some endorphins and getting a bit of an adrenaline kick.

AdvancedFitness,2zuz4a,Hipoglucido,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:01:29 2015 UTC,"Potentially. I'd just re-think your warm up slightly so that you're thinking about 'activating' the top end rather than 'working' it. If you were to graph your effort across a warm up and race and there was a 100% spike for over 10-15 seconds somewhere in there, chances are there wouldn't be a 110% or even another 100% spike 20 minutes later.

Maybe do one or two hard squat jumps just before the race to 'activate' the fast twitch fibers in your legs without really 'working' them.  Your mental ability to go full gas is enviable so make sure your body gets/has what it needs to leverage it when you race. Power lifters lift heavy weights in warm up behind a curtain - but they do their truly maximal effort in front of the judges when it counts.  Probably worth saying that in training, max is max. Don't hold back. Hurt yourself."

AdvancedFitness,2zps2n,TheTr00per,13,Fri Mar 20 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"And you arrived at what conclusion?   Generally speaking, the data behind concurrent strength and endurance training seems to point in the direction that either doesn't really hinder the other assuming a reasonable load that won't lead to overtraining. i.e., you can get both stronger and improve endurance simultaneously. This mainly applies to your average person, not elite athletes. I haven't read the articles you listed and I can't really imagine any detrimental effects of fasted endurance training assuming it's not in the ""extreme"" durations and that the individual isn't in an overall caloric deficit.   Once the body is depleted of glycogen, there will be a necessity to rely on other stores of energy, namely fat with minimal contribution of amino acids from muscle and other organs. Although the % of energy derived from amino acids is small, it does increase with duration.   It's really difficult to use studies that measure acute responses and generalizing it to chronic adaptations-which a lot of studies are for many financial and pragmatic reasons. It's just bad science to extend the reach of findings in such a manner and you find that this sort of mentality is pervasive in the fitness community, sadly.   Without knowing the precise conditions, it's hard to come to conclusions much less the general direction you want to go with this topic."
AdvancedFitness,2zps2n,Pull_a_ski,2,Fri Mar 20 18:40:31 2015 UTC,"Appears to be good for fat loss. Can be used to condition for events where glycogen gets depleted, possibly. Increases some stuff that comes from protein which could be associated with protein breakdown.   One interesting thing. It does not yield the same benefits for Men and Women. It is possible eating prior to running has better benefits<<< this one I don't get.   ""However, two indicators of muscle damage were elevated in the fasted training placebo group. Their myoglobin levels approached significance halfway through the exercise bout, and were significantly elevated 6 hours postexercise. Creatine kinase levels were also significantly elevated 24 hours postexercise."" this is for resistance training, not endurance. Do you understand exactly how protein kinase is an indicator of muscle damage, and whether it is bad in terms of preserving strength & hypertrophy?"
AdvancedFitness,2zps2n,Pull_a_ski,3,Sat Mar 21 01:02:48 2015 UTC,"Fat loss in the grand scheme of things is more dependent on calorie deficit rather than whether or not you're exercising fasted or fed. Sure, you're burning more fat as a necessity because your liver is depleted from the overnight fast (assuming this is exercise not too long after waking). Even then there's still a bunch of glycogen in your muscles (1-3k calories worth) so performance won't be affected until supplies run low or you're training in an already depleted state to begin with.   It's not uncommon for endurance athletes to train on a keto diet and carb up before an event. I'm not entirely sure how effective this is, though.   Whenever you see enzymes that are typically found inside the muscle cell in the blood, this is usually an indicator of cell damage. For example, do some really nasty eccentric exercise like downhill running and you'll see high levels of creatine kinase (amongst others). It's unsurprising that a weight training caused greater muscle damage due to the intensity of eccentric contractions when compared to endurance.   Shit, you cause muscle damage and you'll see a drop in force production, sometimes taking a week or two to fully recover depending on how excruciating the bout was. You're going to witness damage to muscle regardless, more so if you're detrained, novice, or unaccustomed to the load. It's the extent that matters here, not just a noticeable rise.   Good thing is your body adapts and stimulus A doesn't get you all shitty and sore after a while. High levels of protein kinases in the blood or excessive soreness... part of the same story which reflect a poor choice to and a reduced ability to produce force. With recovery and adequate diet, you'll ""supercompensate"" ie be stronger and bigger etc.   As far as preserving hypertrophy goes, I don't think it's something to worry about. Key things being providing adequate mechanical stimulus to maintain or increase hypertrophy and enough dietary protein and calories.   I can't see how there would be a difference between men and women, especially if diets are consistent.   I know this is all over the place and I apologize."

While true, this is pretty over-simplified. Concurrent training absolutely hinders improvement in power and RFD.   Running seems to be the worst offender, also significantly hindering strength gains. You still can train for strength, but progress will be slower"
AdvancedFitness,2zps2n,CuriouslyCultured,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:05:58 2015 UTC,"None of the concurrent training research I've seen controls caloric intake.  It is hard for me to take studies seriously when the resistance training only group increases total body weight while slightly reducing total fat mass, and the resistance+endurance training group has a greater reduction in total body mass than can be accounted for just from the calorie expenditure of endurance training.  To me, all this indicates is that endurance training is a potent appetite suppressant, and adequate calorie intake is required to realize optimal strength and hypertrophy gains."
AdvancedFitness,2zps2n,tadawdy,1 point,Sun Mar 22 18:48:10 2015 UTC,"This is a valid point regarding mass and strength, and cannot be entirely dismissed. You are right that in the subjects generally used in these studies (healthy, college-aged males), continuous exercise of the intensity used tends to suppress appetite.   What I DO find compelling is that cycling does not seem to exhibit nearly the same interference effect as running with regard to mass and strength, despite similar caloric demands. This, and the obvious differences between running and cycling, lead me to believe it is something intrinsic to the mode of exercise."
AdvancedFitness,2zps2n,CuriouslyCultured,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:49:02 2015 UTC,"I actually just finished doing a really deep dive on the study that everyone cites in regards to cycling vs walking a couple of days ago.  The biggest issue there is that the strength test they used (leg press) is biomechanically much more similar to cycling than steep incline walking.  Additionally, while it is true that quadriceps CSA was higher in the cycling group, there are a few other issues here.  For starters, the cycling group lost less total weight than the walking group. Secondly I would argue that cycling at the maximum resistance level where 60+ RPM can be maintained is likely to induce minor hypertrophy of type II muscle fibers.  I wouldn't be surprised if hamstring and calf CSA were higher in the walking group, but that wasn't reported."
AdvancedFitness,2zps2n,tadawdy,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:56:57 2015 UTC,"Wasn't familiar with that specific study (Gergley 2009, JSCR?), but am reading it and the ergometry was done at 65% MHR. The cadence used WAS fairly low, but was NOT ""maximum resistance to sustain 60+ RPM""; the cyclists maintained 60-80 rpm and the resistance was adjusted to maintain target HR. Since power is a function of angular velocity and force, they modulated pwr output to maintain HR.  IDK why they chose that cadence, as ""real"" steady-state cycling would more typically use a cadence of 80-100+ rpm. An odd choice, IMO, but I don't think it's fatal.  You are right to point out similarity of strength tests and cycling. Still, what do you propose the choose? Don't we care about strength in compound movements? Gergley used leg press, and the use of a muscle through a larger ROM (which is specific to strength trainng) may actually be part of why cycling seems more beneficial.  I am also more interested in the body of literature than this one study. I think a better starting point would be the meta-analysis of Wilson, et al. Regardless of whether this is the best topic for a meta-analysis, the review does bring together a broader picture than one study with the flaws you mention. The Wilson study does also show that running/walking seems to lead to more fat loss.  The 2009 Gergley study (I think) you're referring to does not appear to have been included in Wilson's 2012 meta-analysis.   EDIT: Maybe we are talking about different studies. Pubmed only returned Gergley 2009 when searching for concurrent training with walking."

I think there isn't much research cause it's very hard to design a study like this well, and control it. You'd need a big enough number of people of the same age, with similar starting points (lifting experienc, body fat) that strictly controls what and how much they eat, how they train, sleep etc. With so many parameters, your results will be open to interpretation at best, meaningless at worst.

It's hard for me to tell whether it was the conservative bulk or the genetics who played the biggest role here. However I have always been naturally skinny.

I believe number of fat cells is inherited to some degree too.  The problem with +100 or +200 is that amount is easily wiped out depending on measurement errors, false information, and the thermic effect of food, so it's easy to wind up at maintenance or a deficit when shooting for that number.

He is studying his ass off and working very long, hard hours for hardly any money with the goal that he'll be able to work as a professor and researcher one day.  ""Is it worth it?"" is really a tough question. I was told that I would be accepted in the PhD program at the school I got my Master's at, should I apply, but I felt that it WASN'T worth it because I wanted to work in a field more practical instead of sitting in a lab doing research all day. You may find that it IS worth it. I guess it just depends on what your love is and what your goals are. It totally will dominate your life and you will live/eat/breathe research and studying for 4 years with the hopes that one day it will pay off. I just didn't want to take that risk, but it may be worth it to you, especially if you really love this. If you're just looking for an advanced degree and a title, DON'T do it."

AdvancedFitness,2ywzje,poetrydude66,28,Fri Mar 13 15:05:28 2015 UTC,"UW Kinesiology undergrad here,  Yes usually the amount of fats and carbohydrates burnt in exercise and at rest can be expressed as a ratio of VCO2/VO2 (Called the respiratory exchange ratio or RER). Now at rest, you are typically burning 33% carbohydrates and 66.7% fats for homeostasis, as fats provide the Krebs cycle and the ETC with more ATP at a more rapid, consistent rate. At the onset of low intensity training the body shifts into Beta-oxidation to increase the rate of ATP production relative to the work rate you are exercising at. The RER will now change to 0.7 which in the equation basically means you've increased your body's rate of Oxygen consumption while your VCO2, or the CO2 exhaled stays relatively low. As work rate increases the demand for energy and Oxygen increases, and the body shifts into using more muscle-stored glycogen to break down in glycolysis to assist with additional ATP production. Eventually you will hit a point where your muscles are producing so much CO2 (from aerobic metabolism, and now additionally lactate from glycolysis) that the rate of CO2 exhalation will exceed the rate of Oxygen consumption and thus your equation will yield an RER of 1.0 indicating 100% energy utlization of carbohydrates.   Sorry for the drawn out explanation, but many many many studies have confirmed this, and trends you see in the literature demonstrate this consistently.  TL,DR; You burn more fat at extremely low intensities per unit time and burn more carbohydrates at very intense work loads per unit time. As VO2 increases, substrate utilization transitions from primarily fatty acids to muscle glycogen (glucose)."

AdvancedFitness,2ywzje,JtoSwole,1 point,Mon Mar 16 05:49:14 2015 UTC,"Because in HIIT you burn more calories in total. As intensity increases you rely more on carbohydrates to provide energy, but since you are burning so many calories you end up burning more overall fat in a given time period compared to a low intensity exercise. With low intensity, fat provides most of the energy but you burn less calories in a given time period. HIIT also has carryover fat oxidation effects."

AdvancedFitness,2ywzje,Mysta,2,Sat Mar 14 17:29:02 2015 UTC,That was most likely just your CNS quickly forgetting the motor unit recruitment/rate coding that consistent strength training provides.

AdvancedFitness,2ywzje,aesthetic-as-fuck,3,Mon Mar 16 02:05:34 2015 UTC,"You might be getting hung up on the ratio versus actual amounts of substrates being used. Let's say I need 10 ATP at rest (obviously not a real number), and 3 of those come from glucose and 7 come from fat. I then start lightly exercising and now need 20 ATP. Maybe we're still getting 3 from glucose, but now we're getting 17 from ATP fat, so the ratio has shifted even though actual glucose use has not changed."

AdvancedFitness,2yy5eo,HubrisXXL,3,Fri Mar 13 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"Are you asking a general question about le chatliers principle? There is a thermodynamic equilibrium for any chemical reaction that will be restored at some rate when concentrations of the relevant chemical species are perturbed. In this case PC is more thermodynamically stable than ATP - but given a high enough CP:C ratio and a high enough ADP:ATP ratio some P will move to ADP to make ATP. This equilibration is accelerated by enzymes in many important processes, though in this case it might happen plenty fast on its own, I'm not sure.   Edit. The end of your question seems to be about the reaction mechanism itself. When it comes to moving phosphates around in a cell, it usually looks pretty similar.  look for nucleophilic attack by an O- on ADP to the N-linked P on PC."

Le Chatelier's principle basically means that when you have a chemical reaction, there's a certain ratio that the sides of the equation like to be in, maybe because it's the most energetically stable. This is true for every chemical reaction, as far as I know. When there's a high concentration of ADP, the phosphate group shifts to that side of the equation to move the ratio towards where it's most energetically stable."

I'm a marine biologist with only essential cell biology education, so I don't have the answer, just a personal hypothesis.  I think about atrophy as a failure to maintain the structure of individual myofibrils, that atrophy is the end result of two processes: the lack of stimulation of muscle fibers leading to downregulation of maintenance pathways, either through downregulation of protein synthesis required for myofribril maintenance or activation of proteolysis that accelerates breakdown (more likely) as well as the case of starvation, where there is a critical lack of energy/building stones e.g. free animo acids required, for myofibril maintenance leading to activation of such a proteolysis pathway.  You appear to be incorrect in your assumption that myofibrils are not lost in a case of atrophy, see e.g. here. I'm sure there's a well-sourced answer to your question already available if you do some research, again, this is just a hypothesis coming from someone with cursory knowledge of cell biology."

So essentially, the myofibril will be reduced/broken down.  The number of fascicles and muscle fibers will remain largely unchanged from birth to death, they will just be smaller, and less full of myofibrils.  I'll check my textbooks to see if there is a clarification on this, and update if I'm wrong on anything."

How can you say that the organs are growing essentially to ""catch up"" with the rest of the body if the only reason the body is that big is because of anabolic steroids?  This may be a chicken/egg thing, but whether the organs are independently influenced by the hormones or weather they are pressured to grow through the rest of the body growing (which is influenced by hormones) they are in one way or another caused to grow by the same factor.    Also why didn't older bodybuilders have roid gut proportional to their size?

This is counter to the popular opinion that bellies are an indicator of drug use. So all the d-bags on /r/fitness and facebook that view the abs on female crossfit athlete as proof of GH use are wrong to claim that as proof. They might very well be on GH and who knows what else, but their bellies no more imply drug use than their muscles. I think that is what the article was getting at, not indicating it's safe because it would happen even if you were able to get huge naturally. Getting big increases mortality with or without steroid use. I can't provide a source for this assertion but every study I found that studied steroid mortality or cardiac hypertrophy did not control for actual muscle mass or sport performance. They generally only controlled for years training. It's hard to control for obviously because then you need to find the genetic elite to compare to mediocre steroid users, and it's next to impossible to control for dishonesty.  2 - Arnold, Franco, etc are much smaller than modern bodybuilders, and most pictures you see of them are posing with their gut sucked in.

AdvancedFitness,2yd3fq,Scatcycle,18,Sun Mar 8 19:35:31 2015 UTC,You don't need to be on advanced fitness. You need to get back to basics and stop doing a full body workout every day. If you can do 10x6 on a certain lift day after day then you aren't going heavy enough.
AdvancedFitness,2yd3fq,mattlikespeoples,-5,Sun Mar 8 21:49:27 2015 UTC,"You're being quite presumptuous. I had run GVT for over 6 months, and then I noticed I felt like I could do more. It was still as painful as ever, but I felt less taxed. Doing 10x6 on a GVT split or 6 months gets you used to that kind of thing. So I combined upper body days and added shoulder lifts. It's very hard and extremely taxing. I'm not leaving any energy when I leave my workout. The rep scheme is 10x6, but the weight is always heavy enough that I fail reps in the last sets. This also ensures maximum energy expensure, assuming I have strong willpower during my sets, and push. Which I do. Whenever I get all 60 reps I raise the weight. It's silly to say I need heavier weight when you know nothing about my workouts besides the rep schemes. Everyone's different and I can handle a high workload. It helps that I have trained this specific and unusual (long eccentrics) workload for quite a while. I lift every other day, I get a day of rest.   Regardless, you still failed to provide any scientific content or theory that suggests anything about rest and recovery. Even if you come to the assumption that I should be lifting heavy, the question is not specific to me.   Edit: well, I just realize I had a massive typo in the title that stated I work out every day. I meant that I work out every other day, and I get where you were coming from now. Well with that out of the way,..."

As far as the recovery aspect goes concerning the order of your lifts that seems rather complicated. Would Your lateral raises for your pecs and tris to work harder during press? Would curls before lat pull down make your lats work harder? I'm not a walking EMG but I would suspect that be the case. It, however, sounds like you're doing what you can to counteract this by changing the order so I dont think that any one thing would be too overstressed as not to recover.   Your second study seems to only look at protein synthesis which can be a good indicator of damage but might not tell the whole story. It also only looks at elbow flexion but these were 6 maximal sets which sounds similar to your program but does not include the additional exercises targeting, possibly secondarily, that particular muscle so that is increased volume over the specified volume. Your triceps are probably toast at the end of a workout.  The first study only seems to point to AMRAP work being good for strength and not so much for size without be detrimental to recovery. Now, you could possible infer that if you're last is of 10 is as many as you can do at that weight then that'd technically be an AMRAP set and you results could correlate with the study.

Your body use minerals (Na+/Cl-/K+/Ca2+, to name a few) to regulate active and passive process of certain pathway via protein channels that require specific binding of certain minerals and they goes from High Concentration to Low Concentration (Passive) and vice versa.   One example is this: * [The norm is that you have High Concentration of K+ inside the cell than outside the cell)... Now imagine if you have too high of a concentration of K+ outside the cell, that would block the natural leaky channels of K+ going out the cells and K would influx into the cell instead and changing its membrane potential and prevent other mechanism from happening...thus mess up the balance of a lot of other things that its regulate.

Celery has a thermic effect of around 8%, much less than the 100% or more required for a food to have ""negative calories"". A stalk of celery provides 6 kcal to the body, but the body expends only half of a single calorie digesting it. Even proteins, which require the most energy to digest, have a thermic energy of only 20%–30%. Diets based on negative-calorie food do not work as advertised but can lead to weight loss because they satisfy hunger by filling the stomach with food that is not calorically dense."

AdvancedFitness,2xz3sy,LookHardBody,2,Fri Mar 6 23:54:58 2015 UTC,"Net. Kinda.  Very simply put, you can track a single molecule (lets say sugar) from ingestion to expulsion (from sugar to carbon dioxide).  The difference in energy (Gibbs Free for instance) can then be calculated using a variety of means including a calorimeter.  Now we have the total amount of energy that is usable from that molecule.  But no machine, including our body, works at 100% efficiency.  So we do some science, trying to estimate that efficiency.  We come up with something like this, the Atwater System.  It is an approximation, and it is important to understand what that means.  Also the coeffients used in Atwater end up compensaiting for non-direct paths (i.e. what happens if a sugar is broken down then built back up).  While futile cycles like this largely don't happen they inevitably do happen.  This is why some people are interested in looking at 'outlandish' diets like keto where more of the energy maybe wasted as heat.  I have tried to simplify this a bit so there may be some minor errors.  If you want more detail please ask.    -edit-  Important to note, chemical reactions are path independent.  The energy potential is dependent on the initial and the final state.  How many steps doesn't change the potential."

This is a bit like discussing the limitations of the navy method of BF estimation vs DXA. Sure, DXA is more accurate in the literal sense of estimating actual mass of body fat. On the other hand, the navy method tracks metrics like waist circumference which are more than accurate enough for a health overview and probably MORE relevant to what most seasonal dieters care about. They just want to fit into last year's swimsuit, they don't care how fat density factors into it.   Similarly, if I'm a previously obese individual who's frustrated that I'm prone to gaining weight back when I eat like my anthropometrically similar friends, do I really care that there's an explanation involving a difference in my fat density?  My thinking as this individual would be this: I've put in the work, lost the weight, and gotten my measurements in order. If I still have physiological differences that affect my metabolic rate that might explain the physiology of my (so-called?) metabolic damage rather than refute its existence.   On the other hand, I kinda wanna call BS. Maybe this individual is prone to gaining weight back for the same reason they gained it in the first place and implying there was some damage caused by dieting does nothing but discourage obese people from improving their health.

AdvancedFitness,2xwxi3,nigelregal,6,Wed Mar 4 15:34:27 2015 UTC,Layne nortons idea of metabolic damage is that with severe caloric restriction and getting to low body fat levels; metabolism will slow down a lot to compensate but recovers if you eat more calories. Issue is if you flip a switch and eat more calories right away metabolism doesn't balance out so you gain a bunch of fat and over time metabolism balances out.

AdvancedFitness,2xq24t,incredulitor,3,Mon Mar 2 23:16:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm...    At higher nitrate doses, however, a partial reversal of this effect occurred; this was accompanied by increased renal erythropoietin expression and stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors, likely brought about by the relative anemia. Thus, hepatic and renal hypoxia-sensing pathways act in concert to modulate hemoglobin in response to nitrate, converging at an optimal minimal hemoglobin concentration appropriate to the environmental/physiologic situation. Suppression of hepatic erythropoietin expression by nitrate may thus act to decrease blood viscosity while matching oxygen supply to demand, whereas renal oxygen sensing could act as a brake, averting a potentially detrimental fall in hematocrit.   At first I wondered how many beets you would have to eat to get to the far side of the U-shaped dose-response curve, but when they say ""could act as a brake"", that makes it sound like you won't get more EPO and higher hematocrit no matter how much more you eat."

Resistance exercise or HMB alone did not significantly reduce abdominal adiposity.     Full Study LibGen PDF Here   These data suggest that supplementing HMB in combination with 12 weeks of resistance exercise decreased AFM in elderlymen,while interventions consisting of only HMB supplementation or progressive RT were ineffective at reducing this potential health indicator     HMB on Examine.com   When compared to leucine, HMB appears to be significantly more potent on a gram per gram basis at attenuating the rate of muscle protein breakdown but is less effective than leucine at inducing muscle protein synthesis. Due to this, HMB is marketed as an anti-catabolic agent (purposed to reduce the rate of muscle breakdown) rather than an anabolic agent (purposed to increase muscle mass).     I am also curious to hear of others experience with HMB, please share your experience if you can"

HMB required 5 tablets spaced through the day, which I would say is a hassle. I do not bulk, but simply try to live with an 8 pack, though a six pack is ok in the winter, but I haven't tested above 9 percent since I started dexa scans.  For me, HMB supp for 2 months had no clear effect. In fact, I think it did nothing for me.  For the record, I decided year round in the low 8's was best for me... No one notices the sub 8 percentages as a positive change, but remaining there after cutting down required from me more effort than steady state in the low 8's (which is no real effort to me, it's just ""normal"" steady state)."

Comparing placebo groups suggests that resistance training for 12 weeks increases abdominal adiposity while not training reduces it. That doesn't sound right...   I'm not sure what the standard error of estimation is on the DXA/software they used is, but these results seem suspicious. I'd be curious to look over the remainder of the data about weight & mass changes and find out what the subjects' diets looked like (although it doesn't look like they got into that at all).

Noakes is notorious for not playing nice with others in a sense that he enjoys debunking dogma but usually fails. This book has some great points but also jumps to a lot of conclusions and extreme points of view.
AdvancedFitness,2x3g5x,Furthur,1 point,Wed Feb 25 22:20:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for offering. I'm curious about the first bullet points in the article, specifically the last two:    Drink only to thirst, not on a schedule. Drinking does not prevent heat illness. Ingesting salt is unnecessary in ultras. Urine frequency or color has nothing to do with hydration or kidney function.   So as a general rule should endurance athletes not be consuming electrolyte drinks during races, or even at all? If not, is there any need to replenish sodium/potassium/etc afterwards, and how do we know to do so?  What does urine color and frequency indicate, if anything?  Thanks!   Edit: clarified a question"
AdvancedFitness,2x3g5x,joshrice,2,Thu Feb 26 21:10:55 2015 UTC,"Endurance athletes need to replenish electrolytes as they are ""used"" or discarded through sweat, urine, ventilatory water loss.  the concentrations in your blood/urine/sweat may be low but if there is one system of minerals your body absolutely needs it's these neurotransmitters.  Your whole body water is essentially a balance of where sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium hang out.  Losing these (water follows electrolytes) through sweat will decrease plasma volume which is one of the bases for cardiac drift and fatigue.  drinking does NOT prevent heat related injuries (HRI) as it's often the go-to remedy for those who are experiencing heat exhaustion.  My group observed a wildland firefighter who went down on the line from heat exhaustion, ended up with heat stroke and they pumped him full of fluids and got him to a hospital where they put him on even more fluids. He died from hyponatremia.  What they should have done is immerse him in cold water and given electrolyte drink instead of just water/saline.  MDs don't usually think about these things unless they have a background in sport physiology and exertional HRI. Moral is; take breaks, get out of the sun (shade) and let your skin evaporate sweat to cool you or as my thesis co-writer used, try ice slurry/slushie to encourage enthalpic heat of fusion transfer in the gut.  Drinking a ton of water endangers your electrolyte balance as you know the people who die from hyponatremia as mentioned by Noakes are the slow un-fit ""athletes"" who think they need to hit every aid station and down a gallon an hour.  simply not true, replace your sweat rate in liters per hour with an 5-8% CHO/Electrolyte drink or usually about 1.5L/hour in the heat and you should be fine.  Do your own sweat rate calc, nude weight pre and post exercise and get out for an hour or 90min and do this as the weather changes every 10°f or so.  exercise diverts metabolic needs to working muscles and skin for evaporative transport of sweat for cooling your blood.  In normal circumstances you are filtering solute and discarding urea (nitrogen based molecule) in the form of urine which gives it it's color and smell.  Why is there urea in your urine? discarded amino acids and other solutes are caught in glomerular filtration, why are there AAs in my blood? muscle protein degradation, eating too much PRO like nearly everyone does and exercise induced catabolism.   Extremely fit athletes barely drink anything in races up to marathon distance.  You don't see 10k runners stopping at aid stations on their way to the 24min win.  The folks that come in at the 60min mark? They might actually lose a moderate amount of plasma volume and total body water.  How much do they need? could be anywhere from 0.25-4L after the race if it's a hot day.    electrolyte [ ]’s of sweat vary in literature (difficult to measure & variance among individuals, ↓’s with training, race and acclimatization), but Na, Cl, K, Mg, Ca, and Fe are all lost, but Na and K appear to be the major constituents.             Sweat:  Na = 20-80 mmol/L (mEq/L)                     K = 4-8 mmol/L                     Cl = 40 mmol/L  here is the current position stand from ACSM on fluids and exercise.

These short-term or intermediate endpoints are common when the desired result is difficult to measure for some reason, but they don't always work the way you hope.   For example, if you're interested in knowing whether a drug prevents people from dying from a certain disease, would you rather have data on death rates in people taking the drug vs not, or information about blood markers of the disease?

Outside of that a refeed can decrease cortisol which can also coincide with weightloss as increased cortisol causes water retention.  but as simple_mech said carb cycling is something else and not done every 6-12 days. I think the primary goal of Carb cycling is regulating carb intake around workouts to prevent glycogen depletion. There are some other benefits I am not so sure about."

AdvancedFitness,2vuhxd,failon,8,Sat Feb 14 14:39:37 2015 UTC,"The manifestation of strength is a neuromuscular process, which is to say that there is a neural and a muscular component to strength.  What you're talking about is neural drive, the strength of the signal from the nervous system to contract the muscle. This does increase with practice and training. Most strength gains you see inside of 3 weeks of training are due to improved neural drive, though improvements here do continue on past that timeframe.  The muscular component should be pretty obvious. The cross-sectional area of a muscle is very strongly correlated with its ability to generate force. Weight training stimulates the muscles to grow, generally on the timeframe of months to years. This increases strength.  Training improves both of these things, not one or the other."

AdvancedFitness,2vutjj,judojosh,1 point,Sun Feb 22 09:50:32 2015 UTC,"So I guess my description doesn't quite cut it.  From a baseline (what is an appropriate baseline; in cycling it is a 20 minute functional threshold power test)... from which you can calculate with certain accuracy an athletes 1 hour time trial capability, and also calculate programming to suit starting at the annual training program, for certain goal events to ensure 'peaking' at the right time and with the right capacity (increased threshold and capacity).  From there you plan the meso-cycles that will get you to your peak, and then the micro cycles to make those happen.  From there a training is captured with power output on a per ride basis (per exercise in weight training) for a Training Stress Score. Which is a standardised number for that training session for that individual. A TSS of 100 is equivalent to doing a 1 hour at threshold time trial on a bike. So regardless of the athlete (Olympian vs novice) a TSS of 100 is equivalent to their ability. A TSS of 400 would be a very very difficult and endurance ride while solo with large sections of sustained above threshold power output and short recovery times. Or a moderately under threshold ride of a duration approaching 8 hours (200km in a fast group ride for example).  Accumulating those TSS scores within approximately one week (micro-cycle), builds your acute training load number. As your ATL grows without a long term chronic training load (CTL) (eg: going for a hard week without a few months of longer term conditioning behind you) changes your Training Stress Balance (TSB). TSB = ATL/CTL. Throwing the TSB off too far with a high ATL = super compensation (if you have a deep recovery coming up) through to over training (no recovery). Getting the TSB too low will either bring up your compensation/adaptation to training stimulus or not see adequate training volume/intensity to achieve the required targets for your peak event.  This allows for scientific certainty in planning a training program for a beginner, intermediate or advanced athlete off the same basic theory, for different target events through the year off a different baseline capability.  Following Mike Israetel on Facebook, he is looking into similar concepts but calling it MRV which is Maximum Recoverable Volume. He's releasing a book which may be quite beneficial in this area soon and I plan to pick it up to have a good read, but i'm wondering if anyone else has seen work done for similar to the above.  Or is the ability to train power and lactate threshold in endurance athletes even transferable at all to the strength athlete (power lifter, weight lifter, strong man)."
AdvancedFitness,2vutjj,judojosh,2,Sun Feb 22 23:58:12 2015 UTC,"Find your 1RM for each lift. You can do this via plenty of 1RM calculators that are available online.   From here you plan your periodization program. There are several to choose from. If you want to dig into this you can pick up any of the following books  http://www.amazon.com/Science-Practice-Strength-Training-Edition/dp/0736056289 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/073607483X/ http://www.amazon.com/Supertraining-Paperback-Yuri-Verkhoshansky/dp/8890403802/ http://www.amazon.com/Optimizing-Strength-Training-Designing-Nonlinear/dp/0736060685/  Mesocycles and microcycles are further explained in those. Depending on the periodization you choose, these cycles will vary and and will dictate how much weight you lift based upon your 1RM and the goal of the cycle. Currently this is pretty much the closest you can get to what you are describing.   If you want to explore new technology, you can check out http://www.trainwithpush.com/.   It tracks velocity of the movement and suggest to the user to either add more weight or decrease the weight. Not sure on the accuracy of it yet as it is new to the field.   Also Polar sells stuff that you can use to track yourself but I am not sure if it is available for consumers yet.

Use of similar accelerometers and strain gauges is similar to direct-force meters (generic term for a tool measuring the force produced by the cyclist output, either in the crank with a strain gauge matrix, accelerometers in the pedals or strain gauge matrix in the rear hub) from a cyclist point of view. I've seen others which measure the speed of the barbell by attaching a cable to the barbell, and entering the weight which is going to be moved. This works 'ok' if the movement is in the linear direction, but could be prone to error if the barbell is moving laterally with a weightlifting move or with an athlete 'hop' either forwards or backwards.

Keep it simple. Rotation exists as a distinct category but I think it's a lower priority, especially for most beginners.  If they're doing bodyweight training or are OK with a lot of exercise volume/variety because they're more advanced, then I understand splitting pulls, pushes, and rotations into planes and directions. Then you can start mapping exercises across other axes like single-leg, explosive, and so on.

But recent evidence indicates that exercise can slow down this effect [...] resistance training activates a muscle stem cell called a satellite cell [...] the biochemical, physiological and genetic signature of older muscles are ""turned back"" by a factor of 15 to 20 years [...] high intensity exercise protects people at the chromosomal level as well. It appears that exercise stimulates the production of telomerase, what allows for the ongoing maintenance of genetic information and cellular integrity.

The social ""gainz"" it has made have been tremendous, I can be a lot more spontaneous when it comes to grabbing a bite to eat or a drink at the local watering hole and not have to whip out my phone to make sure it all fits in my macros. I stayed the same exact weight and body composition, no fat gain or noticeable muscle gain (I've been lifting consistently for about 4 years now so I don't have to much more muscle to gain), My goal was to stay exactly the same body composition (5'10"" and about 180 lbs. with 10% body fat) but increase my calorie consumption as much as possible, to a point where it was difficult to maintain, knowing I would be entering a cut at the end of it.  The cut I have just started will end in 12 weeks above the calorie level I began my last cut at which should allow me to feel much less drained at the end of it.  If you have any more questions I genuinely don't mind, PM me if you'd like.

AdvancedFitness,2vs34w,mx_missile_proof,3,Wed Mar 11 16:50:39 2015 UTC,"I second all of the wisdom above. Just wanted to add, if you're a female, menstrual cycles are a big indicator. Women can stop ovulating and/or menstruating in the absence of sufficient calories even if they don't lose weight. This can happen in women of varying body fat percentages. Hypothalamic amenorrhea (suppression of the hypothalamus during physiologic/mental stress) will suppress menstruation, and can be brought on by excessive exercise (presumably because unchecked high cortisol suppressed GnRH), insufficient nutrition (calories and/or dietary fat), sometimes intermittent fasting (in women), or a combination of the three.   Women can ovulate and not menstruate (more of a partial suppression of gonadal activity), or they can cease ovulating and menstruating (full-blown hypothalamic amenorrhea). My understanding is that as long as ovulation is occurring, a woman is mostly okay in terms of having sufficient estrogen/progesterone production and keeping other bodily cycles in balance. There is a sizable base of evidence that supports the ideas that sufficient estrogen is important for soft tissue injury prevention, bone mineral maintenance, mood, libido, and cardiovascular health in women.   The idea that ovulation without menstruation is ""good enough"" is an unpopular/not-well-researched idea, and conventional wisdom says that the menstrual lining must be shed in order for a woman to be healthy, but I disagree (this is evidenced by the many forms of now popular progesterone-only birth control methods that suppress menstruation but not ovulation). In the medical field, I have seen many female athletes with scant or absent menstruation but clear monthly ovulation, whose health and well-being are far above those who have stopped ovulating.  Good ways to check for ovulation include daily morning basal body temps (kind of a pain in the ass, but decently reliable) and general libido. Libido should spike during ovulation and build throughout the last 2 weeks of a cycle.  The benefit of checking basal body temps is twofold: it can also unearth any potential subclinical hypothyroidism or hypercortisolism secondary to overtraining and/or undereating. Same with morning heart rate.  My apologies to the OP if my exceedingly in-depth post about female physiology does not apply to him. I hope some readers of this thread find this information useful.  :]"

AdvancedFitness,2vq7wo,Colinhurley,8,Fri Feb 13 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"I have an MSc in exercise physiology. If you want to pursue working with endurance athletes you should absolutely find a professor who's research interests align with yours and contact them.   Generally research in the field (specifically endurance athletes) involves a two areas of research: Molecular biology/physiology which mostly involves mouse and rat models looking at mitochondria, proteins, mechanism, etc. and human research using muscle biopsies and measuring metabolic markers related to (endurance) exercise. The other area would be performance, which would look at the impact of things like beetroot juice, caffeine, HIIT, different training routine etc. and how they impact race pace, AT/LT and V02. Theres also tons of research looking at different pathologies and exercise (i.e the impact of type 1 diabetes on V02).   To find programs, you really have to look at the faculty members of different universities and check out their profiles. You could also take a look at a paper you find interesting and look for the authors, and the different authors they reference in the paper.   For career opportunities after, you could definitely work in coaching or training, but be prepared to work more with  pathological populations, like cardiac rehab patients.  This is purely from my experience in a Canadian University - of which most have kinesiology or exercise science graduate programs"
AdvancedFitness,2vq7wo,JohnVanbiesbrouk,2,Fri Feb 13 04:05:39 2015 UTC,"Have a look at the researchers in University College Dublin, Ireland. There's plenty of endurance athlete research that could be done and expanded on and I know at least three of the professors/lecturers are very interested in both HIIT and endurance. Romain Denis is a fantastic exercise scientist, and a keen cyclist. Professor Eamonn Delahunt might also be interested but as it stands he seems to be more inclined to research HIIT, field sports and general population health. Good luck though! I'm a final year undergraduate there, so just take a look if you want to see what's available."

AdvancedFitness,2vq7wo,keepitonthekipside,2,Fri Feb 13 19:07:20 2015 UTC,"ExPhys PhD here. You should definitely look for schools that have faculty with similar interests. This will not only give you exposure and experience working in the area you're interested in, but also help you make the right connections. Having a good mentor is probably more important than going to a well-known program. For instance, if you're in Florida, I would say UF has one of the best Exercise Science programs in the country, but I don't know of anyone there specifically doing work with cyclists (although I would still recommend looking into their program; look into the College of Health and Human Performance or the Department of Applied Physiology & Kinesiology).  If you're trying to get into research, then you should also try to find out the funding status of the faculty mentor you're interested in working with.  I don't have any advice on how to find specific programs other than to just go to the school's website and look around. As mentioned elsewhere you can also find some recently published papers on topics you're interested in a see where the authors are from. Most program's websites have a list of faculty with their research interests, but these are notoriously out of date. Don't be afraid to just e-mail faculty members or the department and see what kind of info they can offer.  It can be a pretty small world, especially once you get into specific interests, so if you can find even one person from your undergrad program to talk to they may be able to make some suggestions.  Also, major advice: don't pay for it unless you really have to. There are often lots of assistantships/fellowships for grad students. Sometimes you just have to ask around. But just make sure you do it early."

Abstract Obesity is a major health problem in the developed and developing world. Many ""functional"" foods and ingredients are advocated for their effects on body composition but few have consistent scientific support for their efficacy. However, an increasing amount of mechanistic and clinical evidence is building for green tea (GT). This experiment was therefore undertaken to study the effects of a high-catechin GT on body composition in a moderately overweight Chinese population. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, 182 moderately overweight Chinese subjects, consumed either two servings of a control drink (C; 30 mg catechins, 10 mg caffeine/day), one serving of the control drink and one serving of an extra high-catechin GT1 (458 mg catechins, 104 mg caffeine/day), two servings of a high-catechin GT2 (468 mg catechins, 126 mg caffeine/day) or two servings of the extra high-catechin GT3 (886 mg catechins, 198 mg caffeine/day) for 90 days. Data were collected at 0, 30, 60, and 90 days. We observed a decrease in estimated intra-abdominal fat (IAF) area of 5.6 cm(2) in the GT3 group. In addition, we found decreases of 1.9 cm in waist circumference and 1.2 kg body weight in the GT3 group vs. C (P < 0.05). We also observed reductions in total body fat (GT2, 0.7 kg, P < 0.05) and body fat % (GT1, 0.6%, P < 0.05). We conclude that consumption of two servings of an extra high-catechin GT leads to improvements in body composition and reduces abdominal fatness in moderately overweight Chinese subjects.

AdvancedFitness,2v5iiw,castlec,1 point,Sun Feb 8 13:04:03 2015 UTC,"Although I can't disagree, my main curiosity is whether heat treatment matters. Heat releases the caffeine. It seems to release the catechins as well. Because of that, it seems like it would matter.  I'm clueless though."

AdvancedFitness,2v5bqk,did_it_before,5,Sun Feb 8 01:12:45 2015 UTC,"yes and no. some of the extensors need to be strengthened and some of the flexors. When your head is in front of your shoulders, some of the superficial flexors of your neck are working too hard, but in order to keep your head perpendicular to the ground you end up extending the top of your neck (suboccipital muscles) and pointing your chin forward compared to your neck. I tell my patients to tuck their chin while pushing the back of their head into their headrest in sets of 10 while they're at stoplights. you can also wear headweights that force you to contract against forward head carriage like what I have linked below.  http://pettibonsystem.com/product/headweight-harness-adjustable"
AdvancedFitness,2v5bqk,lazy_smurf,2,Sun Feb 8 05:00:09 2015 UTC,"To accomplish the same thing, people can stop using a pillow when they sleep. A couple days after sleeping on your back with no pillow, and your neck will likely be straightened out. When positioning the neck while sleeping flat, you pull your chin a little downwards until it is noticeably more comfortable for you to breathe properly.  It's much easier to sleep on your back if you have a harder surface to rest on. It may feel awkward at first. Or the ground is too hard for your head. I still use a pillow every once in a while because of  that. The easiest way to make myself sleep completely flat is to do some exercise or be physically exhausted from my day. My body and neck like the flat ground because it lets all of my muscles relax instead of, like you said having the neck muscles work harder in the front.  Instead of only doing exercises like you are saying, I find it more useful to sleep with my neck straight, and because my neck is now more flexible for the rest of the day, while walking around I can remind myself to pull my head back and lower my chin, which really helps with breathing effortlessly. This can also be done while sitting down in any position, to improve chair posture.  If you really can't sleep without a pillow, just try laying down to rest for 20 minutes every day (which is useful for other reasons) without a pillow, and your neck will slowly align itself."

I agree that it's a great change for people to make and I think I'll give it a try sometimes. Thanks for the tip!  Another position you can use to rectify abnormal curves is laying face down with your feet hanging off the edge of the bed or couch, propped on your elbows to read or watch tv. it restores lumbar and cervical lordosis while activating neck extensors. The better you get at it, the farther in your elbows can be and the longer you can hold it."
AdvancedFitness,2v5bqk,lazy_smurf,1 point,Mon Feb 16 22:19:31 2015 UTC,Thank you for writing this... My problem is that my breathing seems uncomfortable without a pillow while lying on my back... Do you have an recs for learning more about this style of fixing the loss of curvature?
AdvancedFitness,2v5bqk,iEATu23,1 point,Wed Feb 18 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"Other than the stretching you can do on your own, no. It's the same thing as teaching yourself to straighten your back instead of slouching.  The thing is that pulling your head forward and up (like using a pillow) is what is done to clear the airway passage for a person in recovery when being saved from something. So I can understand what you mean. Maybe you just need to work on your lung power and by getting used to having the proper neck position and training yourself to take deeper breaths, this won't be an issue for you anymore.  What I meant by having the correct neck position helping with breathing is that it's easier for me to use my lower muscles to take more fulfilling breaths, instead of only filling the upper part of my lungs."
AdvancedFitness,2v5bqk,postalmaner,1 point,Wed Feb 18 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"I spent two months doing daily traction to my neck in order to correct a straightened curve, and to pull my head back.  You might have similar luck doing traction.

Never got an after, but it feels drastically better with just one exercise: http://gaintrain.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/my-neck.png  I remedied by own forward neck posture - Grade-A military neck, as you can see - with a resistance-assisted chin tuck. I'd place my hands (palm out, thumbs crossing) against my forehead, do a chin tuck, and add a little resistance with my hands. Yep, just that whenever I take a little work break, in line at the grocery store, watching TV, just whenever. That small habit really added up something fierce.  Actually, since I don't have an x-ray of your forward neck posture (and thus, don't know exactly what your particular problem could be), I may rescind my solution. I recommend you get your butt to a physical therapist with an x-ray. Or a doctor with an x-ray. Or a chiro with an x-ray. As long as someone's doing an x-ray.

Usually my cardio was done fasted, are you fasted during workouts? I was also restricting calories heavily and (2x daily workouts) 5 -6 times a week, but not experiencing decreased performance or over training symptoms (resting heart rate log).    Without getting into it, I had a similar experience, I felt fine and had improving performance with strength and medium distance (1-2hr) cardio. Though not elite I was fairly well conditioned (500lb deadlift, sub 2hour half marathon).

To answer your question, I don't always exercise fasted, but I did experiment with it for a while. Weekdays (after work) workouts used to be on a 4 hour fast, but the weekends were on 14 hour fasts (my post-workout shake was at 16 hours).

AdvancedFitness,2v0jfp,DanH44,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:59:51 2015 UTC,"Glad to see you've apparently figured this out! So it seems that your body is much happier with a reasonable amount of carbs in your diet to fuel all the activity.   Interestingly, I came to the same result for myself about a year ago after a few years of very low carb and IF. I'm better in every way now that I ensure I consume about 200 grams of carbs per day. And if your results are similar to mine, I believe your testosterone numbers will continue to climb as well for quite some time.  Here's an article by Nate Miyaki on eating Paleo but with enough carbs to correctly fuel hormone function and performance levels for those that train hard."
AdvancedFitness,2v0jfp,DanH44,4,Fri Feb 27 23:17:52 2015 UTC,"You (bio-hacker) say:   My issue is relatively complex.   I don't think so. And since you asked, I'll say why. Your only symptoms are:  elevated FBS poor sleep high LDLc    Your situation only seems complex because you've allowed yourself to be persuaded by a few guys selling paleo books that a high fat diet is harmless. If I google ""free fatty acids nafld"" (without the quotes), here's what I get (google is smart, it knows what I'm looking for; yours will probably give you something different):   --- see the screenshot at http://i.imgur.com/nDdl5FO.png) ---  Notice the sentence I highlighted. If you go to that link, in the abstract you can read:  Glycyrrhizin (GL), the major bioactive component of licorice root extract, has a variety of pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-modulating activities. GL has been used to treat hepatitis to reduce liver inflammation and hepatic injury; however, the mechanism underlying the antihepatic injury property of GL is still poorly understood. In this report, we provide evidence that 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), the biologically active metabolite of GL, prevented FFA-induced lipid accumulation and cell apoptosis in in vitro HepG2 (human liver cell line) NAFLD models. GA also prevented high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic lipotoxicity and liver injury - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18452148  Notice, in particular in that abstract the final words: ""high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic lipotoxicity and liver injury""  My guess is you are in the beginning stages of fatty liver disease due to a high-fat diet and that your liver is now insulin resistant and leaking glucose overnight. Your sleep problems are secondary to your insulin resistance. Your high LDLc is also produced by your high fat diet.  I had the same 3 symptoms a while back. I did a ton of reading and the blog posts starting with the one you were linked to show you how I found my way out of that problem. The final solution, which gives me the lab values I posted in my blog was produced by some subset (or all) of the following interventions:    seguing to a slow-carb diet w ~75g fiber, mostly soluble / day  no casein or gluten  SFA intake under 10g per day  omega-6 intake under 6g per day  750 mg molecularly distilled fish oil per day + 2 oz salmon  installing f-lux on my computer (f.lux.com)  flushing w the std colonoscopy prep (Miralax + Dulcolax)  only Ivory soap may touch my skin: no deoderants, shampoos   I suspect that the reason your LDLs are high is that, like myself, you have the e4 allele of apoE and are heterozygous for it (e3/e4). I found this out using the $99 gene testing from 23andme.com. I recommend anyone who has high LDLc with a high fat diet get this testing done. It is well worth it. For your $99 you get genotyped for about a million SNPs!!   I believe it is the e4's (present at 25% of the population) that have skewed the LDLc response curve to SFA so as to confound the result (from chap 19 of the Berkeley Heart Lab - Physician's Reference Manual):  --- see screenshot at http://i.imgur.com/AyPkCUz.png ---  Note also that it is the apoE4's that have the high CVD risk and it's generally not very responsive to statins.  When I was trying to figure this stuff out about MY high-fat diet a while back, I had to ask myself, why is it more reasonable to believe a few cholesterol skeptics with books to sell, rather than the preponderance of evidence. Do I love my meat that much that I'm willing to risk my life over it? It's a matter of making a type I error vs a type II error. Nope! I'd rather play it safe and go with the error with the smallest downside; especially since that's the side with the strongest case.  So, anyway, I advise getting your genome tested and then you will know more about your case. You can get a health report from Promomethase once you get the testing done. I can discuss that with you if you want.  EDIT: I see from reading here that darthluiggi has great lab values after 14 years of low carb. I have several thoughts:    One data point is called anecdotal evidence. Do not be lulled into thinking it has any significance.  Glucose can be easily monitored. Free fatty acids (the downside of low carb) cannot.  As you get older, avoiding insulin resistance gets increasingly tricky.   I have better labs (at 70 yrs of age) with no insulin resistance to worry about on my slow carb diet.   You can see my labs here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R28GPLFQWN5ZSC/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&asin=0967089700&cdForum=FxG04AIRNU7OS7&cdMsgID=Mx26V5OHM85UKCQ&cdMsgNo=23&cdPage=3&cdSort=oldest&cdThread=Tx1DRPW2RM2VWFN&store=books#Mx26V5OHM85UKCQ"
AdvancedFitness,2v0jfp,aManPerson,3,Sun Feb 8 04:20:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your well thought out, in-depth response, /u/DanH44. You present some interesting theories, but I'm not totally on the same page.  First, the high LDL was taken during the period of high saturated fat intake (meats, bone marrow, coconut, etc.). I have since moved away from that, only consuming about 12 ounces of beef per week, reducing my fat intake to about 30% of my caloric intake, and keeping my carbs at ~40%, protein the remaining 30%. I reduced the meat & saturated fat about 8 weeks ago, and have changed the macronutrient ratios more dramatically starting about 4 weeks ago now; I suspect my numbers would be beginning to reflect this change. Regardless, I have always – and now more so than ever – taken in very high levels of fiber through vegetables, fruits, and more recently, oat groats & sprouted grains.  I already have a 23andMe account. Please tell me which Gene / SNP to search for and I'll let you know if APOe4 is present. I have also used Promethease, but its been about a year and I don't recall my results on APO. I'd have to repurchase it now to rerun the test.  In regards to liver health, if that were an issue, wouldn't I be seeing that reflected in my liver enzymes? Also, keep in mind, although my LDL was high in the past, the ratio to HDL & triglycerides to HDL are both very good.  Good recommendation on f.lux; I've been using that for the past year. I also have absolute darkness in my bedroom, pink noise (better than white noise) when necessary, 68 degree temp, moisture wicking linens, etc. I've experimented with gaba, phenibut, glycine, melatonin, l-theanine, 5-htp, l-tryptophan, fish oils, phosphatidyl serine, taurine, holy basil extract, ashwaganda, Relora, L-Ornithine, lemon balm, california poppy, valerian... the list goes on.  I believe my issue is cortisol related, and most likely as a result of inadequate carbs, or calories overall (paleo / whole foods made me a lot less hungry). Although I am far from having perfected it yet, here's why I believe that:   When I up my calories beyond what I care for – which requires I eat some ""dirty"" carbs, like cereal, granola and ice cream – I sleep better. Coconut butter doesn't improve my sleep nearly as much. Theory: More calories + carbs reduces my cortisol Of all the supplements, a pill containing Relora, Theanine, Taurine, GABA & Holy Basil Extract; melatonin 60 minutes prior to sleep; 200mg phosphatidyl serine & l-ornithine have worked the best in keeping me asleep through the night. Theory: These supplements work on reducing cortisol and increasing melatonin during sleep. If these specific supplements help, but the others don't, it further suggests that it's predominantly a cortisol issue, with high FBG a side effect of inadequate carbs+calories I began training again 2 days ago. Taking the aforementioned 2 steps (food + supps) resulted in the best night sleep I've had in months, and a FBG of below 100 for the first time in months (96). This is despite training intensely; which leads me to my next theory: it's not a matter of overtraining (maybe a little bit of overreaching, though).   /u/Further posted a response to my original question a couple days ago (in another topic; as I indicated, I reposted this as it's own topic), which I think is very likely to be the case. It reads:   well, you did the right thing be eating more carbohydrate. low CHO is not the diet of an athlete. period. People really need to understand that they are fucking with very sensitive feedback loops when they set out on these weight loss crashes. So first off, the long term training with low CHO might have caused downregulation of the GLUT4 receptor, it doesn't see much, doesn't need to be there to bring it in. Same goes for insulin production, if you aren't causing it's release it shuts itself down. HRV being heart rate variability? What method are you using? RR interval or just an increase or decrease? I wouldn't be alarmed by either of your A1C or FBG numbers, maybe if insulin sensitivity is your concern to a fasted oral glucose tolerance test as that would be a better demonstrable test for your systems response to a glucose bolus. And yes, you're talking genetic manipulation when you take something like glucose out of your diet, it will take a bit for your body to resume or upregulate the processes again. I really doubt you are over trained so much as under fed. those are thousand calorie workout sessions in some cases and RMR is probably 1600-1800kcals on top of that AND your normal daily activity which could be another 1000. Eating before bed might be something to check in on if your metabolism is so seemingly active, do you notice if you're warm or heat up as you sleep? Keep on with the HRV testing, try a morning step test and resting rate assessment and continue to log them. and more than anything, take a break every once in a while, you seem like you're working yourself to death! 7 days a week isn't something even the elites do, you have to give yourself rest and recovery."

It's good that you're taking steps to correct this   I have always – and now more so than ever – taken in very high levels of fiber   Also on the right path! My guess is your problems are w gluco-regulation secondary to proliferation of LPS gut bacteria. This problem ubiquitous now as we are experiencing diabetes incidence of pandemic proportions. Please watch the EASD podcast I linked in that blog post /u/grae313 linked. Also please watch Guyenet's video here, starting at 16:45 (this was linked in another of my blog posts, Rethinking Paleo – the good, the bad and the ugly ... I am linking that post because in that lecture Guyenet is guilty of  mis-attribution and I point that out there.)  So, I believe you may well be helped by re-populating your gut flora. For that, I've found that 70-80g mostly soluble fiber seems to work   Please tell me which Gene / SNP   ApoE is 2 linked SNPs, - see SNPedia - APOE - rs429358 and rs7412. Promothease calls the e3/e4 genotype of apoE ""gs141 (C;T) (C;C)"", where the CC is the 7412. Just click the 23andme link on the right of the SNPedia page and it will take you to your raw data.    In regards to liver health, if that were an issue, wouldn't I be seeing that reflected in my liver enzymes   Only if elev liver enzymes precede beginning liver damage <- is a question of which shows up first. My liver enzymes were perfect even though I was showing beginning heptotoxicity as evidenced by my FBSs over 100. I'm telling you, switching up my diet has completely restored my FBS back to the 80s   although my LDL was high in the past, the ratio to HDL & triglycerides to HDL are both very good.   There is no guarantee that raising HDL by any and all means will always have a positive effect on health. High HDL may only be a marker for exercise which is known to positively effect health. In fact, quite the opposite, there is evidence both from failed HDL-raising drugs and Mendelian randomization GWAS studies of high HDL that higher HDLs in those cases is unrelated to health, unlike the case of LDL where the GWAS studies both showed association and, of course, therefore nailed the causitive nature of the association because we know which came first - lifetime exposure to higher LDLs.   I believe my issue is cortisol related, and most likely as a result of inadequate carbs   OK, that's good! When you up-d your carbs, you prob down-d your fat. But instead of upping your carb intake w processed foods, up it with legumes, get your fiber intake up into the 70s, perhaps flush your current gut bacteria to facilitate the changeover  EDIT: I just realized my intervention list from my prev reply omitted vit C. The corrected list sb:   segueing to a slow-carb diet w ~75g fiber, mostly soluble / day no casein or gluten SFA intake under 10g per day omega-6 intake under 6g per day 750 mg molecularly distilled fish oil per day + 2 oz salmon 2g vit C per day in divided doses w meals installing f-lux on my computer (f.lux.com) flushing w the std colonoscopy prep (Miralax + Dulcolax) only Ivory soap may touch my skin: no deoderants, shampoos"

I'm not sure why LPS would be implicated in my scenario, when I am still and always have been extremely lean, don't exhibit any signs of inflammation or permeable gut barrier, nor any signs of leptin resistance. In fact, if anything I seem to be very leptin sensitive, as I am having trouble finding the hunger to eat as many calories as I'm expending each day. With that said, for the past 12 months I've been taking Prescript Assist, with the occasional addition of resistant starch, GOS & FOS.  Also, in the study that he references, the diet was not only high in processed saturated fats, but also processed carbs. My diet was 100% unprocessed & low in carbs. In other words, it's like comparing a paleo diet to SAD – both with high amounts of fat – and considering them to be the same thing.  Please tell me if I'm missing something, which I very well might be, especially since most of what Guyenet talks about is new to me.

Are you sure you can rule it out? With MetS, symptoms show up in different orders for different people. It's perfectly normal to show hepatic IR before obesity is ever exhibited. That's how it is for me, showing signs of hepatic IR although also myself also quite lean (8% BF).   Also, in the study that he references, the diet was not only high in processed saturated fats, but also processed carbs. My diet was 100% unprocessed & low in carbs. In other words, it's like comparing a paleo diet to SAD – both with high amounts of fat – and considering them to be the same thing.   I just wanted you to see that link because I was very excited to see Guyenet coming around to paying attention to resistant starch and fermentable fiber. But, you know, I coulda said the same thing about my diet a year ago: ""100% unprocessed & low in carbs"". But, sadly, my FBS was creeping up and I was sleeping like shit. I changed to this diet and my FBS is now in the low to mid 80s and I sleep through the night. Doesn't seem to matter how much or how little I exercise. I'm at a loss to explain this without invoking gut microbes!   My genes: rs429358: TT rs7412: CC   So you are e3/e3 - that's good! I'm surprised. I didn't know that e3s could also experience elev LDLc w excess SFA.    How do you know that this is hepatotoxic?

Now, obviously I question that line of reasoning – hence the motivation for this entire post – but playing devil's advocate, how do you know it's putting negative stress on the liver?   Elev FBS is symptomatic of NAFLD. Of course, I can't prove that's what was going on, but if I google ""high fat diet-induced hepatic lipotoxicity"", I get tons of relevant hits. I think it's a dangerous game these apologists for the high fat diet are playing and the burden of proof should be on them to show it's safe. Like you, my entire motivation for the diet change was so that I could feel safer and not have to worry.    In the case of my LDL, some would argue that my ratio lends itself to no cause for concern, but I agree with you; I think it should be lower, and have therefore reduced my saturated fat intake, in exchange for more carbs. Now, I'll have to keep a closer eye on my triglycerides.   Here's my last labs at 25% P, 25% F and 50% C, all carbs from unrefined, unprocessed, high RS / fiber sources - TG is not a problem: TC: 186 LDL: 89 HDL: 87 TG: 49   With all of this said, I'm curious of your opinion of the theory that my FBG numbers are predominantly caused by inadequate caloric intake, too few carbs for my lifestyle, or a combination of the two. Your theory is interesting, and may be correct – or a contributor – but I'd like to know what you think of the calorie/carb/physiological insulin resistance argument, which my gut (ha!) tells me is what I'm facing.   Back when I was low carbing, I pursued that physiological IR thought for quite a while. I was reading everything I could, trying to prove to myself either that it was harmless or that it was a problem. Although I never really felt the case was proven, the more I read, the more concerned I got, to where I finally decided to go to higher carb.   Here's the thing: it was really, really hard to add carbs. My BG would skyrocket and stay up a long time. I could only drop my BG by going for a hard run. It took immense effort to turn this around. So I don't think for me it was a harmless physiological IR. I wouldn't want to offer an opinion about what's going on with you.  I can tell you this: when I get too few calories, I lose weight, it doesn't elev my FBG. With my current diet, my FBG numbers don't budge. Nothing I do now makes them budge. No more FBG drama! No more blood sugar drama. I eat as much slow carbs as I want and my PP BGs go to 120 max! It's a F-ing miracle as far as I'm concerned.   Why so much Vit C? I'm concerned about levels that high, as they have been shown to reduce the gains made from weight training.    It's part of turning on and off insulin resistance. I found out about it from Johnson's work (see The Fat Switch)   I'm going to pass on the colonoscopy at this point   I just mentioned that in case the prep I had to do for it had anything to do with the success of the diet change."

AdvancedFitness,2v0jfp,DanH44,2,Sat Feb 7 06:39:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm pretty sure that keto / very low carb threw things off. If you look through the quotes at the bottom of my post, you'll see some sites that speak directly to the issue of ""physiological insulin resistance"", and it being caused by low carb. Fasting can also cause it. I would imagine that caloric deprivation could also. Hyperlipid has the most info on the topic, though at times is a bit over my head with the biochem.  In my experience, including healthy carbs for 30-50% (50% when you train) of your intake is the way to go, with low-carb diet days on occasion when you're cutting up (on non-training days). This particularly true if you're already lean.  FYI, last night I forced myself to eat more than I normally would, including a lot of honey, greek yogurt and an apple, just before going to sleep. I woke up with FBG of 96 today. It's only one day, and glucometers are notorious for 10%+ errors, but it's a fairly good sign."

To get up to speed, first read this: Going Feral: my one-year journey to acquire the healthiest gut microbiome  To challenge our notions about the applicability of the Kenyan diet, search for ""Kenya"" in this text on this page and start reading there: THE TOKELAUANS, THE SAMBURU, AND THE MASAI AGAIN In addition to what he mentions there, do not forget to factor into your thinking the affects of parasites in these pre-industrial populations.  Also from this one, The Masai Model, Part I:  ""It appears to me the other source which piqued interest in the Masai was this study, which indicated their blood cholesterol was low despite diets rich in animal foods.  Heart disease seemed rare.  The lead author, George Mann, did not conclude animal foods are somehow protective against heart disease back then, but some of today's primitive dieters will say just that.  Mann later examined the bodies of Masai men at autopsy.  He observed that although they did not develop lesions that might lead to heart attacks, he did note that their arteries were as thick and hardened as those of old men in the United States.  By this time he thought what saved the Masai from heart attacks was the larger diameters of their blood vessels, perhaps due to exercise.""  And finally, read this: Logic 101: Why The Resistant Starch And Gut Biome Revolution Means Doom For VLC/Keto  So that's a small fraction of what I've read about this. My thoughts are that a relatively new area of study has popped into existence recently and holds the promise of explaining everything. We CANNOT go back and duplicate the gut conditions of the Paleolithic era. I am offering you - with resistant starches and soluble fiber - a way that works here and now to get your lab number back to ideal. Even if you have already (just recently) become diabetic. Even if you have shitty genes (like me with apoE4). Even if you are 70 yrs of age. Even without meds.   Perhaps the high protein high fat diets work for some phenotypes. That's fine. I strongly believe they won't work for all, for sure not the 25% of us who are positive for apoE4.   It may be that other diets can be put together that will also give you sterling lab values. But to ignore it if you have questionable labs is in my eyes, sheer folly.  EDIT: I forgot to mention, though, even if you have great labs, they don't check for free fatty acids, which apparently is as destructive to beta cells (and other body parts) as is glucose. Glucose is really easy to monitor. So you can check your FBG once a week and know how you are responding over time to the slow carb diet."
AdvancedFitness,2urem9,nonethewiser,5,Wed Feb 4 15:23:22 2015 UTC,They note that young fit group had unusually high pre testosterone. No explanation as to why or why it dropped.   The study found once everyone exercised testosterone levels evened out between groups.   You can't make conclusion that if you are young and fit that testosterone drops with exercise.   One possibility is they were doing something typically to obtain the high testosterone (who knows what) and during the study they did not do that so levels dropped. Could be they were doing less exercise during the study than before.   Unless you have another study which reproduces the results I wouldn't go crazy over it.

AdvancedFitness,2uoqwo,davidjohnson314,5,Wed Feb 4 03:31:59 2015 UTC,"According to this study, it's about 8 weeks. However, the subjects were on a highly restrictive diet here.  ""In human beings, maintenance of reduced body weight is met by coordinate metabolic, neuroendocrine, and autonomic responses that favor the regain of lost weight"" (source above)  According to this study, female participants saw an ""increased [...] total output of cortisol"" after only 3 weeks of (1200kcal) restrictive dieting. It doesn't say what their TDEE's were before dieting so it's hard to tell how quick the hormonal environment would change on a (small) -100 or -200 kcal daily restriction.  Interesting quote regarding hormonal changes: ""Results from a number of studies indicate a general endocrine response to hypocaloric diets that promotes increased hunger, reduces metabolic rate, and threatens the maintenance of lean mass. Studies involving energy restriction, or very low adiposity, report decreases in leptin [1,10,28], insulin [1,2], testosterone [1,2,28], and thyroid hormones [1,29]. Subsequently, increases in ghrelin [1,10] and cortisol [1,30,31] have been reported with energy restriction. Further, there is evidence to suggest that unfavorable changes in circulating hormone levels persist as subjects attempt to maintain a reduced body weight, even after the cessation of active weight loss [32,33].""

Some folks skip breakfast and eat late into the night, keto, 8hr window of eating, 6 small meals, 3 larger meals, ect... you're adherence is what makes you successful. If an occasional refeed/ cheat/ whatever day helps you the other 6, perfect.

AdvancedFitness,2uoqwo,newuxtreme,4,Fri Feb 6 19:39:41 2015 UTC,"I'd like to get in on this discussion.  1) I'm a little confused about the set up here. Both lose 1lb per week. Person B however also increases his calories on training days, and reduces on non training days, to maintain caloric deficit of 3500. We assume he gains .75 muscle and .25 fat. But there is no assumption of how much extra muscle he loses on the next day when the reduction of calories is more severe. The greater your caloric restriction the greater the loss in LBM that shall occur. You will be at 1lb below because of 3500 calories, but going from say just a 500 calorie deficit daily, you will have to go to a massive 500+(3500/4) deficit, to account for the greater caloric intake on the previous training days(else you won't gain that .25lb)  2) From my understanding it actually won't even help with the 'hormonal balance' of leptin and ghrelin most importantly, the hunger hormones that control your appetite.  Reason being, metabolism=cata+anabolism. Tissues are being broken down and made all the time, you cannot stop either one, you can just do your best to increase and reduce the speed of either one. However you do it though, needs to be repeated, no one activity can change their speeds and keep them constant at the new speed.  Both leptin and ghrelin reponses will depend on the nature of the caloric deficit. If it is light of anywhere from 100-500 calories per week, then you will still have these 'slowing down' or malfunctioning but it will take a long time for those results to set in, by that time you have probably accomplished a lot of weight loss, and if the caloric restriction is not severe as in the case above, you assume to have saved more lbm and lost more fat mass.  If you reduce by 500-1000 calories or more however, of course your weight loss will be faster, but so will the malfunctioning of these hormones. However because of the extreme cut you end up losing a lot of weight, which will mostly come from lbm and lesser from fat mass. Which defeats our purpose.  At the end of the day whether you change calories on a daily basis or not, the caloric restriction will end up affecting both Leptin & Ghrelin and other hormones. With a balanced daily restriction you don't go to extreme and so don't see extreme adaptations. With a daily change you would see extreme adaptations because of extreme changes.  Another interesting fact that could in some way or the other affect this set up. Protein synthesis for the targeted muscles are elevated for 24-48 hours after which they come back to baseline. If you are trying to take advantage of the protein synthetic spike with surplus calories in the first 24 hours you also need to think of the protein synthetic rate drop in the next when you drastically reduce calories, simply put more reason to lost lean mass.  These are the things that come to mind right now, if I remember something else and folks are still interested in the discussion I'll add to it later!"
AdvancedFitness,2uoqwo,aManPerson,1 point,Wed Feb 4 08:07:58 2015 UTC,"1.) But there is no assumption of how much extra muscle he loses on the next day when the reduction of calories is more severe. The greater your caloric restriction the greater the loss in LBM that shall occur.   There is an assumption that 25% of the loss comes from LBM, as the deficit is greater on rest days for person A, more lbm will be lost, this has been accounted for in my calculations. However, my ratio of 75:25 fat:lbm loss was just a made up ratio. You seem to be intimating the ratio of fat:lbm loss will move more towards lbm loss the greater the deficit, whereas I had the ratio at a constant. Any research you could point me in the direction of in terms of lbm loss during deficits? I guess the questions I want to answer are ‘is there a max amount of fat loss with no lbm loss?’ and ‘is there a deficit figure where the ratio of lbm to fat loss increases?’    You will be at 1lb below because of 3500 calories, but going from say just a 500 calorie deficit daily, you will have to go to a massive 500+(3500/4) deficit, to account for the greater caloric intake on the previous training days(else you won't gain that .25lb)   1lb was just an example though. If losing 1lb per week creates too big a deficit for Person A, the example could easily be changed to both losing 0.5lbs per week or 0.25lbs per week, the theory would still apply, but the answer to my questions above would dictate the max deficit allowed on a rest day  2.) I feel this is a separate issue to the one I’m trying to discuss. This is a general cut/diet issue, which is a question most people ask themselves at the start of cutting, ‘how big a deficit can I get away with?’. Again, decreasing the deficit shouldn’t effect whether my theory is flawed or not. It may be flawed but not because of the size of the deficit.    Another interesting fact that could in some way or the other affect this set up. Protein synthesis for the targeted muscles are elevated for 24-48 hours after which they come back to baseline. If you are trying to take advantage of the protein synthetic spike with surplus calories in the first 24 hours you also need to think of the protein synthetic rate drop in the next when you drastically reduce calories, simply put more reason to lost lean mass.   This is the most interesting part for me and one where my knowledge is lacking. The best I can do is apply common sense to the scenario and see if someone with greater knowledge can debunk it.  The post workout feeding window would supply calories for about 39hrs. I don’t know how this works in terms of calorie usage for building muscle and just general functions. If someone could explain that to me that would be great :)"
AdvancedFitness,2uoqwo,Antranik,1 point,Thu Feb 5 14:18:32 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I'm sorry for not replying earlier, thanks for tagging me to the reply.  1) I understand your ratio is made up, but the slower both the increase and decrease in weight in general, the more preferential weight you gain or lose. For example if you were to gain as little as 100gms per week, more of it would be muscle, turning the ratio towards greater lbm gain. If you were to lose only 100gms of weight per week, almost 90-99% of that can be assumed to be fat. The less extreme the changes the more the body can handle the demands we put on the body, i.e. always get or maintain more lean tissue, always get least possible and lose more fat.  The fact that this ratio changes with the numbers is very well known and I'm sure you will find tons of studies for the same, it would be akin to finding a study that says that breaking down muscle tissue makes them rebuild stronger beyond the previous amount.  The NSCA quoted the most probable efficient fat loss number to be about 1% of bodyweight. If you lost .8 kg if you are 80kg, you would be losing a good amount of fat and maintaining more of your lean tissue, rather than if you were to lose 1-1.5 kg on a bodyweight of 80kg. I think the number we most throw around of 1lb/week is because 1lb generally always lies within 1% of most of our bodyweight. Most of us that are into sports, athletics, weight training and similar activities prefer to keep as much lbm as possible. If you were to give a weight loss program for a person that weighed only 40lbs, that .5lb that is so little for us, would be too much for that person.  2) Similar to the stuff I mentioned above, the more you prefer to keep your lean tissue the slower & more consistent your fat loss phase should be. The caveat here-in that it should be do-able. There is no point in increasing weight by 5-20 grams though most people quote that number to be the amount of lean tissue we can gain per day. It is unreasonable to track, and even be motivated for a goal of a few grams per week for an indefinite period of time.  There is no concrete number of what is the deficit one can get away with, but numbers like .5lbs and 1% both give you ideas of numbers that are do-able, keep one motivated and are maintainable and realistic, without being too extreme.  In case you're interested in my other articles and such that I write from time to time my blog is :-http://newuxtreme.wordpress.com"
AdvancedFitness,2uoqwo,incogenator,1 point,Wed Feb 11 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"Couple of things   I think we both agree that reducing the size of deficits and surpluses improves calorie partitioning and that my deficit was too high in the original example, but as I said before that shouldn't affect the theory. Back to the orginal question. If we reduce the deficits on rest days, will person A be able to increase LBM whilst on a weekly deficit?"
AdvancedFitness,2upgm4,dustofoblivion123,4,Wed Feb 4 01:50:13 2015 UTC,"I've only done 2 cuts, but I've always followed Layne Norton's guidelines from his Ultimate Cutting Diet and had pretty good results.  One should also incorporate re-feeds into their diet plan. Re-feeds help boost a hormone called leptin, which is the mother of all fat burning hormones. As one diets, leptin levels drop in an attempt by the body to spare body fat. Periodic, proper re-feeding can raise leptin levels and help one continue to burn fat an optimum rate. A person who is lean will need to re-feed more frequently than someone who has a higher body fat percentage. For those who are below 10%, it is probably a wise idea to incorporate re-feeds two times per week.  For those people who are in the 10-15% range, re-feeding every 6-12 days will probably be adequate, for those who are above 15%, re-feeding will probably not need to be done more than once every week to two weeks. Obviously as one loses body fat they will need to re-feed more often.  Re-Feed Days Should Be Planned As Follows:  Re-feed on the day you work your worst body part(s) as re-feeding will not only raise leptin, but be quite anabolic.  Keep fat as low as possible during re-feed days as high insulin levels will increase dietary fat transport into adipose tissue. In addition dietary fat has little to no impact on leptin levels.  Reduce protein intake to 1 g/lb bodyweight.  Consume as little fructose as possible as fructose does not have an impact on leptin levels.  Increase calories to maintenance level (or above if you are an ectomorph) and increase carbs by at least 50-100% (endo’s stay on the low end, while ecto’s should stay on the high end) over normal diet levels."

They're not good terms since they by definition include a LOT more than that distinction, but we don't seem to have better terms.   It is pretty well documented that different people are pre-disposed to different ratios of lean vs fat mass, appetite levels, etc. On the one hand I want to defend his use because of that. On the other by using those terms he's propagating their misuse instead of being part of the solution to the misunderstanding (and abuse by people who use them to avoid responsibility for the role of their habits)."

AdvancedFitness,2upgm4,Heemstedenaar,4,Wed Feb 4 13:57:55 2015 UTC,"Sure. I want to re-iterate first that I think sedentary, obese people with poor diets would be abusing these findings to cite them as the explanation for their poor health.   That said...   An older twin study:   Results suggest that human obesity may be influenced by behaviors that are themselves genetically regulated. However, further studies are needed to obtain more precise heritability estimates and a better understanding of the conditions under which genetic influences on energy intake emerge.   I've said before in this sub that indirect body composition factors have to be taken very seriously which is why I link this one. If someone has an abnormally high or low appetite, that could be one of many factors contributing to their mass when eating ad lib. And appetite could itself vary due to many reasons.   Also there's the issue of response to training   In the following review I will discuss new developments linking genetic and transcript abundance variability to an individual's potential to improve their aerobic capacity or endurance performance or induce muscle hypertrophy.   So even people beginning with comparable body compositions that start similar diet & training routines will end up with a variety of body compositions due to individual tendencies.  I'm intentionally avoiding ""obesity research"" since it's a pretty loaded topic, though I'm certain there's a ton of great information there as well since there's been so much research. But I've seen in passing for instance variations in FTO pathways being related to obesity and such. But trying to stay somewhat near fitness community use of endo/ecto I'd rather point out examples of people who are eating responsibly and are in shape, or at least out terribly out of shape, and still exhibiting individual variation."

AdvancedFitness,2upgm4,phrakplzbanme,3,Wed Feb 4 01:58:23 2015 UTC,"So basically, your net weight change averages +4 pounds/month while cutting. I approve.   Kidding aside, my habits/experiences are similar:    Hold a moderate planned deficit and steadily lose weight for a while Experience sudden, inexplicable, severe hunger Feed that ""extra"" hunger with whatever it wants till it's gone Lose weight at same rate anyway, paradoxically sometimes faster   I've actually noticed when I follow my hunger levels my average across 3-days or so doesn't usually change by more than maybe 200 calories unless I also have more activity than normal. I'll be extra hungry, decide to pig out, end up only eating an extra ~300-500 calories over my usual target before I'm no longer hungry (even if I expected to eat a whole pizza), and then the next day I lose my appetite maybe 200 calories before my usual target.  I have similar variation in my need/desire for carbs vs fats.   So to answer OP's question of how I organize them: I don't.   What others call carb cycling and re-feeds I simply call eating what I'm hungry for when I'm hungry for it and just watching my averages / progress.  Given how poorly we seem to understand metabolic variations and changes, I question how much better planned cycling and re-feeds are than going by gut feeling (nyuck nyuck) on when you need it. Planning them might be hugely superior, I'd just love to see the comparison.  If it matters, I've had no problem losing 10+% of my body weight per phase with this approach, at least into the teens of BF%. I've never tried to diet down to visible abs."

Hyperhydration isn't a very good term to use here, you should be considering tonicity and plasma sodium concentrations here instead as pumping your body full of water is never a good idea. It's pretty tightly regulated on it's own and unless you're diseased it works pretty damn well.  Glycerol is the backbone of triglycerides, TRIGs are typically released by lipolysis and then broken down into FFAs and glycerol which is usually shuttle back to the liver for glycogen production but that's usually blunted by the effects of exercise although not entirely. Your liver WILL find a way to make new glycogen whether that's from circulating glucose, glycerol or amino acids.  To lose fat mass you want this to be from glycerol suggesting you're metabolizing adipose. If you're recovering as a balanced athlete you want this to be from plasma glucose because you just ate after exercise.  If you want to waste away and lose skeletal muscle you exercise depleted and fasted and don't eat anything post exercise and if there is no circulating BG or glycerol the catabolic effects of exercise will pull AAs from your oxidated skeletal muscle fibers to do the same as above.  So, if you're in a period of starvation glycerol sup. might help you regenerate liver glyc but the amount of energy stored in your liver is pretty miniscule in comparison to your skeletal muscles and fat stores.  If you don't need to replenish liver glycogen it could be used to store excess BG as adipose but that means you didn't even touch your muscle glycogen either so work harder.    All said, are you after a pump? or are you after ""lean gains""?

AdvancedFitness,2ugryq,akabalik_,2,Tue Feb 3 23:39:45 2015 UTC,to add to that... be more concerned about nitrogen balance if you're trying to maintain muscle mass and changing body comp. exercising fasted and skipping glycogen recovery post-exercise is the way to lose weight but can jeopardize your lean tissue. keep nitrogen balance throughout the day and take it easy near exercise time and you should be fine.

AdvancedFitness,2udotx,xediii,1 point,Sun Feb 1 18:29:04 2015 UTC,See parent thread. Results are equivocal.
AdvancedFitness,2udotx,xediii,2,Sun Feb 1 18:30:27 2015 UTC,"Got it. My first intuition is the same as /u/beniro. One of the symptoms of overtraining is elevated chronic cortisol, but at the same time I also remember reading about how exercise lower HPA axis activity in the long run, which above study also found (EDIT: at least 24h after, they didn't study more long term effects). So maybe the conflicting results stem from the fact that depending on the stressor/sample studied/timepoint measured, the body is at different stages of recovery."
AdvancedFitness,2udotx,Furthur,2,Sun Feb 1 18:39:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's because when HPA axis is suppressed, only certain portions of the pituitary can be affected, e.g. anterior pituitary vs. posterior.  In women, overtraining will lead to hypothalamic amenorrhea via partial HPA axis suppression. ACTH can, in that case, have a field day, elevating cortisol, which creates a bit of a catch-22 by suppressing the female's only source of testosterone (adrenally sourced).  From my research, there are likely great variations between the sexes, as well as between individuals and different sports.  In the endurance sport community, it is generally accepted that endurance athletes will have at least minimally increased morning cortisol, at worst substantially increased. In some cases, athletes will ""burn out"" and cortisol will gradually peter out, leading to an Addisonian overtraining syndrome. In other cases, cortisol remains elevated for years or decades--perhaps in individuals with more hearty HPA systems or with less stress outside of training.  My ultimate question lies in whether or not this latter group can experience negative sequelae from chronically high cortisol--namely insulin resistance but also things like increases in body fat and fat distribution, cognitive impairment, and perhaps ""lite"" versions of symptoms seen in Cushing's.  Seems like it would be the natural evolution of elevated cortisol, no? Anecdotally, I know of endurance athletes experiencing this, but I haven't been able to find any literature to corroborate."

AdvancedFitness,2udotx,Furthur,3,Mon Feb 2 03:54:32 2015 UTC,"This is really simple if you're directly relating cortisol to the blunting effects of exercise on insulin secretion.  Cortisol is released from the adrenal cortex in response to rising levels of ACTH brought on by exercise intensity. (that is a very abridged explanation)  Cortisol is a necessary steroid hormone to live. Simply put, we cut the adrenals out of a mouse and don't supplement cortisol? it dies.  So don't look at it as a bad hormone. Consider deficiency diseases like Addisons and chronic hypoglycemia and overabundance diseases like Cushing syndrome and hyperglycemia.  Cortisol secretion is part of a larger scale operation to keep your brain fed with glucose during exercise or times of starvation or when other substrates aren't present for normal metabolism (ultraendurance exercise, low carb diets).  Insulin is blunted in secretion by the effects of the catecholamines on the beta-cells of the pancreas.  In both graded and prolonged exercise (that's a time based comparison.. 12min to 50min) the same effect is noted in that insulin is suppressed and the others continue to rise or plateau near max or after a certain time.    BUT. cortisol also increases gluconeogenesis AND uptake of glucose into the liver (glycogenesis). It's a direct antagonist to insulin and is often considered diabetogenic.  Essentially it's job is to to keep BG high for liver glycogenesis and keep the brain happy.  That's it.    The big difference here is how transport of glucose across the plasma membrane works.  Normally in a non-exercise and non-diseased person glut-4 is the receptor mediated transporter that recognizes insulin and says HEY! lets bring in some glucose for some of that tasty glycolysis action.  In T2dm patients that doesn't work so well as either their insulin ""doesn't work well"" or they've downregulated the receptor transporters to the point where they don't recognized the insulin very well.    The kicker is that in an exercising subject, none of that matters. Glut4 can be brought to the surface for what we call ""mechanical transport"" and completely bypasses the need for insulin to keep the cell rich in substrate for ATP generation.    Other than a few of your studies linked having no relevance to the question (T1DM?!) What none of these abstracts mentioned is how hepatic output of glucose works after the cessation of exercise. It's NORMAL to have elevated BG after cessation of exercise. You stopped exercising, insulin is still suppressed, no mechanical transport anymore, liver still pumping out BG for 30-60min post cessation.  this has nothing to do with insulin sensitivity, it's a fundamental understanding of how BG is meant to be kept in circulation for your brain and the feedback loops needed to turn off hepatic transport aren't as swift as others.  edit: the question is, what's going to happen when insulin is no longer suppressed? they needed to follow people for about 6 hours after cessation with no exogenous food sources.  If BG stays elevated after all that? then there is a problem."

However, I'm afraid I'm not referring to the blunting effects of exercise on insulin secretion.

You seem very knowledgeable on this, so perhaps you can help?  Issues:   FBG 105-115 (Post prandial 1h never above 143, 2h typically 90-110). Poor sleep (sleep onset is fine, but I tend to be pretty restless)   Stats:    Male, 29, 9% bf, 5'10 178lbs HbA1c = 5.6 TSH: 1.82 Free T3: 3.4 Free T4: 1.2 Test: 475 Free Test: 66   Note: Libido is moderately low, though I am approaching 30! ;)  ALT / SGPT, ALP, Billirubin, Albumin, Tot Prot, Globulin, A/G Ratio all good. AST / SGOT slightly high (44); could be from alcohol 2 days prior or exercise 1 day prior. Kidney health, bone health, blood health, vitamins & minerals all optimal levels. hs-CRP: .02 LDL: 150 HDL: 90 Triglycerides: 76 I'm not gaining weight / fat, other than a small amount from upping my cals and not training much over the past 2 weeks (maybe 1% increase in bf%; I've had 7-10% bf since I was a child, regardless of diet and activity levels).   Activity:    Exercise 5 days, sometimes 6 days/wk.   HIIT 2 days  weights 3-4 Most workouts are 45 - 70 minutes I throw in some 5-6 mile cardio about 1x/wk    Diet & Sleep:   2.5 years ago: Low-carb diet (not strict, but I'd estimate 150-200 g/day) 1 year ago: I followed keto for 6 months; began blood glucose / ketone readings, noticed high levels of FBG. Believed it to be gluconeogenesis via physiological insulin resistance 6 months ago: I switched to VLC / low carb (100-150g/day). Issue remained. 1 month ago: I progressively added more carbs in. Poor sleep for past 18+ months. I fall asleep immediately, but toss and turn a lot (video). I get about 3 periods of 40-50 mins of no movement per night.    When I'm low-carb, I consciously wake up, energized. When I'm higher carb, I wake up, though barely consciously. I fall back asleep more easily too, with carbs. I presume it's cortisol spurring gluconeogenesis?    Theories:   I considered overtraining. I took the last week completely off, and over the past 2 weeks have only done two runs (5 miles each), one HIIT sprint cycle (8x30secs incline treadmill at 14mph) and one calisthenics workout. I considered low-carb, so I upped my carbs into the hundreds of grams.    Note, my mood is much improved after adding carbs back in.  I considered hypocaloric diet. Low carb paleo made me less hungry. Or, rather, not feeling the sensation of hunger as often (no more cravings for food). Over the past 2 weeks I've experimented and have found that I can eat more food than I thought, to the point of feeling full; I get hungry again after 2-4 hours. Poor sleep contributing to poor cortisol / blood sugar control, sparking a negative, long-term cycle? Stimulants. I removed them (coffee, tea) completely for a week with no effect.   Recent / Results:   I took the last week off from training; same numbers Began eating 200-350 g/carbs /day for the last 2 weeks; same numbers Increased caloric intake to ~3,000kcal on non-training days for the last 2 weeks; same numbers (though I subjectively notice better sleep on higher cal & carb days) I've begun measuring my AM HRV for the past week; yesterday (day 5 of rest) was best, today (day 6 of rest was 2nd worst).   Thoughts:   The fact that my numbers don't shift no matter what I do to my diet (add calories, remove calories, add carbs, add sugar, reduce training), and my postrprandial never goes beyond 143 even when I have a ""test"" dessert fest, and I never go below 80, makes me believe that it's not t1 or t2 diabetes. Perhaps I'm severely overtrained and need more time? Though, I have good muscular recovery, am ""pumped"" by the thought of exercising (still motivated), make progress in the gym (I achieve my goals, whatever they may be, in reasonable time) and feel the opiates post-workout make me think that overtraining is less likely. Plus, the fact that my numbers haven't changed over the past 2 weeks...? Maybe I'm still not getting enough calories and need to continue to up them? Some people on low carb forums state that it takes them 3+ weeks for their FBG to normalize after adding carbs back in. Maybe I should give it another week or two? Maybe I need to change my final meal timing / size / macronutrient composition, to prevent gluconeogenesis during my sleeping fast? Though, I have tried lots of honey/cottage cheese/nuts just before bed with no effect. Maybe I'm totally off and it's something else altogether?"
AdvancedFitness,2udotx,Furthur,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:06:13 2015 UTC,"welp, you did the right thing be eating more carbohydrate. low CHO is not the diet of an athlete. period.  People really need to understand that they are fucking with very sensitive feedback loops when they set out on these weight loss crashes.  So first off, the long term training with low CHO might have caused downregulation of the GLUT4 receptor, it doesn't see much, doesn't need to be there to bring it in.  Same goes for insulin production, if you aren't causing it's release it shuts itself down.  HRV being heart rate variability? What method are you using? RR interval or just an increase or decrease?  I wouldn't be alarmed by either of your A1C or FBG numbers, maybe if insulin sensitivity is your concern to a fasted oral glucose tolerance test as that would be a better demonstrable test for your systems response to a glucose bolus.  And yes, you're talking genetic manipulation when you take something like glucose out of your diet, it will take a bit for your body to resume or upregulate the processes again.  I really doubt you are over trained so much as under fed. those are thousand calorie workout sessions in some cases and RMR is probably 1600-1800kcals on top of that AND your normal daily activity which could be another 1000.  Eating before bed might be something to check in on if your metabolism is so seemingly active, do you notice if you're warm or heat up as you sleep?   Keep on with the HRV testing, try a morning step test and resting rate assessment and continue to log them.  and more than anything, take a break every once in a while, you seem like you're working yourself to death!  7 days a week isn't something even the elites do, you have to give yourself rest and recovery."

It's fine if you are, Fit30+ has some members much stronger than that and some with impressive aesthetic results, but they don't drown out discussions about recovery and family or (GASP!) doing cardio by simultaneously imposing their powerlift progress as everyone else's goals (with powerlifts from < 3 years of training that would often barely be competitive at a regional level anyway).

There are all sorts of changes associated with aging, and they definitely change (decrease) your response to training. Testosterone and GH decrease (a rule of thumb on the latter is by half every 7 years). You have less anabolic capacity, which makes it harder to repair and build muscle.  Quality and duration of sleep also tend to decrease."

AdvancedFitness,2u8wjg,tadawdy,1 point,Sat Jan 31 00:00:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sleep quality is partially a function of habits, and those will vary.  Lowered anabolic capacity is just a blunt way of saying you can't grow or repair tissues as fast (or produce proteins or other cell components quickly), resulting partially from having less of things like GH (and IGF) and T floating around. GH release is pulsatile and these pulses become less regular and smaller in amplitude, for example (the number I quoted came from Giustina and Veldhuis, Endocrine Reviews, 19:717-797, 1998).   That plasma IGF-1 concentrations fall as a consequence of decreased GH secretion (Carter et al, Trends in Genetics, 2002) is not at all surprising.  Really, now we're talking about aging. It's truly impossible to pin the problems we associate with aging on any one thing, but hormone levels associated with growth and repair (as well as heath and number of available of progenitor cells) are certainly important."

AdvancedFitness,2ttpee,StoicLife,1 point,Tue Jan 27 15:09:26 2015 UTC,Yes you are correct.  I was talking about keeping my sets and reps exactly the same per week but spreading them out over 6 days instead of 3.
AdvancedFitness,2ttpee,incredulitor,2,Tue Jan 27 19:52:39 2015 UTC,"Ivan Abadjiev [pdf] was pretty damn successful coaching the Bulgarian weightlifting team based on very high frequency.  The ""science"" behind the Bulgarian method might not be completely up to date, but it works.  For best results, you might want to replace most of the fluids in your body with steroids.  Up to 9 or so one hour workouts a week is doable even natty though, with other constraints on reps per set, rest time, etc.  Google Scholar has more (references to Chinese-style training are also relevant)."
AdvancedFitness,2ttpee,Ballaticianaire,2,Wed Jan 28 14:29:55 2015 UTC,"Well of course it would. I'm too busy to find a study but it's obviously true purely from the standpoint of observing elevations in protein synthesis from a single bout of training. It follows logically that if protein synthesis levels decline from 48-72hrs post training, training again within that attenuated period will elevate them back up again for a couple of days. That fact + general myogenic gene expression modalities being elevated longer/more sustained are huge reasons for upping frequency, even if keeping volume the same. There's no possible way that a high volume routine (unequivocally optimal for hypertrophy), say 30 sets for a body part, done in 1 day vs spread across 2, is the same. That's where diminishing returns comes to play and why upping frequency has exceedingly more merit."
AdvancedFitness,2ttpee,jokerbot,4,Thu Jan 29 02:41:17 2015 UTC,"This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but I think it's a decent starting point.  You might be interested in some of Layne Norton's podcasts--he frequently talks about training volume based on the studies he reads.  I'd like to make a pedantic point.  You're probably more interested in studies that report on muscle mass or strength increases than changes in muscle protein synthesis.  They are related but are not directly proportional (e.g. a two-fold increase in muscle protein synthesis does not equate to two-fold increase in progress)."

AdvancedFitness,2trnbl,d1ez3,3,Mon Jan 26 21:54:27 2015 UTC,"I'm training for powerlifting. Recently I've been running an entire 5/3/1 cycle for two competition lifts in a week, then the other two lifts the following week, repeating. It's been nice, as it keeps me from squatting and benching the same week (one-way trip to shoulder flare ups for me) and the frequency really helps my technique.  This next week I'm changing up the intensity progression, doing a more clear DUP scheme while still rotating the lifts as before. I'll work up to a 9-9.5 RPE single the first session, then hit volume at 75% and 85% of that single during the other sessions, with an accessory day at the end. I'm looking to get more volume in overall with this plan, perhaps with a little less wear and tear.  My next real meet is at the end of April, where I hope to hit close to an 1800 lbs raw total. Goals after that include 700 raw squat, 400 raw bench, 750 raw deadlift, and 800 single ply deadlift. Hopefully all this year."

Squats, OHP, bench, (light-ish) deficit deadlifts, weighted-chin ups, light weighted pull-ups, and hip thrusts, all hit twice a week on opposite days for enough rest. I also do additional accessories for arms/triceps/shoulders/chest/legs/calves. Goal is a hybrid of strength and hypertrophy. The only reason I can get away with such high frequency is because I am loading in micro-increments (0.5-1.5 lb.) each workout."
AdvancedFitness,2trnbl,anu_yorker,3,Tue Jan 27 06:41:23 2015 UTC,"27 year old female endurance athlete here. Training for my second half-ironman this summer, as well as preparing for a few ultra races in the fall.  Currently I'm in maintenance/base mode, and I'll begin to increase in volume and intensity throughout the spring.  Exercising 5-6 days per week, and my routine consists of 1-3 hours of cardio (alternating between HIIT, MISS, LISS) and 20-45 minutes of strength training per session. I prefer to perform cardio beforehand since this is my focus, and the area in which I'd like to dedicate most of my glycogen stores. Cardio consists of road running, trail running, treadmill tempo runs, elliptical, swimming, and the spin bike for now as the roads here in the northeast US are covered in several feet of snow.  A long term goal for me is to develop my athleticism while supporting optimal health; I've found this can be difficult to master sometimes when training volume is high. Generally I'm looking to improve speed, as endurance comes somewhat easily to me. As a female, I've found that as I increase volume, my weight also increases, so it can be tough to balance mileage with power and speed. I've read quite a few studies that suggest that women may respond very differently to chronic endurance exercise in comparison with men, in the sense that they may be more primed to go into a survival mode from a hormonal standpoint. I've found this to be true with me, so I'm still looking to find that tricky balance where I can keep all my plates spinning at once."

AdvancedFitness,2trnbl,aManPerson,7,Wed Feb 4 05:05:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a 20-year-old rugby player. I lift on an upper/lower schedule(I just switched from push/pull); I am currently losing fat and gaining strength using Lyle McDonald's UD 2.0. I try to structure my workouts and diet to be rested and fresh for my matches every Saturday.  This is my schedule. My HIIT workout is on there as well as an explanation of my diet, and my supplement regimen. I do my cardio on a rowing machine or swimming. I supplement heavily during weight-loss phases and sparsely during weight-gain phases.  Here is an outline of my warm-up and cool-down - my prehabilitation. I typically do about half of the exercises, depending on what is hurting or tight(there's always something.)  This is my current lifting program. I wrote this based on Prilepin's table, here's the explanation. (Basically I drew a line of best fit for Prilepin's values and filled in the gaps between the intensity ranges.)  I only have an input for High-bar Squat at the moment, because my maxes for the other exercises will be determined over the course of this week. I've just switched programs and most of my exercises.  This is an analysis of a study done on elite rugby players, from which I try to pull some data, including my current HIIT program.  Oh, and I am 5'10"", 205lbs at 12% body fat, I play hooker and center, and my squat/bench/dead are 450/530/320. Edit: 450/320/530"

(i'm trying to find a happy medium of how anal retentive i need to be).  to be more strict and used to hitting my macros i'm measuring and making sure i'm getting 13oz of chicken, or 19oz of chicken, however much more i need.  also, you mean 1/2 a sweet potato or 1/2 a cup of rice?  and they're only 10g of carbs?  really?  that just sounds low to me."

And my rice mix is a combination of lentils, Brown rice, and quinoa in equal proportions, of which I eat half a cup on deficit days, yes.   As far as the attention to detail, you're right, I've found an effective medium. After weighing things and calculating calories for a while, I've come to a point where I can be sure of the relative macros of the meals I make, since I always buy the same food and brands.   On my deficit days, my calories are so low in relation to my maintenance level, that I know I'm burning fat. Whether I'm 100 calories higher or lower than my plan is of little consequence. On those days I typically have 2 meals with lean protein and low-calorie vegetables, 1 meal with lean protein and a small portion of a starchy vegetable, and 1 meal of lean protein with half a cup of my rice mix.   Then on maintenance days it's typically larger portions of starchy vegetables with two meals and a cup of rice mix with 2 meals.  On carb-load phases I usually cheat with some junk food, which ironically requires more calorie counting."

No. The business about burning calories from fat vs whatever during cardio is pretty meaningless. You want to look at total energy balance. Your body will fill fat stores back up if it has the energy or pull energy from fat stores if you burn up ""non fat"" calories after you exercise anyway. Energy is constantly going in & out of fat, it's not locked away only to be released if your HR is in a certain range during cardio. Net fat loss (or gain) is just the balance of countless energy micro-transactions at the end of the day.   I want to try and limit muscle loss as much as possible.    This has little to do with cardio and more to do with your resistance training. Keep intensity as high as you can but you can probably get away with cutting up to 2/3 of your volume if necessary. You probably want to lift within a couple hours of a protein-heavy meal (don't lift at 6am and then only eat between 12pm-8pm, for instance)   eating 300 calories below maintenance   This is a really mild deficit, like maybe 2-3 pounds a month loss. If you're struggling with this, and you want to lose 4-5% BF, you should probably experiment to find a more sustainable / comfortable regimen. That may mean a different carb/fat ratio, that may mean more fiber, that may mean more cardio and more food, that may mean less cardio and less food. Everybody's different so I can't say what'll work for you but unless you're very lean already you should probably be able to find a way to make a 300 calorie deficit pretty painless."
AdvancedFitness,2tpqhe,JSCMI,6,Mon Jan 26 13:33:02 2015 UTC,"The business about burning calories from fat vs whatever during cardio is pretty meaningless. You want to look at total energy balance. Your body will fill fat stores back up if it has the energy or pull energy from fat stores if you burn up ""non fat"" calories after you exercise anyway   slow down there cowboy, that's not entirely true.  you don't fill fat stores if you're in energy balance or in negative energy balance. The only replenishment of fuel storage is liver and muscle glycogen if you are IN balance or negative. glycogenesis.   (don't lift at 6am and then only eat between 12pm-8pm, for instance)   which is completely bogus as you'd still be in positive nitrogen balance had you eaten before bed AND you're missing out on peak testosterone production in men to peak your post-exercise MPS anabolic window when you can EASILY upregulate MPS with that additional test availability.  300kcal deficit is well within your daily %error in activity and probably unsubstantial in terms of weight loss/gain for OP considering he is doing resistance training and aerobic conditioning."
AdvancedFitness,2tpqhe,Furthur,3,Tue Jan 27 01:32:40 2015 UTC,"you don't fill fat stores if you're in energy balance or in negative energy balance. The only replenishment of fuel storage is liver and muscle glycogen if you are IN balance or negative. glycogenesis.   In practice, isn't this still going to be a function of energy balance across days or weeks rather than HR range during cardio? Or are you saying a trainee could burn significantly more fat during exercise and then allow ingested calories to support significantly more protein synthesis?   If the latter is the case, I'd love to get more info.    which is completely bogus as you'd still be in positive nitrogen balance had you eaten before bed AND you're missing out on peak testosterone production in men to peak your post-exercise MPS anabolic window when you can EASILY upregulate MPS with that additional test availability.   I agree it would be bogus to say you couldn't make progress, but that doesn't make fasted training without post-workout nutrition similarly effective to training around protein consumption. Trials on this are famously lacking but not entirely absent. Crib & Hayes, 2006 (abstract, full text) is an example I like because the group with inferior results also supplemented dietary protein, just not around training time. Also it's dealing with trained individuals.   The study I linked is arguably bit cherry picked but it's difficult to find one without limitations so severe they're irrelevant to the question of timing specifically. There are trials that show timing matters that mis-match protein intake and there are trials whose design is inadequate to measure differences in the study's timeframe. The only other trial I'm aware of is this 2001 study which is in untrained elderly men."
AdvancedFitness,2tpqhe,JSCMI,3,Tue Jan 27 13:03:33 2015 UTC,"Relative contributions from fuel sources are what makes this happen. I work in an energy balance study currently and while it's observational it's an assessment of diet vs. exercise for a half dozen descriptors.  Simple fact is, while fat is a metabolically active tissue it's not doing anything for you outside of causing inflammation and positive feedback loops to progenerate itself.  Simply said fat mobilization for exercise is a function of activating hormone sensitive lipase which is triggered BY exercise.  HR range during aerobic exercise is used as a marketing ploy by the equipment makers. It's not un-true, it's just not efficient to go by their terms. For the lay person it's fine but if i'm trying to torch a lb of fat i'm not going to spend 20 hours walking on a treadmill at 2mph for a 4000kcal workout below carbohydrate utilization thresholds.  The biggest issue in weight loss and behavior change is indeed consistency of that behavior or over the course of weeks.  At a given percentage of maximal effort (75% VO2max) you will utilize a nearly equal relative contribution of fat and carbohydrate for aerobic metabolism.  RER = .85ish.  You can maintain this effort typically for 90-120min before endangering your own ability to maintain blood glucose for your brain never mind that you are going to bonk soon too. See the paper I linked elsewhere in this thread.  If you push those thresholds for those times your body will prioritize glycogen resynthesis, liver comes first and can utilize glycerol backbones from free fatty acids and then muscle glycogen.  Liver is the safety net in these terms because muscle glycogen can't be used to keep blood glucose up for the brain.  Average dude has about 300g in his muscle and liver is about 100g which is good for about 1500kcal of exercise, 15miles on food or 45miles on a bike without additional CHO supplementation.  You ditch this appropriately and the contribution from fat will be about 30% of that in kcals (respiratory exchange ratio at 0.85) and you're looking at weight loss from endogenous stores, not just water weight.  so the Cribb study.. that is a REALLY big leap of faith to take in the methods.  23 male body builders with NO ergogenic aids in the previous 12 weeks? riiiiight.  Besides the pretty ridiculous confounder (really surprised it got published in MSSE) the intervention is pretty obviously unfit for people seeking to gain lean mass.  early morning and night supplementation is damn close to a normal diet, wake up, have some eggs and toast then get about your day. CR-monohydrate supplementation benefits are based more on the exercise regimen than the fact they you're doing exercise at all. The basics of the PCR system in bioenergetics should make that apparent.  Another confounder of that study is the structured program details. These studies are usually populated by local gym rats or college kids and odds are they aren't optimizing their training sessions well to begin with. It's an assumption but has merit.  They also didn't control for age which would be important when talking about MPS in young males. 25 is the make it or break it year, it's downhill from there. Of course none of their descriptives were significantly different from each other but it seems like they ran that comparison just for the hell of it. I won't pick apart their methods though that isn't the point of the chat.  That study confirms what i said in that protein timing is important but more so during the anabolic window, having AA available when MPS is upregulated is the key.  Nitrogen balance fluctuates ALL day from positive to negative and over the course of a week it changes the same way.  I suggest looking into what nitrogen balance means instead of general energy balance.  The results weren't AS good as the pre-post group (duh) but they still gained.  There are a TON of questions about that study i'd have if it was presented in front of me. It's REALLY hard to keep things controlled with that kind of study which makes me very skeptical of the integrity. it's old enough that it might have been something fresh as nobody cared about their question in 2006, this aspect of sport science was just starting to get funding because that money had always been in tied up in cancer cachexia and sarcopenia. That's where the aussies are better than the states for sure.  your direction isn't wrong, your terminology is. Nitrogen balance is the key word here.  Protein timing and other phrases are new ideas.  I've been up for 48 hours and a bit scattered, hope some of this makes things easier to understand."

In theory, training in a fasted state could result in a mild state of glycogen depletion forcing your body to utilize fat and amino acids a bit more. If you do train fasted I recommend supplementing with 5-10 grams of bcaa's first. This way, your body will be able to access them without tapping into the proteins you've already stored to get them.

Where nutrition does come in is that the body is able to use carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in various interlocking pathways in order to gain the energy needed for this recycling.

Also, training history will play a huge part in this; if you train yourself to do the same compound exercises daily, you will begin to recover more quickly (this probably covers at least part of the hugely varied inter-personal differences).

It's when one is a beginner or intermediate that they can squat every other day. Once they hit advance/elite levels of strength on the lift, they won't be able to sustain that intensity for every other day. I believe this is why you were downvoted.

Ever think he didn't consider this basic /r/Fitness material? Maybe you should chill out, even attempt to answer his question or, least of all, read the side bar.   This reddit is a place to learn, teach, and share information on the myriad ways we all work to improve our health and fitness, and achieve our training goals. Primarily aimed at non-beginners, though all are welcome.   Given the niche audience of this sub and its more intellectual nature I'd figure people would be a bit more mature about things that seemed out of place. Though I'm no expert no the matter, I believe that /u/JSCME has the right idea. Periodization, the idea of changing workloads and intensities to vary the stress on the body, is what /u/GDMisfits is looking for.  It isn't an easy training regimen to follow but here is what you'll need. Now, I have no idea if this is everything OP will need but given the fact that it refers to itself as a 'bible' it should be fairly comprehensive.  To more directly answer OP's question, I'd say that over training inhibits anabolism.

The actual grams of protein needed or that is optimal is debatable but basically you need to be consuming enough calories so that your body does not need the protein for energy and can use it for muscle building/repair. Then the grams of protein you are consuming need to be more than the daily amount your body needs for protein turnover.    The ranges I like and have seen the most are 0.8-1.2 g/kg for the normal population, 1.2-1.4 g/kg for endurance atheletes, and 1.6-1.8 g/kg for strength athletes."
AdvancedFitness,2tajcy,anomalyupinhere,2,Thu Jan 22 15:52:26 2015 UTC,if we use my example of pure lean mass a 454g then it's 454g*4kcal/g/pro ~1800kcal surplus per week.  You are right in quoting the acsm current specs on maintenance of lean tissue though.

AdvancedFitness,2tajcy,Furthur,2,Fri Jan 23 00:57:18 2015 UTC,A study was done to see the effect of muscle protein synthesis with and without carbs and a protein source. MPS was activated with or without carbs and a protein shake post workout.   If you do not eat carbs you can still build muscle. I have found most studies that look at protein ingestion always include carbs. Only the one study I have seen tested without carbs. If you do need carbs then the amount is extremely low since while on a ketogenic diet you can build muscle. I do not think any studies exist to say how many carbs you need to build muscle or that tackles the question. Most just tackle the protein side of things.
AdvancedFitness,2tajcy,Teekam,0,Thu Jan 22 19:33:24 2015 UTC,yes MPS happens if their is available nitrogen with the exercise stimulus. The difference is that it's rate limited by transport into the cell.. nevermind the nucleus for gene upregulation.  if you want to maximize the potential AA pool you eat it with CHO.  I've linked the study you are referring to here before.
AdvancedFitness,2tajcy,Furthur,2,Fri Jan 23 01:29:32 2015 UTC,"Well.. Considering a pound of muscle is ~454g.. That's wet weight I believe.  The RDAs are built on averages, the only thing you need to know is that current evidence supports a CHO/PRO mix of 4:1 or 3:1 for recovery and that protein timing is based on around the clock nitrogen balance and amino acid availability not chugging 60g after a workout.  There is no evidence that anything greater than 2.0g/kg does anything beneficial and the source of the protein is preferred to be egg or casein/whey according to the PDCAAS.  Edit: forgot; the reason you want to eat a cho/pro blend is to maximize the insulin response to the food for uptake.  Both glut 4 and carnitine transport get saturated this way."
AdvancedFitness,2tajcy,e_n_t_r_0_p_y,14,Thu Jan 22 16:25:38 2015 UTC,A pound of anything is 454g...
AdvancedFitness,2tajcy,MyStepdadHitsMe,2,Thu Jan 22 22:02:02 2015 UTC,amazing isn't it.  when we start teaching this to undergrads we use this number to put in their minds how much protein the composition of 454g of muscle is in terms of amino acids.  divide that by 7 and you get a very rough estimate of what it takes to ROUGHLY gain 1lb of lean mass. edit.. 1lb per week.

AdvancedFitness,2t6zo6,JSCMI,5,Wed Jan 21 18:12:26 2015 UTC,"""Beyond beginner stages"" and ""advanced"" are troublesome because they're ambiguous. They will always imply a certain level of performance or progression. You might have to get away from the beginner-intermediate-advanced descriptors in the rule text to avoid the ambiguity.  Example: ""All posts must be specific to fitness and promote discussion beyond the introductory levels on the topic""  ""Posts covering or seeking information related to beginner-level topics will be removed and are better suited for /r/Fitness"" is similarly problematic. Lots of great AF discussion is on beginner-level topics. To get away from beginner again how about: ""Posts regarding information at the introductory level will be removed and are better suited for /r/Fitness.""   Bottom line: I think trying to base a definition of ""advanced"" on ""not beginner"" is like trying to define ""better"" as ""not worse."" It might be true, but it's not clear.

Regardless, I think the fat burning advantages of ketosis are exaggerated and minimal at best.  What I DID find, for me at least, was fasting for 16 hours and having 1-2 normal meals was a lot easier to maintain (and lose 46lbs net) than 4-6 small meals.  And it was also a lot more socially manageable. Most people want to go out and grab dinner or drinks.

AdvancedFitness,2sj4k6,100_percent_diesel,2,Fri Jan 16 02:31:15 2015 UTC,"Wow. Go figure. Simply corroborating what we already know - meal freq doesn't matter to an overtly appreciable amount, at least in terms of strictly body composition.   Notwithstanding, if we're going to talk about purely muscle-building, there is some evidence from studies done on rates of protein synthesis giving fewer, larger boluses of protein versus more frequent, smaller boluses, that protein synthesis rates are higher in the latter group, lending credence toward increased meal frequency for optimal gains. However, this should be interpreted with caution as strictly measuring a marginal difference in protein synthesis rates doesn't really indicate too much (that we're aware of) about long-term hypertrophy. The picture is far too convoluted to simply state that, plus the theory of parsimony doesn't really work when no causal relation has been conclusively inferred, and when we know there are so many other complex interactions occurring.   Furthermore, the recent robust study done on time-restricted feeding in rats actually hinted at a greater efficacy of amino acid utilization towards protein synthesis via higher expression & protein levels of p70s6k during the feeding period (downstream mTOR player that initiates ribosomal biogenesis), lower levels of gluconeogenesis, and differential circulating levels of AAs. It convolutes the picture further.   In terms of actual health, not strictly body composition or hypertrophy, it's pretty unequivocal by this point that a time-restricted feeding/intermittent fasting protocol seems to be far superior. To avoid going on a long, molecular-oriented rant, I think it could be simplified as a chronic upregulation of mTOR pathways via constant feeding and conversely, too little expression of catabolic pathways (think of a metabolic seesaw perhaps, mTOR vs AMPK, though that's a gross oversimplification as well). For instance, with that, there was an interesting study here:   http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.27149/full  That essentially found that the higher meal freq group had increased levels of hepatic triglyceride accretion when both groups were fed an isocaloric diet. This stands in line with mechanistic expectation. Again though, nothing too concrete can be said from one study like this, as well as the influence of the participant intake being self-reported, which is a known issue."

We have evolved to our current physical and mental status due to the roles we played in the past. Men=Physical prowess, aggression, and bravery (or stupidity). Women=Better ability to recognize threats as well as potential benefits, better ability to ""read"" the emotions of others, and the capability to fucking create new human beings (how is that not the coolest thing ever)."

AdvancedFitness,2sflr0,aManPerson,3,Wed Jan 14 23:36:15 2015 UTC,"Emphasis mine.  Abstract: In most situations involving a significant change in body weight, both fat-free body mass (FFM) and body fat participate, but the relative contribution of FFM and fat to the total weight change is influenced by the initial body fat content.   Overfeeding: In experiments of at least 3-weeks' duration, the weight gain of thin people comprises 60–70% lean tissues, whereas in the obese it is 30–40%.   Underfeeding: In humans, there is an inverse curvilinear relationship between initial body fat content and the proportion of weight loss consisting of lean tissue.  The same trend holds for animals and birds, including loss during hibernation.  Another factor is the magnitude of the energy deficit: as energy intake is reduced, lean tissue makes up an increasing fraction of the total weight loss.   Exercise: If individuals lose much weight with exercise, the result is usually some loss of lean tissue as well as fat, and once again the proportion of lean loss to total weight loss is greater in thin people than in those who have larger body fat burdens.  Members of twin pairs often differ in weight. In thin individuals, lean accounts for about half of the intrapair weight difference, whereas in the obese it accounts for only one quarter.  Body fat content must be taken into account in evaluating body composition changes induced by nutrition and exercise."
AdvancedFitness,2sflr0,aManPerson,1 point,Wed Jan 14 23:39:20 2015 UTC,"Overfeeding: In experiments of at least 3-weeks' duration, the weight gain of thin people comprises 60–70% lean tissues, whereas in the obese it is 30–40%.   To be clear, the subjects' initial state of either thin or obese was based on their ad libidum body composition before overfeeding? (""naturally"" thin or obese, for lack of better word)  Or were some obese dieted down to thin and some thin overfed to obese?  I ask because without that control the groups have a huge selection bias that is almost certainly directly related to the experiment.   Wouldn't the more likely conclusion be somewhat circular, that ""naturally"" lean people tend to stay lean and ""naturally"" obese people tend to gain fat? In this context, ""naturally"" could include any number of environmental or dietary habits that were not controlled in the study (i.e. more than genetics).   It seems like people want to draw the conclusion that someone who is obese and diets down will gain proportionately more lean mass when they overfeed from a thin state, and that as someone accumulates fat mass the proportion of lean mass they build will lessen as they approach or attain an obese state.    That is a conclusion about changes within an individual based on their body composition at any given time, rather than a conclusion about whether there is individual variation in the proportion of lean mass accreted while overfeeding.   It seems like this study more likely tests the former but makes a conclusion about the latter.   Again- unless some obese dieted down to thin and some thin overfed to obese to control for this."

The only conclusion they draw is:   Body fat content must be taken into account in evaluating body composition changes induced by nutrition and exercise"

BECAUSE a lean person more easily looses LBM, if i was 220, and still had 200lbs of LBM, would it be a good idea to have more protein, in an attempt to make it easier for my body to maintain it's LBM?  in a round about way, given the conclusion, how should one move forward?"
AdvancedFitness,2sflr0,JSCMI,1 point,Wed Jan 21 08:32:14 2015 UTC,"your question ""what happens if you diet down an obese person, and perform these same overfeeding/underfeeding tests"", i think it's based on the idea that the person is obese from an underlying medical condition, like hypothroidisim.  as opposed to someone who has a normal functioning body, but chose to continuously overfeed.  say, for emotional reasons.  but i see what you're getting at, ""does becoming obese permanently alter how the body responds to over/underfeeding."""
AdvancedFitness,2sflr0,aManPerson,1 point,Wed Jan 21 08:28:51 2015 UTC,"i think it's based on the idea that the person is obese from an underlying medical condition, like hypothroidisim. as opposed to someone who has a normal functioning body, but chose to continuously overfeed. say, for emotional reasons.   I want to account for many reasons someone might be lean or not, but this is probably not going to one of them. I know you're just throwing out an example but it's a common one so I want to respond to it directly. According to the American Thyroid Association, ""In general, 5-10 pounds of body weight may be attributable to the thyroid, depending on the severity of the hypothyroidism"" (source) which is not going to account for anyone being lean vs obese. I might be 15% instead of 12% if I have a thyroid problem, but I'm not going to be 30+%.    as opposed to someone who has a normal functioning body, but chose to continuously overfeed. say, for emotional reasons.   While this certainly happens, this neglects a tremendous amount of variability within the boundaries of ""normal functioning body"" - we know, for instance, that not all people given the same nutrition and training protocol will respond the same way. Even among people with normal body function they will develop different body compositions. Hell, a small number of people seem to be ""non-responders"" to resistance training (and variances of 100% in response proportion are relatively common).   Food availability also has a role. A college student, a young professional, and an unskilled laborer will often have different diets, even with similar emotional relationships with food. Different cultural upbringings will also have a huge impact on this. I'm not (just) talking food quality but macronutrient composition and even one's impression of what overfeeding is will be influenced.   There are a lot of permutations on how individual variance and food interact too. We know for instance that insulin sensitivity and the fat/carb proportion can make a huge difference (link).    but i see what you're getting at, ""does becoming obese permanently alter how the body responds to over/underfeeding.""   This is yet another valid consideration. I've seen others point out that fat cells are replaced every 10 years therefore if you can keep the fat off 10 years you ""should"" lose the extra fat cells created. Is that true? Might they go away faster if they're not ""needed""? Or do they always get replaced once created and thus effectively remain forever? Does it matter what age you were fat? Does it matter how long?   What about muscle-building satellite cells? Brad Schoenfeld has talked about evidence that taking steroids might permanently increase satellite cells. Is this true? Does this mean even someone treated medically with steroids - say for physical rehabilitation - might permanently respond better to resistance training? Might people who had unusually high hormone levels in teen years also permanently respond better? Taking yet another logical step (or leap?) does this mean that sleep in adolescence might have a causative relationship with body composition for the rest of someone's life? Might a day be coming that the same age men start getting prostrate exams they're also given a (medically supervised) test blast to try and get some of those long-term benefits?   To be clear, I'm not suggesting any of the individual variance to diet or exercise is beyond someone's ability to adjust or regulate themselves, but there are a whole lot of open questions here. We know better adherence to nutrition and exercise will improve health and fitness, and the better we understand how to prep people's expectations and maximize their results the better adherence will be.   I think that boiling down the p-ratio issue to ""gaining weight while lean vs obese"" is just too simplistic to be useful. There are way too many reasons the people in this study may have been lean vs obese at the start that may also affect their body composition of weight gain."
AdvancedFitness,2sflr0,JSCMI,1 point,Wed Jan 21 13:08:51 2015 UTC,"(and this would be news to me), you're saying 99% of the people who are 50+ pounds overweight are only that fat because they eat too much?  not trying to be negative, i guess i just thought most all of them were not fat from just eating too much. right, lots of variance in how people use food and respond to different foods (fat cells in former obese person), that's one thing i wondered.  when i'm finished, i will probably have lost 300 pounds of body fat.  are 95% of those cells still there?  just deflated?  does that mean my body has 3L less blood in it?  since it's almost a certainty that i will need extra skin cutoff, will i have a bunch of veins and artery's that will need to be removed or tucked in elsewhere? ""medically supervised and induced test blast"", lol, a wonderful phrase (steroids), oh, interesting thought.  i could see that being the case.  ive read a number of times now how if you get 200 pounds of muscle and it took you 5 years to get there.  then do a cut and loose 20 pounds of LBM.  it won't take you another 5 years of overfeeding and overtraining to get back up there.  it might only take you 6 months.  the notion being, it's easy to get back to your maximum state.  so if steroids help increase your maximum state, you can more easily work your way back to it.   regardless, i will take this papers suggestion as ""you put on less body fat if you bulk from a lean state, as opposed to builking forever, then cutting forever"".  although really, i'm guessing a healthy cycle would be bulk for 4 months, cut for 2, forever."
AdvancedFitness,2sflr0,aManPerson,1 point,Thu Jan 22 01:26:52 2015 UTC,"you're saying 99% of the people who are 50+ pounds overweight are only that fat because they eat too much?   100% of people who are 50+ pounds overweight wouldn't be if they ate less. Fat is the store of excess energy. Eating less reduces the accumulation of excess energy. Whether someone might burn an abnormally low amount of energy or have an abnormally high appetite is irrelevant to that. The fundamental question of energy balance is well settled. You either consume less energy or you expend more, and in the case of 50+ pounds of excess fat it's likely both sides of the equation need attention.   This isn't an issue of personal judgment, just an underlying truth. Someone might say their metabolism is slow, or that they're abnormally hungry, or that they don't have access to adequate proteins and fibrous foods that are more satiating, but even valid explanations for why someone might be eating more than they need don't change the fact that eating more than they need accounts for the accumulation of fat.    when i'm finished, i will probably have lost 300 pounds of body fat. are 95% of those cells still there? just deflated?    We don't know the specifics, but there will certainly be deflated fat cells. Assuming ""unneeded"" fat cells disappear at some point, and since 300 pounds of fat is a years-long process (and incredible accomplishment!!!), then by the time the weight loss phase is over the process of reducing total fat cell ""census"" should be well underway. We also don't know how universal the answers are, how individual genetic variation factors in, whether there are set points established at developmental milestones, how much time & severity of obesity factor in, etc.   The better question is this: Does it matter? There are countless examples of people who lose weight and keep it off, proving that you can do it too. Think your loose skin won't go away even after a few years? Prove it. Measure and track. I promise you that your body will astound you in its ability to adapt.   does that mean my body has 3L less blood in it?    I have no idea on the amount. The answer will also depend on things like relative muscle mass at beginning vs end of weight loss phase.    since it's almost a certainty that i will need extra skin cutoff, will i have a bunch of veins and artery's that will need to be removed or tucked in elsewhere?   I have no idea on this either.    i will take this papers suggestion as ""you put on less body fat if you bulk from a lean state, as opposed to builking forever, then cutting forever"".   That conclusion is extremely common.   Here's the thing: To draw that conclusion we'd need to start with lean and obese individuals, make half the lean group fat and half the obese group lean, then bulk all now-four groups and compare the accretion of lean vs fat mass. If and only if the people who bulk while lean gain leaner mass than those who bulk while obese, regardless of their ""natural"" level of leanness, is there even some support for that conclusion. However, this paper does NOT perform that trial, therefore I argue that idea is still just speculation.  The only thing this paper shows is that if you pull random people off the street and put weight on them, proportionately leaner people tend to gain leaner weight and obese people tend to gain proportionately more fat. I posit that the most likely explanation is that they (the people in this trial) gained proportionately lean or fat weight for the exact same reason(s) they were lean or obese before the trial even started. It might be their protein intake, sleep habits, genetics, or most likely some combination of those factors and umpteen others.   Further, we actually have a clinical trial of people who were all dieted down to very lean from various body types and then monitored during a weight gain phase. It's the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. And while it's limited in how it translates to people who weight train with high protein diets, it does prove that different people gain different proportions of fat vs lean at the same level of body fat during a weight gain phase and it more strongly supports the ""body fat setpoint"" theory than the ""p-ratio is a function of % body fat"" theory.   i'm guessing a healthy cycle would be bulk for 4 months, cut for 2, forever.   Genuine question: What makes you think this would be healthy? Listen to this snippet for instance demonstrating what appears to be a causative relationship in rats between weight cycling and degradation of body composition.   Human data is correlative / observational, but there are ways to get some controls. In other words, people who diet more end up with more fat but this can't always be explained by the idea that some people may be ""naturally fat"" and that's why they diet more. As a for instance, this discussion of data regarding genetically identical twins with different dieting. Over their lifetimes, the one who attempted to diet more ended up with more total body fat.   There's also athlete data that those who diet to make weight classes vs those who don't finding that athletes who don't have to make a weight class avoid the degradation of body composition (significant tendency for more fat mass over time) and those who diet to make a weight class through their athletic career do experience the ""body fat overshooting.""   Also realize there's no evidence that bulk/cut cycles to a target weight accumulate lean/muscle mass any faster than eating a steady amount to approach the same target weight in the same timeframe. BBers cut is because they are judged at unsustainable and unhealthy levels of leanness they can't function at. The end of a BBer bulk is still incredibly lean by general population standards! Even if you are a (male) BBer then starting a bulk at body fat levels as high as even 12-15% is usually detrimental to competition.   If you have any evidence contrary to the above I'm very interested in seeing it, but from what I've been able to find the science has clues that bulking/cutting may not be a great idea while there is an absence of science supporting any benefit to bulking/cutting.   Given that, if your primary goal is long-term health, your best bet is probably to lose excess fat and then adopt dietary eating habits that you can comfortably sustain for the rest of your life.   At first blush, what I've written may seem discouraging. But having been overweight and out of shape myself, I promise you that if you control your fat mass and lift weights you will experience steady and wonderful improvements in body composition. In a few years people who didn't know you ""before"" will even remark on your good genetics and such because it's really easy to fall into the either the camp that genetics don't matter at all or that they determine everything. The reality is that guys like you and me may never be on the cover of Men's Fitness but we can still progress more than most people realize is possible for ""average or below-average genetics"" and live long, healthy, high-quality lives."

I have no idea on the amount. The answer will also depend on things like relative muscle mass at beginning vs end of weight loss phase.   yes, i'm sure i will have increased muscle mass, but i was just more thinking about total human volume.  would my body naturally regulate to having less blood due to the smaller size?  or will all of the vascular systems in place, still completely exist, therefore not reducing the total ""network"" of places blood could go.  if the total blood network did shrink, with the same total blood volume, that would mean a huge increase in blood pressure.  so i would have to think my body would regulate to have less blood, to try and maintain it's desired fluid pressure.   gained proportionately lean or fat weight for the exact same reason(s) they were lean or obese before the trial even started   agreed.  obese people generally are not short on glycogen, which means their muscles are insulin resistant.  so they most common way to deal with excess serum glucose, is to store it as body fat.    Minnesota Starvation Experiment   shit ass god dammit.  that is not news i wanted to hear.  on the other hand, i am the only ""huge"" person in my family.  most everyone else only has about 25 pounds of bodyfat, and around 200 pounds.  so i'm not genetically fucked, but i've been fat, nearly all my life, and 300+ pounds for the last 15.  it sounds like my body will have a predisposition to be fat.  cool :/.   What makes you think this would be healthy?  (lean/bulking cycles)   i suppose what i was thinking, periods of time with eating discipline, and lack of or lesser discipline.  at least right now, i dont ever think i NOT want to sit down and eat a whole detroit style pizza with a half gallon of chocolate milk.  but it is a ""bad"" event for ones body.  i would still like to do something like that every now and then.  i realized eating correctly, maintenance calories is a better approach, but i think i'm being realistic here in thinking that i would like to go overboard every once in a great while.  i'm also seeing a therapist to work through this.  ive learned i use food as an anti anxiety.  so take away your simple anti anxiety, and everything is terrible and worrysome all the time.  its pretty shitty to be going around, essentially, a little scared and frightened all the time.  like having 10% of a fight or flight response on at all times.  at times i just want to get away from everyone, dam near hide in a dark cave (a basement with a computer) and just relax/settle down.  she too was confused/thought it was a terrible idea when i brought up the notion of planning a cheat day or two after 6 months of great success on a diet.  i realize, for an alcoholic, that would be a stupid stupid thing to do.  but food isn't like alcohol.  you can go the rest of your life without having alcohol, and you wont die.  you need food to live, you're probably going to eat every day.  i suppose it ultimately comes down to: food has been a great comforting factor in my life.  to think i NEED to exist without that?  it scares me, it worries me, i'm getting nervous about it just typing this out.  even when i expressed interested and said that i would probably be fine not eating much if i was fucking someone all day, therapist still just brushed that off as me using something to distract myself from negative feelings.    short of getting some anti anxiety medication, which i'm not opposed to, i dont know what else i'm supposed to do about this.  hence, 4 months of good, healthy dieting, i didnt think was so horrible to eat a whole KFC family meal twice a year."
AdvancedFitness,2sflr0,mediamonk,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:54:18 2015 UTC,"Your body is going to regulate its blood volume, etc, so it's all good. Blood pressure typically drops to improved levels when body fat is brought down to healthier levels. Your body is fantastic at adapting and regulating itself. There are some aspects like excess skin does take a long time to go away but it's not going to hurt you.    obese people generally are not short on glycogen, which means their muscles are insulin resistant. so they most common way to deal with excess serum glucose, is to store it as body fat.    You may be interested in some of the info from Alan Aragon and Brad Schoenfeld regarding insulin resistance and sensitivity of muscle cells and compared to fat cells and the things that affect them (sometimes independently). Remember that lean, muscular people also carry lots of glycogen. The mechanisms you're mentioning are very, very broad and work through many different pathways so be careful of people who would cherry pick particular observations to suggest that the body works a certain way (which might indeed be true) while neglecting the countless other ways the body can accomplish the same thing.   When it comes to body composition, you can set your clock by the facts that total energy balance determine changes in mass and resistance training is the largest factor in influencing any given person's body fat vs muscle level for any given mass (barring a medical condition, of course). If you ever read something scienc-ey that doesn't jibe perfectly with those two facts take a long, skeptical look at it.    i've been fat, nearly all my life, and 300+ pounds for the last 15. it sounds like my body will have a predisposition to be fat. cool :/.   I wouldn't conclude that from the facts you've given. It sounds like you've lost a substantial amount of weight already. Are the changes you've made sustainable? If so, you're fine. If you're saying that your body will always have a predisposition to be fat when you overeat, then yes that is true of you and 100% of other people.    i dont ever think i NOT want to sit down and eat a whole detroit style pizza with a half gallon of chocolate milk   This is a great example of a habit everyone's body is ""predisposed to getting fat"" from. If you could consume that much for regular meals without getting fat I would worry there was something seriously wrong with you endocrinologically or something. The fact that you gain weight when you do this and lose weight when you eat better is an indication that you'll be a-okay.   On the side of psychological adherence, I'd assume even more strongly now that you'll function better in the long-term staying off bulk/cut cycles. If you don't already have a yard high stack of reading material you've been meaning to get to, I recommend checking out this book too which is written by nutrition and exercise professionals and gets a bit into this aspect of long-term health. Their conclusion, based on their expertise of available science, is that the general population's best bet is probably to figure out what the diet of their target body would be and then just eat that. As you approach your target weight your weight will change more slowly but who cares? This is the long game. If you figure, for instance, you want to land at 180 pounds and estimate that maintaining that will be 2,700 calories a day (as an example, the book walks you through how to get a better estimate for any given individual rather than just equating any given weight with a particular calorie intake) then eat 2,700 calories a day for 6 months and see what happens. You can enjoy the day to day better than trying to pursue weight loss more aggressively, you can make better progress in the gym, and best of all you're establishing habits that can be automatic which will make them easier to maintain than cut/bulk cycles and therefore less likely to have days where you say fuck it and eat a bucket of chicken. So anyway- after 6 months you're closer than where you started to your target, you're enjoying life, and you're probably able to eat much more intuitively. Your relationship with food can continue to improve over time and you're avoiding metabolic adaptations that may be setting you up for discomfort in trying to maintain adherence down the road.   Their recommendations involve macronutrient targets, soft food quality targets (as in targets are soft / have wiggle room, not soft food), advice about ""cheating"" urges, and so on. It's all very well grounded, practical, and yet still consistent with pretty much every nutrition paper that has come up here in AF. They talk about how there are so many different diets that can work (whether keto, paleo, IIFYM, etc) because there are certain core attributes they share so they're all right, not because any particular one is magical. The author asks you to build your diet around your own favorite foods in a way that is consistent with those core attributes to get yourself on a sustainable plan that, in the long run, also happens to get you to your goals.   Anyway - that books seems like something that might be helpful to you so that's my description as to why.    and incredible accomplishment!!!  i had honestly never thought of it that way..................   Don't ever forget it, dude. Every healthy person is predisposed to getting fat with the food intake you've described. The better questions about obesity aren't why people get fat (it's because they eat too much) but rather how are habits to eat an appropriate amount of appropriate foods best established. People overeat for so many different reasons, though! If your reasons are being addressed in therapy then that's awesome and I'm not in any way qualified to second guess that. I'd just urge you to get plugged into the other half of this ""rehabilitation"" which is establishing sustainable, long-term, healthy eating (and exercise) habits. I don't think the conclusion people often make from study OP linked has any relevance to you at all.   Something else you may not have considered: You are going to have the pleasure of finding out how naturally lean your body is once you put enough time into feeding it the way your body wants to be fed instead of the way your anxiety was overfeeding it. It's probably going to be average because that's what average is, but it might be better too, and it's almost guaranteed not the ""naturally fat"" you've been under the impression of because of the non-physiological overfeeding tendencies that you're dealing with. Stick with it because every 6 months or so you're going to realize that your body is a whole hell of a lot better than you ever realized which is pretty exciting."

So, just to get this out of the way early, the VAST majority of the differences between men and women that are relevant to performance aren’t necessarily gender differences, but rather can be primarily explained by differences in body composition.    How is this all not essentially a gender difference, men produce far more testosterone than women by virtue of being men? Testosterone is a major factor in all these criteria? I'm not sure I understand the difference being made."
AdvancedFitness,2s88nb,datderebarbell,3,Tue Jan 13 16:28:15 2015 UTC,"Influence vs. causality  Sex (hormonal differences) --influence--> body size and composition  Body size and composition --cause--> metabolic rate and performance  So yes, sex differences certainly establish strong trends related to body size and composition and performance, but by and large the main contributing factor to metabolic rate and performance is body size, composition, and training status.  So when comparing individuals matched for those factors, sex isn't overly important.  When comparing groups of people (men vs. women) it is.  edit: yes, I know causality is a problematic term, so ""more directly contributes"" if you prefer."

AdvancedFitness,2s88nb,Rhiagg0,2,Tue Jan 13 21:21:49 2015 UTC,"The way I understand it is that they're describing gender trends. So you can have a woman who has a more androgenous body type/composition, and she would then perform more similarly to a typical man than a typical woman. Simply being a woman, then, doesn't have as much impact on performance without considering for body composition."
AdvancedFitness,2s88nb,grae313,2,Tue Jan 13 18:24:41 2015 UTC,"It seems like the lines aren't terribly well-defined. A woman who naturally has more testosterone and a resulting leaner composition will perform better. If she adds a little testosterone supplementation, the performance gap increases. Add a little more, a little more, wait long enough, and bam! She's a man.   Simply being a woman, then, doesn't have as much impact on performance without considering for body composition.   I think I see what you're trying to say, but I agree with datderebarell: body composition differences and hematocrit differences are very much gendered."

AdvancedFitness,2s88nb,the_hutch_touch,6,Tue Jan 13 15:24:07 2015 UTC,"Hematocrit and heart size factor in as well.  Also the amount of essential fat for women is ~12% vs. ~3% for men, so when comparing a man and woman who are equally ""lean"" (same amount of non-essential fat), the man will have ~9% more lean tissue."
AdvancedFitness,2s88nb,gnuckols,2,Tue Jan 13 17:34:19 2015 UTC,"So what explains the fundamental differences in body composition between men and women, if body composition is responsible for the majority of performance differences?   If hormones are the answer, then isn't the difference fundamentally one of gender?   I'm confused."
AdvancedFitness,2s88nb,the_hutch_touch,3,Tue Jan 13 18:02:37 2015 UTC,"Hormones are largely responsible for the difference in starting point (i.e. gender differences are minimal until puberty), and at the very elite levels they cap performance somewhat (since ~9% more essential fat), but the point was that if you take a man and woman who are the same size and same body composition, they'll perform very similarly.  So sex certainly influences those factors (size and body comp) but when looking at metabolic rate and performance the primary causal factors are ultimately size and body comp, not sex itself."
AdvancedFitness,2s88nb,gnuckols,1 point,Tue Jan 13 18:20:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding. According to Taylor, et al (1997), ""significant gender differences in body composition are evident, well before the onset of puberty.""   I have several more questions:  If size and body composition are the primary factors of performance differences between men and women, (and gender doesn't have an affect on this) wouldn't we see some women simply changing their body composition to compete in male dominated sports?  How do you explain the massive differences in average body comp between men and women if not due to gender?"
AdvancedFitness,2s88nb,the_hutch_touch,4,Tue Jan 13 19:25:31 2015 UTC,"Ahh, right you are.  I suppose the more precise way to say that is the bulk of the divergence occurs at puberty (i.e. small differences prior that are fairly static through childhood, then further divergence at puberty).  You're missing the point entirely.  YES, average body composition, aerobic performance, strength, etc. tends to vary between sexes (which I addressed first thing in the post), but average is the operative word.  If you take two people matched for size, body comp, muscle mass, training status etc. and one is XX and one is XY, their performance and metabolic rate will be pretty darn similar.  That's all I'm saying."
AdvancedFitness,2s88nb,gnuckols,1 point,Tue Jan 13 19:55:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't miss that point, but that's not all you are saying in the article.     Most of the major differences in performance and metabolism between genders can be explained by size and body composition, not gender itself.    But the size and body composition differences between men and women are DUE to gender. Here are some quotes from the Frontiers Journal you used to write the article that entirely support this:   substrate metabolism is subject to gender-specific regulation In biomedical research, it has become increasingly apparent that gender has a profound impact on metabolism An increasing body of evidence suggests that there is a distinct gender dimorphism in the intrinsic properties of skeletal muscle. There is an obvious gender difference in adiposity, which is present already at birth (46) and becomes more marked during puberty (47) A gender difference in muscle morphology has been well documented A gender difference in lipoprotein metabolism seems to be well established Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake appears to be higher in skeletal muscle of women than men, a finding that implies the relevance of studying gender differences in muscle glucose uptake and metabolism When studying substrate metabolism in men and women it is imperative to study how gender affects glucose and fat metabolism during the different metabolic situations of daily living, fluctuating between the prandial and postabsorptive state and periods with physical activity and recovery   In fact the concluding remarks say that more studies should be done on gender differences and how they relate to metabolism. The entire paper supports that gender differences are primary causal factors in metabolic differences.   edit: formatting"
AdvancedFitness,2s88nb,the_hutch_touch,1 point,Tue Jan 13 22:57:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of that...because that's literally what the entire rest of the article is about.

A woman and a man with similar training and similar amounts of muscle and fat will perform similarly.

AdvancedFitness,2s88nb,gnuckols,-2,Tue Jan 13 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"I don't see how this conclusion can be reached though. Certainly if this was the case then at some point in the history of all competitive sports a woman would have broke even with male athletes. However every sport that gauges speed,strength and endurance is overwhelmingly dominated by men with quite a significant gap in performance. In fact athletic teenage boys out perform female Olympic gold medalist and the very pinnacle of female atheletes are only comparable to the median of male atheletes at best.  Moreover how can this article claim that gender differences aren't that signifncant when the differences in body composition,muscle size,skeletal density,height and so on between men and women is largely the result or sexual dimorphism. Its like saying there isn't any physiological differences between a fox and a bear except the bear is just larger and more body mass. It's a roundabout way to avoid stating the obvious...as non-PC as it might be."
AdvancedFitness,2s88nb,Rhiagg0,3,Tue Jan 13 20:16:23 2015 UTC,"The fact that you shared this article in /r/mensrights with the title ""Article Claims There Is Little Gender Differences And That Women Are Physically Superior"" lets me know you missed the point and are just trying to start drama.  But here's how I responded over there:   Yes, there are strong trends for different size/strength/body composition between sexes. That's not even debateable. I'm not sure where the ""article claims there is little gender differences"" came from. It's acknowledged twice in the first few paragraphs. Nowhere did I say that women tend to be as strong as men. The claim was about strength per unit muscle mass. Which, again, is a very uncontroversial claim. It's basic muscle physiology. A bigger muscle is a stronger muscle, regardless of sex. Yes, men tend to have bigger muscles, so they tend to be stronger. The article does not contest that point at all. The fact that women tend to have better metabolic health isn't a very contentious one either. Better insulin sensitivity, lower rates of metabolic disease, faster triglyceride and VLDL clearance, etc. Again, that's a trend. Not a claim that every woman has better metabolic health than every man (just as there was no claim that every man is stronger than every woman)."

I also wasn't sure your distinction of the Westside method.  You just point out that they are advanced, going for PRs, etc., but don't explain why that means changing exercises works for them but not for mere mortals.  Your views on cardio don't seem to be science-based.  You use the extreme analogy of a marathon runner but ignore studies showing moderate LISS won't negatively impact hypertrophy.    I also wouldn't be so quick to write-off peri-workout nutrition.  I believe Schoenfeld's position is that currently the literature doesn't really support it, not that it's useless.  With re to carb supplementation, Scott Stevenson has written that he thinks it's useful due to cortisol suppression.  The thing I like about Schoenfeld in general is that he's a big science guy but he still keeps an open mind and doesn't discard traditional bro-wisdom out of hand.

AdvancedFitness,2s97nr,Birdoftruth,9,Tue Jan 13 06:16:29 2015 UTC,"The more I learn here, the less I worry everywhere else.   I went from thinking that I was incapable of building muscle (muh genetics!) to thinking that the basic guidelines prescribed to beginners with strict attitude was the only way to do to it. My view now is that people can progress, albeit in different ways to different degrees (and I doubt most people would believe what their genetic potential is!), and that the body is absolutely fantastic at making the most out of any training you give it, especially in the context of the general (untrained) population.   Information here I generally find to be liberating not because it illustrates what's important, but because of how many things it rules out. It's kind of both though, because a very small core set of important concepts come up repeatedly and it's hard to find examples of approaches using them that don't work, and adding complication seldom makes much (if any) difference, especially below very high levels of performance.  The pubmeds to some extent but especially the reviews and yes even the anecdotes and opinions of some of the knowledgeable and level-headed members here demonstrate there are a lot of right ways to be fit. How effective something is isn't proportionate with how painful it is to do, but nor is screwing around with a circuit of isolation movements going to be very time- or energy-efficient.   Specifics...  Like others have mentioned, I pay more attention to volume now.   I don't constantly worry about lifting a heavier weight. Constant 90-95% 1RM intensity is not intelligent training. But I don't expect to see progress hanging out at 50% intensity either. Understanding how to balance the needs for intensity, volume, and recovery is nuanced and individual and I think even studies with limitations due to design, subject age or training level, timeline, etc can help shed insight into how to examine your own training.   I feel more comfortable with how to watch macronutrition and fiber. There are levels that make a big difference, levels that might help a little more, and ranges where stressing about available food probably hurts you more than any potential optimization of levels would help.   Similarly, I watch a few micronutrient levels (like magnesium and potassium) and confidently disregard sales pitches for raspberry ketones or whatever.  I pay more attention to rest and sleep. Sleep and mental health is pretty easy to figure out intuitively but information here has opened my eyes to how deterministic the role is between sleep and body composition as well (I wonder how much of the controversy about alcohol and gains comes down to how much alcohol affects an individual's sleep)  Comfortable weight control probably has a hundred times more to do with appetite control than controlling metabolism. An individual's glucose metabolism has to match their macronutrient intake, fiber has to be considered, sleep affects this too, and the type of exercise for any given individual is important too but more in terms of how much it affects appetite than obsessing over how fast it burns calories.   I don't even know how to summarize anything I've learned about supplements so I'll just nod to /u/silverhydra's examine.com, say I take a few but only a few supplements, and leave it at that.   As a NON-advanced fitness trainee, and someone who has no professional or educational credentials in the arena of fitness, I've perhaps learned more in this sub or jumping off from this sub than some of the more established contributing members.

AdvancedFitness,2s9slc,ioiLeGeNDioi,8,Tue Jan 13 11:27:33 2015 UTC,"There are few things as indisputable in the strength game as proper workout supplementation. It's perfect logic and beyond that, it's perfect science.   I'll bite. Let's discuss the available science.  This research review is the best place to start that I'm aware of. It finds absolutely no benefit to peri-workout supplementation.    If you don't take charge of insulin during your workout period, you're flat-out wasting your time.   Insulin's relationship with muscle-building can be described as permissive. If you have a whey shake before working out the review above finds that to be adequately insulinogenic to permit maximal protein synthesis rates. They also noted post-workout seemed to work as well. Their hedged ""safe"" recommendation was that a protein-based meal within a couple hours before and after should surely be more than adequate.   If you already have elevated insulin levels and protein available in the GI tract, what's the benefit to peri-workout consumption of carbohydrates? Don't think this is a good ""just in case"" move either - you may experience a decrease in performance as your body works on digestion/absorption.    I've been lifting for a few years and thought I was doing okay for supplementing and timing, turns out I am not.    If you're basing that change in view on this article, I would stop worrying. You're almost certainly fine.   If you've been lifting for a few years and haven't made progress since month 6, then there's probably something you can do to improve your progress but peri-workout  di and tripeptitde aminos will not suddenly put you on the path to this.   The research review I linked at the top is a couple years old now (as is this article, nearly). Maybe some strong evidence has emerged contrary to their conclusions (I'm not an expert, I wouldn't necessarily know) but I wouldn't let this article sell you on aminos when a cheap scoop of whey or chicken sandwich will do the same thing."
AdvancedFitness,2s9slc,JSCMI,2,Tue Jan 13 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"wow thanks dude :) currently I'm having a whey shake just before, I workour at 6:00 so I don't wanna get up too early before that to eat, and a carb and protein mix after, sufficient enough?"
AdvancedFitness,2s9slc,JSCMI,6,Tue Jan 13 15:34:05 2015 UTC,"sufficient enough?   On the simple side: Are you progressing? If so, yes it's sufficient. If not, it still might be but you kinda gotta step back and take a look at everything.  As to whether it's optimal: Even if it's not, it's probably so close to optimal that you can't practically improve on it in any noticeable way.   Aragon and Schoenfeld, in their research review, drew the conclusion from the available research that you can probably drop the carb from your post-workout shake unless you have another athletic performance to recover for later in the same day. Having carbs in there isn't going to hurt anything either so leave them in if you like, but once you get as much protein as you can benefit from the presence of carbs stop mattering as far as the timing of that dose (and if you don't have as much protein as you can benefit from, carbs will only partially make up for that).   And remember we're talking about shades of optimization here. Even if you skipped one of those shakes entirely you'd probably be at least 80-90% fine. Regularly lifting heavy, getting plenty of rest, and making sure your overall nutrition is reasonably good gets you most of the way there. The only situation they seemed to think was really worth avoiding was working out fasted and not having a protein-heavy meal within a couple hours.   Which if you're eating when you're physically hungry is almost definitely going to feel unnatural anyway."

AdvancedFitness,2s9slc,JSCMI,2,Thu Feb 19 15:35:01 2015 UTC,"A lot of experts agree(d) with you on that, and it was a friendly challenge to actually cite support with clinical trials between Alan Aragon and Brad Schoenfeld which led to that research review.   As far as the research goes, support for the ""anabolic window"" is well documented IF you define it as the need for a protein-based bolus within a couple hours of a training bout (before or after). They concluded that a couple hours before AND after is probably optimal. The more common definition, of needing protein shortly after training (even if you had a pre-workout meal), does not seem to have support at any training level. An easy explanation is that nutrition from a pre-workout meal is available in the GI tract immediately after training without another meal.   Of course, what's actually optimal isn't necessarily supported by existing research. Data to clarify gray areas might not have been collected yet, or worse misleading data has been collected due to poor design etc. They looked at what existing research supported, noting in this case that is a better platform from which to direct future research than to make final conclusions.   All those caveats aside, the research certainly supports an inexperienced lifter could lessen their results with poor nutrient timing. It would almost be difficult to do in practice but for the existence of the LeanGains approach which in some cases has a trainee working out after an overnight fast and continuing their fast for hours afterward. They seemed to think the existing research shows that's a good way to get as little as possible for your effort.   Then again, Martin Berkhan is known for endorsing (but not ""requiring"") the use of BCAA's in this scenario. It's worth noting that's a variable not explored in the available literature.   All in all, MOST trainees of any experience level consuming adequate protein will probably do okay if they just eat when they're naturally hungry.

Based on the outcomes of rowing nz's week of testing - from peak power to hour and v02max he is also more power orientated in rowing. So his individualized workouts are both long ss workouts on the erg. If you have the time to invest in further developing your aerobic base for rowing then the potential is huge if you already have the predisposition to being powerful. Because rowing training is so volume based anyway it is typically very difficult for those who are naturally very aerobic to make the anaerobic/power/strength adaptations since they require so much specific work and recovery  Edit: link to blog incase: http://georgebridgewater.blogspot.co.nz/2014/12/into-grind-touch-o-speed.html?m=1

AdvancedFitness,2rwaz9,JSCMI,1 point,Sun Jan 11 16:27:56 2015 UTC,"There is a middle ground. Spend 6-12 months maintaining your current weight and body composition. Possibly reverse diet. Wean yourself off EC.  Basically just stabilize.   As far as relevant scientific concepts, Lyle McDonald's article on diet breaks (link) explored some reasons on both the psychology and physiology of a similar practice.   This is actually a very tough thing to do - to maintain weight after substantial loss - but it has to be the end point of any long-term plan. At least assuming you don't want to feel like you're ""on a diet"" forever (even if you have to eat sensibly, you should be satisfied).   Some advise to adopt a diet consistent with a goal body weight and simple eat that indefinitely, accepting that you will approach that target in a somewhat asymptotic fashion (faster loss initially which tapers off as your actual intake corresponds closer to your actual weight/metabolic usage). See this Schuler/Aragon book for a discussion (though given the success you've already had you may not find a lot of earth shattering new concepts in it)  In either case, stabilizing your current weight for a while should let your body ""catch up"" on any metabolic activity it's down-regulated, let you enjoy a break, and arguably establish a new setpoint so that if you decide in 6-12 months to lose some more weight you may be able to get your ad libidum intake closer to the 26% BF you can stabilize on now than the 40% BF you started off at.  Weaning off EC may also give your systems / heart a needed break as well as make them more effective again should you choose to pursue more fat loss and to use them again."

AdvancedFitness,2rwaz9,drioqka,1 point,Mon Jan 12 18:53:49 2015 UTC,"so terrifying to feel like you will crash and burn though after normalizing!   I know what you mean, but this feeling is probably a sign that it's time to take a break on the weight loss and set a new baseline.   If you bring your calories up quickly you'll feel more compelled to splurge so stick with those incremental increases. There's semi-bro-science that this is metabolically much healthier too (see Layne Norton's comments on this regarding professional observation of things like reverse dieting in the absence of solid clinical trials)  Also as you find your true maintenance intake you'll sometimes see pounds come back overnight so give yourself some real wiggle room on the scale. Don't let yourself react like it's fat and drop your calories back down. Expect to see weight increase as you come off a deficit. It's only water (and probably more represents reserve energy). Continue to slowly increase your daily target, let yourself eat when you're physically hungry, and if/when your physical hunger isn't compelling you to eat up to your calorie target it's a good time to scale back on EC a little more.   It can take a while but when you're weaned off EC, eating any time you're hungry, and still pretty much in the same 3ish pound range every morning then you'll take a deep breath one day and realize you've really settled into the new you. There's physiological benefit to all this but that's a psychological milestone too.   You mentioned heavy weight training and if your metabolism was in any real trouble you'd know it without a doubt when trying to do that. Lots of people (including me) have lost non-trivial amounts of body fat and had no problem at all keeping it off with pretty minimal effort (which is to say, you're not fucked in any way, you'll be fine)."

AdvancedFitness,2rwaz9,RawMuscleLab,1 point,Mon Jan 12 19:47:20 2015 UTC,"No bother at all.   The ability to build more than a modest amount of muscle get down-regulated pretty quick in a caloric deficit. If the duration and magnitude of your caloric deficit were severe, you'd be looking for answers about how to at least preserve some of your strength in your deficit rather than referencing an increase in hunger as body fat lowers and muscle mass increases. That alone suggests you're in pretty reasonable ranges of fitness and body composition (meant in a good way).   Your TDEE might be a little lower than you'd expect (at least without EC) but that's what the stabilizing (and perhaps reverse dieting) is for. You won't be in any real trouble."

AdvancedFitness,2ruu4z,Nu5ZCa,3,Tue Jan 13 23:27:32 2015 UTC,"From the discussion:   Alternatively, gluten might induce symptoms only in the presence of a moderate content of FODMAPs. Many gluten-containing cereals are high in fructans, which are a problem in patients with IBS and their concomitant reduction with the introduction of the gluten-free diet (GFD) might lead to improved gut symptoms, wrongly perceived to be due to a reduction in gluten intake. Gluten is hypothesized to have direct effects on the brain leading to depression and other neurological maladies. Although fatigue did not change in the current study with exposure to gluten, it was a prominent effect in the initial study. More focused attention to anxiety and depression rather than fatigue might provide additional clues to why patients who follow a GFD feel better. One mechanism by which this interaction might work is that FODMAPs are predominant triggers of gut symptoms and gluten is the predominant trigger for a loss of wellness. This intriguing potential interaction deserves additional investigation.   It seems like these people have irritable bowel syndrome that is relieved to some degree by eating a gluten-free diet, and it's not clear exactly why that works but it's probably not the gluten in isolation (although it might still be gluten in conjunction with other factors, or just other factors). It's still a fact that the availability of gluten-free products, for whatever reason, relieves gastrointestinal stress for certain individuals and gives them a better quality of life."
AdvancedFitness,2ruu4z,grae313,1 point,Fri Jan 9 18:17:44 2015 UTC,"It works because wheat, the source of gluten, also contains fructans, which is part of the FODMAPs. For someone like me who suffers from fructose malabsorption eliminating wheat helped a lot with my symptoms. It wasn't until I did a proper elimination diet that I realized that it was not gluten causing the issue and I needed also to cut back or cut out garlic, artichoke, onion, etc."

When I eat gluten-free pizza, I feel fine, and my body feels fine the following day.  When I eat bread, I feel okay, then I get headaches and insomnia, and then my body completely falls apart the next day and I find myself curled up on the couch rambling incoherently and begging for someone to put a bullet through my head.  So I think we need to be careful about convincing people who find relief from going wheat-free that they're really suffering from FODMAPs.  We could be causing them unnecessary harm.  The person you responded to quoted from the discussion:   gluten might induce symptoms only in the presence of a moderate content of FODMAPs   And I believe this may be closer to the truth.  But we need to recognize that the body's immune system may eventually begin to reject gluten completely if symptoms go untreated for too long.

Was to whether ""gluten might induce symptoms only in the presence of a moderate content of FODMAPs"", that's a pretty hard assumption to test as there is no dietary source of gluten that does not have FODMAPs. I won't rule out that some people may have early stage celiac, but all evidence right now points to the fact that basically everyone with ""gluten sensitivity"" has no actual sensitivity to gluten.  Remember that people who suffer from FODMAP sensitivity are going to find relief going wheat free because wheat is a source of fructans. The point is that telling them they are gluten sensitive is a lie which paints an incomplete picture of their sensitivities. For example, wheat gives me problems but if I only eliminated wheat I'd still be eating onion, artichoke, garlic, etc, which cause the same problems (if not worse). I would never have solved my problems if I hadn't been turned on to FODMAPs."

She has a few other food allergies that we thought was stuff associated with latex like bananas, avocados, tomatoes, strawberries, peppers, etc., but after seeing this FODMAP thing I figured maybe it all actually stemmed from that single issue. I know she can eat peas without problem, but I can't remember if she's eaten many of the rest of the high FODMAP foods on your list in awhile. This is definitely something to experiment with, thanks man."
AdvancedFitness,2ruu4z,Strikerrjones,2,Fri Jan 9 22:35:33 2015 UTC,"As phrak mentioned further up, I stumbled on this about 2-3 years ago when I was having some serious GI issues.  All the Celiac issues hadn't become the in thing yet and my doctors had me removing the standard foods that cause GI issues like red meat, dairy, etc.   I decided to quit messing around and do the reverse.  I went with chicken as my building block then added foods to that and kept track of how much distress I was in.  Breads in what would be a single serving size like say a chicken sandwich would set me off but I could do something like have a cookie and be fine.  It was confusing because it wasn't that eating any gluten would make me sick it was if I ate more than a little. So I kept adjusting and finding foods that I would wreck my bowels. One day I was looking for diet plans to make sure I was getting enough nutrients with all this experimenting and I ran across an article on the FODMAP diet and a light bulb went off.  The awesome thing is that after about a year of keeping the foods that are high in FODMAPs under control I can have a cheat day where I have a slice or two of pizza and don't feel like I'm dying.  I think the second part of the FODMAP puzzle is the gut flora adjusting to the diet and being better able to cope with the occasional binge."

I went most of my life trying to figure this out so for me it was magic but I'm not a doctor so I'm not making anyone any promises.  Just a quick example though to explain just how big a change there was.  My family is big on getting together, we used to do a Friday pizza night.  Almost every night after I got home I'd be in the bathroom wishing I would die.  Everyone had suggestions ""oh it's the sauce"" ""oh I can't eat pepperoni, it's probably that"" ""maybe you're lactose intolerant"".

I have to interpret these all the time for healthy people and for those with congestive heart failure in my clinical trials. He appears to weigh about 90kgs (VO2 in liter/min divided by weight adjusted VO2/kg).   Frankly I think he did the test on some bum equipment or the calibration was bad. His respiratory exchange ratio (VCO2/VO2) is pretty low before the start of exercise (below the physiological range of 0.7 to ~1.2-1.3 during exercise.. you can get higher values during recovery but lets stick to exercise). You can get low RERs at the start if you hyperventilate prior to exercise (or in recovery after very intense exercise since the kidneys retain CO2 and resynthesize bicarbonate using the carbonic anhydrase system). But the fact that his tidal volume is up as is his respiratory rate suggests to me that if anything we should have seen a high RER since he would be blowing off a lot of CO2. Bum sensor or sensors..   Although his ""VO2peak"" of 6.65 L/min is impressive I'm not sure if it's real given that either the O2 or CO2 sensor (or both) on the device are out of whack. Incidentally, just from the output I can tell you that the test was done on a Parvomedics metabolic cart and their CO2 sensor has a short life (~1year).   TLDR: don't make too much of this.. probably a bum test on poorly calibrated equipment."
AdvancedFitness,2rw6t6,siddster,0,Sat Jan 10 06:42:51 2015 UTC,His respiratory exchange ratio (VCO2/VO2) is pretty low before the start of exercise (below the physiological range of 0.7 to ~1.2-1.3 during exercise   ?  0.66 is hardly unnatural or even that unusual.
AdvancedFitness,2rw6t6,bicepsblastingstud,3,Mon Jan 12 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"0.66, 0.54, 0.56, 0.59, 0.62 etc etc.. just follow the column down.. He didn't have a consistently physiologically plausible RER till the 7th minute. 0.66 is plausible if a person has been hyperventilating and in a minute or two afterwards. Not for almost 7 minutes. Even his RER at max was <1 which means one of two things - either it's a bad test because they terminated prematurely (unlikely because heart rate was at a plausible VO2max) or that either the O2 or CO2 sensor is messed up.  Incidentally, the one of the ways you can have RERs < 0.7 is if there is a preexisting acid-base issue which requires CO2 retention to build up bicarbonate buffers. An RER of <0.7 can never be because of just fuel utilization. Ever wonder where the physiological range of RER (0.7-1) comes from? When you oxidize glucose in the presence of 6O2 you get 6C02. Hence, the RER for oxidizing carbohydrates is 1 (VCO2/VO2 = 6/6 = 1). When you oxidize palmitate (prototypical fatty acid) you use 23 O2 and produce ATP + 16 CO2 (16/23 = 0.7). Hence the range of 0.7 to 1. You are burning 100% fat at an RER of 0.7 and 100% carb at RER = 1.

AdvancedFitness,2rw6t6,bicepsblastingstud,5,Mon Jan 12 21:53:12 2015 UTC,"VO2 max is the maximum volume of oxygen that an athlete or individual can use. It is expressed in two ways: liters per minute (L/m), and milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/m).  At the 13:30 mark, when Rich Froning was most physically exerting himself during the VO2 max test, he was outputting 6.65 L/m, and 73.9 ml/kg/m. (His BPM also hit its peak at 179)  Both of these scores are fantastic, but by no means record-breaking. The highest recorded VO2 max is somewhere around 7.5 L/m, and around 97 ml/kg/m for men.  The average untrained male is around 3.5 L/m.  Edit: The average untrained woman has a VO2 max of 2.0 L/m, with the top female endurance athletes posting levels that are roughly 20-25% lower than the top men. I think the record for women is right around 77 ml/kg/m."
AdvancedFitness,2rw6t6,spiff87,1 point,Fri Jan 9 21:32:43 2015 UTC,"Is the liter per minute or ml per kg more representative of someone's fitness? I have heard that your vo2 max is genetic and can't be increased. True? What is the correlation between how much oxygen you're taking in and heart rate? If one athlete is taking in slightly less oxygen but a much lower heart rate, is that better?"
AdvancedFitness,2rw6t6,redclit,3,Sat Jan 10 07:01:24 2015 UTC,"Is the liter per minute or ml per kg more representative of someone's fitness?   If you're moving yourself (e.g. running), you're expending energy (and using oxygen) proportionally to your bodyweight, so the relative measurement [ml/kg/min] is somewhat representive of this sort of fitness, altough the correlation between VO2max and performance is not vey strong, especially in the higher end of the scale.  If you're doing work against external force and not your bodyweight, then absolute VO2max might better represent your working capacity.  It's somewhat analogous to relative vs. absolute strength. A small weaker guy can outperform a strong bulky in bodyweight movements (like pushups), even if the bigger guy wins when measuring absolute strength levels (like bench press).   I have heard that your vo2 max is genetic and can't be increased. True?   Somewhat true. VO2max doesn't typically increase that much (normal range of increase being 5-20 %) by training, but as said above, it doesn't fully explain differences in aerobic performance, so even with maxed out VO2max, one can still improve.   What is the correlation between how much oxygen you're taking in and heart rate?   To my understranding those have pretty strong correlation. Your rest heart rate corresponds to resting levels of oxygen use, max heart rate occurs pretty close to VO2max intensity levels and the relation is pretty linear between those two extremes.   If one athlete is taking in slightly less oxygen but a much lower heart rate, is that better?   No, absolute heart rate levels don't mean much from performance point of view."
AdvancedFitness,2rw6t6,the_dw4rf,2,Sat Jan 10 08:45:24 2015 UTC,"Redclit answered this pretty well, I want to elaborate on the genetic limitations.   vo2 max, as redclit said, is hard to increase by a large amount.  What you can drastically improve through training is your lactate threshold.  Lactate threshold is the point where you begin to accumulate lactic acid / lactate in your blood at a rate which exceeds your ability to remove it.  In other words, lactate threshold marks the point at which you hit a pace you can NOT keep up for extended periods of time.  So you have two runners (who we'll assume for simplicity have the same biomechanics, gait efficiency, etc) with different vo2 maxes.  Runner A has a vo2 max of 75 ml/kg/min, and hit his lactate threshold at 70% of that.  Runner B has a vo2 max of only 65 ml/kg/min, but has trained himself and raised his anaerobic threshold (different name for lactate threshold) to be 85% of his vo2 max.  Runner A can only keep a constant pace up to 52.5 ml/kg/min, Runner B can do it at 55.25 ml/kg/min, giving him a small advantage despite a much lower vo2 max.  Edit : There is so much more that goes into performance, though.  On paper I should be a great runner.  Really high anaerobic threshold, decently high vo2 max (71.4 ml / kg / min).  Only problem is I'm 5'7"" ~180 lbs with some stumpy fucking legs.  So all these performance parameters don't mean shit if your just not a good runner.  But put me on a versaclimber, or a grappling match and it really shows."
AdvancedFitness,2rw6t6,spiff87,1 point,Mon Jan 12 16:07:51 2015 UTC,"Your maximum heart rate generally varies by age. A relatively easy way to calculate this is (220 BPM - age), but this is not an indicator of overall fitness, and young athletes can easily exceed 220 BPM. When I was a teenager in very good shape and competitively cycling, I would routinely hit 230 BPM on my heart rate monitor (it has since declined). So, like I said, it can vary. My hematocrit (your percentage of red blood cells in your blood) was always around 50%, which is very high for males.  Generally, your resting heart rate is a good indicator of your overall fitness, but your maximum heart rate doesn't exactly correlate to your level of overall health.  Regarding VO2 max, it also varies. Some individuals respond very favorably to training, some individuals do not. The Sports Gene by David Epstein covers this in detail. The overwhelming majority of athletes can increase their VO2 max through exercise and training (roughly 90% I believe) but by how much truly depends on the individual.  The baseline VO2 max of untrained individuals can also vary quite a bit in addition to how responsive they are to training. From a personal standpoint, I have a relatively average VO2 max when untrained, but it increases rather significantly in response to repeated endurance training. I suggest reading Epstein's book if you want to go into greater depth. It's a fun read.  Edit: I personally like using L/m rather than ml/kg/m because it's simpler, but if you go and get your VO2 max tested, you'll get both scores."

AdvancedFitness,2rlpyl,appleswag96,10,Wed Jan 7 06:07:09 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: Member spotlights died because the community killed them and they're are an awful lot of work.  Revival has been discussed before and no one is opposed, but there needs to be wholesale buy in from the community on what their purpose is first.     Oh man.  Settle in for an /r/AdvancedFitness history lesson.  Member spotlights died because the community killed them, and very nearly killed the sub in the process.    AF was new and initially populated by a fairly close-knit group of users.  They had outgrown /r/Fitness and wanted a place to talk about fitness (or more accurately for the majority, lifting.  Think /r/weightroom v1.0) without all the same beginner questions day in and day out.  Now, without content any sub will die, even with a dedicated group of users.  Member spotlights were started to get the ball rolling.    They were wildly popular.  By far the most highly voted and commented on threads at the time.  For one, there were some really impressive folks getting their time to share their awesome accomplishments.  For another, they were well known redditors in the fitness community.  After a while, being a well known redditor was clearly the only reason people were getting spotlights.  That's fine and dandy, but it made some spotlighters embarrassed.  I know I thought mine was fairly uncalled for.  I'd done nothing worthy of being spotlit, I had nothing to teach anyone, it was just a light being shone on my mediocrity.  And this is 'advanced' Fitness.  I know many others felt the same. But the spotlights marched along.    So we were out of impressive people to showcase.  Eventually we even ran out of well known users.  Which leads us to the geodude incident.  Geodude had done nothing impressive, no one knew who he was, and was only 17.  I'm not saying this to pass judgment, just painting the picture.  The comments were overwhelmingly shitting on him and calling into question the validity of the Member Spotlights.  It was a total and complete shit show.  As you can read from the post above, it caused the initial coordinator to quit.  He attempted to pass the torch but no one really picked it up with any zeal.  It didn't help that herding cats was easier than getting nominees to complete the questionaire, let alone in a timely manner.  And you had to find people the people too.    This all happened during a time when people were really, really concerned about what passed for 'advanced' content.  It was terrible.  Eventually what happened is people got too scared to post here because they were afraid they'd be ridiculed for not being advanced enough, and the people that sacked up and posted got ridiculed for not being advanced enough.    It was lame.  And so the sub went quiet.    The was an attempt to revive the sub and member spotlights by revisiting some of the earlier spotlights (you'll see them as [Redux] in the search) but the damage was too great.  /r/weightroom had been created and had taken off like wild fire - rightfully so.  That took the most active users with it and AF was dead.      So the sub is back from the dead now, but it still suffers from an identity crisis.  Far too many people think this sub is just for discussing pubmed links.  Or that you can't say anything unless you've got an abstract to back it up.  We've swapped one idea of 'advanced' for another.  Hell, even the people posting questions or seeking advice are only asking for research or citations.  Which is just silly, and I try to correct that notion when I see someone state it.    I do like the idea of spotlighting users merely for the fact that they are regulars here, but that runs into the same issues as before.  1) there aren't that many regular users here and 2) what constitutes 'advanced' status?  For the first, we have plenty of posts in here, but very few people comment or participate in them.  For the second, if you can come up with a threshold that everyone can agree on, you win the internet.  Oh, and thirdly you need someone dedicated enough to organize the whole shebang.    So yeah, starting them again is possible, but it's complicated."

I, for one, like anecdotal pieces of advice from experienced lifters and fitness enthusiasts that have found out some things in their tenure and years of working out.

AdvancedFitness,2rlpyl,161803398874989,2,Sun Jan 11 00:36:28 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think the main problem with /r/advancedfitness is that it doesn't fill a niche or specific interest. The description tells you it's just a sort of ""catch-all"" for things beyond the beginner stages. However, typically if you're into a certain training modality, and you're past the beginner stages, you go to the relevant sub. People who pump iron have /r/weightroom, circus or no-equipment types have /r/bodyweightfitness, runners have /r/running, rowers have /r/rowing, and so on and so forth. So where does that leave /r/advancedfitness?  An idea I had some time ago when a similar discussion was held, was specificity sundays, where people from other subs could mingle with people on /r/advancedfitness and discuss specialized training for a certain sport. I organized those for a couple months but then stop for whatever reason. They were pretty well received. So that's one direction: cross training. It also gets the sub some exposure.    However, I don't think cross training is really much of a niche /r/advancedfitness can fill. You're better off simply posting to the relevant subreddits. The use of specificity sundays is then more to drive traffic to the sub. Same thing with member spotlights: it's a great idea and can be a real addition to your community... if you have members. If you want members, you need to have pretty well-defined theme.  Sadly a solid theme doesn't pop up immediately for me. If you want to get an image, just go through submissions and pick the ones you want to see more of, and the ones you want to see less of. That should give you a good idea."
AdvancedFitness,2rlpyl,eric_twinge,1 point,Mon Jan 12 18:37:29 2015 UTC,"The main problem is even deeper than that, I think.    The fact is, once you're past the beginner stages in any sport you know enough that you don't have to ask for much help any more.  Or you don't need to crowdsource your problems.  You know where or who to go to.  The vast majority of the content in all those niche subs you mentioned is still beginner questions and content.  Or it's the same question that was asked yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that...     Anyhow, I didn't mean to imply that I wanted more traffic or new members in here.  I'm quite content with our size and traffic level now.  I certainly wouldn't restart Member Spotlights with that as the underlying purpose."

My personal doctor doesn't speak English, and I don't mandarin - but he knows my body so well its unbelievable.  I lay down before the day on his table he goes to work on me for almost an hour.  I get treatment after the shows when I need and he just gives me a look like (having watched the show on coms) 'your legs are destroyed.'    The entire process is a melange of static stretching exercises and lighter-than-you-would-think massage.  I strongly warn away from 'deep' tissue or thai massage unless you are able to take +3 days off, because of the lactic release and 02 depravity that goes along with the muscular leaching and active 3rd party dehydration.

AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,MisterSambone,3,Tue Jan 6 16:55:54 2015 UTC,"It's true.  Many high performance athletes are just on a different level.  I think though that 90% of the time a year of hard work can level it out. A parallel plateau happens again then for virtually all athletes on the high level, the champion in the end does not rely on better genetics."
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,CirkusFreak,6,Tue Jan 6 17:06:20 2015 UTC,"I'd accept 90%.  Hell, I'll accept even higher than 90%.  But there is that 1% (or .1%, whatever) that a large amount of elite athletes are a part of and most of us mortals will never touch."
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,CirkusFreak,5,Tue Jan 6 17:23:14 2015 UTC,I can agree with that.
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,artifaxiom,12,Tue Jan 6 17:28:08 2015 UTC,"I'm also in the circus! Albeit a much smaller one, Flipside Circus is the name! I started circus at the start of the year and have done a few performances now. I also started doing bodyweight fitness about seven months ago, a few months before my fifteenth birthday!  Do you have any tips for someone aspiring to be a professional circus performer! I mainly juggle but am definitely starting to get into more aerial stuff which is awesome!  Also, where are you at with juggling?   How old where you when you started circus and how did you go about getting into cirque?  Thanks so much!"
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,artifaxiom,17,Tue Jan 6 12:44:10 2015 UTC,"Flexibility again and again and again.  I do a fair bit of casting for a couple major companies and this is always the deal breaker for potential new hires.  It is a direct and pure assessment of what a candidate is able to learn in terms of choreography within the the small window of creation for new shows.  Become a contortionist with strength who can also juggle.  In terms of pure juggling there are less than 100 artists in 'new' circus who ONLY juggle.  Become a well balanced performer who happens to have a pedigree in juggling and you are more an asset to a big creation than any juggler alive (except for Gatto :))  I comfortably juggle 7 balls onstage.  Also I do a front flip under 3 balls, extremely advanced 5 balls, and kick from 3 - 7 in my act.  My focus and love are with 3 balls/clubs.  While I am not in the conversation of current 'best of all time'  with 3 balls or 3 clubs, I am hopefully in the top 10 of either - and train hard enough to make it a realistic endeavor."
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,artifaxiom,5,Tue Jan 6 15:00:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the tips on flexibility! That was really what I needed to hear to actually motivate me to put effort into my flexibility! Thank you :)  And oh woah awesome, I qualified 7 for the first time the other day! But I mainly do 3b—6b multiplexing stuff.  Thanks again!"
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,zortnarftroz,10,Tue Jan 6 15:07:19 2015 UTC,"You're very welcome!  Train your body, not your hands.  Juggling is so much easier when your larger goals are body based.  I would almost say to disregard it, just keep an hour a day of training whilst you focus on your body and you'll be far, far better than the alternative."
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,saiph,5,Tue Jan 6 15:28:33 2015 UTC,"Also a circus performer here, and I mainly juggle.  Flexibility and endurance has been one of the best things for my juggling. I try to run for at least 40 minutes a day and stretch for an hour. I'm making serious attempts at Gattos 7 ring record (currently I'm over a minute). Lately I've been trying to gain more acrobatic and dance skills, do you have any tips for acrobatic drills for more core strength?   Also, would you be cool with sending a video of one of your acts? I'd love to see what you do if you're comfortable with that."
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,saiph,3,Tue Jan 6 22:28:39 2015 UTC,"Gatto's 7 ring record?  Good luck man, 15 minutes is truly an everest.  If you want a better core, hanging pike-ups are your go to.  If you can get to 35-40 without any swinging or cheating (keep your head down and butt behind you, pull from the abs) you'll be as strong in the middle as most professional acrobats."
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,meerikata,1 point,Wed Jan 7 04:41:39 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll try and work on that if I can find somewhere to hang from. Is there anything you think will help that I can do at home?
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,orealy,1 point,Wed Jan 7 06:39:06 2015 UTC,Get a pull-up bar.  Best investment you can make for your body.
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,orealy,2,Wed Jan 7 07:12:51 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I have a pull up bar, maybe I just need to find the right exercises. I recently made a set of parralettes to train on as well. Seems like the two together are a pretty solid combo."

AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,drdidg,4,Tue Jan 6 15:55:11 2015 UTC,"going   I just try to stretch as much as possible, whenever I have a down moment.  For big gains, you absolutely have to be at it every 7 hours.  If you dont take 12 hours off, for 2 weeks, you'll never stop.  It will truly shock you how well you improve.  Twice a day put aside the time and STAY HYDRATED."
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,drdidg,2,Tue Jan 6 16:03:42 2015 UTC,"Heh, noted. Right now I've only really been doing half an hour of stretching after workouts as a sort of reward.  I'll make a point of doing it more.    If you have links to any particular stretches I should be doing, it would be much appreciated. I've been sticking mostly to stretches learned as an ex-ballet dancer because that's what i know to do (I'm not a regular reader of this subreddit).  Mostly static stretches with some dynamic ones. Unfortunately that means I'm stuck in a rut of ""well... I guess I could sit in the splits some more?"" Inspiration and ideas would be great."
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,Mysta,4,Tue Jan 6 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this. A few questions:   I realize you have 5 workout days consecutively followed by rest days. Have you experimented with rest days splitting the workout days? Has there been a difference in recovery? You mention long workouts. Do you split them up in to A.M and P.M workouts? Or something in that order? What sort of medications (OTC or prescription) do you take to enhance recovery? NSAIDS, muscle relaxants etc?"
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,Alby0410,8,Tue Jan 6 11:57:57 2015 UTC,"I think the best schedule is 9 on, 2 off, and also 10 on 2 off (continue cardio and stretching).  Unfortunately because I am performing I cannot make that timeframe - and so I am at 5 per week.  For me, the thing about splits is that you have to be willing (and have the time) to go incredibly hard for the 2 days before a split.    I don't split my workouts to AM/PM because if my performance schedule, unfortunately.  I do my workouts ASAP after performance so that my lead up is the stage.  In the mornings I do abs, stretch, meditate, coffee, and then up to 45 minutes of theraband (skill set specific) of shoulders and legs.    I take alieve 1-4 times per week in the mornings depending on my wakeup   pain (always hydrated and well fed!).  The show itself is a bit of a crapshoot for me because my hand to hand partner has 1 or 2 incredibly shit days a week - and it blows my mind (shoulders).  Good grief."
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,Mysta,11,Tue Jan 6 12:12:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing :). Awesome to hear from such a high-level athlete!  Some of my questions:   Most of your reps seems to be in the 3x10r area. What's the reasoning behind this? Could you elaborate on jumping rope? Do you do specific drills (such as one leg locked knee skipping)? Why is jump rope your preferred form of fun? Ankle conditioning? Compact? Fun? What is hip rotation posture? Do you mean posterior tilt? You do lots of pullups. Do you pull as high as you can (i.e. to chest, or probably even to stomach) or do you stop at chin to bar? What is an example of a vasodilator? About squats,   Front Squat, there is no reason to ever do back squats. Front will give you better alignment and be better for you back.   Better alignment for what? Better for your back how? Do you have any sources for this?  And about core,   There are 5 parts to your core that you must work.   Where does the hollow position fit in to this? Handstands, planche, and front levers all need a strong hollow position."
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,indoninja,26,Tue Jan 6 10:47:27 2015 UTC,"3x10 is a sweet spot for what I do.  I am always trying to get stronger - but if my reps were at 3-5 I would lose out on flexibility and it wouldn't accurately recreate the harder version of my acrobatic goals.  If my reps were more than 12-15 I would have a hard time getting stronger in the way of doing 'strong things' without constantly leveling down - However I do many exercises with a theraband at mindless numbers, lateral spreads or hamstring closures for 60-100 reps.  My strength and conditioning coach was the long time USA Olympic Winter S&C coach, and he really could do a better job of explaining my rep numbers so I apologize for not being more versed about my numbers on a study level.   Another reason for these levels which I believe hugely in, is for building cushion.  I want as much mass around my neck as possible simply for the protection in the event of wipeouts.  I want my traps to connect to my ears if possible.  Similarly, I train for biceps because I also perform/train as juggler.  The stronger I am - the lighter the props - the longer the workouts - the better the results.    Jumping rope is amazing.  Squeeze your abs as hard as possible and jump for 2 minutes.  Total failure for sure.  I do a few different drills and variations but only to keep me occupied.  My favorite cardio is skipping rope with an altitude mask.  I think 4 weeks of that can make anyone superhuman.    Posterior tilt.  As high as possible without changing grip. I prefer something like this to most vaso-constricting supps because it enforces a goal of performance to growth by hydrating the muscle tissues (as opposed to every workout representing a 1-time clause of maximum ability.  IMO it is much more effective in the long run. Front squats are so so so good for your upper back.  Holding the weight actively as opposed to passively is a massive benefactor for total strength.  Its possible to squat more from the back, but at the expense total body development IMO.  At the Olympic training center the only athletes doing back squats were the powerlifters.  I can't express more emphatically that virtually all athletes should be doing front squats as opposed to back. If you are stretching your hip flexors enough to keep the hollow position from affecting you in other areas, hanging pike-ups should be represent the holy grail of abs.  But!  Don't pull from the hips, keep the head down and the butt back, pull from the abs."
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,Mysta,1 point,Tue Jan 6 11:28:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your replies :).  I find the high volume of theraband exercises and kicks really interesting. Do you do these out of habit now, or because they feel good, of for general injury prevention and proprioception?  The point about pulling from the abs is a good point. I did some conditioning classes with a trapeze artist who is planning on auditioning for Cirque and she made the same point, rather firmly :)."
AdvancedFitness,2ri04j,Mysta,1 point,Wed Jan 7 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"Mostly out of habit.  They do feel good, and they are important.  Its just become a very natural way for me to pass the time whenever I have a free moment."

Also the only gym near me that has a good set of things to do it on(Front levers, planche, back levers, l-sits are things I was doing) was kind of expensive to go to.

AdvancedFitness,2riyo8,fbleagh,3,Tue Jan 6 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"I periodically assess the currently available sleep trackers. One key component that seems to be missing is information on heart rate.   It seems to me that feedback about heart rate overnight could give actionable feedback about sleep quality as well as stress levels. For instance, I understand that waking heart rate (relative to one's own baseline) is a marker for whether someone is approaching an overtrained state. It would seem to me that this would be great feedback for where someone is in the cycle of recovery and overreaching would be invaluable. Not to mention resting rate is probably one of the best metrics that can be easily tracked at home for many aspects of fitness.   When Troy noted the Basis Peak had a HRM I was hopeful that he might mention, or we might see, the ability for the user to get at some heart rate data. Then the subject wasn't mentioned in the actual video, nor did I catch any options about it in the interfaces we saw.  Does anyone know if there is a friendly way to collect heart rate data to infer stress and training status as passively as these devices are described to collect overnight movement to infer sleep quality?"
AdvancedFitness,2riyo8,JSCMI,2,Wed Jan 7 13:00:49 2015 UTC,"I've had a Peak for almost two months now, and I'm pretty happy with it. At the same time, I'm willing to put up with a lot of the issues it has. In terms of charting HR data along with sleep, both are available, but you can't really see the two at the same time from the mobile app. Here's an example:  Sleep: http://i.imgur.com/PWrY5sJ.jpg Charting: http://i.imgur.com/CnLr8ri.jpg  The web app has a much better interface for charting the data. You are able to see data from all the sensors and the chart is annotated with sleep/activity. I can pull up something if you're interested.  One thing I did want to mention is that I have not had the sleep segmenting mentioned in the OP video. To me it seems like the band came loose from the OP and therefore the sleep was treated as separate sessions. Some issues I do have with the Peak:   Sometimes the connectivity drops out, and if you run the risk of the Peak not syncing automatically for a few days if the backlog of data builds up. The general activity classification appears to have regressed compared to the old Basis B1. With the B1, it was able to track my weight lifting activity (time active) with pretty decent accuracy. Now it just doesn't track it at all. I have noticed a discrepancy between the  GSR data between versions. No exporting of data. Mobile app is pretty clunky/buggy. I do appreciate the ability to chart on mobile now though, despite being a bad experience. No notifications to the device yet, and no official plans for a silent sleep alarm. The latter seems like a no-brainer to me product-wise, but I do see the technical problems that come up (sleep analysis is done in post on their servers).   Hope that helps!"
AdvancedFitness,2riyo8,sudowork,1 point,Tue Jan 13 21:09:25 2015 UTC,Thanks! That's extremely helpful. It looks clear the Peak doesn't provide the particular details I want. I'll wait & see how the Up3 turns out and/or competitors' releases at the pace Jawbone is moving.
AdvancedFitness,2riyo8,JSCMI,1 point,Wed Jan 14 13:14:37 2015 UTC,I'm curious what other metrics/data you're looking for. I actually have a friend who worked on the bio-impedance sensor for the Up3 and might be able to ask him some questions about what features it will have.
AdvancedFitness,2riyo8,sudowork,1 point,Thu Jan 15 02:06:32 2015 UTC,"The #1 thing I want (in addition to the basics Jawbones do already) is resting heart rate, especially around the time I wake up. I want to try to to infer stress levels from that and use it to help decide training intensity. Maybe it won't work, but I'm reasonably confident it will be useful.  Then there's little insights I might get that are not going to be gen pop features. For instance, I had apnea regularly in the past. I sleep much better usually now but I believe it happens intermittently. Since pulse/BP spike with OSA, maybe the combination of movement and HR could give me more insight into the quality of my sleep than movement alone. I've used a movement-based tracker and that data alone was not practically useful. How much movement was tracked didn't reliably correlate with subjective rest assessment. I wasn't even convinced my movement was isolated from my bed partner's, a problem that the HR sensor won't have.  If I have allergies and suspect poor quality sleep (possibly OSA?) I can often improve it with a decongestant before bed. But those also seem to disrupt my sleep (maybe? tough to isolate on a night I have other reasons to expect poor sleep) and I wake up fully awake up perhaps 3 hours early (and I can't very well pop in for an impromptu sleep study on a few nights I suspect this will happen to test it the ""right"" way). If this is because a drug like pseudoephedrine can elevate pulse might a HR tracker provide some insight into if I'm waking up because of that? And if so, can HR data tell me how close am I to tolerable levels at a lower dose? Or am I waking up earlier than I'd otherwise expect because my sleep quality is high, not low? That last question might seem obvious without a tracker at all, but if I wake up refreshed and then I'm tired by 4pm, I am really only guessing at how sleep quality, sleep duration, and exhaustion as a symptom of cold/allergies all factor together.  I'm not assuming a wrist tracker can answer all those questions (much less reliably enough for Jawbone to designate a feature for it even if there were enough market for that feature), but if it can help answer some of them then it will make a big difference for me.   That's how I see myself using it - insight into how hard I can push myself when I'm on a good stretch, and insight into what part(s) of recovery I need to address on a stretch like this winter when it seems like it's one illness after another going around.  Plus some of the other stuff Jawbones etc do already."
AdvancedFitness,2riyo8,JSCMI,1 point,Thu Jan 15 13:40:26 2015 UTC,I'm curious about that as well. I think sleeping heart rate has to be the greatest indicator of sleep quality short of covering your head in sensors.
AdvancedFitness,2riyo8,bobmighty,2,Thu Jan 8 18:16:44 2015 UTC,"Withings pulse O2 does both sleep tracking, O2 sat, and heart rate.  Alas, no measures of heart rate variability and you have to specify when to take heart rate measures (is not continuous), but almost there.  For full heart rate traces, I use a zephyr bioharness--but it is kind of a pain to wear and download data."

Yet we know for a fact that reducing weight (which can be done simply by reducing caloric intake) will make all markers of cardiovascular health improve, regardless of the diet.  That doesn't prove that low carb diets (e.g. keto diets) improve heart health or function.  Even the authors of the meta-analysis go on to say ""however the effects [of a low carb diet] on long-term health are unknown.""  There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of scientific papers that show that diets consisting of large intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol (like keto diets, which encourage copious amounts of meat, eggs and diary) are detrimental to long-term cardiovascular health.  Just because a diet can make people lose weight quickly does not mean it is in any way healthy.

Given that truly novice lifters don't require quite as much time recovering between sets as experienced lifters (in my experience), doing 5x5 for a while probably makes sense, as long as your fully-rested in short enough time that your workout isn't too long, or you really want to work out for >1 hour.

AdvancedFitness,2r66ah,thelawnmower_man,1 point,Sat Jan 3 19:46:49 2015 UTC,"Without seeing what kind of workout, I'm calling bullshit that this translates well into pushing linear gains.  A beginner could walk into the gym, and do sets of 95lb bench for 10 for 6 months.  It makes sense that the 5x10 would make more progress than the 3x10.  It doesn't make any reference (again, that I see on mobile) to how much was gained, how much the increases were, etc.  It doesn't mention anything about failure occurring, or even being close.  At the very least, the strength gain for every lift could be accounted for by the fact the 5 sets had 67% more lifts to learn mechanics, leverages, and improve the lift itself.  They should be more proficient with that many more movements.  And to state that turning a 5x5 program into a 7x5 program would be better is even farther of a stretch.  I read this and think if I'm advising a novice lifter who's going to start like so many of us did, only to later realize we wasted a lot of time fucking around without a plan and just doing whatever exercises come to mind, advise them to do another set."
AdvancedFitness,2r66ah,jokerbot,1 point,Sat Jan 3 21:02:04 2015 UTC,"Nobody's saying do random things, and nobody's saying that more isn't better because of more practice to learn mechanics, that's entirely plausible. Now, instead of debating the results you're trying to understand them; progress!  Nobody is saying definitively that 7 is better either, just that it wouldn't be surprising. Right now we don't jnow but it's plausible. Is ""more lifting is better"" really that surprising when we have people squatting less than 200? I don't think recovery is so much of an issue at that stage, and this seems to back that up. I sure as hell bet 5x5 is less sustainable, but that's not the point.  I feel like you're extrapolating a lot and then debating your own inappropriate extrapolations. It shouldn't be too surprising that more work translates to more results for beginners and that's all they're saying."

AdvancedFitness,2r66ah,phrakture,3,Sat Jan 3 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"I've actually thought about this quite a bit. I think the question derives from Starting Strengths set up vs, SL/Reg parks (edit: apparently not reg parks) etc.  I think it's important to understand the context of starting strength as IMO a program that will get a beginning athlete as strong as possible as fast as possible within the context of their sport development. As such in isolation, I don't think it's optimal for a strength trainee who doesn't do other sports for a couple of reasons:    relatively low volume e.g.     3x5@225lbs vs 5x5@195   (assuming 3x5 is at 80% of 1RM and 5x5 is at 70%)  volume difference per session = ~1500lbs per session  1500/(3x5x225) = 45% volume    fitness masks fatigue so deloading is basically a taper (ala peaking in powerlifting)    this principle is fine but deloads and rebuilds benefit by either allowing more muscular recovery, or by taking advantage of the peaking effect    advanced novice is also just more peaking    adding a light day drops volume and allows for further peaking   I totally lost my train of thought. Anyway basically I think 5x5 helps build volume and overall muscle mass longer which is more beneficial for long term strength development. Also the lower percentages required by doing 5x5 vs 3x5 means that more reps will be done with good form allowing for better neural adaptations."

Looks like their p<.05 was between total weight of 5rm and 20rm. By my eyeball test, the 5rm looked statistically significantly different before training. If you compare the improvement each group made in their 5rm it doesn't look statistically significant (again eyeball test)."
AdvancedFitness,2r66ah,geg02006,1 point,Wed Jan 7 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"Yes that part does not add up for me either.  The paper starts describing the results as   ""At pre-training [before the test started] there were no significant differences among groups [1set, 3set, 5set and control] in any one of the four exercises tested [bench press, shoulder press, lateral pull down and leg press]""   And the same is reported for muscle thickness.  Yet as you say, the tables show that the starting 5RM (normalised by me to the weakest of the 4 groups for each exercise) are:    x bench shoulder lats legs    control 6% 0% 4% 0%   1set 0% 21% 0% 8%   3set 14% 31% 8% 9%   5set 39% 59% 28% 13%    So across the board the 5set group started out way stronger than the control, the 3set somewhat stronger, and the 1set perhaps stronger.  While I'm spitting tables, here's 5RM percentage changes for all groups and tested exercises (so it's change from start to end, not normalised):    x bench shoulder lats legs    control 6% 13% 3% -2%   1set 3% 22% 19% 16%   3set 7% 24% 12% 15%   5set 1% 35% 17% 13%    Based on that table pecs is all about 3set and floor exercise (push ups), shoulders needs 5set, pull any sets for lats (floor exercise unsurprisingly sucks), and the same goes for legs (perhaps they didn't have enough base strength to do single leg squats on floor, and wore them out/prioritized endurance by jogging).  Going back to the seemingly statistically relevant starting differences, another oddity is figure 3 [elbow flexor and extensor thickness]. There the groups look fairly even, with if anything the 1set and control group slightly thicker, which does not match my first table but does match the papers description of the non-difference of the groups at start. Furthermore the table shows by far the most growth for the 5set, and remember this is growth in elbow extensor and flexor of the left arm - this taken with the data that 5set only outperformed in shoulder press, which of the three arm exercises has the least help from large muscles on the torso and therefore rely more on the smaller elbow extensors... the only tentative conclusion I can guess at in these tea leaves is that greater volume more effectively trains smaller muscles, or more likely that 5set for weight training beginners is too mentally exhausting where they can't perform at 100% for the big lifts (the workouts did more exercises than the ones tested, like bicep curls, tricep extensions and some ab exercise)."
AdvancedFitness,2r66ah,aManPerson,2,Mon Jan 12 03:54:29 2015 UTC,I'd like to know what rep ranges were used and whether it was full body or a 2 or 3 day split.

However, I would wager that the difference between 3x5 and 5x5 compared to the difference between 3x10 and 5x10 would not necessarily be equivalent or proportional.   Maybe it would be bigger in the latter because sheer difference in volume (20 reps vs 10 reps).

AdvancedFitness,2r180d,mattlikespeoples,16,Fri Jan 2 02:50:21 2015 UTC,"First year med student here, let's see if renal physiology and biochem taught me anything...  To clarify, sodium is the primary extracellular ion, potassium is the primary intracellular ion. Their levels are maintained in a fairly narrow window in order to allow for basic physiological functions. The kidneys are largely responsible for body wide maintenance of their levels, while pumps and channels on cells maintain their gradients on the cellular level.  Epinephrine and insulin both help to shuttle potassium into cells (muscle cells and red blood cells, in particular) in response to a meal (in order to maintain proper extracellular potassium levels in their fairly narrow physiologically viable range.) This excess potassium is slowly released by cells and excreted by the kidneys (30-60 minutes.) So, any potassium you eat might temporarily pull some water into your muscles, but not for very long.  Potassium and creatine both have their own specific transporters for uptake into cells. The creatine transporter actually functions as a Na+/Cl-/Creatine cotransporter, utilizing the osmotic gradient of sodium to drive the transport of creatine into cells. So, if anything, eating more NaCl will be more beneficial for maximizing creatine absorption, not K+.

I shouldn't have said anything because I can't remember much from college, but I do know that sodium, when administered with creatine, increases creatine absorbtion.    I had a book with a study that measured creatine levels after 8 weeks of daily administration of: creatine, creatine/dextrose, creatine/salt, and creatine/salt/dextrose.  Creatine/salt/dextrose resulted in the highest creatine levels, followed by creatine/dextrose, then creatine/salt, then just creatine.  The amount given what based on bodyweight, e.g. 80kg man would take 9g creatine, 75g dextrose, and some amount of salt, can't remember.  I think they just did a blood draw, so I don't know how accurately that reflects intramusclar levels.  But they did real life tests in sprinting speed, bench, squat and deadlift and the results in those correlated with the creatine blood levels.  And I can't find a similar study on Google scholar, so don't take my word as truth.    Anecdotally, in college for a few months pre-workout I took 50g dextrose, 10g creatine, 500mg sea salt (sea salt was much more effective than the standard iodized table salt), and 350mg baking soda (which buffers the creatine from turning into creatinine as quickly) and put on 10 lbs, bench went from 255 to 315, squat from 275 to 325, and deaflift from 365 to 435.

AdvancedFitness,2qrcoe,wzzzyg,3,Mon Dec 29 23:31:19 2014 UTC,A trap (or hex bar) would be a great alternative for this situation. I just saw that you mentioned you dont have access to one though. One thing you can do if its a big enough issue is  seeing a orthopedic physical therapist to improve your range of motion into pronation. Some manual mobilizations at your proximal radio ulnar joint should help with this. (I Don't recommend trying to mobilize the joint yourself though.)

AdvancedFitness,2qrcoe,geg02006,2,Wed Jan 7 00:44:19 2015 UTC,"jeep_thangs covered most of what I was going to suggest. Another option, and it's a little risky, but one thing you could do is deadlift with a double underhand grip. This will force you to externally rotate both shoulders, which will not only address your issue, but also help you maintain thoracic extension throughout the lift.   The reason no one does this is because if you accidentally flex your bicep during the lift using heavy weight, the muscle or tendon can be injured (same can happen with mixed grip on one arm). The trick is to actively flex your triceps / extend your elbow joint throughout the lift. Since it's not really possible to accidentally flex your bicep while doing this, in theory it should eliminate that risk. Proceed with caution."
AdvancedFitness,2qrcoe,jeep_thangs,1 point,Tue Dec 30 05:36:21 2014 UTC,"Well, the problem with this is that it's just like constantly training with tight pecks. Shoulders are rolled forward, chest is and will get tighter, and your middle/lower trapezius fibers will loosen and lengthen. Try switching grips regularly and doing rotator cuff exercises, mainly external rotation and row variations. Try deadlifting with a trap bar as well and using dumbbells when you can, but you'll be fine."

So to hold on to 1 gram of glycogen you gain 4-5 grams total just because your body can't store dry glycogen.  I think this is due to osmotic pressure."
AdvancedFitness,2qpb3b,heart_of_gold1,3,Mon Dec 29 12:55:09 2014 UTC,"Not to get too pedantic but it's more likely that the potassium associated with glycogen is what causes water to be associated, not the glycogen. Also glycogen is synthesized in cells, it can't cross the membrane."

AdvancedFitness,2qpb3b,tronj,3,Sun Jan 4 06:05:29 2015 UTC,Glycogen isn't water soluble so there's no effect on osmotic pressure. It's likely related to the associated potassium as anaplerosis said.

AdvancedFitness,2qpb3b,heebythejeeby,1 point,Mon Dec 29 13:11:19 2014 UTC,"Wouldn't it be due to the electronegativity of the hydroxyl groups on each individual glucose ring in the glycogen chain? The oxygen component of the -OH would draw the negative charge away from the hydrogen (thus giving it a positive charge), which would attract the negative charge of the oxygen in the water molecule (shaped like ^ But as H-O-H).  I'm almost certain I've used the wrong jargon, which is sad because I only finished my science degree like 6 months ago and have forgotten the basics of hydrogen bonding.   EDIT (only put part of my explanation): the number of available hydrogen bonding points on a glycogen chain would allow a considerable amount of water to bond to the glycogen."
AdvancedFitness,2qpb3b,Bromed_Physiologist,1 point,Thu Jan 1 09:32:40 2015 UTC,"What you're referring to is the osmotic pressure associated with concentration equilibriums. e.g. Two compartments divided by a strictly water permeable membrane  with side one having 5 moles of particle X and side two having 10 moles of particle X. To establish a concentration equilibrium, side two would have to have double the amount of water. This gives the ""fluid retention"" by particles in solution kinda view.  However, glycogen(chains of glucose) is typically not present in your blood and is strictly stored in your liver and skeletal muscle cells. When being activated for use, the chain starts breaking off into individual glucose molecules by a phosphorylation reaction. The glucose in any solution(such as your blood) definitely contributes towards the osmotic pressure of that solution.  More importantly, under normal conditions, there should never be glucose present in your urine. This most commonly occurs with diabetes and is a sign of an extremely high blood sugar. A normal blood sugar reading is about 100mg/dL. Your kidneys have the unalterable capacity to reabsorb up to almost 4 times this concentration. If memory serves, glucose will start escaping into the urine once your blood sugar levels surpass 375mg/dL. Therefore, as a ""normal"" individual, you should never be losing water weight due to glucose escaping into the urine.  In regards to no/low-carb(also chains of sugar molecules such as glucose) dieting, your overall blood sugar could be lower than the normal 100mg/dL, resulting in your blood having less particles to exhibit that osmotic pressure, resulting in your body holding less fluid to maintain that same concentration, like as in side one in the first example about concentration equilibrium. Also note that blood likes to maintain a concentration of 0.3 osmoles/L. So this target concentration is always aimed for in establishing the concentration equilibrium.  I hope this is an adequate explanation without getting too technical!"

The men in the short rest interval group ranged in age from 62-69, the other group ranged from 65-75.  The short rest group saw more improvement in lean mass and 1RM on all exercises. But they were also the younger group.  I only need 4 minutes rest when I'm trying to kill myself with really heavy squats, so I suspect that group was resting much more than they had any need to. Since I haven't read the full study, I don't know how hard each group was working (%1RM). It sounds like they were doing exactly the same plan except for the rest intervals.

I have a friend who tore a pectoralis doing bench press a little over a year ago, but that was probably more associated with over training combined with steroid usage.   That being said, the most important part of any exercise is being in control. On dips, being in control on the downward movement is extremely important because that is your entire body weight accelerating down against your pectoralis muscles and triceps. That's a lot of force. Probably the majority of injuries come from not properly warming up and having an uncontrolled descent followed by a large amount of force trying to push back up."

AdvancedFitness,2qblwd,Fit-Kucheka,4,Wed Dec 24 23:47:37 2014 UTC,"As a snowboard coach I deal with many of the same injuries you have described and in my opinion these are rarely ""overuse"" injuries but more traumatic. While many of your exercises seem good in theory, I would not be using them so much to solve the problems you are seeing but as a warm-up or cool-down pre and post time in the water.   I have found increasing the overall mass and strength of my athletes with compound lifts has increased their resiliency to traumatic injury. I really like front squats for lower back development and toe side turning mechanics and back squats for hamstring, glute and heelside mechanics. Olympic lifts have helped in teaching athletes to organize themselves spontaneously without ""thinking"" about it; something that is extremely important in an board sport.   If you are seeing a lot of valgus collapse of the back knee, the squatting helps to teach the athletes what a strong hip position is. Using this protocol with my athletes, they have found that a more stable rear hip position has allowed them additional board performance and control. It also gives the athlete somewhere to go when things get sloppy, where as if the knee has already come in it is very hard to begin moving weight forward to back."
AdvancedFitness,2qblwd,nednerbf,2,Thu Dec 25 15:29:50 2014 UTC,"Thank you for your response.  I agree that surfing and snowboarding are very similar from a strength and conditioning perspective, but they are quite different from an injury perspective.  Snowboarders suffer from much greater impacts and surfers spent extended periods of time in injurious positions - the hyperextended prone position and the surfing stance.  The majority of injuries from surfing arise from time spent in these positions rather than any trauma and as such are considered chronic injuries.  Often a minor chronic injury can result in a more obvious acute injury upon experiencing trauma, but there is little that can be done for surfing acute injuries other than caution in the water and strengthening the sites of common acute injuries.  This is why I have chosen to focus on correcting common imbalances and weaknesses.  From the introduction, it is indicated that the program is primarily intended as a warm-up.  The small rep ranges and times for the warm-up are insufficient for really effective problem solving, which is why it can be scaled up to a full 30+ minute standalone corrective exercise routine.  Surfing is a much more tradition-based than science-based sport, and as such most surfer do not even do any warm-up or corrective exercise.  This is a short program designed to increased compliance for this specific population so that we can progress to better fulfilling sports science principles.  I believe snowboarding is a more advanced in this respect due to there being Olympics events.  Definitely increasing mass and strength will decrease acute injury from impact, which I can see would be very effective for snowboarders.  I would love to get surfers into the weight room more, but as surfing is just beginning to accept sports science, it is difficult to convince them to do anything other than cardio.  I'm not sure why you say front squats for lower back development, as that is most typically seen as a quad-developing exercise, for improving thoracic extension, and for progression to Olympics lifts.  For lower back development, I would put athletes on conventional deadlift/good mornings/etc.  I agree that Olympic lifting is an extremely valuable tool for developing speed, power, and self-organization if the athletes have adequate form, but I do not find it effective for sub-elite athletes who do not have the time and effort to approach it correctly.  For example, the purpose of the CNJ is the develop maximal power in a single lift, but most amateur lifters will actually produce more power in a hang clean because of low skill coming off the ground.  Many surfers also have asymmetrical knee valgus, making loading an athlete with poor technique in a movement that encourages knee valgus for positioning to be a good recipe for injury.  It is also common for surfers to have recurrent shoulder instability, further complicating olympic lift use.  I find that accessory olympic lifts, such as the clean and pull, are more appropriate for most surfers, although they respond much more favorably to plyometrics are it feels more ""natural"" to them and they can perform much more surfing-specific movements, which they find more enjoyable and have better compliance with. For expert surfer who perform corrective exercise and have technical proficiency in the lifts, 100% they should definitely do olympic lifting.    The only issue then becomes what I call ""cerebellar fatigue.""  I haven't seen any research on it, but basically when someone is surfing 6 to 9+ hours every day, they develop a long-term decreased capacity for coordinated movement.  They pretty much hit a foot/arm/elbow/etc against something every five minutes.  I expect this may not be seen in snowboarding because surfing has a much less stable surface.  I imagine that a good volume of olympic lifting would aggravate this ""cerebellar fatigue,"" but as I said, I've never seen any research on it, so I really don't know how it works.  I agree that squatting is best for correcting knee valgus, especially with a medially-directed force, such as a resistance band wrapped around the knees, but this is difficult to do on a beach without equipment and to do correctly without any feedback.  Perhaps I could modify the leg movements so that the surfer is directed to place a hand on the outside of their knee and apply a force medially.  What do you think of this?  From what I can tell, surfing stance is a bit different from snowboarding stance in that back knee valgus is essential for performance.  It is not possible for surfers to adopt a more stable rear hip position because it compromises performance rather than enhances it.  They can become more stable in the knee valgus position, but they must be in a knee valgus position for performance.  As surfing is on a non-fixed surface, surfers shift their weight to change the position of the board in the water to begin moving weight forward to back so the knee valgus position is not as much of an issue as it would be for a snowboarder in a similar situation. They can also shift their feet for this as their feet are not attached to the board."
AdvancedFitness,2qblwd,fictitiousphil,2,Sun Dec 28 09:57:26 2014 UTC,"You say overuse injuries in the title of this post, but it isn't mentioned in the opening of the article.  Just out of curiosity, I know you mention general body parts in the intro but what do you consider a common ""back"" injury for a surfer?"
AdvancedFitness,2qblwd,Only_Forward_,1 point,Thu Dec 25 05:01:33 2014 UTC,"Excellent question.  Thank you.  I will include a clarification in the introduction as to what is meant by ""overuse injury.""  As a general rule, imbalances, poor mobility, and poor motor control result in positioning structures within the body in ways that they are ineffective at accommodating load.  When these structures are then loaded in directions and magnitudes that they cannot accommodate, it causes microtrauma.  Microtrauma may be intracellular damage, cell membrane damage, intercellular adhesion damage, damage to the extracellular components, etc.  This is typically associated with inflammation, including pain, and as such any pain experienced from such conditions is considered a chronic injury.  I'm sure you've met plenty of people with ""chronic low back pain.""  This is typically due to microtrauma to the structures in the low back, often due to loading a non-neutral spine (such as deadlifting with a bent back / lordosis due to abdominal obesity).  In surfers, the prolonged hyperextended lower back position from lying prone on the board results in an imbalance in these structures and inappropriate loading.  From the Furness, 2014 surfing injury epidemiology study that I cite heavy, chronic injury is defined as ""persistent or episodic pain lasting more than three months.""  I use the term overuse rather than chronic because I believe that is more accessible to most surfers who do not have a health science background."

AdvancedFitness,2q794t,JSCMI,2,Wed Dec 24 02:30:02 2014 UTC,"Weight training was self-reported and apparently not very well-defined in the questionnaire. From the paper:   In 1996 and 2008, participants were asked to report the average time spent per week in the previous year in each of walking, jogging (slower than 10 min/mile), running (10 min/mile or faster), bicycling, lap swimming, tennis, squash/racquetball, calisthenics, rowing, stair/ski machine, weightlifting/weight machine [emphasis added], heavy outdoor work (e.g., digging, chopping), and TV watching.    Then, for their data analyses, the researchers operationalized different categories of weight training intensity based on self-reported duration/frequency:  in one model, there were 4 groups (0, >0-10, >10-25, >25 min/day), and in a second model there were 3 groups (none, >0-25; >25 min/day).   One of their main conclusions was:    as compared with those who did not engage in any weight training activity, men who engaged in ≥25 min/day of weight training had a smaller WC and a lower body mass index (BMI), spent fewer hours watching TV, consumed less trans-fat, more fiber, engaged in more MVAA, had a higher glycemic load diet, had a better diet quality as reflected by the higher alternative healthy eating index, and smoked more."

AdvancedFitness,2pr1m1,lfaire,5,Fri Dec 19 13:42:45 2014 UTC,Depends on the amount of activity obviously... if someone ran 3 miles and ate a McDonald's double cheeseburger they took in 330 calories and burned 450 calories(for a 200lb person) so they would essentially have wasted 2 of their miles running but would still see a net loss.  Interestingly enough if that same person WALKED those 3 miles they would have burned 315 calories and therefore actually gained 15 calories of food or .4% of a pound.

AdvancedFitness,2pc59j,middleweight,13,Mon Dec 15 06:30:11 2014 UTC,"With your arms adducted, there's no acute vulnerability risk.  No structures are in a compromised position that would make it more likely than forward-hands.  Typically external rotation is considered a more vulnerable position because when the arm is externally rotated and abducted, the only anterior restraint is the inferior glenohumeral ligament, leading to increased risk for dislocation/subluxation.  Regarding potential for chronic injury risk, I do not believe that externally rotated will pose a greater risk for impingement of the supraspinatus tendon between the humeral head and acromion or for degradation of the glenoid/labrum.  I don't believe external rotation will significantly affect the positioning and conformation of the supraspinatus or the the amount of subacromial space, so it shouldn't increase the risk of impingement.  The biggest factor for your risk of injury from scapular depressions in an L-sit would be how controlled your eccentric lowering phase is.  If you just drop down, the head of the humerus can impinge the supraspinatus tendon.  Therefore you should have a slow controlled lower phase.  More eccentric action will result in more DOMS, but also more muscle development.  Alternatively, you could just do isometric contractions, which may be more applicable for activation and posture, but could also lead to muscle shortening - which might not be a bad thing, depending on your current posture.  If you are trying to correct shoulder posture, probably (depending on your individual constraints - this is generalized for the average chair-sitter) the best thing you can do is stretch your pec minor with trigger point release (https://www.truegenerations.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Pectoralis-Minor-Stretch.png) and work on thoracic extension.  It's great you're working on scapular depression - just make sure you're activating it during actual movements rather than only working on it in isolation."

AdvancedFitness,2pc59j,Fit-Kucheka,2,Mon Dec 15 21:38:13 2014 UTC,"First off, thanks for the detailed response. You didn't have to go put that much effort in, but you did, thanks again, I appreciate it. I'd be doing static holds, so the eccentric phase would happen once at the end of the timed period. Out of interest, why would speed of the eccentric phase potentially cause the humerus to impinge the supraspinatus?  I hammer pec minor and thoracic extension daily, great recommendations. My thinking behind externally rotating my shoulders was really that I try to put my shoulder in at least neutral when doing most exercises as to get a few more ticks in the better posture column. I came to the conclusion, why wouldnt I put my shoulders in external rotation"
AdvancedFitness,2pc59j,Fit-Kucheka,2,Mon Dec 15 13:39:14 2014 UTC,"No worries, it just kind of falls out of my head so it's easier for me to rattle off a response like than then something more succinct.    I didn't mean the speed itself - sorry.  It's just how controlled the movement is.  If you just ""drop,"" you can imagine how the humerus and acromion can bash into each other.  It's just typical that faster movements are less controlled and slow movements are more controlled.  Neutral grip is definitely typically the best for shoulder health.  I know for bench press and pullups, injury risk is pronated>supinated>neutral (dumbbells for neutral BP of course).  Of course, supination/pronation isn't really relevant for an L-sit, but supination tends to be more externally rotated so I would expect that could be less injurious.  As for neutral vs externally rotated for L-sit, I have no idea.  I just tried it myself, but I'm too weak in that position to really tell a difference.  The greatest difference I noticed was more stretch on the wrist flexors, which could be good or bad depending on how much hand balancing you do (too much too soon leads to injury, but some will help with wrist mobility).  I reckon try an L-sit with neutral and then with ER and see if you notice a difference for your thoracic and shoulder posture.   As a side note while we're talking about hand positions, there's also a ""scapular position,"" which is where you shoulder is in the best position to produce force.  You can find this by holding a barbell with one hand on one shoulder and relaxing.  The barbell will rotate to a position typically between 45 degrees and neutral, which shows you what your scapula's natural position is.  This is the hand position I would train most athletes in when they're doing strength/power/hypertrophy."

However, if you're finding that when you lower your body, your shoulders also shrug up to your ears, then you can be impinging the supraspinatus tendon and setting yourself up for bony spurs later in life, etc.  In general though, dips place your shoulders in a pretty stressful position and I never recommend them to most athletes.  If you have any shoulder concerns, you're better off just doing dumbbell bench press (elbows in, hands neutral to 45 degrees) and working on your rotator cuff.  If you're doing body weight work, then yeah, you're kind of limited in your exercises and would probably have to have some sort of dips in your progressions."
AdvancedFitness,2pc59j,kayetech,1 point,Thu Dec 18 23:42:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I do keep my scapula down, but maybe not as I might have impinged my shoulder doing dips (have an appointment on monday to get it checked out). Unfortunately, I am doing a pseudo bodyweight routine (including weighted movements). Handstand pushup progressions seems like a decent alternative, but it lacks the chest and triceps focus of dips."
AdvancedFitness,2pc59j,blue_water_rip,3,Fri Dec 19 00:09:21 2014 UTC,"Yes, the shoulder position for dips is very stressful.  Two other things to watch out for are overextending at the bottom (which is obvious if your shoulders or body are rolling forward at the bottom) and if you perform them at an explosive tempo, there can be that little jerk at the top of the movement, which causes your body weight to hit back down on your humerus (acromion of scapula hits head of humerus to impinge the supraspinatus tendon, rather than the typical humerus hitting acromion)  Overhead movements (like handstand) are typically the most stressful for the shoulder joint, and I would say definitely stick to horizontal push and pull until your shoulder is feeling 100%.  Having said that, I personally find handstand pushups much less shoulder-stressful than barbell overhead press.  Maybe a bit more stressful than dumbbell overhead press though.  I also personally find dips more shoulder-stressful than handstands, but everyone's shoulder and biomechanics are a bit different so do whichever variation works best for you.  Different variations of handstand pushup having varying stresses as well.  I believe straight are less stressful than arched and toes against the wall are less stressful than heels against the wall, but I haven't looked into that as much."
AdvancedFitness,2pby1k,dan-the-man-,5,Mon Dec 15 05:07:12 2014 UTC,"Resting heart rate is highly correlated with aerobic power (heart strength and ability for the body to process oxygen).  It sounds like you were very highly stressed from high volume of exercise and your body wasn't getting as much recovery as you need.  Depending on where you are in the season this could be a problem (if you're close to competition) or simply an aggressive training period (offseason, or a ways out from a big competition).  Reaching a point of being slightly over trained isn't necessarily a bad thing so long as you are able to recognize it and deload a bit to recoup and reap the benefits."
AdvancedFitness,2pby1k,Treebeard560,1 point,Mon Dec 15 05:20:45 2014 UTC,My Competition season will start at the end of December and span through early spring.  There will be a total of 4 races that i need to qualify in spread out thought about 1 month and a half's worth of weekend.  Because a majority of my training up to this point has been muscle building based should i focus on building aerobic tenacity in the weeks leading up to competition months?
AdvancedFitness,2pby1k,SlayerSBoxxy,2,Mon Dec 15 05:44:25 2014 UTC,"Yes, because muscle builds and degrades much slower than cardio."
AdvancedFitness,2pby1k,Treebeard560,2,Mon Dec 15 06:29:21 2014 UTC,"Cardiovascular capabilities and maximal strength degrade slower than strength-endurance and speed capabilities.  The residual training effects of Aerobic and Strength training last for approximately 30 days before significant dropoff, whereas speed training residuals might only last for 5 days.  The takeaway from this is that the closer you get to competition the more you can focus on doing what you need to do and executing it with speed.  The closer you get to a meet the less strength and long distance (longer and slower than competition) work you should do with more emphasis on shorter distances than your competition distance at faster speeds than competition pace."

AdvancedFitness,2pby1k,boojieboy,1 point,Mon Dec 15 16:34:10 2014 UTC,I've done work using HRV for several years now. I have no idea who Joel Jameson or what the bioforce system is though.
AdvancedFitness,2pby1k,cstmx,0,Mon Dec 15 16:37:46 2014 UTC,I assume you are of the opinion that it is worthwhile then? Can you expand on your method? or point me to some info on the subject? Is it applicable for a DIYer?  Joel Jameson is just a guy bringing it to market in an easy-to-use format.
AdvancedFitness,2pby1k,boojieboy,3,Mon Dec 15 17:08:07 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand your question. HRV is merely a measure of heart activity; interpreting it in a useful way is another thing entirely. Some uses of HRV are valid, others not so much. In my own work, we use it as a psychophysiological measure, as an indicator that can help us understand the physiological expression of psychological stress.  As with any measure, there are better and worse ways to obtain it. Pretty much the gold standard is with ECG/EKG, with leads set up across the thorax in some fashion, so as to produce a nice sharp r-wave peak.  Sampling rate needs to be at least 1khz, any slower than that produces some error into estimation the fiducial point and thus error into estimates of IBI (interbeat interval, which is the basis for getting HRV). On top of that, to do it really well you need to record the respiration signal (breathing in/out) so that you can estimate RSA. This requires another sensor on top fo the one you use to get the cardiogram. A pressure cuff on the chest can be good, but thoracic impedance is replacing that.  If Mr. Jameson is recommending anything other than this sort of method, then I'd be suspicious of how accurate an estimate of HRV one could get it. I've seen people use pulse plethysmography (the little light sensors you put on your fingertip). It's not nearly good enough. As for the electrical sensors on a typical wrist-mounted device, I really have no idea how good they will be at recovering the r-wave peak. My suspicion is they tend to have fairly low (under 200 Hz) sampling rates, which really places limits on their accuracy/sensitivity.  Lastly, the algorithm that you use to recover the variability signal is important. In the lab the standard is to run it through an FFT and subtract out a separately recorded respiration signal to eliminate RSA from the estimate, and what's left over is HRV, with it's two frequency bands, one to tell you about parasympathetic level, and the other (supposedly) to tell you about sympathetic level, and their ratio sometimes discussed as ""sym/parasym balance"" but this is still not universally accepted as a valid measure of much at all.   Here are the two standard methodological references we use:  Berntson et al (1997) PDF  EHJ 1996 PDF  As for whether it's useful for a DIYer? I'd have to say NO, mostly because in my experience doing it well requires extensive training and experiences, but more because interpreting HRV is never as easy as people who are selling it for public consumption want to portray it. There's a huge literature that's rapidly growing, and using it effectively really requires a large background knowledge that you're not going to get unless you've spent countless hours reading about it, listening to speakers at conferences and the like.  But I'm sure that won't stop most of you from trying it out anyway."
AdvancedFitness,2pby1k,SlayerSBoxxy,0,Mon Dec 15 17:34:06 2014 UTC,Thanks for the detailed response.  As to the DIY question.. would things like the 1khz sample rate be necessary if the goal isn't psychophisiological stress measurement? Could a less detailed sample set tell the person enough to decide whether they are simply approaching overtraining or not?   To my knowledge the bioforce setup simply uses a Polar heart rate transmitter to send a signal to a bluetooth or plug-in dongle for smart phones.. obviously a very far cry from a 12-lead + respiration signal.  I do think a part of the process is tracking waking pulse rate every day.. but I thought the point was to identify overtraining before you get to that level.   Thanks for any opinion.

But basically the notion is that rest and ice is bad because it slows down the flow of blood to the area. Even though it may slow down the swelling, it's ultimately inhibiting the recovery of the injury. So instead of constantly resting and icing your injury, MCE suggests that cautious mobilization of the injury may be a smarter alternative when you're body is able to handle it in order to increase blood/oxygen flow to help the recovery process. /advancedfitness, please stop me if I'm pedaling pseudoscience hahha"

Now I don't have sources so this is just speculation on my part but I would assume that forcibly slowing down your breath in periods of recovery would inhibit performance. You will not be able to remove lactic acid and other waste products as quickly nor re-synthesize ATP as fast. Most people slow down or control their breathing in order to pace themselves. It's a habit from when I used to run a lot that I'm actually trying to break when I'm lifting.

I have used TENS and EMS units for over 10 years, and found them generally useless for fitness (as opposed to health).   3 major points with EMS/TENS as it applies to sports fitness.   TENS type units (which this appears to be) are low-power units for sending light messages to your muscles. This is used for back pain mostly, and is quite effective for some types of pain and soreness. I use these for ""recovery"" as i just want to feel less sore after I hit a new muscle. EMS are the heavy-hitters (although most off-the-shelf units are not powerful enough to really qualify in my mind, i'd put them with TENS). They are wall-powered, and can contract your muscles harder than you can. This is the midevil shit they used for the early russian studies showing efficacy. Activation at this level HURTS, amazingly.  Newer hybrid, digitally controlled units (like this) are the future. They can pack a bit more juice in a battery operated module, and more nuanced control. The results are marginally better than the old ones. Many work based on newer theories of micro-pulses that are supposed to help your muscles recover/purge toxins/etc. The science is still sketchy at best.

AdvancedFitness,2ot5ag,ErnestRutherford,3,Tue Dec 9 23:56:56 2014 UTC,"Think of genetics as the key and sports as the lock. You need the right key (genetics) but you also need the right lock (sport/activity) to open a door.  Anyone can improve significantly without the key, but if we take weightlifting as an example, the improvement would be to go from ""utter crap"" to ""not a loser"" while a genetically gifted individual will go from ""decent"" to ""world champion"" by putting in the same work.  There is more that goes into this. One argument might be that the ""losers"" aren't training 40h weeks in their sport and this is true. However, one would be a fool to invest that much time into a sport where they are still unlikely to succeed.   Genetically gifted individuals usually start their careers by beating out lesser talents without that much training, simply because they don't need that much training to get the job done. Look into the early career of Bolt for example. He's not putting in countless hours of hard work as a teen, but he certainly did to run a world record.  Using grip strength as an example, I could only find normative data for the elderly without an exhaustive search but it serves as an example. In the age category 70-70,9 the left hand grip strength 95% range was 31kg–59kg. This is a close to 2x difference between the low-end of the range and the higher end of the range. Note that this excludes the 2,5% of people who are the genetic elite.  The subjects in that study needed to be at least able to walk without a walking aid. While not really a high standard, it hopefully excludes the weakest of the weak but includes all the normal and strong people and so is relevant.  Now, imagine the high-end and low-end both go training an equal amount and increase their performance by 30% and you will find the true effect of genetics.  The genetically gifted never attribute their success to good genetics, and coaches never say that their athletes dominate due to great genetics. This is in part because it invalidates their hard work and in another part because they compete against equally gifted athletes.  When you compare ordinary people to the genetic elite, it becomes apparent how big a role this plays.  It is absolutely certain that most people can not develop a high degree of athleticism. We never see it manifested in the majority of people because they do not respond strongly enough to training to be motivated to continue. The genetic elite don't usually start out their careers with meticulously planned programs tailored for them by expert coaches.    Any studies that elaborate on just how big a factor genetics are when it comes to type IIb fibers would be appreciated.   Those studies probably don't exist yet. If they do, you probably need to read them in mandarin. Current studies provide clues but no conclusive findings as to how big a role genetics play.  Here is an example of one study though where they genetically modify a mouse, making it gifted for certain activities. Look especially at this table bottom right where the genetic advantage is clear. The gifted mice ran 2x as long but only slightly lower max speed.   Genetics play a major role."

If they're genetically modifying the mice, then that's not a ""natural"" genetic advantage as I'm concerned about, but rather an artificially created advantage. I'm sure the general genetic distribution of mice strength can't match a group of mice that's been genetically altered in an artificial manner. Much like the general population of weightlifters couldn't hope to compete with someone on anabolics. You definitely have me thinking with the elderly study and I'll reply after my classes later today with my thoughts."

You are right in the sense that this particular genetic mutation is not naturally occuring in the study. However, they are examining a natural variant and not some terrifying mutant. Similar to how the myostatin knockout gene is naturally occuring. It shows the power of genetic variants and how dramatic the differences can be, even with just a single gene changed.  Anabolics are likely to have less an effect on a genetically normal person than the genetic advantage.

AdvancedFitness,2op5y0,jimmifli,27,Tue Dec 9 03:51:52 2014 UTC,"Sapolsky's book Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers is a great primer on stress and how to manage it.    His general thoughts are layed out here:   “Everything in physiology follows the rule that too much can be as bad as too little. There are optimal points of allostatic balance. For example, while a moderate amount of exercise generally increases bone mass, thirty-year-old athletes who run 40 to 50 miles a week can wind up with decalcified bones, decreased bone mass, increased risk of stress fractures and scoliosis (sideways curvature of the spine)—their skeletons look like those of seventy-year-olds. To put exercise in perspective, imagine this: sit with a group of hunter-gatherers from the African grasslands and explain to them that in our world we have so much food and so much free time that some of us run 26 miles in a day, simply for the sheer pleasure of it. They are likely to say, “Are you crazy? That’s stressful.” Throughout hominid history, if you’re running 26 miles in a day, you’re either very intent on eating someone or someone’s very intent on eating you.”  ― Robert M.

For example, cortisol levels increase in generally excited situations too: seeing someone you are in love with, going to the concert of your favorite artist etc. But the stress relief effect of exercise is due to many other hormonal (dopamine) and ""meditational"" (clearing your mind, feeling good about your body, feeling that you accomplish something) factors."

AdvancedFitness,2op5y0,Ballaticianaire,1 point,Tue Dec 9 19:31:09 2014 UTC,"No, it is completely accurate. GH is quite anabolic in contractile tissues/bone & liberates FFAs but that's about it. The anabolic effect of GH is mediated via its conversion to IGF-1, which then does directly promote protein synthesis and growth.   The role of GH celeritously eliminates it as a candidate for promoting robust muscle growth. In essence, GH doesn’t affect contractile proteins in muscle tissue. At best, it could decrease levels of protein degradation slightly (though probably not with the rises seen with exercise) through a few mechanisms - may attenuate catabolism of protein & AAs, most likely resulting from much larger quantities of circulating FFAs, and can enhance AA transport through the cell membrane, increasing substrate levels for protein synthesis (modulates 3 main pathways - JAK2-STAT, PI3K-Akt, and Ras-MAPK)."

AdvancedFitness,2ohh0z,Ballaticianaire,6,Sat Dec 6 20:04:28 2014 UTC,"If you click PDF at the top of the page it takes you to the full text by the way.   Also, most of this has been corroborated from other studies, such as reduced inflammation (likely via HDAC4), shift towards lipid oxidation (PGC-1 alpha, differential PPAR-gamma regulation, etc), improved insulin sensitivity/glucose tolerance, attenuated plasma cholesterol & TAG levels, et cetera.   It seems what may underlie much of these types of benefits is due to eating by your clock, showing the relevance of chronobiology. Entrainment of your central clocks with your peripheral metabolically regulated organs is incredibly important and seems to be MUCH more pertinent for health than diet composition (though if we go that route, the gut microbiome will likely play a large role, and they have been shown to actually influence us via our circadian clocks as well). May be mediated by increases in Sirt1 and CREB during fasting which play integral and paramount roles in entraining and regulating our central clock @ the SCN.   However, with this study there was one bit that I was surprised about and found particularly captivating - the aspect on protein metabolism.  As far as protein synthesis capacity and general protein metabolism is concerned, they actually noted an increased level of circulating amino acids in the ad-libitium groups, and an increased expression of p70s6k in the fasting group (thus also decreased circulating AAs). This is pretty exciting as it seems to hint at greater protein synthesis and AA utilization when giving your body adequate time to fast, despite an elevation in some catabolic factors. The ad-libitium group also had elevated levels of gluconeogenesis, which shows the elevated circulating AAs are likely being more-so utilized there to convert into glucose, dampening available substrate for protein synthesis. I'm not sure how physiologically relevant it is, but it's still highly intriguing. It was even a tad surprising.  What's interesting is that 1-2 studies have found higher protein synthesis rates when consuming more meals with lower protein per meal vs 1-2 large boluses. However, this study hints at the fact that perhaps fasting and thus consuming larger boluses actually augments our body's ability to synthesize the proteins and utilize them for skeletal muscle, which may offset any potential protein synthesis rate difference (that's already marginal)."

From my professional dealings with them, I would compare them more closely to chiros, in that they seem to focus on only parts of the picture (hands on treatment of joints and muscles), while seemingly ignoring others (peripheral and central nervous system effects, exercises for motor learning and strengthening, etc.).

I looked through your comment history and you're a physio. Which explains the immediate distaste for Osteos and Chiros haha but maybe don't condemn the masses on the actions of a few, Osteos preech the ""wholistic"" approach, so I'm not sure where you're getting the ""parts of the picture"" view. And as for chiros, they believe the body revolves around the spine, some of them do a great job and treat just as effectively as any other profession.   Either way, I agree It's disappointing that people treating more for money than patient care is bad, and it gives the profession a bad name when they don't get results. But as I said it's the practitioner less the profession.   EDIT: Also I didnt down vote you, its your opinion :)   EDIT 2: I know this is getting a bit long but you do know taping is only a temporary fix, recent literature says you loose all effectiveness after about 10 mins due to sweat and the glue not holding as well.

Certain hormones that effect metabolism definitely take a hit during a caloric deficit proportional to the duration and intensity of the deficit and can take just as long to recover.  There's a recent case study that followed a bodybuilder during a 6 month prep and 6 months after show if you want to search around for it.  Interestingly enough the idea of reverse dieting has been around for quite a bit of time now.  I remember 7 years ago John Berardi would recommend adding 200 kcal every two weeks until you reached what his recommended macros were at that time which was quite high.  He recommended doing this process before thinking about doing a cut.  The anecdotal evidence is definitely there but I feel like people are hoping for some crazy result where they get too stay 8%bf and eat at 6000kcal.

AdvancedFitness,2od4ts,realcoachjohn,2,Fri Dec 5 14:17:19 2014 UTC,"When running, tempo runs have a very specific meaning, closely related to the intensive training at the top of the graphic. The 'extensive tempo' is just short interval/repetition training."
AdvancedFitness,2od4ts,Gymrat777,2,Fri Dec 5 19:58:53 2014 UTC,"I think you highlight a good point - nomenclature depends on the context it is being used (i.e. track vs. triathlon).  I was a little limited in terms of space for the infographic, but in the article, Derek Hansen goes into what he was taught constituted as ""tempo."""
AdvancedFitness,2od4ts,omrsafetyo,2,Fri Dec 5 21:17:08 2014 UTC,"I personally think /u/Gymrat777 is misled on his concept of a tempo run.  A tempo run is simply a run at some percentage of your max effort.  Just because marathoners, tri-athletes, etc. typically like to define these as 15-20 minutes, or up to 40 minutes, etc. does not mean that is what the term is limited to.  Tempo is just a rate or pattern of doing something. For instance, you can do temp lifting, in which the rate at which you perform each piece of a repetition is defined, e.g.:  Squat, 5x5 31x2  If I follow the above, I will be doing 5 sets of 5 squats.  I will take 3 seconds for the eccentric portion (3) , pause in the bottom for 1 second (1), explode as fast as possible to the top (X), and then rest at the top 2 seconds before moving to the next rep (2).  In marathon training, short intervals aren't typically used for tempo runs - the tempo is just the rate (e.g. 75% of 5K pace).  But that is not the de facto standard of a tempo run.  What you have outlined is more common for structuring a tempo workout.  I think /u/Gymrat777  was thinking of LSD or Long Steady Distance running."
AdvancedFitness,2od4ts,Gymrat777,1 point,Sat Dec 6 01:12:36 2014 UTC,"I take your point about tempo just meaning ""at a certain rate."" I am thinking of tempo runs as defined by Jack Daniels, which is usually about 20 minutes at almost 5k race pace (sometimes split into long intervals like 3x 7 min at tempo pace with 1 min rest). That type of pace for the short intervals described in the graphic are likely insufficient to stimulate a strong result."

I would like to point out that every one of his sources that directly looked at hypertrophy with different rest intervals had their subjects take each set to failure. I'd bet a shiny dollar that submaximal effort sets would show an improvement with shorter rest intervals (like how Jamie Lewis trains). He doesn't seem to be a fan of the metabolite accumulation thing, but I don't see how he can ignore how everything comes together to point to that. You get hypertrophy with bloodflow restriction because metabolites can't clear out. You get the same hypertrophy with different rest periods because there's a certain concentration of metabolites that interferes with muscle contraction, whether at the muscle or through the nervous system, and that concentration is the same when you go to failure regardless of rest period or load used (sort of). The metabolite concentration probably dips further during the longer rest intervals, but it doesn't really matter so long as you get those peaks that trigger hypertrophy.   I could be wrong, but I really feel like that's what the evidence points to."

AdvancedFitness,2nu708,StuWard,8,Sun Nov 30 11:43:45 2014 UTC,"Prevailing thinking about obesity and related diseases holds that quantifying calories should be a principal concern and target for intervention   That's because quantifying calories is familiar ( provides comfort ) and can be effective ( serves to map reality ) if it's done with the proper attention to portion control.    Weight loss is the product of a non-trivial caloric deficit over a significant period of time.   That's thermodynamics, and since we're not calorimeters, the quantification is certainly imprecise.    Lack of rigour and that imprecision can really mess up your head. This is true.  I don't think the author's suggestions w.r.t. enjoying satisfying fats in your diet, resolve the issues people have getting a handle on weight management.  With that said, I prefer the more accurate ""Rate of Weight Change"" model, which doesn't count calories, but provides relevant, actionable feedback on a daily basis."

It's not wrong, but casually, it's not a useful way of thinking about it if you're trying to fix the problem.   The ""Rate of Weight Change"" model is a decent way to implement a calorie-driven feedback on a tight loop, but it still doesn't use most of the suggestions in the article. The basic message is that you can eat in a low-calorie way that leads to obesity and poor health, and it's worth considering higher calorie foods to break that cycle."

As low calorie diets are not maintainable, they should really be defined as a form of anorexia.  If you get used to eating lower amounts of calories you will get used to burning lower amounts of calories as well.     Low calorie diets often lead to shrinking stomach sizes especially when you do not discriminate against fats like this article suggests you shouldn't.   With a small stomach size how are you possibly supposed to eat the 10 fruits and vegetables needed for a healthy diet, and 6 portion of fibrous starchy foods.   Sure it's true that you cannot get fat without a caloric surplus.  But is that really the cause the rates of obesity?   I would put my bet on the spikes in hormone levels caused by a low fiber diet that is high in animal derived foods, ""macro nutrient foods"" ie oil, butter, protein powder and sugar.  How is someone supposed to adapt to eating a lower calorie diet when their growth hormone spikes, insulin spikes every time they eat.   We know that without high amounts of fiber this does not happen.  THe ""solution"" to eat fatty foods is not one people can realistically live a high quality life doing.   Our muscle aesthetic culture also promotes these spikes in insulin and growth hormone as good things.  For the goal of a temporarily lean physique. Lean just long enough to take a picture of before it goes away."

The marathon training with unavoidably interfere with your recovery, and you can't really just eat your way out of the problem.  If you want to prioritize running and aesthetics, it would make since to reduce your calories to decrease your BF%.  Your strength progression will suffer, but you're already at decent strength levels and they are unlikely to decrease much, at least, if you keep training and don't overdo the caloric deficit.

You are a very active person so you must be eating a ton to be that fat, or you have a slow metabolism. Have you ever gotten your thyroid checked? PM if you have any more questions. Fat loss comes down to energy balance.    If you get leaner, you will feel so much lighter and running will be much easier. Imagine running with a twenty pound dumbbell or plate for miles. It's exhausting.   There's a reason marathon runners are so lean, they need their bodies to be efficient, extra muscle and fat is not beneficial to long distance. You need to pick strength or endurance.    In my opinion, 7 minute mile is a good goal and you can keep lifting heavy, but the marathon out of the question.

Protein distribution will help too (before anyone jumps on my case about nutrient time - it DOES apply in cases like these).

To get down to that pace, your most likely going to be running 5-6 days a week. Do you could lift 1-2 days a week, but your body really needs recovery days.

Although they seem to want to provide encouraging support to training-to-failure (by singling out the small advantage for that method in BP max gains) it seems like the larger message is that for the most part these two regimens lead to very similar outcomes overall, on just about every measure. The biggest difference, to my eyes, seemed to be that for their RF subjects, there was a big jump in IGFBP when they got started, whereas the NRF subjects experienced a steady increase over the course of their training. Not sure how much of a difference it would make in the end, but it doesn't seem like much to my (admittedly) non-expert eyes.  As a person who uses weight training in my off-season to enhance my distance running performance, the most useful thing I think for me is their conclusion that training-to-failure can have the effect of enhancing local muscular endurance.

The prehab work is essentially to prevent further injuries. You have the prehab work confused with rehab work. Rehabbing is something physical therapists do AFTER an injury. As S&C Coaches, our biggest task is to not only make our athletes as athletic as possible but also preventing injuries from happening. This is where the PREHAB work is done.

From my reading, most of the traditional BB crowd has the same opinion as McDonald on this issue, get lean, bulk to something not quite lean, rinse, repeat.  There aren't many who follow the GFH bulking strategy.  For more on the P-Ratio, most of what's easily available is from McDonald.  The UD2 book is the one that has most of it, IIRC."

Most beginners can attain some recomposition/gain some muscle without fat, without the need for a dietary surplus or deficit yet.   Then the choice is pretty simple:  cut until 10-12%, bulk until 15%"
AdvancedFitness,2n72gs,JSCMI,6,Tue Nov 25 13:21:13 2014 UTC,"I thought it was suggested to bulk first for a beginner in that situation, because it's more 'fun' to bulk, and you see yourself improving in strength faster.

AdvancedFitness,2n72gs,meerikata,6,Mon Nov 24 04:06:27 2014 UTC,"This article drives me crazy.    Since the P-ratio is more favorable to muscle gaining in leaner people   Does anyone have a source supporting the observation of this in dieted-down lean trainees? Because that article doesn't.  There's no question that ""naturally"" lean people have a better p-ratio and their weight gain is more muscular (nearly by definition). But in the absence of actual evidence I'm starting to think that recommending dieting down to 10-12% BF to make a trainee's p-ratio similarly favorable to someone who's unrestricted eating habits keep them in that range is as absurd as claiming that once someone diets down to 10-12% BF they can eat unrestricted and stay at 10-12% BF without further effort or discipline.    I have this http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/muscle-gain/initial-body-fat-and-body-composition-changes.html/[1] that says 10%-12% is ideal, and 15% is the limit to that, but I would also like to read more articles to learn more.   Lyle McDonald writes, in this very article you linked, that this is an anecdotal idea he suspects is close to correct but hasn't actually been shown in dieted down individuals.   In fact, it says the advantageous profile associated with 10-12% BF ""in no way describes individuals who have dieted down to a low body fat percentage""  This is his only support: ""it seems empirically that once body fat gets to the 15% range or so for men, fat gains tend to accelerate during mass gaining phases.""   He takes an idea, makes a science-y hypothesis for why it might be true, admits that hypothesis is almost certainly not true, but insists it's been seen in the gym even though it's never been tested.   In other words, that article is a textbook example of pure broscience."

AdvancedFitness,2n72gs,meerikata,2,Tue Nov 25 07:56:14 2014 UTC,"I've never encountered this before, but after reading it I think it's an interesting idea. First I think your view of bulking is getting fat. What bulking should be considered is optimum nutrition for gaining muscle mass. The following is just an idea. I'm not sure if this could be found by solid experimenting. For people new to lifting someone skinny fat I would say their body fat is 15.5 percent. I think the progression of strength would be relatively linear barring injury for the first year. If they were to bulk up to 20% at 80 calorie excess a day for a year. If they were instead cut down to 11% the opportunity loss for not gaining maximum strength would set them back by the end of the year more than a steady bulk. I recognize that year bulk at 80 calories a day is not optimum it's just for arguments sake. Bulking should be the least amount of calories in order to get all nutritional needs. Its much easier to overkill than it is to eat the perfect amount."
AdvancedFitness,2n72gs,demzki,2,Mon Nov 24 02:57:48 2014 UTC,"I think skinny fat new to lifting people have a body fat percentage closer to 17-18%, because they have no real preexisting lean body mass."

If that is true, the stress of a caloric deficit may significantly affect this adaption. That idea is complex, way above my level of understanding and education, and probably unanswerable at the moment.        In practical terms people drastically changing their life is hard. Getting people to workout and diet let alone workout is extremely difficult. People want to see results that meet their expectations quickly. If a skinny fat diets down they may be discouraged by the way they look. Those that gain first will be able to themselves once they cut they will look good. The difference between the strength gains is probably not that noticeable in a novice anyway. This is highly advanced, and unless competing at an advanced level you probably can pretty safely disregard it."

AdvancedFitness,2n72gs,meerikata,1 point,Mon Nov 24 04:11:13 2014 UTC,Gains in the firsts 8-12 weeks are mostly neurological. This is caused by a few adaptations:  -increased ability to use type IIx muscle fibers -increased synchronization/coordination of all motor units -decreased golgi tendon organ activation -decreased coactivation of antagonist muscle  It makes sense that primary adaptations would be neurological. It takes less energy to make these adaptations as opposed to building muscle which would take longer and be more costly.

AdvancedFitness,2n6pnd,JSCMI,2,Sun Nov 23 23:57:34 2014 UTC,"Too vague to have a meaningful answer. You have to look at the purpose, type of training / how depleting it is, and how time-dependent recovery is.   Based on both this 2010 research review as well as this 2013 research review, the role of carbs is really limited to glycogen repletion.   If a trainee is lifting weights 3-4 times a week they can maximize strength & hypertrophy response with protein (pre- or post-, anything within a couple hours either way is probably fine).   Even after a (relatively) depleting workout, glycogen will be back to normal by the next day, if not sooner. As far as insulin, the protein itself elicits an adequate response (you can spike it higher with additional carb but that won't translate into greater response to training).   In that context, you simply want protein in your GI around the time you're training. The rest of your nutrition is not very dependent on timing assuming remotely normal intake.   If multiple bouts of training or performance will happen sooner together, for instance hours apart, then carbs have a time-dependent recovery role. But that won't be a universal 2:1, 3:1, etc ratio either as the needs will vary."

Now because of further research on nutrient timing I don't follow any of that nonsense.  I get my macros in how many meals are convenient and I don't drink any peri-workout shakes.  Guess what?  My recovery and performance and gainz are exactly the same.  If you are an athlete exerting yourself for hours a day then every two hours of activity try a pro:cho product of different ratios and see if if you notice a difference.

Third, the fine group III and IV afferents emerged as the prime neural substrate for these responses. These findings have withstood more than 30 years of rigorous investigation; they have been extended and together they form the basis for a large body of work on the reflex cardiovascular and respiratory responses to exercise.""

Since top speed sprinting depends on mechanics so much, you'll run into suggestions of 10% BW for weighted sled drags so that you have minimal impact on running form. However, for football you are rarely in a position where you are reaching top linear speed, it is much more about acceleration and multidirection agility. I've had great results with doing (as DeFranco calls them) heavy ass sled drags. I do them in all four directions and practice my crossover step when I'm doing them sideways.  For programming HASDs I usually do them after lifting in the off season and during the season or preseason I will do them as a separate conditioning workout.

AdvancedFitness,2mtbjk,middleweight,2,Thu Nov 20 01:34:05 2014 UTC,"In what way are the mechanics off? Shin angle, body position, stride length? How does it create bad mechanics? Youve said it develops bad mechanics, but not what these are."
AdvancedFitness,2mtbjk,MHath,3,Thu Nov 20 02:25:00 2014 UTC,"He's speaking a little harshly, but what he's saying is true.  10% BW for top speed stuff and about 20% BW for acceleration stuff (what you'd be doing if your focus is your 40 yard time.)  When you have excessive weight, your stride becomes so slow, that your tendons aren't absorbing and releasing energy like they would be in a quick explosive movement.  On the subject of form, you end up straining in a way that causes your form to break down.  You need such exaggerated movements that it causes your body to twist, or you end up pushing off the ground diagonally, instead of straight forward, so you're bouncing back and forth between left and right, which is not a habit you want, if you want to be fast.  Excessively weighted sled pulls are just not an effective use of your time, and it won't have much carry over to sprinting at all, except in a very untrained athlete that will get less out of shape by doing just about anything."
AdvancedFitness,2mtbjk,middleweight,5,Thu Nov 20 04:23:29 2014 UTC,"You dont sprint though, you walk. I'm not sure sprinting mechanics are a concern when the aim of the exercise is to increase force production through hip extension. The exercise is more comparable to a squat than a sprint in my opinion, in terms of goal. Does squatting negatively effect sprint mechanics?"
AdvancedFitness,2mtbjk,MHath,4,Thu Nov 20 04:25:57 2014 UTC,"I was under the impression he was talking about running with almost BW from the comments, but I just watched the video and saw the ridiculous amount of weight they are pulling.  They are not getting good hip extension in the video.  You're not getting anything out of it that you wouldn't get from just doing a Bulgarian split squat or weighted hip thrust/glute bridge, which doesn't require a whole additional set of equipment.  The whole idea of it just strikes me as ""Let's make a video and show off an exercise that you can only do here, so people will come to use our facility.""  The lift may not be detrimental, but it is completely unnecessary at best.  Squatting with good form will not negatively affect sprint mechanics."
AdvancedFitness,2mtbjk,middleweight,0,Thu Nov 20 04:42:26 2014 UTC,"Ive never programmed heavy sled drags. I totally agree re body position and quad involvement. Im not sure I worry about contact times when increasing force production, but i think lack of heel strike makes the exercise flawed."
AdvancedFitness,2mtbjk,MHath,5,Thu Nov 20 05:07:47 2014 UTC,"That bodybuilding.com video has some fine drills in it, but you really need some sprinting workouts to get fast.  The most important part of these workouts, if you are to get the full effect out of them, is the recovery time.  You need a minute of recover per 10 meters you just ran, and when you recover from a set, take 6+ minutes to recover.  If you don't follow the prescribed recovery time, your central nervous system will not have recovered in time, and you will end up working your endurance instead of your acceleration.  You would start with sprints of 10-20 meters in length at about 95-100% effort.  When you can do that distance correctly with good form, you progress up to 30 meters then 40 meters.  These workouts wouldn't total more than 500 meters in any given workout.    An example of a first workout could be something like 5x10m, 5x20m, 5x20m. That could progress into 3x(5x20m), then into 5x10m, 5x20m, 5x30m.  Eventually you get up to 3x(4x40m).    You can do these workouts 2-3 times a week, and it would be good to start off alternating between doing these workouts on flat ground and doing them up a hill.    This will get your acceleration to be much better.  If you're interested in increasing your max speed and speed endurance, let me know."
AdvancedFitness,2mtbjk,OnCompanyTime,1 point,Thu Nov 20 05:21:54 2014 UTC,Great post! Will this carry over to maximum sprinting speed? Or is there a way to train that separately?
AdvancedFitness,2mtbjk,MHath,2,Thu Nov 20 05:37:08 2014 UTC,"There would be a little carry over, but there are better ways to improve max speed directly.  Things that directly affect max sprint speed would be plyometric exercises and 'fly runs'.  A fly run is when you gradually accelerate up to max speed over about 30m, then sprint at max speed for a certain distance.  Usually new sprinters would start with a fly 10m, then move up to eventually fly 30m or 40m.  You generally want to get to be good at the accelerating part before doing fly runs.  You can always do plyometrics, though.  Start with lighter plyometrics and work up to more intense ones."

AdvancedFitness,2msys0,KRNMERCILESS,5,Wed Nov 19 20:26:55 2014 UTC,"Absolute garbage for just about any purpose. Fmax will never be as high as bilateral exercises. The exercises are not truly unilateral. Bss are inherently unstable, and thus unsafe, again limiting your ability to increase fmax. Further the rear leg almost always contributes to the movement. Your time is better spent on bilateral leg exercises in almost every situation"
AdvancedFitness,2msys0,mrcosmicna,2,Thu Nov 20 06:26:33 2014 UTC,"""Isn't truly unilateral"" is getting a little into semantics, isn't it? ;)   I kid, I kid. You're absolutely right, but the way I see it the contribution of the rear leg would be significantly less than when compared to bilateral activation?  And in regards to the instability? If you throw someone under a barbell and try and have them do ANY exercise that they are unfamiliar with, they're going to be unstable. Ensuring the person has adequate foot stability, body awareness and has progressed into a BB BSS properly (from mastering the squat, to BW split squat, to BW BSS, to goblet BSS, to 2DB BSS, THEN FINALLY to barbell) will ensure that the person isn't going to perform it unsafely.   I'm sorry if I didn't make this clear... Bilateral leg exercises SHOULD and NEED to be the staple for strength training programs."
AdvancedFitness,2msys0,mrcosmicna,4,Thu Nov 20 07:00:34 2014 UTC,"I understand... I still hesitate because I truly believe that they can't be loaded through the same range of motion safely as a squat, back or front. Plus, form degradation entails a lateral pevil shift coupled with spinal hyperextension which is not good. And stability will always come back to get you. I've never failed a squat or seen someone fail a squat because they were unstable. The obverse is untrue for unilateral work of any nature (including dumbell pressing).  If you want to increase tonnage, the best approach is via 3-6 back off sets of 6-10 at 50-60%1rm. No need for exercise variation - just more work in a shorter timeframe"
AdvancedFitness,2msys0,mrcosmicna,0,Thu Nov 20 07:06:06 2014 UTC,"That is a marvelous point.   I actually programmed BB BSS this month, so I'm interested to see how this will work."

Any movement anybody programs in should be based off goals, and if your sport/activity includes unilateral-ish movements (yoke, farmer's walk), then they have some applicability. For powerlifting, probably not so much.   Of course you could probably make the argument that time would be better spent doing the exact unilateral activity instead of Bulgarian split squats or whatever. I dunno."

AdvancedFitness,2mq4py,StuWard,5,Wed Nov 19 01:25:16 2014 UTC,"The biggest issue for me is that there is no lifting involved. If the total number of calories ingested is the same, and the total calories burned during cardio is the same, the outcome should be similar. Where else should the calories go, if no muscle growth is being stimulated by lifting?  For me it would be more interesting to do the same experiment, but lift on the non-cardio days. I'd expect the FASTED group to have a similar fat loss, but no or negative total weight loss. During fasted cardio they burn more fat (due to empty glycogen stores), but then use part of the shake for muscle protein synthesis. The FED group would have less of the shake available for MPS cause they consume/burn it during cardio.  Or maybe it's broscience and I'm completely off my rocker.  Edit: Also, what would be the effects on a bulk?"

AdvancedFitness,2mq4py,jewniggery,8,Wed Nov 19 13:42:17 2014 UTC,"The thing that's odd about that study is that they fed participants (from both groups) a ""recovery"" drink after their exercise sessions. As the drinks contained non-trivial amounts of carbohydrates, I would assume that the participants would stop fat metabolism and instead switch to metabolising the drink that they just consumed.   As such, wouldn't the difference between the groups be reduced compared to if they remained fasted until their next meal?  As it stands, the only difference in energy use would be during the period of exercise itself, and not the post exercise period where a significant amount of energy use occurs."

That's what studies do, they test a hypothesis.  This study, however, did not test that particular one.  Probably because very few people work out and then fast for hours afterward.     the only difference in energy use would be during the period of exercise itself,    Right, and this paper shows that energy use during the period of exercise itself makes no difference.     and not the post exercise period where a significant amount of energy use occurs.

Some may lose 1%, others may lose 12% no matter the group. If you have only a few participants, chances are high that if you randomly assign them to groups, one group might by chance get a few more high-responders. Just meet with a friend and roll a dice and if you only roll it a few times, it is pretty likely that one of you will have a higher number. As you roll the dice more often this luck factor will become lower and lower, but this study only had 10 people in each group.  If the probability that the differences are observed by chance alone is less than 5%, it is said to be significant.

If now one of these groups that only consist of a few people by chance gets a few more of the people who adhere very well to the diet as an example, this group will lose more fat on average even though the training itself has nothing to do with it.  This is always a problem with low sample sizes. Roll a dice with your friend, each of you 5 times. Do you expect the sum of the dice rolls to be exactly the same between you and your friend? No, likely one will have a bit more just by chance. Just like one group in this fitness study by chance might include a few more of the people that lose fat more easily in studies."

AdvancedFitness,2mq4py,xediii,1 point,Fri Nov 21 13:08:38 2014 UTC,"If you check the full paper i'm sure the standard deviation is mentioned. Then you can calculate how likely the observed difference is to be observed by chance alone. Usually if this is more likely than 5%, it is not significant. This does not mean there can't be a difference, but the difference is too low or the sample size is too low to make chance unlikely enough of an explanation.  The averages only bring it in line if you got a large enough sample size or small enough variability. This study mainly provided evidence that the hypothesis it was set to answer - that fasted training results in more fat loss - could not be substantiated. There is of course a chance that the observed difference would be significant with more people involved, but no one knows that.  If there would be a huge difference caused by fasted training that is larger than the difference between individuals in the same groups, this would likely have been significant. So if anything I suppose this study shows that this likely was not the case here."

I cannot find the p value for the interaction between group and time, but the authors mention that it is not significant, so it is probably higher than 0.05. This would mean that if you would theoretically repeat the experiment over and over again, you would expect to find the 5% advantage or more by chance at least 5 out of 100 times despite there not being an actual difference."

It is in your best interest to demand to see a certificate of analysis on your products, from a current batch.  If the company won't provide one, it isn't worth your time and money.

However, bigger clearance of testosterone fromcirculation to somewhere else cannot be excluded.   Just because measured levels of testosterone after workout are seen doesn't mean it is bad."

AdvancedFitness,2mablh,TheseIdleHands84,10,Fri Nov 14 14:33:08 2014 UTC,"From my understanding, the fibres don't necessarily ""convert"" from type I to type II, or from IIa to IIx, rather type I/IIa fibres take on certain type IIx characteristics the longer an individual is sedentary.   For example, muscle fibres that used to be tuned to endurance (slow twitch fibres) will begin to fatigue more easily due to things like decreased capillarization, mitochondrial density, and glycogen stores (similar to fast twitch fibres)."

AdvancedFitness,2mablh,lukaskywalker,1 point,Fri Nov 14 22:46:25 2014 UTC,"The term ""convert"" is open to interpretation, but fiber types shift in such a way that none of our methods of distinguishing fiber types can tell previously IIa types from original IIx types. To me, that's fiber type conversion."
AdvancedFitness,2mablh,Strikerrjones,4,Fri Nov 14 17:09:23 2014 UTC,"Yep, this is how it works. When you train in any way, fiber types tend to convert a little bit towards the ""slow twitch"" end of the continuum. We're not sure why this happens yet, because you'd think it would be more beneficial to maintain type IIx fibers instead of getting more type IIa fibers, but it's possible that IIx fibers don't have much potential to hypertrophy, whereas the conversion to IIa lets them get bigger and overall produce more force. As far as I know, that's just speculation though. Also, if you control for cross sectional area, the force produced by the different types of muscle fibers is all just about the same; the rate of force production is different, but on the scale of the entire body, you speedier movements just by increasing force - which you do by making muscles bigger.  In chronic activation studies, like electrically stimulating mammal muscles for long periods of time each day or constantly, you get a huge shift toward pure slow twitch fibers, but the fibers also atrophy so you get less force production.  With detraining/unloading, you get a shift back towards fast twitch fibers, but they also atrophy and get smaller, so you lose force production and muscular endurance.  With short bursts of high activity, like resistance training, you get a slight shift towards slow twitch, but the fibers get considerably bigger."
AdvancedFitness,2mablh,Strikerrjones,2,Fri Nov 14 17:07:40 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure the jury is out on whether or not fibers are actually converted from type I to type II. I don't think there has been a definitive study done that proves it either way which means you're probably opening up a can of worms here.  But hey, that's what Reddit is for right! :-)"

AdvancedFitness,2mablh,Najda,2,Fri Nov 14 15:13:57 2014 UTC,"There's actually really cool research on this in the area of space medicine. If you mechanically unload (check out hindlimb-unloading) a rodent's rear limbs, you can see a multitude of effects, including a fiber type switch from I to II. Now, all that means is that from a cross sectional analysis of the soleus or gastroc between an unloaded muscle and loaded control, there are significantly more type II fibers in the unloaded limb. If you're interested in this stuff, google something like ""Hindlimb unloading fiber type,"" and you should get some good results. There's a lot of work that's being done on both muscle and bone deterioration/atrophy due to the mechanical unloading in space or in prolonged bed rest patients."

They'll twist, you won't express force symmetrically and you'll receive different stimuli on your left and right side.  You might also subject certain joints to torque that you don't want.

I'm getting in the max amount of sport specific training I can. I agree with the mass and even the strength portion of what you said, which is why I thought I'd try a post here. I spend 1 or 2 days a week lifting because I can't strike on those days and I get bored. I have a hard time sprinting (always seem to pull something), but know I need better cardio. Any thoughts on a cardio program? I have the equipment due to my apartment gym complex containing those things, so no worries on wasted money."
AdvancedFitness,2lzrta,elbrontosaurus,3,Wed Nov 12 03:41:52 2014 UTC,"1-2x/week lifting if it's low-med reps (3-7/set) and big compounds is a good maintenance load, so no worries there.  Sprinting is rubbish for boxers.  First, it's the wrong energy system.  Second, it's a skill.  Third, risk of injury.  Don't sprint.  I swear, it's as much of a damn fad as kettlebells and battling ropes, and 99.9% of the people that mention it have no idea how intense those Tabata intervals are supposed to be.  Skipping rope in rounds, roadwork in round intervals with periodic bursts (""fartlek"" is what runners call this), these are traditional methods, but can add wear and tear to the joints.  Not as traditional, but lower on wear and tear, and lacking the eccentric portion that often causes soreness, try bicycling.  Indoor or outdoor, structure in rounds (on time with different random speeds, then coasting ""between rounds"").  Easy on the joints, no risk of injury, little soreness, fun scenery if outside, and most importantly, training the proper energy system."

One of the things I've noticed is that when the guys I roll with do S&C, they seem to be content with a certain level being enough to get the job done. Say a double body weight deadlift, a squat in the neighbourhood of 1.5x bodyweight, and other strength standards that are in that grey area when novice gains start to become harder to come by. They get far more out of time invested getting efficient at BJJ than they do spending time under the bar.  Since you're relatively new to Muay Thai at this level, I'd assume your skill acquisition will be really fast, so getting better at your sport might benefit you far more than time spent doing GPP.

Those movements will give you the most bang for your buck training wise, as you simply can't load as much and thus improve as much due to the instability of one legged training.

AdvancedFitness,2lvxar,JSCMI,8,Tue Nov 11 08:11:36 2014 UTC,"Not a study, but I wanted to point out Candito's video on the subject. His views are a bit against the norm but well reasoned.   He points out in the case of beginners, eating ~TDEE is effective for progress and therefore bulking/cutting is not necessary for developing muscle mass.   He also points out that more advanced trainees may see more muscle growth while bulking, but that if this is due to the training being ineffective on its own they will lose much or all of it when they cut, while if their training is effective the lack of clear evidence that bulking/cutting nets greater progress than eating ~TDEE means you are disrupting effective training for no clear benefit which is counter-intuitive. While it is true that progressing eating ~TDEE is very slow, the progress you can actually net after a full bulk/cut cycle is also very slow as you get more advanced.   The main exception, he points out, is people with significantly more body fat than they want / should have.   His view seems to be the whole idea of bulking/cutting is based on BB athletes that compete at BF levels that are unsustainable year-round.   The idea is compelling. How many years did mainstream weight trainers believe that high rep movements were magically fat burning and the only way to build muscle mass because that was how BB'ers trained (not being in a condition for near-1RM work) during contest prep?   Is bulking/cutting a similar mis-application of a BBer-specific habit?  Lyle McDonald's article Initial Body Fat and Body Composition Changes is frequently ""cited"" as a sound explanation of the benefits of training in the 10-15% BF range. But when you read the article, he never actually makes a case that progress is optimal there. He does suggest it is, but as you follow his reasoning it ends up being that he believes 10-15% BF is more aesthetic and that it is inefficient for athletes who need to be lean to compete to get too far from competition leanness.   Another case to look at is powerlifters. If it were true that fat mass were so estrenogenic anything above 15% or (gasp) 20% BF inhibited progress, wouldn't powerlifters typically be very lean?"
AdvancedFitness,2lvxar,nigelregal,1 point,Tue Nov 11 14:04:22 2014 UTC,"I'm confused by Canditos point of view. How would a lean athlete gain muscle eating more or less TDEE?

AdvancedFitness,2lvxar,Maharichie,1 point,Tue Nov 11 17:32:00 2014 UTC,They wouldn't. He suggests someone that lean eat at a slight surplus until / unless they get to the upper range of a desirable range of body fat and then to recomp eating around TDEE until they get leaner again.   Basically he's advocating a cycle of bulking as slowly as possible and recomping at TDEE as necessary to keep fat mass from getting out of control rather than cutting weight. He's not saying that's necessarily optimal but he thinks that without clear evidence either way it's probably going to be less problematic for typical trainees.
AdvancedFitness,2lvxar,AhmedF,3,Tue Nov 11 18:37:10 2014 UTC,"Studies need funding. Problem with finding a study like this is what does it solve?   A study like this would have to be very long and cost a lot of money.  What you probably need to do is find studies with body composition changes and look at the data to see what it says. If the study uses food recalls most people will likely ignore the data as you can just say ""well the people who had results at more or less than TDEE""  Also, most studies you will find have obese or diseased people or elderly as a subject when it comes to weight loss or gain from fat/muscle.

It's also interesting that this was performed with repetition ranges that deal with muscular endurance, yet they suggest in that the conclusion that this can improve strength after 8 weeks. I think this ""Strength"" increase is just 8 weeks of neuromuscular improvement that comes from 8 weeks of practicing and using the knee extensor machine, since there doesn't seem to be any CSA increase.   But perhaps there is some Post-activation-potentiation? I'm more confused on what ""exhaustive exercise"" means. Till failure?  EDIT: I'm sure the full study goes into more detail.

However, most of us also care about body composition in addition to total body mass. One needs to pay attention to macros and exercise, in addition to the requirement of a calorie deficit, if they want to lose fat without losing too much hard-earned muscle.

AdvancedFitness,2ltwja,d-cent,1 point,Mon Nov 10 16:56:09 2014 UTC,"I have never really given much thought to the fat burning zone.   I know a lot of regular people don't really want to lose weight they just want to lose fat. Are you saying if you really tried you could isolate just fat loss and reduce the amount of lean mass you lose?   Obviously, you would have to consume a matching diet where you consume the appropriate macros but at a deficit equal to the calories burned during cardio."
AdvancedFitness,2ltwja,psylenced,5,Mon Nov 10 14:26:01 2014 UTC,"There's always a mix of weight loss, both lean tissue and fatty tissue.  Just as it's practically impossible to gain only muscle, there's always a bit of fat gain as well (which is why bodybuilders alternate between bulking and cutting).  This is aside from the fact that water weight/retention fluctuates wildly and confuses a lot of people, esp. those just starting a low-carb diet.  The idea is to adjust the mix, i.e. predominantly bias the gain or loss to one or the other.  In the case of weight loss which you want to bias towards mostly fat and not too much lean weight, this is why you want to exercise as well as diet and why doing some strength training is very valuable.    Similarly, your body pretty much never burns exclusively one fuel or another, it almost always burns a mix of fuels (carbs, fats, ATP).  Even the explosive movements that immediately burn lots of ATP, guess what the body does to replace that ATP in the muscle?  It does so using other energy sources.  The closest anyone comes to burning 100% only one fuel type (fat) is sleeping or complete rest, really.  Now, this is where the whole ""fat loss zone"" confuses a lot of lay people.  They think it's super great for losing bunches of fat, which is exactly WRONG.  It's super great for burning a mix that is mostly fats while still exercising, but because it's low intensity, it doesn't burn a lot of calories per minute.  Math, would you rather burn 100 calories that were 90% from fat, or 200 calories that were 50% from fat?  In the latter case, you not only burn more total fat, but burn more total calories.  And if you burn more total calories, then (assuming the same input) you'll lose more total weight, because when you burn the extra carbs  during the run, afterwards, your body will shift its mix during rest and draw the needed caloric deficit from your body fat.

To use some exaggerated examples to explain this:  Compare   1 - burning 99% fat, 1% carbs/glucose at rate of 100 calories per hour.  2 - burning 10% fat, 90% carbs/glucose at rate of 600 calories per hour.  In 1, the fat burning zone, you burn more fat as a percentage, but less calories.   In 2, you burn more calories, which your body will eventually take from body fat if you're in a deficit."
AdvancedFitness,2ltwja,Electric_Banana,-4,Tue Nov 11 01:57:26 2014 UTC,"You might be correct in theory, but in reality, not so much.  Being in a calorie deficit means for most of us we become injury prone when there's intensity to be had, for example I know that if I try to do circuit HIIT in a time period where I'm low in calories/glycogen, the chances are I'm going to injure myself or put my body in a position where it cannot recover efficiently.  But what I do know is that I can run 8 miles up and down hills in under an hour, burn a ton of calories and stay injury free, why? Because running for me isn't tough on my body in terms of getting a potential injury (you're running in a straight line, the stress is on the big lower muscles mainly, you're not twisting and turning stressing out parts of the body that might be slightly weak).  Again with the time periods, I know that when I'm low in glycogen, the worst thing I can go and do is spend 45 minutes boxing, again boxing relies a lot on intense energy/glycogen and it's not something I want to put my body through when it's lacking.  And then there's the whole dilemma of HIIT/HIT being stressful in general regardless of diet, it's why Football/Soccer players are very injury prone, it's very easy to twist an ankle or tear a hamstring when sprinting or moving in an explosive action.  So I think for me, I'd rather run 2-4 times a week and tap into the ""fat burning"" zone rather than burn myself out a few times a week for the extra calorie ""burn"" and end up injuring myself for 6 weeks.  I do agree on your diet/exercise point though, it's VERY hard to ""outrun"" a bad diet, I've tried both, and it's a no brainer, macros/calories are king with fat loss."
AdvancedFitness,2ltwja,RawMuscleLab,3,Mon Nov 10 06:56:02 2014 UTC,"While injuries are certainly an important factor, I believe that can be mitigated by choosing the right exercise. For example, HIIT on a stationary bike or while swimming would probably be as safe.  Something I would consider as another factor is how HIIT can be so much more taxing to someone on a caloric deficit. One can easily train himself to the ground when not cautious enough and burn out. I cannot explain its physiological basis but it's very intuitive. Lyle McDonald also took note of that and that's why he would recommend to restrict strenuous activities while on a severe caloric deficit. He also recommends LISS over HIIT for that matter."

Which means, if you're doing a half hour and it's easy, step it up so it ain't.  Which is going to be more intense than the ""zone.""  And 7.5 mph for an hour is more intense than that zone, for most of us.  I also didn't suggest severe caloric restriction, just pointed out that restriction is necessary to lose fat."
AdvancedFitness,2ltwja,fatsynatsy,5,Mon Nov 10 12:36:57 2014 UTC,"Fact in a sense that intensity determines whether you burn fat for fuel or carbs for fuel.  Like smcaulii mentions, higher intensity burns a higher ratio of carbs to fat while lower ratios burn a higher ratio of fat to carbs.   So a light jog would burn majority FAT and some carbs, and the slower you go (jog slower to brisk walking to slow walking etc) the higher the ratio of fat you'll burn. Sleeping will be when you burn the highest ratio of fat for energy (yes you're still burning calories while you sleep).  But like hastywilliam said, just because you burn a higher ratio of fat doesn't mean you're burning more calories. During an all out sprint you'll be burning way more total calories than a walk of the same duration. So despite the lower RATIO of fat you'll burn, you actually burn a higher TOTAL amount of fat than if you walked for the same amount of time.  source - bachelor's degree in exercise science"
AdvancedFitness,2ltwja,Heroine4Life,1 point,Mon Nov 10 06:34:15 2014 UTC,good answer. also wanted to add - sprinting and other high intensity cardio activity makes you burn more calories in the 24 hour period after your workout. lower intensity cardio doesn't give you that.
AdvancedFitness,2ltwja,truefelt,-1,Sun Nov 23 05:51:10 2014 UTC,"During an all out sprint you'll be burning way more total calories than a walk of the same duration.   Right.   So despite the lower RATIO of fat you'll burn, you actually burn a higher TOTAL amount of fat than if you walked for the same amount of time.   Wrong — unless you're now referring to the amount of fat burned during the course of the entire day.  The contribution of fat to powering an all-out sprint is virtually zero, right? So there must be a point where an increase in exercise intensity actually begins to decrease the absolute rate of fat oxidation even though energy consumption keeps going up. This point is precisely the famous ""fat-burning zone"" around ~65% VO2max. For lower intensities your statement is of course correct."
AdvancedFitness,2ltwja,QuietlyPanicking,0,Mon Nov 10 07:06:36 2014 UTC,"Actually he's correct. As you increase the intensity of exercise your body will never burn less fat, only more carbohydrate. So proportionately more fat is burned at a lower intensity but total fat over time will be most when intensity is highest.  The fat burning zone only refers to the intensity at which the highest proportion of fat will be burnt, but the reason it would be used is that i'ts much easier to maintain this intensity for a longer period of time, therefore burning more fat overall."
AdvancedFitness,2ltwja,truefelt,1 point,Mon Nov 10 09:06:29 2014 UTC,"This image nicely explains it better.  This is given in absolute values not %, so yes fat oxidation does decrease."
AdvancedFitness,2ltwja,QuietlyPanicking,0,Mon Nov 10 15:09:45 2014 UTC,"Sorry but no. Fat oxidation cannot sustain very intense activity, hence fat utilization during sprinting, for example, is nonexistent.  This stuff isn't anything new; the 65% VO2max range was identified already in the 1990s.  Have a look at this review, specifically the figure on the second page: Modulation of carbohydrate and fat utilization by diet, exercise and environment (PDF)."
AdvancedFitness,2ltwja,smcaulii,0,Mon Nov 10 09:19:48 2014 UTC,Depends on duration. A 400 meter sprint will take like ~1.5-2 minutes for an average person. Even with the relatively low ratio of fat contribution you're gunna burn a lot more total fat in 90s of your hardest sprinting than 90s of your slowest walking. The time of maximal exercise that equal contributions are taken from the anaerobic and aerobic energy systems happens a lot earlier what's traditionally been suggested (back when we thought that energy systems respond to the demands of intense exercise in an almost sequential manner).  I'm very open to any studies or anything that you know of that argue against this though. I was gunna bust out the respiratory exchange ratio and math out some hypothetical examples but got lazy to .. do that.

It describes the crossover effect. Essentially, at around 45-55% of your VO2max, your body begins switching to carbohydrates as a fuel source. You'll still be burning some fat at higher intensities, but the ratio of fat:carb utilization decreases."

Doing this for potentially 6-8 exercises per workout takes forever and almost just makes it easier to type the whole thing out.  As others have mentioned it is nice to have a big list structured by bodypart or type of movement but if you already know what you want, then I would much prefer searching by name.  I'd personally prefer to be able to start typing in a search box and have some dropdown suggestions come up.  e.g. typing in bench press might come up with a few options ""bench press - incline"" ""bench press- flat"" and you may have some modifiers like ""wide grip"", ""close grip"" etc."

We have a search box that is by exercise root name, like bench press, and all the bench press options come up in the list (as pics). You can further specify the search with things like incline, decline (body/leg/arm position and angle), in addition to other qualifiers like force (push/pull, upper/lower), focus (compound, isolation, dynamic, explosive, stretch, etc), and grip/handle. You can search by as many or few tags as possible and the list that shows up will react accordingly.   We wanted to make the search in a way that if you are looking for a specific exercise variation, you can drill right down to it with one search, but if you are looking for a group of exercises (like 6-8) you can do a search that returns a list with those types of exercises to choose from.

Last year I bought a tub of Vitargo which is basically just a lot of carbs that are digested very well and designed to help promote efficient glucose and protein intake to the muscles. I was super skeptical at first because I was mixing it into my protein shakes and it was essentially just carbs... But I had a lot of gains from it. I was also bulking at the time, so it might have just been my bulk, but that was the strongest I've ever been. So do a a lot of carbs for postworkout in conjunction with protein really help stimulate growth and efficiency?"

I've read some literature that pseudoepherine closely mimics that fat burner and CNS stimulating effect of ephedrine but 2.5 times less efficacious per mg, so you'd have to take 2.5 times as much.  I'll run through a 24 count blister pack, taking one 30mg pill at a time per workout and take a month or two break.  It works out pretty well.  Ephedrine had a better better mental effect, but pseudoepherine works well enough."

You shouldn't need either one as a PWO though that's as good a time as any to take them.  BA's famous tingling sensation is not related to its performance benefits, or at least no short-term stimulatory-like performance boost has been demonstrated in the literature. If you get tingling you can avoid it if you want by taking it with food or worst case splitting your dose up (I think L-Citrulline is often taken multiple times a day rather than all at once as well)."

However, I'd start by getting a basic idea of how many calories you are burning at rest. Either use a BMR or RMR calculator and see how many calories you are burning a day. Then take into account how many calories you expend by training and add them together. Use MyFitnessPal to see how many additional calories to eat per day.  As far as training. For athletes I would go with something called an undulating periodization program. Which means changing the training goal of each workout. I would go 3 whole body workouts a week and go with sport specific movements. If you have more questions just let me know.

What it seems like I'm going to do is focus on gaining mass and strength for the first 3-4 months and then transition into the CHP programming just swapping out the different running workouts for equivalently taxing biking/swimming workouts sometimes.
AdvancedFitness,2kzm7h,QuazieMoFo,2,Mon Nov 3 22:48:44 2014 UTC,"I hope you don't mind me tagging along on your post, but I'm in a similar situation and would like some feedback as well. If I don't get any responses I'll just make a new thread.   Male  6'1 195 lbs  ~19-20%bf BP: 205lbs Squat: 255lbs Deadlift: 280lbs   I've been lifting weights since July using the Ice Cream Fitness program with mixtures of cardio sprinkled in. I've gotten stronger and lost 8-10 pounds in the process. Because of the holidays and being burned out on eating at a calorie deficit, I decided to try and use the 2-3 months to add what muscle I can.  Anyways, I'm still not quite to the bf% I'd like to be at so in January I plan to start the weight loss process again. I recently ran a 4 mile race for charity with work at an 8:13 pace. I know it's not blazing fast, but I hadn't ran in over 3 months so I was pretty proud to say the least. All I had been doing was 15 minute HIIT on the elliptical a couple times a week.   Anyways, a coworker has asked me to do a sprint triathlon with him in July. I figured this would be a great way to motivate myself by having a specific goal to train for and allow me to get rid of some of the extra fat. FWIW, the triathlon is a 500 meter swim, 13 mile bike, 3 mile run.   Specifically, my goal is to lose body fat, maintain what strength/muscle I've gained, and obviously do well at the triathlon. I think I could probably complete the triathlon right now, but I want to do better than just complete it.   Anyways, here is the plan I've come up with and I would like some feedback if possible.   January to March I really want to lose body fat while getting my body used to running, swimming, and biking. To accomplish this, I'm thinking calorie deficit, probably 2200 calories a day. I estimate my maintenance calorie intake to be 2600 at rest plus what I burn while working out.   MWF continuing with ice cream fitness minus the accessory work at 3x5, so squats, deadlift, ohp, bench press, and rows. My thought here is that this will allow me to hopefully maintain my strength and muscle mass. On Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, alternate between spin class, swimming, and running. I've also considered doing 15 minutes of HIIT on the elliptical post lifting weights.   Because this is a sprint triathlon, I don't see a need for excessive endurance work or running, swimming, and biking for long periods of time. The first few months I want to focus on getting used to the three events and building speed and power. I imagine the endurance needed for this event can be built fairly easily since it's a sprint so that's not a huge concern to me, especially early on. I'm not sure what to do after March assuming I get the weight off I need to. Ideally I'd be between 180-183 pounds, but that's something for me to still think on.   I don't plan on competing in triathlons on a regular basis and if I do I imagine they will all be sprints. Ultimately I want to build muscle and get bigger, but I see this as a way to check something off my bucket list and get some weight off.    Any thoughts, advice, or feedback?"

We now define a hazard; death, fracture, birthday parties with clowns.  We define a time period (20 years).  If our control group has a rate of death at 5% per year, and our test group has rate of death at 10%, we have a hazard ratio of 2 for our test group (and 1 for the control, as we arbitrarly set it).   In survival analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) is the ratio of the hazard rates corresponding to the conditions described by two levels of an explanatory variable. For example, in a drug study, the treated population may die at twice the rate per unit time as the control population. The hazard ratio would be 2, indicating higher hazard of death from the treatment. Or in another study, men receiving the same treatment may suffer a certain complication ten times more frequently per unit time than women, giving a hazard ratio of 10..   So from their graphs they are proposing that they observed that high milk drinkers died more frequently, at almost 3 times the rate.  An almost 3 hazard ratio for mortality for heavy milk drinking sounds crazy to me.   Meta-analyses of cohort studies on the association between milk intake and mortality11 and fractures12 13 have shown significant heterogeneity between studies. In the higher milk consumption category, for  example,some show lower mortality rates and some show higher[...] Our present investigation should not be evaluated in isolation and its merits should be judged in light of other study findings"

To delve into it slightly for others out there, Irisin has been found to upregulate PGC-1 alpha 4 isoform, which has been shown to upregulate IGF-1, repress myostatin, and increase hypertrophy.  One of my worries is the fact they've shown Irisin, like many other hormonal factors, downregulates upon exogenous administration.. so it makes me believe Ursolic Acid probably doesn't upregulate Irisin enough to cause too significant of changes if it doesn't also cause downregulation.  Notwithstanding, Irisin would probably be quite good for fat loss, if anything (so thus Ursolic Acid), as Irisin upregulates UCP expression, increases HSL & ATGL expression, inhibits PPAR-gamma and FAS, and also activates/upregulates PPAR-alpha."

GTG was coined by pavel tsatsouline he an ex Spetnaz physical trainer, half his stuff is overhyped BS IMO but some is good like this endurance technique.  An example of a grease the groovea program is 50-75% max reps 3-5 times a day with at least an hour of rest between sets 3-5 times a week. I usually did it for 2 weeks and took a full week off and would see my max jump by 10-20% some people have used this program successfully for strength training as well like one-armed pull-up. Anecdotally in the long term it isn't good for hypertrophy though because you never reach failure or near failure in training  I don't like your plan because i'm afraid it would hamper strength which IS going to help your endurance once you force endurance facilitation by practicing your specific endurance event enough but the key is to get sufficient volume of the endurance event you want to get better at.   I don't have a study on any of this so i've includes that this is anecdotal and perhaps not ""advanced fitness worthy"" but i thought it would help OP out."
AdvancedFitness,2kmxw2,DREADLOCKSS,3,Wed Oct 29 13:07:13 2014 UTC,"It really depends on your training level.  At lower levels of training you can get away with it as your need for specificity is lower, but as you reach higher levels of performance (competitive lifting, competitive running, etc) the need to specify what you train for in a given session or training cycle becomes higher so that your nervous system can adapt.    As far as ""ideally"" training for both, the best thing you can do to get more endurance is get stronger.  The guy that can bench 300lbs weighing 185 can more than likely do more pushups than the guy that's benching 200 at the same weight.  3x5 or 5x5 programs for bench are great from beginners and intermediates strength wise.  Performing that as your first emphasis, then doing your 4x40 pushups would be your best bet."
AdvancedFitness,2kmxw2,Treebeard560,1 point,Thu Oct 30 02:43:03 2014 UTC,"I did this for about a year during my workouts except at 3 sets of 10 bench press and 20 pushups in-between. What I found is my bench power went down, but my ability to do higher reps went apeshit. After about a year I could pump out 25-30 reps of 135lbs no problem, and I was proud of that. If you really work for those extra reps and fail at the end of your sets (much safer to fail out doing pushups), your ability to grind through high rep sets goes way up. I guess that's how it helped me the most, I was able to burn out and ensure my arms and chest couldn't hold a static flex at the end of the superset. Negative movement bench press is also really good to pair with pushups because you can slow down flexion to simulate the same movement. This works much more towards training max strength and muscular endurance at the same time. You won't get very big doing more than 5 reps per set though, 10 reps is my favorite number - easy to adjust."

It is the free lipids under going beta oxidation and subsequent entry into (beta oxidation happens in the mitochonria) then further oxidation of FADH2, Actyl CoA,and NADH in the mitochondria.  Lipid mobilization would be the amount of lipids that exit lipid stores (adipose and liver) to be used by other tissues either for lipid oxidation or other bodily functions.

The main issue I have with the study is this: The author finds out that a high caloric deficit leads to loss of lean mass. So far so good. The issue is that he then draws the conclusion this loss of lean mass is caused by a limit on the energy transfer from fat deposits.  It might very well be an alternative explanation, like the fact that people who consume only about 40 grams of protein a day in a starvation experiment are expected to lose lean mass for that reason alone.   You could do the same model with a caloric deficit of only 100 kcal yet limit people to 10 grams of protein per day. You would estimate that the limit on energy transfer from fat has to be below 100 calories daily as people will lose lean mass. Thats why I would like to see some research on what roughly the maximum amount of fat is that can be released per kilogram in a day. I suspect his conclusion is based on the wrong assumption that the only thing that can explain loss of lean mass is a limit on energy transfer from fat stores.  It does not appear like his 'new' number is derived in a different way?  I am kinda disappointed at Lyles response as well, he should have mentioned that obvious caveat more extensively.

AdvancedFitness,2kl7iv,CuriouslyCultured,1 point,Wed Oct 29 07:31:45 2014 UTC,"Dr. Eades in his article ""Is a calorie always a calorie?"" cites the book ""The Great Starvation Experiment"" and says they ate 100 grams:   The men in this study consumed macronutrients in the following amounts daily: protein 100 gm, fat 30 gm, and carbohydrate 225 gm.   I don't have access to Keys' original books so I can't check their actual intakes myself, I was hoping you had a source that had verified the intakes."
AdvancedFitness,2kl7iv,TunaBoo,2,Wed Oct 29 22:27:23 2014 UTC,"Ok, after reading your post, I first checked the meal and found it contains much less than 25,5% protein per kcal. Then I started googling a bit and found this: This makes for about 50g protein a day presuming the other meal was equal in protein content or actually a high carb diet..   I don't see how with the foods mentioned or ""potatoes, rutabagas, turnips, bread and macaroni"" you could get that much protein with that little calories. It does not add up and something is off, if all of the foods that are usually ingested contain far below 25% protein per kcal its not possible that people consume 25% protein per kcal in total. I send Mr. Eades a small email - maybe he will reply.  Edit: Eades also responded in his own blog post   I included the menu for Supper #2 because that was the only specific meal presented in the book. And, according to the author, who interviewed all of the subjects still living, that was the favorite meal. The fact that it is #2 implies that there are a number of other meals. With the time and attention Keys put into this study – which, BTW, could never be repeated today for ethical reasons – I’m sure there was 100 g protein per day.   This sounds more and more off. There was only 1 meal specified in the book. The food choices should resemble diets during the latter stages of war and are specified as containing almost no meat. You can't consume 25,5% protein with bread and potatoes.  Edit2: Two papers also mention the amount of protein in the starvation experiment: This and this, both mention ~ 50 gram of protein per day. This seems more reliable to me, both of them agree. I will stop looking now, I'm pretty sure it was low protein."
AdvancedFitness,2kl7iv,yetanothernerd,1 point,Thu Oct 30 08:48:20 2014 UTC,"As both studies cites Keys' actual study I think we can pretty much say it's confirmed to be ~50g protein per day, which probably isn't enough (especially with calorie restriction).

I don't play rball (want to try it actually) but I've been doing rock climbing about 3 times a week and fencing Wednesday nights. I still try to get at least 3 days at the gym if not more if I can by doubling up.   I found doing HIIT that has a strength component really effective. For me the Bear Complex really helps as you can really load on the weight (as you see fit) and still get a really good full body cardio work out. One draw back with the Bear is your legs can work out much more then your arms. So I added a set of lunges (with db) and a wall sit before starting each set.   For weights, I noticed its not as easy as it was just being a gym rat. For the main work outs I've been playing with this routine that I kind of made up on the fly. I do a warm up set, followed by two heavy lifts, and then I do two low weight burn  sets. I'm not as strong as you, but my numbers for example for a dead lift was:  Warm up: 205 x 8 (once) heavy lift 275 x 5 (twice) light burn 135 x 12 (twice)  This way I can push my heavy lifts every week, but not get to tense and constricted by then doing high rep work outs that limber you out.   also make sure you are always stretching!"

I did the standard Starting Strength and am now doing the Texas Method for my lifting regimen. I train similarly to you (MWF weights / T/R Rball). I haven't been playing weekends lately due to kid duties.  In my opinion, you don't need to do anything special. Just getting your body stronger with a standard lifting routine is going to help."
AdvancedFitness,2kekxb,big_face_killah,2,Mon Oct 27 15:19:38 2014 UTC,"Ok. Here goes my best shot. I play some tennis and squash but not too much Rball.   To me, racquetball sounds like a very asymmetrical sport, meaning a lot of it involves lunging off a particular leg. With that in mind you should aim your training to be also unilateral. ie performing lunges, split squats, single leg deadlifts, KB presses (overhead), DB rows, DB bench etc. This has two main benefits: 1) working on balancing your asymmetries generated by your sport 2) encourages secondary stabilizer muscles during the exercises (ie hip stabilizers during a split squat). Which is key since your sport involves so much single leg lunging and pushing off.  I'm going to assume that quickness is also important to being a good racquetball player. So, I'm going to recommend some plyometric exercises (some of these can be single leg as well). There are many sources for plyometrics, I've used the Vertical Jump Bible as a reference before and recommend it. Its also a free pdf. Some examples are: jump squats, explosive squats, single leg hops, alternate lunge hops, lateral single leg hops. A lot of these movements will mimic functional movements of your sport and help develop skill in performing those movements.  Ultimate frisbee (my main sport) has similar training needs, and this guy Tim Morrill has been developing a system of training that is highly single leg based and explosive. A lot of it (likely not the linear running work) will apply to racquet sports too. Check his stuff out.   //Should I lift heavy or light or a combination?   Lift heavy and work with explosive and plyometric exercises. The idea is to increase your strength and quickness.   Keep doing the HIIT you are doing that's great.  You are in the gym three times a week. Listen to your body but I'd say you could be doing full body workouts every time. You don't need to completely waste yourself every session because you have to compete in your sport the next day and your goal is not hypertrophy.  Also, you are going to want to work in some mobility, movement prep, and core work into your workouts/life. I've been liking Mark Verstegen's book Core Performance for this stuff.

This depends on how well your brain can actually recruit the muscle fibers, and it is called neuromuscular efficiency. Part of getting stronger is increasing neuromuscular efficiency and moving that real world max closer to the true muscular max.  Beginners are not very efficient, so the weight they are lifting during a max attempt isn't anywhere close to what their body is capable of.

So, it might be more / worse, depending on how you're looking at it.

AdvancedFitness,2kaan4,jokerbot,4,Sun Oct 26 19:13:57 2014 UTC,"Something to consider is that all maxes aren't the same.  If you electrically stimulate a muscle, you can make it contract to its full potential.  That doesn't happen naturally, so there's a gap between a muscle's potential and usable max.  This is relevant to your question because the gap between your potential and actual max shrinks with training.  To answer your question, if the strength difference is due to training, the stronger person's max is harder.  A simplistic way of thinking of it is that training teaches you how to work hard.  Untrained people may have the motivation to try hard, but just don't have the experience to exert themselves as much as trained people do.  Edit - I didn't assume full muscle activation because I think that's key to answering your question."
AdvancedFitness,2kaan4,NateThomas1979,3,Sun Oct 26 19:33:36 2014 UTC,"Look up terms such as RPE, Cross section of muscle fibers, force curve, etc.  Those three would be the top of my list of concepts that you're trying to figure out here.   Essentially what you are asking is ""Is a weak person's 100% effort the same as a strong person's 100% effort?""  In the context you provided, yes. If you are truly utilizing all 100% of your muscle fibers then no matter how strong of tissue, you're still using 100%. Effort is not the same as output. When a child pushes with all his/her might on a box that won't move, they are still exerting themselves as hard as they can. The fact that the box only weighs 20 pounds is immaterial. The effort is 100%.  The only other concept I could possibly point you to is the concept of specificity and individuality. Specificity in exercise is the idea that training a muscle group gets benefit to that specific muscle group. It's the idea that you're going to feel pain where you train. Individuality is exactly what you are talking about. We push individuals in exercise and fitness at the degree in which they are going to see effects. So an untrained, sedentary individual would not be starting an exercise program at 80-95% 1RM, but is suggested to start at 50-60% 1RM on their weights until the neural pathways have been trained and the form is solid."

Pullups/pushups to failure also feels subjectively easier, despite getting 3x as many before failing.  In that sense, I'd say as you get stronger, the perceived effort to hit your max goes down."
AdvancedFitness,2kaan4,keepingmyanonymity,0,Sun Oct 26 04:13:15 2014 UTC,"Perception of pain is a difficult thing to measure using objective parameters.  Yes it is true that both lifters will undergo muscular hypertrophy if they are lifting 80%-95% of their rep maximum for 8-12 reps at 3-5 sets. However the stronger man can handle more pain and is taxing his body more than the weak man because the strong man's body has adapted to greater levels of exertion through most likely years of progressive overload.  If I understood your post correctly, then I think you might be wondering ""Does it feel the same for a weak guy to bench the bar and a strong guy to bench 300?"" This is dependent on both individuals' tolerance for pain, which is something that you cannot disregard because it is this tolerance for pain which can be a determinant for gains. Pain is transmitted to the central nervous system (CNS) by receptors called nociceptors. Nociceptors are tonic receptors, which means that they transmit pain to the CNS for as long as the stimulus lasts. The stimulus of a bar is much lower than the stimulus of a 300lb bench, which means that the stronger person can handle a greater stimulus.  Power is also measured in terms of the amount of force you can produce in a given amount of time. Some guys who weigh 135 can produce a lot of power with greater speed of contraction, but the amount of force generated by a person who is heavier (and most likely lifting a lot more weight) is greater. Thus, I submit to you that objectively speaking from what we can measure: the strong man can handle more pain and taxation but it is impossible to know whether or not both of them will ""feel"" the same level of pain and taxation at 80-95% of their RM.   I hope this helped clarify, regardless: hit the gym bro. Strong guys didn't start out strong guys, they became strong guys by working hard and not giving up."

My intention was not to claim that the ability to tolerate pain is a direct indicator that someone will build more muscle. Performing the necessary number of repetitions at appropriate proportions of your maximal strength while maintaining a caloric surplus with proper nutrient intake will ensure hypertrophy.  It is true that someone who can bench press 300 lbs is less likely to feel pain when doing 15 reps on just the bar as opposed to an individual whose 80% RM is the bar. I thought OP was asking whether or not a weaker individual would ""feel"" the same amount of pain as a strong individual if they were both working at 80% of their RM.   Scientifically speaking we can measure what you can push and pull but it is more difficult for us to assess your pain levels without using pain-rating scales. An example of that kind of subjective information would be getting a flu shot. It might feel like a 4/10 for one person but a 2/10 for another person even though the same type of needle used in both instances.  Theoretically speaking (I apologize because I do not have the literature to back this up, it was simply a thought experiment I conceived based on OP's statement) if there are two 155 lbs males both ages 22 with the same body fat percentage and relative strength and we asked each one to perform a set to failure on a 170 lb bench press: It follows that the individual who is able to perform more reps is more likely than not able to tolerate pain greater than the other on the basis that his nociceptors could be activated later on in the set. This could be because of slight variations the nervous sensitivity in both individuals, the sensitivity of the nociceptors, and any potential comorbidities (maybe one of them has nerve damage, who knows?). Granted this is a thought experiment and not a full fledged study. There are a plethora of confounding variables that could alter the manner in which the data is interpreted.  Sorry for the lack of source, these were simply musings I had based on my current set of knowledge.

""Conversely, the development of LIEE in sports that rely on anaerobic energy supply(e.g., weightlifting, sprinting, American football, ice hockey, volleyball) can result inseveral maladaptations that reduce the athlete’s performance capacity (45). WhenLIEE is used to improve endurance in athletes who participate in sports that relypredominantly on anaerobic energy supply, marked decreases in power-generatingcapacity are noted and performance usually is impaired (42, 45, 63, 83). One reasonthat has been proposed to explain this impaired anaerobic performance is that thedevelopment of LIEE can reduce the athlete’s ability to produce force in the highvelocity,low-frequency region of the force–velocity curve (12). Changes to this regionof the force–velocity curve can interfere with the athlete’s ability to develop explosivestrength, which is required by many anaerobic activities (45). In particular, the abilityto achieve high rates of force development and to generate high levels of peak force canbe impaired by the implementation of an LIEE regime (figure 11.1). There also appearsto be a fiber type shift resulting in a decrease in the number of Type II muscle fibers and an increase in Type I fibers when LIEE is the focus of the endurance development program. LIEE training an alsoimpede muscular growth (108), whichwill impair an athlete’s ability to generatehigh rates of force development (81),maximize peak force-generating capacity(81), and optimize peak power generation(45).

AdvancedFitness,2k6vup,broscientologist,18,Fri Oct 24 13:44:57 2014 UTC,"My understanding, in lay terms, without even trying to cite sources, is that in your development years, if you add extra fat cells as a result of the existing ones reaching maximum size, then, indeed those cells are with you for life and the only way of eliminating them is through surgery eg liposuction. However, it is possible to shrink those cells to insignificance by losing the fat reserves they contain.  Some people, I understand, believe that process makes you more vulnerable to repeatedly regaining excess weight as a mature adult, simply because the cells are there to be exploited by any excess calorie consumption, like empty gas tanks. That is maybe why such a fuss is made especially about childhood and adolescent obesity."
AdvancedFitness,2k6vup,Vu70n0m0v5,32,Fri Oct 24 12:53:17 2014 UTC,"That's sort of a half truth, all cells have turnover (degradation of the cell and synthesis to create new cells) and at different rates. Some cells like cardiac cells have a very low turnover rate (measured in years) and some cells like those of the intestinal epithelium are measured in hours.  Adipocytes are relatively slow in turning over (so they're not going away anytime soon despite eventually doing so) and with prolonged dietary changes synthesis can be less than degradation resulting in loss of total adipocytes. It would be technically incorrect to claim they are 'there forever' because such an aberration is just straight up cancerous.  I call it a half truth rather than a lie because when you lose weight and the adipocytes still live they do indeed have some endocrine functions that can impair the weight loss process a bit. Some psychoactive effects (hunger promotion) and you're more likely to store fat in depleted cells that exist rather than needing to synthesize more.   It also isn't really a halftruth that is overly concerning aside from the fatalism attached to it, as it encourages people to focus more on their diets for the long term. :)"

There is nothing that is going to kill WAT as fast as you can lose weight, but it seems probably that over time with a good diet you could reduce WAT count to pre-obesity levels, particularly is there is any validity to the claims that higher temperature cold exposure (~50F) produced apoptosis (this seems to be trendy in the Paleo community).  Another recent study (posted on this sub IIRC, came out this month) indicates that cold exposure produces significant changes in metabolic signaling, both increasing rate of lipid oxidation in WAT and BAT, and increasing mitochondrial synthesis and shifting from a glycogen-based to an oxidation-based energy preference.

AdvancedFitness,2k6vup,xtlou,1 point,Fri Oct 24 20:10:23 2014 UTC,"The loose skin is solely down to the fact that the skin gets stretched to accommodate the extra fat cells and their ever-increasing size. Once the size of the fat cells is reduced the skin is left loose because it can never recover to it's original lesser size before the weight gain. This effect is more pronounced the older you are because we all, fat or skinny, lose skin elasticity as we age.  The weight loss you achieve is never a waste because it will save your life and improve the quality of your life no end. The skin problem is merely a question of aesthetics unless the weight loss has been gargantuan in which case it can cause medical problems. You are unlikely to fall into that category.  The thing to remember is that the vast majority of people who lose a lot of weight usually put it back on again, with interest, pretty soon after. Trying to avoid that is an even bigger challenge than losing the actual excess weight in the first place. The cause of that has nothing to do with fat cells and their biological action but everything to do why we eat excessively, ie the same reasons why we put the weight on in the first place. It's first and foremostly, with notable medical exceptions such as PCOS, hypothyroidism or Praeder-Willi syndrome, a psychological issue."

AdvancedFitness,2k6ew5,bogeyegod,1 point,Wed Oct 29 15:41:22 2014 UTC,"Nope. I mean, it could somewhat increase free radical prod through peroxidation, but it's doubtful for a couple of reasons. Fasting increases mitochondrial UCP expression, which amongst other things, reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Also, as mentioned by bogey, glucose causes more free radical prod as there's a higher ratio of NADH:FADH2, which favors complex 1 & 3, the main sites of ROS generation.   As you also see from that link on mitohormesis, mild levels of ROS is actually a positive event for the generation of increased stress resistance. The ROS stimulates many avenues, mainly the cardinal player NRF2.  A very layman explanation for those factors: NRF2 is a master player in upregulating endogenous antioxidant activity. It stimulates a vast plethora of genes, upregulates most all antioxidant defenses in the body, it's involved in the protection from most anything. It's really a hugely beneficial player.  FoxO also upregulates many antioxidant genes and is involved in general cellular protection. For instance, in damaged cells, it will induce apoptosis to try to mitigate cancerous growth. It will however also aim to stimulate DNA repair, so it generally tries to repair you, though it's also catabolic via upregulating MAFbx signaling in skeletal muscle. To be honest, unless you fasted for a significant time or were on a very large deficit, I don't think that's much to worry about.  Sirt1/3 are generally protective as well. They block HIF-1 alpha expression that inherently occurs through aging, promoting increasing mitochondrial-nuclear communication, they upregulate PGC-1 alpha, inhibit axonal caspase activation, protect pancreatic beta cells, regulates your circadian rhythm at the level of the SCN (central regulator), etc etc again. Many roles, but here's a few.  AMPK inhibits lipid & cholesterol synthesis, promotes insulin-independent glucose uptake, stimulates lipolysis and FFA oxidation, promotes DNA repair or apoptosis if the cell is excessively damaged, increases PGC-1 alpha expression, etc etc again.  Here's at least a decent start to some of these factors, though there's really a multitude of articles on these highly important genes."

Pigs fed a 2% protein feed would eat 5x as much as pigs eating a 10% protein feed.  There is a couple for human studies.  One lipogenesis changes when adding additional carbs to the diet.  They found lipogenesis was unaffected but although more fat was gained and less was burnt.  Pretty much the basis for the keto ""fat adapting"" theories and also theories on eating high carb diets not leading to weight gain.     Another interesting one on protein that found that 5% protein feed with a caloric excess would gain half as much weight (no lean gains) as people with a 10% protein feed.   I would be interested to know what their lifting gains were because I know lifters on low protein diets that look weak but are deceptively strong especially in terms of strength endurance.

You can read a lot of diet industry ""gurus"" try to dismiss research largely because it is old and that we ""learnt"" new things since then.

Although the example in this article is pretty bad because it is when there are large amounts of studies all saying the same thing but they all are manipulating the results with bogus methodologies.  I don't think a single study in a completely irrelevant journal with completely bogus data ever really goes that far  I see a lot of studies do things like having subjects lose weight while eating eggs and then claiming that eggs do not have an impact on cholesterol levels,  But weight loss lowers cholesterol so the study is actually entirely irrelevant."

AdvancedFitness,2jzi4a,ErnestRutherford,13,Wed Oct 22 12:14:28 2014 UTC,"I will try to help here. I'm not sure I understand the question, but that may be because its underpinnings are quite confused.   convention says that an athlete's main goal should be to not lose muscle or significant weight during the season   An athlete's main goal is to perform at optimum ability in the chosen domain. This will dictate whether losing or maintaining 'weight' are appropriate. In instances where the sport itself has a strong capacity to cause loss of lbm (ie endurance sports), then the goal should be to mitigate that. In sports where excessive bulk relative to power output reduces speed or results in lower performance, it may be more important to lose the fat/weight than to hold on to strength.    don't the intense requirements of the typical basketball/football (my sports background) practice create an environment that's arguably as good for building muscle as the weight room?   The difference is progressive overload. An athlete playing a sport such as the ones you list will improve over time--this is an efficiency gain--and the way the athlete's body changes over time can include muscle hypertrophy and strength gains, or strength gains and fat loss, or some other combination therein. The improvement will be in proportion to the exertion of the sport (or the level of the competition) and will tend toward equilibrium. In other words, the gains from playing will reflect the level at which you are playing (and not go beyond) up until a point where individual talent and genetics make a difference. Everyone eventually tops out and requires supplemental training to be competitive.  The weight room is based around the principle of progressive overload, which continually makes equilibrium the enemy. The weight room plan is to continually stress the muscle by continually adding more to its burden. In the context of football, it's like playing an opponent who gets constantly better each game, forcing you to compensate and do the same. This is not to say you can't get a serious improvement from just playing your sport (like a gymnist for example) but that you're likely to hit a performance 'wall' or limitation much faster if you don't do supplemental resistance training.    athletes are so strong without (reportedly) ever having touched weights.   Athletes are strong in proportion to the required exertion of their sport, and their genetic 'talent'.  As to the title of the post, there's a difference between having the required glycogen stores (to power anaerobic performance) and having surplus overall calorie stores. One can stay at TDEE levels but make sure macronutrient ratios are sufficient to optimise glycogen stores, or even to stay in a ketogenic state (to maximise fatty acid oxidation in support of fat loss), refilling muscle glycogen on demand. That's of course totally dependent upon the needs of the sport and its competition frequency. It's also dependent on the athlete's needs and body composition, and any goals involving them.   I hope that helped. Please disregard if this was not what you meant."
AdvancedFitness,2jzi4a,tigerdb2,0,Wed Oct 22 13:56:09 2014 UTC,"You're on the right track, my main issue here is the progressive overload part; I'm suggesting, that maybe because activities like sprinting and jumping are anabolic, they inherently have a progressive overload nature. This is the example I picture in my head: I go to practice, and throughout the course of practice we are bound to have at least a couple times in practice where we have to put in 100% of our effort, maybe for end of practice sprints, or a game sealing block where you have to jump as high as possible. Now, if I were operating at a healthy caloric surplus, wouldn't my legs grow stronger as well as more efficient over time? One similar anecdote I have friends from my time spent playing high school football who never went in the weight room, but some of them actually got bigger stronger, and I'd hypothesize it's because they were eating at a surplus and got the ""progressive overload"" stimulus they needed for growth from the daily blocking work in practices and games. Hope that clarifies."
AdvancedFitness,2jzi4a,Correriander,3,Wed Oct 22 14:56:05 2014 UTC,"The gains you are talking about are 'efficiency gains' not progressive overload gains. To use your analogy, you jump as high as you can each game, and over time the height you can jump increases. That's efficiency. Progressive overload is impossible in this way--you can't force yourself to jump higher than you can jump each week. That, however, is exactly what happens in the weight room--you push yourself to lift more each week (or workout) than you did the week before, and that is the driver for your improvement--adaptation to the additional demand.   If you can understand the difference, then you can understand how your buddies got bigger and stronger in their sport, but in a way limited to their performance level in the sport, and not in a way that would be forced on them in the weightroom."
AdvancedFitness,2jzi4a,minerva330,4,Wed Oct 22 15:01:32 2014 UTC,"To further this, hypertrophy is driven by different mechanisms than nueromuscular efficiency or intra/intermuscular efficiency. Power output can improve without a corresponding increase in muscular size. I guess my bottom line is that the body responds specifically to a specific stimulus. Sprinting/jumping isn't the same stimulus as lifting weights until fatigue, in terms of both duration and magnitude.  The nervous system is a huge component of expressing strength/power."

AdvancedFitness,2jtjev,WBuffet,35,Mon Oct 20 20:47:17 2014 UTC,The TLDR is that the quads and hamstrings experienced greater muscle activation in the belted group without any decrease in spinal erector or external oblique activation.   This is evidence in favor of belted training.
AdvancedFitness,2jtjev,htown_swang,25,Mon Oct 20 20:54:56 2014 UTC,"Depends how you look at it.  If you assume EMG activity acutely can be assumed to correlate strongly with strength gains in those particular muscles over time (which is an assumption a lot of people seem to have, but that's only been directly studied once, to the best of my knowledge.  I wrote about it here:  http://gregnuckols.com/2014/07/18/band-resisted-pushups-bench-press-for-strength-gains-plus-how-useful-is-emg/ and here's the pubmed link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24983847), then you could look at it like this:  Without a belt, rate of strength gain for the ""core"" (abs, obliques, erector spinae, etc.) and for the legs (quads and hamstrings) both equal ""X"" strength per month.  Add a belt, and EMG for the legs increases without a concomitant increase in core EMG readings.  So rate of strength gain for the legs would increase, while rate of strength gain for the core would remain the same.  We could say it's a rate of X for the core still, and a rate of 1.2X for the legs.  So after 6 months of training with a belt vs. beltless, theoretically the strength gains for your core would be 6X, and the strength gains for your legs would be 6X beltless, and 7.2X with a belt.  So while training with a belt wouldn't make your core weaker like a lot of people claim, it could potentially make it weaker relative to your legs.  Now, does that actually matter (or would it actually happen?  Keep in mind this is way beyond what the study covers directly.  Just a thought experiment)?  Who knows."

I have always wondered whether the advice to only use a belt for maximal lifts was based on any type of research or if it was broscience.
AdvancedFitness,2jnafy,ufcarazy,4,Sat Oct 18 23:06:07 2014 UTC,A lot of the studies studying the eccentric portion of the lift show for maximal hypertrophy you want to have a 3-5 second eccentric phase (check out Brad Schoenfelds review of optimal muscle hypertrophy). Studies show that a fast velocity on the eccentric actually produce the most muscular damage but the problem is in real life you have gravity to aide on most eccentrics. So to get the maximal effect on the eccentric portion you have to slow it down or you could potentially let gravity do all the work lol.  One of the reasons why is that on the eccentric you use half as many motor units (counter-intuitive i know). This means that there is more stress per fiber which will create more damage.  For muscle strength/power you want to move it as quickly as possible.  So for muscle gains=3-5 second eccentric Strength=move it quickly  Also a lot of studies on how eccentrics affect remodeling of soft tissues. I rehabbed my torn ucl with controlled eccentrics.
AdvancedFitness,2jnafy,dumbjock25,4,Sun Oct 19 17:06:49 2014 UTC,also if anyone wants me to go into detail let me know. I tried to keep it simple. I was a researcher in this field so I wanted to prevent loading up a post with scientific jargon

AdvancedFitness,2jnafy,dumbjock25,1 point,Sat Oct 25 01:51:38 2014 UTC,"As far as pause work you eliminate the elastic component that will help you do a little more weight. There are conflicting thoughts on this, but if your goal is strength I would not focus on pause reps to increase strength/power. If your goal is hypertrophy the additional time under tension may increase hypertrophy.   To increase strength I would combine strength training with no pause reps and plyometrics/speed reps. An undulating periodization program has been seen as better compared to the old periodization model. An undulating periodization program is a fancy word for change up your goal (hypertrophy, strength, power) frequently, whether it's weekly or daily. Sorry if my grammar is horrible.

AdvancedFitness,2jnafy,dumbjock25,3,Sun Oct 19 17:07:10 2014 UTC,"Not really that important.  Depends on context.  The eccentric if I recall correctly does more damage then isometric or concentric contractions, with damage being one mechanism behind hypertrophy.  You're also stronger on the concentric.  And overtly delayed tempo on the eccentric will reduce potentiation of the stretch reflex for squats/bench press/overhead press.  But this is coupled with the fact that you must remain isometrically tight and a divebombed eccentric, whilst better for the stretch reflex, is inherently dangerous.  And I don't think it matters for hypertrophy.  All that matters is fatigue; any type of contraction fatigues the muscle.  One advantage of slowing tempo down is you are forced to use less weight.  Good for isolation, accessory stuff where you don't care as much about strength and just the pump.  Slow eccentrics are beneficial for connective tissue health and p/rehabing tendinopathy, though"
AdvancedFitness,2jnafy,mrcosmicna,10,Mon Oct 20 00:01:09 2014 UTC,"Not sure if it was a typo or not, but it's actually the eccentric movement that we are stronger on, simply because the actin and myosin cross links just have to release then link the next unit, instead of pulling and linking.

Is there anything special about the eccentric for remodelling non-pathological tendons?  Lastly, I know this is tenuously related, but what about eccentrics are preventing belly tears?  I think there's some stuff on slow eccentric nordic hamstring curl preventing hammy tears"
AdvancedFitness,2jnafy,mrcosmicna,2,Sun Oct 19 09:31:26 2014 UTC,"I'm not aware of any research supporting eccentrics for prevention of tendon rehab. As the main reason for tendon pathology is tissue overload, it would make sense that load management and sufficient recovery times would be very important for prevention of tendon injuries, just like it is for tendon rehab.  Regarding eccentrics for soft tissue injury prevention - I actually just completed a mini systematic review on the use of eccentrics for reducing hamstring injury incidence as part of my Masters studies! There are a few studies out there, but most are terrible quality. The one high quality trial (Petersen et al. 2011) that has been published did show a modest benefit from a 10 week progressive program during preseason, then once per week maintenance during the season for semiprofessional soccer players. A lot of studies had poor results because of all of the dropouts as a result of DOMS from the eccentric exercises"
AdvancedFitness,2jnafy,goatchop41,2,Sun Oct 19 09:40:23 2014 UTC,"I would add the small distinction that the tissue overload (especially in a lifter, most people who subscribe to this sub) isn't just due to erroneous training volume but faulty mechanics.  Something like valgus knees or incorrect elbow alignment when pressing carries obviously a greater risk of injury regardless of volume.  And thank you for your overview.  Your masters topic sounds really interesting.  Yes, eccentrics are bad because of the DOMS.  One of the reasons not to vary training programs, especially for in-season athletes.  Just keep the program the same and increase training effect via progressive overload in lieu of exercise variation (because I understand repeated bout effect doesn't kick in if exercises are varied?) and stay consistent.    I would engage more constructively in this because tendon pathology is of particular interest for me, but I really should be studying...  I'll come back to this in the future, though."
AdvancedFitness,2jnafy,mrcosmicna,1 point,Tue Oct 21 02:04:01 2014 UTC,"Slow eccentrics are beneficial for connective tissue health and p/rehabing tendinopathy, though   Does anyone know why this is so? I don't really understand why eccentrics should help, I mean, tension is tension when it comes to connective tissue, right? It's not like muscle because there's no real contractile component.  Is it just that you get more time under tension to stimulate remodelling? You can generate more tension than with a concentric contraction? Is it just that eccentrics kinda suck, so it influences pain perception?  My previous research into the literature turned up a lot of ""seems to work, dunno why"" kind of answers."
AdvancedFitness,2jnafy,Wafflecone416,2,Tue Oct 21 10:28:13 2014 UTC,"Well we are stronger during eccentrics which you already know I'm sure, so that means we can increase the load on the tendon even further if you only do the eccentric portion.  Then the reason for only eccentrics is because doing both the eccentric and concentric portion of an exercise fatigues the muscle more quickly, and that would reduce the amount of time the tendon was under load.   So doing only the eccentric portion allows you to increase the load on the tendon and decrease the rate of the fatigue for the affected muscles, which allows you to load the tendon for longer periods of time. Both of those factors are supposed to help the remodeling process."
AdvancedFitness,2jnafy,Vontom,1 point,Sun Oct 19 10:10:57 2014 UTC,Eccentric-only training may lead to slightly greater hypertrophy than concentric-only training. Individuals seeking hypertrophy should make use of eccentric muscle actions in their programming to maximize increases in muscular size.   http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/2014/02/19/eccentric-or-concentric/  Although I do remember reading that slowing the movement artificially had no greater effect on muscle gain compared to simply controlling the negative

It's far optimal for hypertrophy.. you are after all trying to stress the muscle and not simply lift the weight by any means (assuming hypertrophy is the goal). It's important for strength training, yes, but not as important as it is for hyp training.. for strength training, lifting with maximal speed/force is ideal for strength production."

As more time elapses since your last meal, you rely progressively more on fat oxidation. Muscle catabolism also goes up, since even though overall reliance on glucose decreases, the contribution of glycogenolysis (where you tap into existing glucose stores) decreases more, so gluconeogenesis (the manufacturing of glucose from amino acids) is ramped up to compensate.  For the effect of activity on fuel selection, read this: http://www.exrx.net/Nutrition/Substrates.html"
AdvancedFitness,2jczjx,truefelt,3,Wed Oct 15 23:25:44 2014 UTC,"As more time elapses since your last meal, you rely progressively more on fat oxidation.   That's interesting, I had always been told that the longer you went without a meal, the more your body would break down muscle for energy."
AdvancedFitness,2jczjx,Ballaticianaire,13,Thu Oct 16 00:39:22 2014 UTC,"It does, as he said, via gluconeogenesis. That's the distinction. The amino acid pool will be directed to the liver to regulate blood glucose levels, whereas the propensity toward fatty acid oxidation supplies the bulk of pure ATP and bodily function. For instance, during fasting, up to like 60+ hours, growth hormone has a substantial rise, this is to increase lipolysis and FFA oxidation and also to spare as much muscle tissue/amino acid as possible. During fasting you'll also see a rise in sympathetic tone and glucagon circulation, releasing more FFAs, ramping up FFA oxidation further, and upregulating gluconeogenesis. Even further, and where catabolism begins to set in, during fasting cortisol has a very robust increase, further increasing lipolysis & FFA oxidation as well as gluconeogenesis. As fasting continues as well, you have even more catabolism via FoxO signaling, which also happens to upregulate gluconeogenesis via a PGC-1 alpha interaction.   Thus, there really is a time effect. It relies on both heavily.. during the first 12+ hours after a meal, it's mostly FFA oxidation and glycogen stores contributing to the blood glucose pool regulation. After 16 hours there's a marked increased reliance on AAs for glucose regulation, and as that goes on, that increases, with the concomitant increase in the various other factors. GH aims to mitigate the catabolism, but as time goes on, the other factors rise too much and have too significant of an effect. Even despite a massive reliance on the AA pool after some time (easily >24hrs), however, FFA oxidation will still play a cardinal role, that is until the bf % drops to considerably low level."

AdvancedFitness,2jczjx,Snooglemunch,10,Thu Oct 16 03:47:05 2014 UTC,"It's not an on–off switch. The liver is actually kind of thrifty in releasing its stored glycogen; it's not like you use up the stores first and only then tap into amino acids. No, as soon as you're in the postabsorptive state, there's going to be some net flux of amino acids out of your tissues. In and of itself this is nothing to worry about, but there will be a point where the subsequent meal is unable to compensate for the accrued protein losses, and you end up with a net loss of lean tissue.  Here's a study with some good data on the rate of gluconeogenesis vs. glycogen breakdown: Gluconeogenesis and the Cori cycle in 12-, 20-, and 40-h-fasted humans.   At 12, 20, and 40 h of fasting, respectively, blood glucose was 93 ± 2, 83 ± 2, and 71 ± 2 (SE) mg/dl; glucose production was 2.3, 1.8, and 1.77 mg ⋅ kg−1 ⋅ min−1; the recycling of labeled carbon was 8, 15, and 15%, and that of glucose molecules (Cori cycle) was 18, 35, and 36%; the contribution of gluconeogenesis to glucose production was 41, 71, and 92%.   So, already at the 12-hour mark, 41% of the glucose released by the liver was derived from gluconeogenesis (as opposed to stored glycogen).  However, this doesn't mean it all comes from tissue protein. If I understand the Cori cycle data correctly, only 41%−18%=23% of total glucose production actually represented newly created glucose (someone please tell me if I've got this wrong). Glycerol from lipolysis also provides a minor contribution (AFAIK ~25% of GNG)."

Such a move is another attempt to be muscle sparing--rather than just powering the fasted body with aminos broken and transformed into glucose substrates, it can also provide the necessary fuels by breaking endogenous fat into acetyl-CoA and finally into ketones.  Forgive me if you covered this from a different angle--I just wanted to let OP know that it's not just muscle that goes after a long enough fast--that the body has a back-up source to power the body with its own fat."

A correlation was found for 4E-BP1 though. It's also a substrate of mTOR, it's phosphorylation inhibits it and allows the translation initiation factor, eIF4, which allows protein synthesis itself to initiate/start.   I suspect perhaps there's other factors that allow proper biogenesis of ribosome complexes, making that distinct factor less important than the initiation of the translation itself.. though I'm not sure, perhaps someone else can shed light on other factors involved there specifically."
AdvancedFitness,2jcfci,DieMafia,1 point,Thu Oct 16 20:57:03 2014 UTC,Why is it that some people lost muscle volume while training?
AdvancedFitness,2j8y4f,JSCMI,4,Tue Oct 14 20:07:51 2014 UTC,"This question implies that there is an optimal level of exertion or %1RM intensity which optimizes training results.   There a number of problems with this approach:   As you pointed out, goals differ.  Training level matters as well. Rank beginners can progress extremely quickly working near maximal intensity. As they advance, progress requires introducing workouts with sub-max intensity. Many advanced lifters report progress is only possible with PB attempts spaced weeks apart, and true 1RM testing avoided for 3+ months at a time. So the ""best"" approach depends Sets/reps alone is not sufficient to design a lifting protocol, as is the ""the three types of rep ranges (strength, hypertrophy, and endurance)."" Mass is largely driven by volume, which is efficient to train with rep ranges usually cited as appropriate for hypertrophy. Max strength requires training with maximal force, which requires weights that can only be used in the rep ranges usually cited as appropriate for strength. But what kind of mass progress is made with the ""strength rep range"" when the volume is equated to ""hypertrophy ranges""? It turns out they are pretty similar. The drawback is that working exclusively with weights in that high a range requires long rests which can make for an impractically long workout. It is also more difficult to tolerate.  Tying (2) and (3) together a bit, when training that is sufficient to stimulate growth/progress in a non-beginner lifter recovery becomes an issue. This happens at different stages of advancement depending on the lifter, but at some point there needs to be more time for recovery. A popular approach is to periodize how heavy the work is: e.g. after particularly heavy training to stimulate progress, training weights are reduced for a growth and recovery period. This can be as simple as a weekly Madcow 1x5 approach or far more complicated periodization schemes. Deloads play in here too, but I'm not aware of any clinical research on them (Brad Schoenfeld is probably a fair practical expert on the subject and recommends starting by looking at deloads after roughly 3 weeks as a starting point. He seems to think most people would benefit in progress from taking them more often than they ""need"" for injury reasons) Building on (4) the best rep range in trained lifters is, quite simply, the one you haven't done lately. If you've been working with weights no heavier than you can lift for 6-10 reps, you'll probably benefit from some heavy doubles or triples. If you've been working near your 1RM for a while, backing off on intensity could be very beneficial both in terms of recovery as well as adding more volume.    EVIDENCE-BASED RESISTANCE TRAINING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MUSCULAR HYPERTROPHY  Recent comments by Layne Norton ""If you're looking for the perfect rep scheme or whatever it is, you're going to be very disappointed by this...."" (comment here)  Recent AF thread with more research/discussion  Unfortunately, none of this spells out precisely how heavy you should be going how often. In fact, research has demonstrated that similarly advanced trainees can even see faster progress with conflicting rep progressions. Some lifters progress faster focusing on 3-rep sets, other son 5-rep sets. Likely both schemes would be inferior to periodized progress past a certain point, but should they work up to sets like 5/3/1? Or would they benefit more from working up to 7/5/3 rep maxes? Or does that vary by individual as well?   Ultimately, you've got to study what the trends seem to be, identify the variables that tend to matter, identify the approaches that tend to work, and then experiment to find what works for you individually. Track your workouts meticulously. Give programs real time to work. Don't neglect other factors and how they may contribute to (or prevent) progress. E.g. if you have seasonal allergies and sleep like crap in the spring, don't compare the results directly to another time when your sleep was fantastic.   But the research seems to be identifying progress in volume, more than anything else, as a driving factor in muscle mass and finding that it may actually take very few sets/reps near our 1RM to maximize how efficiently we can utilize that mass to maximize both strength and hypertrophy progress with surprisingly similar training protocols."

AdvancedFitness,2j8y4f,StickyFruit,1 point,Thu Oct 16 12:17:02 2014 UTC,Oh ok that's what I thought! Haha no problem.  Have you found any intermediate / advanced programs that adhere to these principles more closely than others? I've watched Layne's videos on nonlinear periodization and daily undulating periodization but have had trouble coming up with my own program.
AdvancedFitness,2j8y4f,JSCMI,3,Thu Oct 16 17:46:00 2014 UTC,"Layne Norton makes some excellent points on a lot of aspects of training. He'll be the first guy to tell you to give Mike Zourdos a look-up (did an AF AMA here).   Layne designed PHAT around Dr Zourdos' work. A problem with PHAT is that it leaves a lot of the details about progression and weight selection to the trainee, which is precisely what most people are overdoing. Most implementations are also equipment heavy which is a complication for a home gym guy like me (but if you're interested anyway, check out PHUL too).  GZCL's method and Candito's programs both do a good job of periodizing high intensity sets along with volume.   I'm also a fan of 5/3/1 BBB. The variety I do might be called ""less boring"" and you do 3 ""work sets"" (most of which are well below your true 1RM) and then you do 5 sets of 10 for volume (or 5x8 or 8x3 or whatever suits your fancy) on an upper/lower split. Monday=heavy OHP and 5x10 bench, Tuesday=heavy DL and 5x10 squat, then Thurs/Fri reverses the lifts so Thursday=heavy bench/5x10 OHP and Friday=heavy squat/5x10 deadlifts.   5/3/1 is definitely the least of the 3 in terms of time spent working near your 1RM. That seems to be something that agrees with me. Your mileage may vary. None of these programs are inherently better for everyone and you really have to try put in 6-12 months trying them out before you can really compare them. Finding what works for you is not a quick process.  Anyway, 5/3/1's ""work sets"" are all based on a specific and pre-determined % of a ""training max"" (though there are a few schemes, and the author admits different folks may need tweaks). The training max is meant to be below your true 1RM. Experts in training such as Brad Schoenfeld often cite too much work too close to true 1RM as the #1 training mistake. 5/3/1 compels you to start with a conservative max and then typically work below that, and to NOT bump up your training max to your new 1RM as it increases. Remember, it's not about constant high intensity. It's about volume. You want to lift heavy-for-you but if you're lifting to failure 4 times a week you're almost certainly overdoing it (at least as a natural lifter who's not a genetic outlier).  Since a spreadsheet to manage all the %1RM sets is almost required, this makes it easy to manipulate the 5x10 / BBB sets as another % of your 1RM. Your best bet is to start ""too low"", like 30%, and then work up from there.   Since you've got a sheet going anyway, tracking volume is a snap. Just make a new tab for each training cycle and have a ""Progress"" tab at the front for easy reference over time.   Of course, you could do the exact same thing to track volume over time with PHAT or lots of other approaches. There's lots of good ways to do this, the idea is to find a program that fits your goals, available equipment, your personal preference for how determined you want your heavy sets be, and so on.   Anecdotally, I can't vouch strongly enough for how counter-productive it is to try to set new 1-3 rep max PR's all the time. As rank beginners many of us only grudgingly accept programs that insist it's not optimal to work muscles every day and that it's not optimal to start as heavy as you can possibly handle. Yet somehow it's easy to forget this 6 months and 2-3 plates later.  I've seen a real revival in my own training results (in terms of strength & hypertrophy progress but also psychologically) this fall after finally giving in and knocking 10-20% off most of my training maxes. It doesn't seem intuitively possible that taking that much weight off your squat & deadlift could result in faster progress (even if you need to give your joints a break) and yet that's exactly what happened. Maybe Schoenfeld, Wendler, etc are onto something when they say the #1 training mistake people make is doing more heavy work than is optimal.   I think we're going to be hearing a lot more about programming volume in the next few years. Specifically, there will be stronger recommendations for trainees of every level to track their volume over time and I think examination of benefits to deloading/cycling volume is going to be an emerging area of research, albeit another difficult one."
AdvancedFitness,2j8y4f,StickyFruit,1 point,Thu Oct 16 20:19:09 2014 UTC,"First of all let me thank you for such a long and detailed response, I really appreciate it. I actually have a few questions to follow up with if you don't mind! You seem to be a wealth of knowledge, and very familiar with the body of research regarding training plus anecdotal evidence. I could discuss training programming endlessly, I spend a lot of time tinkering around with programming in my head during the day.   I've been training for a little more than a year and half. I started out briefly with Stronglifts 5x5, then quickly transitioned to Greyskull LP because I saw it as a superior beginner's program. Towards the end of my linear gains on Greyskull, I decided to cut some weight and did a high intensity low-rep scheme program (RPT). Recently, I decided to bulk again and have been doing a modified Wednler's 5/3/1 BBB like you mentioned, alternating the BBB lifts so that the frequency of the main lifts is 2x week. So for example, monday I bench 531 and overhead press BBB. My current 1 rep maxes via http://www.strstd.com/ are a 215 lb bench, 290 lb squat, 330 lb deadlift, and 125 lb overhead press.   Edit: Will post follow up / questions in another comment  : )"
AdvancedFitness,2j8y4f,TunaBoo,4,Sat Oct 18 19:03:17 2014 UTC,"Lot of infos on this... but your literal question is ""What is the point of diminishing returns""  I suspect that is rep #2. Rep #1 has the most gain, then rep 2 is a little bit less, etc. Now this assumes that your weight is heavy enough to cause a breakdown of muscle tissue...  Really what you want to know, is how much should average guy workout to get reasonably strong in a reasonable amount of gym time? I have seen progress on 2 days a week, maybe 4 sets of 5 reps per exercise per workout. Did I get more progress with 4 days? Yes. Did I get more progress with 4-5 more backoff sets? Yes. But as a new guy, you just want to be making SOME progress. Follow SS or Stronglifts and you will get stronger. You can even get away with doing a little less."
AdvancedFitness,2j8y4f,Dj3086,2,Tue Oct 14 20:14:33 2014 UTC,"That's kind've opposite.. So basically you're saying, just do one really heavy squat for each set. Growth isn't triggered until the muscle is exhausted. Look at bodybuilding workouts. They do triple drop sets.. The growth isn't triggered until the muscle is exhausted"
AdvancedFitness,2j8y4f,TunaBoo,5,Tue Oct 14 20:33:04 2014 UTC,"I am not saying thats the BEST way to grow muscles. I am saying that is the point of diminishing returns.   So say 2 guys can both squat 100lbs for 1 rep. Guy A goes to the gym and does 1 100 pound squat. Guy B guys to the gym and does 2 95 pound squats.  Do that with increases over 6 months.. guy A can now squat 160 pounds. Guy B can now squat 180 pounds.  yes guy B can squat MORE. But there were DIMINISHING returns. The first squat added 60 pounds over 6 months to 1RM. The second squat added 20 pounds.  To repeat. The best way to get strong is NOT to do 1 squat. But, 1 squat is very likely the point of diminishing returns. Very different concepts."

AdvancedFitness,2j8y4f,Ballaticianaire,3,Tue Oct 14 21:09:21 2014 UTC,"As far as diminishing return goes its a pretty pointless measure since probably anything after the first few reps would have diminishing benefit per increased rep.   Anyways like a lot of folks have said a lot of times, it depends on your body, some people respond better to low reps, high frequency and some to high volume, low frequency, or any mixture of these.  You won't know until you've tried different things for a few months.  This isn't really an ./r/advancedfitness question anyways."
AdvancedFitness,2j8y4f,SlayerSBoxxy,1 point,Tue Oct 14 20:48:33 2014 UTC,"There's no absolute way to define this. It's governed by idiosyncrasies. For instance, it's pretty unequivocal that high volume is optimal for hypertrophy. With that said, there's a difference in ""high volume"" for a beginner vs an advanced lifter.. and even then between two different advanced lifters. So, no, there's no way to definitely say anything about this."

AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,dasmountain,1 point,Sat Oct 11 12:37:55 2014 UTC,I have one of those wacky QL / low back issues. Got any ideas on how can I fix it?
AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,HeinrichNutslinger,3,Sat Oct 11 22:46:16 2014 UTC,A lot of the time the QL can become overactive because the glute med isn't firing correctly and it takes over the role as a stabilizer. Try doing some low level glute med work like clamshells and monster walks and see if it helps. Also to some abdominal bracing exercises like curl-ups and side planks if they don't increase pain. Another exercise like bird dogs may also help glute recruitment with ab stabilization.
AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,dasmountain,2,Sun Oct 12 01:53:36 2014 UTC,"Traditional clamshells (in ~45° of hip flexion) won't help with a weak glute med because it will just encourage TFL substitution. Needs to be done with a neutral hip. Anyway, it would be more effective to do hip abduction in side lying or standing with resistance if you're trying to target glute med - it's a much stronger abductor than external rotator"

Too much strain on the TFL can cause ITB issues. The TFL works more when the hip is flexed, vs the hip being in neutral, when the glute med is the primary mover."
AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,zortnarftroz,2,Sat Oct 11 14:11:38 2014 UTC,"The glute med also works to stabilize the hips in a coronal plane (left-right), which is why it's important in ambulation.

By putting that heel prop under them, you move their centre of gravity slightly posteriorly (that's good for squatting, you want your weight on your heels), it encourages more quads loading and activation with less hip flexion in the initial phases (and therefore less chance of lumbar flexion compensating it'll the hips are a bit crap).

Keep at it but go only as low as you can without rounding.  And, full disclosure: I use squat shoes when I squat high-bar.

AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,anactivegrenade,4,Tue Oct 14 01:03:23 2014 UTC,"Tight pecs, weak/inhibited trapezius.  One example - a friend of mine works in graphic design and is stuck at the desk a lot. We all know what this means: rounded shoulders. One day he joins me for a workout, does some push-ups to warm up, and I shit you not, his scapulae were protracted and static for the entire movement. Literally fixed in one place.  Also, with the prominence of ""exercising gurus"" and ne'er-do-well PTs using the cue ""shoulders down and back"" for any lift or situation, including rows, OHP, deadlift, bench, etc., has lead to rhomboid dominance and an inhibition of the serratus anterior and lower traps for a lot of folks."
AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,goatchop41,1 point,Sat Oct 11 20:03:26 2014 UTC,"I'd disagree with the assertion that it would inhibit the lower trap - check the anatomy, LT depresses and downwardly rotates the scan, so it definitely wouldn't be inhibited by that movement occurring! I actually don't understand where the train of thought regarding LT being inhibited in shoulder issues originated, because it doesn't make sense when we consider how the scap sits in a lot of dysfunctional shoulders"
AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,anactivegrenade,1 point,Thu Oct 16 02:54:30 2014 UTC,"The lower trapezius actually UPWARDLY rotates the scapula. Just look at where it inserts - the spine of the scapula. An isolated contraction would most definitely upwardly rotate (and retract it).  Rhomboids retract and downwardly rotate the scapula. So when your shoulders are always ""down and back"", the rhomboids take over, and upward rotation is inhibited, thus increasing the likelihood of impingement during overhead movements.   because it doesn't make sense when we consider how the scap sits in a lot of dysfunctional shoulders   This is completely individual, and there are numerous types of ""dysfunctional shoulders."" Have a read - http://robertsontrainingsystems.com/blog/is-scapular-stability-a-myth/"
AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,goatchop41,1 point,Thu Oct 16 04:21:51 2014 UTC,"1) it upwardly rotates the scap when activating in synergy with the rest of the trapezius. In isolation, it would not.  2) I appreciate your candour regarding the different types of shoulder issues. I would point out that Mike Robertson is a trainer, albeit a very experienced one. He is a higher caliber trainer, but I will stick with the shoulder related knowledge that I have learnt from Lyn Watson, who is one of the more highly regarded specialist shoulder physios in Australia (and internationally). Evidence that she presents in her courses focuses much less on the lower trap and implicates weakness of the upper traps, which is the primary upward rotator of the scap - sorting out good upward and lateral rotation with movement solves a large proportion of impingement and instability presentations"
AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,feddau,1 point,Thu Oct 16 06:04:21 2014 UTC,"Given how it inserts onto the scapula, how would an an isolated contraction of the lower trap NOT upwardly rotate it? But because it is impossible to truly isolate the LT, I believe this is a moot point. You are correct that other muscles contribute (upper trap, serratus). True, he's only a strength coach, not a PT. Given his advanced training in biomechanics and rehab (despite him being only a coach), his knowledge is certainly valuable. I feel the same way about Cressey.   But this whole discussion on restoring scapular upward rotation to prevent shoulder dysfunction.. aren't we agreeing on the same thing here? You say upward rotation and lateral rotation (which I assume means abduction/protraction)... by NOT forcing the shoulders down and back when the shoulders should move oppositely, you usually allow UR/Prot. to occur, which solves the issue.  If there is a dysfunction where there's chronic inhibition of the LT/UT/serratus and chronic over-use of the rhomboids/lats, then specific exercises and stretches are needed. I feel like we are, again, agreeing on the same thing here."
AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,anactivegrenade,2,Thu Oct 16 13:30:18 2014 UTC,"Definitely, in principle we are in agreement! Where I am voicing dissent is regarding the proposed inhibition of LT. I'm glad though that there has been no mention of 'overactive/tight' upper traps"
AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,feddau,1 point,Fri Oct 17 00:07:32 2014 UTC,"They kinda need to be back and down to help maintain a stable thorax during most of those movements. Are you arguing that, or are you just pointing out the rhomboid dominance and need for some free scap movements in most meathead programming?"
AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,anactivegrenade,3,Sat Oct 11 21:43:23 2014 UTC,"They kinda need to be back and down to help maintain a stable thorax during most of those movements.   I guess if their upper backs are so weak and they have little mind-muscle connection or proprioception, then they revert to using the scapular retractors to help stabilize the thorax.  But, realize that the strongest extensors of the upper back are the erectors, and the traps are a relatively weak thoracic extensor. If retracting the scapula were necessary to stabilize the upper back against flexion, that logic would dictate that to stabilize the upper back against extension then one must protract the scapulae (which makes zero sense at all).  During the front squat, which requires a hefty amount of thorax stablization, a shelf is created with the front delts for the bar to sit on. If the shoulders were pulled down and back, the bar would choke the lifter. So, despite the shoulders not being down and back, the upper back somehow stays rigid during this movement (and that is because of the erectors).   during most of those movements    Rows? Retraction to protraction, not down and back. OHP? Upward rotation and elevation to downward rotation and depression, not down and back. Deadlifts? Full protraction and depression, not down and back. Bench? You got me here, simply because the lifter's back is held against the bench and the scapulae would meet resistance when moving, and because it shortens the ROM for a competitive lift. Notice how with pushups or any other horizontal push, it's protraction to retraction, not down and back. Pullups? Depression and downward rotation to elevation and upward rotation, not down and back.   Inhibiting the proper movement of the scapulae with ""down and back"" not only takes away from the effectiveness of the exercise, but increases the risk for shoulder injury, particularly with overhead movements."
AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,feddau,1 point,Sun Oct 12 13:16:54 2014 UTC,"Nice job on all of that. Thanks man. I'm a bit hyper-mobile and constantly battling desk worker posture... I tend to be pretty junky in my upper back as a result of the kyphosis and forward head. So annecdotally, I tend to feel and move better when I focus on staying down and back and ext rot'd and extended and chin packed in just about every movement. Its a pain in the ass but its stable and stronger. Getting old sucks.    Rows? Retraction to protraction, not down and back. OHP? Upward rotation and elevation to downward rotation and depression, not down and back. Deadlifts? Full protraction and depression, not down and back. Bench? You got me here, simply because the lifter's back is held against the bench and the scapulae would meet resistance when moving, and because it shortens the ROM for a competitive lift. Notice how with pushups or any other horizontal push, it's protraction to retraction, not down and back. Pullups? Depression and downward rotation to elevation and upward rotation, not down and back.    Perhaps all of that was shaded by my previous point regarding my shit posture. I stay down and back while rowing and deadlifting too. Even with pull ups I really have to think of my active shoulder position as being 'back and down', as opposed to just being 'down' otherwise I get no downward rotation."
AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,anactivegrenade,2,Sun Oct 12 13:48:26 2014 UTC,"Plenty of people do the same exact thing to cope with shitty posture.  Why not try front squatting more? It will not only strengthen the erectors in the upper back and also re-inforce the tucked-chin head position, it also requires that the scapulae NOT be fully retracted, or else you choke yourself with the barbell.   Hell, don't even squat with it for a bunch of reps if you don't want to mess with your knees. You can pause between reps to increase time under tension for your upper back. Your upper back will be smoked and you'll feel like you have rigor mortis that forces your upper back to be straight."

I'm not squatting right now, but I can pretty confidently squat 275 for a smooth set of 5 even when I'm not training that lift. Conversely..

Maintaining the retraction on the other exercises reduces the training effect and amount of weight you can use because you're not using the musculature isotonically, and you're cranking a humerus on a fixed scapulae; ergo bad for the shoulders.  down and back is ONLY applicable on bench and its variations"

The anterior structures are often tight while, the posterior structures become lax. Then, average joe wonders why he can't develop his mid and upper chest, and some unknowing trainer prescribes more incline press rather than having them lengthen their pec minor, and train the mid and upper trapezius. Things get worse from there. It can lead to shoulder impingement, biceps tendonitis, and eventually rotator cuff tears and or disfunction."

AdvancedFitness,2ixmq9,Just_a_College_Guy,2,Sat Oct 11 17:41:57 2014 UTC,"It definitely could. If you're scapula are out of place and alignment there's also a good chance the internal rotators of your shoulder are ""tight"" relative to your external rotators. The main concern there becomes the Lats. If those are tight you can't do any overhead movement as efficiently as possible."

Allowing yourself to hangout in shitty posture with your shoulders dumped forward, internally rotated and thoracically flexed will chronically shorten the pec minor. This leads to being further stuck in that excessively kyphotic posture and eventually it becomes so bad that you OH shoulder position is completely destroyed and when pressing overhead you smash a bunch of tissues into your acromion.

From my experience, the average casual powerlifter tends to have legs and upper back as their weaknesses. So many squats and deadlifts are lower back dominant because the person's legs are too weak (quads especially for squats and both quads and hamstrings for deadlifts). Back rounding in the deadlift and being slow off the chest in the bench are also big problems I see quite commonly, both of which can frequently be fixed by strengthening the lats (and upper back, but that's usually less of a problem for people)."

That leads to so many of the other issues that we see (listed here in somewhat of a sequence), like anterior pelvic tilt -> lumbar lordosis (excessively arched lower back) -> thoracic kyphosis (rounded upper back) which in turn leads to head forward posture, anterior scapular tilt (shoulders rolled forward) and shoulder impingement and/or pseudo-carpal tunnel symptoms.  This is a complicated question, but the single biggest issue to me would be the anterior pelvic tilt (which is the result of excessive 'tightness' in hip flexors, often coupled with insufficient tightness of the hamstrings (and hip extensors in general, but those are the major ones for pelvic tilt).  There are good arguments for other issues, such as poor gait patterns caused by external hip rotation which leads to a number of ankle, knee, and hip issues and in turn lower back problems.   I just think that by the numbers, and based on lifestyle factors, the pelvic tilt would be the single biggest one.  There are, however, quite a lot, many of which have been listed in this post."

This is pretty hard to do at first, but with a little practice it becomes pretty easy to control.  Mimicking a stretch doesn't mean that the stretch is being performed correctly, you know? Lots of people, including the vast majority of youtube videos (and even the great Pavel Tsatsouline) show hip flexor stretches that are not really performed correctly for correcting anterior pelvic tilt or excessive psoas tightness (one of several hip flexors, but an important one when looking to improve or prevent back pain).  Kit Laughlin has excellent stretching publications, with Stretching and Flexibility being the best for generalized stretching and his Neck, Back and Shoulder series being the preferred book for more targeted therapy for specific issues.

AdvancedFitness,2ip2tb,chuuun,2,Thu Oct 9 05:34:59 2014 UTC,"reducing inflammation will inhibit recovery is probably too general of a statement to be true.    Current evidence probably could only support saying something like ""Some ways of reducing inflammation can inhibit recovery"" as there is a lot we don't know and whether turmeric or ice inhibits recovery is still questionable.    I think they just have some evidence that ibuprofen and some other medications inhibits recovery. Turmeric might still work, it doesn't act among the same pathways.  Ice could still be okay too."
AdvancedFitness,2ip2tb,SlayerSBoxxy,1 point,Fri Oct 10 03:45:37 2014 UTC,Still a very general query. It all depends on the source of the joint pain
AdvancedFitness,2ip2tb,goatchop41,1 point,Thu Oct 9 06:43:02 2014 UTC,"I think there are arguments for using anti-inflammatory medications for certain joint related issues, such as bursitis.  The argument is that inflammation of tissue in the joint leads to swelling - and therefore any movement can cause further inflammation, due to decreased space in the joint, and the swelled tissue expanding and coming in contact with bone, etc.  The further inflammation leads to more swelling, and the condition becomes self-sustaining.   The idea is that reducing inflammation with ice, anti-inflammatory, rest, etc. will reduce the swelling and allow the healing - even though probably ideally it would be best just to immobilize, and then let the blood flow and heal naturally - that's not necessarily practical.  Is this still considered a valid treatment?  I assume this is the question."
AdvancedFitness,2ip2tb,omrsafetyo,1 point,Thu Oct 9 15:54:19 2014 UTC,"Everything has its uses, it's about using clinical reasoning to determine when to use them. A very simplified way to look at it is to ask one question: is the inflammation helpful? Examples in each direction would be: Helpful - inflammation after acute injury. The inflammation is the start of the cascade that leads to tissue healing and so it is useful (note here that inflammation and swelling are separate entities! When most people say that they want to reduce inflammation after acute injury, they really mean they want to reduce swelling. Inflammation signals the body to heal, swelling is there, in part, to naturally immobilise the body part) Not useful - inflammation in the ITB bursa as a result of compression by the ITB. Inflammation is a result of irritation, not injury, so doesn't really help things"

AdvancedFitness,2ikkjf,MadMaz23,4,Tue Oct 7 16:12:54 2014 UTC,"A chiropractor?   Sweet Jesus, no. Chiropractors can do nothing but harm for hypermobility. I saw a kid today who had hypermobile joints all over his body and went to a chiropractor with patellar tendinopathy, and the fucking chiropractor did high velocity manipulations to the kid's knee. Fucking retarded, as it obviously didn't fix the problem and he could have torn ligaments, creating a much bigger problem.  Anyway, onto your question.  Connective tissue provides passive support to joints, i.e. support that happens whether or not you're trying to make it happen. Muscle provide active and passive support, so when you actively contract them they provide support, but at the same time, they're always contracting at least a little bit without conscious input, and also have bigass proteins called titin that provide passive support.  When you lose connective tissue in a joint (labrum tear), you lose passive support for that joint. Surgery can sometimes repair this and fix that loss of passive support, but if that doesn't work or you're worried about hypermobility elsewhere in the body, there's another option: make your muscles bigger and stronger, and you'll get an increase in passive support from motor tone and more titin.   Now, the tricky part is figuring out which muscles you want to make stronger, because sometimes some muscles get way stronger than others and actually increase problems at a joint. A good example of this is in your neck: when you get neck pain, small muscles right up against the spine (deep cervical flexors) turn off, and sternocleidomastoid turns on harder to try and compensate. However, sternocleidomastoid pulls differently than the deep flexors, and it can actually make the problem worse. Another example is at your knees; when your hamstrings are less than 66% as strong as your quads, there's a significantly increased risk for ACL tears.  So how do you figure out what muscles to strengthen? Go to a good physical therapist, and when you're done with the therapy, have them write you up a home program that you can continue with forever.   As for your labrum surgery, FRICKIN LISTEN TO YOUR THERAPIST. How your shoulder feels is not reflective of the state of the healing tissue. There has been a lot of research done to figure out timetables of healing tissue, and the prescribed exercises and progression in physical therapy will be based on that."

The good news, if any, is that it's manageable if you're dedicated, stick to your exercises and don't overdo it.  Having said that, I had my initial dislocation and labral tear (snowboarding accident) when I was 22. I'm 28 now and it's still a permanent issue you just have to keep dealing with as life goes on. It helps to set your expectations early and realize you'll never go back to where it was.  What really matters though is keeping it strong, and avoid uncontrolled environments such as surfing and martial arts. You'll be able to get back to weightlifting though, and re-build your strength to pre-dislocation levels, but yeah... uncontrolled environments really fuck you up. Avoid martial arts, surfing and bar fights."
AdvancedFitness,2ikkjf,NorthernTrash,2,Tue Oct 7 19:06:22 2014 UTC,"I also had a SLAP repair last year, and I've yet to attempt any submission/grappling stuff that I used to do myself, heck I'm too afraid to do handstands and cartwheels.  Whether you actually have any hypermobility issues or not, I wouldn't be surprised if the surgeon is using ""hypermobility"" synonymously with ""instability"" to describe things in more layterms. The labrum functions just like the meniscus of the knee, where it increases the surface area of the joint to make it more stable (think of it as making the socket seem deeper to make the shoulder more stable). Having a torn labrum will certainly make your shoulder unstable, and in lay terms, it may seem more hypermobile (keep in mind this is just a possible interpretation).  As someone that experienced this surgery myself and also a physical therapist, you should stick to seeing your physical therapist. A chiro would certainly not help, especially in your situation, and there has been no evidence (or not enough) afaik that concluded that supplements can help with this type of injury (let alone for joint health in general). Labral tears/repair surgery are not painful because of the nature of the labrum, so it would be very important for you to stick to your PT's recommendations. It would be important for you to convey to your PT that you are intending on returning to said sports/activities so that they will understand the extent of the rehab that will be required. It's also not a bad idea to perhaps ask your surgeon and/or PT for any post-operative protocols so that you can get a better idea on the time frame and progession for recovery (there are 4 types of SLAP tear and they have different protocols)."

I tore my labrum multiple times doing martial arts and eventually got it confirmed by an MRI. Long story short: It took me a really long time to get my shoulder back to being mostly stable. You should definitely do physical therapy for as long as you can afford it. Then you should really hit the weightroom. In the end, I found that the best exercises to get it better were deadlifts, barbell rows, and turkish get-ups in that order. This emphasis on strengthening the muscle and connective tissue in your posterior deltoid, trapezius muscles, and rotator cuff will stabilize the shoulder and hopefully prevent this kind of injury in the future."

Be diligent about rehab and strengthen it (military press, front raises, lateral raises)."
AdvancedFitness,2ikkjf,frankida,1 point,Wed Oct 8 03:01:52 2014 UTC,"I have had the same surgery to reattach my labrum in my left shoulder about two years ago.   Similarly my shoulders sublex and sort of pop in and out both sides.   I did judo in high school and college but can  live with some discomfort.   My shoulder would dislocate consistently while playing sports and at a certain point I couldn't take it anymore.   Assuming you lift,  what works for me is warm up with arm circles and the stretch where you put your arms above your head  against a door frame and lean forward.   Also what works for me is starting with super light weight and doing reps like they are heavy.   Exercises I can't do that hurt are essentially bar dips and sometimes thrusters.   Also I stay away from barbell bench because I end up spraying my elbows out and it puts pressure on my shoulder.     This may sound dumb but what  you have to do workout is to do what works for you.   If you have sharp lingering pain stop doing the exercise.     Other things that work,  get a rubber lacrosse ball and roll it against front or back of your shoulder against a wall.   Also a good massage and the hot tub will do wonders for keeping your muscles loose.   Ultimately surgery sucks and does limit your range of motion and ability to exercise but it's better than your shoulder popping out.   Mine hasn't popped out since the surgery.   Good luck.

You shouldn't be doing anything your physical therapist tells you exactly when and how to.  Even though you may feel okay or have limited pain you're still liable to screw up recovery.  Easily.  Recovery is going to be a long:  with mine it's 4 more weeks in constant sling, 6 weeks after of limited active weight physical ( just the weight of the arm), then 3 months of limited to moderate exercise AND THEN, 6 months in, I can begin flirting with some of my old routines.  Honestly, if recovery is perfect and I stay completely dedicated to what they tell me I'm not expecting anything great until at least 9 months out.  It's long but it's needed:  my arm was dislocating on every freestyle recovery.  Before the surgery I was doing a ton of PT as well.  Powerlifting was a big help (no bench press though) to get it in line for daily activities, but nothing could stop it from dislocating during swimming even then.  Surgery was needed for mine."
AdvancedFitness,2ikkjf,jcesus,1 point,Wed Oct 8 05:41:10 2014 UTC,"Maz,  Coming at it from my point of view as a 21 year old with very flexible shoulders, who has had failed surgery and continued instability perhaps I can give some examples of what I would have done differently.  I was 16 years old, and 8 months from the day I got surgery I was givin the pec deck shit when what do you know, I dislocated my shoulder again. Don't do heavy pec deck or flies for a couple years. Start light and build your strength up.  I have never since that day, 5 years later, dislocated my shoulder in the weight room. Doing heavy presses, pulls etc. However overhead movement is all light for me as it causes pain. Therefore I would make these movements an area of emphasis  Commit to working out, getting stronger, and getting more muscle mass. Keep up with rotator cuff work and physiotherapy. After a while I no longer needed to go to physio, just do the exercises on your own once you are past needing advice on what to do.  A number of my dislocations have come when doing physical activity drunk. Have a nothing physical rule when drinking. (e.g trampolines, wrestling, dancing with my hands up, playing catch).  I have dislocated my shoulder in my sleep a few times, so I now sleep with a sling and I have not dislocated it since. You probably don't have to sleep in a sling. lmao  It is sound advice to avoid uncontrolled movements while surfing and the like, however throwing your arm in the air to make a save, or block a pass can be dangerous as well. (handball for me)  Overall I believe I would have been successful had I avoided the initial pec deck incident and kept on with progressive weight training and physiotherapy. Avoid uncontrolled movements until you get back in to your sport which may require some, and don't get drunk and do dumb shit. It will definitely feel better than it is, so listen to your surgeon and the like as others have pointed out. Good luck mate. p.s I am managing the chronic instability better now, steady training and not being a dumb shit"

AdvancedFitness,2ikkjf,dasmountain,1 point,Fri Oct 10 04:03:36 2014 UTC,"Hypermobility is usually used to describe a situation in which the actual joint capsule of the glenohumeral joint has increased laxity, allowing the joint itself to be less stable. Meaning, it can move more freely out of the glenoid(the part of the scapula where the humerus, the upper arm bone, sits). Now, when you tear the labrum, the actual glenoid itself is less able to maintain the position of the joint, which allows the humerus to move out of the joint more easily.   ALSO, now that you're had surgery, there is swelling and numerous structures have been moved around and irritated to get to the surgical site. So, some of the muscle that work to stabilize that joint(rotator cuff, serratus anterior, etc) may not be working properly. In addition, the repair itself is in a very fragile state at this point. Your physical therapist will create and execute a protocol to get all those muscle and stabilizers working correctly so that they correctly stabilize the joint with  movement, in addition to doing things at a rate that does not damage the repair.   So, BE PATIENT. This is a significant surgery and takes a while to recover from. However, recovery rates from labral repairs with physical therapy are very good. You need to be patient, listen to your PT, and do exactly what they tell you. You wouldn't try to follow three different weight training programs at once, so don't try to find different health care providers to give you different protocols and different information. Pick the guys who are specifically trained in post-op rehabilitation, and stick with the plan.   Source: I am a physical therapist."

Basically, a lot of studies aren't realistic because they're focusing on isolated substances in unnatural environments using unrealistic doses. Meaning that most of the things that people say are bad for you and that quote the literature probably don't fully understand the literature.   Also, when grains and seeds are concerned, cooking methods matter as humans have evolved away from a majority plant based diet.   Cook things long and slow for best results. True for most foods.   If you think something is causing a reaction in you don't focus on a lab test to tell you. Take that item and things in the same family out of your diet, analyze the different mechanisms from that group of foods and slowly introduce parts back into your diet 30 days later.   Example is dairy. They said that there are people who have developed very good mechanisms for breaking down lactose. Those that don't break it down well still usually do well with cheese, cream and butter. Those with a casein intolerance are basically stuck with ghee and butter. I think those were the two."

I usually lift in the afternoons from 10-12:30 with a strict weightlifting program designed to peak me this november 1st. Therefore, the volume is lowest and the intensity is the highest.  I decided to workout at night one evening and found that I slept like a baby afterwards.   Bear in mind, I don't take caffeine before lifting. Just a carb + protein shake before, during and after lifting."

AdvancedFitness,2ifqu8,Boobem,3,Tue Oct 7 10:11:08 2014 UTC,"“It is important to note that there were substantial differences in the duration of training between the 2 protocols studied.  The [hypetrophy] protocol took approximately ~17 minutes to perform, while the [strength] required a time commitment of more than 1 hour.  Given the similar hypertrophic gains between groups, [the hypertrophy protocol] was a much more time-efficient strategy for eliciting these increases. Moreover, personal communications with subjects both during and after the study revealed that those in the [strength] group generally felt highly fatigued both physically and mentally from the workouts while the [hypetrophy] group tended to report being willing and able to extend the duration of their training.  It therefore stands to reason that the [hypertrophy] group could have endured additional volume in their routines while those in the [strength] group were at their upper limits of tolerance.”"

AdvancedFitness,2i7rwd,isthisallforme,7,Fri Oct 3 19:32:33 2014 UTC,"The myth came from the fact they noticed in patients with pathologic kidney conditions, reducing protein intake ameliorated symptoms. A healthy individual will not have these problems. I believe a higher protein diet will simply affect the tuberoglomerular feedback sensitivity, leading to an elevated GFR causing an overall increase in pressure of the glomerulus, glomerular capillaries, and increasing hyperfiltration.  Much of the reason is because of the nitrogen prod in the form of urea, which must be excreted. If you had a large surplus of urea, yet a slow GFR, you could run into some problems.  To delve further into the nuances, high protein diets seem to enhance NaCl reabsorption along the thick ascending limb, so that the luminal concentration of NaCl at the macula densa falls. Ergo, consequently, the flow in the loop of henle (and thus GFR) must rise to increase NaCl levels at the macula densa. The caveat, reiterated from above: only if there's an intrinsic renal disease will these changes lead to permanent glomerular damage.   Now, because I've gotten hampered on this forum before for sources, as if I'm simply making some up, here's a few:  Boron's ""Medical Physiology"" textbook Alan Aragon's book, ""Girth Control""  And because no one can visibly ascertain the veridical nature of that I'm putting forth, here's a nice study on the topic: http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/2/1/25  and another very succinct and lay-person friendly article from Alan Aragon as well (he went into more detail in his book): http://www.simplyshredded.com/the-truth-behind-5-food-myths.html  Also, as for the article posted in the OP that we're discussing, their recommendation of 2g/kg is even on the high end of what's necessary for optimal muscle growth, which coincides somewhere around 1.7-1.8g/kg, so there's literally no cause for concern on all fronts."

That said, it's a pretty level headed paper and it even concludes with a 2g/kg/d limit where they suggest going any higher leads to no benefit or possible detriments.  That lines up almost perfectly with the standard advice of 1g/lb (2.2g/kg) and even that's more commonly knocked down to 0.8g/lb these days.    http://examine.com/faq/how-much-protein-do-i-need-every-day.html"

If ""high protein diet"" is ~.8/lb (as defined In the studies as the level above which,  signs of kidney stress (on a healthy subject) appear) that adds new context to the ""shoot for 1g/lb"" recommendation that we see thrown around. Yes, 1 is easier math than .8, but is, technically, well into ""high protein"" range.   Also, the language of ""target"" .8g/lb is perhaps too soft. Some of these studies show renal stress at those levels with healthy subjects.   This article (published in 2000) is likely to be the source that physicians are referring to mentally. If it has been since refuted, that would be nice to know. It also is good to know that ""high protein"" is as low as .8g/lb."

AdvancedFitness,2i7rwd,Moto_Mitsuhide,3,Fri Oct 3 23:51:50 2014 UTC,"In that meta study, there were a handful of controlled studies only two of which have any bearing on ""athletes"" or healthy individuals. Of those two, the interesting one was the Chow et al, correlating high red meat/high protein content food/staples consumption to renal cell cancer in people who had been diagnosed with cancer versus a control group.  Personally, I think it would have been helpful to dive more fully into their EXACT diets, but that data is not available to us.  In Feskanich et al, I'm willing to reject that article outright for a variety of reasons, based on the abstract.  Given that, at best, an abstract was listed for the sources in the article you linked, it's a little difficult to corroborate or refute the author's findings.  However, I am not willing to overcome a pay-wall to argue with someone on the internet about a relatively silly point.  That being said, don't ramp up your intake too quickly, you'll have protein farts and some other complications.  I read precisely one article that ever put a firm cap on protein intake, I'll try to find it again.    If you want your kidneys to be happy, in general, drink plenty of water and try to not eat over processed bullshit.  In the end, if you're really worried about the damage high protein intake can do, write up a grant submission and conduct a longitudinal study to find out."

This study also confirms that.   It's useful for its scope but it would be cool to see other variables manipulated, exercise modality being one of them. Or see how the kettlebell swing matches up in actual levels to say, a deadlift. That way we have real context to just how much T and GH are increased through a kettlebell swinging workout."

Lateral raises, front raises (lifting the straight arm up in front, what a stupid exercise, "" but it totally hits my anterior delts brooooo""), bicep curls, triceps kickbacks, the list goes on and on. People isolate them because of vanity, but compound exercises will arguably help more because working more muscle will promote more systemic effects associated with muscle growth. Most people will get more bang for their buck with compound movements so that you can get as much muscle working as possible.

The amount of gain you would get by hyperextension is not enough to justify expending that amount of energy.  The ultimate goal of your workout is measured in load-volume. If you can increase your volume as a whole, it has been shown to increase your 1RM which means you're going to see bigger numbers.   So if you can lift 20lbs to hyperextension but you can do the same reps with 30 to parallel you're talking an additional 100lbs every 10 reps. 4-5 sets and now you're talking 500lbs extra lifted a week. That's significant numbers.  Potentially dangerous is not something I can comment on without knowing more about your medical history.

While moderate-intensity exercise has proven to have protective and beneficial effects on the cortex and hippocampus resulting in improved spatial memory, high-intensity exercise is capable of doing quite the opposite. Exitotoxicity of glutamate triggers ER stress-induced apoptosis, which generally precedes the common apoptosis pathway, and the reduced SYP levels signal a diminished level of synaptic plasticity. Knowing that fitters are strong proponents of ignoring LISS in favor of constant high-intensity work (don't tell Brian MacKenzie), we can hypothesize that those who subscribe to the fitter's programming methods will have diminished mental function.

My first thought is crossfit, for I have trained using crossfit in the past, and can definitely attest to extreme levels of exhaustion at the end of some workouts.  Also, the researchers came to some conclusions about ""overtraining syndrome"" being caused by this apoptosis phenomenon.

In the pdf posted he doesn't say best cardio for what?  also when he lists ""best"" choices, he doesn't quantify what those terms mean.  Like when they say ""boxing"" does he mean drills, sparring, match time then those variations should be done at different heart rates to quantify them.  Honestly i think the best cardio is one that suits your goal, has a risk reward amount you're comfortable with and fits into your schedule.  Like maybe a person does high rep swings not for the cardio benefits, but does them to practice keeping core tension or maybe they just hate running.  The best exercise or training is what you'll stick with.   If i had to rank my the forms of cardio i enjoy, it would be: Grappling > Hiking/climbing > TGU > Swings > Sprints > Long distance running  But say i was trying to up my grappling cardio, i would choose TGU over everything else because they can be done for high reps, they're forgiving if you're form gets sloppy and you're highly unlikely to hurt anything doing them and they can be done really quickly."

AdvancedFitness,2hy3sx,Joshua_Naterman,-2,Wed Oct 1 01:19:24 2014 UTC,"I will say that low bar squats really shouldn't be done in O-lifting shoes. You're just going to put more stress on the quads.  Just because you lift heavy doesn't mean you're lifting with good form. Only video from multiple angles of the same set of reps(well, preferably the same set) can really tell us that for sure, and even then there may be some issues that can't be visually recognized."

AdvancedFitness,2hy3sx,Tri-Color,2,Wed Oct 1 02:22:05 2014 UTC,"The heels in Nike shoes are higher than most other weightlifting/olympic shoes.  While the difference may seem minimal, in contrast with your ROM it could be a huge difference; after all, you're having problems with mechanics while wearing them it sounds like. A lot of power athletes don't use Nike shoes for this very reason.  Use whatever works for you.  I will say I have some friends who are training on the US weightlifting team and while they use Nike as kind of a formality, they said they had to really get used to them, i.e., dumbing down weight in order to get used to the larger heel raise.  Take that for what it's worth, but I'd toss them or sell them if I were you."
AdvancedFitness,2hy3sx,EatUrVeggies,2,Wed Oct 1 13:04:13 2014 UTC,"Hey man. This seems to be a mobility issue. The raised heel on the shoe allows you to get deeper in the hole without too much stress on your hip and back if you dont have the mobility. The romaleos have a slightly higher heel than the adipowers, the higher heel puts more stress on the quad, which might have caused the strain to begin with. You said that after your rehab (stretching and icing) the squat felt better. Might be due to the added mobility due to stretching. My advice, keep squatting without shoes on, build that strength back up and strengthen your quads with some isolation work. Then, when you feel like your quads might be stronger, start introducing the shoes and see how you feel.  Best of luck."

AdvancedFitness,2hy3sx,s-mcl,2,Wed Oct 1 15:09:16 2014 UTC,"This very well could be true. For the first 10 years of my competitive life I used work boots (Oly Shoes were hard to get and to honest I seriously doubt I would have wore them. I wanted the ankle support). As I got bigger the heals became an issue with my knees and depth so I filed 1/2 of it off (work boot heals are bigger than most Oly shoes) and the issues went away. When I moved to Westide and to my stance out the boots made it way to hard to sit back like Louie was trying to get me to do so I went to Chucks first (hated them) and then to wrestling shoes and finally to boxing shoes. To answer you question, yes it does matter and will change as one get bigger, stronger and with different stances. From what I can see with my limited time on here if you want to get a debate or discussion like this if seems you need to use extremes such as a low heal Oly shoe to a boot. It seems to me most people are just wearing whatever somebody else told them to get and has nothing to do with their squat style or stance. I do like the direction you were trying to go here."

AdvancedFitness,2hxdpt,SwoleScientist,10,Tue Sep 30 22:55:34 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure stripper booty applies to lumbar hyperxtension.  OP has a flexion problem during the pull, not an extension problem.  He does have an extension problem at lockout though (note the lean back). He also has no clue how to set his back and hips prior to even pulling in the first place, which shows he's had no instruction, or hasn't had the patience in learning how to do it properly in the first place.  @ /u/derpost: here is how to get a better looking pull:   Take 50-80lbs off the bar. set the bar over your midfoot (the middle of the whole foot; not the instep) your stance should be hip width with your toes pointed out about 10-15 degrees; knees inline with toes. set your grip on the bar narrow, but not too narrow that your elbows run into your knees.  Don't move the bar. push your shins into the bar, dropping the hips.  Don't move the bar. lift your chest up to extend your thoracic spine.  Ensure you have natural lordosis (slight lumbar extension).  You are starting with lumbar flexion. isometrically contract your lats, spinal erectors, and abdominals in the starting position, whilst taking the slack out of the bar.  Take a big deep breath of air.  Pull. don't lean back at the top.  Stop in a normal standing position.  Think about contracting your glutes at the top. if you can't do the eccentric the bar is too heavy. don't max out, stick to sets of 3-6"
AdvancedFitness,2hxdpt,mrcosmicna,1 point,Wed Oct 1 01:19:34 2014 UTC,"This is sort of a tangent, but I have a question for you about this:    your stance should be hip width with your toes pointed out about 10-15 degrees; knees inline with toes. set your grip on the bar narrow, but not too narrow that your elbows run into your knees    So, I am a human of the female persuasion - as such, not only are my hips wider than my shoulders, but they are naturally more turned out than a dude's, making it difficult to achieve a narrow grip on a conventional deadlift. I think I have decent form, but I've recently been realizing that if I turn out my feet more (to about 40 or 45-deg out from forward) on my squats and deads, I can get much better hamstring and glute activation, and really focus on using my posterior chain in addition to my quads.   The problem is that ""hip width"" for my feet plus the additional foot turnout means that my knees are completely in the way of my arms, and at the narrowest grip possible, arms are significantly wider than shoulder width. So, my setup looks kind of like this but with slightly wider stand and arms (so arms obviously not straight down) - whereas with this stance, I get 0% assistance from glutes and hamstrings.   Is this grip width a problem? I've considered trying sumo style deadlifts so I can pull with my arms straight down, but I don't have a coach and worry I would butcher the form, plus it feels like a cop-out."
AdvancedFitness,2hxdpt,dontforgetpants,1 point,Wed Oct 1 20:45:56 2014 UTC,It sounds like you are trying the increased toe out and aren't having problems. There's no problem with toe out if you're lifting for fitness and not competition. Internally/externally rotating the hip will change the congruence of the acetabulum and the femoral head. You may have anteversion or retroversion that makes 10-15º insufficient for your toe out. Keep your back engaged and neutral to slightly extended and you should be OK.

AdvancedFitness,2hxdpt,anactivegrenade,5,Tue Sep 30 21:53:35 2014 UTC,"Deadlifts hurt your back because your form isn't good dude.  Notice how your spine isn't locked at all throughout the lift. It flexes when your first pull the bar, then you hyperextend at the top.  There should be nearly zero movement in your spine when you deadlift, unless it's near-maximal weight.  The purpose of the core/back is to TRANSFER force by resisting movement, not to generate force through movement.  Back to your question, I'd say no, rack pulls are not as good for your purposes as a sprinter because it involves a very small ROM in your hips, whereas deadlifts use a hue amount of ROM in your hips.  EDIT: This article gives a simplified explanation as to how the back gets injured during lifting, and preaches the importance of a neutral spine."
AdvancedFitness,2hxdpt,milouhi,4,Tue Sep 30 21:58:41 2014 UTC,"I really dont know why so many people are advising you to get your 'hips down', if you do this your hips will just shoot back up as soon as you start the lift. I think the height of your hips is excellent for good leverage, what should be fixed is the tilt of your hips. Your hips need more flexion at the starting position, this means your butt should be pointing further up. To visualize this a different way, if you pause the video right before you start the pull you can see some slight lower back rounding, you need to rotate your hips a few degrees clockwise until your spine reaches a neutral form. The way i like to get into position is NOT by bending over to reach the bar, instead i flex at the hips, or push my butt back, and keep my torso totally straight until i reach the bar. If your hip mobility does not allow you to do this, then this should be your main priority and i have personally used rack pulls to fix this issue and i would recommend you can do the same.  You should start by placing the pins slightly below your knees and of course use a lighter weight. Reach for the bar by flexing your hips instead of bending your back, this should be easy with the pins at this height. Now instead of pulling the bar up, push into your heels and push your hips into the bar by squeezing your glues, to put it bluntly you are basically trying to fuck the bar. Now control the weight back down again by flexing at the hips, and not allowing your lower back to round. Make sure you start by using a weight that you can control on the way down. I should also note that breathing properly can also help take some stress off your lower back. Before you start you want to take a deep breath, but most importantly you need to expand your belly as you do so thus increasing your core stability.  As you progress with the rack pulls you should lower the pins, the lower the pins the more hip flexion until eventually you can do this off the floor. Hope this helps you as it helped me, good luck."

What exactly are you looking to obtain by doing them?   Yes, there are some form issues with your pull but I think it is important to step back and look at the main reasons why you are in the weight room and how it will carry over to sprinting. I'm not saying there are not valid reasons for doing them, more so I am asking why you feel you need to do them.   When strength training is your GPP (as it is to a track athlete) than it becomes more important to define the reasons, risks and benefits to everything you do outside the track."

AdvancedFitness,2hwomc,GloriousPancake,3,Tue Sep 30 19:48:04 2014 UTC,"15 people (9 men, 6 women) who were in their late teens early twenties (22.1 ± 3.6 years old).  Subjects had to have trained both lifts for at least a year a minimum of once a week during their regular training sessions.  Subjects were free from any orthopedic injuries.   Edit: Here is the Abstract (which is freely available)  A biomechanical comparison of back and front squats in healthy trained individuals.  Gullett JC1, Tillman MD, Gutierrez GM, Chow JW.  Abstract  The strength and stability of the knee plays an integral role in athletics and activities of daily living. A better understanding of knee joint biomechanics while performing variations of the squat would be useful in rehabilitation and exercise prescription. We quantified and compared tibiofemoral joint kinetics as well as muscle activity while executing front and back squats. Because of the inherent change in the position of the center of mass of the bar between the front and back squat lifts, we hypothesized that the back squat would result in increased loads on the knee joint and that the front squat would result in increased knee extensor and decreased back extensor muscle activity. A crossover study design was used. To assess the net force and torque placed on the knee and muscle activation levels, a combination of video and force data, as well as surface electromyographic data, were collected from 15 healthy trained individuals. The back squat resulted in significantly higher compressive forces and knee extensor moments than the front squat. Shear forces at the knee were small in magnitude, posteriorly directed, and did not vary between the squat variations. Although bar position did not influence muscle activity, muscle activation during the ascending phase was significantly greater than during the descending phase. The front squat was as effective as the back squat in terms of overall muscle recruitment, with significantly less compressive forces and extensor moments. The results suggest that front squats may be advantageous compared with back squats for individuals with knee problems such as meniscus tears, and for long-term joint health."
AdvancedFitness,2hwomc,razzark666,2,Tue Sep 30 19:52:38 2014 UTC,"Thank you! Sorry, I looked for the abstract but didn't find it."
AdvancedFitness,2hwomc,GloriousPancake,0,Tue Sep 30 19:59:22 2014 UTC,"Interesting, thanks for posting that.  I still hold to my point that you can't just say the front squat is an adequate replacement for the back squat because it's more comfortable for some, but I am curious about how they are measuring muscle activation.  I do not see anyway it is possible to have the same EMG activity in the muscles when not only does front squat use different muscles (more focus on quad and glutes, less on hams), they also use different weights.  Can reading the study more closely shed any light on that issue?"
AdvancedFitness,2hwomc,lift_heavy_things,8,Tue Sep 30 19:01:28 2014 UTC,The study is saying that there isn't significantly more focus on the quads and glutes though. That's just what you're saying
AdvancedFitness,2hwomc,octacok,2,Tue Sep 30 19:13:26 2014 UTC,You can use less weight and get more muscle activation by repositioning the weight to change levers. Eg ohp vs front raise. Not sure if that's the case with the front and back squat.
AdvancedFitness,2hwomc,masuk,2,Tue Sep 30 20:51:16 2014 UTC,"Yes that is a good point, but in the case of FS vs BS you have three main muscle groups: the quads, hams and glutes.  The ratios between these three muscles could change dramatically, theoretically, between the two squats, but I would not expect the total amount of activation to change.  Regardless, this study proposes that the total amount of activation remains the same, and the ratios remain the same.  That seems suspect to me.  I've now gotten access to the full study and will try and read it more in depth tonight."
AdvancedFitness,2hwomc,lift_heavy_things,1 point,Tue Sep 30 21:15:26 2014 UTC,In my experience the front squat does hurt my lower back less (I have a lower back injury) although with significant weight both squats will leave my back sore the next day so I can't really do either
AdvancedFitness,2hwomc,octacok,1 point,Tue Sep 30 19:14:25 2014 UTC,I didn't read the study. But I do a lot of front squatting and it helps my back squat tremendously. It brings the focus onto the legs really well.   Front squat. High bar squat. Low bar squat. Doesn't matter. The joints are pulled on in straight lines. So they produce the same tension.
AdvancedFitness,2hwomc,alarmstrong,1 point,Tue Sep 30 19:47:58 2014 UTC,"Aside from what has already been mentioned in the article, and ratio and activation of the muscle groups and mechanics, each of the lifts can be beneficial depending on your goals. If you're trying to GET HUGE, the back squat is probably a better option as it will allow you to do more weight. On the other hand, if you're lifting for power it is likely you'll also be doing power cleans. The front squat is useful when doing heavier weight so you can get underneath the bar and front squat it up.  I don't think we definitively say which is better, but each one can serve a different purpose.  Personally, I do both."

AdvancedFitness,2hvgp2,MHath,1 point,Tue Sep 30 15:07:57 2014 UTC,"The Kenyans, specifically the Kalenjin tribe dominate marathon running for a variety of reasons....least of all because of LSD training. This may sound crazy but Kenyan runners might be so darn good because of their requisite adult circumcision practice. It is a ‘brutal’ initiation ceremony into adulthood most boys must endure, resulting in an indomitable tolerance to suffering.  Many Kenyans who live in Kalenjin country (a tribe of 2.7 million) are primed from a very young age to withstand vast amounts of pain. As children, they practice for it by cutting and burning themselves.  There is immense social pressure for boys at the age of 13 to go through a deeply scarring and painful ceremony in order to be branded ‘brave’ and marriage worthy. Combine this innate ability to deal with suffering, the typical body structure of a Kenyan (thin ankles/calves with a medium to light stature), add in higher altitude training, a drive to escape rampant poverty and the canonization of the sport via the local idols it creates and viola!, you get one fantastic endurance athlete."
AdvancedFitness,2hvgp2,dpjoachim,1 point,Thu Oct 2 02:23:31 2014 UTC,"I feel like WRT the sport of rowing (and not whatever fitness benefits associated with erging), very long steady state is as much mental training as it is physical. I remember the longest sessions would last hours and it was a big challenge to keep my numbers down the entire time without expending too much energy or losing focus. My coach was a big believer in the mental aspects of racing so that might be why very long steady states are still used."

AdvancedFitness,2htizd,TheNCGoalie,6,Mon Sep 29 20:12:40 2014 UTC,"A good paper to read (there are others, but this will encapsulate the prevailing notion of the movements):  Shoulder Muscle Activation of Novice and Resistance Trained Women during Variations of Dumbbell Press Exercises   ... No significant differences were found between experienced and novice resistance trained individuals. For the upper trapezius and anterior deltoid muscles, shoulder press activation was significantly greater than incline press which in turn was significantly greater than bench press across both phases. The bench and incline presses promoted significantly greater pectoralis major sternal activation compared to the shoulder press (both phases). While pectoralis major clavicular activation during the incline press eccentric phase was significantly greater than both the bench and shoulder presses, activation during the bench press concentric phase promoted significantly greater activation than the incline press which in turn was significantly greater than the shoulder press. These results provide evidence for selecting exercises in resistance and rehabilitation programs.   To answer your question it should be more difficult to press weight vertically as your body moves towards the perpendicular to the ground. This is due to less stability in your pectoralis muscles and greater activation in the (much) weaker deltoid muscles. At parallel to ground, you will utilize the greatest strength from your pecs, and a 90degree perpendicular, the least, with the most shoulder and back activation.  Further reading: 1 -- 2"

AdvancedFitness,2htizd,xandarg,8,Mon Sep 29 21:21:14 2014 UTC,"The order you do the exercises in will also determine how much you can lift, since earlier sets will fatigue you for the later sets (even though they all hit the muscle slightly differently).  You should put first whatever is most important for your goal (flat press first if your goal is to compete in the flat press, incline press first if you're looking to emphasize your upper pecs and front delts, etc.) As for adding weight, you should be adding weight whenever you can. You'll find that on some exercises, you can't do that as frequently because they're more difficult. This way, you'll end up lifting more on lifts you're able to, and less on ones that you aren't--it all takes care of itself."

If you're looking for a specific recommendation on how many calories per day over your TDEE you should eat if you're looking to gain muscle at an optimal rate (given the program you're currently on and all the other variables personal to you), then I'd recommend starting at something reasonable (say 250 calories over TDEE assuming you're a male who has finished his newb gains), and measuring your weight change and bf% change over time. If you're gaining fat, then your surplus is too big. If you're not gaining any fat, you can continue slowly increasing the calories until you ARE. That will be the point at which you know that any additional calories you consume go to fat, instead of muscle, and thus you've found your optimal intake. Huzzah!"

I've never been in a sauna before. When it gets to be 100 (°F) outside, it's hard for me to be outside for more than 10-20 minutes. The temperatures in a sauna seem outrageous."
AdvancedFitness,2hj2en,Humannn,1 point,Fri Oct 3 21:34:06 2014 UTC,"Mainly I think It's because you take a shower before you go to sauna and the air in sauna is not moving as much as it is when you are outside. Relatively still air creates an insulating barrier next to your skin and the vaporizing water will also keep you cooler.  Oh, and I've been talking about a wet sauna in this thread."
AdvancedFitness,2hj2en,Magitus,2,Sat Oct 4 05:39:55 2014 UTC,"Would the same benefits occur from having a hot bath?  Given that It's about increasing body temperature that'd make sense wouldn't it?  Edit:  In the comments section Dr. Patrick writes ""Most of the studies were done using dry sauna, which is why dry sauna is mentioned. Other means of elevating core body temperature may also apply, but they must be able to elevate it to a point of physical discomfort (ie. sitting in a hot bath for 30 min. would not compare to sitting in 176 degree F sauna for 30 min.""    I would've thought it'd be easier to elevate body temperature to discomfort levels while being saturated in hot water rather than hot air."

AdvancedFitness,2hj2en,radical_badger,2,Sun Sep 28 18:43:47 2014 UTC,"I started taking very hot baths a few years ago just for the fun of inducing the high which is mentioned in the article.  I basically get the water to a quite hot level, submerge myself as much as possible (only knees and head are above water), do that for about 20 - 30 mins or until I feel too uncomfortable (not burning, just uncomfortable), then slowly run pure hot water till my heart is thumping and I can't take it and get out.    The only sauna I go to is at my gym and is set at roughly 80C, and in my experience the hot baths take me to a level of exhaustion that I can't get in the sauna.  I feel good after a sauna, but after a bath I virtually collapse on my floor from exhaustion and once even thought I had a religious experience lol, which I assume is the 'runner's high' type effect.

The only muscle groups that regularly get static stretching for me are hip flexors and quads."
AdvancedFitness,2hjt0q,Camerongilly,1 point,Sat Sep 27 12:17:36 2014 UTC,"There are studies for both sides of the static stretching debate.  The demands of flexibility and being mobile are key here. If a person cannot properly move because of their inflexibilities then they are at a higher risk of injury. eg if an athlete cannot fully squat, why teach them how to snatch?  While static stretching is an controversial as it is, being able to properly move throughout an entire range of motion, is not controversial.  My point being, ignore the controversy, move along, become flexible. Whether it is through yoga, ART, myofascial release, AIS, or PNF. Being mobile and flexible is immensely important to athletes and non athletes."

If you want to be a mass of flesh who squats 800lbs your needs for flexibility are going to be different than someone who wants to run a 4.6 40.  This comes to mind because, anecdotally, I'm a former college football player who once had some decent wheels but spent the past couple of years doing not much besides powerlifting... not much stretching, zero running.  I got up around the 500/425/620 mark at around 250lbs, tried to play some flag football and tore the fuck out of my psoas on the third play of the game.  A few weeks later, I filmed my running and sweet jesus am I ever tight, I look like I have a stick shoved up my ass.

Practicing a ""3rd world squat"" (butt to the ground, feet flat, lumbar neutral and upright torso) on a regular basis will do wonders for your functional flexibility of your ankle, hip, knee and back; firing patterns of your legs and back musculature; and help alleviate lumbar discomfort.   Elderly American are rarely capable of a squat like this - yet all over the world (specifically in places that don't have many chairs) it is a common site to see centenarians, whom never spend any time ""stretching"" easily get into the position to eat, defecate or just hang out."

I had/have the required flexibility to do an ATG high bar squat, (granted, in oly shoes).  Unsurprisingly though, this specific bit of flexibility in that specific movement pattern wasn't enough for a sport with contact, rapid changes of direction, and rapid acceleration.  It wasn't even enough to run with any kind biomechanical efficiency.  It was enough to squat, bench press and deadlift though, which is the sport I was training.  That's all I'm driving at here."
AdvancedFitness,2hjt0q,dbilz,1 point,Sat Sep 27 17:53:57 2014 UTC,"The squat is an assessment used as part of a screening process. It helps show the movement capabilities of the person in question.  e.g. the over head squat. If you cannot comfortably get into the bottom possible, with a stick over midline, it shows how limited your upper back mobility is(among other things). Knowing this helps address risk of injury and where the issue lies.  Getting better at overhead squatting won't directly make you a better rower but if you cannot perform one to a certain degree of efficiency, you will be at a higher risk of injury while rowing."

He just says that this is what healthy tissues allow and that everyone should work on their tissues to further this stance.  He never recommends that you should stretch at a ROM that you cannot control. In every single video, he recommends that you need to actively contract and relax muscles in the ROM you can achieve to access past it. In the majority of his videos, he talks about motor control instead of flexibility or stretching.  It is a bit daunting to see pictures of him doing things that the majority of individuals cannot do. But for me, I see it as a challenge to try and get to that point over the next few years of my life. It might also help that I have a keen interest in this stuff as it does transfer over to performance in the gym.

This pic is from a static stretch on Mobility Wod - I'm dubious of the actual validity of doing such things in order to 'un-glue' tight soft tissue.    “…there is no research which proves categorically that there is any need for separate stretching sessions, phases or exercises to be conducted to improve performance or safety.” Dr. Mel Siff,  Supertraining    I believe many cross-fitters and gym-goers follow Dr. Starrett's advice (much of it is very good) without fully understanding the concepts. He recommends this static stretch (he says hold for 2 minutes) for individuals who have short illpsoas/rec femoris ...or anybody who sits a lot.

And never go past the point of which they can control.  That being said Starrett also advocates this and myofacial release protocols.  That is great. He is a DPT and I'm sure he could school me on many facets of mobility work, among other things. However, he clearly advocates a 2 minute static stretch for this and many other positions.

AdvancedFitness,2hfevz,HonkyTonkHero,0,Thu Sep 25 17:12:29 2014 UTC,"So most people can't kneel on the ground and then stand up? 160 degrees flexion in the knee is pretty damn basic I thought.   If you want to make this stretch less dependant on knee flexion you can come away from the wall, have the lower leg flat along the ground and move the hips while keeping upright."

AdvancedFitness,2hfevz,TheDude1985,1 point,Thu Sep 25 17:46:32 2014 UTC,"This stretch can also be modified by lowering the back foot. My PT has me doing this a lot and started me pretty low on the back foot with progressive raising.  To make it more difficult down the road, you rest the front foot on an elevated surface. Once the two upper legs get close to 180 degrees, you start extending the front leg while maintaining that upper-leg angle.  Plenty of modifications available here."

AdvancedFitness,2hfevz,terraburn,0,Thu Sep 25 20:12:31 2014 UTC,"If it works for you, that's great. But this analysis says there's not really any evidence that stretching provides much benefit: http://saveyourself.ca/articles/stretching.php.    However, for many people, a diligent effort over a period of weeks might modestly increase your range of motion. And more extreme efforts tend to produce more extreme results. Acrobats, gymnasts, yogis, contortionists, and martial artists have clearly been pushing the limits for centuries, sometimes achieving uncanny mobility. But these are highly motivated athletes with specific and exotic performance goals and stretching regimens that would definitely intimidate the rest of us, and with good reason: they often injure themselves along the way. Indeed, it may even be necessary to injure joints — to traumatize their capsules and ligaments — in order to get them to move that far.   And even if you do improve flexibility, he makes the claim that flexibility doesn't provide any benefits in terms of performance, injury reduction, etc.   There is no known benefit to greater flexibility, except for: bragging rights, dominating Twister tournaments, making full use of Indian love manuals."
AdvancedFitness,2hfevz,mrcosmicna,3,Thu Sep 25 20:51:24 2014 UTC,"You're confusing normal range of motion with extreme flexibility. Most people in our society have joints that can't even get within normal ranges of motion. In fact, the only people I've assessed who usually have optimal range of motion for function are people who frequently stretch."
AdvancedFitness,2hfevz,terraburn,1 point,Fri Sep 26 05:40:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but he's wrong. You gotta be flexible to kick someone taller than you in the head.   I guess it's sport specific."

If not for those convenient fitted lines, why, I'd say there's absolutely no trend whatsoever! Especially considering n=14.  It would have been interesting if they'd given data for subjects grouped by starting serum ferritin. 30-100 µg·L−1 is a large range. Granted, the entire range is generally considered normal, but optimal levels may vary per person (maybe I'm making a giant assumption?). If anything conclusive actually took place in this study, it might have been detectable in the people starting around 30 as opposed to the ones starting at 100. Of course, then the study would just be another on the massive research heap showing that if you're deficient in something, supplementing it helps (ZMA studies on men deficient in zinc or magnesium anyone?

I doubt there have been many studies on particular new and uncommon training philosophies, but they likely do have some benefit for grappling training. Specifically, alligator walking trains one to keep a low torso while manipulating the limbs, as one should do in situations like side control when you're trying to avoid having your opponent slip in a knee shield or otherwise transition to half-guard. Similarly, monkey walking is a decent approximation of the hip mechanics of a short shot or turning the corner, both of which are useful in certain situations.  It's often just much easier to call it ""alligator walk"" than to say, ""Warm up with the bottoming-down drill for side and north-south control."" Optimally, a coach would be able to use the familiarity with these warmups to cue certain sport-specific mechanics (e.g., ""Block their hips from turning in by alligator walking into them and putting your knee a little under their butt""), but many coaches don't get that far and many trainees don't make the connection."

AdvancedFitness,2h682x,Dismantlement,1 point,Sun Sep 28 19:35:56 2014 UTC,"I got a caffeine protocol from an AFL coach in Australia. For a Saturday game, the players have no caffeine from Tuesday midday and have up to 600mg of caffeine (although mostly 200-400mg) in the couple of hours prior to the game.

AdvancedFitness,2h682x,DieMafia,2,Tue Sep 23 16:45:54 2014 UTC,"No worries, even most people who speak English as their first language often conflate the two conditions. To put it in more proper terms, addiction is essentially an intense and continual psychological drive to consume a substance (or engage in a behavior) despite negative consequences to the user and despite numerous past attempts to cut down. Dependence is a physiological desensitized response to a neurochemical that requires the person to progressively increase their intake of a substance to get the same effect. Virtually all addictive substances also induce dependence, but caffeine induces dependence without causing addiction. Hence my comment about sucking dicks for coffee. If someone were deprived of coffee, they'd have a few mopey days where they felt a bit groggy and de-energized, but they'd get over it without having to deal without distracting cravings for caffeine, or feeling motivated to do crazy shit for a cup of coffee. They wouldn't break into a Starbucks, or OD on caffeine pills, or any of the other routine things that a meth or alcohol addict does to get his/her fix."
AdvancedFitness,2h682x,nukefudge,2,Tue Sep 23 17:10:25 2014 UTC,"alright, so what should my sentence be? ""caffeine is dependency-inducing""?  i feel like we're leaving out a lot of nuance in distinguishing so clear-cut between addiction and dependence. there's gotta be more of a transition available.  also, now that i think about it, is it common for caffeine depence to require continuous use of high dosages? i know from myself that a couple of liters of diet coke over a day doesn't really cause anything in particular (anecdotally, there's been some sleep issues at times, but it could be from other stuff), and that i've never had withdrawal symptoms when moving to products without caffeine. yet some people feel like shit until they get their first cup of strong coffee in the morning, right?"
AdvancedFitness,2h682x,stewer69,2,Tue Sep 23 17:25:39 2014 UTC,"Maybe caffeine can induce withdrawal symptoms? These IMO can happen without a craving for the substance, e.g. there are withdrawal symptoms when people stop smoking as well but also a psychological craving for the nicotine."
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,DPTFit,16,Mon Sep 22 12:56:38 2014 UTC,"I get a feeling of decompression during hanging leg raises that I don't get from sit-ups or crunches. It feels especially nice after a heavy deadlift session (think >10 reps over 600 lbs). Whether or not it actually functions as autotraction with all of the musculature contracting to counteract the stretch from the weight of my legs, I don't know. I would think that having that stretch would reduce some of the compressive forces on the IVDs, but I don't know if the muscle contraction overcomes the tension enough for this to not matter. But it feels better than any other option after a particularly heavy session.  I feel it more in my rectus than in my hip flexors, as subjective as that is. I'll also concede that it may simply be that taking my paraspinals through unloaded/reciprocally inhibited ROM that feels nice.  I refuse to do them in those inclined captain's chair things, though. Hyperextension injury waiting to happen."
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,failon,5,Mon Sep 22 13:32:43 2014 UTC,"Surprisingly, I feel it more in more core as well! But I know that just feeling a burn isn't always the whole story. As I feel a burn with crunches, but I know the load on my core is relatively light and not actually working that hard.   I did not think about the decompression effect, though that's a great point and exactly the type of comment I was hoping to hear. This is something I hope others will continue to expand upon, as well as share any other insights.    I will add, some believe that extreme flexion and the inhibition of spinal extensors could actually increase the risk of injury. I've only linked one article (http://www.clinbiomech.com/article/S0268-0033(03)00166-9/abstract?cc=y) but there are others out there. Don't know if I fully agree, but it's a thought.   This fact alone makes a lot of sense though. Repeated flexion activities mainly has a risk to the discs. (Which is made much worse under heavy load). If we do have some decompression at the same time as the flexion, we can assume the risk is at least decreased. I guess we still must consider the stretch to the anulus though. As well as once you hit 90* and beyond, the decompression may be lost at this point?"
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,failon,5,Mon Sep 22 14:00:09 2014 UTC,"It would be interesting to investigate the load on the annulus when the spine is under axial compression and tension while undergoing flexion/extension cycles and see how much of a difference the reflexive/protective contraction of the musculature makes on how the forces are distributed. Or even to what extent the paraspinals are inhibited by a flexion pattern under tension.  I do know that at least some of the core contraction is reflexive when hanging from a bar. I've had complete paraplegic patients (T4ish) doing pull-ups and getting strong contraction of rectus and obliques, where nothing but that tension has ever reliably produced a contraction in the core (no other exercises anyway, FES will work but I don't count it here)."
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,failon,3,Mon Sep 22 14:43:43 2014 UTC,"http://www.cybexintl.com/free-weights-leg-raise-chair.aspx  Old versions of this used to have the back vertical instead of tilted, and they felt fine. These, your legs can still accelerate back and down once you've reached the bottom of the movement, but your back/sacrum is locked and can't go back with the legs, potentially leading to a hyperextension injury.  My gym also has some with bosu balls in place of the back rest, and those actually feel really nice in comparison."
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,nigelregal,1 point,Mon Sep 22 14:14:15 2014 UTC,I use my gyms bosu ball one and find it really nice for greater ROM but it is a bit small for taller dudes. I'm only 6'1 and my feet can brush the ground sometimes.   I do them after deadlifts as well and find it feels nice.

AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,failon,2,Mon Sep 22 18:55:40 2014 UTC,Do you get the same feeling from just hanging there with your legs down? I do that from time to time and it feels pretty good to me.
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,boojieboy,3,Mon Sep 22 19:23:36 2014 UTC,"No, probably because I'm not taking my paraspinals through any range of motion with a static hang.  I have been known to use both the decline sit-up bench and 45 degree back extension for autotraction both passively and with pelvic tilt stuff, but only when I'm injured."
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,goatchop41,8,Mon Sep 22 13:53:51 2014 UTC,"My thing about the hanging leg raise is that everybody seems to think that this exercise targets the abs, while my understanding is that it's really more for the iliopsoas with the abs involved secondarily, if you add a little waist flex in the middle of it. Which makes sense when you think about the mechanics of the movement.   So I do the hanging leg raise a lot in the off-season when I'm not training for races, because that is an exercise that will help you drive the knees when you're climbing hills or trying to kick, but the idea that it's for abs is just...off.    Or am I relying on the wrong source here?"
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,failon,4,Mon Sep 22 14:36:30 2014 UTC,"I enjoy reading ExRx a lot. But, they are like wikipedia of fitness. They have great conversation starters, but rarely show the whole story. They have a really great article on only needing two sets of any exercise. They reference a ton of articles. Though, if you dig deeper, both in those articles, but a lot of current research as well, their position is highly speculative.   So, on topic, how I see the hanging leg raise, movement done with spine neutral and legs up to ~80 degrees flexion, depending on the person, is emphasizing the hip flexors, while movement above this (up to the those you do toes to bar or bows to toes, etc.) is shifting emphasis to rectus. There's no arguing the core is working at all stages, also from some of the stabilizing requirements, but I don't know others' opinions on the matter yet. :-)"
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,boojieboy,5,Mon Sep 22 13:08:23 2014 UTC,"I feel that if we consider the muscles at play here, and it will tell you why you feel the abdominals working hard. And the answer may not be that it is concentrically contracting.  Initially, iliopsoas contracts to flex the hips. Now because of the considerable weight of the legs compared to the lumbar spine, it is more likely that you will see a closed chain movement occur. This means that when bilateral iliopsoas contraction occurs, it will use the heavier (and therefore more stable) femurs as a base and pull the lumbar spine into extension. To counteract this and produce the desired movement, your rectus and obliques should contract, stabilising the lumbar spine and allowing iliopsoas to now use it as a stable base to move the legs from. I fell that this is a solid biomechanical explanation"
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,Ewitsallsticky,2,Mon Sep 22 13:13:44 2014 UTC,"This makes sense. Core is isometrically maintaining lordosis, which would even give some people a more appropraite reason to call this a ""functional exercise"" almost, if you care about that kind of thing."

AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,Wafflecone416,1 point,Tue Sep 23 03:43:23 2014 UTC,"This is one of the few correct comments here. It is dependent on what you're consciously using, along with the degree to which your spine is moving.   Your iliopsoas will not cause lordosis of your spine, except through momentum they generate. With the iliopsoas starting the movement, I can get an AWESOME contraction of my rectus with a powerful leg raise. I see comments stating that abs are out of the question here...you clearly either have very poor lower abdominal innervation or are not attempting to lift your legs higher than 80-90 degrees."
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,yeabubu,3,Mon Sep 22 13:51:59 2014 UTC,"I used to have a groin injury and sometimes I still feel a little burn after a 2 hour long hockey training. Having said that, I can really feel the iliopsoas contracting on a (hanging) leg raise where I won't feel it on a normal crunch.   So from my perspective the leg raises are a superior exercise if you are looking to build a more solid core for sports like football or running. However, it never hurts to target multiple muscle groups."
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,rantifarian,1 point,Thu Sep 25 19:21:03 2014 UTC,Keeping the legs straight helps me focus on using my abs.
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,nukefudge,1 point,Mon Sep 22 14:01:31 2014 UTC,"If you're doing them properly then your abs should be contracting isometrically throughout the entire set. Then you get the slight spinal flexion during each rep where you really squeeze your rectus. The combination of constant isometric contraction mixed with an isotonic contraction really activates your rectus.  It's subjective and not entirely accurate way to measure it's effectiveness, but I've never had my hip flexors fatigue before my abs do while doing this exercise. It's very much an abdominal exercise in my mind."
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,nukefudge,2,Mon Sep 22 17:04:48 2014 UTC,"gymnasts do a lot of different stuff with extreme spinal flexion and compression, (example) and i think they have few back problems."
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,nukefudge,3,Mon Sep 22 23:35:44 2014 UTC,"That's probably true. I know many gymnasts also have some level of hypermobility as well, even in the video you see his elbow hyperextension at the end. Anyone can argue chicken or egg here (do they train mobility or gymnasts with hypermobility excel). But that is still good anecdotal evidence to support less worry about unloaded spinal flexion. Thanks."
AdvancedFitness,2h4ety,rantifarian,2,Mon Sep 22 20:39:53 2014 UTC,"I am an ex gymnast, and used to see quite a few others when I was doing adult rec gym. Most of us had some sort of shoulder hypermobility or instability problem, and a lot of the girls had elbow issues too. They have stopped doing a lot of the things we used to as too dangerous. I can't think of anyone with back problems though, possibly due to the ridiculous amount of middle body training done  Hanging leg raise was never used as an ab exercise, always hip flexor or as part of the skills progression. Control on the lowering section is emphasised, so no raising legs and then flopping down, which may be an issue if you are using it with general population."

It's kind of difficult to get at with a traditional foam roller, especially if you're doing it by yourself. You use the shin of one leg to smash the back of the other leg.  Or are you asking why you might want to smash any sort of muscle? Look in to foam rolling. Rolling, smashing, etc is a way to break up a muscle, similar to a massage, but something you can do yourself."

AdvancedFitness,2h2975,nednerbf,2,Mon Sep 22 10:14:00 2014 UTC,"Think of what muscles are, a bound of tubes that contract and relax to move a joint. Now there are bundles of tubes within bundles of tubes and what holds all these tubes rogether in a nice bundle is connective tissue. When the muscle stays immobile for too long the connective tissue becomes nasty and matted down by the lack of hydration. This causes something called fibrosis to occur in the muscle.  Now what is this fibrosis causing in the muscle? Its reducing the muscles ability to stretch and contract properly because there is a ton of tension in muscle tissue already. Feeding some slack into the system will allow whatever that muscle is pulling on to release. Bye bye knee pain and back pain.  To remove this fibrosis, you need to change the relationship between the muscle itself and the tissue around it. How do you do that? Get a massage, cupping... or jam a lacrosse ball or other fixed object into that tissue and move the pressure ACROSS the tissue. this localises the pressure on the tissue and breaks up that fibrosis. There is a canadian PT that has a video on youtube where he explains why the standard foam rolling you see most people do is NOT myofascial release. If you watch kstarrs vids or have read his book you will notice he often speaks about rolling across the grain of the tissue to break it up.  Breaking up that tissue also allows hydration to get back in the muscle and tissue as well, thats why after a massage, the therapist normally tells you to drink lots of water."

This causes something called fibrosis to occur in the muscle.   You aren't wrong, but fibrosis is a pathological state so you're using fibrosis in the wrong context. People considering this technique are more likely to have adhesions than fibrosis.  Fibrosis is pathologic and represents scar tissue that will not be alleviated by massage, foam roll, or other manual technique. It is more likely to develop after an injury or by chronic non-use, such as inappropriate casting, rather than not stretching appropriately. What you are looking for is adhesion#Pathophysiology). While the wiki identifies adhesion as post-injury, it then acknowledges that adhesion can form post-inflammation e.g. exercise. Additionally, muscle smashing produces a prolonged stretch on the myotendinous unit, activating the Golgi tendon organ (GTO) and causing a spinal reflex that relaxes the muscle. The GTO reflex will allow a muscle with high resting tone (knots, tightness) but no other restrictions to relax and release, giving greater dorsiflexion range of motion."

AdvancedFitness,2gwdle,Mister_Cupcake,9,Fri Sep 19 21:42:24 2014 UTC,Id argue some of these are mobility drills but nevertheless I agree that it's better to do more functional work than some of the crazy shit you see by the mobility guys (barring injuries of course)  I will highlight that as a sprint sport athlete (rugby) the side lunges are hugely valuable in determining if my hips are locked/fucked/not functioning etc. Ive done those for years and as he says you can tell right away there's a problem.   Before I was self aware of my hip problems I had issues with frequent hamstring strains and ankle rolls.

You can't use stiff legged deadlifts as a mobility exercise if you don't have the mobility to do them in the first place.  Also, same goes with BNP.  Dislocations I find are just terrible and injurious for most people who don't already have the range of motion to do them.    Mobility and strength are tied together.  When you strengthen some muscles too much and neglect (accidnetally or on purpose) others, you become immobile in some capacity.  I have done 0 stretching or mobility work for my hips.  My squat's gotten deeper with a straight back by learning to brace better, strengthening my abs and deep bracing muscles, and utilizing my lats better.  Stability paves the way to mobility, not doing exercise that one should already have a decent amount of mobility to do."
AdvancedFitness,2gwdle,HMNbean,1 point,Sat Sep 20 05:06:10 2014 UTC,"You could use stiff legs as a mobility exercise, infact they maybe perfect in that you can really control the ROM depending on the size box you use. Let's say you started from an 1/8 on an inch box, you would hardly know it then in the next two weeks or a month you make it a 1/4, it will be no time before you're capable to do a few inches.  Dislocations are not terrible, you just need a longer pole and build the mobility in the shoulders.  I always start my friends at the maximum ends of the pole then after a few sets work them in some more and more until they reach their limit with good form. From here you should be able to BTN press no problem.  But i do agree however about the bracing and core work, its very important and should be priority for most."

This could also be achieved with SL deadlifts, though, as another user has pointed out. This cannot just be done from deficient to begin with. Mobility has to be achieved in smaller ranges of motion, allowing for continued good form, prior to reach deficients, if that is ever even possible."

That said, it's all well and good that lactic acid isn't causing me muscle failure when I'm cycling, but then why is the burning in the legs and the muscle failure so correlated.? Also, why does training at lactate threshold (supposedly to train the bodies ability to process lactic acid) work as intended if the clearing of lactic acid isn't the limiting factor we once thought it was?  (I'm not just posing questions, if anyone has any ideas, I'd love to hear them)"
AdvancedFitness,2gtciv,Gymrat777,3,Fri Sep 19 03:24:00 2014 UTC,"I think your assumptions are based off of 2 false premises.  First, that lactic acid causing a burning feeling (it says acid right?!).  It would be more important to look at cellular pH levels and lactic acid to even establish a corollary.  Secondly, you would need some direct evidence that pH is the mechanism (will a buffer stop the burning feeling, will an acid increase it, etc).  As far as I know not many studies look at the 'burning' feeling, though there are those that look at muscle pH as a function of exercise.  The second premise is that if an intended action works, it is because it works through the intended mechanism.  If I plan to work at my 'lactate threshold' that will improve it.  Well by working at that level which other systems are being stressed.  How do those systems play into the threshold.    I think a lot of false premises are based of the idea that lactic acid is working as an acid in the muscle.  pdf warning.  Muscle doesn't change in pH that dramatically in response to exercise.  The pH change does confer several changes though (for instance it helps release oxygen from hemoglobin in muscle tissue).  It may help you think of it instead of as lactic acid, as lactate.    I may not have answered your question (I need to re-review the lactate literature) but I hope that I have given you a little more information."

In regards to both of the false assumptions you mention, my questions are more ""if it's not lactic acid, then what is the other mechanism at play"".

Again, I will just give you some more information that you hopefully find useful but I can't answer your question yet (reviewing lactate is on my things to do)  But on that note, exercise physiology has the benefit over other systems in that the outcome is easily assayed (it isn't like cancer where you have to justify giving someone a drug that might save their life vs another drug that we have no idea bout).  So not only can we look at the underlying mechanisms we can simply look at end goal (improved performance).  To that end there are many studies that look at performance one way or another and more importantly you can do these studies on your self (though obviously not scientific they can still be meaningful).

This study basically gives some mechanistic insight into exactly how AAS use can contribute to tissue damage that is often seen.  A couple of thoughts, though:  Maybe I'm wrong for even thinking like this, however, perhaps this implies that small doses, such as slightly above normal levels (obviously normal levels imply, but maybe SLIGHT supraphysiological levels would be best), it would induce a mitohormetic response, augmented lifespan/longevity via these same outlined mechanisms. This study and a study cited in this paper note that the ROS prod is overproduced w/ respsect to the activity of the antioxidant systems.. however, smaller amounts of ROS signaling and general body stressors and can often induce mitohormesis, whereby your body becomes more robustly stress resistant by ramping up antioxidant defense capacities through a positive ROS signaling. This could also explain why men that go on TRT-esque doses most often become healthier.  My hypothesis may be supported by a few studies too:  ""Testosterone increases renal anti-aging klotho gene expression via the androgen receptor-mediated pathway."" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163025  &  ""The Neuroprotective Effect of Klotho is Mediated via Regulation of Members of the Redox System"" http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2014/07/18/jbc.M114.567321  Thus, testosterone - androgen receptor interaction signaling induces expression of the anti-aging gene/protein Klotho.. and Klotho is known to exert much of its protective and longevity benefitting effect through the redox system, the same one that is disrupted in the study from very high doses.   Notwithstanding, perhaps the positive effects of testosterone are mediated most optimally, already, at the normal physiological level."

AdvancedFitness,2gmk1k,SlayerSBoxxy,1 point,Mon Sep 29 11:32:19 2014 UTC,"Well, first do you have some sort of an endurance goal or do you simply like to stay fit? If you want to gain strength and prepare for a marathon at the same time the answer becomes quite more complicated.  I'd say that the most taxing 'cardio' work in regards to your gym gains would be the harder/longer steady state (SS) training sessions, i.e. a 10k run with your heart rate (HR) hovering around 140-160+bmp for the whole time. I subscribe to the idea that if you're a strength athlete (or someone aspiring to be more gym-centric), you'll get the most benefit from doing really easy cardio and really hard HIIT, but nothing inbetween.   I'd do 1-2 easy SS sessions a week, with the goal of trying to max my HR at 120-130bpm and aiming for 25-45 minutes per session. If this was low-impact, such as rowing, swimming or biking, all the better. Then I'd also do 1 really hard HIIT session as well.  This way you're upkeeping your vo2max/absolute performance with the HIIT and also keeping your aerobic base in check with the easy SS. The easy SS can also enhance your recovery."

Doing triathlons I kind of see this in a different way.. say I really want to spend 3 months getting faster at running, I may put my bike or swim in maintenance mode where I don't try to improve it, just try to minimize losses.  I don't think there is ever a way to perfectly balance out and stay the same at something. You can either improve or get worse at something. BUT, the rate at which you get worse is very different if you compare sitting on a couch with 1-2 sessions a week.  I don't really do any of the HIIT stuff, so I can't help you with your specific questions. But as a starting point, you could do half of what you normally do (say half the sessions, keep the sessions the same difficulty).

Having had a herniated disc and having a wife who does NOT have herniated discs but constantly complains of back pain, I can say with some certainty that pain is not always a good indicator of disc problems. Some people have such a low pain threshold that they think things are wrong when they are just sore. Others have such a high one that even doctors don't find the problem because they think ""If that was the problem, this guy would be screaming"". I fit the latter category, as I went for 2 months with the herniation and subsequent nerve damage and all the docs I saw dismissed that as the problem due to the fact I wasn't in more obvious pain.

That being said, it's also less fun than doing high carb, or a balanced approach. Ultimately, as the other poster said, it's gonna be up to you to figure out what you prefer.   I would absolutely consume high Gi carbs after the workout. Supposedly it isn't a big deal, but I can really feel the difference between doing 60g simple carbs and fast-digesting protein post workout vs not. The carbs really help get the protein in there and speed my recovery- or so it feels like, anyways.

AdvancedFitness,2g4bty,glamdivitionen,7,Fri Sep 12 11:24:07 2014 UTC,"Dietary questionnaires provided sodium intake from foods. Salt consumption was reported by multiplying sodium consumption by 2.54. Moreover, in order to take into account addition of salt during cooking and eating, 1.5g of salt per day was added to estimate total salt consumption as advised by a French nutrition agency   So salt intake is self reported which is notoriously hard to come to ground breaking conclusions on, but on top of that they are adding a value to everyone regardless of what they report because a nutrition agency said thats how people eat. but we'll get to this further down.   Salt intake was positively associated with SBP in men but not in women   The data also shows that women ate 2 grams less of salt per day than men did. I don't know if you have a girlfriend, or a wife, but i can tell you that my diet is almost identical to my fiancee. When i go out to eat with my friends the women do not in general pick foods that are going to contain significantly less salt. I see this as a self reporting issue.   Nevertheles, hypertensive participants consumed salt at a significantly higher rate than did those who were non-hypertensive. Several hypotheses can explain this finding. First, in our study, people who were treated with antihypertensive drugs and who could have a greater salt consumption were excluded. This may have led to minimization of the salt consumption range and, thus, the expected association. Second, dietary questionnaires covered only sodium intake from foods; total consumption was estimated by adding a constant for cooking meals and eating, which could have reduced the interindividual variation and hence, made the potential association more difficult to identify.   The article itself says that there are huge gaps. Adding an arbitrary value to come to ""total sodium consumption"" mixed with cutting out a big chuck of your salt eating population amounts to these findings meaning almost nothing.  There are hundreds of studies showing a connection between BP and sodium intake. Then this study, a cross-sectional self reported study, that has maybe 3 paragraphs on what they found with salt intake and Time magazine says ""Salt Doesn’t Cause High Blood Pressure?"" And the OP makes a title of ""No association between salt and blood pressure""  This is simply not the case."

Asking ""Salt Doesn't Cause High Blood Pressure?"" is not the most horrible title Time could have used (I've come to expect the worst from media reporting of science, and frankly this one is pretty tame).

AdvancedFitness,2fx1l9,Strikerrjones,1 point,Thu Sep 11 02:04:09 2014 UTC,"What do you find flawed about TUT in general though? It certainly augments metabolic stress, a large contributing factor to the process of hypertrophy. The buildup of metabolites has proven to make a significant impact on hypertrophy.. which can be seen manifested via different training modalities. Not getting into the calculations or post at all.. just the premise behind TUT. For instance, the increased acidity seen amplifies the level of micro-tear and general membrane perturbations, challenging cellular integrity more. These are modulations that boost the typical hypertrophy response that typically occurs via mechanotransduction and cytokine/growth factor signaling. Volume is still the #1 component of growth (apart from the obvious lifting at a certain intensity % just to stimulate all MUs), and higher reps and thus higher TUT have robust contributions as to why."
AdvancedFitness,2fx1l9,Strikerrjones,5,Thu Sep 11 02:44:50 2014 UTC,"You don't get metabolic stress from increased TUT, you get it from the formation of cross-bridges. The more cross-bridges form at the same time, the higher the H+ concentration becomes, and when you have decreased blood flow like during a resistance training set, this creates metabolic stress and anaerobic fatigue.   Jogging for three miles has enormously more TUT than any resistance training session, but it yields almost no muscle growth except in sedentary people. The key is anaerobic fatigue due to metabolite concentration, and during aerobic exercise, you don't get the metabolite build-up, just metabolite production that's quickly dealt with via blood flow.  One way to approximate metabolite build-up is to take a set to failure. When using different loads across sets, you can assume that an approximately equal level of anaerobic fatigue is occurring so long as the sets are taken to failure, and thus equal hypertrophy is stimulated (less metabolite concentration is necessary to create fatigue with a heavier load compared to a lighter load, but looking at the research, this doesn't seem to matter - which to me means that there's a threshold for maximum hypertrophy stimulation, and doing more doesn't produce more hypertrophy). This is actually reflected in all the research I've found comparing an approximately equal number of sets to failure with different loads. Different rep ranges yield vastly different TUT, but the underlying mechanism, metabolite concentration, is the same so long as the effort per set is similar. Give me a few minutes and I'll go post all the research.

And no, I can't agree with a notion of a vastly heavier load being equivalent. Again, the energy pathway and metabolic stress is entirely different and the far heavier load is primarily a neural component. It's platitudinous, but you can see this exemplified from bodybuilders vs powerlifters or strongmen. The sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is mainly augmented, which induces hyp of various non contractile elements, such as titin, desmin, dystrophin, collagen, myomesmins, etc plus more water and glycogen storage/accretion. Please, I implore you, stop babbling like you know what you're talking about. If the loads were vastly different and ergo the rep ranges, TUT, metabolic stress and volume, it's completely different, as I said from diff energy pathway stimulation to a certain extent. Btw, it's not the H+ that plays the integral role of promoting membrane rupturing, that manifests as the burn intracellularly, but the lactic acid accumulation extracellularly that contributes more."

Again, the energy pathway and metabolic stress is entirely different and the far heavier load is primarily a neural component.   No it isn't. Hypertrophy is equal, and neural adaptations between rep ranges are different. Lifting 10 reps makes your nervous system mostly better at 10 reps, lifting 3 reps makes your nervous system mostly better at 3 reps.   When you lift a very heavy weight, you blast through the ATP stores and creatine phosphate much more quickly than if you were lifting a lighter load. If you hit failure, you're using a lot of glycolysis to make ATP.   It's platitudinous, but you can see this exemplified from bodybuilders vs powerlifters or strongmen.   No you don't, at least in drug-free competitive bodybuilders, powerlifters, and weightlifters:   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14666943  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9134368  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12741885  The fiber types of all three are nearly identical, and that's in populations that self-select for certain fiber type ratios.   The sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is mainly augmented, which induces hyp of various non contractile elements, such as titin, desmin, dystrophin, collagen, myomesmins, etc plus more water and glycogen storage/accretion.   Please, please provide me with some evidence that higher rep ranges increase titin, desmin, etc. Titin in muscle fibers is associated with myosin heavy chains. When you get more titin, you get more heavy chains with it. That's not ""sarcoplasmic hypertrophy"", which in itself is some pretty spectacular broscience unsupported by any real evidence. Sarcoplasm does increase volume, but in proportion to contractile elements, regardless of rep range. It can increase independently with glycogen storage, but that is not hypertrophy, unless glycogen depletion counts as atrophy, in which case people can gain and lose 20+ pounds of muscle in 24 hours.    Please, I implore you, stop babbling like you know what you're talking about.   You seem to be kind of butthurt about this. Are you the guy who did all that useless math?   Btw, it's not the H+ that plays the integral role of promoting membrane rupturing, that manifests as the burn intracellularly, but the lactic acid accumulation extracellularly that contributes more.   The role of lactic acid in hypertrophy is still under question, but to be fair, so are H+ ions from cross-bridging. It makes sense to me that both contribute a bit, as lactate will (minimally) increase acidity and the H+ ions have to be transported out of the cell at some point. Again, look at occlusion training with light loads."
AdvancedFitness,2fx1l9,Monkar,-3,Thu Sep 11 22:52:48 2014 UTC,"First point - no, there's no accretion of metabolites with running, as you noted yourself they're clear. Occlusion training is a special case because the metabolites profoundly accumulate and hypoxia/occlusion have a known role in hypertrophy.. not to mention the recent evidence (in vitro, after all) that transient glucose deprivation from training induced venous and arterial compression also help induce mTOR via NO stimulation.. another form of metabolic stress that would be strongly augmented via occlusion training.   Yes, I did look at them, but I didn't want to think you were that stupid to think they mimicked a realistic workout protocol. There's a combination of the loads being EXTREMELY disparate and use of training-naive subjects. Can we get something realistic, using, I don't know at least 60% 1RM please? If you don't see the flaws, you're being delusional and biased but I'll help you see them anyway. The only study you posted that fits criteria is the first one. However, they can't be equated because, and I mean for god sakes.. the strength group lifted for what, over an hour? and the higher rep group was something like 17mins/session? Please. Still not indicative of a typical high volume bodybuilding-oriented training protocol. This brings me to another point: What you and others also don't realize is, when comparing a powerlifters routine, a strongman routine, and a bodybuilder routine, all will gain appreciable size of course.. but to really start seeing a major difference in terms of size, it's going to take a study longer than simply 1-3 months. That's why you see such immense differences after YEARS of comparisons in real life, but no study can realistically view that unfortunately so parrots will continue to pontificate their baseless and mechnistically false gobbledygook. It's quite unfortunate. People realize the nuances of muscle hypertrophy and can't see the simplest things.  The studies you posted here in terms of fiber types literally have no bearing on anything. It's well known bodybuilders and really weight-lifting in general will see a general trend toward increasing type IIa fibers. So? What I was talking about in that quote you used from my post was size differences, by the way.  As for sarcoplasmic gain, here is this: http://www.jissn.com/content/1/2/27   Just the intro is enough. Brad has also written many papers on hyp, as you know, and often suggests that of sarcoplasmic hyp. Here's two papers where he at least touches on them:   http://www.lookgreatnaked.com/articles/potential_mechanisms_for_%20a_role_of_metabolic_stress_in_hypertrophic_adaptations_to_resistance_training.pdf  http://www.lookgreatnaked.com/articles/mechanisms_of_muscle_hypertrophy.pdf  No I did not. And yes of course both contribute, I'm just pointing out the more integral role of extracellular accretion and subequent rupturing."

It's different for different people based on genetics (acromion type), amount of humeral retroversion, internal v external impingement, etc., etc.  Generally impingement as a pathology ""builds up"" over time.  The best way to keep the shoulders healthy is to avoid vulnerable positions under load and keep the upper back and external rotators strong.  The apprehension test for supraspinatus impingement is conducted with the humerus abducted to 90 degrees:  http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0515/p3079.html#afp20000515p3079-f3  Another reason to avoid rear delt rows, laterals past 90 degrees abduction, etc.  It's a very vulnerable position."

Rows aren't the same deal because you're scapulae aren't pinned against a bench and have the freedom to move so the arthokinematics of the shoulder would be slightly different. You can also externally rotate on rows which is a bad idea on bench. Bench is an extreme because of the mechanics of the movement allow for loading in a potentially very precarious position.  Rear delt rows should be fine if you have non-pathological shoulders, but I will add that normal rowing/chinning patterns hit the rear delts and let you use more weight, so I don't think it's that necessary.  Face pulls are fine if you keep your hands above your head and keep the humerus in external rotation.    Anecdotally I have pretty bad shoulders and tend to avoid pec flyes/rear delt rows etc."

AdvancedFitness,2fmx0c,dpjoachim,2,Sat Sep 6 13:37:51 2014 UTC,"I was taught from Verkhoshansky and Siff as well and used accelerometers measuring it with depth drops and cmj. It's completely attainable in those movements.   Which are you thinking in particular?   Edit: Here is a study talking about reducing GCT:   In the present study, the DJ test typically involved ground contact times shorter than 250 ms, which would be expected to involve relatively high eccentric loads (Young et al., 1999). Therefore, a relatively high level of MTEN stiffness might be desirable for the DJ used in the present study for two reasons. First, in a DJ requiring high eccentric loads, a high level of preactivation of muscles before ground contact (and an associated high level of stiffness) is required to achieve a good rebound performance (Gollhofer & Kyrolainen, 1991; Komi, 1992). Second, a high level of MN stiffness would ensure fast transmission of muscular force to the bones, producing good explosive force production. A reduction in eccentric strength as a result of static stretching (Davies et al., 1992) is also consistent with the reduced DJ performance in the present study."
AdvancedFitness,2fmx0c,zortnarftroz,1 point,Sat Sep 6 17:23:51 2014 UTC,According to this study the static stretching increased the amortization times (yup) and PNFs and max isometric contractions had no positive or negative affect- but it seems to say a warm up jog is beneficial for shortening the ground times.  Interesting.    What I'm curious to find out is where the .2 second rule came from.  If I'm coaching an in-depth jump from a 60cm platform there is usually more ROM at the landing (as opposed to a 30cm jump) and consequently an increased amortization phase.  At .3 or .4 is the myotatic response mostly dissipated?
AdvancedFitness,2fmx0c,zortnarftroz,5,Sat Sep 6 18:53:23 2014 UTC,"You would want the athlete to work up to that depth. What I was taught was for the participant to mimic their mechanical pattern they would exhibit when jumping. So, don't go into deep flexion. Really focus on the eccentric component of it; after all you can only exert what you can absorb (3rd law of inertia).  So when you are increasing into the .3 or .4 sec you are losing some of the energy that was stored into the tendon during the SSC (as heat, if I remember correctly). This is why it's recommended to have decent rest breaks between even reps of this exercise to ensure flawless form and GCT is being exhbited."
AdvancedFitness,2fmx0c,Joshua_Naterman,2,Sat Sep 6 19:04:11 2014 UTC,"Yes. Working up is super important, as is mimicking the desired movement pattern. I love this conversation.  The entire point of plyometrics is to teach the body to produce higher peak and RMS forces within a given (or shorter) time period, and to do so rapidly. This requires tight control of the training stimulus, and extremely low repetitions per set. You aren't going to get pure power results with more than ~5 reps, but you can always use a force plate for really exact results. Once RMS power output has dropped a few percent compared to the earlier reps, or contact time has increased more than a few percent (say 5 as the cut off for an arbitrary but fairly meaningful point of reference) it is time for the set to end. If the first rep of the new set can't match or exceed the good reps of the first work set, the workout needs to be over. Anything below that will just teach a slightly different recruitment pattern, leading to suboptimal results.  Changing from 30 to 60 cm is a massive, massive increase in force. Higher in-depth jumps won't necessarily make an athlete a more powerful jumper.  Increases should be 1 cm at a time (small enough to not be noticeable by the athlete AND not have a significant change in performance in terms of RMS power or GCT), OR never increase height but have the athlete wear small amounts of added weight (like an extra half pound per week or something) and use the same rules to define when a work out ends.  You can always measure progress by returning to a few previous heights once per month and seeing what the RMS power and GCT look like. If RMS increases and GCT stays the same or decreases you're probably creating a more powerful athlete in that movement. Just decreasing GTC might mean your athlete is focusing on fast touches rather than max power generation.  Fine control of loading, and focusing on the explosive force into the ground instead of how fast the feet leave the ground, is essential to achieving the highest levels of success when you're looking for maximizing power output.   You really do need some kind of contact equipment to do this as well as possible, such as a force plate, but in its absence you can always have the athlete stop each set when they think, or you think, they are about to experience the slightest of decrease in power. You could also have them stop at the first rep they notice the slightest decrease in power or increase in contact time. They can always, always rest and do another set. That can continue until they feel, or discover from the first rep of the next set, that their next set just can't achieve the same performance, even if it's negligibly lower. It's not as informed since you are relying on the athlete instead of subjective data, but once athletes learn how to pay attention to themselves it works well."
AdvancedFitness,2fmx0c,zortnarftroz,2,Sun Sep 7 02:32:16 2014 UTC,"A great way to measure it is to have someone subjectively examine form. If it starts to get sloppy stop and rest for ~4 minutes and do another set.  Also, as a precursor to depth jumps I'd just start with depth drops where you land in the jumping position of ~30˚ hip flexion and ~40˚ish of knee flexion with arms extended back. Basically you're mimicking the bottom of a CMJ form. This will increase eccentric strength and is a great prerequisite to the depth jump itself."
AdvancedFitness,2fmx0c,Joshua_Naterman,2,Sun Sep 7 03:34:00 2014 UTC,Excellent advice. I hope OP is taking notes.
AdvancedFitness,2fmx0c,Joshua_Naterman,2,Sun Sep 7 08:14:00 2014 UTC,"I believe more recent research has suggested that myotatic reflex kicks in for 1-2 seconds, but the effect is smaller with longer amortization phases.  All you're really doing is manipulating the afferent feedback with a rapid length change so that the motor neurons are excited and the threshold potential is reduced, allowing greater recruitment with less biochemical effort from the motor neuron itself.  Slower length changes result in less powerful afferent feedback, leading to less excitation signalling, leading to a less powerful myotatic reflex.   The signals are very short term, and as the chemical gradients from the afferent inputs wear off and the motor neuron repolarizes, you lose the extra excitation and end up with no reflex at all after a short time.  That's essentially the underlying mechanism for why this works, what is happening, and why speed is important."
AdvancedFitness,2fomr4,Joshua_Naterman,15,Sun Sep 7 01:25:49 2014 UTC,"This is an unpublished, non-peer reviewed thesis paper from 2007.  Anything that isn't published wasn't good enough to be published. That's going to be a running theme for me, I can see: Not all science is good science. This definitely falls into that large, swirling pool of scientific putridity. Good idea, poor poor execution.  Major issues:   1) There was no mention of training the participants on the use of the jump measurement device, so there's no guarantee that everyone performed correctly during the tests.   2) No described standardization of squat technique for either variant.  Either of those two things alone invalidates the study. without express standardization, you can't make any specific claims because you did not control the exercise form or train people how to do it.  3) Quote:  lower body exercises used over the 8-week training period other  than the squat were the snatch, hang snatch, clean, hang clean, box step-up,  lateral step-up, good morning, reverse lunge, jump squat and stability ball leg curls.   OH MY GOD. 10 other leg exercises?!?! OF COURSE YOU SAW NO DIFFERENCE! Cleans include front squats, every single rep. Total confoundment right there. The end, but wait: there's more! (Don't worry Billy, I rock the beard too!) Good mornings mimic much of the back squat. Snatches also mimic high bar back squat body position but with the bar overhead. Jump squats... Oh, so you specifically trained the test too, basically? Once again, confound failure: this study is not about ANY OF THESE EXERCISES!!! The total volume of all this other leg work would make the squat variations themselves fairly negligible in impact, both because so many muscles are being maximally stimulated and because there is so much crossover between motor patterns and muscle function in many of these lifts vs the ""experimental lift.""  There may be others, I really didn't read the entire prospectus. These were enough for me to completely shrug this off and walk away.  Other issues: I'm not really sure how to classify these right now.   There was no mention of body segment variation and squat technique, no EMG data taken or used to back up assertions of similar muscular involvement (which we know is not really the case, there is considerably difference because of varying joint angles and thus actin-myosin overlap, requiring greater recruitment at greater muscle lengths for a given absolute external load)   Power index, a repeat of 4 jumps (3 of which are fully plyometric according to the description), is not really a sport specific measure of volleyball jumping. That's a single jump without the same degree of stretch reflex.  Again, there may be others, but this study is trash.  What they could have done is done another study with the same athletes (or another group, but the same athletes would have been awesome for consistency) and ONLY done one squat or the other as lower body work. Did that happen? Well, the author has 0 publications on pubmed. Bummer for them, I guess, because if they did something like this then that wasn't good enough to publish either."

Keeping my back as straight as possible a hard at times. When that happens I back off. I purposely increase the weight for dead lifts slowly for that reason. Hope that helps"

They essentially eliminate a lot of the spinal loading, as you don't need to use as much overall weight, while working your legs just as much, if not harder"

As a clinician myself (physiotherapist), I have to give you a little FYI - you can't 'dislocate' a disc. There are a few things that an intervertebral disc can do (protrude/extrude, etc), but as a fibrous structure that is attached to vertebrae, it isn't possible to dislocate them. I don't want to come off as an ass about it. Misinformation like that (and other crap like backs 'being out') is the bane of the modern clinician, and is usually disseminated by chiropractors"

Different foods will create different reactions.  Those hormones will go on to determine things like:   how and where that food is used and in turn how your metabolism will react.  Metabolism is calories out. how you feel - both mentally and physically.  If you feel good you'll probably be more active.  If you feel bad you'll probably loaf around.  Activity is calories out. how hungry you feel later and when, which brings us back to calories in.   And this is just scraping the surface of things.  CICO is an incredibly complex framework with countless variables all influencing one another.  It's constantly in flux.   But it is a holistic framework that encompasses everything because it has to."

AdvancedFitness,2fdbeg,siddster,0,Thu Sep 4 17:10:00 2014 UTC,"What's your point? Hormones and other such idiosyncratic variations manifest as differences in metabolic rate or staiety signaling amongst individuals. That still fits within the parameters of CICO, bar none. Thermodynamics is still the law, REGARDLESS of hormone differences, as if you eat less than your TDEE, you will burn fat. Period. That doesn't mean simply eating less than your TDEE on whatever macros is optimal, however.. though that still doesn't violate the 1st law of thermodynamics either. That's where TEF comes in, aka entropy manifest (2nd law)."
AdvancedFitness,2fdbeg,CSkip,12,Thu Sep 4 17:21:20 2014 UTC,"I posted this before in /r/science so you have been warned..   I cannot believe that a study with some serious and significant shortcomings/limitations is getting this much attention (especially on NYTimes). Most people talking about it clearly did not read the actual manuscript. Couple of salient points -   The low-carb group did not actually follow a low-carb diet. They were still consuming approximately 30-35% of their daily calories from carbohydrate  which is still 3 times the target goal (Table 2 - carb consumption was 127 gms/day in the low-carb group while the goal was to keep it at <40 grams/day). The low-fat diet was ~30% fat. This is barely lower than the 35% fat at baseline and certainly nowhere near the 20% threshold advocated by the DASH diet plan (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension). The dietary data are just plain awful. They used 24-hour recalls which are problematic and if you use the numbers published in table 2 you have caloric intake dropping from 1998 kcal to 1448 kcal in the low-carb group and it went from 2034 kcal/day to 1527 kcal/day in the low-fat group. If you do that math on the caloric deficit in the low-carb group the net caloric deficit was ~550kcal per day (1998-1448=550) which works out to be a 200,750 kcal total deficit over 365 days. This should have panned out to a 57 pound weight loss! Even if you factor in 50% adaptive thermogenesis they are nowhere near the amount of weight they should have lost in the first place. Mozaffarian in the NYtimes piece says this, ""“To my knowledge, this is one of the first long-term trials that’s given these diets without calorie restrictions.” This is patently absurd given the massive drops in caloric consumption seen in both groups! There is honestly no way of knowing how much these people were actually eating given the massive discrepancies in the reported consumption and actual weight loss. The following is a direct quote from the limitations section of the manuscript - ""dietitians were not blinded to the study hypothesis."" This is bad on many levels.. if the dietitians knew that the hypothesis was that low-carb would result in better weight loss outcomes they could have easily influenced the outcome of the study. Another thing that people are making too much of is the increased loss of fat and greater preservation of muscle mass in the low-carb group. This is nonsense given that body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance which is literally one of the worst measures for detecting change in body composition. Look at figure 3.. although BIA is good for single point measurements, when you look to assess change in fat free mass and % fat mass the correlation coefficients are poor (FFM - 0.3 = just 9% of the variance, %fat mass = 0.67 = just 40% of the variance).   Finally, the changes in Framingham risk scores were modest at best. Net change of 1.4% in risk scores which is of questionable significance (the authors mention this as well). I am just blown away by the coverage that this is getting....."
AdvancedFitness,2fdbeg,InspiredRichard,2,Thu Sep 4 23:27:31 2014 UTC,"Just had a chance to read the actual manuscript (figured I should since I am a nutrition grad student) and was shocked at how poorly designed the study was as well as the media's interpretation of it.   The biggest issue I have is that in essence it is comparing two diets, one that displayed a lot changed from the baseline diet in the form of reducing the total amount of carbs consumed and the other that displayed almost no change from baseline (lowered fat from about 35% to 30%). Where did the weight loss come from then? Easy if you look at table 2 in the paper the group on the low-carb diet actually consumed on average 200kcal less than the low-fat group."

AdvancedFitness,2fdbeg,broscientologist,1 point,Thu Sep 11 17:37:23 2014 UTC,"Here is my experiential, anecdotal evidence from my own (and my wifes) experience.  A few years back we tried a low-carb, high protein diet. We were both also trying to exercise a decent amount.  We both lost quite a bit of weight (I think I lost around 15kg), but by 8 or so weeks in we were both totally hating the food we had to eat, were craving sugars (we were even allowed to eat much fruit) and generally feeling depressed.  Around 5 weeks ago we went to a naturopath. Her advice can be summarised as 'eat whole foods - avoid all low fat options - avoid processed foods wherever possible'.   We have both lost around 6.5kg (I have put on muscle too as I have been weight training as well. She is not doing any exercise at the moment due to an injury) and are really enjoying the food we are eating. A lot of the foods we are eating include nuts and seeds now (I love the protein powder she advised - it just has a lot more depth to it than anything else I have tried).  Since we cut out the processed foods - chocolate, yoghurt, chips etc, we have stopped craving them. The fruit I eat gives me enough sugar and the protein powder contains raw cocoa. We both also feel fuller sooner and are 'naturally' eating smaller portions.  While we haven't been doing this particular method as long, it feels a lot more effective. We have lost probably slightly less weight for the same stage, but we are still enjoying our food, probably having a much healthier diet and have much better mood levels.  TL:DR;  For us, low carb lost us significant weight, but negatively affected us in other ways. Whole-foods/no processed foods also lost decent amounts of weight so far, but is a much more enjoyable (and probably sustainable) way to go."

The HFT group is, on average, both bigger and stronger than the LFT group.  As such, I'd have to know more about what was done in the study before putting much faith in the results.  If the groups were randomly assigned, the magnitude in the difference in means pre-study suggests small N's, so likely lack of statistical power to control for much of anything.  He got the analysis past his committee, so hopefully it was redeemed at least partially in some way, but on the face of it I wouldn't conclude much of anything from the results presented because neither of the two groups of subjects provides much useful counterfactual information for the other, given the differences between them.    Even if the initial differences between the two groups weren't statistically significant (which is likely, if the dissertation was accepted), it should be remembered that statistical significance is a function of the N's and the N's in this study would have been very small. That doesn't mean they don't matter.  It just means that, given the number of subjects and the variation among them, one can't make further inferences based on it.

Plus, as high volume is undoubtedly optimal for hypertrophy, 30 sets in one day vs 30 sets spread across two days (15/day) is vastly different, for the reasons I outlined.

AdvancedFitness,2f2pb1,kingdogtheman,7,Sun Aug 31 10:37:04 2014 UTC,"It appears that you are still looking for an answer.  There are two components associated with a muscle - the series elastic component and the parallel elastic component. The series elastic component is the tendon that attaches into the given muscle, which can store energy on its own but derives a substantial portion of its applied energy from the contracting muscle. The parallel elastic component is pretty much everything else but primarily ligaments and fascia. These structures have no contractile properties but instead apply force based on being stretched beyond their resting length.  A major factor as to why a person can lift a greater load when lifting eccentrically than concentrically is that they engage the parallel elastic component that apply a non-trivial force to the joint in question."
AdvancedFitness,2f2pb1,Correriander,2,Sun Aug 31 19:08:40 2014 UTC,"Thank you, this is helpfull. I understand the series elastic component, wasn't fully aware/ know the details of the parallel elastic component"
AdvancedFitness,2f2pb1,amazing_username,1 point,Mon Sep 1 00:42:00 2014 UTC,"The Hill Muscle Model predicts that the parallel elastic component engages when the muscle is extended. This actually is independent of shortening velocity. An extension of this model includes the viscosity of muscle. For damped motion, there is always some additional force which opposes the motion. In this way,  viscoelasticity of muscle tissue accounts for some of the force-velocity curve's negative slope.   I don't have an explanation for eccentric actions on a microscopic scale though."
AdvancedFitness,2f2pb1,bicepsblastingstud,3,Mon Sep 1 03:49:19 2014 UTC,"I'm on my phone so this will be brief.   The most compelling explanation I have heard is that eccentric is stronger because of the way actin/myosin ratchet to contract. Basically, actin and myosin need to actively shorten to gain concentric action, which requires X force.  In an eccentric contraction, actin and myosin can bind, but don't need to shorten, since the sarcomere is lengthening. This means that all the little pairs can bind to slow down the eccentric movement, then have the bond break and immediately re-bind.   Think of someone army crawling across a floor versus being dragged by the feet and constantly grabbing on to handholds briefly."

AdvancedFitness,2f2pb1,Joshua_Naterman,4,Sun Aug 31 14:10:50 2014 UTC,"Why is there more muscle damage in eccentric training then?  What you said Does makes sense to me. But in all the research that i'm reading, they continually say that there is more strength in eccentric contraction than concentric and it makes me curious. I saw one possible explanation as that there is less actin-myosin detachment in eccentric contraction, as well as a number of neural factors."
AdvancedFitness,2f2pb1,Strikerrjones,4,Sun Aug 31 14:16:42 2014 UTC,"Myosin attached to actin break more easily. As you pointed out, actin and myosin aren't detaching because they're trying to shorten, but instead getting longer."
AdvancedFitness,2f2pb1,Joshua_Naterman,3,Sun Aug 31 15:24:05 2014 UTC,There's more muscle damage because actin and myosin are being torn apart rather than being released by ATP.
AdvancedFitness,2f2pb1,Strikerrjones,1 point,Sun Aug 31 22:39:00 2014 UTC,"I am sorry, but that is incorrect.  for /u/astrocytic /u/Catholic_Spray and /u/kingdogtheman, and everyone else:  What is happening is that fewer fibers are supporting the same load. This leads to more strain, meaning more stretch. The components that hold the fibers to their neighboring fibers are subjected to larger than normal forces, which in turn subjects the plasma membrane to higher force and thus greater strain. This causes membrane defects.  Our bodies actually dramatically increase the number of intermediate filaments that attach muscle cells to each other after exposure to intense eccentric exercise for the first time, which is why once your body has had 3-4 weeks to get used to it you won't get very sore from the same exact workout: The cells have a greater number of attachments to their neighbors, more effectively sharing the forces they are experiencing and reducing their vulnerability to damage.  EDIT: You also see damage primarily at the z-discs, not at actin or myosin themselves. Reading a good physiology book will show you more about this."

It's all quite fascinating, and excellent mechanical design."

AdvancedFitness,2f2pb1,FuckThatIKeepsItReal,1 point,Sun Aug 31 23:12:51 2014 UTC,"Eccentric contraction does produce more force per fiber.   As far as I am aware, the exact mechanism is not entirely understood. Some people think that both myosin heads end up being engaged on actin and just slide from active site to active site as the muscle extends. Last time I talked with my professors who study this area they said they tend to favor this hypothesis, and I think I remember one of them saying they think the evidence is moving in this direction and that people are getting close to showing this in a lab, but I can't remember.  Your reasoning seems sound at first, but physics disagrees. As long as you are moving at a constant rate, you are going to be working against the acceleration of gravity whether you are moving up or down. The absolute value of the mechanical work done will be the same.   Work =Force * distance, and force is mass * acceleration. Gravity (acceleration of the earth on us) doesn't change, and there's no other acceleration if your velocity is constant. Therefore, same work is done.  EDIT: The exception to this is the initiation of the repetition, but if you move at the same speed both concentrically or eccentrically you will do the same amount of work during that period of identical speed movement.  Biochemically, however, eccentric work costs a LOT less energy. This is not because passive structures are taking the load: That's a function of current sarcomere length relative to maximum sarcomere length. Concentric and eccentric both have high passive components of force with elongated muscles.  The lower energy usage suggests that there is much less ATP hydrolysis and subsequent regeneration necessary to move the same load eccentrically. If that is true, we are very likely looking at something very different happening between actin and myosin than what we believe happens during concentric contractions."

While in inner or outer range, the muscle is at a mechanical disadvantage due to a suboptimal length-tension ratio. It would be at a mechanical advantage while in mid range, where it has an optimal length-tension ratio.  The explanation above regarding the fact that myosin and actin merely have to slowly release during an eccentric contraction, not pull, is the physiological basis for the greater strength"
AdvancedFitness,2f2pb1,Beerpocalypse,1 point,Sun Aug 31 23:35:20 2014 UTC,"Here's my non-biological explanation: it takes a certain amount of strength to overcome (AKA, concentrically contract) a force, whereas a force too great (AKA, supramaximal load) can only be resisted (AKA, eccentrically contracted).

Don't go over about 5mg/kg body weight consumption per day (seems like it might be best to split this up, especially if you take more than that).   It also helps burn more fat and maintain lean mass.   Just try not to consume any caffeine within 6 hours of bedtime (the longer the better), because it reduces melatonin production (and has nearly a 6 hour half life).

Caffeine fucks up your sleep and sacrificing your recovery for a harder workout is actually shooting yourself in the foot twice.  If you workout harder you need to recover better.  Any caffeinated workouts need to be done in the first half of the day, not the latter half.

That exercise really adds great shape to the physique too, so one I was really enjoying aesthetically.  Deadlifts and squats are unimpeded so I can progress on those nicely, thank god.  I'm about 150lb, 5'7"", and after a year of starting them, deads are at 300, squats only 235, so not that impressive, but at least I'm getting 2x bw on deads which was my goal a year ago when I started doing them.    The BFR method looks interesting but kinda scary to be honest.  Must feel like your bi's are going to pop!  I'll give it a try though.

AdvancedFitness,2evoo2,SageBait,5,Fri Aug 29 02:16:23 2014 UTC,"Agreed, but it reinforces the notion that excess carbs are bad (or at least, worse) when you are already glycogen saturated. Being able to stay below saturation level, either through precise diet or weekly depletion periods, should be good for avoiding fat gain, right?"

AdvancedFitness,2evoo2,WTF-BOOM,3,Fri Aug 29 04:16:47 2014 UTC,"Not really? If you're eating so much carbs that you're getting de novo lipogenesis, those extra carbs aren't helping with performance or hypertrophy, are they? They're becoming fat stores. My thinking was that carefully regulating carbohydrate intake so that you're never glycogen saturated, and thus creating fat, but still have sufficient stores for (near) optimal performance/hypertrophy should be possible."
AdvancedFitness,2evoo2,PotentialApathy,2,Fri Aug 29 05:31:42 2014 UTC,never glycogen saturated - optimal performance/hypertrophy should be possible.   I'm saying I doubt it.  I also think perpetually hovering just below the limit of glygocen storage is a completely unrealistic dietary plan.
AdvancedFitness,2evoo2,WTF-BOOM,3,Fri Aug 29 05:48:47 2014 UTC,No disagreement here - there's no way to reliably know where your glycogen stores are at so the balancing act of enough for full performance but not so much that you have de novo lipogenesis is near impossible. You could declare that as your diet plan all you want but actually achieving it is another thing.  Mostly I'm just thinking out loud here.

AdvancedFitness,2etk0x,dirfarg,6,Thu Aug 28 13:31:08 2014 UTC,"this is certainly an interesting paper. An issue that arises in similar papers (and there are several) is that jumping mechanism can vary tremendously among individuals. Even a standing vertical will have different contributions of ankle, hip, and knee extension, among other things. Not to mention that the way people (especially in my experience football players) power clean isn't exactly ""textbook"" form."
AdvancedFitness,2etk0x,incredulitor,2,Thu Aug 28 14:49:59 2014 UTC,"On textbook form, my guess is that the difference between activation patterns might be even bigger in well-trained Olympic lifters than in the football or volleyball players covered here.  You can see in figure 1 how during the 2nd/3rd pull of the clean, the body is leaning back a bit to counteract the movement of the bar in a way that you couldn't really do in a jump or jump squat without traveling backwards.  It seems like I've seen a lot of less experienced weightlifters jump forward during their clean because they haven't learned to do that yet.  It's cool though that this study found such a big difference in power development.  Seems like some good quantitative evidence that the traditional use of the power clean is valid."
AdvancedFitness,2etk0x,DefinitelyLying,2,Thu Aug 28 16:16:38 2014 UTC,"From the discussion section:   Based on the data presented in the current study, this would indicate that the jump squat should be a better training exercise to improve vertical jump than the power clean. This is in agreement with the literature, which tends to show slightly greater improvement in jump squat training studies. However, serious limitations such as differences between participant populations, training volumes, length of interventions, and measurement methods exist when trying to compare findings from previous studies. As such, more direct comparison training studies are required before such a conclusion can be made."
AdvancedFitness,2eq5ni,manup84,7,Wed Aug 27 14:12:18 2014 UTC,"For the purpose of gaining strength and relative hypertrophy, I have used a 2-3 second eccentric phase with a maximally explosive concentric phase since reading Brad Schoenfeld's book. No pauses at either end. I quote Dr. Schoenfeld's work so often on here it looks like I'm getting paid to say it, but as a leading researcher in trying to find the underlying mechanisms of muscular hypertrophy and strength, I consider it a gold-standard source.   Now why this tempo scheme? A controlled eccentric phase increases time under load, a known mechanism for increasing muscular hypertrophy. A maximally explosive concentric phase is proposed to activate higher threshold motor units, an area Dr. Schoenfeld had been interested in lately. One of his most recent publications (abstract: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-014-2976-9) showed that there is greater EMG activity in loads of 75% 1RM compared to 30% 1RM loads, indicating incomplete motor pool activation in the lesser loads. However, these lower-recruited muscle fibers (likely type I, slow twitch muscle fibers) do experience hypertrophic processes, so it is not time wasted doing low load repetitions to relative or total failure for the purpose of total muscular hypertrophy."

It doesn't indicate how completely the pool is activated during the course of the training bout.   If I tell you I eat one type of food at each meal, it does not follow I only eat one type of food per day.  Concluding the momentary activation is the same fibers, much less preferential activation of fiber types, is not supported (or contradicted) by the EMG data."

Poor word choice in that sentence on my behalf. While it may not be supported by that EMG data, it is known through the rate coding of motor unit recruitment that lower relative loads do not recruit higher threshold motor units. The higher threshold motor units tend to be those with a MHC isoform profile of fast-twitch muscle fibers."

To say they don't matter is an overstatement, but to think a certain combination would be like unlocking a cheat mode is naive.  The bottom line is that real results take real time. While it's perfectly natural to spend that time looking for some way to speed things along, if you're already 98% optimal just by showing up consistently with a good program and solid nutrition then variables like this might be the key to getting a year's worth of results just a few workouts sooner.   That doesn't make the variables advanced. It makes them trivial.

Pregnenolone administration can increase neurogenesis and memory/cognitive function and plays a very integral role in modulating the NMDA receptors positively. This is surmise at this point, but it most likely plays a role here.  It's also interesting to note that other studies have noted that testosterone has a brain protective and enhancing effect (such as antidepressant action), as well as increases spine density in the hippocampus. The effects seem to be more centered around: too low (hypogonadism) or too high test (exogenous administration) is what induces deleterious effects. Even in the case of the latter, however, if you administered pregnenolone (and maybe a few other kinks I'm not thinking of right now) it may ameliorate the negative effect."

Ephedrine and Pseudo Ephedrine have a number of unpleasant side effects, and are implicated in a number of deaths. That's why they are now restricted medications and available only with prescription or from pharmacists over the counter in most parts of the world. Their use in the production of methamphetamine is another reason.  Fact is, the use of these drugs for weight loss carries significant risk. The risk outweighs the benefits, since weight loss can be achieved through moderation of diet to a large degree, and exercise to a lesser degree and without resorting to any substances to accelerate that process.  So, DNP and Ephedrine and a number of other substances will continue to be used by those seeking to push the boundaries of what they can achieve with their bodies, but should NOT form part of a general exercise or fitness programme, and should NOT be part of standard advice to anyone seeking to lose weight.  They're also on the banned list of substances for athletes, and so could cost professional athletes their career, or amateurs their victories."

DNP has other possible sides but most of it is speculation based on animal studies. Most of the human trials are old case-studies on obese patients. If used in lower doses (200 mg) it's pretty much universally safe. DNP is dangerous because of stupid people.
AdvancedFitness,2eewi0,dirfarg,0,Mon Aug 25 22:35:48 2014 UTC,"there isn't anything inherently dangerous about an ionophore like DNP.   That statement is patently incorrect. It uncouples a metabolic pathway and can cause a runaway in body temperature. It's effects are irreversible should it go wrong.  It can kill you, and in relatively small doses too. It's banned as a dietary supplement/weight loss remedy because  bunch of housewives went blind in the 50's when it was used in diet pills.  If you don't understand why something that acts in the way it does is so unsafe, then you shouldn't be playing about with it, much less calling it 'safe'. It works through poisoning your metabolism. If it wasn't effective it losing weight, it would just be a poison."
AdvancedFitness,2eewi0,AyCarrumba,5,Mon Aug 25 23:52:32 2014 UTC,do you know anything about metabolism? Because I'm guessing you don't. Ionophores are quite common and just because excessive DNP can cause death does not make it inherently dangerous.    can cause a runaway in body temperature   Only with high doses. No one has ever died from taking 200 mg.   It's effects are irreversible should it go wrong   Proving again you know nothing about its pharmacology. Cold fluids IV coupled with dantrolene can save someone who's overdose on DNP although it has to be administered quick.   It's banned as a dietary supplement/weight loss remedy because bunch of housewives went blind in the 50's when it was used in diet pills.   Have you actually done any real research on DNP? NADPH–semiquinone reductase issues can occasionally lead to cataracts and that's in .1% of cases. Wow so dangerous   If you don't understand why something that acts in the way it does is so unsafe   Yes please teach me the innerworkings of a molecule I've synthesized and worked extensively with and helped write papers on.  Stop fear mongering. DNP can be dangerous and no one is saying it isn't. But with small dosages the sides are very manageable and there is pretty much no risk.
AdvancedFitness,2eewi0,dirfarg,0,Tue Aug 26 03:37:20 2014 UTC,"I bow to your superior knowledge, but you do contradict yourself:   DNP can be dangerous  If used in lower doses (200 mg) it's pretty much universally safe.

Possibly, yes. I said in my first post 'I am no expert on this' since I'm aware that /r/AdvancedFitness is populated by some real experts.  I HAVE seen people recommeded DNP to Noobs requesting advice on /r/fitness re weight loss. I've seen those postsupvoted. That SCARES me because I know enough to know that you shouldn't simply put it out there like everyone is doing it or that it's the first weapon in the fight against flab.  People will always push the limits, regardless of risks. DNP is danerous because it is an effective weight loss drug, so people will keep using it, and also because a lethal dose is very close to an effective dose, right? As you say, that bodybuilder wanting that extra edge could tip themselves off of the cliff and not by dosing at 50x the rate, but just a few hundred milligrammes. Dosage errors don't bear thinking about.  And my feelings on DNP are that it should never be necessary. You can lose fat to an impressive level through proper diet control and exercise. The clinically obese need medical assistance to address their issues. I have a problem with the whole 'take a pill to make this happen' mentality that seems to be strong in the fitness community sometimes. Beyond supplements, as far as I'm concerned, the abuse of prescriptions medicines (ephidrine) or banned substances (DNP) has no place in general fitness. I think it's a real shame that Bodybuilding is awash with drugs, because bodybuilders ARE inspirationsal to people, and then they find out the look was achieved with drugs... so they experiment and leave themselves open to really severe harm or even death. All for a look that I think it's fair to say is 'unnatural'.  I look upon anabolic steroids somewhat differently. Considering they have to be procured on the black market and used without medical superviion, they appear to be remarkably safe. Plus, it's actually impossible to gain mass beyond a certain point without them. So they have both a decent safety record and a real utility. And of course medical uses.  So I think the core issue is challenging the organisations that promote this incredibly lean body image, which is both unnatural and unhealthy, and also drives less experienced people into experimentation with drugs that they have no business playing with.  All in my seriously underinformed opinion, of course."

Tons of studies that test our ""common"" sense show it false and people can rationalize anything - it takes the science to know what's true.  This study is showing that exercising the opposite leg makes the other leg more tired, and the same transfer doesn't happen when you train the biceps. Basically that means it isn't general fatigue that is causing the less forceful contraction so there is something muscle specific. So in some fashion each leg's fatigue affects other for an unknown reason. This is really useful to know, especially to plan things for single leg training or rehab type stuff in which one leg is used more than the other. It's also just a really interesting result.

It's worth noting that both the normal control mice in this study and the 12-LO knockout mice developed obesity and insulin resistance, but the knockout mice still had healthy and functioning beta cells.   Type II diabetes is characterized both by impaired insulin production via damaged beta cells and a lowered response to insulin via insulin resistance. This study shows us how obesity/high sat. fat diets might be destroying people's ability to produce insulin by destroying beta cell function, but a separate mechanism is responsible for insulin resistance, and this is an equally big component of metabolic disorder."

I believe these diets are great and effective for short term weight loss because they eliminate most of the worst forms of processed and refined foods, but I believe it's a poor choice for long-term health.    As anecdotal evidence, my health-nut father comfortably lost weight eating 50% fat by calories from mostly good sources like fish, avocado, nuts, and high oleic oils, and very low carb.  After several years of being fit as a fiddle in this manner, he developed signs of diabetes from impaired insulin production. Through slowly raising his carbs back up to 55% of his calories from only unprocessed, cellularly intact sources, and lowering his fat intake to 22%, he was able to restore his insulin production and sensitivity.  Edit: I don't really know how to reconcile those results with studies like this, however."

But this is not a ketogenic diet.  'Ketogenic' is not a synonym for 'super low carb'. Ketogenesis is a biochemical process that breaks down fatty acids (in the absence of glucose). If you don't eat much fat, then a significant amount of ketogenesis is impossible, so it's no longer a ketogenic diet.  Even worse, we can make glucose out of protein through the process known as gluconeogenesis. This means that if you eat too much protein on a keto diet, the glucose level in your blood rises, which means, yep, no ketogenesis. That's why the classic ketogenic diet is 85%+ fat (by calories), barely enough protein for growth and repair, and just a few grams of carbs.  TL;DR: Keto != low carb. Keto = ketogenesis."

My guess is that it requires a massive amount of protien to offset ketosis, but I don't have any data on it. My BS call was mostly on your statement that you can only eat a few hundred calories worth of protien. It's relatively easy to eat a few pounds of lean meat per day if you like to eat and like meat."

I can eat plenty of chicken thigh and steak and whatnot, but those do not qualify as low fat foods, and there's no way I'm eating 2000 calories of chicken breast. Unless you get the majority of your calories from protein (which is not a well-studied or commonly recommended strategy), for a given calorie intake, high carb is low fat and vice versa.  That's why the paper you linked to looks interesting, being a rare study of a mostly-protein diet. I wonder whether they confirmed elevated ketone levels. I'll see if I can dig up the full text later.  Some interesting bits from McDonald's site:   http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/nutrition/ketosis-and-the-ketogenic-ratio-qa.html http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/ketogenic-diets-high-fat-or-high-protein-qa.html   Basically, he says that these higher protein diets tend to induce much less ketogenesis than classic ketogenic diets, but for weight loss, ketogenesis isn't really the end goal, so that's OK.

I'm guessing that having all of those fat stores went a long way towards keeping them in ketosis."
AdvancedFitness,2e6b0g,Ballaticianaire,0,Fri Aug 22 00:03:48 2014 UTC,"Again, I disagree on the high fat. My understanding is that to actually have Gluconeogenesis at any real level, you'd have to eclipse calorie expendature with protien injestion not just for overall calorie expendature, but also for whatever normal protien turnover you have. So if you have a 3000 calorie maintenance, you'd need to injest something like 1 Kg of protien, which is really unlikely. Lyle discusses this at some length here: http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/nutrition/excess-protein-and-fat-storage-qa.html  Anyhow, ketosis is the conversion of fat to energy, but IIRC, it doesn't require DIETARY fat. Body fat works just as well, and this is the basis of thinking for ketogenic diets for weight loss in general. So your diet does not have to be high fat to be ketogenic, just low carb and calorie negative."
AdvancedFitness,2e6b0g,downquark5,1 point,Fri Aug 22 03:50:34 2014 UTC,"You are partially right. The only thing keto says is: Keep carbs low enough typically under 30g a day and make your protein numbers everyday (typically 1g/lb lean mass) and fill rest in with fat based on calorie goals.   For some people with extreme fat loss that might be lower fat but it is lower calories. Lets say they eat 1200 calories a day and 130g protein and that leaves about 60g fat. I would not consider it ""high fat"" but percentage wise it is around 10/45/45 C/F/P. So it's more of a high protein diet than high fat.   Also, you can't overeat protein and be on keto as too much protein takes you out of ketosis as protein gets converted into glucose."

T2D first manifests as insulin resistance as obesity continues in development. At first, insulin secretion is actually robustly augmented, aiming to offset the cellular resistance, that is until the pancreatic beta cells are destroyed/damaged. This enzyme doesn't play the role in insulin resistance itself, but does in the beta cell dysfunction and thus T2D to T1D transition.   As for some of the discussion here about high fat diets or saturated fats, also erroneous. This is an inflammatory enzyme.. A hallmark of obesity is the profound inflammation via mainly macrophages (some NK and T cells too) prod TNF, IL1, IL6, etc which is then augmented by LOX pathways and such."

AdvancedFitness,2e6b0g,bonesingyre,1 point,Thu Aug 21 21:11:43 2014 UTC,What a surprise: wrong again. 12-LO is upregulated and increased during an infection as well and plays a role in systemic inflammation.
AdvancedFitness,2e6b0g,Ballaticianaire,6,Thu Aug 21 21:55:09 2014 UTC,"Lmfao. Of course accreting FFAs during obesity contribute to insulin resistance & diabetes via, as you said beta cell damage and its more integral role in simply competing with glucose as an energy substrate due to sky-rocketed levels.   What I'm saying about this study is: you and many others in here simply have such a limited scope of knowledge you plainly don't understand the processes involved. Do some more reading. I'm saying that it's not a high fat diet that's important here, it's the onset of obesity which then floods the body with circulating FFAs, as I've mentioned. I posted a study which noted that pathway is upregulated in human obese subjects. That's NOT singularly responsible for the insulin resistance, but is clearly (shown here) largely responsible for the actual beta cell dysfunction. I'm not saying this finding isn't important: it is, it's more delineation of the processes involved (except there's studies from even 2005 and before noting the role of lipoxygenase, COX, etc in metabolic syndrome inflammation), however, there's other contributors to beta cell apoptosis and general perturbation that are robustly increased in obesity, such as; HIF-1 alpha, the FFAs themselves, the pancreas pumping out massive levels of insulin causes decay and malfunction over time, and last, this pathway which involves producing the pro-inflammatory cytokines and proinflammatory mediators (ie leukotrienes via lipoxygenase). The lipoxygenase pathway is upregulated and activated during general macrophage (and other immune cells, such as T lymphocytes which play a large role in the propagation as well) activation and inflammation/clonal expansion and chemotaxis. It has nothing to do with a ""high-fat diet"" you keep ignorantly pontificating. Obesity is inflammatory and leads to the prod of these pathways because the adipocytes literally become necrotic via asphyxiation - they're deprived of oxygen (there's a lot more to go into here, but I'd rather not type another several paragraphs, so just do some reading yourself). In fact, there's studies and researchers that note the main impetus behind perpetuated inflammation is in fact the hypoxia, which then manifests as pro-inflammatory mediator prod (which lipoxygenase plays a role in). Much of this response is simply aiming to mitigate the hypoxia and necrosis & apoptosis via increasing angiogenesis. However, the hypoxia shifts gene expression, which shifts the adipokine secretome, augmenting the inflammation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, etc. There's also the factor of the adipocytes striving to increase prod of proteins which upregulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) which is yet another perpetuating and deleterious cycle to deal with.   Pro-tip: when you're not completely scientifically literate, don't force it.   Now that I've edified a bit, a smidge about the study as I'm simply tired of typing.   The first line notes that obesity is typically the result of a diet high in saturated fat.. if it wasn't for this discussion I would stop reading there because that's so vacuous it's unbelievable. The TEF difference between saturated vs unsaturated fat is too miniscule to note, so I'm not sure what that statement is predicated upon. I believe the statement here from the paper is what's causing so much confusion:  ""The lipoxygenases represent a group of enzymes that catalyzes the oxygenation of poly- 51 unsaturated fatty acids to form inflammatory lipid intermediates, which have been shown to  52 contribute to oxidative stress""  You do know the signal transduction pathway, correct? It has nothing to do with intake of sat or unsat fats, it's literally cleaving products from our cell membrane lol. The studies note and use high-fat diets simply because fat is the most caloric dense macronutrient, thus it's easiest to make a mice obese on a very high-fat diet. I mean, that's not a hard thing to realize really. The study itself is definitely meaningful, it gives insight into the role of lipoxygenase on the direct destruction of pancreatic beta cells.. but even the study notes in most other aspects apart from direct level of secreted insulin,  the difference isn't significant, nor is that even close to being the only contributor towards it. Plus you and many others have it completely wrong talking about high sat fat diets and other such gobbledygook.   To succintly point out something about saturated fats themselves: they're not bad, everyone stop freaking out. They raise both HDL and LDL, diminishing any possible noxious derangement that could occur. They are completely fine."

AdvancedFitness,2e6b0g,nigelregal,3,Thu Aug 21 23:55:14 2014 UTC,these researchers and their collaborators at Eastern Virginia Medical School showed that 12-LO (which stands for 12-lipoxygenase) is present in these cells only in people who become overweight.   Any information as to how this gets introduced to the cells? Where does it come from?
AdvancedFitness,2e6b0g,downquark5,1 point,Thu Aug 21 23:51:52 2014 UTC,"It is an enzyme, a protein, that is produced by the cells. It likely follows the same general process as other proteins whose production is regulated; the cell responds to environmental signals at its cell wall (usually a signalling protein that binds to cell wall receptors), which triggers a mechanism inside the cell that eventually activates a transcription factor, which is a protein that binds to DNA at a particular gene and regulates that gene's expression, turning it on or off."
AdvancedFitness,2e6b0g,pohatu,1 point,Fri Aug 22 00:28:17 2014 UTC,"So, as a result of saturated fat diets, cells produce 12-LO? And 12-LO is what's breaking down the cell's ability to produce insulin?   Do they know why cells produce this to being with? It is indeed interesting information, but I'm afraid a lot of these science papers are well over my head to properly grasp.... :/  High saturated fat diets (Western Diets) causes cells to produce 12-LO which, in turn, slows down entry production of pancreatic cells, preventing them the ability to produce insulin, which is necessary to expunge excessive sugar in the blood stream. I think I'm getting the hang of this!"
AdvancedFitness,2e6b0g,Insamity,1 point,Fri Aug 22 01:21:12 2014 UTC,"I don't believe the pathophysiology for 12-LO is fully understood.  In general, lipoxygenases have diverse functions from signalling pathways to fatty acid oxidation.  This paper doesn't go into the biochemistry of the particulars, just noted the result of oxidative destruction of pancreatic beta cells in the presence of this enzyme but not in its absence.  And yes, beta cells produce insulin, which drives sugar from the blood and into cells for storage or immediate use.  Without a healthy insulin response, blood sugar levels rise until they become toxic. 12-LO results in oxidative damage of beta cells, and is present only in obese test subjects fed a HFHC diet."
AdvancedFitness,2e6b0g,downquark5,2,Thu Aug 21 16:28:34 2014 UTC,"Before getting too excited, it is important to keep in mind that mouse metabolism is markedly different from human metabolism.  Case in point: The ""obesity gene"" involved in the leptin pathway was first studied in mice. Everyone thought ""OH SNAP, now we know what's happening!"" A cure for obesity was nigh...  But, the Gods of Nature had conspired against the faith of humans in the ingenuity of the mouse model, who soon found that the ""obesity gene"" in humans was regulated in a completely different manner from regulation in mice. Alas, alas, for we have no happy ending just yet.  The answer was the holy grail, vanishing to mist as a new search began. And so the wheel turns...  But seriously, getting away from the sudden desire to write the story as pseudoscripture, this is actually what happened. Humans have very different regulation of metabolism than rodents. We live on completely different scales of relative speed and overall activity, with different muscle fiber types, relative metabolic rates, and different genetic regulation.  This gives us a fantastic new starting point to explore and build upon, but it is far from the end. There are a whole lot of subtypes of diabetes, it is not just one disease. There will probably not be just one cure, and whatever we discover will likely not work the same way in mice as it does in humans."
AdvancedFitness,2e6b0g,down_vote_city__,2,Thu Aug 21 18:40:36 2014 UTC,"Fantastic news!   As my understand of the article is, high fat diets lead to 12-LO production which causes oxidative damage. So avoiding saturated fats which increase 12-LO would help to prevent diabetes or improve insulin sensitivity.   They specifically mention that mono- and poly- unstaurated fats would not cause 12-LO production.   This is very exciting. I cannot wait to see more research in this area, and maybe human trials!"
AdvancedFitness,2e6b0g,bonesingyre,4,Thu Aug 21 19:02:48 2014 UTC,"Not even close. Saturated fats have nothing to do with it and are generally okay. Sat fats promote both augmented HDL & LDL prod/levels and are fine. The culprit and real take away from this study is simply more elucidation on a nuanced pathway during OBESITY that leads to beta cell death. Specifically, they noted knocking out 12-LO increased insulin secretion vs control mice."

AdvancedFitness,2e5fla,hairaware,67,Thu Aug 21 04:14:04 2014 UTC,"The best data I have seen suggests a ~10.7g/hour limit for protein transport across the intestinal lumen into the blood. That's for absorption. Not all foods absorb at the same rate, so you will not get the same amount per hour.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16779921 is the review.  Of course, not all foods pass through the digestive tract at the same rate either... larger solid food boluses, boluses with long chain fatty acids, and boluses with more solid food protein all tend to pass through slower, giving a prolonged absorption window. In the end, though, your maximal absorption will occur via repeated and overlapping fast-digesting protein pulses.  However, actual utilization is a lot more complicated.   For example, Alan Aragon has reviewed quite a lot of literature that suggests that sustaining prolonged elevation of blood amino acid levels beyond 4-5 hours offers no benefit and may actually suppress the anabolic response beyond that point. He believes that the research also suggests that people get their best results from eating every 4-5 hours, but I think that is only true with solid meals. I think that the truly dedicated can get better results by using smaller pulses of whey protein every 2 hours, but that is a scheduling hazard for people with a real life and Alan's suggestion is clearly the best overall strategy for regular people in my opinion.  If that is accurate, then we are looking for pulses and there is limited use for either trying to keep a sustained peak absortion rate for more than 3-4 hours. Instead we would see better results by generating repeated peaks that drop down to near-basal levels before the next bolus is introduced. Large single doses do not appear to generate much of any additional total muscle protein synthesis vs a smaller 30g dose in the young or elderly: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3197704/figure/F2/  Considering how rapidly whey protein appears to absorb, you could use many small doses to achieve this effect.   Overall protein utilization for muscle protein synthesis appears to hinge upon achieving a ~3g dose of leucine that is absorbed fairly rapidly. This corresponds to ~28g of whey protein, 36-38g of beef protein and ~42g of chicken protein.  Our bodies are capable of selectively absorbing more 'important' EAA like leucine when there is more total AA than can be absorbed in full present in the intestines.   This leucine peak appears to be the nutritional trigger for muscle protein synthesis in particular, so it is worth keeping that as a central piece of your strategy. A large, fast-absorbing bolus of protein like 30g of whey is going to maximize your actual muscle gain, because pretty much nothing in the body is perfectly linear and that includes the response to blood leucine concentration.  Boirie Y, Dangin M, Gachon P, Vasson MP, Maubois JL, Beaufrère B. Slow and fast dietary proteins differently modulate postprandial protein accretion. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Dec 23;94(26):14930-5.  There is also more recent research that continues to find this to be true.  The effect is much more pronounced in the elderly, as their muscle tissue appears to become resistant to lower doses of leucine but nearly identically sensitive to the 3g dose that comes with 30g of whey when compared to 25 year olds. This suggests that older individuals should make an effort to consume 30g of protein at one time, instead of many small servings. The net effect is much larger when they get 30g, even though they absorb just fine.  Consuming proteolytic enzymes such as Aminogen (pancreatic enzymes) appears to raise the peak blood amino acid levels as well as how long the peak remains. This may cause downregulation of endogenous pancreatic enzyme production over time, and I do not believe there is any clinical data to suggest what a suggested on-off cycle of this strategy should look like.  http://www.jissn.com/content/5/1/10  Additionally, you need to provide the energy to support the use of the protein you absorb for anabolic processes to occur and exercise so that gene transcription related to increased protein anabolism is upregulated, triggering the additional post-exercise increase in muscle protein synthesis after feeding. Young and old have nearly identical responses.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8368290 There is a lot of newer replication.  Together this appears to allow us to run the following game plan:  1) Eat 40-50g of protein every 4-5 hours with a meal. You could also do 30g every 3 hours. That's what I do most of the time, but I would really just match the intake to your schedule. The longer the gap between meals, the more important it will be to use real meats that are not super lean in order to sustain the gastric emptying so that the protein actually sustains you through the entire gap.  2) Engage in resistance training to maximize response to each meal.  3) If you are adventurous perhaps do 1 day on, 1 day off supplementation with pancreatic enzymes or brand-name Aminogen at a dose of 2.5g per meal. You could do 5g, but the benefit is only ~10% for doubling your costs and is more likely to cause issues, so I don't recommend that approach personally. It is probably wise to also take 1-2 weeks off every 2-3 weeks, as a precaution.  It's simply impossible to say whether #3 would actually result in additional muscle mass gain... I don't know if there is data out there on that, and I can't guarantee safety, so I would consider this to be a risk that you would choose to take knowing that there are no guarantees, as opposed to an evidence-based recommendation. There were no indications of the potential for harm in the available research, but that doesn't mean all the bases were covered and there is a very small body of research.  Sorry I didn't include more links, but I'm tired and in med school. I just showed up here because I like to help out. Hopefully this is a nice springboard for you."

AdvancedFitness,2e5fla,nukefudge,1 point,Fri Aug 22 23:21:02 2014 UTC,"lovely post.  also, never saw the word ""bolus"" before, that's a neat one!  a couple of questions, if you please :)  -lots of people/sites are advocating the [somewhere between 1 and 2] grams of protein per kg of bodyweight (there are variations of the exact wording of this, which is unfortunate, but not critical to my question). so, it would make sense to instead start making people realize that they can't be eating without taking absorption rates into account? add to that, what OP asks, whether these absorption rates can be altered (""trained"").  -any suggested explanation for why there would be this difference (at base) between old and young? requiring a stronger ""trigger"" or whatever you would call it, like, old tissue getting more ""stubborn"".  -in an even wider perspective, evolution and all, how does this work out? seems it's a result of our ancestors eating a few solid meals per day, but not too many, and not too big or small (something like stomach size comes to mind, and mobility too, i guess). it'd be important to figure out these boundaries and how/if they could be manipulated/stretched?"
AdvancedFitness,2e5fla,Joshua_Naterman,3,Thu Aug 21 12:52:02 2014 UTC,"Thanks. It is actually a pretty important thing to realize that if you are consuming protein from a fast releasing source in large quantities, such as lean pork tenderloin, that having 4 meals of 50 grams won't do you as much good as having 5-6 meals of 30 grams. You will absorb a higher proportion with that second option, and over long periods of time (months to years) you will definitely notice a difference. This is honestly more important for people with high performance goals than the standard fitness enthusiast, though both will notice improvements.  Research shows that 1.2-1.4g of protein is enough for bodybuilders (g/kg) to maintain themselves, but you need more to grow. There is also research showing that above 2-2.2(even during low calorie periods) g/kg protein will not give additional improvements, and that a typical safe range is 2.8g/kg.  Together that lets us pretty much say we want between 1.5 and 2g/kg if we are working out regularly and want to build muscle."
AdvancedFitness,2e5fla,JSCMI,2,Fri Aug 22 00:51:19 2014 UTC,"Forgive what is no doubt a foolish question, but doesn't this suggest that a g/kg/day protein target entirely misses the point?   Let's say Al is 80 kg and wants to accumulate lean mass with 30g of (milk/whey) protein in a shake at 8am. For simplicity's sake, let's his only protein source is those shakes and he has 4 through the day (8am, 12am, 4pm, 8m). That's 120g protein, or about 1.5 g/kg protein, a level below what is commonly cited as optimal for growth.  His gym buddy Bob, also 80kg, puts 50g protein in his shakes. He starts much later at 1pm, then has others at 4pm and 7pm. He's just over 1.8g/kg, a higher level commonly cited as optimal.   Given the considerations you outline, wouldn't scenario (A)l produce better results in the long run than scenario (B)ob?   More generally, is the 1.5-2 range g/kg/day protein more of an incidental total that you'll probably be near if you're feeding optimally as opposed to a level of saturation that ensures near-optimal growth?"
AdvancedFitness,2e5fla,Joshua_Naterman,5,Fri Aug 22 13:41:55 2014 UTC,"No well-meaning question is foolish. I believe that the answer to your question depends on the protein sources used,   Yes, I believe scenario A would absolutely work better than scenario B if whey protein was the protein used in both cases. According to the research I am familiar with, whey passes through the digestive tract faster than casein, in 1.5-2 hours as opposed to 5-6 hours. During that time, 15-20g is absorbed. Absorbing 15-20g 5 times instead of 3 times is going to give better results. No question about that in my mind. I've seen this in action too many times to believe it's ""just in the lab.""  If the protein used was casein, there may not be much of a difference, and the larger doses might actually work slightly better because you'd probably come closer to maximizing casein uptake, and moving EAA in greater amounts.   Casein forms little bubbles, called micelles, that hide large portions of the protein molecules from enzymes. Whey dissolves nicely into much smaller chunks that do not adhere together and inhibit digestion the same way. That has a lot to do with why casein is much thicker and slower digesting for any given amount of water you were to mix 30g of whey or 30g of casein into. That viscosity difference should make the passage through the GI tract happen at different rates, which seems to be supported by available research.  I think that the question you ask has not been adequately answered in randomized controlled trial research, so from a scientific perspective I can't say anything for sure.   However, real world results coincide with the inherent limitations on protein transport across intestinal walls (at least without adding 2.5 to 5g of enzymes to the mix) when you think about what is happening, and the common myth of the necessity or utility of large doses is really just a wasteful (but fun, as any meat lover who eats an 18 ounce ribeye will tell you) way to accomplish the same net effect.  The best quality research I know of shows virtually no difference between 1.8 and 2.8 g/kg. That's actual muscle gain as well as rate of muscle protein synthesis (different studies, but similar doses).  These usually have small sample sizes so statistical power is sometimes limited. It is hard to get really great answers in the lab because of this."
AdvancedFitness,2e5fla,Joshua_Naterman,2,Fri Aug 22 22:20:05 2014 UTC,"My product recommendations are seriously as follows:  Eat food. Specifically, eat a variety of plant parts.  If you think you need an acid supplement, you could use betaine HCL but that is usually not necessary. Beets are a natural way to get HCL in your diet. You could also just take a tablespoon of vinegar and have some NaCl with your meal.  If you're going to experiment with protease enzymes, true nutrition has their own blend that is very affordable. You could also buy Aminogen powder.  You do not need to supplement with amylase or lipase, those are for carbs and fats respectively. Unless you have a genetic condition (which you would know about, believe me) you really don't need those at all.

AdvancedFitness,2e5fla,Ballaticianaire,3,Fri Sep 5 04:13:00 2014 UTC,"Virtually any amount of protein you could eat is all going to be absorbed - the real quandary emerges when considering utilization which is largely unknown to a precise degree. From a typical meal of chicken, steak, beef, etc though, you'll still have secretion of free AAs into the bloodstream for upward of 4-5+ hours afterward. That's also what makes the large post in this thread somewhat incorrect on his utter surmise about eating protein every 3 hours. There's no evidence for that, however for the ~5 hour claim, there is indeed evidence predicated on the free AA pool secretions to the bloodstream. There's also no real evidence going without food virtually all day via an IF protocol, for instance, will mitigate muscular hypertrophy in any way - you don't need to constantly shovel down food, what mainly matters is the net caloric value. A small caveat: I wouldn't recommend lifting completely fasted then going several hours without some sort of food. The pmTOR values definitely began declining after a few hours pwo with even augmented rises in AMPK from the robust catabolic state you're eliciting. However, fasting 16-20 hours a day, ensuring adequate protein & total caloric intake, plus having some sort of protein pre or pwo even toward the end of the fast? Fine."

AdvancedFitness,2e5e7r,hoponthe,3,Fri Aug 22 03:36:57 2014 UTC,"The most common argument is that you will have shoulder issues if you don't maintain proper push-pull balance, but that's not the whole story... scapular function is a major issue there, and you can screw it up with poor form pushing OR pulling.   Antagonistic muscle groups work together during movements to try and 'normalize' joint motion. The antagonists provide a 'braking force' that actually keeps the joint forces centered on the 'correct' part of the joint, and if they were to actually be completely inhibited you would lose a lot of joint stability and either tear ligaments or cartilage eventually. The joint would be quite wobbly.  If an antagonistic muscle group is too far out of balance with its agonistic partner, you basically working at a higher % of 1RM in the antagonist than you are in the agonist. So for the same reps you're actually damaging one muscle more than the other, and it can lead to injury that way as well. You see that a lot with the hamstrings vs quads in sprinters, though that's a bit over-simplified.  With synergists and stabilizers, you can run into similar issues: one muscle may kick in more than it should since the preferred prime mover is not up to the task, and this can lead to both compromised joint motion and odd injuries.  There are a lot of different ideas on what ""optimal"" balance is for any given set of muscles, but there is a fair bit of research-driven data for some of it. Like the hamstrings, as a group, should have at least 60% of the strength of the quads to avoid an increased risk of injury, with 80% being ideal. If they get too strong, you can actually see quad tears occur since THEY are too weak to withstand forces the hamstrings create.   Realistically, if you go rep for rep you and you have an injury free body to begin with, you will probably never have issues. If you are already injured, you'll have to ask more specific questions to get more specific answers :)"

AdvancedFitness,2e5e7r,Antranik,1 point,Sat Aug 23 23:48:53 2014 UTC,"They don't. But then again, most of their pushing strength doesn't get into insanely tough territories anyway. You'll rarely see a yogi doing a handstand push up or similarly intense pushing exercise, for example."
AdvancedFitness,2e5e7r,Antranik,1 point,Tue Sep 2 03:10:32 2014 UTC,Yeah I guess that's the answer: It doesn't have to be exactly balanced and most of them don't do enough push to really get radically off.   I have seen some incredible push strength from yogi's for sure though.  Mostly the pro instructors.  Maybe they are doing other things on the side...

Plus the practice in general helps increase ones self awareness, so maybe their ability to auto regulate when they feel they need more rest or to avoid a certain move is higher than others. This is all conjecture from personal experience though."
AdvancedFitness,2e5e7r,Joshua_Naterman,1 point,Thu Sep 4 03:48:57 2014 UTC,"There's a bit of allied health research out there that suggests similar things.  Whether yoga is good or bad depends on whether or not the instructor knows how to modify sequences for people who can't do them as shown, how to work around injuries, and whether a fairly balanced routine is established across a workout cycle.  There are also a number of 'advanced' poses that some people will simply hurt themselves doing no matter how careful they are, like lotus poses. Not everyone has the same vertebral structure.  In general, as long as you stay away from extreme spinal contortion yoga should be a positive part of most peoples' lives."

When we train muscles, and they get bigger and stronger, they increase their muscle tone (no, not getting ""toned""), which refers to their activity at rest (can be measured by EMG). Since opposing muscle groups involved in pushing and pulling (e.g. pec major vs rear deltoid, pec minor vs mid/lower trapezius) are essentially duking it out, if you train them out of balance, it warps your posture, because the ""tug"" is stronger in one direction.

Elite athletes develop better bone density (Wolf's Law) but one would think are more susceptible to joint dysfunction later in life from the constant wearing - which in turn would limit their mobility as they age.   It seems like it comes down to the fact that the gen pop is so out of shape and unhealthy that a group of elite athletes who move more and have better access to healthy food and medical care live longer.

As I understand it, mobility issues are associated strongly with injuries not frequent use.    Pro athletes are exercising 5-7 days per week but also are likely to over-train and or develop atrial fibrillation with an enlarged heart   For this, it's important to note that even the paper you linked in comments does not consider the evidence conclusive. Here's another paper that comes to a similar conclusion:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538475/  And finally, there are two big pieces that I think are missing from our research data in general: type of athlete and level of activity. For example, the paper I linked here is about specifically about endurance exercises like marathons and triathlons. The impact on your health may be different when compared with a professional weight lifter.   As for level of activity, there could be a huge difference between someone who works out 1-1.5 hours a day 6 days a week and someone who works out 3-4 hours a day 6 days a week."

I don't know any spry 65 year old x-elite footballer or gymnast.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18785416   In any event, I agree with you and would like to read the complete paper and find out more i.e type of athlete and level of activity"
AdvancedFitness,2e3fxo,grae313,5,Wed Aug 20 19:43:55 2014 UTC,"Certainly elite endurance runners experience lots of joint injuries due to frequent use   Agreed! This is one that's really hard to quantify with the research out there. I believe I had gotten the notion originally from doing research on the late-life impact of endurance running in comparison to other sports. For example, football players and other impact sport players tend to have a lot of injuries that lead to problems later in life, likely more so than an ultra runner.  That said, I can't find any single study or meta-analysis which can really support this. The implication of injury vs. overuse on long term health is big one though, because it is possible for an athlete to reduce their own chance for injury by altering their training plan or improving technique while still maintaining high training volume."

AdvancedFitness,2e5scd,JSCMI,6,Thu Aug 21 12:05:30 2014 UTC,"This model is based on the idea that 1RM has one variable that will (presumably asymptotically) approach a fixed limit.

Even the idea of a fixed genetic limit goes out the window when you consider the importance of technique."
AdvancedFitness,2e5scd,JSCMI,1 point,Thu Aug 21 12:42:17 2014 UTC,"Fair points. I'm curious if you train using scheduled weight increases on some kind of progression or if you do some kind of autoregulatory training?   I guess it would seem that if you can listen to your body that would adjust for all the variables and you don't have to think about it in this way. But that seems difficult, especially when you compare it to programs that seem to promise consist progress like 5/3/1 by going perhaps slower than the body could adapt. I understand 5/3/1 has AMRAP sets to compensate for this, so it is perhaps not the greatest example, but I guess it shows you can incorporate elements of each."
AdvancedFitness,2e5scd,JSCMI,2,Thu Aug 21 18:09:09 2014 UTC,"I'm curious if you train using scheduled weight increases on some kind of progression or if you do some kind of autoregulatory training?    I'm on a 5/3/1 variant so it's a training max based progression scheme. The only autoregulation is adjustment of training max based on performance from cycle to cycle. I'm just finishing up my 5th cycle and truth be told sometimes I'm tempted to try setting maxes for power days on Mon/Tues and then doing volume days on Thurs/Fri based on the earlier maxes for a few months and seeing what happens.    I guess it would seem that if you can listen to your body that would adjust for all the variables and you don't have to think about it in this way. But that seems difficult,    I'm blanking on the name of the device, but there's one on the market that hooks up to a barbell and can estimate a 1RM based on warm-up sets. It's supposedly more accurate than 2-4 rep max estimations, doesn't require any sets taken to failure, and could be used for a daily autoregulated % 1RM program without having to disrupt programming by ever testing 1RM more traditionally. It is expensive, but smartphone apps can already track bar speed pretty accurately and comparing a few warm up sets to have the app estimate your 1RM during warm up sets would not be a big step at this point. More info here   especially when you compare it to programs that seem to promise consist progress like 5/3/1 by going perhaps slower than the body could adapt. I understand 5/3/1 has AMRAP sets to compensate for this, so it is perhaps not the greatest example, but I guess it shows you can incorporate elements of each.    I disagree, at least in part. I'd point out that 5/3/1 is just the base, actually using 5/3/1 means you have accessory work to address the fact that strength (production of maximal force) is, in part, a function of muscle CSA. It also uses periodization to surpass what results could be attained with linear training. It also prescribes deload weeks which may (or may not) either allow a greater adaptation yet for various reasons but the only available evidence about these deloads is anecdotal and is very inconsistent.   Anyway, getting on 5/3/1 BBB and looking at how quickly strength progresses and saying ""Geez, this is pretty slow"" is missing half the progress. The progress in volume from starting BBB sets at 30-40% training max (a typical starting point) on up to ~60-70% of (training max + slow progress) over time is significant.   A ""faster"" program (faster for strength, at least planned), such as Madcow, will require nowhere near that amount of progress in training volume, meaning that while you'll hit a certain strength potential sooner once you get there you will have a tough time getting past it.   So the guy who's never heard of periodized training might think he's hit his genetic limit when different programming would actually allow him to reach a higher level of performance (periodized meaning Madcow or 5/3/1, to different levels, and who knows how many others)  But he got to that high of a level at a higher dy/dt for strength than the guy who switched to 5/3/1 BBB who, when he gets to that level, will likely keep sailing right by it because he's been progressing in volume instead of just strength.   You can see how complicated this gets in a hurry, even just comparing a couple of approaches. There are various metrics in which to progress that influence strength, various approaches to training that work with different efficiencies, training protocols that play to some metrics more than others, limits to how much combined progress can be made, and in fairness you have to look at risks associated with how aggressively training progress is pursued.   And none of that allows for the fact that in a number of years we may likely have a better way training than undulating periodization programming currently in vogue.   I apologize for the wall of text - I think it's a neat topic, but I think you'd have to back up and start by identifying components of strength and some of the factors that influence them that we know of. Look at this article on stress for instance, in which groups had significantly different rates of recovery depending on how stressed they felt / how many stressors they had.   Once you have some of the basic factors defined, then you'd have to start to model how they're determined and what their relationships are. I think it's still going to be like the Drake equation in that you have a bunch of components that we can take guesses at but really don't know how (in)complete our information is.  I also want to emphasize that I'm no expert on this subject. I may know enough to realize how little I know, but if so only just."
AdvancedFitness,2e5scd,JSCMI,1 point,Thu Aug 21 18:54:05 2014 UTC,"You know I was really looking at maximal strength as exisiting in a vacuum and you are  definitely right that volume must have a huge impact on progression. If anything you made a very strong argument for 5/3/1 which I've been attracted to for quite some time, and they were all for reasons I hadn't considered! I've been taking the summer off, and am still fresh enough to training that my progress is mostly linear, so I have been considering deloading and then trying a version of 5/3/1 BBB with a more aggressive progression (not sure what that would be exactly), but ICF 5x5 also seems pretty good. You certainly seem to know a bit, so if you have any thoughts on good LP programs I'm all ears, I've also been considering trying to devise my own program which wouldn't give as good results but might be more fun. If I go that routine I will definitely also consider volume/accessory progression which I hadn't given much thought to previously.  Also, that article was really interest. In addition to all the stuff he mentioned I thought it was interesting both groups were less recovered at 72 hours that 48, which kind of relates with something I've noticed training 3 days a week which is that the day after the extra rest usually feels worse. It's definitely clear from the data that training doesn't happen in a vacuum, which is kind of dishearting from a modeling standpoint, but definitely makes sense."
AdvancedFitness,2e5scd,fullchaos40,2,Fri Aug 22 02:44:09 2014 UTC,"Agreed. It should be fair to say that muscle CSA has a permissive relationship with strength progress, that it is driven hugely by volume (but also other factors), and that muscle CSA has limitations that depend on training, nutrition, rest, and genetics (but also other factors).    if you have any thoughts on good LP programs I'm all ears   Assuming you don't depend on athletics for your livelihood, consider the one you think you'll best enjoy or find most satisfying. Even if your potential ""progress"" (uselessly vague term) is twice the rate, are you going to stick with a program you don't like? That you have trouble recovering from? Are you going to do it consistently? Or is it going to quickly feel like a chore that you don't really need to be doing?  The other approach, also perfectly valid, is relentless pursuit of a specific goal. Maybe you want to squat 405, or be a lean 185 pounds, or maybe you want to be able to run the Ninja Warrior course (not gonna lie, it looks fun). In that scenario you don't need ""a good program"" you need the one that's optimally suited for that goal.   That's another reason why ""strength"" is too vague a training result. Whether strength means a world-class squat, a stage-lean physique, an iron cross on rings, or being able to climb up Everest all have overlap but are all very distinct results that have major differences in their pursuit. There's nothing wrong with pursuing general fitness & health either, which I'd assume is what most people do, and that's why I say first consider the training you'll enjoy and don't worry too much about whether you're trying to add x number of pounds to a lift in 3 months or 12.    trying a version of 5/3/1 BBB with a more aggressive progression (not sure what that would be exactly)   If you like the idea of undulating periodization of intense work sets with high volume there are lots of more aggressive options. Mike Zourdos' DUP work is a great place to get a bird's eye view on the principles. Candito has a program that is similar to 5/3/1 BBB but with more intense sets. The GZCL method is a great way to look at this too, and like Candito's program (also worth a look) the view seems to be that the 5/3/1 work sets have to few reps near 1RM, though Wendler insists people tend to do more harm than good by trying to train too heavy too often.   PHAT/PHUL are also great examples of implementing similar training principles more aggressively.   Assuming the authors above are correct in their view of what works best for them (which seems reasonable), the fact that Wendler (of 5/3/1) responds best to very little training near his 1RM while Norton (of PHAT) and Candito consider 5/3/1 too little hard work to make optimal progress is a great example of how difficult training progress is to model because of individual variation. These guys are all strong.  As an individual, the resources on subs like this are invaluable for finding things that tend to work, and understanding how things generally work will save you tons of time, but you'll still need to spend a few years tracking your training, progress, nutrition, rest, etc to start to get an idea of what works for you as an individual.   There are simply too many variables, known and unknown, to even begin to try to mathematically progress. The best we can do for now is kick around the available data that try to point us toward even asking the right questions."

The amount of technical information about programming and progression is so inspiring, thanks for the great info.

AdvancedFitness,2e5scd,SleepyPierre,1 point,Sat Aug 23 04:19:17 2014 UTC,"5x5 has merit for a beginner.   Someone new to lifting has more muscle mass than they can utilize, needs to practice technique, will find simple progression easiest, and doesn't have a meaningful 1RM. 5x5 addresses all those considerations for a rank novice.   However, I don't think that means there are no other good options.   I mostly disagree with the routine advice that nobody should switch programs until absolutely no more strength (1RM) progress is possible. I think it's fair to say almost every untrained person would benefit from being stronger, but that doesn't mean everyone should pretend to be a powerlifter."
AdvancedFitness,2e5scd,kurjagger,3,Sat Aug 23 13:01:20 2014 UTC,From person to person it would be different I calculate an equation due to the fact that people have varying amounts of both fast and slow twitch muscle fibers.

Ultimately won't tell us anything useful, but I'm all for mental masturbation :)  My first thought was to have the rate of increase inversely proportional to the weight:  dy/dt = 1/y  Solving this gives y = c * sqrt(t), which does decrease the rate over time, but still goes to infinity eventually. So that doesn't work.  I think a closer model would be something like dy/dt = (z - y), where z is the genetic limit. This gives us a solution of y = c * e-t + z, which nicely approaches our genetic limit asymptotically over time."

(8) The running rats developed hypertrophy of the left ventricle (LV) and the right ventricle (RV), diastolic dysfunction, and dilation of the left atria and the right atria (RA); they also showed increased collagen deposition and fibrosis in both the atria and ventricles (Figure 2). Ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 42% of the running rats vs only 6% of the sedentary rats (P=.05). Importantly, the fibrotic changes caused by 16 weeks of intensive ET had largely regressed to normal by 8 weeks after the daily running regimen ceased.     That was the part that interested me, so I looked at the source of the rat research: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21357374 And it said:     Walking for 30 min improved AIx (from 33.79 ± 0.91% to 31.73 ± 0.86%, p<0.001) and PWV (from 9.26 ± 0.95 m/s to 9.06 ± 0.21 m/s, p<0.001), while exercise for 60 min had adverse effects on vascular stiffness (for AIx: from 33.37 ± 0.93% to 33.73 ± 1.05%, p=NS and for PWV: from 9.25 ± 0.19 m/s to 9.37 ± 0.21 m/s, p < 0.05 mainly in older patients). Exercise for 60 min was associated with a significant 20% increase in MDA levels (p<0.05). Exercise had no effects on SOD1 levels, however it significantly increased SOD2 levels after 30 min (from 2.26 ± 0.22 ng/mL to 2.36 ± 0.18 ng/mL, p < 0.05) but not after 60 min (p=NS). Conclusion Shorter exercise duration was associated with favourable antioxidant and vascular effects, while longer exercise blunted these beneficial effects and was accompanied by adverse effects on vascular function, mainly in older coronary patients. Further studies are required to explore the hypothesis that a more individualised approach to the selection of the appropriate exercise programme should be considered for patients with CAD.     I think both of them look reasonable... so far.     Anyone care to look into their research methods to see how solid those hypotheses hold up?"
AdvancedFitness,2dvq62,Furthur,2,Mon Aug 18 16:46:43 2014 UTC,you can say the same thing about obesity and weight lifting. Those are normal responses to training and if they didn't happen the adaptations to training would be local and not systemic.

AdvancedFitness,2dvq62,Astrocytic,1 point,Mon Aug 18 19:27:58 2014 UTC,"think in terms of peripheral resistance to blood flow, higher pressure needed to drive blood through calcified non-elastic and compressed vascular system will cause chamber hypertrophy on the atrial and ventricle sides of the flow chart.  Can even start being symptomatic of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure.  also consider the local and systemic components i'm referring to.  In relation to a car, you have your gasoline (blood/nutrients), fuel pump (heart) and engine (muscles).  Gas is pretty much gas, a very high powered fuel pump can get the gas to the engine in large amounts and consistently (cardiac output = stroke volume x heart rate) if the engine can't utilize the amount of fuel it's being delivered it runs rich and spits gas out through the exhaust valves (exhalation) instead of making a stroke cycle.  The limiting factor for whether an engine can handle all the gas being tossed at it in physiology terms is transport into the cytosol and mitochondria which the strongest evidence for increasing this is through GLUT-4 transporters and endurance based training for mitochondrial biogenesis.    In the absence of disease it's almost never saturation of O2 in the blood or delivery to the muscles, it's uptake into the cells and oxidation within."

With Coronary Artery Disease these patients are likely more susceptible to producing the unfavorable markers of inflammation after an intense bout of exercise. They are chronically in a proinflammatory state compared to healthier individual.   So the average exerciser isn't likely to have negative effects at the levels in the paper,  but it's possible with exercise taken to extremes (ie marathon training) the body can produce a similar pro inflammatory state.   You can access the paper I posted elsewhere in the thread.  It's more relevant to the discussion.

AdvancedFitness,2dtwq0,super_pablo_,2,Sun Aug 17 22:43:12 2014 UTC,I agree. I'd have liked examples of what each fiber is used for and an anecdote about how to do this sort of tapering.
AdvancedFitness,2dtwq0,Andthentherewasbacon,6,Mon Aug 18 00:43:46 2014 UTC,"My undergrad motor control professor did some research on fiber types and was pretty well versed in them. So why do type IIx convert to type IIa after resistance training?  Because type IIa are actually larger and produce more force than type IIx. But pretty much every physiology book and many papers say the opposite? They're wrong!  Some of the initial studies done on muscle fiber types were done on cats. While there is a lot of similarity, there is are also differences (such as which fast twitch fiber produces the most force.)  Interestingly enough, male and female muscle fiber types may also differ in size. For male (fiber size), type IIa > type IIx > type I. For females (fiber size), type I > type IIa > type IIx.  As you point out the many muscle fibers are composed of multiple types of fiber. The same goes for what I'm saying...many of the type IIx fibers convert to type IIa/x (a combination of type IIa and type IIx).  I found this especially fascinating because this misinformation is SO widespread through exercise science. Here are the sources he gave us if you want to see for yourself:   1) Staron RS et al., Human skeletal muscle fiber type adaptability to various workloads.

AdvancedFitness,2dkrtr,AhmedF,5,Thu Aug 14 21:13:48 2014 UTC,"These findings strongly suggest that training at 30% 1RM in a compound lower-body exercise is insufficient to recruit the entire motor unit pool for the target musculature.   This seems like a really poor interpretation of the results. Obviously peak EMG is going to be higher for higher loads. Peak EMG for 1RM would be even higher than it was for the 75% group. The mean EMG was lower because when you use a lower load, you consistently recruit less motor units to move the load, and it takes significantly longer to get to failure. That doesn't mean there's less fatigue at the end and that every motor unit isn't recruited, it just means that the mean EMG activity is lower. Just because the motor units aren't all being recruited at once doesn't mean they aren't all recruited and fatigued at some point in the set.  The fact of the matter is that every study we have so far that has an equal number of sets (and even some with unequal numbers) between groups with an equal effort between sets (to failure) shows no difference in hypertrophy between loads. Brad mentions Mitchell et al as proof that there are fiber type specific differences with different loads, but the results of that study weren't significantly different AND YOU CAN'T JUST IGNORE THE STATISTICS LIKE THAT. Fuck, that makes me mad.  It's like he doesn't understand the basic concept of the size principle, even though he states it right at the beginning of the paper."

AdvancedFitness,2dkrtr,Strikerrjones,2,Sun Aug 17 14:18:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah, when I first read his blog post I was skeptical of how he jumped to the conclusion that there isn't full activation at 30%. He is doing another at 50% and 80% using bench, so I'm curious what he will say about those results. I'm not familiar with EMG results at all, but wouldn't it be better to look at a total rather than peak or mean?"
AdvancedFitness,2dkrtr,JSCMI,2,Sun Aug 17 16:54:23 2014 UTC,"50% will have more mean and peak than 30%, but less than 75%, and 80% will be higher than all of them, which I'm assuming he wants to look at because it's the classic broscience %1RM for hypertrophy. When he gets the biggest numbers for 80, he'll say that 80 is obviously superior for hypertrophy... even though 90-100% would be even higher still. Higher doesn't mean more activation over the course of a set though, since the lighter sets last so much longer. It's a completely retarded conclusion, and I'm getting more mad about it the more I think about it.  I think looking at total activation (area under the EMG line? I dunno, I don't know maths) would create a problem in the other direction - the light weight would then have a much higher number than the others. EMG just isn't the correct tool to measure if all the muscle fibers are fatiguing or not, and I have no idea why he thinks it is."
AdvancedFitness,2dkrtr,Strikerrjones,2,Sun Aug 17 17:23:46 2014 UTC,"I think area under the EMG line would be an excellent metric to include.

You'd have to control for time too, to help control for recovery, but he looked at the area under the curve for 30% 1RM sets vs 80% and found that the area under the curve integrating recruitment over time was similar for either approach done to exhaustion it'd be reasonable to conclude that although every fiber wasn't recruited at once that the entire muscle contributed over the course of the testing.  If this examination revealed a discrepancy between these integrals, and the ratio of the difference between the total time-recruitment resembled the proportions between muscle fibers present, that may be taken as evidence that perhaps certain fibers are working to exhaustion while others are never actually being recruited.   But you're absolutely right that concluding % recruited at once is evidence of % recruited at any point is a leap in logic."
AdvancedFitness,2dkrtr,Ballaticianaire,1 point,Mon Aug 18 13:30:54 2014 UTC,"I guess my issue with the area under the curve idea is that the greater aerobic contribution during low weight sets will always make them larger than higher weight sets. Local fatigue happens in part because blood can't carry away fatiguing metabolites quickly enough, and this starts to interfere with contraction. There is more blood flow at lower intensities, and if you managed to get the exact same amount of cross-bridging between a high and low weight set, the low weight set would leave the fibers less fatigued, even though the time would be longer. I feel like the longer time plus the lesser fatigue per cross-bridge would make the area quite a bit bigger than for a higher rep set.  I don't think EMG is the right tool to answer this question, and I'm not even sure if we have a tool at this point that could do it. I'm also not sure if it's even a question that needs to be answered, so long as we accept the evidence for the size principle."

The only thing I might change (to whomever made this, not sure if it was you) is that the ATP is used to disconnect the myosin heads from the troponin, not connect it. At rest, the myosin head is bonded to the troponin/tropomyosin complex and the head is bent; when ATP binds, it breaks that bond and the myosin head becomes straight. The ATP is broken down to ADP+P, then the myosin head can re-attach to the troponin and re-bend to its resting position (this causes the contraction). If anyone wants to correct me, feel free! I studied this a few years ago, so it's not super fresh in my mind."

AdvancedFitness,2dgte5,20ereedboi,3,Wed Aug 13 19:37:39 2014 UTC,I really wish that they had EMG on the glutes as well during this study. The underhand grip externally rotates the shoulder which relaxes the lat. If we follow the fascial line (shout to Thomas Myers yo!) that lat connects with the opposite glute and we can hypothesize that the glute opposite the supinated arm may be slightly inhibited. Maybe I'm reading too much into it but that seems like a relevant question that could've been answered so I'm really disappointed they didn't address it here.
AdvancedFitness,2dgte5,Iron_Tiger,2,Sun Aug 17 21:25:00 2014 UTC,"This, and some of the Contreras EMG study work, really cry out for some kind of full-body set of measurements, for similar reasons to the one you mention.

But I agree, some lower body data would provide a more complete picture.  I'd also be interested in seeing some numbers for the posterior shoulder as well. One of the vulnerable aspects of the mixed grip is that it is more difficult to create a strong stabilizing (external) rotation torque on the underhand side, given that the arm is already quite externally rotated."

AdvancedFitness,2dgte5,kneeonbelly,2,Thu Aug 14 17:30:12 2014 UTC,"From this study it was found that using an OU grip for the deadlift does produce some bilateral asymmetries in muscle activation and joint angles of the upper body. Whether these asymmetries translate to the asymmetric hypertrophy, injury, etc. is yet to be determined. However, it may be of benefit to use a double‐overhand grip to avoid these possibilities altogether. When heavy loads are used, and grip becomes a limiting factor, ergogenic aids such as lifting straps, chalk, and gloves can be used to increase the ability to grip the barbell. However, if strengthening of the forearms is a primary goal, lifting straps should be avoided, as they do decrease the stress on the musculature of the forearms. In situations where lifting straps are not allowed, “flip‐flopping” which hand is pronated/supinated in an OU grip is a good training recommendation. The handedness of humans will often make trainees want to use the same OU grip each time, but switching between ROLU and LORU regularly will help to prevent any left/right imbalances from forming. Clearly the left and right arms are not trained symmetrically with an OU grip, and this must especially be considered when utilizing the deadlift as part of a rehabilitation program."

AdvancedFitness,2dbxhm,kozlek,1 point,Tue Aug 12 20:10:00 2014 UTC,"Obesity itself causes chronic low-grade inflammation, and also decreases leptin transport across the blood-brain barrier, so I think it's possible that leptin resistance is just a secondary consequence of obesity and is reversible after weight loss. It wasn't exactly clear whether the metabolic consequences of the 10% weight loss were actually due to leptin resistance or whether there was just a deficiency in leptin levels. According to that paper, that 10% reduction in weight, which corresponded to about 25-30% reduction in fat mass, caused a 50% reduction in leptin levels. So it seems like leptin production is influenced more by recent fat loss/gain than it is by overall fat mass. It would be interesting to see if the rate of fat loss affects the response by leptin, since their protocol used a fairly restrictive 800 kcal/day diet. But regardless of whether leptin resistance is the initiating factor in obesity or not, increasing leptin sensitivity would be a great way to help maintain weight loss and it looks like there are some new PTP1B inhibitors that seem pretty promising."

While it seems more hindering than beneficial to muscle growth on its own, it is possible that physical exercise makes the issue somewhat negligible.  From what I've heard with user reports of berberine (AMPK activator with similar potency and mechanism to metformin) it doesn't really do all that much with muscle growth when paired with exercise; never heard of anybody outright failing to build muscle with berberine or Metformin."

Please correct me if I am wrong but the take home message is AMPK activation by Metformin (or berberine) can cause a reduction in MPS but increased glucose uptake caused by AMPK activation promotes MPS so it may override the reduction. Also, exercise will further stimulate MPS through AMPK activation and GLUT 4 upregulation which both increase the entry of glucose into the cell.  I would love to see a study on this topic. I have seen a study using db/db mice who were given berberine to increase insulin sensitivity. The mice did have decreased MPS and increased muscle wasting (1) but there was no exercise involved.

This write up was a pretty basic blanket statement about the obvious component of training but not quite grey in a non-black and white situation.    Several NFL teams had come to visit the facility and had mentioned needing a better way to monitor their athletes over the course of a day.  Philly being one of them and my buddy outlined the system and what it would cost to put the roster on it (millions) Eagles guy, without hesitation, says ""we can do that"".  Hence.. catapult is coming over from AUS where nearly all their rugby teams do it.  AUS is WAY ahead of the ball game when it comes to this kind of training, USA is about 6-7 years behind as AUS puts emphasis on sport performance in their ex.phys labs where we are caught up  following the money which is in health and wellness related science.  There are better and cheaper alternatives to catapult but I was then informed that the teams had to hire full time statisticians to keep it all sorted and organized i laughed a bit knowing that that was the money maker right there as managing the data and getting it to the coaches who are most certainly not physiologists or biomechanists in a digestible way is the humdinger of the problem.  If any of you have been balls deep in a high resolution data collection system you know why.  I thought I was in deep shit with 21000 data points per athlete per test and that was just skin and core temperature with some heart rate thrown in for flavor but these guys are on another level of fucked when it comes to organizing and tracking training/overreaching.  So yeah, it's not a bad article just bland and basic. The one thing coaches seem to forget about is that they are testing humans, not machines and our psychological stress can have a much bigger impact on our performance than most give credit to.  Stress hormones are pretty damn catabolic on top of already catabolic exercise is a recipe for disaster and they emphasis on pushing bigger numbers should be dialed in to consider the athletes as emotionally vulnerable humans as well as well oiled high performance machines.  edit: I can suggest a few good books on coaching and if there is interest I'll see if my friend would do an AMA."

Creatine nonresponse affects up to 30% of persons, but this number may be inflated due to being based on a study with a small sample,[217] and is defined as having less than a 10mmol/L increase in creatine stores after a short loading period. The differentiation of response and nonresponse is a threshold, and people have variable levels of creatine uptake into muscles; more of a spectrum rather than a dichotomy.[218] However, those classified as non-responders tend to not have power increased in response to creatine supplementation[219] and are an underlying reason for some studies suggesting no physical improvement by creatine; which do subsequently see significant benefit when controlling for muscle creatine content.[88] There exists some quasi-responders to creatine (between 10-20mmol/L increase) which get some benefit from creatine supplementation but not to the level of the responders (20mmol increase or more).[218]  In comparing responders against nonresponders, it is noted that responders have a higher percentage of type II muscle fibers relative to nonresponders; a positive correlation existed between overall muscle mass and weight and being a creatine responder and no differnces existed for dietary protein intake (suggesting it is unrelated).[218] Those that respond to creatine also tend to be younger, suggesting a mechanism of creatine uptake may be perturbed during aging.[220]    Creatine non-response is when muscular loading of creatine is under a certain threshold (10mmol/L) with 'response' to creatine having more muscular creatine loading (20mol/L or more) with a grey area between where some benefits are achieved but less than pure responders.

AdvancedFitness,2d0ndv,Charliek581,2,Sat Aug 9 00:27:32 2014 UTC,"That's great thanks, have some gold, it seems like everyone else is just chipping in their personal opinion which was exactly what I wanted to avoid!   Ideally I'm trying to find out if a 'non-responder' is someone who just doesn't respond to creatine supplements (due to high levels of creatine in their body through other sources of creatine), or if they are a 'non-responder' to creatine full stop. Although this may be disregarded completely...  So if I understand this correctly, there isn't a whole lot of research/studies on 'non-responders' to creatine. It also seems a little vague in the few studies it is mentioned. To me this seems a little strange considering creatine is one of the most studied supplements around. It's also interesting that examine have removed the section on non-responders completely - a quote from /u/silvahyrda 'I'm trying to abolish this whole 'non-responder' issue'. Maybe it's no longer such a big issue?   I'm really trying to find out how much truth there is behind the statement when someone says 'I'm a non-responder to creatine'. From what I can tell so far, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of evidence (aside from anecdotal evidence, but that is still debatable), and its mostly just people parroting what they have heard on internet forums.  edit: excuse my Googling, but stumbled across this website (I have no idea of the sites trustworthiness) which had this:   A creatine ""non responder"" is an individual who correctly supplements with creatine and experiences no noticeable improvements in strength, muscle mass or endurance. However, no studies have been yet reported on this concept, and as a result, it is highly possible that individuals who do not respond well to creatine are lacking in other areas, ie, training, nutrition or overall water intake. Otherwise, a lack of response to creatine supplementation is likely due to genetics if all factors of proper supplementation are adhered to, in which case, alternative supplements should be experiemented with to see if they get results.     I think when people say they are 'non-responders' they actually mean they cannot see the improvement in terms of strength or increased rep ranges, so discontinue use - not that they are complete 'non-responders' to creatine. This would bode well for my theory that a so called 'non-responder' is someone who already has adequate levels of creatine, therefore not requiring additional supplementation."

But, there's a continuum, so determining whether one benefits from it or not doesn't seem to be black-and-white IMO. As well the strength benefit isn't any amazing increase (I don't have any exact range of added lbs but i don't believe it's a large increase), so perhaps it becomes even more difficult to assess assuming one is progressing in their training alone already."

AdvancedFitness,2csq1t,fz6greg,4,Wed Aug 6 16:08:07 2014 UTC,"Yep, I worked for a pharma related company several years ago. All generics are just drugs were the patent has expired, and they can be produced by other companies. They still have to be of the exact same high quality, but they aren't trying to recoup money spent on R&D.  If the drugs were of a poor standard they wouldn't be allowed to sell them (since they would contain untested chemicals). Even if a molecule is just a different isomer then it can have a massive difference (e.g. thalidomide), drug standards are therefore very high. In order to extend patents companies will often try to come up with new ways to repackage or repurpose their drug. E.g. making a fast or slow absorbing version, or changing the target audience."
AdvancedFitness,2csq1t,i_use_lasers,1 point,Thu Aug 7 07:05:54 2014 UTC,"Exactly, though it's important to point out that ""generic"" refers to medications regulated by the FDA, and not supplements, which can be just about anything as long as it doesn't kill you."
AdvancedFitness,2csq1t,shAdOwArt,3,Thu Aug 14 03:15:29 2014 UTC,What does generic mean in this context? Not a big brand?
AdvancedFitness,2csq1t,ephrion,11,Wed Aug 6 22:27:24 2014 UTC,"This context, it means store brands.    For examples, the Wal-Mart Equate brands or the Sam's Club Simply Right brands for items such as pain relievers that might be called Aleve or Tylenol or Bayer, or supplements and multivitamins by brands like Centrum or Nature Made.  Generally any ""big box"" store and most grocery stores will have a generic product placed nearby the name brand product.  The reality is that occasionally the same manufacturer makes both products but labels them for sale differently and some manufacturers of generics make them for multiple generic labels.  Primarily because of the lack of advertising costs and r&d spending recoupment, the generic is not only cheaper to the consumer but often more profitable to the store to sell.  If there's a regulatory requirement on content, the generic must fit the bill and the label, so literally if the active ingredients are the same, it's just.as.good.  The general principle could be extended to smaller, cheaper brands, such as the Wal-Mart whey protein (or even buying it bulk from a bakery supply shop) instead of a more expensive brand, however."

Most of the time, I don't care about brand or generic. There are only a few drugs that I would consider brand over generic and that would only happen if I started on brand, eg Dilantin/phenytoin, Myfortic/mycophenolate. I probably wouldn't include Synthroid/levothyroxine or Coumadin/warfarin as long as you go in for blood work soon after you switch manufacturers.  But a big benefit of doing brand over generic is that there would be no or very low variability. There are times when you get a different generic manufacturer each time you have a refill. Since there is a tolerance interval for each drug, there is a chance that one generic falls higher in the tolerance interval and the next is lower. Now most of the time the drug in question has a larger therapeutic window, so switching generics or from brand shouldn't make too much difference,  but for those drugs previously mentioned, with narrower therapeutic windows, switching manufacturers can potentially be clinically significant."

AdvancedFitness,2csq1t,broscientologist,1 point,Thu Aug 7 01:23:00 2014 UTC,Interesting. I did a quick search and was unable to come up with an answer as to why this is the case for Wellbutrin or other medications.   I also question pharmaceutical companies a lot of the time knowing the power of most generic medications and the reported questionable motives for this industry. I guess for me in knowing that some prescription medications do not work/produce side or adverse effects in some people I would still be willing to try generic brands just to save myself money (and to keep huge profit from pharma companies).
AdvancedFitness,2csq1t,broscientologist,2,Thu Aug 7 02:29:52 2014 UTC,"I think it may have to do with manufacturing tolerances. I know that there are two factories that manufacture generic welbutrin. One is in California and one is in Israel. The one in Cali got shut down because the cheaper method of manufacturing they used starting yielding an innaccurate final product.  I may be wrong, but I think that a patent can run out on a compound but not on the process for making it. Other ways of making it are assumed to yield a product that is equivalent to the substance uses in the trials that showed efficacy. That is not always the case."

Even though the patent on the drug ended, the patent and the time release costing did not. A company can make its own time release coating even though that coating wasn't used in trials.  The manufactures in California was found to be unable to make the xr version. It was releasing to fast and hurting people."

AdvancedFitness,2ch9yo,Ballaticianaire,9,Sun Aug 3 04:46:56 2014 UTC,"Full text: https://www.sendspace.com/file/1rw3xc  They're essentially saying glucose deprivation falls under metabolic stress-mediated hypertrophy, whichs falls within the paradigm of lactic acid and other metabolites that challenge cellular integrity. They're saying muscular contraction at a high intensity causes arterial and venous compression (during the actual lift), that occludes the muscle from receiving nutrient rich blood flow, even in such a transient manner.  I see where they're going with this and it's actually quite enthralling. They're looking for the specific mediators of anabolic pathway signaling due to exercise.. such as the hypothesized phospolipase D expression cleaving membrane lipids to phosphatidic acid, activating mTOR. Thus, they show here that the brief glucose deprivation stimatules the mTOR pathway as well. However;  they gathered cells in a glucose-free medium at 30, 60, 120, or 180 min. I don't see anywhere near 30 mins of glucose deprivation occuring during training. During the actual contraction process, a lift MAY take 1 min, and that's on the far end. That will occur many times over during a workout, and assuming a high volume, hypertrophy-oriented routine, maybe 12 mins of glucose occlusion (assuming 45 secs/set * 16 sets). Now, 12 mins, intermittently spread out every 1-2 mins is not at all the same as 12 mins or especially 30 mins straight.  Irrespective of the times they used, and applicability to real life, I would surmise that the brief periods of glucose deprivation/nutrient rich blood flow occlusion may absolutely contribute to anabolic signaling under the paradigm of metabolic stress. Even though brief, the brief period is during the time glucose is gravely needed aka active contraction, so the effect should be augmented. This study shows that the brief deprived periods cause significant mTOR pathway during the recovery/reavailability of glucose.   They also show glucose deprivation alone robustly induces AMPK. This gives another signaling mechanism that contributes to its activation, apart from general ATP & glycogen depletion, ROS induction, and Ca2+ signaling. Further, they showed the AMPK expression didn't induce MAFbx (a ubiquitin ligase, causes muscle atrophy by degrading them via the proteasome), corroborating studies finding AMPK-alpha 2 is induced via exercise, which doesn't inhibit anabolic pathways and contribute greatly to catabolism.   Last, aiming to elucidate mechanisms by which it contributes to mTOR upregulation, they found NOS is activated, upregulating NO production, contributing greatly to the mTOR activation. It also seems the AMPK that's strongly upregulated by the glucose depri mediates the NOS induction, aiming to increase glucose uptake."
AdvancedFitness,2ch9yo,deathmangos,2,Mon Aug 4 03:16:20 2014 UTC,Maybe glucose deprivation is what's behind the hypertrophy seen in low weight blood flow restriction training?

AdvancedFitness,2ch9yo,silverhydra,5,Sun Aug 3 12:34:33 2014 UTC,"Yeah, this is not really an actionable thing.  It's like how after you eat 5,000 calories in one sitting you start to defecate out extra calories since you can't absorb it all; sure they're ""free calories"", but you just sorta ruined the benefits free calories would give you (fat loss) by splurging.  Glucose deprivation will promote mTOR activity, but so does glucose availability; the glucose availability plus leucine is a lot better of a combination for mTOR activity and subsequent muscle protein synthesis than is glucose deprivation.  Even then, without the full text we can't see incubation times or concentration of glucose; the concentration of glucose in muscle cells might be low enough that even eating only protein (via gluconeogenesis) would prevent 'deprivation induced mTOR activation'."

That being said, I can try to answer your questions (more for myself to test my knowledge):   the IT band inserts on the lateral (outside) part of your tibia, and thus abnormal tightness may lead to external rotation on the tibia (so the external rotation of the ankle being noticed may be from that). Abnormal tightness of the IT band can more likely lead to lateral tracking of your patella (a major component in many people's knee pain). A good way to test IT band tightness is the ""Ober's Test."" PT's would probably use manual muscle testing, or more accurately, dynamometer testing to see if muscles differentiate in strength. I also know a lot of problems are not necessarily based on muscle strength imbalances, and could be due to neuro recruitment pattern issues. Stretches that may help - anything on the muscles that attach at the knee. so your basic quads, hamstrings, adductors (side leaners), hip flexors (front leaners), and calves. Stretches for the glutes and IT band can be the ""thread the needle stretch,"" or the ""pigeon stretch,"" (as I've seen it been called). You can even do some stretches for the low back because we are taught the term ""regional interdependence"" which is just a fancy term for everything is connected and could relate down the chain. The rule of thumb is to treat flexibility like you would any other lifting program. Do sets to accumulate 60-90 seconds of stretch at each muscle, 2-3 times a week to see improvements. Foam rolling is also a godsend for the IT band and lower extremity, in my opinion, and may give a similar response to when you ""massage the IT band then it relieves the pain.""   As for the squat (and this comes from a background in lifting), that could be a number of things that may or may not relate to your other problems, so I won't even go into the possibilities without being able to see and evaluate in person.  Once, again, I would like to reiterate my ""lack"" of experience when it comes to Physical Therapy because I am just a student. So do not take my opinions as a diagnosis or legitimate advice. However, thanks for letting me think critically about the topic because these sorts of scenarios are how we are tested in school!"

AdvancedFitness,2cf32f,zortnarftroz,2,Sat Aug 2 18:21:16 2014 UTC,"PT student here as well: while foam rolling will feel good this is not a substitute for stretching the TFL (tensor fascia latae), which the IT band inserts to proximally, as there is no way to really stretch the IT band since it's just dense connective tissue.  Focus on stretching the muscles around it."
AdvancedFitness,2cf32f,sharkiteuthis,1 point,Sat Aug 2 19:04:50 2014 UTC,Even better if you can put the TFL in a stretched position and then wedge a lax ball between your hip and the wall and really dig into the knots.  The first time will make you cry.

There's no reason you have to put the lax ball on the floor - that position will work equally well with the lax ball pinned to the wall by your body, and it gives you more control."

Foam roll your IT band. I bet it will hurt like hell. Actually, spend half an hour a day for the next week just form rolling and taking a lacrosse ball to every single knot you can find in your leg muscles. If you want a guide for what and how to SMR, I can point you towards one."

You need to be able to work over the muscle bodies slowly, and press hard into the knots. Eventually you can work up to a PVC pipe for really tight stuff, but at first the pipe is going to be way too painful to be useful.  The cheapo all-foam rollers are fine at first, but the PVC core is much nicer because the foam ones tend to wear out and get really soft really fast.  It's all covered here."

AdvancedFitness,2cdige,Kieldro,10,Fri Aug 1 23:12:04 2014 UTC,The study does not state whether the subjects actively supinated their forearm during the curl.

AdvancedFitness,2ceipu,thechocolategunshow,3,Wed Aug 6 20:26:56 2014 UTC,"When I injured my low back, one thing that helped me a lot when I came back to squatting and dead lifting a year later was 'locking my core down' (basically bracing it. You'll feel your obliques lock up). You could look up Valsalva maneuver (sp?) too, utilising both of those made my core rock solid and now I barely worry about my injury as long as I'm smart about it. Focusing a lot on your TVA helped too, so exercises like Pallof Holds, RKC Planks, and so on were great. Oh and don't forget exercises to keep your back stretched and strong. :)"
AdvancedFitness,2ceipu,thechocolategunshow,1 point,Sat Aug 2 16:32:41 2014 UTC,"Hey thanks for the tips.  I tried the Pallof Holds and RKC planks yesterday.  I can really feel it in my obliques today.  Probably the first time I've actually been sore after a core workout in a while (usually because I don't work myself too hard to eliminate the chance of injury).  I've been focusing a lot on keeping my core/chest from lifting and arching off the bench when I do shoulder presses, bench presses etc.  It's really made a difference, I had to actually go down in weight a bit which shows how much a lot of people probably are lifting more than their core really is fit to do.  I started the Valsalva a few weeks ago already and while it seems like it's not really a workout when you read it on paper, I noticed after a week I was able to lift more without arching my back on heavier lifts.  It's part of my daily routine now, as will Pallof holds and RKC plans from now on."
AdvancedFitness,2ceipu,Gryzz,1 point,Sun Aug 3 19:55:56 2014 UTC,"Great to hear! Keep that up, progress slowly on your lifts, and you'll be stronger than ever. I did not enjoy my injury at all, but if it taught me one thing, it's to be smart when approaching big movements. And smarter means stronger in time. I credit the Valsalva Maneuver for being one of the main things to keep my back safe post-injury, I""m glad it's working for you!   If you'll be doing Pallof Holds every day, you definitely should research the exercise. I know multiple coaches have made up different versions of the exercise, and attacking the exercise from multiple angles and with other implements will make your progress even better (and keep you interested. Pallof Hold's aren't the most entertaining).   http://www.tonygentilcore.com/blog/everything-pallof-press/ here's somewhere to start, it's got a bunch of different versions. I know Dean Somerset had a circuit utilizing the Pallof Press which made it very 360-like, if that makes sense. Covers a lot more of your core."
AdvancedFitness,2ceipu,mrcosmicna,1 point,Sun Aug 3 22:04:04 2014 UTC,"Please use precaution with the valsalva maneuver.  While it may help some people, back issues vary greatly in cause and what helps one person may hurt another. Valsalva increases intra-abdominal pressure, hell that's what it's designed to do, and that actually increases the stress on your discs.   And you Probably already know that flexion will increase the stress on them as well. Any stabilization exercises that keep your spine near neutral or into some extension will be great for your core, but I think your PT and doctor would advise against valsalva."
AdvancedFitness,2ceipu,Gryzz,1 point,Wed Aug 6 04:09:34 2014 UTC,"how does the valsava increase stress on the discs? The concern is an asymmetrical stress, anyway, not ""increased"" stress. You reduce ""stress"" by taking weight off the bar.  And I think flexion due to a lack of a valsava is a greater concern in terms of disc stress than any purported inherent stress of the valsava."
AdvancedFitness,2ceipu,mrcosmicna,1 point,Sun Aug 10 09:43:05 2014 UTC,"Your abdominal cavity lies in front of your discs, not all around it. Intra-abdominal pressure pushes ""asymmetrically"" on the disc in a posterior direction (the direction almost all herniations happen). This probably isn't a huge concern for a healthy disc, but for a compromised disc it can be. Valsalva can actually be used to help diagnose a disc impingement by provoking symptoms.   As far as flexion due to a lack of valsalva, I think you shouldn't be relying on valsalva to keep you out of flexion or you might be asking for other issues. For an elite athlete with great biomechanics it could be something to look into, but that's nowhere near the normal population and definitely not someone with disc issues."
AdvancedFitness,2ceipu,Gryzz,1 point,Sun Aug 10 10:26:34 2014 UTC,"I don't agree. I think the valsava manevour is absolutely %100 necessary to avoiding flexion under load.  I have never ever seen a powerlifter or strongman not use a valsava on a limit attempt.  I see no reason not to use the valsava for the general population, too.  I don't think posterior herniation is a concern if a neutral bony alignment is preserved (ie normal lumbar lordosis).  I think this is where academia and the real world must split, as no one has ever deadlifted a heavy weight without a valsava, intentional or otherwise"
AdvancedFitness,2ceipu,mrcosmicna,1 point,Sun Aug 10 10:57:45 2014 UTC,"I see your point. I'm sure it does help those guys a bit, especially with the belt. Most people are not those guys, however, because most people can't even keep lordosis during a body weight squat due to limited hip and/or ankle mobility. I'm talking about a man who is trying to strengthen his core after a herniated disc, not a strongman competitor doing heavy squats. This guy isn't going for the world record or even a PR, he's trying to get healthy. You don't need valsalva during a plank or pallof press."

Now, since it's summer, I'll do one 90 minute row or erg in the morning followed by another hour or 90 minute row or bike/run in the afternoon, 5 days a week, all low intensity. and 1 day in the week, I'll do a longer AT workout (like 2x20' at hr 175-185)."
AdvancedFitness,2cb2w5,jawocha,1 point,Fri Aug 1 05:46:42 2014 UTC,"So you're way beyond my level of experience and tier (Just graduated High School, 6ft 170ish 626). so take my advice with a grain of salt if you will, but if I'm reading this right you're training 5 days a week. Add a 6th day even if its only every other week (and if I read it wrong, damn). It also sounds like you're doing no speed work. Yeah, its summer and will be fall, there are no sprint races, but you still have to work on that top end speed every once in a while or you're going to lose it. Dont train to go slower. At this point in the year probably every 14-21 days a short interval is okay (Even if its only 4x3minutes gotta stay in touch with speed and those pathways)  follow that workout with an easy 10-15k and you're looking at a 60-90 min session 15-20k .  Throw a 5-6x1500 10x1k @24 6k pace type workout in every other week too. Don't just do steady state and don't do it in the same band all the time. You need variation.   I think your 500 is proportionally better than your 6k so the aerobics are a little weak, so obviously play to improve endurance, but I think a lot of coaches/coaching neglects strengthing an athletes strengths. If that's where you make gains so be it. If you can fit 2 lifts a week in just for strength great. For all we know your aerobics may be going thru the roof but you've been losing strength so your speed is stagnant.   Ask a coach. You have them. Come school the workout plan will probably a little more complex and you'll be good just doing those extra SS sessions. Up the volume though instead 8 extras in 14 days do 9. ...or maybe you're volume is too much.   Edit: if you have a training log, look at when you were and werent PRing on season focus pieces , how the plan was structured the weeks even a couple months before.

If your goal is to go as fast as possible, then you'll want to slim down and that inevitably means losing muscle. Even in triathlon, having a lot of upper body mass isn't going to help you at all since swimming is 99% technique. And if you want to go really fast, I'd recommend dropping the strength training all together and spending more time on the swim/bike/run.   Source: Did weight training for 7-8 years and switched over to traithlon and cycling for ~5 years."
AdvancedFitness,2c9lzs,sevendayconstant,7,Thu Jul 31 21:30:39 2014 UTC,"Definitely.  Cycling and running are both power to weight ratio sports- and its basically impossible to be so strong that you can overcome the disadvantage of having a lot of mass- at least when it comes down to being truly competitive. Basically, you wont be competitive against folks who are serious without dropping weight.  As a cyclist I do weight training during off season and maintenance lifting during season- but it is very leg focused.  Also when as the season starts and I stop lifting I see a huge jump in my on-bike power about 3-4 weeks after stopping the heavy lifting.    Also muscle mass burns glycogen and oxygen even when you aren't directly using it.  And for endurance sports you want to minimize that burn as much as possible unless you are sprinting.  In super simple terms- your upper body will consume your fuel even though you arent doing anything strenuous with it.  That fuel will be sorely missed when your legs need it 3 hours into an event."

Leg curls keep the knee pain away by balancing out your legs.  The high reps is all about building muscular and anaerobic endurance.  During season I get in once a week and do a maintenance routine.  Lighter weights all around.  By this point in the season (basically the end here in August) I am not strong enough to do most of the weights I was doing in the off season but I still have a lot of anaerobic endurance.  Those work outs look like:   6x10 Squats  6x10 Calf Raises 3x6 Deadlifts 3x6 Inverted Row 3x6 Leg Curl 3x6 Leg Press 3x6 Bench Press core routine   This may not apply to you, but I wouldn't start weight lifting before I had a regular training routine on the bike.

AdvancedFitness,2c9lzs,TunaBoo,1 point,Thu Jul 31 20:08:49 2014 UTC,"Currently 5'8.5 and ~170 pounds, down from 180 two months earlier. Currently doing 2-3 days of lifting a week still in preparation for tough mudder, which is my first big event (I don't include the 8k and 10 mile runs before it). Afterwards, I will most likely drop some more lifting or focus more on lower body/core to prepare for the half (or even full marathon if I decide to do it, God forbid).   The triathlon is the last thing, which occurs annually on Memorial Day, so it's a ways off. What's an average/respectable olympic triathlon time for a first-timer? I'm aiming for ideally ~160 for the triathlon and swam competitively in high school. With all the running I'm doing now, the only leg I have very limited experience in is cycling."
AdvancedFitness,2c9lzs,TunaBoo,1 point,Fri Aug 1 16:33:59 2014 UTC,"Makes sense. You are not THAT heavy, your lifting will help you in a lot of ways.  Look at past results of your race and figure out what average is, and go from there. I think my firs Oly tri was something like a 3:01, trying to cut 10 or so minutes off that on my second. I am pretty happy to get somewhere around the middle overall (which is way worse than middle for my age group, but gotta start somewhere)"
AdvancedFitness,2c9lzs,TunaBoo,2,Fri Aug 1 16:50:31 2014 UTC,"Haha yeah, I looked at the results from this year and the average was slightly faster than 3:00, which is what I'm aiming for. From looking at the splits, I am (hoping) that I can get back to decent shape for swimming and surpass those times easily. The 10k times are a lot faster than mine currently and the cycling portions are up in the air.   Does lifting help very much in triathlons though? I was under the impression it didn't do for much direct help, mostly for strengthening the joints and preventing injuries."
AdvancedFitness,2c9lzs,veritasius,1 point,Fri Aug 1 17:06:30 2014 UTC,"I think so!  I see people come from running into a tri with skinny runny arms, and they are lucky to get 2:30/100m. A little bit of bicep and shoulder work seems to help me a ton. (Now bench isn't really ideal front crawl exercise, but if you do a little bench and a little skull crusher and a little lateral raises and a little bicep work, you will have a nice swim advantage).  Biking is all about quads. No squatting 600 won't make you a good biker right away because biking is an endurance sport, but it surely gives you a lot more POTENTIAL to be a good biker. Seems like your biking will develop faster with more muscle mass to work with. (maybe a little bit broscience, but my starting biking speed was a lot better than people with no quad strength).  Running you notice on the hills and around injuries. Most people are too quad dominate, and thus have shaky running form. If you also work your hammies and glutes, you will be ahead of 90% of the runners out there (in potential obviously, you won't actually beat 90% in a race YET). Just keep hammy work and learn to activate your glute while you run - faster and less injuries."
AdvancedFitness,2c9lzs,Gymrat777,1 point,Fri Aug 1 17:12:15 2014 UTC,"Mm from my swimming experience, biceps are one of the most useless (and unfortunately popularly exercised) muscles for swimming. It's primarily back and tricep, with the shoulder being incorporated significantly in an indirect manner. Upper chest is used a bit in front crawl as well. And of course, very very much core.  I would understand that biking is quad heavy. And glutes from my limited experience.   For running, I don't notice much. It's a good thing I've been working a lot on deep squats and deadlifts though :D"
AdvancedFitness,2c9lzs,muscled,1 point,Fri Aug 1 17:31:00 2014 UTC,"My not a good swimmer understanding of front crawl, I often see things such as http://www.livestrong.com/article/528812-the-muscles-used-in-a-front-crawl/   The first part of the S-curve – where the hand catches the water and begins the pull by executing a sculling motion – uses the forearm muscles and your latissimus dorsi. The middle portion of the S-curve pull works the biceps and deltoids, while the completion of the curve – the portion where the arm leaves the water – works the triceps. T   But yes you do not need huge biceps to swim fast (see crowie @ http://www.chicagonow.com/going-the-distance/files/2011/07/Boise-Crowie.jpeg )... but compare that to the arms of a marathoner meb ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Meb_Keflezighi_2009_London_Marathon-2.jpg ), and I think you want SOME kind of arm muscles.

My biggest thing right now is that with my completed tough mudder on November 1st, I will only have running events from then until February 15th. Then a triathlon at the end of May. I'm not quite sure how to tackle training, as I'd hate to lose muscle that'd be helpful in the triathlon whilst training for the halfs/full I'd be racing, only to have to work to regain them. At the same time, going into triathlon training wouldn't provide the time or mileage needed, especially as I'm doing only an oly. Sigh, I hate balancing."
AdvancedFitness,2c9lzs,bad96xx,1 point,Fri Aug 1 19:25:33 2014 UTC,"Well a few things to consider:  1) Swim training is not going to hurt anything. From a swimmer past you are strong here, but a little extra swim work will get your technique up a little. Its like 0 impact though, will not hurt your run or strength gains at all to swim a moderate amount.  2) Bike carryover is AWESOME for the run. If guy A runs 5 days a week and 40 miles, but guy B runs 4 days a week for 30 miles AND bikes 3 days a week for 5 hours.  guy B will both run faster and be in better tri shape.    3) As long as you make weights a backup priority and skip it when you are too tired, no reason you can't lift during both run and tri training.  I run races and do tris... I run way less than I used to as a pure runner, but am way faster. Thanks bike!"

I was originally planning on doing this training plan: http://www.trinewbies.com/tno_trainingprograms/tno_18wOly.asp starting in mid January, going through the full 18 weeks right up to my race.   This was originally when I only had a tough mudder in November and olympic tri in May. With a half early December, a 30k early January, and a half and full in February, how would you recommend me training, if you don't mind me asking?"
AdvancedFitness,2c9lzs,ABabyAteMyDingo,2,Fri Aug 1 21:21:52 2014 UTC,"Less so with Tough Mudder training, but serious 13.1/ triathlon training (going for a top tier or age group finish time) is going to cause some muscle loss. I'm a muscular mesomorph type and when I did serious cycling and triathlons/duathlons I lost about 8 lbs. This helped my power to weight ratio and was a necessary evil. After I stopped competing in endurance events I resumed weights again and it took me about 12 months to get back to where I was before. I never did a dexa scan to assess precisely how much of this change was muscle, but it was pretty obvious that much of the difference was the upper body musculature. I quit cycling when I was 51 and had no trouble bouncing back. You're young and elastic so if you really want to excel at the endurance stuff for awhile, go for it."
AdvancedFitness,2c9lzs,el_vetica,3,Fri Aug 1 00:37:01 2014 UTC,"You lose 2 seconds per mile while running for each extra pound of bodyweight (as a general rule of thumb). Losing 10 pounds will equate to about 4.5 minutes over a half marathon and 2 minutes for an Oly. Also, any hills on the bike and you immediately start to suffer for carrying around excess weight."

In my lighter athletes with good acceleration we look at depth drops and hurdle hops. In the bigger guys 200-220+ we look at box jumps and seated Jumps."

He called out people doing SL as skinnyfats who just aren't trying hard enough because they aren't exhausted/sweaty from doing multiple sets of 5 reps. Well guess what? When you only do a few very heavy sets you won't sweat as hard or be as exhausted (from an outside perspective) than if you did a more endurance based approach to exercise.

I've seen a dozen people seriously injure themselves by not knowing they're limitations. I think it's safer to say, train for your goals. If prolonging fatigue and sustaining effort are your goals than you should practice that. If lifting heavy is your goal, as it is mine, then do that.

AdvancedFitness,2bztjy,mrcosmicna,10,Tue Jul 29 19:25:40 2014 UTC,"This is absolute nonsense.  There is a distinction between strength training and conditioning which seems to have been forgotten here.  If you are specifically endeavouring to improve conditioning then it is essential that you target the specific energy system and work:rest ratio that your sport demands.  However if we are trying to get stronger and improve muscular hypertrophy - safely - we need to do a program that enables this to happen.  By imposing a heart rate etc on to this we are confusing the fundamental difference between strength training and conditioning.  If you start Sl5x5 and start with a 40kg squat then finish with a 140kg squat, you have got stronger, and the program has worked; regardless of what your heart rate was at any point during the program.  Encouraging people to use heart rate as a gauge of efficacy of their --strength training-- will only encourage poor technique and distract people from their goals - getting stronger.    Another example is rest periods.  Taking shorter rest periods might create a better conditioning effect and improve work capacity, but it might also jeopardise the amount of reps you hit on the next set.  If your goal is strength, then this is a poor decision.  That is why it is important to distinguish between resistance training and conditioning - they are two completely different modalities, and should be treated as such.  And for references there are ways to condition that don't impose the risks that high rep olympic lifts or barbell movements entail.  Things like prowler pushing, sprinting, or indeed rowing.  These are completely different and safer and more effective conditioning modalities than strength training to failure as your limiting factor is more likely to be conditioning, not your exercise technique, or your force production/"

I have a years worth of free gym membership and I do intervals of things like sled pulls and jumps and running up stairs with weights. I rarely see anyone else pushing themselves to the limit like I do - not in terms of work done but visible effort put in. I do this stuff in addition to running (though not on the same day as 400's or 800's).  At the same time, I do not think you would progress if you did every workout to failure (which I think would be 100% max). My high school coach said something like ""we train to race, not race to train"" and I think there is truth to that.   TLDR 90% MHR sounds good to me and has given me results."

AdvancedFitness,2bynfk,DieMafia,5,Mon Jul 28 17:34:07 2014 UTC,"PSMF or RFL limits the duration of the diet and the cheat meal/refeed frequency based on body fat percentage. At low percentages (15% or less) it's supposed to be only about 12 days max with no cheat meals and 2 or 3 refeed days at the end of it. It's pretty safe to assume that at these very low calories, you will lose muscle if you try to push beyond that. UD2.0 may be a better strategy, especially if you're already training a lot.  And that's not even going into the psychological side of it. Trust me, it's hard, I've only been successful with it once and failed to stick with it twice."
AdvancedFitness,2bynfk,infernix,1 point,Mon Jul 28 17:55:29 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your input! I wondered if I lose more muscle relative to fat compared to a traditional diet if I limit it to 10 days. I assume your answer to this would be no?  Regarding the psychological side, I did it twice already and it was fairly easy both times. Its likely because my body naturally wants to maintain a low bodyfat and I have to push myself to eat when I want to bulk. Except for a slight appetite for carbs I felt really fine both times. Actually it was more motivating to me, compared to knowing I have to cut and won't make gains for several months."

AdvancedFitness,2bynfk,RawMuscleLab,4,Mon Jul 28 22:29:57 2014 UTC,"Alright, here we go.  I tried it for around a month or so when I was bordering on 10% last year.  Did it work? Absolutely, it got me ripped pretty quick actually, so in terms of looks, I looked great. It will dry you out immensely, so there is a ""am I losing fat or am I dry?"" mentality, it's both, but remember it's both, once you introduce carbohydrate again, you'll gain water, that's how it is.  Secondly, how did I feel? I felt like utter shit unless I had to workout. For the first 4-5 days it's not nice, very hungry, weak, lathargic. Then once you start transitioning.. you feel fine. again, compared to normality, you feel like shit.  Endurance improved when I went on a run. My time got faster, I put it down to carrying less water weight (there was a point in which I felt super light, was weird). When I say faster, I cut 2 minutes off of my 12 mile hill run, and the day before, I did recarb.  Explosiveness = Gone, and when I say gone, I truly mean it. I had zero speed and power. And even though I was lifting the same weight, keeping my muscle intact and running faster.. If I tried to sprint, my god did it not only suck, I was slow.   For long distance? Great, for Sprinting and Boxing? Ha!  This is covered with guys such as Peter Attia.  One last thing.. My conditioning after PSMF sucked, now I know this is about ""reverse"" dieting and all that. But when you're 10% - 15%, and you have lean cuts in your skin, you'd expect to have the same after PSMF surely right? Well no.  Maybe I upped the calories and carbs too quickly, maybe I didn't. But when I reintroduced the carbohydrate slowly over a period of a few weeks or so, my body literally didn't know what to do with it - We're talking not for a week, but for a good few months. Even though I hadn't lost muscle, my pump was... off. Even after recarbing for a while, the pump wasn't the same.  Never looked into it, but I'm fine now after a dreamer bulk. Again it's about what type of conditioning you need in Sports, do you need to use PSMF? Because it might work fine for you, but lets say it works, but your conditioning after a while starts to suck, then what?  In my opinion, a low carbohydrate diet with PSMF days thrown in is in my eyes, a far better option. It's very similar to some people who eat 600 calories worth of protein or so and call it a fasting day, except you'll be getting around 1000.  And if you enjoy cardio, it's better to have some carbs in your diet with slightly more calories to enable you to sweat it out properly."

Pretty much unlimited green fibrous vegetables although you don't feel like eating many.  It also recommends a heap of essential vitamin supplements to take along with it too. Training volume is cut wayyyyyy back and is basically two whole body workouts as heavy as you can go (I use RPT style of training) per week.

It's a brutal diet which limits how much physical activity you will be able to do (aside from walking). It is not recommended for active athletes at all. The hunger pains are intense (and will make you double over) and you can pass out from prolonged dieting.  Your current body fat is assigned to a category (under 15% is Category 1), and Cat 1 dieters are advised to do a maximum of 2 weeks or deal with possible hormonal consequences.  If you are dead-set on losing fat, it is recommended to RFL down to 15% bodyfat, and then move on to Ultimate Diet 2.0 (which is a lot of diet/training micro-management)."

UD 2.0 uses tricks such as refeeds, calorie cycling, and carb timing to minimize muscle loss.  If you are already under 15%, I would just do UD2.0. Or, a 2-week run of RFL, maintenance for 10-14 days, and UD 2.0.  RFL is massively easier once you get past the first few days, you also get a good feel of the difference between hunger and appetite. It actually makes your life easier knowing you can just eat super-lean protein items. UD 2.0 is much more intensive, and requires a lot of micro-management and timing to get things right. It is designed for those trying to get to very low body-fat levels while maintaining LBM.  Remember that on RFL you should not exceed 20g of fat or carbs a day, and those should only come from trace calories of high-protein products. It's not easy. Most people will not be able to adhere to it, and most of those who do end up binging when they switch off the diet."

There is a bunch of literature indicating that the diaphragm plays an important role in low back pain, but no (peer-reviewed) consensus on what that role is, just that co-morbidity between LBP and poor diaphragm position and function is high. I can dig those up if you're interested.  Some people will give you functional anatomy arguments that, for example, the abs are intended primarily to resist rotation, and their secondary function is trunk flexion, and that the external obliques primarily resist extension, with a secondary function of trunk rotation, etc. I, personally, believe that this is the case, but I don't know of any literature that either supports or disproves this. (I guess you could just stick electrodes in some poor saps and have them do pallof presses, but that kind of reductionist experiment isn't going to tell the whole story either.)

Therefore if you have been training ten years already, then it doesn't matter what program you are on those adaptations occurred ages ago and don't apply (as much).  It's not a simple thing, therefore, to say that smolov is a neuro program. Maybe, maybe not.   Now, you say two conflicting things. One, that your coach said to focus on growth, and two that you were seeing ""gains"" and getting ""stronger"". So which do you want? Growth = hypertrophy and may or may not include strength gains. Strength increases may or may not include some hypertrophy. Which do you want? A program mainly for getting bigger or one for getting stronger?

Beneficial effects of regular exercise on sleep may be explained by multiple pathways with the interaction of circadian rhythm, metabolic, immune, thermoregulatory, vascular, mood and endocrine effects. Except for its psychological patterns, the effects of sleep loss on exercise performance appear inconclusive.

Some people paint the picture that they pop a melatonin and pass out 45 minutes later, unable to hold their eyelids up.  This is a bit of embellishment, since melatonin isn't a sedative.

Bottom line - there are no reliable tests available at the moment.   It is thought that about 50% of variance in athletic ability could be explained by genetics, but current research into common genetic variants can only explain a tiny fraction of this. The presenter (Professor Yannis Pitsiladis) basically said all his research to date had been fruitless. They were learning loads, but that no reliable predictors have been found.   There are a couple genes that have been linked with athletic performance (e.g. alpha actinin-3 (ACTN3) R577X) that you can pay to test for, but it won't tell you a whole lot other than that you may be more suited to endurance or power sports.   Athletic ability / potenetial is way more complex than a single gene and at present that's all we really know about - the odd gene or two.

AdvancedFitness,2bsyqr,Fartsss,0,Sun Jul 27 05:17:12 2014 UTC,"A theory I have is your potential risk of injury and how healthy you are. Athletic ability is limited by how your body is correctly aligned and having low risk for disease.  For example, being born with flat feet, extreme valgus of the knees, misalignment of the spine (ex scoliosis), poor posture are examples of limitations preventing one from performing the sport. This is because it will cause pain and it is pain that will limit the ability. This is why it's important to train young to correct these problems.   Physiologically, if you had asthma, congenital heart disease...or as simple as lack of critical nutrients to perform, then it's impossible to be an ""athlete"" because the condition is pulling you backwards or you put yourself in a dangerous situation(sudden death due to congenital heart defect.)  But athletes get injured all the time, right? And they also can persevere with asthma too, right?  Yes, but mainly because they push themselves to the max then get injured, whereas MOST non athletes, may hurt themselves much earlier on.  In summary, whether genetics testing is necessary or important, ultimately it's going to be about proper training anyway, since you can train yourself into an athlete if that is your passion. But to answer your question the easiest way is to observe your own family'a athletic tendencies. Another way if to see if you mainly carry more fast or slow twitch fibers....but this type of testing is not feasible (cost, discomfort), when you can train yourself into turning the slow into fast, vice versa."

The entire thing is a bit off.  They really didn't do much and most of their figures are just protocol and schemes, not data.   In the current study, the observed changes mainly occurred in the soleus muscle which is predominantly composed of type 1 (slow twitch) muscle fibers, with a preference for oxidative metabolism as an energy source. In contrast, the gastrocnemius contains a relatively higher proportion of type 2 (fast twitch) fibers which tend to rely more on anaerobic energy sources (Edgerton et al. 1975; Scott et al. 2001).    This is a bit mis-leading.  So depending on source Soleus is about 80% slow twitch. So that part is on.  But the gastrocnemius depending on source is about 50-60% slow twitch (1).  It is a great muscle to study due to this fact.  I am not sure if you can say anything about vasculature or mitochondrial function based on blood flow and CO2 levels using these 2 muscles.   In conclusion, dietary inorganic nitrate reduces the tissue oxygenation maximal change in skeletal muscle to physical exercise, with a more prominent effect at lower intensities and within muscle groups with predominantly type 1 fibers. This is consistent with a primary effect on mitochondrial efficiency rather than a vascular effect (Fig. 4).   The reference a lot of papers that look at the mitochondria but I didn't see anything that they did that would distinguishes between the two.  As type 1 fibers are more highly vasculurized it is hard to say if the effect of reduced O2 change is due to an increased mitochondrial effiency or simply blood flow.  They try to pass it off as if the two muscle groups are complete opposites, when as far as I know they aren't.  It just erked me.    Cool find, really like vasculature studies."

The short 60-90 second rests they refer to here are to maximize hypertrophy, but people who train for strength rest between 3-5 minutes between sets. So really it is up to you and what your goals are, but I think the difference is pretty negligence, especially if your current plan is having a positive mental effect. Even the article says the most important thing is effort and volume, so I say just keep lifting and cleaning!"

However, another way to look at is that if you are doing it this way and it is making you happy and you enjoy it, keep doing it. It amounts to what your goal is.  If your goal is just to get bigger/stronger, then I think you should look more ""scientifically"" at your rest times. If your goals are to look good, feel good, get stronger and get the damn house clean, it sounds like you may have developed a groundbreaking scheme. Sometimes small idiosyncrasies are what enable us to follow our program."

AdvancedFitness,2bl8eq,beniro,3,Thu Jul 24 19:03:34 2014 UTC,"I did, including:   That said, the paucity of controlled studies on the topic make it difficult to draw concrete conclusions. Certainly we know that shortening the duration of rest between sets increases metabolic stress, which is known to stimulate muscle remodeling. We also know that well-trained individuals such as bodybuilders are able to sustain a high percentage of their repetition maximum with rest periods as short as a minute. Could the combination of these factors may provide an additional hypertrophic stimulus — albeit a small effect — over time in well-trained subjects? Could other factors such as increased hypoxia and cell swelling also contribute to such a response?   I said:   You may be missing out on a bit of growth, potentially.   Then I proceeded to validate the approach, only suggesting that this scattershot approach could be limiting progress due to its ""unscientific"" nature. If ""progress"" is her one and only goal, get scientific.  So which part do you disagree with?"
AdvancedFitness,2bl8eq,heavilyarmedclown,2,Thu Jul 24 19:48:49 2014 UTC,Are you trying to maximize hypertrophy above all else? If not I wouldn't worry about it at all.

AdvancedFitness,2bl8eq,Wafflecone416,1 point,Thu Jul 24 18:19:11 2014 UTC,"Based on this article you may be limiting hypertrophy to a small degree, but there is a need for more studies to confirm that. Conversely, it's also possible you're not limiting yourself at all as long as you're giving 100% effort in every set. Even if you are limiting yourself the amount of hypertrophy you're missing out on is most likely extremely minimal, especially if you've only been lifting consistently for eight months.  You are however in optimal ranges for maximum strength gains so you should take solace in that."
AdvancedFitness,2bl8eq,philfillman,0,Fri Jul 25 05:22:43 2014 UTC,Keep doing what you're doing. I don't know specifically about SL but Starting Strength is a very similar program which recommends ~5 minute rests between sets. And if it helps your mood/self-esteem then I would say that that is more important than anything else anyway.

AdvancedFitness,2bkqdj,eric_twinge,5,Thu Jul 24 19:13:17 2014 UTC,"Well, it does give some indication of fitness level, and it's easy to administer. However, I prefer the tests which are relevant to the the physical demands of the service.  A super skinny person who's a good runner could probably perform very well on this test. But what happens when he puts on combat gear weighing +20kg (45 lbs)? I have no idea what kind of gear the armed forces in Singapore have, but if it's similar to that of many NATO countries, it could even be around 50kg (110 lbs). How fast is that skinny guy then? Or how fast will his back break when walking around with all that gear for days and weeks on end? If he is down on the ground, can he even get up? Can he drag a wounded comrade with combat gear on?  I think the Canadian test posted by AmyBlades is heading somewhat in the right direction. You want to establish what kind of physical demands your service will put on you, and then test the physical qualities needed for that.  In my opinion a good test for any armed forces could test the following:   Core strength. Planks and side planks are good. Core strength is vital for preventing injuries while carrying heavy equipment. A soldier dropping out, not being able to participate in training, or perform duties, due to back injuries, is worthless. Weighted lunges. Because, that is what you do, a shit load of the time, as a soldier with kit on. It also tests leg strength very well. Something simulating dragging a wounded comrade on the ground. This would test the objective, non-body weight related, strength. Maybe something along the lines of the exercise in the Canadian test. Cardio, preferably with a weighted vest on. Could be tests for shorter distances as well as longer distances. Could also be oriented towards combat specific cardio, such as going from being in prone position, with equipment on, to running 10-20m, and repeating.   A good test will of course also be adjusted for different levels. An Air Force technician doesn't have to be able to perform at the same level as an Army ranger. For more demanding units, weights should be increased for all exercises, etc."

It may decrease your performance, it may be harder to stick to the diet, you may be more prone to binging when or if you mess up, etc.  also ""subjects were advised to cut fat and carbs and keep their protein intake stable"" doesn't exactly sound like they were tightly controlling all their variables.   I think in the end the best approach is the one where you lose the most fat BUT are still able to maintain performance and stick to the diet. Not just the diet that gives the greatest fat loss in the shortest amount of time."

That might not be statistically significant simply for the fact that the sample size was low. I don't really see how they were able to make sure there is a 300 kcal deficit, trying to reach such a low number on your own is quite difficult. If you only consume e.g. 150 kcal per day more, that would half the rate of fat loss. And again, because of low sample size, the fat loss might be proportional to the other group but not significant. It is to be expected that people on a higher deficit lose more mass and fat.  I would like to see the following: Compare a consumption of 600 calories a day, 1200 calories a day, 1800 calories a day for 4-8 weeks in trained athletes that do strength training. Of course protein has the highest priority of macros and doesn't get cut out. Do people on the very low calorie diet lose proportionally more muscle compared to fat?"
AdvancedFitness,2bd1ii,omicronpersei69,5,Tue Jul 22 03:30:35 2014 UTC,"What is wrong with the “calories in = calories out” model of thinking? Let’s start with the Law of Thermodynamics (AKA the Law Of Conservation of Mass).  Your 9th grade science teacher told you it is an irrefutable fact; energy can neither be created nor destroyed.  The law (of which there are 4) is indeed undeniable but not when it comes to the human body. The idea that “a calorie is a calorie” comes from a misunderstanding of the laws. Here is what the 1st law of Thermodymanics states:  “In a thermodynamic process the increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system, minus the increment of work done by the system on its surroundings. This states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed. However, energy can change forms, and energy can flow from one place to another. The total energy of an isolated system remains the same.”  The major problem with the application of this law to the human calorie model is that our bodies are not isolated systems.  Far from it.  The fat storage and muscle creation structures in our bodies are not closed loops. They interact with the digestive, endocrine and circulatory systems in addition to thousands of other biological processes.  Not all of the calories that are actually in a food will be absorbed, digested and available for the body to use. When we eat a calorie it is not always used for energy or stored as fat.  Sometimes it is left unused and excreted. Up to 15% of your total daily food intake may end up in the toilet.  Certain ingredients can actually block the absorption of nutrients (molasses, calcium and fiber – the granddaddy of calorie blockers).  Some types of fiber bind nutrients in the gut and decrease their absorption. This absorption block happens not only with micronutrients (calcium, iron, etc) but also with protein and fat.  Additionally, some of the food we ingest is fermented by the bacteria in our gut; their calories simply become unavailable for us to absorb.  These calories are actually burned off by the bacteria that are living inside us.  Recent evidence suggests that our ability to derive calories from food depends significantly on the microbes we carry inside us."
AdvancedFitness,2bd1ii,dpjoachim,3,Wed Jul 23 21:42:45 2014 UTC,"The only conditions where CICO may not seem applicable are certain endocrinological disorders... But even then, the laws still apply. It's just the 'calories out' side of the equation is altered."
AdvancedFitness,2bd1ii,LawrenceJudd,5,Tue Jul 22 10:35:31 2014 UTC,"Or malabsorption affecting ""CI""... but regardless, for the vast majority the concept stands."
AdvancedFitness,2bd1ii,austinb,3,Tue Jul 22 13:01:35 2014 UTC,"Conservation of energy (what everyone likes to call ""law of thermodynamics"") is always obeyed.  However, there's a difference between conservation of energy and what most people mean by ""calories in calories out."" Contrary to popular belief, you do not absorb every calorie you put in your mouth. Also people have different metabolisms that not only vary between individuals, but even within individuals. It can depend on your current habits including but not limited to current and historical diet/activity (for instance, a severe calorie deficit for some time will lower metabolism and increases sensitivity to storing energy in the event of a calorie surplus; diet can also change the bacteria in your gut which is partly responsible for certain types of nutrient absorption).  However, that being said, counting the calories you eat is a good (what us scientists call) zeroth or first order approximation. In other words, barring a real metabolic or hormonal malfunction, calorie counting is going to exhibit the largest effect; all the other things are much more minor. It's why it's so successful and still the primary method of weight modification"

AdvancedFitness,2bd1ii,NearPost,3,Tue Jul 22 03:40:52 2014 UTC,"The thermic effect is what makes me wonder. If at 6 ft 300 pounds he has a bmr of say 2600. At 200 calories a cup, he'd have to eat 13 cups of rice a day to just maintain his weight without working. In a climate that averages 86 degrees a day. It seems odd to be able to hold that weight. Especially considering he was a subsistence farmer. My parents didn't enjoy white rice regularly until they came to the states in the late 80's. Food should have been more scarce in my grandfathers time. He shouldn't have had access to that much food on a daily basis. Or is rice just genuinely that easy to store as fat?"

Grandpa didn't work as hard on the farm as we think.  He stored his fat in a way that makes him look like he was bigger than he actually was. Also, energy expenditures drops with age.

AdvancedFitness,2bd1ii,PigDog4,6,Tue Jul 22 16:22:28 2014 UTC,"Considering that the way we calculate calories is by literally burning food in a controlled fire, it's very inaccurate.  Your gut microbiota and hormone milieu play a far greater role in physiology than calories in vs out. It's a good marker for a general idea of energy potential but is about as accurate as the BMI scale.  Yeah thermodynamics blah blah can't get around it, ultimately yes that is true in a certain sense, but the huge amount of responses possible from the virtually unlimited combinations of micro nutrients, macro nutrients, DNA, and bacteria will be what determine how fast and where those nutrients are being stored."
AdvancedFitness,2bd1ii,Leshow,3,Tue Jul 22 23:43:02 2014 UTC,"Calories used to be measured by burning food in a bomb calorimeter. In 1990 the NLEA mandated calories be calculated from food components using the Atwater system, which attempts to account for and estimate the number of actual useable calories in a food product. (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-food-manufacturers/) The values of each macronutrient were determined by bomb calorimeter, but the Atwater system attempts to adjust for fiber content and also ""digestibility coefficients"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atwater_system#Apparent_digestibility_coefficients). While still not perfect, it is much closer than burning food in a bomb calorimeter and going ""lol good enuff!""  A good example of this is wood. Under a bomb calorimeter, wood contains a lot of calories. However, if you were to eat wood (lol penis joke), you would die. This is because wood is mostly fiber, which doesn't count as digestible calories under the Atwater system.  So while the reported caloric value of a food product is still just an educated guess, it's much more accurate than the measure from a bomb calorimeter. You can also think about what your body is doing to estimate adjustments to your intake. Are you taking fairly regular and ""normal"" urinations and bowel movements? Then the reported value is probably fairly accurate. If you're having loose, greasy stools, vomiting, or any other type of discharge, then you're probably not absorbing the full caloric intake of your food."

I had a friend who is 5'9 and 220 and has the exact same maintenance calorie requirements as me. that doesn't mean the law of conservation is different for him than me, it just means his body has different baseline requirements."

The problem the law is both as simple as it looks, and a lot more complicated then people give it credit for. The complicated part is figuring out the values. While calorie-in is fairly easy to figure out (look at the food) calorie out is varies from person to person depending on all sorts of factors from genetics, to activity levels, to disease, to the kind of bacteria in your stomach helping you digest your food. People tend to simple plug in their height, weight, age, and a (usually wildly inaccurate) guess as to their body fat and expect the number to come out to be accurate, when many times it has nothing to do with their body's true expenditures."

There are numerous studies touting the benefits of vitamin D supplementation but very few are reliable. Because we get a healthy dose of natural D from the sun, milk, wild fish, mushrooms, eggs and some cereals, researchers would have to ensure their experimental group are not exposed to these things.  Complicating matters is the fact we all metabolize D at differing rates.  It becomes very difficult, if not impossible, to control these variables and compare research groups.  There are very few large, controlled, double-blind, randomized trials testing the true beneficial effects of Vitamin D in the human body.  The majority of the research is observational/epidemiology, which draw correlations not causations.  Dr. David Agus stated one of his arguments against vit. D supplementation in his book ""End of Illness"" this way:  “When your cells are deluged with vitamin D…they will pull back on their sensitivity to vitamin D by reducing their number of receptors for vitamin D. But if there’s a perceived shortfall of vitamin D in the bloodstream, your cells will up-regulate— create more receptors for vitamin D— to become more sensitive to every vitamin D molecule that passes by. What happens, then, when we consume lots of vitamin D from unnatural sources such as supplements? (I use the term unnatural to imply that it’s not coming from the sun, which is a source of vitamin D that has built-in regulatory mechanisms.) No doubt our bodies are adept at adjusting using their feedback loops as I just described, and the constant surplus of vitamin D means our cells are constantly down-regulating. If we took the supplemental vitamin D away, our cells would up-regulate to make up the difference. Vitamin D has multiple downstream signaling molecules, for the vitamin D receptor signals several reactions.”  Most people will be fine if they eat some mushrooms, eggs and fish and sprinkle a little sunlight on their bodies."

AdvancedFitness,2ap86s,Wafflecone416,2,Tue Jul 15 02:05:15 2014 UTC,Both groups were instructed to have a controlled eccentric phase so this study only measured the difference in strength gains for two different concentric phase velocities.
AdvancedFitness,2ap86s,Asiriya,2,Tue Jul 15 06:09:15 2014 UTC,I wonder if this applies to other lifts. My friend always said to go slow on bicep curls and anecdotally it seemed to work; but that could be because I wasn't swinging it to cheat it up etc...
AdvancedFitness,2ap86s,YouGuysAreHilar,2,Tue Jul 15 11:52:53 2014 UTC,"I would assume you are doing bicep curls with the main goal of bicep muscle growth, not improvements in your ability to bicep curl. The reason you go slow on bicep curls is to focus on ensuring that you are contracting your biceps well and using your bicep muscles to move the weight in order to increase hypertrophy in your biceps, which is a very different concept than what this study is about."
AdvancedFitness,2ap86s,onemessageyo,2,Tue Jul 15 16:24:11 2014 UTC,"That's because you increase your time under tension, and because you're going slow you can ensure that the tension is on the bicep, where you want it, not in your delts/serratus anterior, abs/hip muscles. If you could be as precise with a faster curl, it might be more effective, but that's kind of out of the scope of this study. Very different topics."

AdvancedFitness,2ao05y,AhmedF,15,Mon Jul 14 13:59:37 2014 UTC,"So they're using bands that add enough resistance to the pushups so they can only do 6 reps, if I understand correctly. If that is the case then it seems like a viable option for beginners. But I feel like I'd have a hard time finding bands that add the equivalent of 275-315lbs of weight, and even if I could find bands like that I feel like they'd tear/pinch my back terribly."

AdvancedFitness,2ao05y,gnuckols,3,Wed Jul 16 16:30:50 2014 UTC,"200 pound bands are pretty easy to find in any of the major brands and you can always use more than one band.  Due to shoulder problems and a few pec tears, the only flat work I have done for a few years is DB bench and weighted / banded pushups. It's not hard to modify a weighted vest so that the bands glide smoothly over that and not your back. Plus that way you have the option of adding both weights and bands. Just something to think about for anyone looking for other chest options."
AdvancedFitness,2ao05y,Hvse,2,Wed Jul 16 14:50:55 2014 UTC,"GoFit and BodyElastics sell band packs that will stack up towards 200lbs (I know amazon has individual GoFit Bands up to 80lbs) and then you get to double it because you're pulling both ends.   So getting that weight in bands is possible, but I concur that it would be a bit of a hassle.   Plus I think all of the bands would be too long to really get in the power range during pushups."

The fact that strength gains where the same between 6RM pushup and 6RM bench press is to be expected.

My technique is great except for trills (very fast alternation between two adjacent notes) in my right hand. My left hand can play trills amazingly but I'm right handed so that doesn't make sense. I've spent over a hundred hours practicing trills since January with my right hand but with very little if any improvement. I've tried all sorts of different techniques and consulted the advice of other keyboardists.
AdvancedFitness,2ahc2h,Ewitsallsticky,1 point,Sat Jul 12 03:04:54 2014 UTC,"That's because isolated finger technique doesn't work in the long run without the support of the rest of the body.    How ""strong"" do you consider your 4th and 5th fingers in relation to the rest?  It they are noticeably weaker, that immediately tells me there is something off with your technique.  They should be as strong, if not stronger once you understand how to coordinate them."
AdvancedFitness,2ahc2h,HubrisXXL,1 point,Mon Jul 14 18:00:16 2014 UTC,"Hubris is right. I'd be more concerned with the the signals from your brain/brain stem not getting to your fingers fast and strong enough.   Could be from locked up neck muscles putting slight strain or pressure on nerves or from a disc in your cervical spine being out of whack. Or maybe neither of these. But I'd bet money you have something going on in your cervical spine, especially given the fact that it's your dominant hand so we can probably rule out the non-dominant clumsiness. (And that you're probably an amazing pianist already...)  Have you been in a car accident? Fallen on your back? Slept weird? Neck pains? Are your hips out of alignment? Do you hold one shoulder slightly higher than the other? Go see a chiro who will measure your vertebrae and use science to show you why there's a problem.

I remember having difficulty with a trill at age 11 but that may have been just because I was still a beginner in my overall technique. I remember first encountering left hand trills in music at age 16 and pretty soon after a little practice more or less mastering them while my right hand still struggled.   I don't have pain anywhere, not even in my hands after my practicing for hours. I get slight irritation in my right shoulder after practice however I've noticed. It's not pain or numbness. It's more like an itch but under the skin.   I went to a doctor last month who then sent me to a physical therapist.

If you're comparing dominant and non-dominant hands and you've been comparing just six months of playing versus 20 years of playing, well that is in and of itself a huge issue. That's a lot of time for the neutral and muscular development of your dominant hand.  So then the question is, how can I develop my non-dominant hand to play as equally as my dominant? In short tie your dominant hand to your back and do everything with the other.  No really. Get your cerebellum to start your non-dominant side to fire more and you're neuromuscular junctions to accept and fire more and more forcefully. Brush your teeth, etc. It's frustrating but I bet you'd see a difference in ones month of you stopped using your dominant hand.  Try it!"

So an increase in grip, shoulder and upper back strength will help.  Just don't do too much grip training at first because you might get hurt.  The other thing is to confirm in your playing that you are efficiently using leverages to your advantage.  If you just ""play with your fingers"" and don't the rest of the kinetic chain, up through your shoulders and trunk, it's harder to achieve the same dynamics that you can achieve with ""just the hands"".  It's a simple matter of configuring your posture and technique so that you more efficiently use the entirety of the trunk in your playing."

Your left hand is playing full hand block chords, while your right hand is more focused on quick single note runs. It leaves your hands unbalanced. So when you attempt a trill, which requires a lot of wrist strength, then your right hand is just weaker than your left.   I've made some progress just doing bass lines with my right hand, but my trill is still super weak, so I don't think it's helped quite enough."

AdvancedFitness,2ae0f9,Therbin,20,Fri Jul 11 01:58:45 2014 UTC,"My golden rule: don't train for time periods that are longer than your match. Give or take a few rounds/minutes.  Let's assume your fight is 3 x 5 minute rounds. You might want to work the bag for 2 rounds light and easy to warm up then finish with 3 hard rounds to simulate the fight pace. As comp day draws closer you will start decreasing the number of warm up rounds/minutes and start opting for your fight day warm up followed by max intensity on the bag.   I don't advise people to do things like 10k runs for fight prep. Let's say you're a really fast 10k runner. 45 minutes of road time does not simulate 15 minutes of fight time. I send my athletes out for 1 5k run per week and I tell them to go fast, depending on fitness and experience I'll get them doing a few sprints to finish that off.   As for lifting, keep the weight heavy and the bar speed fast. Powerlift and Olympic lift but remember that they are there to supplement your skills training, not replace it. I tell all my athletes the same thing: train to fight, don't fight to train. If in doubt, wrestle.

AdvancedFitness,2ae0f9,crunkashell2,5,Sat Jul 26 10:10:53 2014 UTC,"So I can absolutely talk about this. I trained mma for 3 years and had a professional strength and conditioning coach. I have 3 pro fights.   Basically for cardio conditioning you want to limit it to 5 minute rounds with 60s rest between. There's two primary things we did and I'll talk about the other stuff after.   First, simplest one: five minute round repeats on the treadmill. Run at a fairly difficult pace for 5 minutes. Rest 60s, increase speed and incline, run again. Repeat. I was up to about 5 rounds at my peak. This is not fun. You can't cheat the treadmill.   The second requires a bit more explanation. Basically it breaks down into this format:   60s sprint  60s Exercise  Sprint  Exercise  Sprint    60s rest.   Each is a minute so as you can see it works out to a 5 minute round. The sprint is fast, almost uncomfortably. The exercise is what ever you want, we did stuff like dumbbell thrusters, burpees, renegade rows, reverse crunches, jump squats. You have 60s to do the exercise, I'd recommend doing enough reps to get you about 30 or 40 seconds in and take the last seconds to breath a bit.   The last things we did we barbell complexes for muscular endurance (vice aenerobic). Lots of literature online about it but it's basically a set of 4 to 6 exercises doing 4 to 6 reps each without putting the bar down.   If you have any questions let me know."
AdvancedFitness,2ae0f9,in_charge_here,2,Fri Jul 11 12:40:55 2014 UTC,"One question that I have is why is it limited to 5 min rounds? are you limiting this because it is what you are going to have to do in the real fight?

Everyone seems to be on the same page that the ""good"" calories are better fuel for doing work.    On the other hand, many people who concentrate on weight loss will only pay attention to the total number of calories, independent of their source.  I think it would be a lot more useful to learn if consuming the same number of ""good"" calories or ""bad"" calories has the same or different results on weight loss.  Either that or I'd like to see the study performed at the macronutrient level.  They should take a standard macro athlete plan, like 25% fat/50% carbs/25% protein, and then do the trial again with one diet plan hitting 25/50/25 with ""clean"" foods and the other hitting it with ""junk"" foods.  THEN we could say if food quality is important or not for athletes."

I would be remiss if I didn't point you in the direction of the glute guru himself, Brett Contreras. If you want to strengthen your glutes then that's whose stuff you need to read.

Sometimes when you hurt yourself, the tissues can heal up just fine, but your brain decides to associate certain movements that used to stress the damaged tissue with pain. The threshold for nociception to create pain is lowered, and thus you get chronic pain. The first step is usually to get the patient to understand that pain does not necessarily mean you're doing damage."

I'm sure that's addressed in some of those articles though so I'll see what they have to say."
AdvancedFitness,29z6tc,Wafflecone416,2,Mon Jul 7 02:28:40 2014 UTC,"The point is there are a number of factors that influence the perception of pain.  Mechanical damage to the tissues is important, but psychosocial environment is perhaps even more important.  Most doctors will not order an MRI for acute, non-specific low back pain without red flags (ie cauda equina syndrome) because it has been deemed not predictive of return to normal activity, and actually inhibits it (ie people see how fucked up their back is - this influences perception of pain and return to normal activity).  This is all addressed in I think the first article: 'the fall of the postural biomechanical model'.  And no, there's little to no evidence to support poor sitting/resting posture as causative of pain.  There is good evidence that constant movement throughout the day through a variety of different resting postures helps, though.  And in an athletic populace with pain, you need to look at mechanical considerations first.  Lifting technique, if they lift, will be the first concern, followed by whatever else they do under load.  This is because an athlete stresses their body in a different manner than a sedentary person."

AdvancedFitness,29xug5,bleuskeye,8,Sun Jul 6 02:17:00 2014 UTC,"Ido Portal's input (source: his FB):   So everybody and their sister sent me this video as the biggest revelation in physical culture since the invention of the plate loaded barbell. Well, no.  Let me give you my opinion here, it is multifaceted:   The video shows poor athletes but also poor classical dancers, in general. Classical dancers never impressed me with the height of their jumps but did with the quality of some of their landings. They engage in a quad dominant jumping pattern that looks artistically impressive but jump height, length, power expression and the utilitarian aspect of jumping is poor. The looks is that of a BMW but the engine is that of a Russian Lada Zhiguli. Real jumping - not for art, is done with the posterior chain. Period. It is true that athletes have poor landings more often than not. Its also true that the landings by some dancers are better - for example the one leg landing but the two feet landings in the fifth ballet stance is a forced poorly aligned structural concept that shows the dark side of ballet and how it WAS NEVER about healthy biomechanics. Many many many pay the price in older ages. Its true that athletes can learn to articulate the landing better, but its not a ballet concept solely, its a MOVEMENT concept.  The quad and gastroc dominant jumping in ballet help the dancers with their landings as these are some of the prime actors in landing biomechanics. The more posterior chain oriented athletic jumping requires sometimes a different musculature for landing than from take off. Dancers are approaching the study and perfection of the landing phase with more MOVEMENT tools than athletes who are operating on a lower vocabulary level in the language of movement. Its not about dance, its about the movement, again. Contemporary dancers for example will use a completely different set of foot positions and orientations than ballerinas but will still enjoy similar superiority in the quality of their landings compared to a soccer player. Its not the ballet, its not the contemporary dance, its about attention to movement. Athletes are much poorer movers than dancers on average.  Dancers train a lot barefoot or in minimal ballet shoes. Athletes spend a lot of time in cushioned shoes. The ballerina's foot is an extremely developed piece of work, perhaps some of the best athletic feet and ankles in the world. The athletes - atrophied feet, collapsed arches, cramped toes. So, is it really surprising that they land like a sack of shit with those supporting instruments?  Of course not many ACL injuries in ballet compared to CHAOTIC, unexpected, high risk, against adversaries, under bigger loads sports. Cant believe people fall for such statements. Come on, folks.   I've studied Ballet in the past. I was an athlete all my life. I have many students who are professional dancers as well as many elite athletes. I've provided cross-disciplinary exchange and used with my students concepts from both areas and many others. Its nice to see people waking up and realizing that a certain discipline has a lot to offer them even if they are not interested in the discipline but to recap, it is important to realize these points: * It is about movement, not ballet, not dance * Some pros but some cons - no one discipline got it right cause non of them are devoted to MOVEMENT without any other dogmas skewing things * The fact you can jump well doesn't mean you can land well and vise versa  There you go, some thoughts on a not so simple matter. Hope this is useful to you, Ido."

AdvancedFitness,29xug5,mrcosmicna,8,Sun Jul 6 21:31:08 2014 UTC,"I think teaching an athlete who has jumping or agility demands to be in really good eccentric control is one of the most important aspects of preparation. Proper strength training will teach this very well, especially squats and the power versions of the olympic lifts (even though they are concentric they do teach proper triple extension), but teaching an athlete to land and decelerate ""quietly"" and with good mechanics is also an important skill to prevent both acute and chronic (tendinitis) injury.  Conditioning is also pretty important.  But I do still think the best way to prevent both contact and non-contact ACL tears is through more strength.  Thanks for the interesting study; it shows the importance of proper skill acquisition and work capacity."
AdvancedFitness,29xug5,El_Duder,6,Sun Jul 6 02:44:30 2014 UTC,I work a lot with my athletes on eccentric mechanics like you're talking about because ACL tears are so frequent and standard methods of training focus so heavily on concentric movement.

AdvancedFitness,29xug5,mrcosmicna,1 point,Sun Jul 6 04:30:33 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the only problem with depth jumps however are they a quite demanding modality due to the high force requirements and can negatively effect lower limb recovery for strength/conditioning/skill modalities.

AdvancedFitness,29xug5,nednerbf,3,Sun Jul 6 18:25:00 2014 UTC,"I have worked with multiple female dancers in the past and there is a huge disparity in their body awareness and movement mechanics. A lot of the time they are hyper mobile and lack any ability to stabilize under any significant demand.  Due to the way a lot of dance is taught it seems that these girls arent so much taught how to move correctly as just jam into their joints and survive. A lot of them are very easily coachable but it takes a long time to teach them to stabilise their spine instead of breaking into over extension.    The dancers I have worked with that did well though were often ones that stopped dancing at a young age but carried on into different sports. In a sense it allowed them to stiffen up a bit but forced their bodies to not get so beaten up which dance definitely does once you get to a certain age.   Another big issue I found with ex dancers is because they spent so much time with their toes pointed out and with the hip forced into external rotation, they never learned to correctly stabilise the joint. Because of this, unfortunately when they have to squat or jump in a position that doesnt have their feet turned totall out, the knee collapses valgus."

AdvancedFitness,29vqzi,fremeer,2,Sat Jul 5 17:44:48 2014 UTC,Isn't the general rule that the cns is huge prime motivator for strength and power? Basically ur body can lift quite a bit with the muscle you already have but the cns is not good at recruiting muscle at a fast enough rate. The more you practice specific movements the quicker and harder you can all that movement even with muscle staying consistent. Muscle level goes up in response to external stimuli but nearly always the cns has to recruit the new muscle too. Submaximal loads allow working the muscle to failure even if the cns hasn't been trained to handle the load.    That's what I've pieced together anyway.

AdvancedFitness,29r90r,TitaniumBranium,13,Thu Jul 3 17:35:44 2014 UTC,"I don't have a link handy, but I'll do my best to explain it. Basically it senses tension in the muscle, and acts as a negative feedback loop. It is made of collagen, and connects between the end of the muscle fiber and the tendon. It is innervated by a neuron called a type 1b neuron. When the muscle stretches due to force, the collagen fibers put pressure on the 1b neuron and cause it to fire. The rate of firing codes the amount of force detected. This signal goes to the brain, but it also loops back to the muscle, causing an inhibition signal. This inhibition signal keeps the motor neurons from firing, thus relaxing the muscle. The main purpose of this is to keep muscles from being injured by excessive force production. It is a fail safe. As force production increases in the muscle, so too does the inhibition signal from the GTO. However, this mechanism changes into a positive feedback loop during locomotion. This has to do with the swing phase of walking or running, and the fact that your entire body weight is supported on 1 leg.  Source: Bachelors in Physiology with focus on Neurophysiology"

AdvancedFitness,29r90r,phrakture,0,Thu Jul 3 21:29:00 2014 UTC,"The main purpose of this is to keep muscles from being injured by excessive force production.

AdvancedFitness,29r90r,troublesome,9,Thu Jul 3 19:34:23 2014 UTC,that's not the stretch reflex. stretch reflex is when a tendon is over-stretched and the intrafusal muscle fibers send a signal to the brain/spinal cord to contract the muscle hard. it's what plyometrics is based on.  autogenic inhibition shuts down the muscle. the stretch reflex contracts the muscle hard.
AdvancedFitness,29r90r,phrakture,7,Thu Jul 3 20:57:12 2014 UTC,Lemme try:  It makes it so you can't contract your muscle hard enough to injure your tendons.

AdvancedFitness,29r90r,phrakture,2,Thu Jul 3 19:44:08 2014 UTC,you can contract your muscle as hard as you want. it senses how much force a muscle is outputting and regulates it so you don't get hurt.

AdvancedFitness,29rnzl,phrakture,3,Thu Jul 3 22:02:57 2014 UTC,"I'm in a similar position, have tried out a few things over the past year. Currently off-season for rowing and finding that 60-90 mins steady state 70% HR rows rating 18 in the AM (x5, +2 in PM), followed by 3 PM oly lifting sessions per week is working.   Splits are getting lower with the rows, weights are getting higher in the gym. I have one rest day and one rest morning a week, so I put 2 of the oly lifting sessions before these longer periods of recovery.   My priority is definitely the rowing, so I don't mind the absolute numbers of my lifts taking a bit of a hit in the PM. With experimenting I found I initially could lift a lot more if I did oly in the AM (before destroying my legs with 18km of rowing) but progress was very slow. By shifting the lifting to PM after the row, I had to deload the bar initially, but am steadily improving with the better recovery.  So yeah, I don't know if my anecdotal story answers your q but basically I think you have a good strategy. Just play around with the timing to get the right mix for you. As I move into the racing season I will drop one of the lifting sessions and a PM steady state for two higher rating sessions."
AdvancedFitness,29rnzl,Datsun97,2,Fri Jul 4 01:45:47 2014 UTC,"It does help, I'm trying to decide how to order Oly and erging. As I see it I'm best served by being fresh for lifting in the morning and a little slow for the LISS in the afternoon; however, what I've read about mTor and AMPk seems to say that ordering it that way will stunt protein synthesis and potentially limit strength improvement. Since your program seems to be working, how many days of SS and how many days of Oly do you do? Also what sort of volume and intensity in your lifting sessions?"
AdvancedFitness,29rnzl,Datsun97,3,Fri Jul 4 03:01:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah thats what I initially thought too, and reading up on mTor and AMPk lead me to try out what I'm doing now. Although rowing/aerobic is priority it seems AMPk inhibits mTor but not the other way around, that's why I shifted lifting to be followed by recovery. Not being fresh definitely did require patience in the beginning, as I felt slow and empty. I was concerned I wouldn't be able to hit the right intensity with the lifting like this, but its working OK.  So total per week 3 lifting, 8 SS. One full rest day and one rest morning, the rest double days.    Lifting sessions generally take about 75 min including w/u and mobility. Starts with a technique couplet/triplet for whatever that day's lift is (biggest time chunk), dropping the technical movement when I move to a >80% 1.1 or 1.1.1. Then heavy pull or squat work (3-5 rep range), then a couple of higher rep shoulder accessory/core movements (8-12 rep range).  So my weekly program: Mon: Row, Lift. Tue: Row (90'), Run (40'). Wed: Row (90'), Lift. Thur: Off, Run (70'), Fri: Row (60'), Erg (60'). Sat: Row (90'), Lift. Sun: Sleeeeep. The Fri afternoon Erg is the first session to drop, and sometimes the runs become swims depending on how my knees feel."

Initially he said he didn't understand this advice, but with all the Crossfit seminars he's been giving, he's implemented more aerobic stuff lately.  If I recall correctly, he says that his numbers are lower, but the tradeoff is his ability to recover from training has greatly improved.

AdvancedFitness,29gpcb,RawMuscleLab,2,Wed Jul 2 07:05:18 2014 UTC,"Testosterone doesn't really change, but the shitty people some people get is due to prolactin and a temporary reduction in dopamine. You could say it ""feels"" like low testosterone. It's a question i get from a lot of people ""does ejaculation lower testosterone"". People tend to feel more relax, tired and less aggressive and amped after ejaculation. Some feel these effects more than others. I'm sure age, prolactin levels, neurotransmitters etc have something to do with that.  I almost forgot to add, orgasm can temporarily decrease androgen receptor density, so you might have the same level of testosterone but you might not feel the effects as much. These are your testosterone receptors in your brain.  Cumming won't affect your ""gains"" but the extra aggression and energy from abstinence could help you break PR's i guess.  Orgasm releases hormones and neurotransmitters like oxytocin, prolactin and other stuff that makes you more relaxed. Not ideal before a workout."
AdvancedFitness,29gpcb,RawMuscleLab,1 point,Wed Jul 2 14:12:41 2014 UTC,"Agree, orgasm releases a lot of powerful chemicals in the brain (oxytocin for one), and the abstinence from them for could make a notable difference...    What would be interesting is to have a long term study on 4 groups of athletes: regular athletes who ejaculate 1~3 times per week, athletes who ejaculates >3 times per week, athletes who stopped ejaculation for the short term (0~4 weeks), and athletes who stopped ejaculation for over an year.    Then measure their muscle growth, recovery, atp level, adrenal level, etc...  And at the end of the study we make all test subjects participate in Ninja Warrior.

Other details from the graphs I read.   Prolactin Levels - Same Heart Rate - Slightly Lower Both Blood Pressure Readings - Lower (Average of 9 mm Hg) Cortisol - Higher by around 0.7 ng/ml Noradrenaline - Lower by around 40 pg/ml   Now I think I remember that the testosterone spike even increase is pointless and the cortisol readings being higher are a negative?

Vitamin C helps make iron more easily absorbed, so any sources that also have high vitamin C are a good bet, and if you take a supplement, taking it with some fruit might improve the absorption.  So, I just realized I didn't really answer your question of managing it well (I eat lots of meat) or how challenging it is, but I'm going to post this to provide relevant information (all easily google'd, but meh, saves a some time for people)"

Even thought I eat quite well I find it hard to get all the iron I need from my diet unless I'm eating greens for all my meals. I can tell when my iron gets low because I start to feel sluggish despite getting plenty of sleep, and taking a multivitamin makes me feel more energized.

There is a lot on the internet about how iron can be maintained through diet alone but there is also info that vegetarians/vegans have lower iron stores (which I understand to be a kind of risk factor for anemia). My goal is to get a better sense of whether I can achieve this without taking a supplement.  Have you actually been diagnosed as having low iron w/ blood tests? I also wonder if popping a multi could really make your iron levels replenish so quickly? Or maybe I misunderstood what you wrote."

I'm already focused on trying to get enough protein for all my lifting and running, and also trying to reduce the amount of processed foods I eat, so to try and monitor Iron as well is just a bit overwhelming to do on a daily basis.  Again anecdotally, I think it can hit your system that quickly. I tried to give blood once before taking supplements and was turned away for low iron. A week later, I took a multivitamin the night before I went in and my iron was very good when I tried to donate blood (high on their chart). I realize that's kind of a dumb workaround to give blood, but I was dumb and in high school. But I didn't change anything else in my diet between the two times I went."

Is it logical that in both instances the first two groups can get from point a to point b quicker?  The reason I use this as an example is that when increasing strength you will see initial gains in an increased efficiency through the CNS. Better pathways equals more strength.  You might have heard of it when you hear someone say to 'visualize your lift' or 'focus'. It's the idea of preparing your body to send a signal to those muscles to tell them that they are about to need to contract.  I'd like to see them continue the study into more 'used' muscles to see if there is still even a slight difference. Perhaps take some people who aren't athletes but have been to a gym before.

As for infrared radiation, it has some therapeutic potential, cellular stimulation, improved blood flow, and some short-term relief from arthritic stiffness.  Perhaps there are more applications.  Basically, infrared radiation causes molecules to wiggle or vibrate, depending on the bonds and frequency (and infrared spectroscopy is the most poetic type of spectroscopy, imho)...its energy is absorbed by the molecules.

Which is why when you do an enormous amount of volume for a body part you might still be sore after 48 hours and not be able to hit it soon after. Even though you're done growing.   But this is most likely in context with split workouts because that's how most people workout   No it makes no difference if you're doing a full body or split. muscle protein synthesis is the same. But like I said before if you decide to ""blitzkrieg"" the muscle with stupid high volume it will feel like it takes longer to recover and this can interfere with recovery.    I know that ideally I should do two or three full bodies a week for bulking   What gives you that idea? Full bodies are not magic and splits can be just as effective.  That said, if you're doing very heavy fullbodies the drain on your cns may be greater than doing a split routine so you need to optimize intensity and volume."
AdvancedFitness,297rml,dirfarg,1 point,Fri Jun 27 04:58:31 2014 UTC,"You seem like you know things. So i have a question. The more muscle you have, the more you breakdown, the more you repair, the bigger you get quicker. Meaning exponential muscle growth? That cant be true?"
AdvancedFitness,297rml,dallen13,3,Fri Jun 27 14:41:31 2014 UTC,"The more muscle you have, the more you breakdown, the more you repair, the bigger you get quicker. Meaning exponential muscle growth? That cant be true?   It doesn't quite work like that. Instead of thinking about muscle gain as breaking it down and then recovering, just think of it as an elevation in muscle protein synthesis due to mechanical tension/fatigue/etc. When you work out assuming you have enough tension to drive adaptation, MPS is increased for some time. Depending on your nutrition and other factors, during this period a net amount of protein is accrued, meaning you built some muscle. As you gain more muscle it's harder to gain muscle, partly because of just restrictions in myofibrillar growth.  In general (as I'm sure you're aware) it's harder and harder to put on muscle as you gain more. Someone who's near their genetic max can take a few years to put on a few pounds whereas a skinny novice can probably do it in a few weeks."
AdvancedFitness,297rml,dirfarg,0,Fri Jun 27 16:57:11 2014 UTC,"I mean in regards to full bodies specifically, two or three a week is better for growth than one. Thank you for your help."
AdvancedFitness,297rml,dirfarg,2,Fri Jun 27 05:08:21 2014 UTC,I'm a little confused by your question. If you're specifically asking how long it takes to recover from a full body then you need to specify exactly what you mean by recover. And you need to give us an idea of how much volume you're doing. The fact that you're cutting is also a huge factor since it can interfere with recovery. I'm afraid more details would be needed.
AdvancedFitness,297rml,dirfarg,0,Fri Jun 27 05:17:13 2014 UTC,"Maybe I should have specified by asking how long hypertrophy would take place after a fully body workout. As for volume, I do two heavy sets for every muscle group except abs and chest (chest is too big, abs I want flat), first set I shoot for 8 reps until I almost fail, then second set 3-5 reps to near failure. Failure occasionally happens. It will be hard to go over exactly how much volume since I don't even know what half of my exercises are called..."
AdvancedFitness,297rml,dirfarg,1 point,Fri Jun 27 05:37:03 2014 UTC,it makes no difference if you're doing a full body or split. muscle protein synthesis is the same   As long as you stimulate muscle protein synthesis it will usually be around the same length. So around 48 hours. I'd take a look into MPS research if you want more information.
AdvancedFitness,297rml,broscientologist,1 point,Fri Jun 27 05:38:46 2014 UTC,"So should sources such as #2 in this be regarded as broscience? After some reading over the years I gathered that bigger muscles such as legs and back = more microtears = longer recovery (MPS) time. And thus working everything in a day = even longer MPS. So you're saying MPS is the same regardless of the amount of microtears? I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just needing confirmation before I start reading more into it."
AdvancedFitness,297rml,blitzl0l,2,Fri Jun 27 05:51:06 2014 UTC,"this is what I meant when I said people confuse the different definitions of recovery. When most people think of ""microtears"" and not being able to work bigger muscles again, this has nothing to do with muscle protein synthesis and everything to do with inflammation. It is true that if you do a crap load of volume for say delts and then legs your legs will probably be sorer and you'll have a harder time recovering than your delts. But the MPS is the still the same. The same goes for full bodies. Doing deadlifts and bench and all these big compounds may make you feel more drained (due to neural reasons) but the MPS is the same regardless. So to answer your question, the article you posted, if it's talking about MPS, is indeed wrong. I think Bryan Haycock (the creator of HST) writes a lot about this and his program is based around these principles.    So you're saying MPS is the same regardless of the amount of microtears?    It's not even completely clear that microtears are the reason for MPS elevation in the first place."

Although I haven't completely fixed the issue (similar to OP's), mine has improved. I had to do the most basic 'activation' exercises on transverse abdominal before doing anything like Pilates. At the start I had no idea how to activate it and it was frustrating. If I had gone straight into Pilates I wouldn't be using much 'true core' and would probably have reinforced the issues"

AdvancedFitness,28zvq2,kalistickz,2,Wed Jun 25 00:43:22 2014 UTC,I've had the same issue for sometime now. For like 6 years my left groin has been irreparably tight and has just gotten progressively worse no matter what I did and I'm pretty sure its one of the main causes of my many injuries.  Recently I've been seeing an osteopath who actually knows what he's doing and is helping me make progress. I play hockey and shoot off my left hip leading to a huge imbalance and a fucked up pubic symphasis/SI joint. My left hip is anteriorly tilted and super tight while my right is much more mobile.   What I've concluded so far(I'm eventually going to get an MRI) is that my pubic symphasis is off and it has made my core weak and kind of twisted causing pain and bad compensatory movement patterns. It could also be a sports hernia or disc damage (hence MRI). I agree with the person who suggested pelvic floor work and deep core stuff. Look into proper breathing technique and reevaluate your posture.  This is just my experience that I thought I'd share. I'm trying to figure it out until I can afford an MRI because its ruining my athletic progress and has forced me to stop competing.

AdvancedFitness,2905uo,crovax33,6,Tue Jun 24 21:59:57 2014 UTC,"I love hearing advice on massage from people who aren't massage therapists! Lot's of horrible advice here.    What I would recommend as a massage instructor is to look into a structural bodyworker- a Rolfer or structural integrator. They can effectively assess your faulty movement patterns, work the muscle with the knot, and then treat any other lines of pull and patterns associated with the knot. It might be that all the treatments you've had are being effective, to some extent, but the postural or movement pattern you have is causing the muscle to just bind back up again. It might be that you have a dropped arch in your foot, which then causes your knee to rotate inward, which makes your pelvis tilt, which causes your spine to curve outside of the normal curvatures, which put pressure on the spot you've developed the knot in. Just an example. That fact that you've tried so many avenues without success just screams that the primary problem is not being addressed, so the secondary problem isn't progressing."
AdvancedFitness,2905uo,LMTJB,4,Wed Jun 25 20:17:52 2014 UTC,"not really the same thing but i got excellent results for a tendon issue from an ART massage therapist. he happened to be an excellent therapist who worked on a lot of professional athletes, but he fixed what my orthopedist didn't in six sessions. of course insurance covered the orthopedist but not the massage therapist."
AdvancedFitness,2905uo,FloatingFast,3,Wed Jun 25 01:41:28 2014 UTC,"It might be worth looking into ART (active release technique.) I worked under a chiro who pretty much only did ART, and a lot of people had good results. It's a technique that involves the therapist putting pressure on a muscle then passively moving (i.e. they move it, you don't contract it) a joint through part of it's range of motion. The idea is to loosen the fascia from muscle tissue. As you can imagine it's almost 'ripping' it apart, so it's a little painful but no real damage is done.   Be prepared for $60-$100 per session. PT's, chiros, and others can be ART certified, so depending on who you see it might be covered by your insurance. Worth trying even if it's not."
AdvancedFitness,2905uo,willowedd,3,Wed Jun 25 04:30:49 2014 UTC,"You could try warming the tissue up with moderate foam rolling for 3-5 minutes and then do some trigger point release therapy on it with the lacrosse ball. I'm not sure if you've been doing this or not, but basically you let the ball sink into the knot area and apply consistent pressure without rolling and let the tension release. May take many times over a long period, but it might help."
AdvancedFitness,2905uo,Ewitsallsticky,4,Wed Jun 25 02:21:20 2014 UTC,"A good, general rule for chronic issues like this is that: However long it's been happening, expect it to take just as long to reverse it. Now, this isn't necessarily true, but try to understand the point.   If something bugs someone for 1 week, it probably won't take terribly long to fix the muscular issue. If you've had this problem for 10 years, it will take a long time to fix the problem.  Have you tried acupuncture or cupping to supplement the massage? I would also see a chiropractor who knows what they're doing and is science based (X-rays, knows proper degree of vertebrae, spinal scanner, and won't adjust you just because they think they know best). Especially since it's only on one side, you may have some cervical disc issues that are throwing your back out! Cervical spine is everything.

I have only gone to the guy whose page I linked - Edan Harari in NYC.  Essentially, what they do for tough knots is figure out what the hell the body is trying to protect with that hardened mass of tissue, have you twist or move into a shape in which the stress on the knot is eased, and then try to pop it out with one swift movement. If it works, it's almost instantaneous, though semi-temporary. This worked for me for some posture-based knots that I've had for years and years on the back of my hip (don't ask...) - the knot would go away for a day or so, and then would slowly start coming back because my posture was still fucked. However, it sounds like your posture is currently better, so it might be more useful for you. Good luck..."

AdvancedFitness,2905uo,In7meanFlavors,2,Wed Jun 25 17:39:16 2014 UTC,"Hey man I also am struggling with poor movement of my scapula and a trigger point in my rhomboids (which is probably where yours is based on your description).  What I have learned is that it's not necessarily a strength or trigger point issue, but a coordination issue. Lots of people never fully develop good scapular mobility and because of that they never develop correct motor patterns. Because of that you see a lot of people end up hurting their shoulders because poor scapular mobility causes the shoulder to not function properly and the various tissues and muscles attaching to the scapula can begin to develop dysfunctions like trigger points, tendinopathies, etc.  So it could be that your scapula isn't moving properly due to lack of coordination and it's causing the ""knot"" or trigger point to not go away or be more noticeable. I don't think it's the trigger point that is completely limiting your movement like you said because you probably have trigger points in many muscles in your body, but the joints they attach to still function properly. It's most likely due to the faulty movement patterns associated with the muscles attaching to your scapula that you have developed over your lifetime that are the most important factor to address.  My PT had me doing all sorts of retraction exercises, push-up plus, etc. it wasn't helping and then I found these videos: http://youtu.be/81x0NlZe0es http://youtu.be/R9mHV0of5I0  I started out doing the scapular coordination exercises he mentions in the first video and I'm trying to work up to the scapular pull ups. I already notice a giant difference in how my scapula moves on my injured shoulder. It no longer feels ""stuck"" like it used to and I can now consciously control it a lot better. The trigger point in my rhomboids is also slowly getting better but it's still there.  So just to summarize if I was you I would continue treating yourself with the lacrosse ball or whatever and getting the dry needling done, and start doing those exercises to try and get the best control of your scapula that you can. Honestly, how I'm approaching it right now is I'm trying to be able to be able to consciously control both my scapulas like I can any other limb or body part. I think we forget that the scapula is supposed to move like any other limb/body part because it's so easy to neglect and breaking ourselves of the faulty movement patterns we have developed takes a lot of time. My goal is to break those faulty patterns and gain full coordination and hopefully that will fix the root cause of my problem.   Anyway, I hope that helps and sorry for the wall of text haha."

I just wrote down what came to mind on the subject, and what I felt was relevant to your question.   When glucose concentration in the blood is low, the production of a series of hormones is stimulated, most importantly glucagon, adrenalin, cortisol and GH. Glucagon increases the production og glucose through gluconeogenesis, as well as ketone body production from triglycerides in the liver. Since a lot of the glucose in such an environment is created from protein, the ketones leads to a lowered degree of protein breakdown.   If amino acids, which is the final 'stage' of protein breakdown is abundant, the rest will be deaminated in the form of ammoniac (?), which is toxic to the organism. Ammoniac is converted in the liver to urea, which is transported to the kidneys where it is released. Some of the abundant amino acids can also be broken down into uric acid, which can contribute to arthritis.  TL;DR: protein is broken down into smaller parts, amino acids. If there are more amino acids than the body can utilize, it will convert them to urea, uric acid, fat or glucose, depending on the protein type and state of current dietary deposits.  I hope this helps."

I am under the impression that rabbit starvation has nothing at all to do with excess protein (healthy kidneys can handle very high protein loads) and more to do with the fact that the body isn't getting enough EFAs from the lean rabbit meat.
AdvancedFitness,28y4y4,Boobem,2,Fri Jun 27 14:32:11 2014 UTC,"I think you're overthinking this.  You are in a net calorie deficit regardless so you aren't going to gain weight if you consume more protein than is recommended (to a reasonable limit, ofc). But protein is still calories so consuming extra will give you a smaller deficit and therefore slow down weight loss.  A psmf is just a super low calorie diet optimized for losing weight as quickly as possible while minimizing lean mass loss."

AdvancedFitness,28y4y4,phrakture,5,Fri Jun 27 04:26:45 2014 UTC,"You never poop out nutrients. If you're interested in nutrition at all it's important to know that basically everything digestible gets absorbed before it even reaches the large intestine. Some things that you can't store or are toxic passes in urine, but digestible protein, fats and carbs are either stored or broken down and only ever leaves your body as CO2 (which you breathe out) and water.   The extra amino acids would be broken down and feed into the cycles that make glucose and fat, so it would slow down weight loss."

AdvancedFitness,28y4y4,Boobem,3,Tue Jun 24 12:20:00 2014 UTC,About 3/4 water. Bacteria makes up 1/3 or more of the dry weight and most of the rest is fibre.

AdvancedFitness,28vpb6,Insamity,1 point,Mon Jun 23 15:57:26 2014 UTC,"I think the surplus is really the only factor. I haven't seen any evidence of negative aspects of fructose aside from gout.   In this study, a high-sucrose intake as part of an eucaloric, weight-maintaining diet had no detrimental effect on insulin sensitivity, glycemic profiles, or measures of vascular compliance in healthy nondiabetic subjects.   http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/55/12/3566.long   It has been considered that moderate fructose consumption of ≤50g/day or ~10% of energy has no deleterious effect on lipid and glucose control and of ≤100g/day does not influence body weight. No fully relevant data account for a direct link between moderate dietary fructose intake and health risk markers.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21050460   The change in body fatness that occurs with modifying intakes seems to be mediated via changes in energy intakes, since isoenergetic exchange of sugars with other carbohydrates was not associated with weight change.   http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e7492   From the studies reviewed, it would appear that a moderate dietary sucrose intake at levels up to 25% of energy appears to have no significant adverse effects on lipid or carbohydrate metabolism in normal healthy adults when substituted for starch, at least in the medium term (several weeks).   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630450/"

Ongoing for years, but it started getting worse when I started lifting and started commuting by bike. First I fixed my should mobility which helped but didn't resolve the pain. Then I discovered all the self myofascial release and made sweet sweet love to a series of balls. This would temporarily make it feel good but like you, the pain would quickly return. Finally, I was watching some of the mobility WOD videos and during one he was talking about the first rib. He mentioned that people who carry heavy packs frequently ( like me) often have pain that radiates to the trap/neck area. Lo and behold working on mobilizing my first rib fixed me.     So yes, I think you are treating the symptoms without identifying the problem. It terms of figuring out what to do depends on your disposition I think. I generally can eventually identify a lot of my problems through trial and error and a lot of research and fix them via strengthening and mobility."

Then I sling it over my neck so there is one strap on my neck and the weight is in front of me(sorry that wasn't a great description but mess around with it and you can figure out the best way for you). Now for the best part. Take a lacrosseball(or try a tennis ball cause it hurts like a mother) and place it under the backpack strap so the weight is pulling the ball into your first rib. Then hang on a ledge with the same side hand as the ball is on and trying last for about 30 seconds. I've honestly never felt such a large change from one exercise before.

AdvancedFitness,28nctc,goatchop41,0,Sat Jun 21 01:31:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah I know. That doesn't mean proper medical technique isn't important.

There is no extra long term benefit from actually injecting a substance, and it causes more pain during the procedure.  Also consider the fact that with an otherwise healthy patient, the chance of infection is incredibly low. Sterile, single use needles are used and the standard diameter is 0.3mm (compare this to the ~0.8-0.9mm diameter of a 21 gauge needle used for injections). There is no significant increase in the chance of infection simply because a doctor is not performing the procedure.  Regarding your dosage/treatment regimen - some MTrPs can be abolished with one session of needling, some need more. But just because that same spot is having a very small needle introduced to it again in a week, again this does not mean that infection risk is significantly increased - a 0.3mm entry site would have closed over by that time!"
AdvancedFitness,28nctc,goatchop41,1 point,Sat Jun 21 02:38:15 2014 UTC,Dry needling and acupuncture aren't the same thing either   That's why I suggested needling vs acupuncture.   I think we may be arguing past each other. I understand the efficacy of dry needling and I also know that some doctors don't know yet that you don't need lidocaine in the needle. But many do and will prescribe dry needling for trigger points. I used trigger point injections as a catch all for both injections and dry needling and I know how unlikely it is to get an infection. The main thing I am trying to get across is to avoid pseudoscience (even though acupuncture is one of the few ancient treatments that has been shown effective) in favor of evidence based medicine when you can.

I learnt how to dry needle from a Physio who was accredited in both DN and Acupuncture. What was very interesting was when he showed us a comparison of traditional acupuncture points vs where MTrPs commonly present themselves - there is A LOT of overlap between the two!

Both have 0 calories, it would be interesting to see if the LCS's had any effects on wieght that water doesn't."

AdvancedFitness,28ioj9,andnuclearwar,10,Thu Jun 19 02:50:30 2014 UTC,"I'm a lock for my rugby club, and I've been in your shoes. Here are a few things that have helped me.   At the beginning of the winter/spring season, we were put on a workout program that called for 4x8 of the big four (squat/deadlift/OHP/bench) with 90 second rest periods. This necessitated dropping weight significantly in order to accomplish, but I found my cardiovascular health, on-field endurance, and yes, my lifts all increase past a few plateaus I had found myself on. Starting Strength is an excellent program to make beginning strength gains, but you needn't stay there for long. Fair warning, though: after every visit to the gym, you will feel like you just played a full 80 minutes. It is exhausting. For speed, you want to look for workouts designed to increase your quickness in short bursts. Think acceleration instead of raw speed. Box jumps, Olympic lifting, and a variety of field drills can all help with this. It's tempting to look just at the squat as the best workout for your position as prop. But remember that how quickly you can recruit that strength in a scrum or lifting in a lineout is as important. As a second row, the best props I've ever pushed with are quick out of their stance on the ""set"" call, which gives me a tiny bit more distance forward to get in a more advantageous position to push. Explosiveness out of the stance is very important. Practicing that motion itself will help you, as will practicing against a scrum sled, playing more, squat jumps, etc. Propping is a very technical position, and takes years of experience and practice to learn the proper techniques. Weaker props beat stronger props all the time with technique and experience. Keep practicing and learning. Eat a lot and sleep a lot. That is the best way to recover from working out so hard."
AdvancedFitness,28ioj9,kimchibear,1 point,Thu Jun 19 04:59:34 2014 UTC,"What was the frequency like on the big four 4x8? I can squat 3x a week, but I imagine I'd be wrecked doing that routine more than twice a week without a split somewhere."
AdvancedFitness,28ioj9,andnuclearwar,1 point,Fri Jun 20 05:11:07 2014 UTC,"It was actually once a week. Mind you, this was an in-season program, so our schedule looked like this:  Monday -- Front Squat, Deadlift, OHP, Bench Press, Lat Pulldowns (4x8)  Tuesday -- Practice (usually contact drills, scrimmage)  Wednesday -- Practice (skills work and running), Power Day (Cleans, Squat Press, a few other power movements, Abs)  Thursday -- Practice (less running, more game plan)  Friday -- Bodyweight (Pullups, pushups, dips, light jog)  Saturday -- Game  Sunday -- Active Recovery, Swimming, Stretching, etc.  Off-season, we're on our own. I'm doing something a little different now based on a few other goals I've had, but I'm switching back to this program in about a month to get ready for the fall season. I definitely couldn't do Monday three times a week."

AdvancedFitness,28ioj9,ak_doug,1 point,Thu Jun 19 13:18:16 2014 UTC,"This. If you switch to a weekly split like Westside it makes planning your recover easier, and you can work on the day's muscle group harder. Doing heavy squats followed up by hill work is the toughest part of Alex Viada's plan, but it makes the overall recovery so much easier. I have been making significant gains in endurance, strength, and losing weight all at the same time. There is no reason that you couldn't too. We even lift about the same amount, and I'm 6'1"" 260 right now, so our body makeup is about the same, and I run a bit faster. All really close though."
AdvancedFitness,28ioj9,RawMuscleLab,3,Thu Jun 19 17:36:31 2014 UTC,"Is there any real reason you need to be as heavy as you are?  I was 260lbs at 5ft 10"" and it used to kill me, maybe you can handle it, but I couldn't (I can't stand weighing over 190lbs).  Losing some weight will see you increase your endurance and will probably increase your squat (at the moment, I'm assuming the extra weight is putting you at a disadvantage).  Maybe you can handle it also, but you could get some problems jogging uphill and downill with the sprints, you might be fine, but it might be tough on your feet, so always look out if your feet are becoming tender and whatnot.  That's all I could think of right now, it's late!"
AdvancedFitness,28ioj9,yourefunny,6,Thu Jun 19 04:38:57 2014 UTC,I was around 190 and then I gained ~50 lb due to psychiatric medication. I'm working on losing it.
AdvancedFitness,28ioj9,astrower,3,Thu Jun 19 04:40:50 2014 UTC,"Hey buddy, fellow prop here. Have been playing rugby since I was 8 and am 25 now. I have played at a reasonable standard in the UK and now in Hong Kong. Now I am no expert on the matter, I am just going off what I am doing and have done to build strength, power and fitness as well as lose a bit of excess weight!  Due to some injuries I personally hate long distance running and it isn't really necessary for rugby, especially front row! I weigh about what you do at 6"". Last year I cut down my weight to around 220 and boy did it help me with getting around the park and I was able to do 5 or so pull ups for 4 sets which was unheard for me in my life until then. I atribute that loss of 20 odd lbs to my diet and consistency in exercising! I was hitting the gym and do strongman workouts like 4-5 times a week. The problem was that it hurt my scrummaging because my weight was down! Now, as you have only been playing two years the weight in the scrum won't be as important as getting your technique and strength up. If you want to be able to do pull ups then go for it but it isn't overly important for rugby, especially props. I found that losing the weight helped faaaar more than any amount of assisted pull ups. Even though I have put the weight on that I lost I can still do a fair amount of pull ups and it is great.  As for training it all depends at what stage you are in the off season. I'm guessing you live in the US. I'm not 100% on when your season starts but for me at the moment it restarts in September. Therefore I am on a hypotrophy and aerobic program. You should do the same if your season starts around then! I suggest therefore changing from a purely strength rep range to hypotrophy rep range, think about 8 reps on a 4 set program.  I would add a few lifts if you can have someone help you get the technique right. For props our posterior chain and core are of high importance as are our necks! Deadlift and Squat will help there as long as your technique is spot on. I had shit technique when I was younger and buggered my back which has plagued me since!! Don't do that! The lifts I'd add if you can are the clean and front squat. Those are great for rugby and the clean is especially great for improving power. Try and move the bar as fast as you can.   As for improving your fitness around the park I suggest doing some 'sprints'. I know this isn't strictly aerobic but when playing rugby you have rests, you aren't constantly running. For example last week with my team we did 3 sets of 4 reps of 300 metre sprints. This will be very hard to do by yourself as keeping motivated on the 8-12th sprint is ruddy hard. I threw up. Therefore I suggest you bring the numbers down a bit. Either the distance or rep count. I'm off to do more of this in a few hours and after a stag do (bachelor weekend) this past weekend I am dreading it!!   What is most important is consistency! Diet is key and will certainly help get your strength and power up as well as lose some excess fat. If you can stomach it, try cutting out basic carbs like potatoes, rice, noodles, pasta etc. Eat plenty of meat, steak, chicken, pork and fish with veggies!! That is the way to pile on the muscle! Get some protein powder if you want. I don't use it but plenty of people in better and worse shape than me do! I'd go 1 gram of protein for every lbs you weight but in general just try and get as much protein laden food in your diet. So eggs for breako, chicken salad or sandwich for lunch and some meat, veg and sweet potato for dinner! Sweet potato saved me when I changed my diet up! Got any more Qs feel free to PM! Peace."
AdvancedFitness,28ioj9,astrower,3,Thu Jun 19 06:20:24 2014 UTC,"You need to periodize your training. You shouldn't try to get better at both at the same time. I'm a triathlete that loves to lift. I focus on building strength and maintaining endurance when I don't have a race for a while, then switch to improving my lactate threshold as the race approaches.  A lot of people here are giving you actual work outs or saying lose weight. I agree with both, but you'll get far more out of just training properly. Pick something to work on for a month, say your squat or your 5 mile time, and only focus on improving that while maintaining the other stats. If the other stuff goes up great, if not that's ok too, we just don't want it to go down.  Athletes always train in mesocycles and macrocycles. It's stupid to do it otherwise, you'll just burn out like you're seeing now."

AdvancedFitness,2883ke,ephrion,4,Mon Jun 16 03:59:36 2014 UTC,"honestly, I think even lifting heavy and making gains/bodybuilding doesn't really have a positive impact on your life (length or quality). It's weird because the sweet spot of the ""ideal"" amount of fitness (to decrease mortality, add years onto your life, etc) is way less than the amount done by people who are ""into fitness"". But it's way more than the amount done by people who are sedentary. Then the public health campaigns transmit the message to ""be active"", and then people who are already into fitness take it to mean that they should get deeper into whatever fitness they are doing, and then end up getting more intensely into it than necessary for health effects. I mean its not a bad thing, but the point is that they aren't doing it for their own health anymore."
AdvancedFitness,2883ke,ephrion,5,Mon Jun 16 04:08:22 2014 UTC,"honestly, I think even lifting heavy and making gains/bodybuilding doesn't really have a positive impact on your life (length or quality).   I really disagree with that. There is the initial benefit to cardiovascular fitness that helps prevent heart disease which can be accomplished with very little exercise, and additional strength/fitness doesn't add to. But it seems to me that achieving a 2xBW squat or having a lot of extra muscle when I can manage it is going to make my muscles, connective tissue, and bones very strong. As I age and my body naturally starts deteriorating, I'll have a much stronger body which should last a lot longer than one that is weaker and more frail to begin with.   It's also been demonstrated that grip strength correlates well with longevity independent of familial factors, and grip strength was used as a proxy for overall muscle strength. Increased bone density will ward off osteoperosis, and increased strength will delay or prevent the onset of frailty."
AdvancedFitness,2883ke,Duffy_,2,Mon Jun 16 13:07:30 2014 UTC,"I agree that 2xBW squat will make you very strong and give you strong muscles, CT, and bones, but it's overkill. A 150lb guy who works up to a 150lb squat will have strong muscles, CT, and bones. If they have muscle, CT, or bone frailty problems in later life, it's not something that working up to a 2xBW 300lb squat in younger life would have prevented. Increased bone density will ward off osteoporosis, but after a certain amount of bone density, you can't ward off osteoporosis any more than it's already been warded off, and then you're just pushing your squats so you can be aesthetic and strong (and not for bone health in later life).  I read the article that you linked, and in the study they recruited men born before 1906 in Hawaii and I think it's unlikely that any of them were on weightlifting bodybuilding routines that get them up to 2x BW squats (because that kind of thing was not popular then). Also on the second page on the left column, the authors acknowledge that grip strength and longevity are probably indirectly linked (genetically); the article is not saying that ""because subjects had more muscle strength, they lived longer"". Also, I didn't see any mention of grip strength as a symptom of weight training in their younger years anywhere in the article. My guess is that people in the study that had more grip strength either just genetically had more muscle tone throughout the aging process, or maybe they had more physically demanding lives where bodyweight stuff was worked in (versus people with sedentary office lives), but the results were not due to heavy lifting in their younger years.  I'm really interested in this topic though, if you have more articles I'd be really interested to read."
AdvancedFitness,2883ke,Duffy_,2,Mon Jun 16 17:57:10 2014 UTC,"From the conclusion of the second link:    Hence, we conclude that a middle adulthood handgrip measurement, which is representative of general muscle strength, is not a marker of exceptional familiar longevity.   So it might not be just a genetic thing.  ""How much is effective?"" is a question that, IIRC, there is no research on. From this, it states that there's a 1% muscle mass loss per year, which suggests that each bit you get while young will allow for longer and longer life. In this way, bone/CT/muscle mass acts like a 'retirement account' of sorts."

Or, are you just referencing the extreme side of lifting where you have hardcore powerlifting/bodybuilding elite which rely on having high amounts of mass & drugs which causes a lot of strain on the body?"
AdvancedFitness,2883ke,porker912,4,Mon Jun 16 05:26:43 2014 UTC,"No offense intended. I mean that the body split program bodybuilders that go 5 days a week on different body parts. That type of weightlifting routine doesn't have a positive impact on mortality or extending your length of life. While weightlifters might shoot for squatting 2x bodyweight, you don't need to go anywhere near that heavy to prevent osteoporosis in later life. Higher reps and lower weights is enough for health benefits in later life, but bodybuilding and strength routines emphasize heavier and heavier weights and lower reps because they aim for maximal strength and hypertrophy.   Another important thing is that a lot of them cut out cardio from their routine, which is something that does have a positive impact in your life (VO2 max, etc.).  Don't get me wrong, weightlifting is fun. Exercise in general gets people out of depressive moods. But I think its important for people to know that we are doing it because we want to be stronger and look more aesthetic, and the degree that we are pursuing it even as a hobbyist, is much further than what is necessary for better health both now and in later life."
AdvancedFitness,2883ke,Duffy_,2,Mon Jun 16 05:42:01 2014 UTC,"I totally agree with your viewpoint. I personally believe the #1 way to improve your long term quality of life is to be mobile and without the need for assistance as long as possible. In that context I do believe everybody, especially as they age, should get accustomed to bodyweight squats but loading up a barbell is just unnecessary. Removing cardio from an exercise regimen is also probably not the best idea, either."

With that said I've always been confused about these kinds of findings, because my experience doesn't reflect them whatsoever. At the worst I am weak, tired, dehydrated for a day or so, and some days I will be a bit hungover and hit PRs.  It makes sense to cut alcohol wayyy back if you are a paid/elite athlete, because it could definitely affect consistency in performance, but as far as your average joe, like most of us on here, is it really hindering our gains that much?"

As long as you eat some greens to maintain a good micronutrient intake, it's pretty much bacon, eggs, and cheese all day. /r/keto even has occasional posts of people who reversed their type II diabetes. People are literally eating 80-100+ grams of saturated fats a day and they make posts about their low triglyceride and cholesterol count.  The study you mentioned and the OP study did nothing to control diet, especially not in regard to carbohydrate intake. The OP study just stuffed the subjects with muffins made with either of the oils.

AdvancedFitness,27xe6f,peaknuckle,6,Thu Jun 12 04:53:33 2014 UTC,"Because the ketogenic diet is actually a healthy option.   i wouldn't call that the REASON. the reason is because a meta-analysis of over 60 articles found that eating higher amounts of saturated fats did NOT have an effect on heart disease in humans, as previously thought. the only fat that does seem to have an impact is trans-saturaded fats, which you can get from fried foods, fast foods, junk food, and baked goods.   furthermore it's not like you can eat all the fat you want indiscriminately -- there aren't many longitudinal studies that look into whether or not that's good for you, the only thing we DO know is it doesn't have much of an effect on heart disease. so, technically, basing an entire diet around fat (saturated, unsaturated, polyunsaturated, whatever) is not the BEST of ideas. neither is basing your entire diet around carbs or protein. once again, moderation and a varied diet is the best policy.  ketogenic diets, when they are well balanced, are perfectly fine and have all the effects you're describing -- all i'm saying is that is a byproduct of the fact that eating saturated fats isn't AS bad for you as previously thought, and a bunch of other research (on diabetes and carbs, for example) rather than the actual reason ""people are giving saturated fats a free pass""."

Either way, the saturated fat in palm oil is 44% palmitic acid. 44% palmitic acid is the unique negative property you were looking for (it just happens to be related to its specific saturated fat content). I have a hard time believing that the study's results would be so the same if they had used coconut oil or soybean oil, both very low in palmitic acid. The World Health Organization puts palm oil on par with trans fats as far as health effects are concerned.   Edit: The study you mentioned used butter for SFA, which is 29% palmitic acid."
AdvancedFitness,27xe6f,peaknuckle,3,Thu Jun 12 05:45:17 2014 UTC,"OK, so let's take this another step. If palmitic acid is indeed as bad as trans fats, then, for optimal health, a person should try to limit their consumption of palmitic acid, yes? And since the SFAs in butter are 29% palmitic acid, and the SFAs in beef are about 26% palmitic acid, then the ketogenic diet is not optimal for health, since that diet naturally includes large amounts of palmitic acid."

AdvancedFitness,27xe6f,Breal3030,2,Thu Jun 12 14:17:44 2014 UTC,"Oh I agree that more research needs to be done, but think of it this way. When the SFAs are consumed with junk carbs, the body suffers. But when SFAs are not consumed with junk carbs, the body simply maintains. That is, there is nothing positive about consuming SFAs versus well-known healthy fats such as MUFAs and whole-food fats (avocados, nuts, seeds). At least, I have not seen a well-designed study showing beneficial results from SFA intake. We can go more info what would involve a good SFA study too, if I really need to your all that out on my phone. :)  So if you have the option of a diet high in SFAs, or a diet high in MUFAs and whole-food fats, the better choice seems apparent, at least from a health perspective. Regarding fat consumption, it would appear that a whole-foods plant-based diet is superior to a ketogenic diet."

It's not enough that the fiber they get be like dust, it has to be somewhat intact in its length.  Now, obviously humans are not rabbits, but it seems as though if that parameter matters for them it might matter in a smaller amount for us, and fresh vegetables in our natural diet will have some fiber in them that's intact.

First, our weight room had about 25 Olympic platforms/racks with bumpers and iron plates. We also had a lot of dumbbells and auxiliary equipment. I would say the weight room could accommodate about 80 football players if they didn't need to be supervised.   Second, the coaches split us up into different lifting groups (two I think) of about 55 guys.  After that we would be split into groups of 4-5 based on strength and assigned to racks. At the racks, we would do the main lifts for the day - bench, squat, clean, deadlift etc. and variations thereof.   Third, there would be two blocks of auxiliary work. So maybe rack 1-5 would do block 1 first and 6-10 would do block 2 before switching.   Finally, we would do 'dessert' as a team which was basically stupid hazing. Like, you have to do 10 perfect push-ups as a team but someone didn't get full depth so we do it again, or sometimes the coaches would make people fall on purpose. Fun times!  We would usually be on our own for stretching and rolling out afterwards.   Oh also, we had two warmup groups pre-lift."
AdvancedFitness,27wi3q,bigbrun12,8,Wed Jun 11 22:05:27 2014 UTC,I worked as an intern and later as an assistant strength coach at a D1 school. In my experience the biggest logistics issues were not dealing with space or equipment but an unmanageable athlete to coach ratio. It is extremely difficult for even an experienced coach to provide optimal training to a dozen or more athletes at once doing complex exercises. This taught me a few big things that I still apply when training teams.   I refuse more than a 12:1 coach to athlete ratio. Often times that means I have to hire an assistant and take less money for myself but it's worth it because it's the only way I feel comfortable and like I am providing a quality training experience Minimize the number of coaching intensive exercises. I do far more unilateral work in groups because it's just hard to get a lot of people squatting and deadlifting well all at once. I can show a step up or lunge pattern once and have all the guys doing it with good weight within 2 minutes Less Olympic lifts and more jumps. For the same reasons as listed in #2.   A lot of that is just my opinion and personal experience and by no means is it the law but I hope that gives you some insight.

Each coach is going to have a different set of circumstances (coach:player ratio, space, equipment, etc) so they'll all find their own way of handling it."

At the same time, 510-515, group b shows up and starts foam rolling, stretching, and warming up.  At about 530, group a is doing strength exercises, group b is doing plyometrics and o-lifts and group c is warming up.  There's just a continuous cycle where people move from one ""station"" to the next.  The downside is you need a good floor plan so everything can move along smoothly.  It's easier with athletes because they're used to being told what to do and where to go."

Carrying excess muscle would be counter to that goal as the more muscle you have the greater the demand upon your heart, no matter how slight add up over the course if a lifetime.   Also consider that continually stressing your body lifting heavy weights is forcing your body to continually repair itself, increasing the rate of cell division and therefore increasing the likelihood of mutation occurring (cancer).   If you want to absolutely maximise your lifespan, it's not good to carry any more muscle around than you actually need or to stress your body as harshly as heavy weightlifting requires.   On the other hand, I'm sure most people would rather have their dream muscly physique than live a couple years longer."
AdvancedFitness,27u9q5,HattoriHanzo88,1 point,Sun Jun 22 11:42:59 2014 UTC,"I think you're missing the fact that the longevity benefit depends on BOTH the fasting and the re-feeding.  Fasting causes the elimination of a significant portion of your blood cells; we believe the bulk of the re-absorbed cells are the weaker/older ones. At the same time, fasting primes your stem cells to be ready to create new blood cells. The conditions of fasting put your stem cells into a ""super-ready to build"" mode.  Then, when you start eating again, the ""primed"" stem cells produce fresh, new blood cells to replace the ones you lost. This regeneration only begins after you start eating again. Your body doesn't normally produce extra blood cells if it thinks you have a proper supply; otherwise, you'd have too many. It only produces them to replace ones that die off. The fasting forces a die-off, of sorts.  So both parts of the cycle are important - the fasting is ""out with the old,"" and re-feeding is ""in with the new.""  Do this enough times in a row, and it's like replacing your system with a new one!  The body does not normally work so hard to get rid of the old - some of the reclaiming/scavenging process don't get triggered until you run out of food for an extend period of time. In the western world, we're not forced into that situation, so we have to make a choice to fast.  There's good reason this same effect happens in other bodily cell systems and organs, but this study was looking specifically at blood cells. Blood cells are great for this experiment, because it's easy to draw blood samples, and it's easy to count how many different types of cells are floating around in your blood plasma - in effect, we can easily measure ""shrinkage"" in the number of cells in your blood. It's really hard to accurately measure the degree of cell loss/gain in other body systems."

AdvancedFitness,27skuy,mglsts,7,Tue Jun 10 15:54:01 2014 UTC,"If we're going to be sticklers, you're ignoring the very thing this paper set out to investigate and asking something else entirely.    If we're not, then it's a definite maybe and hinges on the things that come with the added milk and how they influence your perception of '>'."
AdvancedFitness,27skuy,eric_twinge,9,Tue Jun 10 16:12:20 2014 UTC,"I know I ignored certain things, but I'm trying to extrapolate these results into a real world practical and simplified experience (instead of a super controlled lab environment), and that's why I asked the question the way I did.   Isn't that the purpose of posting these studies? To help us maximize the results of our real life training and nutrition?  I hear all around that whey with just water is superior to adding milk, because adding milk slows down absorption and it's usually attributed to the added casein and fat (in cases it applies like half/full fat milk) content.  This seems to hint that whey and casein (and soy but that's harder to come by, and I still have my doubts because of the Trypsin content of certain soy products) blend might wield superior results.  Of course there are other things in milk that may or may not make a difference (sugar, hormones, chemicals and fat), but assuming the user already drinks milk regularly, then according to this study would it be safe to assume that such a mix might prove to be slightly superior. This due to milk providing a similar sustained release as the sodium caseinate blend.  So the question was, would that be relatively safe to assume, or am I missing some nuances?  I apologize if the question came out overtly simplistic and/or in a crude way."

Would speed of absorption really be that important with protein synthesis being elevated for a prolonged period of time?

AdvancedFitness,27skuy,tigerdb2,1 point,Tue Jun 10 18:04:18 2014 UTC,"Well if you didn't consume protein just before a work out (assuming the workout is let's say ~2 hours for the sake of argument), aren't you in a catabolic state post workout until protein is consumed? If that is true then speed of absorption would benefit maximizing time spent in an anabolic state and minimizing time spent in a catabolic state."
AdvancedFitness,27skuy,heavilyarmedclown,1 point,Tue Jun 10 22:30:44 2014 UTC,You are correct. Unless you have fasted it's not so important when you get your protein as it is how much you are consuming in a given day.

AdvancedFitness,27skuy,Breal3030,1 point,Tue Jun 10 19:12:19 2014 UTC,"For the most part it isn't, but that is still one of the major selling points of whey protein. Fast absorption protein for when you need it. Even though most of the protein timing and anabolic window myths have been debunked, it's still one of the major reasons it's preferred and pushed over other types of protein.  This study seems to point that whey in itself might not even be the most efficient one when consumed alone.  I assume it still has some use in fasted training like IF, which I've done previously, but that's for a minuscule amount of the people that consume it."
AdvancedFitness,27skuy,mglsts,7,Tue Jun 10 18:21:26 2014 UTC,"The answers are still the same.    If we're going to be sticklers, you can't extrapolate.    If we're not going to be sticklers, then the answer is maybe.    The nuances are exactly what lead to these results.  They are specific to the conditions in which they are gathered.  The more you deviate from those conditions the shakier your assumptions get.    So, do you often workout and then not eat anything until an hour later?  And at that point do you only consume a mixture of whey and water (or milk)?  Do you then not eat anything for another 4 hours?  Unless your real world experience mimic this, you probably can't apply much of it.    And even if this is your exact setup, is your training and the rest of your diet so perfectly optimized that any slight superiority of milk, if it exists, will be realized?"
AdvancedFitness,27skuy,eric_twinge,4,Tue Jun 10 17:27:15 2014 UTC,"I realize that, and I'm aware you can't directly extrapolate with 100% certainty, which is why I asked if my assumption would be plausible at the very least, by asking the collective knowledge of this subreddit.  Yes, I have actually done fasted training with IF and not eaten until quite a bit after since it curbed my hunger so much I didn't feel like eating (I was not a smart man I know...). I will probably resume IF and fasted training in the final stages of my cut, since I find it helps me with hunger quite significantly.   When I did that, I didn't consume whey supplements. I just ate one or two big meals a while after workout, but this time around I want to optimize it as bit more if possible. This is why I'm interested in this study, because it might be useful to me now that I use protein supplements and might resume IF shortly. And also to be honest I really like how whey with milk tastes so, it would be nice to have something to back it up, other than just taste lol.  No it's not so ""perfectly optimized"", but one thing is study that says ""If you hang yourself from your feet for an hour after working out, there is a chance of an increase in your gains by 2%"", to which I would say ""screw that"".   Another is one that says that simply ""Adding milk to whey might increase gains by 2% and at the very least it doesn't make much difference from just whey with water"", it's simple, it doesn't take extra time or effort, so why not implement such an optimization if it's there?  Damn this really took an extremely complicated detour, but I appreciate your replies."

That means just eating more of the same incomplete protein will never provide all of the essential amino acids. As a result combining complimentary incomplete proteins, or consuming one or more complete protein, will always be better than consuming only one incomplete protein, no matter how much of that incomplete protein you're consuming.  And digging a little deeper I don't really see what this has to do with the study discussed, as both whey and casein are complete proteins.  If you want to criticize the study then point out the the two groups (blend vs. whey) consumed a different amount of protein (20.1g vs. 17.3g) immediately post exercise, with the group with the favorable outcome consuming more."

I have no problem with the study, I have a problem with the title and suggesting there this is a necessary topic of interest for the average lifter.   Also, there is a reason why ""incomplete"" is in quotations. Many foods are labeled ""incomplete"" not because they have zero of a particular amino acid, they might only have 50%.

An extra tip: dont sit all the way up, come up to about 60° before lying back for another sit-up, this further reduces back stress and increases the stress on the abs since beyond about 60° your hip-flexors take over and your abs rest.

A lot of people will say this exercise puts a lot of pressure on the spine, but if you do it the way I just said it won't. However, it does require a decent amount of abdominal strength to be able to keep proper form so it's not a good exercise for beginners.

It doesn't properly train the abs, it more likely strains the hips and back. So crunches is the better standard.  So, since you have a ""few weeks"" then I suggest you do many different exercises that protects your back so you won't injure your back during this activity.

AdvancedFitness,27krvk,gloomchen,1 point,Sun Jun 8 13:38:36 2014 UTC,So I just read the whole series. I don't understand why they put down salt tablets. If the whole problem with sports drink is that the salt concentration is so low wouldn't the salt tablets be a much better solution. And I also am curious as to whether a loss of water has any negative effects even though the sodium concentration is ok.
AdvancedFitness,27krvk,doublemilkplus,3,Sun Jun 8 04:23:54 2014 UTC,"They put down salt tablets because there is simply no need for them so long as one doesn't over-hydrate, which is taken care of by simply drinking to thirst. This strategy, even for extreme endurance events, keeps hydration at levels where performance in not negatively affected while also keeping sodium (and other electrolyte) from dropping to clinically significantly low concentration levels.  If there's no need for salt tablets, why use them? If they give you a mental boost, that's one thing, but they don't serve a physical purpose."
AdvancedFitness,27krvk,r4d4r_3n5,2,Sun Jun 8 11:39:05 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I'm sure they are probably correct. But as they said questioning is the best way to learn... So in their examples with ""randy"" they only focus on the concentration of sodium. In their Ideal example randy loses 2L of liquid and drinks 1L of water. I'm curious as to weather losing a litre of liquid would have some sort of effect on performance or health even though the concentrations are the same. Shouldn't the ideal situation be to return the body back to where it started? Would it be possible to replace 100% of the fluids while maintaining a good concentration level? Hypothetically speaking if one was to drink 100% of the sweat that they lose, would they have the same exact levels as when they started?  Thanks so much for answering my questions.  I find this very interest and am somewhat annoyingly inquisitive."
AdvancedFitness,27krvk,metron2321,2,Sun Jun 8 16:05:58 2014 UTC,"How is your sleep? I've been dealing with toe/foot/calf cramps for years. I started tracking my hydration, magnesium and electrolyte supplementation, comparing my food intake and exercise exertion levels, the whole nine yards. The only common thread I found that really made the cramps worse was when I'd have 2 or more nights of crappy sleep. All of the other stuff could help (and it would be worse without supplementation and such), but ultimately, I needed consistent sleep to shake them off."
AdvancedFitness,27krvk,ghostmcspiritwolf,1 point,Sat Jun 7 23:38:43 2014 UTC,"Hmm. Thats really interesting. I get about 6-8 hours consistently. However,  I would usually go to bed really early the night before games and thats when I had problems so I don't know if thats the problem."
AdvancedFitness,27krvk,7thKingdom,1 point,Sun Jun 8 02:39:43 2014 UTC,"Took this same problem to my family doctor, prescribed 8oz of tonic water per day. He said the quinine prevents cramping, and while it is entirely anecdotal, I report 100% effectiveness. I usually do a 4-6 oz glass an hour before working out, and another 4oz glass before bed (used to wake up cramping after any hard day).  Worked for me, cheap and harmless."

When I was in high school, I mostly got cramps at night, and only when I 1) skipped lunch (which also caused me headaches) or b) was cold.   I rarely got on-the-field cramps.  You say you didn't eat meat before; has changing your diet changed the duration/severity/frequency of the cramps you're having?   Oddly enough, while I was hyperthyroid (eight years ending last summer) I didn't get nighttime cramps as I was always over-warm, but now that I'm not anymore, I do get cold at night again and I've had occasional cramping.  It sure beats the bed-soaking night sweats I had before. :)"

AdvancedFitness,27krvk,craftadvisory,0,Sun Jun 8 02:40:44 2014 UTC,"are you always cramping in the same muscles? if so might just be a conditioning issue. if not, you could try potassium supplements, some people have luck with that."
AdvancedFitness,27krvk,djfeelgood,1 point,Sat Jun 7 22:49:01 2014 UTC,It usually starts in the calves but then everything else does too. And I really don't think it's conditioning because I've been through a pretty rigorous offseason this year and still have problems. Thanks for the input!
AdvancedFitness,27krvk,broscientologist,0,Sun Jun 8 02:37:03 2014 UTC,"I used to get frequent (and bad) calf cramps.  My first piece of advice would be to ditch the creatine for a while.  No matter how much I hydrate I always cramp more when using creatine.  I also agree with someone above that supplementing magnesium may help.  I've also personally found potassium and vitamin K useful to help prevent cramping (be careful supplementing potassium though).  But, by and large, my #1 piece of advice would be to figure out WHERE your cramping is stemming from.  What I mean is, while it may be your calves that usually cramp up, the problem may actually be higher up.  Tight hamstrings, glutes, or even a lower back could very well put extra stress on your calves and eventually cause those cramps.  I'd wager at the base level, it is a ""trunk""/core issue that is triggering your muscle cramps.  Stretch out and foam roll (foam rolling/deep tissue massage of those areas has been HUGELY beneficial to me) the shit out of those upper legs/lower back and try to keep them as loose as possible and hopefully the frequency of cramps will go down."
AdvancedFitness,27jzjb,Derpost,1 point,Sat Jun 7 16:03:15 2014 UTC,There is 4 days of sprinting in 12 days.. Isn't that enough?
AdvancedFitness,27jzjb,Don_Clucas,1 point,Sun Jun 8 02:25:39 2014 UTC,"I'm no expert on sprint training (at all), but when I was competing in x-country skiing our coach had us do a lot of dynamic effort squats; sub maximal loading for 2-4 reps focusing on speed. I would think that as a sprinter doing paused squats at a lower weight with an emphasis on exploding out of the hole would build your power off the blocks too. Therefore a Dynamic Effort Lower day could help.  EDIT: the coach in question trained many skiers who were competitive in the winter olympics."
AdvancedFitness,27jzjb,Don_Clucas,-1,Sun Jun 8 09:54:02 2014 UTC,Actually I know how important is Dynamic Effort training but I have thinked that sprinting is the Dynamic Effort work. If I put the special Dynamic Effort day there won't be time to train on track.

AdvancedFitness,27fgzw,mattlikespeoples,7,Fri Jun 6 00:17:19 2014 UTC,"The main difference isn't in ""overtraining syndrome"" but in the higher incidence of repetitive stress injuries during endurance training.  Shin splints, bone spurs in the ankles, stress fractures of the metatarsals and tibia, stuff like that is unique to endurance training (although tendonitis happens in both types of training).  I'd be more concerned with those types of stress injuries, far more concerned, than I would be about any generalized ""overtraining syndrome."""
AdvancedFitness,27fgzw,youtri,1 point,Fri Jun 6 02:41:52 2014 UTC,"For, shin splints, I was always taught to run through it. Is this a big no-no?

AdvancedFitness,27fgzw,mattlikespeoples,2,Fri Jun 6 04:29:18 2014 UTC,http://www.runnersworld.com/tag/shin-splints  They also have a very active injury forum at Runner's World where the topic comes up frequently.
AdvancedFitness,27fgzw,youtri,1 point,Fri Jun 6 12:41:01 2014 UTC,I'm no runner but I do know that shin splints are usually caused by improper running form. If you aren't landing either mid foot or fore foot then tibialis anterior is going to have a lot of work to do slowing your foot down during heel strike so your toes don't just slap the ground each time.
AdvancedFitness,27fgzw,camo1902,2,Fri Jun 6 09:07:53 2014 UTC,It is not the foot strike pattern that matters but rather ensuring that one does not over-stride.  There are plenty of elite and weekend warrior heel strikers out there.  (site is currently down but Ross Tucker's Science of Sport blog covers this in detail as well as Steve Magness)
AdvancedFitness,27fgzw,mattlikespeoples,0,Sat Jun 7 00:58:50 2014 UTC,"I said I wasn't a runner and when thinking about over-striding would probably be the main cause but if you land with your feet under you (as I think they're supposed to, right) then a smaller fraction of your weight would be on your heel strike for less time anyways. Also, I can imagine that over-striding while running on your toes feels unnatural anyways."
AdvancedFitness,27fgzw,hercaptamerica,2,Sat Jun 7 15:59:07 2014 UTC,The problem with the initial statement though is that it implies that mid foot/fore foot striking is proper and heel striking is improper running form.  This leads to people change their running form who really should not or do not need to  change their form and ends up exacerbating the problem.
AdvancedFitness,27fgzw,mattlikespeoples,2,Sat Jun 7 16:12:15 2014 UTC,"From my experience its the same thing. Motivation crashes, body is excessively sore, performance is seriously impacted. I take a couple of days rest and am good to go again."

AdvancedFitness,27fgzw,porker912,6,Fri Jun 6 04:30:15 2014 UTC,"There's an argument that there's no such thing as overtraining, just under recovery. Stupid argument but it highlights the keys to help offset overtraining: rest and recovery. Increasing the amount of sleep and pre/post training rehab as well as making sure diet is in check give the body the fuel it needs to rebuild.   Ideally you'd load up on 8+ hrs/night, foods high in lean proteins, carbs and plenty of veggies/fruits for antioxidants/micronutrients and proper warm up and cool down ever session. Most people don't live in an ideal world."
AdvancedFitness,27fgzw,amaye15,1 point,Fri Jun 6 09:13:53 2014 UTC,"I've always said that as well. Unless you have access to the ""ideal"" amount of rest, then arguing the difference between overtraining and under resting is semantics."

AdvancedFitness,27fgzw,IDOWNVOTECATSONSIGHT,2,Fri Jun 6 17:01:43 2014 UTC,"Yes, different types of overtraining result in different effects, and there are actually recovery modalities that are better suited to each type, although there are a lot that work well for either type."

AdvancedFitness,27a8ll,pethebi,7,Thu Jun 5 02:09:37 2014 UTC,"He doesn't really fully explain how certain things are bad. I'm going to discuss cortisol because I am most familiar with it. In this article, the author discusses how cortisol is bad for you, but he doesn't elaborate enough. Cortisol is a tricky hormone because it is bad for you when you have chronically high levels, but acutely it's beneficial for you. He mentions this difference, but does not state what is considered chronically high levels. From this article, he seems to be implying that having high levels of cortisol is bad for you and does not say what is considered chronic and what is considered acute. The difference is, marathon runners can train up to 50-60 miles per week. If someone trains like that for years, that is a lot of accumulated stress on one's body, which can lead to a lot of detrimental effects. For somebody who isn't aware of a marathoner's training schedule, they can read this and assume that running is bad for you.  Second, this author is giving examples of ultra marathon runners and professional athletes. This is not a good way to describe why running is bad for you because professional athletes and ultra marathoners are at the extreme end. Statistically speaking, athletes typically have shorter life spans because of how much exercise they do and this causes extreme stress on their bodies.  Finally, the author does not provide citations to his sources in APA or MLA format, which makes it difficult to fact check his arguments. He is discussing his points using various scientists' interpretations of data without providing the actual data.  TL;DR: In short, this author is partially correct. He doesn't provide the whole story. I only read the abstract, but the link /u/GreatGonzo provided is what the general consensus is around the harms and benefits of running as exercise training."

At the other, you have science (like this) and real-world experience (say, Conjugate Method) backing up the idea of variation.   Somewhere in the middle you have bodybuilders who draw on decades of haphazard anecdotes cobbled together from people who did well with this or that program.  And near that you have decent trainers who know that squatting, pressing and pulling will bore the hell out of soccer moms and teenage boys and they'll quit before seeing results. So they use the dumb anthropomorphic buzzword instead of a more accurate term while they rotate exercises in and out to keep their clients interested."

In this regard, it seems that when training volume is equated between groups (i.e. sets x repetitions) and the intensity varies between 6-10RM, similar CSA gains are achieved regardless of the exercise variations."

I think Westside's conjugate system, which i assumed you're referrin to, works just fine but that doesn't mean it's not without flaws.  The conjugate system, as we know it, is concurrent periodization; the training of multiple abilities at once (speed-strength & max strength, for example). The rotating of exercises doesn't have to be a staple of concurrent periodization although Westside has made the two seemingly inseprable. I wouldn't quite use this as evidence that rotating exercises will prove to be best for an elite powerlifter looking to get stronger. There are a lot of variables in something like that. I think this tends to carry more weight in the bodybuilding world where symmetry and things of that nature are valued."

There's a big focus on programming and proper progression... as in client scenario type questions and the ""best"" way to approach the situation. Not nearly as much anatomy as I had planned on, but since you have some time I would highly recommend going through the Anatomy Coloring Book. You can find it on amazon, and it's a valuable resource for learning the skeletal and muscle groups. There's quite a bit of scope of practice stuff as well from what I recall.  If you've sprung for the extra materials, then you should have access to a couple of practice tests. These are a pretty good representation of the actual test... so make sure to go through those when you feel confident and use it as a gauge to see how you'll do.

I'm actually disappointed that I didn't learn more useful information during my prep for the exam.  If I could pick a certification over again, I would have gone with the NSCA certification as they are supposed to be more comprehensive across the board.    Overall though, I'm not sure that where you get your certificate matters (as long as it's ACE, ACSM, NASM, or NSCA) as much as having a good mentor or a degree in Exercise Science behind it.

For  example, trained athletes show little improvement in VO2 max in response to RT, which is likely a  function of their level of trainability. Therefore, the value of RT may differ with respect to the  population considered. It is very likely that people who are either untrained or not involved in  organized sporting competition, but who have the desire to improve their CV fitness may find value in  RT performed to failure. In fact, this review suggests that RT to failure can produce CV fitness effects  while simultaneously producing improvements in strength, power, and other health and fitness  variables (48). This would present an efficient investment of time as the person would not have to  perform several independent training programs for differing aspects of fitness."""

They are still testing and retesting General and Special Relativity, Evolution, all theories, why, because that is how good science is done.  Repeat to validate, especially in older studies.  Never said they were bad, but there is the possibility of out dated or inaccurate information.  Again, show me how this is an inaccurate statement.  http://www.texashste.com/documents/curriculum/scientific_research_design/the_scientific_literature_review.pdf  Notice in the above listed source, they suggest 2 to 3 yrs.  I was taught in grad school no more than 5 if possible given the subject.   Again, if as a researcher, you find many of the studies are old, it suggests the need for new work.  There are also possible problems in any lit review or meta, due to its construction.  http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/3/1/253.full  ""This type of publication type has many potential limitations that should be appreciated by all readers. First, the summary provided in a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature is only as reliable as the methods used to estimate the effect in each of the primary studies. In other words, conducting a meta-analysis does not overcome problems that were inherent in the design and execution of the primary studies. It also does not correct biases as a result of selective publication, whereby studies that report dramatic effects are more likely to be identified, summarized, and subsequently pooled in meta-analysis than studies that report smaller effect sizes (an issue referred to as publication bias). Because more than three quarters of meta-analyses did not report any empirical assessment of publication bias (35), the true frequency of this form of bias is unknown.  Controversies also arise around the interpretation of summarized results, particularly when the results of discordant studies are pooled in meta-analysis (36). The review process inevitably identifies studies that are diverse in their design, methodologic quality, specific interventions used, and types of patients studied. There is often some subjectivity when deciding how similar studies must be before pooling is appropriate. Combining studies of poor quality with those that were more rigorously conducted may not be useful and can lead to worse estimates of the underlying truth or a false sense of precision around the truth (36). A false sense of precision may also arise when various subgroups of patients defined by characteristics such as their age or gender differ in their observed response. In such cases, reporting an aggregate pooled effect might be misleading if there are important reasons to explain variable treatment effects across different types of patients (36–40).  Finally, simply labeling a manuscript as a “systematic review” or “meta-analysis” does not guarantee that the review was conducted or reported with due rigor (41). To reduce the chance of arriving at misleading conclusions, guidelines on the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews were recently published (42,43); however, important methodologic flaws of systematic reviews published in peer-reviewed journals have been well described (44–54). For example, of the 86 renal systematic reviews published in 2005, the majority (58%) had important methodologic flaws (Mrkobrada M, Thiessen-Philbrook H, Haynes RB, Iansavichus AV, Rehman F, and Garg AX, submitted). The most common flaws among these renal reviews were failure to assess the methodologic quality of included primary studies and failure to avoid bias in study inclusion (Mrkobrada M, Thiessen-Philbrook H, Haynes RB, Iansavichus AV, Rehman F, and Garg AX, submitted). In some cases, industry-supported reviews of drugs have had fewer reservations about methodologic limitations of the included trials than rigorously conducted Cochrane reviews on the same topic (10); however, the hypothesis that less rigorous reviews more often report positive conclusions than good-quality reviews of the same topic has not been borne out in empirical assessment (48,53,55). Nonetheless, like all good consumers, users of systematic reviews should carefully consider the quality of the product and adhere to the dictum “caveat emptor”: Let the buyer beware. The limitations described in this section may explain differences in the results of meta-analyses as compared with subsequent large, randomized, controlled trials, which have occurred in approximately one third of cases (56).""  Never said the conclusions were wrong in the lit review, never said it was a bad review.  I stated that the age of many of the studies listed suggest it is time for some new studies.  Again, show me how that is wrong.  Also, given that we are taught in science to rely, when possible on newer studies, also don't see how that is wrong.  Also, to rely on the fact that the authors lit review as comprehensive is a possible mistake.    So keep tossing your wikis at me, apparently you can't write your own arguments.

To get a sense of the correct position, lie on the ground relaxed, and notice the gap between your lower back and the floor (most people can slide a hand in relaxed). The proper lower back posture can be simulated by contracting your abs to flatten your back against the ground. This is the posture you want to hold while sprinting.   Once you know the proper posture, it takes a long time to get it fully ingrained into your sprinting motor pattern to the point where it helps you.

You have pointed out the lack of knee recovery, but to improve on it I would have you focus on PUSHING big and long. If done properly this will force the opposite knee higher for the right reasons, and might serve to help you get into a more optimal sprint form.  If you watch the 11.04.2014 video, from the beginning notice how your legs are not fully extending each pushoff. Here is a video of some sprinters fully extending for comparison. Not only does pushing longer help you to get more impulse for each stride, it sets up the knee into a better strike position for the next stride, AND put the extended leg into a stretched position where you'll get some elastic recovery.  I would encourage you, especially during your drive phase, to work on pushing long, and keeping your feet low to the ground in the first few steps, as well as feeling your legs go long behind you. If you do this and maintain good hip posture you should find your knee recovery goes as high as your mobility allows."
AdvancedFitness,26sk5a,Vv0rd,1 point,Thu May 29 16:58:25 2014 UTC,"I tried focus on feeling my hip few times. I put my fingers on my hips I cannot feel any squeezing.   My strides are short because can't use my hips. But I think that after solve that main problem, I must try to practice good posture as you say.."
AdvancedFitness,26sk5a,dasmountain,1 point,Thu May 29 17:46:26 2014 UTC,"Your hips are firing, you wouldn't look anywhere close to a sprint stride if they weren't!  The key is adjusting your motor pattern to put you in a better position to sprint fast. Don't get hung up on one element of the pattern (hip activation). The movement is too holistic for that. It's more about adjusting the limiting parts of the movement to allow everything to come together. A more powerful and longer drive into the ground will MAKE your hip work more efficiently, and will likely do much more than just thinking about your hips!"
AdvancedFitness,26sk5a,khowington,2,Thu May 29 18:22:44 2014 UTC,"I think like others have said, lower crossed syndrome may definitely be a factor. Keep doing hip flexor stretches, but make sure that you are doing variations to hit the psoas as well as the rectus femoris. Do some glute re-ed work like supine hip thrusts and lateral work like monster walks to teach you how to use your glutes again. Do you do any sort of ab stability work? That might help again to alleviate some anterior pelvic tilt.   Also, yeah, sprint coaching would be beneficial, but in the mean time you can do plenty of things to help recruit the glutes in active movement. Try doing walking lunges, taking a big step out and really focusing on squeezing the glutes on the ascent of each step. Stepups onto a box, 12-18 inches tall, could help as well, if you make sure the knee doesn't pass over the toes much. Also, try doing wall squats(facing a wall) with your toes only 1-2 inches away from the wall. This will force you to sit back into your hips and utilize your glutes rather than your quads as the prime mover."

AdvancedFitness,26sk5a,mrcosmicna,0,Tue Jun 3 00:32:20 2014 UTC,"Sounds like partially motor control, partially bad mobility.  Do any number of glute-activating exercises, I like glute marches and side planks. When running, actively think of pushing your hips through your legs. Also, squeezingyour erector muscles doesnt have to make your back straight if you have a bad holding pattern in place (kinda like how you can squeeze the hell out of your bicep without your arm closing all the way). Use your glutes to set your hips staight and forward, your lower back has to follow since it's attached.   If you sit a lot, your hips are probably really junked up and tight. Mobilize everything, and do a lot of kelly starretts 'couch stretch' specifically."

AdvancedFitness,26lu4s,AhmedF,12,Tue May 27 14:12:12 2014 UTC,"Interesting...   Study consisted primarily of overweight-obese White and African American women (80% female; 68% White and 27% African American) Weight loss target was 1-2 lbs per week. Physical activity was targeted, but not limited or otherwise controlled. Non-nutritive sweetened (NNS) consumers were given coupons to any qualifying beverage from Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Dr Pepper Snapple. There was no distinction between caffeinated or non-caffeinated consumption. NNS consumers lost, on average, 4 lbs more than water consumers over 12 weeks. This averages out to a third of a pound per week.   Overall, I'm satisfied with this study as long as it's contextualized by the fact that water and NNS beverages are neither equal nor superior to one another. (I know, this is a bit confusing). I really would have liked the study to differentiate between caffeinated and non-caffeinated beverages in the NNS group. I'd like to think caffeine does some magical things with hunger."

I think the data also fits their explanation, that people had an easier time on caloric restriction when they could drink diet soda.

They've found through very transient bouts of SD, there's a HUGE shift in the metabolome. On top of that, they've noticed shifts in myriad hormones, and thus deleterious effects on insulin sensitivity/glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, blood pressure, systemic inflammation, etc. Then, looking more, they've found noxious results on memory and overall LTP expression through just a few hours of SD, or up to long bouts of it.

That is, during the day, you are in a catabolic state, hormones like adrenaline and cortisol are elevated. Heart rate and breathing is increased, the body and the mind are ready for action, and in order to be in that ""ready"" state, so to speak, you're in a temporary state of breakdown. During sleep, you enter an anabolic state where hormones like adrenaline and cortisol drop to very low levels, and growth hormone is elevated. Heart rate and breathing slow, body temperature drops slightly and at points during certain sleep cycles, your are basically paralyzed which allows muscles to relax even beyond what could be achieved just by sitting while awake. This is a temporary state of anabolism with the caveat of being in a temporary state of unconsciousness and vulnerability.  ELI5: When you are awake, you are breaking your body and mind down faster than it can recover and this is happening to some extent regardless of your activity level, just by being ""alert"" this is happening. In order to rebuild the ""damage"" that was incurred (for recovery to be enhanced and breakdown to be minimized), you need to sleep."

They postulate that the fasted state (catabolism) puts the body in ""repair mode"".  To me it makes intuitive sense (I'm not a doctor) that the body needs ""off"" periods like sleep or fast in order to tidy up stuff."
AdvancedFitness,269hxr,Angels1928,3,Fri May 23 08:59:59 2014 UTC,Doesn't fasting increase the levels of adrenaline and cortisol in your body?

AdvancedFitness,269hxr,Ballaticianaire,1 point,Sat May 24 23:15:33 2014 UTC,"This is indeed one of the reasons intermittent fasting is so beneficial. You get different molecular pathways of expression that will increase stress resistance and thus probably help some mitohormesis (FoxO expression, sirtuin expression, AMPK expression, adiponectin secretion, PGC-1 alpha expression, etc). With those as well, you have myriad benefits, such as increased DNA repair, autophagy, apoptosis of damaged cells, ameliorated blood lipid levels, increased insulin sensitivity, etc etc. This is why I think IF is so strongly beneficial, vs constant eating, which would stimulate a chronic mTOR expression, which would increase rate of aging, initiate some tissue damage, lead to cell senescence, ER stress, unfolded protein accumulation, stem cell pool exhaustion, etc. Despite this, there's no evidence to think overall hypertrophy would be hindered in any way, with such a protocol. That's further corroborated by the fact that, during exercise, it's an alpha 2 isoform of AMPK that's expressed, which doesn't antagonize mTOR as usual, so you get the powerful benefits of both through exercise. Plus the 16-20 hr fasting window isn't really going to begin gnawing on your muscles just yet."
AdvancedFitness,269hxr,pethebi,2,Sat May 24 23:23:26 2014 UTC,"To be perfectly honest. The science doesn't actually know what exactly is going on and we do not know what the specific mechanisms are. We just know the cause and effects. A lot of this has to do with the fact that neuroscience is still fairly new and the fact that sleep research isn't exactly a ""hot"" topic. One thing is for sure, the neurotransmitters that are released while you are awake is vastly different from the neurotransmitters released at different stages of sleep. A lot of the drugs that induce sleep are not effective and often leave you tired (such as benzodiazepines and alcohol) the next day because they don't actually put you to sleep even though you feel tired. It's more of a comatose state because the neurotransmitters are different.  I'm on my phone right now and I'm not going to search for primary literature, but we do know 1) different stages of sleep (REM AND NREM1-4) is beneficial to different areas. For example, different types of cognition (e.g spacial vs. language) will be affected differently based on what stage is deprived. 2) different periods of your night (i.e. Beginning of the 8 hours or end of the 8 hours) has an effect on different areas as well. For example, a lot of motor skills are learned / reinforced towards the end of the night.  Source: psychology of sleep course from undergrad."

So you would do 600 on fasting days and the regular 3000 on the normal days. It seems to be more of a caloric restriction protocol/IF than a pure alternate day fasting one.  Now if you want to maintain weight, while still reaping the other health benefits that are associated with fasting/caloric restriction, then I assume you would up the intake to the 5400 cals on non-fasting days.

This would mean in a week you work on strength, speed and endurance in the same week, as opposed to starting with high volume and moving into high intensity over the course of weeks. They both work, but I would advise moderation between the two.

As to the results, the benefit of linear periodization is that it gives you focus on each parameter at a time, while with conjugate periodization you have to work on everything at once. It will work, but I would think moderation between the two would work best. That is, regularly do training that is very similar to the race you are going to be competing in while applying secondary focus in improving supporting qualities, like work capacity or endurance. As the race nears focus more and more on training that is closer and closer to actually racing.  Edit: what are you actually racing and how exactly do you usually train?"

AdvancedFitness,264ksa,Skizm,14,Wed May 21 15:43:01 2014 UTC,"My #1 rule is listen to your body. In my experience, when I feel like you do, it's time to take a week off. I always come back to the gym feeling refreshed, and in a lot of cases, stronger than I was. I am also a fan of active recovery. So during that week I do things like walk a lot, ride my bike (low intensity), swim, and stretch more.  I often find I need a recovery week after my eating or sleeping take a hit and I'm still lifting hard. If you've been consistently lifting hard for a while, an active recovery week will probably help more than it hurts your strength gains."
AdvancedFitness,264ksa,BakedPanda,2,Wed May 21 17:26:27 2014 UTC,"Yea, this is probably a good idea. Like I mentioned to wooq, I've been going hard for about 18 months now. Which is a longer stretch than I've ever done before (for sports I usually am not in the weightroom in-season very often). I do de-load weeks every 5 or so weeks, but I'm still in the gym lifting weights/running/whatever. Probably time to back off for a week for so."
AdvancedFitness,264ksa,wooq,6,Wed May 21 18:13:38 2014 UTC,"Gains don't come from exercise.  They come from the REST after exercise, when your body compensates for damaged tissues by repairing them a bit stronger.  Recovery time varies, but you should give at LEAST a day or two off before working the same muscle group again, and bearing in mind it takes over two weeks for you to start losing gains you have made (and it takes much longer for your body to repair cartilage and connective tissue than muscle).  Also, a ""de-load"" week can do wonders to let your body catch up with repairs... every 4-6 weeks take a week where you don't lift as heavy, often, or at as high a volume.  Here's a good article on it..   For the soreness in the patella, how about a form check?  If your heels are lifting off the ground during the squat or your feet are two narrow/wide you might be putting sheer stresses on your patella."
AdvancedFitness,264ksa,sharkiteuthis,3,Wed May 21 17:43:47 2014 UTC,"My programming has de-load weeks at about that interval. De-loads for me are about 60 - 70% normal workload and usually an extra day off (4 days instead of 5).  As for form, I could always use a refresher; however, I've been in and out of the gym for around 12 years now and been squatting and doing cleans for most of them. Never had this issue before. I could be wrong but I am fairly certain it is an over use issue. This is the first time I've been on the same program for more than 6 months or so and definitely the first time I've been going to the gym for this long (18 months) with no significant time off (those 18 months are counting de-load weeks).  Thanks for the article though. I think I probably need to take the advice at the bottom and just not go to the gym for a week. I definitely get it in my head, when I see other people in my gym making awesome gains, that I just need to put in more work. I probably end up shooting myself in the foot (or knee in this case)."

I switch up an accessory movement or two every month, so different things are constantly rotating in and out. Since the accessories are the ones that you tend to get more volume on, IMO you're more prone to overuse injuries if you don't rotate them. You only need 2-3 variations if you do it this way.  I don't ever not squat/bench/pull, but I'll either take a week off of the main lifts sometimes or stop at 40-60% and do fast singles (pull) or doubles (squat/bench) about every seventh week."

AdvancedFitness,264ksa,Seantheguy,1 point,Wed May 21 20:52:34 2014 UTC,"olympic lifters do 2x/day.   Not all of them, and they work up to that kind of volume slowly. Also, it's a self-selecting thing (particularly re: Bulgarians), where the people who couldn't hack it on that volume just wash out. And the oly movements are sufficiently complex that it's more like practice than training for lifters at that level.  That said, high-frequency training is something anyone can do if you program intelligently - look at what Chad Waterbury, for example, advocates - switching up exercises and rep ranges throughout the week.  And if volume or intensity is kept low on individual training days, training the same lift every day is a great way to make fast neurological gains on compound movements."
AdvancedFitness,264ksa,AhmedF,2,Thu May 22 00:43:27 2014 UTC,"I let life plan my breaks, it is good to take an extended rest every now and then. It depends on the individual how often this should be done, I aim for 2-3 times a year of around 5 days of rest. Usually there are a few times a year when I am simply not able to train for whatever reason (life stuff), so I just welcome the break.  Make sure you eat a lot of protein and get enough sleep."
AdvancedFitness,264ksa,AhmedF,2,Wed May 21 23:22:27 2014 UTC,"I recently have been following a bulgarian style method (max every day, multiple lifts, twice a day). From january 1st - april 25th I maxed my squat every day for 100# increase over 4 months. I think you can push your body harder than you give yourself credit. You may want to make sure though that your form is as close to perfect on every lift as possible. Also if you do feel extremely run down rest is always beneficial.   As any good coach will say - you can't out eat bad training, and you can't out train bad sleep. Meaning if your training is lacking in intensity, all the food in the world won't make you stronger. If you don't get adequate rest though, all the intensity in the world will not make you stronger.   Triangles are the strongest geometric shape. Think of food, rest and training as corners of a triangle. If one corner gets too far away from the others the triangle becomes lop sided and more stress is displaced in the other corners. If all angles are equal and you increase each equally the triangle becomes larger & stronger. You can push one area fairly hard and make decent gains, but unless you increase the other two the potential is always limited."

I agree with this.   I'd also throw in some of what we've learned from the field of behavioral economics...  Make healthy eating the 'default' option so people don't have to exert willpower; sometimes they don't even need to be informed on nutrition. For example, if you put the healthy items first in the buffet table, and the unhealthy items last, people eat fewer calories. People also eat fewer calories if you give them smaller plates. Or if the buffet food has healthfulness ratings (e.g. 'green light' for eat as much as you want, 'yellow light' for foods you should try to moderate, 'red light' for indulgent foods). In the grocery stores, put the healthy foods at eye-level and take the unhealthy impulse-buys away from the checkout lines.

Most of these people have never made it under 10>% bodyfat.  People suck at being consistent with caloric deficits and they suck at keeping track of calories. They are really really good at overestimating their caloric expenditure though.
AdvancedFitness,25wg5d,down_vote_city__,1 point,Tue Jun 3 13:35:19 2014 UTC,"Agreed, my fav quote towards the CICO ""only"" thought is from Alan Aragon...  “Yes, a calorie is a calorie when viewed as a unit of measurement – just like a gram is a gram or a liter is a liter. However, saying that “a calorie is a calorie” can evoke the false idea that the macronutrients all have the same energetic cost of processing within the body. It also neglects to make the distinction between gross energy and physiologically available energy. It goes without saying that the macronutrients have different physiological and morphological roles aside from their common role of providing energy. So the problem with saying “a calorie is a calorie” boils down to the ability of that catchphrase to mislead through its oversimplicity.”"

It encompasses volatile chemical sprays which range from placebo feel-good cold to treating lung cancer. MD guided cryotherapy can also treat keloid scars.  Everyday cryotherapy includes cold compresses like gameready, actual ice, and even cold whirlpool baths can be useful for acute injuries when trying to mitigate swelling and pain post acute injury, e.g. sprained ankle or tendonitis to interrupt the pain-inflammation cycle. It is limited by depth of penetration - the everyday cryotherapy physical agents are limited to 2 cm source. I have used cryotherapy for myself - works great for plantar fascia pain and achilles tendinopathy; no more than 20 min of an hour - and for others, who have responded favorably."
AdvancedFitness,25ogk6,eshlow,2,Mon May 19 05:35:06 2014 UTC,"As a PT I've stopped using ice pretty much at all. For most injuries with some type of swelling, compression is more effective than ice there.  If it's not swelling, a movement based approach (MEAT -- movement, exercise, analgesics, treatment) is more effective than RICE.  Sprain your ankle? Do mobility in the non-painful range and then keep increasing as it starts to feel better and injuries that take 2-3+ weeks to heal with immobilization and ice are healed in 2-3 days with MEAT approach.  I do like contrast baths though for flushing areas with poor circulation with blood to ""speed up"" healing. Seems to work well for the hands and other such areas.  I haven't read up on literature in the past year though, so it is what it is. I go with what works ""better"" if I can find something better that works."

AdvancedFitness,25ogk6,JonasTrain,1 point,Mon May 19 21:40:04 2014 UTC,"I think the studies are fairly inconclusive on this.  One of the things I think that is being overlooked in the literature is that movement is a blood/fluid pump in itself. The muscle action will help flush the area of some of the swelling.  Likewise, secondary hypoxia is definitely an issue, but if the blood flow is increased then it becomes less of an issue.  Granted, I can't say I've used the approach more than just with sprains though such as with partial ligament tears and whatnot, so I can't be sure until there are actually conclusive studies on this."

Additionally, I like ice (or cold rather) in terms of contrast therapy (cold and hot) with baths or showers or water to bring blood flow to the area. Just cold does this a bit (see chinese weightlifters supposedly icing testicles to increase blood flow to increase testosterone), but not as effectively as contrasting to enable full capillary dilation and contraction effect.  I'm not convinced just ice itself is useful, albeit if used extensively with mobility work I think it may be effective.

If there is true damage to the body it takes time to heal and repair itself. I'm a physical therapist and think topical modalities distraction the patient and make them think they are getting better. Ive forgotten to take the cap of the ultrasound machine a few times and people tell me they feel great afterwards. Unless rubbing the ultrasound head on them counts as a massage it was all placebo.

But it develops hypertrophy in your heart and makes the sidewalls of your heart thicker while not really giving you larger volume in your ventricles (which is what makes a heart really efficient).    It really depends on your goals for training - are you doing endurance events?  I would say do polarized training.  Are you doing shorter events and you don't want to train for long periods of time?

AdvancedFitness,25ksyw,randomAnonymousThing,2,Wed May 14 22:39:24 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure how accurate you would like to get with this, but from my understanding of your question this is what I can tell you.    You can play with the following equations to figure out some walking or running intensity and durations for your subjects in order to figure out how much calories they are expending.    Running VO2 = 0.2(speed) + 0.9(speed) (fractional grade) + 3.5 Walking VO2 = 0.1(speed) + 1.8(speed) (fractional grade) + 3.5    If your speed is in MPH on a treadmill you need to convert to m/s (multiply MPH x 26.8). Fractional grade is the incline on the treadmill in decimal form (10% grade = 0.1, 5% grade = 0.05, etc.).    This formula gives you an estimation of VO2max in mL/kg/min. Once you have your value you need to convert to L/min. To do that, you will multiply by the subjects weight in kg and divide by 1,000 (to convert mL to L).     You now have L/min, 1 L/min = 5kcals of energy expenditure. So multiply L/min by 5, then multiply by the duration of exercise (in minutes). You now have a general estimation of kcals expended. Keep in mind this is NOT very accurate because peoples fitness levels differ greatly. A more aerobically trained 61kg person will expend much less calories than a sedentary 61kg person. If you would like a more accurate measure you can run a simple submaximal treadmill Bruce/Balke protocol in order to calculate. But if you are just simply using this for personal training, these calculations should suffice. I'll do an example for you just to make sure you got it.    A 61kg person runs on a treadmill at 7 MPH with a 2% incline for 30 minutes.    First convert MPH to m/s = 7x26.8 = 187.6 m/s  VO2 = 0.1(187.6 m/s) + 0.9(187.6)(0.2) + 3.5 = 56.028 mL/kg/min    Convert to L/min = 56.028(61kg) / 1,000 = 3.42 L/min    Calculate Calories. 3.42(5 kcals) = 17.1 kcals/min (30minutes) = 513 kcals total expenditure.    Hope this was what you were looking for, and hopefully I did not overwhelm you.    BTW, you probably already know this but, 3500kcals = 1 pound of Fat and 3.5 ml/kg/min = 1 MET."

In short, its oxidized PUFAs rather than nonoxidized PUFAs Saying it goes rancid in the body is just a fear mongering way of saying that PUFAs get oxidized in the body (rancid, in the context of human biochemistry, is solely a fearmongering term) This is true, because the first stage of synthesizing eicosanoids form the body fucking requires oxidation. Turns out we have antioxidant enzymes in our body to prevent excessive damage People who claim damage despite our antioxidant enzymes are getting caught up in stupid blood biomarkers (oh noes, an increase in MDA, you totes have cancer of the everything) or are citing in vitro data thinking it flawlessly applies to oral supplementation   There are a lot of things you could criticize about fish oil, but oxidation of the PUFA chain is not one of them since we don't ingest 50g fish oil daily while avoiding all other healthy nutrients."

AdvancedFitness,25dejc,AhmedF,30,Mon May 12 17:00:30 2014 UTC,"I posted this in /r/fitness:  Alright, dissecting time. This study has all the potential to be blown out of proportion. It's not a strong design and not able to answer the question it wants to answer.  First - self-reported food intakes are wildly inaccurate. That is old knowledge and unsurprising but research continues to rely on it because it is cheap and fast.  There was no learning period for food logs provided. Subjects start from a low intake compared to the weight, and the research group is ~5kg lighter than the control group but that difference like all the others drowns in the inaccuracy of the data. Notice that the SD of the data points are huge. This means they had a huge variance in the data, making it very hard to seperate real effects from the normal variance of the data set. The between group baseline differences in weight are large enough to be easily the most significant finding, aside from the modified variable of protein intake.  The control group decreased their reported intake, but increased their weight. This is a more profound finding, if true, than the actual intervention group changes. But the reality is, it's juts another symptom of the design. We have random effects all over the place and it all points towards the reporting being the real issue and not the protein.  Training volume is especially variable, with a standard deviation of ALL THE MEAN. This is a key variable to look for as it goes a long way to explain expected lean mass gains. In a study where a part of the results might be lean body mass changes, this is a very serious limiation.  The most damning thing of all, is that the authors discuss their findings as if they are the result of modifying protein intake and not the inaccuracy of the data. They omit all limitations due to design from the discussion chapter, to the extent that it can't possibly be an oversight.  Rating: 0/10, not worth anything.  Study design to answer this question, free of charge:   Measure energy expenditure, have a run-in period of weight maintenance to normalize intake and learn how to log and report. Recruit a sample that is large enough to show significant differences if they are clinically relevant. This requires a power calculation, which was not done in the reported study. Standardize training volume in the run-in period.   These points would go a long way to making a preliminary study, which is all they can hope to do without a metabolic ward study."

AdvancedFitness,25dejc,Layout_Hucks,-3,Mon May 12 18:27:32 2014 UTC,"OK, let's try an example assuming everyone ate 200g carbs and 100g fat, just for easy numbers.  Control group: 200g carbs, 100g fat, 140g protein.  That's 2260 cals a day.  HP group: 200g carbs, 100g fat, 310g protein.  That's 2940 cals a day.  Now, the conclusion was that the 2940 cal group did not gain weight compared to the 2260 group.  We know this cannot be true due to simple thermodynamics.  Even accounting for the large TEF of protein, it is obvious that either the high protein group reduced their carbs and fat, or the control group increased their carbs and fat.  Since the researchers did not directly control for caloric intake, we have no idea what actually happened."
AdvancedFitness,25dejc,lift_heavy_things,3,Mon May 12 18:36:24 2014 UTC,"We know this cannot be true due to simple thermodynamics.    Quote from the provisional paper:  ""This occurred in spite of the fact that they[high protein group] consumed over 800 calories  more per day for eight weeks.""  The 2nd law of thermodynamics is often touted in nutrition discussions but it makes the assumption that the energy that was derived from the carbs and proteins were equal. Or that bodily functions weren't effected from a higher protein intake. Or a number of other things that I'm not thinking of."

The HP group was instructed to consume 4.4 grams of protein per kg body weight daily. They were also instructed to maintain the same training and dietary habits (e.g. maintain the same fat and carbohydrate intake).   This implies they did actually monitor caloric intake.  You may have a particular bone to pick with their methodology, but you're just arguing against the results.  Read the paper, and tell us what's wrong with the methodology."
AdvancedFitness,25dejc,lift_heavy_things,9,Mon May 12 18:57:11 2014 UTC,"It seems they monitored intake, but didn't actually control anything in it.  The statement   The  current investigation found no changes in body weight, fat mass, or fat free mass in the high  protein diet group. This occurred in spite of the fact that they consumed over 800 calories  more per day for eight weeks.   Is somewhat diminished by their later admission that:   Although there was no significant change in the mean value for body weight,  body fat, lean body mass or percent fat, the individual responses were quite varied. This may  be due to the fact that other dietary factors were not controlled (e.g. carbohydrate intake)   So while their findings that body weight didn't change when significant protein was added to the diet, their lack of controls on the other elements of the diet coupled with the small (20 people in the ex group) sample size makes me wonder how reliable these results actually are.  I mean, look at the SD's around the pre/post High Protein group caloric consumption: 2042 ± 838;2835 ± 865."

The standard deviations around their data points are huge - up to 1/3 of the total calorie counts.  A quick run through with the old PEDRO calculator suggests that the bodyweight and bf% categories would look like this if they reported 95% CI's instead of just point-estimates and SD's:  EXP BW pre: 71.8kg EXP BW post: 73.5kg Difference: 1.7kg (-6.21, 9.61)  EXP BF pre: 16.9% EXP BF post: 16.3% Difference:  -0.6% (-5.66, 4.46)  If you believe that this is enough to go on, that's your call.

Glute Marches, Glute Marches for DAYS  I've worked with a few hockey players that have really strong, powerful glutes but are stuck in hip flexion... Although they're glutes are strong, they do not act efficiently as a stabilizer. Pair this with how they stand during their time spent on the ice (hip flexion),  I find the issue comes down to overactive hip flexors combined with anterior core instability.  A glute march will assist in your lower back flexion as, if done properly, will make the glute stabilize instead of only extend.   Cressey also has a great exercise called the ""seated glute march."" Sitting on a box/chair where your feet reach the floor, you ""march"" in this seated position (bringing your knee up, foot of the floor) while maintaining a neutral spine paired with engaged core. From a motor control standpoint, this will help your brain differentiate the difference between lumbar flexion and hip flexion.  Some example exercises that should be practiced are RKC planks and goblet squats (with some pauses if you hate yourself).

What it actually does is cause posterior tilt in the pelvis when you try to get your knee up, limiting the rearward travel of your support foot under full hip extension.  Have you tried the corrective exercises Cressey or Cook suggest? I don't know about Cressey's suggestions, but I've found the Cook ones work reasonably well for restoring hip flexion.

AdvancedFitness,24w4kw,LibertyFive3000,1 point,Tue May 6 23:05:53 2014 UTC,I agree with your description of a posterior pelvic tilt but I think it's wrong to say it can't compromise hip extension. It certainly can. The body is going to minimize the level of hip extension it allows if the antagonist muscles aren't deemed sufficiently strong by the brain. If you're not properly activating your anterior core (like OP said) and hip flexors to stabilize your lumbo-pelvic area you will limit hip extension. In addition to the point stated above.
AdvancedFitness,24w4kw,fuckingkike,1 point,Wed May 7 01:07:07 2014 UTC,"Reciprocal inhibition works pretty much the opposite of that, though, switching off the antagonist when the agonist fires. It's not impossible you're right, but a weak/dysfunctional iliopsoas alone, what those tests check for, shouldn't be enough to cause the sort of problem you describe."
AdvancedFitness,24w4kw,LibertyFive3000,1 point,Wed May 7 01:19:33 2014 UTC,"Reciprocal inhibition isn't as black and white as it is presented in textbooks, unless we're talking about a reflex. You will absolutely have coactivation of both flexors and extensors at any range of a sprint as one transitions from agonist to antagonist they will be switching from primary mover to stabilizer. Total motor unit recruitment will change in each position allowing concentric and eccentric undulation. I would only qualify my statement to point out that it doesn't inherently result from a classically ""weak"" hip flexor as much as a dysfunctional/neurologically compromised hip flexor.   If someone doesn't know how to properly engage their core while sprinting or they have compromised hip flexors that lead to dysfunction, the exercise will become self limiting neurologically."

AdvancedFitness,24inz4,gymbra,5,Fri May 2 04:32:30 2014 UTC,"That's useful for estimating intensity, but it is just a highly generalized formula. The ACSM Guidelines book (does your university use their materials or another organization's?) mentions three major assumptions of submaximal exercise testing. These include that people are mechanically and energetically similar, which is clearly not the case. The book also mentions that the use of METs has many assumptions that underlie it, such as that a given activity (treadmill or cycle ergometry) costs two people the same amount of energy (a highly trained athlete will have a more efficient movement than an untrained person) and that people use the same amount of oxygen at rest. So it should be understood that these metabolic equations are general formulas for estimating energy expenditure. I don't know the actual error, I did a quick article search but I'll look more closely later. We can use them to expect that someone with a certain tested VO2Max will be able to do this amount of work at this intensity, but it's really only a field estimate.  Now, if you're measuring VO2 (as in a VO2Max test) with a metabolic cart, ventilation bags or other spirometry device (or a calorimeter), you've got a pretty accurate measurement of the amount of and type of energy consumed due to the O2 and CO2 levels, both absolute and compared to baseline."

Those studies don't say that anterior core muscles (including pelvic floor - ie levator ani) have no role in lumbosacral pain. They measured lumbar lordosis and pelvic position - it's a big assumption that those directly correlate to pain or dysfunction. The one study looked at gluts and psoas but that is only one part of the picture. I think they also just took static measurements.   Something like 28 muscles have attachment points on the pelvis. I think it is a bit short sited to completely dismiss the role of the pelvis in pain disorders just because of a few limited studies.  It would also take more than one study to convince me that hamstring tightness doesn't affect pelvic tilt or low back pain. If it connects to the ischial tuberosity, how is added tension NOT going to affect the pelvis? Will it present as a change that can be measured with a goiniometer? This study suggests not- but does it rule out compensatory mechanisms in antagonist muscles (to prevent the tilt) that lead to a pain-spasm-pain cycle?    Same goes for psoas major. But I shouldn't have to tell you this, since the authors of the study came to the same conclusion as me. ""Our data indicated that certain muscle impairments could contribute to chronic LBP, but probably not via changing the degree of lumbar lordosis as has been proposed in PCS theory.""  I think you could take Mr. Fass' advice yourself. You can't just find some studies with keywords from a conversation and stretch them to fit your 'truth'.  If nothing else, this highlights the limits to research in this area and the need for more of it."

And speaking to the absurdity of that specific example: it's not even clear that you can isolate the VMO, IIRC.  But that's explicitly not what systems like DNS and PRI teach. I can't speak for /u/aclonedsheep/, but ""weak diaphragm"" is usually a stand-in for ""patient is not breathing with the diaphragm and associated postural muscles, thus burdening accessory breathing muscles"". Those studies only claim to show a correlation, because that kind of reductionist thinking is what journals are comfortable publishing. The author of the first study, Dr. Kolar, is the founder of the Prague school, and would agree with everything you just wrote.  Blowing up a balloon ""with your diaphragm"" in a 90/90 position requires you to engage the diaphragm, let the lats expand the ribcage, relax the psoas, relax the pecs, etc. It's just as much a pattern as a squat or a hip hinge, and I would argue that it's a more important pattern."

On the other hand, if you don't create a brand, it's awfully hard to make any kind of impact beyond your immediate patients. People who aren't academics or D.O.'s don't pay gobs of money to see Dr. Whosit speak  - unless it's Stuart McGill. Academics don't see patients, and there just aren't enough D.O.'s.  But if you talk up your system, enough of the important parts enter the public sphere and suddenly your average trainee might start to become aware of the importance of proper breathing in their training. Not only that, but suddenly someone like me has a relatively straightforward way of finding someone who is likely to be an effective practitioner - just go to the PRI website or the Prague School website and look at the directory.  So I would argue that there is some value to branding. It can definitely be taken overboard, and I've seen that firsthand as well (in the context of performance training, not physical medicine)."

However, having gone through the process of publishing several iterations of my own research (I'm currently a physics PhD candidate), I am not particularly enamored of the current state of academia. It's not that I don't ""believe in"" evidence-based medicine, I just don't think the current system always manages to objectively distinguish effective modalities for any number of reasons.  Then there's the additional issue of funding - my gut feeling is that helping quality of life by improving posture is a much tougher sell than treating cancer, even if it's a rare cancer, and even though I see the makings of orthopedic injuries in half of the people I run into on a daily basis.

I had a training partner who was so fucked, he could barely keep his back pressed into the floor in a 'dead bug' position. Even by having him press his hands into the wall to further engage his core, he could extend his hips maybe 15 degrees before his low back would pop up.  I have a friend who couldn't even press her lower back into the floor with her feet on a wall in the 90/90 position. When I tried to cue diaphragmatic breathing, I verified manually that there was no lateral or posterior expansion of her core.  These weren't people with medical conditions - eventually both of them 'got it', with variations of the balloon exercise.  I'm sure there are yogic techniques for dealing with that kind of thing, but I'm equally sure a casual yoga class isn't going to teach them.

AdvancedFitness,24buit,sharkiteuthis,2,Fri May 2 00:05:16 2014 UTC,"None of that sounds ""so fucked up"" to me. It sounds like normal weakness in sedentary people who have never done strenuous tasks.  Back when my wife was complaining about back problems, I had her work some deadbugs for a while. At first she couldn't do them at all - exactly like you describe. Could never get her back flat. I put a folded towel under her back, had her do deadbugs, trying to smash the towel. Eventually, this worked itself out, and eventually we got to her doing full deadbugs for sets of 10. This was maybe 1-2 months of work.   I'm sure there are yogic techniques for dealing with that kind of thing, but I'm equally sure a casual yoga class isn't going to teach them.   Absolutely they show up in casual yoga classes. Bolster, blocks, straps, and even additional rolled mats are super common to help with weak/inflexible people, exactly like I described above. Here's an example of a lying twist with a huge amount of bolstering.   I guarantee you that anyone who has practiced any kind of physical medicine has seen people like this.   Sure. But I still believe you're just looking at ordinary weakness. It's not different than when someone says ""I can't bench the bar"". You tell them to use DBs. If they can't do that, you regress to pushups, kneeling pushups, shit with bands, etc etc. You keep the same motion, and regress it to work with the weakness. You don't say ""oh you can't bench press? Here suck on this balloon while lifting one arm overhead and holding this soup can in your other hand and blink rapidly"""
AdvancedFitness,24buit,phrakture,2,Fri May 2 00:13:28 2014 UTC,"Then guess I don't understand your objection, then. How is holding a foam roller and a balloon any more ridiculous than dead bugs with a towel or all the bolstering on that lying twist?  It's attempting to accomplish exactly the same thing, just with a different set of tools. It doesn't really matter if it looks ridiculous (which the bolstered lying twist does, BTW). In fact, that yoga pose looks strikingly like some of the breathing exercises I was given when I went to a PRI practitioner.  If I knew how to consistently find yoga instructors of that quality, I would be perfectly happy to endorse yoga for correcting the kind of issues I recommend PRI/DNS for. But those organizations are selective about who they list as practitioners, while yoga classes being taught at some random commercial gym are going to vary wildly - not to mention that its incredibly difficult to do good assessments in group settings.  Sometimes practitioners go overboard with corrective exercises, but sometimes it's completely warranted to severely restrict loading. In my case, I wasn't allowed to press with a barbell for a couple months, did 15 minutes of silly-looking corrective exercises a day, and then completely resolved my shoulder pain, setting several new PRs in the process.  EDIT: I stand by my characterization of someone who can't get their back on the ground in a 90/90 position as 'fucked'. I don't care if that's become standard. People recovering from orthopedic injuries who have all kinds of weird asymmetries are 'really fucked', and that's where systems like PRI or DNS really shine, though they're hardly the only way to proceed in those cases. Ultimately, the quality of the practitioner is what matters, regardless of whatever system they were trained in."

I think that the people who get caught up in an eternal cycle of correctives are the same people who are going to spend months squatting 95/135/whatever to ""work on form"", or worrying about whether they should squat high-bar or low-bar.  It's really difficult to blame the authors you mentioned for wanting to fix, or at least start a discussion about, how badly most people move. Articles like this and this and this are hugely positively contributions to the fitness zeitgeist (I hate that word, sorry for using it). Even articles like this, which lean really heavily towards correctives, aren't about not overhead pressing, they're about how to work towards a good overhead pressing pattern while still getting a training effect. That's infinitely more useful than another ""how I train even though I'm a genetic freak and using gear"" or ""I want to hear myself be hardcore"" or ""how to obsess over nutrient timing"" article. (Sorry for the pile of T-Nation links, but besides the blogs of the authors you mentioned, it's the only only fitness website I follow even semi-regularly, and that's mostly out of habit).  I do think they go overboard on the amount of corrective exercise that's generally necessary. I like Dan John's approach - the basic movement patterns are the correctives, just regress the movement pattern until you can perform it well. You have to squat, but you can't squat with a barbell unless you can show mastery of a goblet squat. You don't get to bench press until you can do good sets of pushups, etc. Based on what you wrote before, it sounds like you generally agree with that.  I don't think a 30 minute dynamic warmup is necessary, but I do think that a 10 (or even 5) minute focused dynamic warmup is infinitely more useful than riding the stationary bike or warming up with the barbell. And there are very few people in this world who wouldn't benefit from spending 2 minutes on breathing drills every time they train, either as part of a warmup or part of their active recovery.  Ultimately, I don't know if that's enough to iron out most of the asymmetries that trainees present with, but I suspect that in most cases it is. Special cases require more focused work. If, like me, you wanted to hit a 700# geared squat, but are shackled to a computer 50+ hours a week, I think it's ultimately more productive to spend the time and money working with someone who practices PRI or DNS or similar."

Position is probably better terminology. PRI uses position to estimate autonomic tone as humans all respond with reflexively driven behaviors thus the patterns so commonly observed in patients. Treatment (any treatment) that influences ANS tone away from SNS dominance toward greater influence of PNS reduces this reflexive ""defensive"" posture and restores the capacity to vary movement .

AdvancedFitness,24buit,Charliek581,1 point,Mon May 5 15:47:40 2014 UTC,"""It's becoming increasingly clear that the path to system variability and pain-free movement is gated by neuroception (i.e. limbic threat appraisal) and autonomic nervous system output. And its these two properties of the nervous system which govern the effects of the innumerable methodologies therapists use to expunge system rigidity.   Autonomous of discipline or method, clinicians intervene at the level of the receptor (rods, otoliths, mechanoreceptors, etc.), engendering unique signal transduction and transmission into a sea of equal status patterns which participate in collective summing within the brain.   We'd hope our therapeutic inputs contribute to a modification in the perceptive capabilities of the patient, though (as we all know) this is not always the case. Some inputs never reach the level of perception while others exceed the adaptive capacity of an already rigid system, perpetuating chronic limbic hijack and sympathetic dominance.  But a positive change in perception opens valuable cortical real estate for neuroplastic remapping via graded exposure, which is the substrate for system variability. This is really the goal of any physical therapy intervention.  So, how do we know we're dealing with a rigid system in the first place? And furthermore, how can we evaluate the efficacy of our inputs with respect to restoring system variability?   Beyond many other ""systems"" I've experimented with, PRI seems to supply the most cogent answers to the above questions. And it's the ""umbrella"" which explains, to me, why other methods work.  What PRI provides is a means to identify a predictable pattern of ANS-mediated anti-gravitational motor output for a collection of systems held in some degree of rigidity. The perspective they bestow is quite comprehensive; PRI is a unified system respective of ALL sensory inputs capable of influencing reticular output (mechanoreception, vision, audition, etc.).   But woven through its complexities, their simple orthopedic testing and treatment algorithms provide a reliable means to assess this aberrant output, as well as evaluate the systemic and perceptual perturbations that might follow any therapeutic intervention (PRI, Mulligan, Maitland, MDT, ART, etc).   Because interventions can be both synergistic or antagonistic to the pattern PRI presents, utilizing a withdrawal A-B-A study design during a treatment session (with the patient functioning as their own control) upholds an element of internal validity beyond what other systems might be able to provide. I'd argue this makes PRI a powerful adjunct to anything you're already doing, as we scrounge for external validity in a increasingly heterogeneous population.  PRI treatment aims to recapture reciprocal and alternating movement in three planes across the three girdles of the body. And PRI is never about fixing posture - it's about restoring system balance, variability, and adaptive potential.  I hope that didn't get too verbose"" - Eric Oetter"

You can develop anterior laxity in the joint capsule and posterior tightness in the capsule, which shifts the humeral head forward and can contribute to impingement, rotator cuff, and labral issues down the road.  If you started playing baseball before you were finished growing, your throwing arm likely deformed to better accommodate throwing, and that's actually totally fine. However, anterior translation of the humeral head is an issue, and if you're starting to have pain or weakness, you should probably see a physical therapist.  A lot of the time, it seems like stretching the posterior capsule allows your humeral head to sit better and resolves issues.

Once you're organized (read: post-breathing stuff) you start to strengthen the ligaments, muscles, etc., surrounding the joint.   The neural foundation coupled with the muscular presence cements proper movement patterns. This is the entire basis of exercise, actually. You're either:  A) making things better or  B) making things worse  I was able to fix myself almost instantly with the breathing stuff. It was kind of amazing. Laying proper movement patterns takes longer but that's par for the course with your body.   I hope this helped"
AdvancedFitness,24ah8b,aclonedsheep,2,Tue Apr 29 22:32:00 2014 UTC,"I'm glad you are passed the hip issue, but this seems like classic pseudoscience. You did absolutely nothing in that period that would benefit the hip besides breathe?  If this has any legitimacy it wouldn't need so much hand waving. I don't mean any offense, it just seems like they served you kool-aid and you drank it. I want to respond so others can see another perspective.    you have to understand that all movement patterns stem from your brain.   Not true, There are too many variables; human body isn't that simple.    You can do ROM exercises until the cows come home but it won't make a lick of difference if you're not organized properly.   It is hard to break any habit yourself, let alone a bad movement pattern. ROM with compensatory movements don't help. Still, breathing isn't some magical cure.   Once you're organized (read: post-breathing stuff) you start to strengthen the ligaments, muscles, etc., surrounding the joint.   First of all, you can't strengthen a ligament. That is part of why you lose stability after an injury. Regardless, strengthening muscles is an important part of the ""Reorganization"". If you are on this subreddit, you should know that the first stage of gains on a strength training regiment is improved neuromuscular faciliation.   Making sure the diaphragm is engaged properly and accessory breathing muscles aren't being used on the regular is important. If there's dysfunction there, it throws off your pelvic floor muscles.  Breathing facilitates the contraction and relaxation of muscles which can help further a stretch. It can also generate a gentle rocking motion that mobilizes a tight area.  It's an important aspect to consider in rehab. My point is that PRI seems to be part of an overall trend in the physical medicine/rehab/fitness world. It is competitive and people want to make money. That leads to taking things that work and mixing them with a ""twist"". Some of the most successful people in this business are the talkers."

Everyone's got an opinion but my hips are a testament to what this shit does. Trust me. It took me a long fucking time to buy into it because it seems so unconventional.   Example: My femur wasn't able able to cross mid-line during the routine PT examination. I did simple breathing techniques and BAM hip passes impinge-free.  Accessory exercises were performed to solidify the movement patterns, obviously. But, the initial symptoms were immediately alleviated.   I'm talking: unable to squat ATG prior to breathing, able to squat ATG post-breathing. No manual work. No stretching. Nothing.   And, why don't you feel all motion stems from the neural connectivity of the brain?  Nerves may fire without direct input but you're buying the wrong textbook if you think your muscles fire independent of your brain.   I never said it was a magical cure. I said it alleviated symptoms but that ROM exercises were needed for follow up work.  I figured I'd get tagged by a pedantic about ligament strengthening. Yeah, it was an oversight. Whatever.   Everyone's mileage is gonna vary with this stuff. I'm just a regular guy that has had a lot of positive experiences with it so far.  Take my advice as you will.   I just wanna pay this stuff forward.

Transiently or currently, hormones such as progesterone, estrogen and testosterone have been implicated as dramatically increased risk in a myriad of cancers.

Here is a link to the primary study in question for those that want it(pay-wall)  Some cool points for others.   A further criterion for inclusion in the study was that participants were at least moderately physically active, exercising for at least 30 min 5 times per week (confirmed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire [IPAQ; (Craig et al., 2003)] and were able to run for 1 h continuously.   So not super athletes, but not untrained.  I think this is a pretty good group to pick from.  I just did a quick scan but I didn't see if people adjusted to this change in diet before testing.  Most people who do something like keto will report 2 weeks of hazyness (just using this as an example of an extreme).  All of a sudden skipping breakfast may not have the same haze as keto, but it is def. going to have an effect. I would expect that any diminshed cognative effect observed in NB E would dimish over time as the participant got used to doing so.   Cool study.  -edit-  One of the referenced material was also really interesting. Can't find the paper here is the pubmed.  Though based on what the author says;   I did however have to realize that this does only work if you really eat and don't just down a protein, let alone whey shake that will only spike your insulin and send you down into the abyss of borderline hypoglycemia. A state which is certainly nothing your cognitive performance can benefit from (Lindgren. 1996).    Extrapolates to much. Assuming a protein shake is in milk there is plenty of carbs there, the paper referenced uses insulin (not whey) to induce hypoglycemia, whey is rich in BCAA which are readily used to generate keto compounds that can enter TCA and gluconeogensis."

Anecdotally, I work out fasted every day and don't have ""breakfast"" until a few hours after working out. I haven't noticed any kind of decline in my cognitive performance - I would say it increases but that may just be due to the workout waking me up. I also find that working out fasted puts me in a great mood for the rest of the day. Still, n=1 in these statements so keep that in mind.    Moving on to analyzing the study.  Quoting the study:   No effects were found prior to consumption of the drink. Post-drink, fasting before exercise increased mental fatigue compared to consuming breakfast before exercise and fasting before rest.   So, working out fasted didn't have any negative effect on cognitive performance or mood (mental fatigue) until after the participants consumed a small amount of chocolate milk. After consumption of that (175 calories, 25g carbs) then cognitive performance and mood declined.  Perhaps consuming something else after exercising fasted would give different results. OP's article states that as well:   It goes without saying that even minor changes in the protocol, e.g. the omission of the 120min rest period (I gather you don't need that long in the bathroom before you either leave the house and go for a jog, sit on your cycle ergometer or drive to the gym), for example could skew the results in a favorable way for the ""non-breakfast condition"", if you don't stick to a meager 250ml of chocolate milk after your workout but indulge a real breakfast...   The study participants' breakfast had 65g of carbs but also 19g of protein and 18g of fat. Maybe the breakfast acted as a buffer inhibiting an insulin spike from the chocolate milk? Perhaps since consuming the chocolate milk caused an onset of mental fatigue in the NB E group (no breakfast, exercise), it could be due to something like this:   An empty stomach might lead to a larger insulin response from the chocolate milk Endurance exercise increases insulin sensitivity (study participants appear to have worked out for ~1 hour(avg) at 60% VO2 max looking at Fig.2 of the article) [1] This insulin would increase the levels of typtophan in your body Typtophan would thus lead to increased levels of serotonin Increased levels of serotonin could cause sleepiness/mental fatigue   Since the B NE (breakfast but no exercise) group and the B E (breakfast and exercise) group both experienced less mental fatigue than the NB E group, the same exercise>insulin sensitivity factor and empty stomach insulin response factor (if it exists) might be the cause(s) of the mental fatigue.  Probably not the best discussion of the article as I've had a few finals today and I'm kind of tired, but just my two cents. If I analyzed anything incorrectly please point it out and rebut me.

Since cortisol is catabolic, this fear makes theoretical sense, but I know of at least one empirical study, which found a positive(!) correlation between the cortisol raise during exercise and muscle hypertrophy, possibly because it indicates intensive training.

Putting that together with the materials you reference, you can see that it is a multifactoral issue.  There have been some suggestions in literature that training be altered during a female athletes menstration.  Suggestions have been that intensity be decreased, as well as less acute loading of knee during the athletes period.  Don't think most coaches, and probably many of the athletes, will be keen on that even if it would decrease injury rates.

Different punches require different technique.  Snapping is faster, follow-through is slower. Snapping will have a chance of breaking skin (if you're rotating your fist on impact like you should) follow through brings your real power.  You'd never follow-through with a jab because it's not a power punch- you should always snap your jabs. 90% of the time (unless you're GSP) jabs are setup punches.  If your throwing a classic combo like a jab, jab, cross, hook, cross, you'd snap all of your punches and follow through with your final cross.  You want to set up your power punches with snappy punches.  Say you catch him with that hook, it's not meant to be a knock out punch but it would give you a split second to come through with a big heavy follow-through cross = KO  EDIT- spelling"
AdvancedFitness,23srpq,Cooper_Jamison,8,Wed Apr 23 21:26:24 2014 UTC,"They're totally different things - but if you want to compare them, the finish of snapping is just following through the precise distance you need to.  Think about it like this - there's obviously an optimal distance to follow through. If you try to follow through 2 feet behind your opponent's head, you'll hit him before you have the chance to generate any real power. If you try to target the precise surface of his face, you might come up a little short and get nowhere.  People who are very new to striking are told to ""follow through"" because most of the time they come up short aiming precisely for the surface. Once you get that concept, you try to ""snap"", or put your body in the perfect extended and rigid position right as you hit the opponent.  Snapping is about conserving energy, staying loose and responsive, and converting rotational momentum to force - while still ending up in the optimal position in a rigid manner to finish a strike. It actually ends up being way more powerful than being tense the entire time, like snapping a whip. It's not precisely the same thing as following through, which is largely a teaching concept for newbies."
AdvancedFitness,23srpq,wotoan,2,Wed Apr 23 21:05:50 2014 UTC,"AFAIK, 'snapping' is just a cue to teach strikers how to punch. You snap your punch to keep your arm loose and whip-like, and fast on the way out as well as on the way back in. It also helps you to encourage the kinetic chaining that's required from your whole body to get a really fast, hard punch.  There is also the speed aspect-- more time in contact with the target means you are exposed for longer.  All other things being equal, a fast punch with follow-through is going to deliver more force than a fast punch with no follow-through. Note the part about 'all other things being equal', which assumes that the speed of the two punches is the same.  btw, you might want to ask some of the more martial subreddits.. ;)   I'm no pro, but I used to punch things six days a week."

More mass behind the Punch (follow through), the greater the force. The greater the acceleration, the greater the force.  But what has been missing is Impulse (Force equals Impulse divided by Time). You can be pushed by a force of millions of Newtons without being harmed if it is slow enough. But if the Impulse is transmitted in a shorter amount of time it causes more damage.  That being said both depend on technique and strength. A strong and quick snapping punch can deal more than a followe through one.

When we teach hitting (spiking). We actually study the difference between ""hitting"" and ""snapping"". We call some positions in vball ""hitters"" (spikers) but that is actually incorrect. We should actually be called ""snappers""  When we hit, thats actually a description of using the shoulder to derive your power from and hit through the ball to generate the pace/power.  But when we snap a ball, its talking about the elbow and wrist joint. Using our arm like whip, rotating the shoulder just directs the whip and then snapping the elbow and wrist joint. Done right, top players can hit a ball in the area of 90 mph..like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNnNK_R1tEg  Using the shoulder at that kind of violent movement for my sport usually leads to shoulder issues at some point in life, but if one is snapping...the shoulder should be fine for years to come."
AdvancedFitness,23srpq,opposite14,1 point,Thu Apr 24 14:30:54 2014 UTC,"I'd say the follow through that originates with your feet is strongest. When you start the rotation from your feet, to your hips, out through your arms you want to go all the way through the motion. Trying to snap back will only abruptly end the technique before it finishes.  Now you may generate more power but you also kind of catch yourself off guard because you put your whole body into it, and at the end of the punch you may be open to get hit. The snap back kind of resets you quickly so you can defend better."
AdvancedFitness,23srpq,nkilian,1 point,Thu Apr 24 18:45:57 2014 UTC,Generally you get taught to punch behind out kick behind where u are actually aiming for because most people subconsciously slow down as they get to the point of assumed contact.  Basically following through is just a way to go around normal mental processes.   Snapping is more for speed with less impetus on maximum power. Still powerful but because less body behind the hit it's usually got less force.
AdvancedFitness,23srpq,fremeer,1 point,Mon Apr 28 02:35:17 2014 UTC,"Late respond, but here it goes anyway.  There are a few things to consider. One is that some instructors are focusing on defense- you want to bring that hand back quickly so you don't get caught.   Another is that Power = Force/Time. Speed is an important part of delivering a powerful blow. I heard one instructor (Muay thai, JKD, probably some others) liken the movement to catching a fly, rather than just a snap.   Snap gives the impression it is just the distal limb delivering the blow. That'll be a weak hit every time. The reason some of the hardest hitting guys aren't the biggest one's is because they can combine whole body movements with speed.   In other words, the answer to your question is both."

AdvancedFitness,23srpq,MRainwater,1 point,Thu Apr 24 01:08:12 2014 UTC,"Well the logical choice is following through is more powerful.   Think of it in many different ways.  a) Force. Any action that happens in a muscle movement requires a production of force. The farther the distance, the more time it takes and therefore the more force needed to move that muscle through the movement.  To put this in weight lifting terms, working through the full ROM is much more difficult than doing half-reps.  b) Acceleration  Snapping requires more control. It requires a shorter punch and then an activation of the antagonist muscle which would slow the punch down. Force is a product of mass X acceleration so 'snapping' the punch would decrease the force due to acceleration.  Think of it this way. One is out of control, one is controlled. So while a snapped punch might be more accurate however a follow-through punch is going to deliver a LOT more force due to both the increase force needed to throw it as well as the lack of deceleration from the 'snapping' motion."

AdvancedFitness,23srpq,broscientologist,0,Wed Apr 23 21:13:00 2014 UTC,"Unsure about which is more powerful (my bets on follow-through) but i'd assume following through would lead one exposed to a greater time than snapping would as well?  If true im sure this could be a factor to consider also.  (not experienced in the realm of fighting btw, so im just adding a guess)"
AdvancedFitness,23srpq,Charliek581,0,Wed Apr 23 20:55:48 2014 UTC,"I used to take martial arts. The way to make a punch more powerful is put your entire body force behind your fist instead of just punching with your arm or upper body. This is nearly impossible to do with snapping the punch back.  So, its not necessarily the 'following through' that makes a punch powerful, but rather an end to the means of making a punch more powerful. If the martial artists who swear by snapping back the punch are competitive, they could like that methods because it makes the punch look more powerful and more impressive."

I am a recreational athlete (6’3”@230) with triathlon focus during the summer and strength training during winter. This year (autumn) I’m doing my first Ultra (50K trail). Yeey! :-)  On to the questions:   In regards to your first Ultra, what do you think you could have done better (in retrospect)? If you were to run a 50K any time soon what would your longest planned training run be?   Any additional words of wisdom regarding the subject gratefully accepted.  Cheers!"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,glamdivitionen,23,Tue Apr 22 13:57:11 2014 UTC,"Hey mate, good luck on your first ultra!    Things I could have done better:  I would have certainly stuck to my strategy- having a realistic goal pacing in mind is a must, but don't fall into the trap I did of thinking that EXCEEDING this pace means you'll end up going faster overall.  You're a bigger runner too, so you realize how hard it is to recover once you've hit the wall.  I would have definitely NOT smiled when I looked at my watch and realized I was 45 seconds per mile faster than I'd planned, and actually stuck to the plan I'd put down months earlier.  Longest training run- I'd honestly say you'd do fine with a back to back- 20/10.  I'm a bigger fan of those since they're less wear and tear on your body, but have the same training effect (i.e., running on tired legs, lower motivation to continue) than straight long runs.  Just make sure your weekly volume is up where it needs to be and STAY HEALTHY.  If you feel your knee tweak during your long runs and think ""Ah, gotta get through this because I need the training""..  DON'T.  You'l regret it later when you lose a month."

On a personal note, thanks for making it at least a bit more acceptable for people to train both endurance and strength.  As for my questions:   What's your stance on programming gym assistance work to supplement endurance form issues (e.g., do you think it's useful to do extra lower back work in the gym to address a runner leaning forward as they tire, or would you mostly deal with that using form work on the track?) Have you noticed any effects on gym work capacity for people who start dual cardio/strength training? The annals of strength sports are filled with ""hard-working farmers"" and the like, and their performance is generally attributed to massive work capacity, but I wonder if similar effects are seen in dual-sport athletes."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,logathion,13,Tue Apr 22 14:31:56 2014 UTC,"I am a huge fan of assistance work for running- additional core stability work and lower back work can help fix a HUGE number of problems that runners often experience.  So yes, absolutely.  Also yes- work capacity is better, pain tolerance is better, and overall motivation is better. They may give up a tiny bit of speed and progress in the lifts, but overall tend to be much more robust athletes and can tolerate much higher volume."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,marcedman,5,Tue Apr 22 17:00:18 2014 UTC,What kind of lower back assistance work would you normally recommend for a situation like this?

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,Charliek581,15,Tue Apr 22 16:54:00 2014 UTC,"I know this is a shitload of questions and a wall of text, feel free to answer only what you want and have patience for.   1) I heard you had a modified version of the westside template for raw lifters, could you share that with us or is it private?   2) What would you consider a good template for a novice powerlifter? I know it depends on the individual, but general rule, what type of frequency, exercise selection, etc would you put him on? Do you agree that the majority of the time should be spent on the big 3? Or doing accessory work would make the progression faster and fix future weak points? If movements are a skill, wouldn't a complete beginner benefit from training them everyday like olympic lifters do?  3) Do you agree that lifters like Chris Hickson, who have a very high speed even at heavy loads, have a greater ratio of IIX fibers, and therefore have a higher potential for strength overall, regardless of their current strength? If yes, wouldn't he lose his potential, the stronger he gets from growth itself (by having more IIA fibers) and not by neural efficiency and motor patterns?  4) What's your take on multivitamins in general?   5) If one managed to make all the vitamins and minerals in proper ratios and doses in a multivitamin, and excluding phytonutrients for the sake of the argument and assuming one is having a good fiber intake, wouldn't a person be completely healthy without eating vegetables and fruits?  6) Do you use auto-regulating often? I know in theory it's better and more dynamic, but if I totally ignore the effort of a particular set, I often perform better. Hard to explain, but here's an example:  400lbs warmup, single (rpe 9)  420lbs warmup, single (rpe 9).  440 working set, double .  If I listening to how the set felt like, I would have stopped at 400 or 420, but I was capable of a lot more, I'd never assume I could have got 440 for a double. Is this individual, or just a flaw in the system that fails to take into account what Broz often said: ""You simply can't listen to your body because it's lying to you"".  7) I know this is a very big and complex topic, but as a general guideline, what do you recommend as protein intake for maximum strength and hypertrophy?  8) Top5 books for training/programming  9) How do you argue with people that keep saying that science is corrupt and every proof you have were manipulated to one's benefit. I feel powerless to change their mind and I don't know how to respond."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,Charliek581,21,Tue Apr 22 15:01:12 2014 UTC,"1)  I do- it has more to do with accessory selection and the focus of dynamic days, though (These become more about plyometrics and hypertrophy rather than traditional speed work).  The overall changes are:  A) more focus on the competition lifts as the main ME lift, B) More focus on heavy doubles and triples, rather than singles, C) more quad focus in the lower body accessory work, D) Less box squatting, E), much less usage of bands and accommodating resistance.  2) I would put him on the same kind of program I'd recommend in the first answer.  If he's working the major competition lifts 1-2 times a week each, that's certainly plenty of skill work (though the loading protocol is different each time), but I think accessory work is still crucial, since a novice lifter may not necessarily be operating in his strongest position in each lift.  i.e., he may squat narrow simply because that's how he's currently strongest, but biomechanically he may be a wide stance squatter.  If all he did was squat, he'd never reach his true potential, because he'd never develop those neglected accessory muscles needed to make him a good squatter.    3) This is a very good question.  My initial response is actually to say I'm not convinced it IS fiber type that makes him explosive, I would argue it could simply be his attachment points and leverages- which vary TREMENDOUSLY between individuals.  A half centimeter difference in muscle attachment point can change torque across across a joint significantly, and I would wager it is this that makes him strong.  This is, of course, just as much conjecture.  :) As for the fiber type alteration due to training making him less explosive...  that's possible- certainly an increase in ""IIa"" (put in quotes because the understanding now is moving towards a fiber type continuum, not discrete types) would result in less overall explosive force potential.  Theoretically, then, he would be less potentially explosive, but I would argue that the contraction speed of individual fiber types contribute less to explosiveness against a heavy load than does overall force production and motor unit recruitment patterns.  i.e., he may not throw a snap front kick as fast (light load, high speed), but his squat would still be ""faster"", since ""speed"" is measured in tenths of a second there, not milliseconds.  And more muscle/more power, recruited quickly, is the major determining factor there.  4) I see no problem with them.  I'd say most people don't need them, but I have nothing against popping a Centrum or Flintstones vitamin (my preference.  srs) just as cheap insurance.  5) I would argue they'd probably be just fine.  Yes, we're learning about all these phytonutrients that can be beneficial, but I've yet to see any that were crucial to survival.  Then again, ""healthy"" is always subjective.  To me, there's a difference between being ""not sick"" and feeling as good as you possibly can feel.  A lot of phytonutrients seem to be potentially protective against many disease states or conditions, so you'd be possibly putting yourself at a disadvantage here.    6) I do if I believe I'm about to miss a lift.  More often, if I know I've had a long week or recovery is compromised, I'll change my goals ahead of time.  Doing the training I do, I've more or less learned I ALWAYS feel like crap going in to the gym.  Exactly what that quote there said- my body is basically telling me to turn right the hell around, go home, and have a beer, which...  tells me it's smarter than I am.  7)  Gah.  Yes.  Big and complex.  I don't want to say something way off base.  Let's just say 2.5g/kg is about as high as I'll ever go under 99% of circumstances.  8) I'd say Supertraining, but NOBODY has read super training.  Science and Practice of Strength Training (Zatsiorsky).  Special strength training (Verkhoshansky), Block periodization (Issurin).  Any biomechanics textbook (Basic Orthopaedic Biomechanics & Mechano-biology by Lippincott).  And check out Brian Carroll's new ebook- REALLY good no BS advice.  9) Science is a process- a methodology, not an entity.  Science is the process of taking ideas, testing them, discarding the bad ones, and keeping the good ones.  It ignores no facts, has no bias, and keeps an open mind.  If they think THAT is corrupt, then they're the ones with issues..."

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,mrbigmuscles,1 point,Tue Apr 22 16:03:15 2014 UTC,Thanks for asking several of the questions I wanted to! :D
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,mrbigmuscles,21,Tue Apr 22 16:24:40 2014 UTC,"Hello Alex,  Thank you for taking the time  My questions are as follows:  1)  In both the JTS article and in an online blog (Chaos & Pain) you mentioned how understanding the body’s energy system(s) is essential for creating a suitable training plan for the hybrid athlete, which also means understanding how the body recovers. Could you please briefly mention these systems you wrote about?  2)  What author or authors can you recommend specifically for hybrid training?   3)  How do you maintain joint health with the added stress of, for example, squats and running?"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,Sport4Life,15,Tue Apr 22 14:31:21 2014 UTC,"Man, I'm a noob for missing this.   1) This was more of a catch all term- by energy systems, I mean everything from glycogen stores (actual energy, depleted by extended intervals or LISS), to mental energy/focus (depleted by max attempts, sprints), structural integrity (muscles, tendons, bones)... basically understanding the discrete cost of each type of workout, but also understanding what systems are less important for each.  For example, maximum effort lifting does NOT require much glycogen (ATP/CP system, primarily, and low overall volume), so a LISS run the day before a heavy squat or bench session will not tax the same systems that are needed for heavy lifting.  2) I have to say...  there really aren't very many.  Lyle McDonald has some useful information, as does Greg Nuckols, but it's truly a fairly young concept.  I would actually check out the Juggernaut method as well- there are some good methods used for football players that tap into those basic ideas of integrated conditioning.  3) There's a reason I'm falling apart.  Really, though, it's all about managing running form.  Squats themselves don't really tax my joints at this point, but running can be horrendous if done incorrectly.  It's REALLY just about being proactive in the case of discomfort- changing shoes regularly, wearing sleeves during squats, and going nuts with the fish oil, which seems to help.  Otherwise, it's like anything else- if done CORRECTLY, technically your joints shouldn't be under much additional stress."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,halodoze,11,Tue Apr 22 22:37:56 2014 UTC,"Hi! A big fan here.  Question: If performance isn't a goal and looking good naked is (no need to actually run other than health benefits), what is your take on slow cardio vs HIIT?  When each is more appropriate?"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,AhmedF,19,Tue Apr 22 14:05:24 2014 UTC,"If the ONLY benefit is health benefit, and the goal is body composition, I'd prefer slow cardio.  The reason for this- it's the resistance training that will build and maintain muscle... i.e. help you look good naked.  cardiovascular training may marginally improve fat burning, but overall I find it a messy tool for body composition purposes.  It introduces a deficit, yes, but is also costly for recovery, is marginally catabolic to muscle tissue, and so forth.    Steady state cardio will maintain most health benefits, but is MUCH easier to recover from and will not, under nearly any circumstance, impact your weight training."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,Tedsting,7,Tue Apr 22 14:45:08 2014 UTC,"Thanks man!  Follow up question: Would HIIT impact all weight training or mainly movements using the same body parts (sprints will impact squats, fast rows will impact back training, etc)?"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,Tedsting,13,Tue Apr 22 15:08:09 2014 UTC,"The latter- the stressors that affect lifting are fairly movement-specific.  Bike sprints won't do a thing to affect your bench, though do keep in mind there's a mentally taxing aspect of HIIT that can eventually start to dull motivation."

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,beritou,14,Tue Apr 22 15:00:54 2014 UTC,"Doesn't make a difference.  I'd prefer non-fasted, simply because I see no benefit in removing any nutrients before activity.

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,Noway123123,11,Tue Apr 22 18:16:12 2014 UTC,"Also, considering that CrossFit is a hybrid sport, what in your opinion are the biggest problems regarding the programming created there?"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,AhmedF,17,Tue Apr 22 14:38:59 2014 UTC,"A lot of CrossFit coaches are changing their way of thinking, particularly when it comes to offseason programming (for the better, I think).  I've generally maintained that CrossFit needs to be treated like a sport.  In the offseason (which EVERY athlete should have), you analyze specific weaknesses and build the fundamentals.  The offseason shouldn't just be WOD WOD WOD, it should be focused on building or maintaining the desired level of strength, improving aerobic capacity, and focusing on skills...  eventually bringing the components together (a la block periodization) as the competition season approaches.    I liken it to, say, football players who do nothing but scrimmage all off season.  Yes, that'll make them better at football, but what they really need is to become faster, stronger, and build their specific football skills before putting it all together again when the season starts.  CrossFit is no different.  Strength training, aerobic training, Olympic Weightlifting skill work, and targeted MetCons are the way to go."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,HonkyTonkHero,3,Tue Apr 22 15:10:49 2014 UTC,"I think there was a discussion on another subreddit here, and people seem to be agreed (even novice crossfitters) that even the winners of the Crossfit games (eg Rich Froning) rely on a classic powerlifting and/or weightlifting regimen with periodization during the off season, and only start to program in endurance a month or so before the Games, which is their season. Do you know enough to confirm or deny that? Is Crossfit gradually moving toward that in its entirety?  Much more understandable than some crossfitters i know who love doing WODS and high intensity stuff 6/7 days of the week, and then also do weightlifting on the seventh. I don't think doing the WOD everyday will allow you to recover fully to get the progress you want."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,HonkyTonkHero,5,Tue Apr 22 16:32:14 2014 UTC,"I sincerely doubt they drop their endurance- I'm nearly 100% certain they continue some base level of conditioning year round, even if they are not specifically ""training"" that system.  I would say, from what I've seen, their programs are not ""true' classic powerlifting/weightlifting programs, especially because their strength levels already exceed what they need to perform at the games.  I'd wager they spend more time at mid level of resistance and still incorporate basic general conditioning.  Just my $0.02.  And yes, I agree!"

My company currently has close to 80 athletes on the roster- I work with other coaches, both staff and consultant, to design their programming and progression.  Generally speaking, I have oversight over all the athletes, particularly the ones involved in true hybrid programming.    2) It does- most folks we train have specific goals in mind which include races, meets, and so forth.  We do all the lead up and prep day of, whether it includes pacing, selecting openers and second attempts, weight cuts/water depletions, carb loads, and so forth.  3) It's my full time gig.

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,Strikerrjones,12,Tue Apr 22 14:21:14 2014 UTC,"For most guys, it's endurance.  Strength is obviously a major factor in winning, but much past a certain level of strength, and it's rarely a game changer.  A lot of fighters are strong guys, but most of them wouldn't really blow away most semi-experienced gym bros in the weight room.  What sets good fighters apart (besides, obviously, skill) is their ability to bring that strength to bear over and over again in spite of fatigue.  Strength training should be very basic, but a good amount of time should be spent building mid-duration cardiovascular endurance.  It should also be specific, since a lot of aerobic/anaerobic adaptations ARE specific to the trained muscle groups.  And a good aerobic base is always key as well, so I'll typically prescribe at least one or two longer duration (30-60 minute) base building aerobic sessions."

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,GreatGonzo,3,Tue Apr 22 17:35:42 2014 UTC,I'll get you both if you train my future babies.

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,AhmedF,15,Wed Apr 23 02:53:07 2014 UTC,"Hey Alex,  I've only heard about you tangentially. The talk is that you're That Guy who lifts a ton and runs really far.  Among lifters, cardio typically takes the form of HIIT, sprints, sled drags, and the like. Do you think this is a mistake? Do you think short-burst cardio is missing benefits of some of the longer form cardio? Do you think it matters?"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,halodoze,12,Tue Apr 22 14:32:43 2014 UTC,"I think it CAN be a mistake.  This kind of cardio does tend to overlap into the same kind of stressors you get from lifting.  What would you rather do the day before squats- sprint and push a prowler, or go for an easy jog?    I think longer duration cardio misses some of the benefits of shorter duration, but has its own.  Both types improve heart stroke volume, mitochondrial density, and so forth, though LISS does a bit less for LA clearance etc.  The best thing to do is both- be judicious in your HIIT and program it in almost as an additional lift.  Be a bit more liberal with your LISS type work- as long as you do it slowly enough, and eat enough afterwards, you can run 20 miles and squat a max the next day."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,halodoze,7,Tue Apr 22 17:32:26 2014 UTC,"Can you define ""slowly enough""? I assume for people just adding LISS this might even be walking, right? How do you determine this?"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,halodoze,12,Tue Apr 22 17:45:41 2014 UTC,"It might indeed- I'd start with simple heart rate analysis- keeping it around 65% of max, and then progress to RPE.  Basically, if it hurts enough that you're not sure you could go indefinitely, then it's too fast."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,FreeCorps,7,Tue Apr 22 19:06:13 2014 UTC,heart rate analysis- keeping it around 65% of max   Excellent. I love finite info. Thanks very much

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,AhmedF,2,Tue Apr 22 17:19:08 2014 UTC,"Can you comment further on when you ran the 4:15 mile and 7:28 1.5? Those are frankly borderline unbelievable times for a person of your build. Did you run them when you were much lighter? Was it on a track? In a competition?  Believe me, I WANT to believe YOU!"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,msharaf7,5,Thu Apr 24 03:03:24 2014 UTC,"Hello!  The 4:15 was...  a few months back I believe, the 7:28 a few weeks ago.  I generally run a pancake flat trail in this area and log all my runs via GPS.  They're not done for competition- though a few folks have mentioned I should give track a shot.  Somebody suggested Master's track, which sounds like a nasty age crack.  What's interesting is if you note the fast dropoff in time there, you can see the plight of larger runners- I can't maintain a sub-5 for more than about 1.5-1.75 miles, and quickly lose my gas much past that.  Something I'm working on- but that's really where you start to see the limitations of size.    At the very least, I'll either be videoing a track run or GoProing an outdoor run later this summer once my ankle's good to go and I'm done with a few events...  I figure there are enough people who'd find it amusing watching a 228 pound dude heaving his mass around.  I just hope nobody sees the amount of drool I produce during those runs.  Cheers!"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,tom_jc,2,Thu Apr 24 04:34:07 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the reply! I think a video of you running a race-effort mile on a track would be amazing to see -- much more so than gopro footage on a trail or something similar.  And if you threw down anything in the remote ballpark of 4:15 -- hell, 5:00 flat would be impressive at your size -- I think you'd have a whole new legion of runner fans.  By the way, yeah, you'd tear up a lot of track meets running a 4:15 mile, and not just ""Master's Track,"" either!"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,glamdivitionen,7,Thu Apr 24 18:22:47 2014 UTC,"Very basic overview of how you would train an elite level amateur boxer for both strength and conditioning? (Fights 3 rounds x 3 mins, 1 min rest inbetween)     So the strength training and the conditioning/endurance training you would generally do for a high level amateur boxer, has 5 years prior strength and conditioning experience.   Thanks"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,grabaka77,15,Tue Apr 22 14:04:34 2014 UTC,"I would give this individual two pure strength days (full body lifting- basic compound movements- Incline bench/jammer extension, hang cleans, deadlifts, front and back squats, then plenty of static and dynamic core work), two days focused on explosive metcons, and three general conditioning workouts.    By explosive metcons, I mean circuits or barbell complexes involving dynamic effort and bodyweight movements, generally constructed into 2 cycles of 10 minutes or so (mirroring the length of an entire bout).  Clap pushups, push presses, floor presses, ring dips, butterfly pull-ups, double unders, pendlay rows...  any movement with a low to marginal skill component that can be done rapidly would be fair game.  For general conditioning- 1-2 sessions aimed purely at developing endurance in the 20-30 minute range (3-4 mile runs, rowing, even swimming), and one sprint/track session focusing on the 1:00-3:00 range."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,marcedman,6,Tue Apr 22 14:42:58 2014 UTC,"Hey Alex, thanks for doing this AMA!  In your Q&A that someone posted on reddit a little while ago, you mentioned you are against Ice Baths for recovery.  During my own research on the subject I found articles both for and against it.  Could you please explain why you don't believe ice baths work?  I'm a big believer in remaining flexible during strength training.  Is there a place for flexibility training(palates, yoga, ect)in your proposed workout schedule, and if so where in your weekly schedule would you incorporate it?  last question, What is your favorite type of beer?  Thanks again"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,marcedman,9,Tue Apr 22 14:47:20 2014 UTC,"Ice baths- my general thought, unless injury is involved, is that restricting bloodflow to the worked extremities is not a good method for speeding recovery.  Simply put, reducing peripheral inflammation for its own sake can slow the healing process, especially since many forms of training are causing quite a bit of damage...  the sooner that nutrients and growth factors can arrive at the target location, the better.  Ice baths may help people FEEL better, since they really do numb the pain and reduce swelling, but I'd rather ache and recover faster than feel nothing but slow the process.  Flexibility, certainly.  Truthfully there's no magic to when this work should or shouldn't be done- the recovery needs after most pilates/yoga sessions are so minor that these can be done on off/active recovery days and not hinder performance.  I would also be comfortable introducing these things after lifting, but NEVER before.  (I would not want anybody lifting heavy weights after loosening up their lower back or shoulders, for example.  Tightness is a good thing in most cases.)  I am a big fan of Belgian strong ales- ""Quads"" are typically my favorite- Rochefort 10, Kasteel Donker, La Trappe quad, St Bernadus Abt. 12, and so forth."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,NomadicAgenda,2,Tue Apr 22 15:20:21 2014 UTC,"Do you have a favorite ""recovery beer""?  I've heard many marathoners enjoy a Guinness after a race."

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,DTRunsThis,4,Tue Apr 22 16:53:22 2014 UTC,"Hello! Does strenght training follows endurance training or opposite in your hybrid training?  Do you increase low intensity traiing during recovery week? How do you deload in your hybrid training?  Any tips for dealing with inflammations in tendons? Besides convention things like RICE, NSAIDs, etc"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,Tedsting,9,Tue Apr 22 13:56:36 2014 UTC,"Depends on the athlete, but usually it's structured so that the higher skill, more explosive activity comes first.  90% of the time this is lifting, but on the few days when I'll schedule both sprints and lifting, the sprints will usually come first.  I generally look at it through the lens of ""what's the desired training effect here""?  If being fatigued either diminishes the training effect or introduces the chance of injury, then this either goes first or goes on its own day.  Tendons- depends on the location- usually I find wrapping the joint or location in a light bandage helps tendon tracking (in most cases).  I find pressure works better than anything else in reducing inflammation, and can usually keep you performing even with fairly major inflammation/irritation"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,Tedsting,1 point,Tue Apr 22 14:37:56 2014 UTC,But how do you compress a shoulder? It's so ... inconvenient :(
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,mychinesesucks,5,Tue Apr 22 18:13:04 2014 UTC,"Ouch, which tendon?"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,TheShredz,6,Tue Apr 22 18:40:58 2014 UTC,"Thanks for doing this with your busy schedule!  Are you and Jamie Lewis both going to compete in the Crucible?  I have very few questions since you seem to go over most of your ideology concerning hybrid training on your website, but how do you plan around or rehab any injuries?   I understand you have a knee problem, and I think I'm dealing with a rotator cuff impingement on my bicep tendon resulting from a lack of pulling (stopped my pullups since my elbow was acting up from heavy squats and pullups, but kept in face pulls and barbell rows)"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,TheShredz,12,Tue Apr 22 14:21:06 2014 UTC,"Jamie might need some convincing.  I would LOVE to compete, but given that I'm going to be selecting the events and designing the scoring, it would be a huge conflict of interest.  I'm creating an event to test everybody, and I'd never want people to think I was just creating something I could win.  Honestly, that's one of the hardest things to deal with but it teaches you a hell of a lot about training.  It's all in finding what similar exercises you can use or rotating modalities.  For instance, my knee problem dictates that I wear wraps to squat at the moment, and runs need to be short but faster paced (to keep me up on my forefoot).  In your case, I'd need a bit more information.  Shoot a note on the web form and maybe we can get somebody in house to give you some ideas.  I'd worry about giving generalized advice here, since the last thing I'd want to do is steer you wrong.  bad advice is infinitely worse than no advice."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,ThreeDayComa,2,Tue Apr 22 14:51:17 2014 UTC,"Of course, I completely understand about not giving advice and wasn't really expecting it. I've rehabbed before, and am using a bench variation that doesn't antagonize my anterior delt and also doing a lot of shoulder/rear delt/RC mobility and strengthening, which is basically along the lines of what you suggested (I think). Just wanted to get a feel of you do for injury recovery and preventing it from getting even worse.  Thanks! Good luck with your knee and the crucible!"

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,Trevor_Kashey,5,Tue Apr 22 18:03:17 2014 UTC,You might also want to consider investing in a SlingShot.  I've had some good luck with that while rehabbing.
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,TxDieselKid,5,Tue Apr 22 18:24:29 2014 UTC,"Hi there!  Long time listener, first time caller. A bit of a specific question, but would hybrid training be feasible for something like soccer, where you need to both have endurance but sprint explosively at times?  I can only imagine more muscle mass to be beneficial in knocking people off the ball, but it'd have to hold up for 90 minutes."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,TxDieselKid,7,Tue Apr 22 14:22:01 2014 UTC,"It is, but it would be an off-season proposition.    As much as I'm in favor of building strength in all athletes, I do always have to remind myself to look at the best and look at their body types- certainly some hip and leg strength is beneficial for soccer, but excess upper body mass just increases your inertia and decreases your agility.  Hybrid training would involve a TREMENDOUS amount of longer duration conditioning work, some shorter duration sprints/interval work, and strength training focused on developing explosive power in the legs.  I wouldn't create a standard hybrid 3-4 times a week lifting schedule for this kind of athlete!"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,Bneale,5,Tue Apr 22 14:57:00 2014 UTC,"Due to life and work schedule, I can only train (powerlifting) at 4:30 a.m. three to 4 days a week. What do you recomend for pre and intra workout nutrition? Thank you."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,trebemot,6,Tue Apr 22 14:37:34 2014 UTC,"Pre:  1) Black coffee 2) A small amount of protein/fat (tablespoon of peanut butter usually does it) 3) If you have dinner later in the evening, within 10 or so hours of this workout, I'd see no need for pre-workout carbs.  If you have dinner earlier than that, I'd take in about 25 grams of carbs (for a 180-200 pound lifter) just to give a bit of a boost.  Intra-workout, I'd focus more on maintaining hydration (always a challenge first thing in the morning) and keeping glucose levels stable.  Pedialyte would be a solid choice here- one container over the course of the workout.  Unless you're lifting for 2-3 hours, your nutrition needs shouldn't be all that major."

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,cameroncrazy90,5,Tue Apr 22 15:31:55 2014 UTC,"Hey Alex, a few questions for you!   If you could only eat one thing for the rest of your life, what would it be? If you could start your journey towards being a hybrid strength/endurance athlete over from scratch, would you do anything differently? How would you program a cardio program meant to get a faster 2 mile time, as opposed to a program designed for long distance endurance?   Thanks for doing this!"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,glamdivitionen,11,Tue Apr 22 14:40:25 2014 UTC,"1) Is beer an answer?  Can beer be an answer?  Honestly, though, clay pot roasted pork tenderloin/sirloin with apple butter glaze.  Nothing can beat it for flavor, you can pull it apart with a fork, and it's almost as lean as chicken breast.  2) Oh dear lord yes.  I made a huge number of mistakes that I'm still paying for now- stress fractures, bone spurs, torn muscles...  I would have paid attention to endurance training the way I did with lifting- rotated the different runs I did (speed work versus LISS, etc.), cut out the endless stupid sub-tempo runs that did nothing for me, picked the correct footwear, etc. etc.  Pretty much take everything I recommend now, do the opposite, and that's how I started.  I would have spent less time doing worthless accessory lifts and focused more on the ones I actually needed, would have spent more time taking care of my knees, I would have eaten more and eaten better....  the list goes on.  3) The LISS component would certainly be shorter.  There are three key runs for a faster two mile-  -the target pace interval.  Sprints, IMO, are fairly useless for this since sprinting teaches you a totally different kind of running.  400-800 meter repeats would be the shortest I would do, totaling to 2.5-3 miles of distance.  -the target distance tempo run.  1.5-2.5 mile tempo runs aimed at getting just a bit faster every week.  -the over distance run- a simple 3-5 mile run at an easy/tempo pace aimed at building overall aerobic base.    The intervals are the most important- I would focus on longer and longer intervals, shorter rest periods in between...  these are what build the ability to tolerate extended suck.  Which is what a 2 mile run is."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,delph,4,Tue Apr 22 15:16:33 2014 UTC,"I think beer is an acceptable answer. That clay pot thing sounds pretty good too, though!  Regarding taking care of your knees - I've never had knee problems before, but is there something preventative I can do, besides maintaining proper running form and using proper shoes?"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,delph,3,Tue Apr 22 15:24:25 2014 UTC,"Those two things will fix 90% of issues.  start out proactively, and you won't get hurt- injuries happen so often to runners because people take running too lightly.  Listen to your body, increase mileage slowly, and if your knees feel beat up, don't hesitate to first take some time off, then consider a shoe switch."

I am 43 and train heavy 3-4 days a week and do 20 minutes of steady state cardio after training.  I feel I should increase the steady state work, but should I do it everyday?  Should I increase the time?  Would it be beneficial to put in sled drags and some sprinting a couple of days a week too?  thanks."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,flictonic,4,Tue Apr 22 15:50:25 2014 UTC,"I'd say the most important thing you can do is slowly increase the challenge- go a minute longer one week (make them 21 minute sessions), then up the pace SLIGHTLY the next week...  go another minute longer the next, etc..  Slowly get your body used to the additional volume, and you'll find it doesn't interfere with your lifting.  I wouldn't go the sled drag/sprinting route.  Sled drags are great and all, but they're no better for your heart than basic cardio and can impact your recovery (from strength training) a bit.  Sprinting- a little better, but a GREAT way to tear a hamstring.  If anything, a day of bike intervals would be a good call right after your leg day."

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,hankNC,9,Tue Apr 22 17:34:54 2014 UTC,"Thanks for stopping by to chat with us, Alex.  I've got a few questions:   Any tips on running slower?  During my recovery runs it's a real struggle to keep to a proper recovery pace, and I feel really ploddy and heavy.  I've just added in some drills to my routine, do I just need to be patient and let those work their magic?  I feel light and quick when I'm going at my own pace or faster. Follow up question, I've recently tried out a recovery spin instead of a run.  Kept things around 80 RPM and HR @ 120.  It felt like what I would expect a recovery workout to be and I'm considering making the switch a permanent one.  Good idea or great idea? Have you got any new webinars planned or new training articles in the works?"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,hip_thrust,8,Tue Apr 22 14:51:08 2014 UTC,"Short strides.  SHORT STRIDES!  Head up, relax your breathing, empty your mind, and think about shuffling.  Let them work their magic.  But remember- your slow may not be very slow!  If you can still lift heavy the next day, you're doing it right.  It's a great idea- I'm a huge fan of using the bike for both intervals and recovery.    Yes- probably producing a new article for JTS in the next week or so, and a webinar in the next month.  Open for topic ideas!"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,Charliek581,2,Tue Apr 22 17:03:43 2014 UTC,Ha.  Shuffling is exactly what I was trying not do.  I'll have to try embracing it.    Athlete case studies could be a good topic.

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,ak_doug,6,Tue Apr 22 20:08:29 2014 UTC,"Hi Alex. Big fan of your stuff.  If you had to train at midday every day, what would your morning/preworkout nutrition look like?"
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,light_weight,5,Tue Apr 22 14:23:57 2014 UTC,"Morning would be a fairly solid breakfast- something steady release with all the basic macros...  protein shake or yogurt, oatmeal with peanut butter...  something to basically get you through the morning without too much drama.  I'd also try to get at least one balanced snack in halfway between breakfast and the workout to keep blood sugar up- 200-300 calories of mixed carbs/protein.    Immediately pre-workout nothing special is needed- black coffee and something moderately carb-y would be more than sufficient.    The real answer here- if you're eating a generally balanced, effective diet and have an effective nutrition plan, then the only objective is to get enough in your system to get through your workout without too much in your stomach- nothing kills a good lift like tasting your last meal after a set of squats."

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,scubasteve42,5,Tue Apr 22 19:06:30 2014 UTC,"Thanks for joining us to do an AMA, Alex! I have two questions I’d like to ask.  First, I have narcolepsy and compete in powerlifting.  From Wikipedia: ""Narcoleptics are not able to experience the amount of restorative deep sleep that healthy people experience""....and we ""live in constant sleep deprivation"". My sleep affects my training and recovery abilities substantially; nights where I get 5 hours of sleep or less aren't uncommon so I feel like I have to constantly pull back on the reins a bit as to not get injured.  Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) also impacts my training as well; fatigue inhibits my ability to train at the intensity & volume parameters I’d like to. 4  Can you give me any recommendations in terms of recovery, fatigue management, and programming? If this outside of the scope of your expertise, I understand.  Second, how would you recommend one optimally structure a concurrent training program if their goals were strength and some endurance? I’ve noticed my work capacity increases when I implement cardio after training but I don’t know how to set up a program like that."
AdvancedFitness,23of8l,dereksimonds,5,Tue Apr 22 14:34:11 2014 UTC,"It certainly is outside my scope.  I do work with a number of individuals who have extraordinarily challenging schedules, though, and quite a few who are VERY sleep deprived, so the only guidance i could give in that case (and what I usually do with them) is divide their programming into multiple short workouts- multiple single- lift workouts a week, where they can go in, squat for thirty minutes, then get out..  and perhaps come back later that evening or the next day for 30-45 minutes of targeted accessory work.  by keeping the bouts of activity shorter, this usually makes it easier for the individual to keep some basic level of intensity.  For the concurrent training- there are a few templates up on the website.  I hate to just give a link, since it's a cop out, but there's a pretty solid strength and endurance template up there for powerlifters.  http://www.completehumanperformance.com/so-you-want-to-run-part-2.html  Look at template number 3 at the bottom- that's probably the best place to start, and you can adjust intensity as you go.  Feel free to email me if you have any questions once you get a framework together!"

AdvancedFitness,23of8l,blakeoligney,7,Tue Apr 22 14:52:22 2014 UTC,"Much more economy oriented, as you put it.  We don't train any pure competitive swimmers, most are either long course triathletes or hybrid athletes using it as an alternative training modality.  For the former, the typical sprint programs aren't as useful (IMO), and for the latter, being smooth and efficient in the water is key, since swims are generally used as low impact, recovery type conditioning.

Recovery may consist of anabolic mechanisms to return to baseline or exceed it, but exercise breaks tissue down. I see this the same way you do. Using muscle provides more of a stimulus to retain muscle than doing nothing. Muscle is metabolically expensive to keep. It uses energy. If you're not moving, your body has no reason to keep excess muscle. If you're moving, you require more muscle than someone who isn't moving.

Yes, sort of. There are a couple of ways to go about this mobilization, and this way is not my favorite. A better way is to push the talus posteriorly and the distal tibia anteriorly as you lunge forward into weightbearing dorsiflexion. It more directly addresses the accessory motion that is often limited in ankle dorsiflexion than the method shown in the article, but is harder to do yourself effectively. Getting the band as low on the ankle as possible is your best bet, then you can use your hands or another band to push the distal tibia forward as you lunge/dorsiflex.

Does the spine adapt to isotonic strengthening, or does it delaminate with herniations, end plate fractures, degeneration, etc?

AdvancedFitness,23br5x,troublesome,1 point,Fri Apr 18 21:46:32 2014 UTC,"huh well. i have a lot of issues with that research article.  firstly, in the context of this thread, the entire ""core"" area is meant to act as a point of transfer of the forces between the upper body and lower body. that's why we train them in an isometric fashion. if we agree with that, then we don't use the core as a means to produce torque. we can further extrapolate that to the fact that we don't use the lumbar extensors to produce torque. in the romanian deadlift, it's the hips that produce this torque. but the testing mechanisms in this study compared an RDL with the lumbar extension machine that requires the lumbar spine to produce torque without contribution from the hips. that could be why they came to that conclusion. if you lift like KK, with a severely rounded back, then i bet that you would see transference to that lumbar extension machine. i think they should have come up with a more ""functional"" test like an isometric hold on a back extension machine. this requires the hips to produce torque.  anyway, this also goes against all the real world evidence. make a person do a long set of RDL's and their lower back lights up like crazy. i've personally improved lower back strength with the RDL. when i was talking about the PPT people above, i give them the RDL exclusively. this strengthens the lower back to pull on the pelvis anteriorly and puts them into a more curved spine.  however, i do find this study interesting that they found no strength transference between the RDL and the machine. there are studies that show that increasing your plank duration carries over to how many crunches you can do. i guess the same isn't for the back of the body."
AdvancedFitness,23br5x,phrakture,1 point,Fri Apr 18 22:10:34 2014 UTC,"I guess the point of this thread is--if you can get a stronger back through isolated lumbar extension/flexion (back extensions, using the reverse hyper like a swing set like Westside et al, etc.) and this will make your back stronger for the reason Pendlay argues (I don't like how he compares training legs to training the low back), and like this research article argues, then why not do that?    And then we ask--why?  A common argument is that powerlifters with big, strong lumbar extensors are at greater risk for back injury.  This suggests that the lumbar erectors are developing as a compensatory mechanism due to the increased demands placed on the lx spine. The ones with less risk had bigger, stronger thoracic and hip extensors (the muscles which should be trained isotonically), and smaller, weaker lumbar extensors.  In fact I really wish I could find the study I am thinking of right now.  Rip argues that it's not functional to train the lumbar  isotonically - because it wasn't designed to do it.  The main lumbar players (erectors and lats) and abs (tva, rec ab, obliques) and pelvic floor muscles are designed to maintain a stiff torso and transfer force through the hips and shoulders--like you are arguing.  Therefore it makes sense that if the back fails under load, isometric endurance is going to be the limiting factor--not your ability to generate force on an isolated lumbar extension/flexion exercise.  The argument Stu uses is that people always hurt their back doing benign things - ie picking up a bag of groceries with less than optimal mechanics, which usually wouldn't be a problem, but after a day of doing hard manual labour/exercise, they've exceeded the capacity of their low back.  His ""strength"" program is also about teaching proper hip hinging and extending from the thorax, and never, ever moving from the lumbar.  Note this does not mean he is exclusively against lumbar movement in a non-strength setting."

AdvancedFitness,236bf7,Crimstone83,3,Thu Apr 17 02:27:56 2014 UTC,"Good question.  I posted this in the discussion in /r/weightroom  ""Just to make sure this is clear - OBVIOUSLY the diet/exercise (or lack thereof) for the people in this study was far from optimal.  The important thing here is the huge shift in RQ (respiratory quotient).  RQ is a measure of what proportion of your energy expenditure is coming from fat vs. non-fat (carbohydrate/protein) metabolism.  In this study, RQ showed a shift away from fat oxidation. That's a big deal, because at rest fat is typically the primary fuel source. If you're burning 2000kcal at rest per day, on average that'll probably be about 1500kcal from fat.  When you shift RQ away from fat metabolism, you may still be burning those same 2000kcals, but you may only be burning 1000kcals of fat. That's essentially a pound of fat loss per week you're giving up (500kcal/day difference, and ~3500kcal per pound of fat).  Theoretically if lifting and increased protein intake was still sufficient to spare all your muscle tissue (unlikely), you'd still be fighting against lower fat oxidation. Those extra 500kcal/day would have to come from amino acids and glycogen.  So, absolute best case scenario here is that fat loss proceeds MUCH slower, and your workouts suck because you're fatigued and glycogen depleted. If you're wondering ""well what if they ate more protein and lifted,"" that's probably the most optimistic outcome."""

I remember the one lifter who pretty much used PSMF on Reddit for 12 weeks and at the end of his fat loss journey, he lost around 1% of LBM. You're always going to have depleted glycogen using a method like PSMF, but the usual 7-14 day recarb days normally get you through your workouts.  Whenever I've been at my leanest or maintained around 10% bodyfat, I've always had to have a high protein diet with careful carbohydrate timing. I know it's known through a few studies that carbohydrate at night isn't really a big deal, but with myself, I'd have to disagree.  Normally if I'm eating to stay lean or get lean, I'll sleep on an empty stomach, and by the time I wake I am starving and normally sweating heavily. If I sleep with a system still processing carbohydrate, not only do I never wake up hungry, I hardly sweat at all."

If you hit 6 reps you go to the next block.  Block 2: 4-6 reps at ~83%, repeat same rules as previous block, just different rep range.  Block 3: 2-4 reps at ~88%, repeat same rules as previous block, just different rep range.  However, it is sort of undulating, because you squat and bench (and deadlift if you like) twice a week, so on the other day you do  Block 1: 4 sets of 7 reps at ~70%  Block 2: 5 sets of 5 at ~75%  Block 3: 8 sets of 3 reps at ~80%  I guess it could be called Flexible Undulating Block Periodization :P"
AdvancedFitness,233khr,noahbdh,3,Tue Apr 15 19:06:00 2014 UTC,"Some more stuff on DUP from Brian Whitacre  Sorry for the formatting, didn't copy paste so well from Brian's website   3.11.2013  Working with a Ph.D. in D.U.P.  For the last several months, I have been working with Dr. Mike Zourdos on my weekly   workout split. I met Dr. Zourdos at Layne Norton's natural bodybuilding camp last year and   was impressed with not only his research on optimal training programs but also the fact that   he practices exactly what he preaches [here is a video of Mike with a competition squat of   over 500 lbs at a bodyweight of 178](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4U8wq6G5js).   Mike is an expert on Daily Undulating Periodization (D.U.P.) which he explains very well   here. Prior to working with Mike, I   trained for over 15 years in a manner that most bodybuilders do: pushing myself to failure (or   close to it) on just about every set. Mike's presentation made me re-think things a bit, and    after experimenting with D.U.P. on my own during my contest prep last year (see my post in   this blog dated 8.14.12), I wanted a bit more guidance and insight.  I don't want to discuss the details of the split out of respect to Mike (he typically charges a   nominal fee to design a program), but suffice it to say that I am squatting 3x per week and   have seen significant increases in strength over just the past 2-3 months. I am no longer   pushing myself to failure on every set, instead working through power / hypertrophy / strength   days for the ""big lifts:"" squat, deadlift, and bench. Each day is still challenging, as the   remaining lifts are structured to push you to perform (the supersets are particularly brutal). I   have not touched a machine during this entire period - the whole system is focused on   compound lifts. After training for 15+ years (and suffering through some extremely tough leg   workouts), I didn't think I would see a sizable jump in my squat after just 2-3 months on the   program...but I did. I have also switched to pulling traditional (vs. sumo) in an attempt to   improve my back thickness. Here is a 545-lb pull before I started working with Dr. Zourdos, and   also a 425-lb squat for which Mike called me out for not going low enough. These were taken   just a few weeks after WNBF Worlds last year. My form on both lifts has improved dramatically.   A few weeks ago I squatted 405 x 7 - all at ""good"" depth.  545 lb Conventional Deadlift (12-14-12)  425 lb Squat - not to depth (12-14-12)  I am not a powerlifter, so I will reserve final judgement on this program until I diet down again. At   this point in my natural bodybuilding ""career"" I certainly don't expect to be adding pounds of muscle   between contests. However, I am proud of the fact that I have continually made improvements to   my physique over time, and hope that this latest change will help me continue that trend. Thanks   Dr. Z for helping me to think outside the box and continue pushing for improvement!"

About 1kg a month. Then i stopped dropping weight and just lean gained. While this is probably not the best way, it's convenient and im sure it's far superior to the bulk/cut strategy.   I still backload carbs and still do a 11-13h fast, but have my calories spread out more.

I've just spent the past 30 mins reading the comments, and Rhonda expands quite a bit additional research based on the questions. Here are some highlights for your reading pleasure.   The point is hyperthermic conditioning, so wet saunas, hot tubs and RIF will probably create similar conditions, but she is referring to dry saunas because that was what the majority of researchers used. There may be a good correlative effect by combining saunas with ice baths, and there is a study which indicates that this protocol causes an increase in norepinephrine, but it doesn't appear to be studied much farther than that. Hot yoga may have similar effects, but the author hasn't found any research on the subject. This protocol causes a significant increase in prolactin, which has been linked to depression in some cases. However, the increase is usually not for more than 2 hours, so the effects may be minimal, but the standard caveats of checking with your doctor apply. This protocol might delay onset of type-I diabetes because it increases GLUT 4 transporters, but the author does not know of any studies supporting this. GH mediated IGF 1 increases lean muscle mass, so this could help with weight loss. Hyperthermic conditioning combined with high-altitude training could be beneficial by causing additional increases in RBC and EPO, or it could cause too much stress on the body and become a net-negative."

""Total volume load (i.e. number of repetitions performed multiplied by the load lifted) was equalized between routines to control for influence of this variable on muscle thickness. Training for both routines consisted of 3 weekly sessions performed on non-consecutive days for 8 weeks."" (1). Ok, seems good. ""HT was a split routine where multiple exercises were performed for a specific muscle group in a session, with only 1 muscle group trained per session""(1) So, one muscle group trained per week. ""ST was a total-body routine where 1 exercise was performed per muscle group in a session, with several major muscle groups trained in each session""(1) And they trained all muscle groups 3x a week. (lifting protocol was also illustrated in table 2, but I can't put that in here).  In both the HT group and ST group showed no statistical differences from each other in improvements after intervention excluding the 1RM bench press (ST group showed significant difference.)  I feel that training each muscle group only once per week in the HT group and 3x a week in the ST group seriously flaws the reliability of this work.  1) Schoenfeld, B., Ratamess, N., Peterson, M., Contreras, B., Tiryaki-Sonmez, G., Alvar, B.

I'm not sure how they calculated the percent increase in strength, but using the formula:  (Mean_2-Mean_1)/Mean_1*100%  does not come close to the percentages claimed in the paper.  From what I see, it looks like there isn't much of a difference in the absolute strength gains (8 vs 11 kg) or percentage strength gains (8.2 vs. 10.6) in bench press between the two groups but the squat is a different story, however the numbers in the table for squats can't possibly be right.  The strength training group manage to increase the mean squat by 38.1 kg in 8 weeks.  That's nearly 85 pounds, and the subjects are supposed to be ""trained"".  That's like something out of an infomercial.  Do 3 exercises 3 times a week and increase your squat by 85 pounds, that's ridiculous.    Also, I question the validity of the subjects being considered ""trained"".  The difference in the initial mean value of 1rm squat and bench press in the strength training group is 4.8 kg.  They couldn't seriously be training legs for an appreciable amount of time with these numbers (keep in mind that group had a mean reported training age of 4.8 years).  The high frequency training group wasn't quite as bad the difference between initial mean squat and bench was 17.4 kg.  and on another note, the formatting of the paper sucks,  Why can't the data tables be inserted into the paper instead of included as an appendix, and why in the appendix can't the titles be attached to the tables and figures?"

I know it has no medical basis or studies to back it up. All I know is that it is exactly what I am experiencing. This is my personal account.  I had started my eating issues when I was about 11/12 years old, I cut calories a little and lost weight (didn't need to lose weight at that point at all). Then had to gain weight because I was a unhealthy weight. By 17 I was mostly a healthy weight. Then at 18 I dropped the weight again because I hated myself. Ended up at 81 lbs and 5'4"" that is NOT OK. Anyway, then I gained weight slowly, over about 2 years up to 120, which is usually my baseline give or take 10lbs.  Then after that up and down period with the eating disorder I have had multiple relapses and recoveries that were not as extreme, or even noticeable, because I never lost an extreme amount of weight, even with even more drastic calorie cuts then the first two.   Until now. 25 years old. I decided to quit this shit about 12 weeks ago.   I increased my calories to a level I NEVER felt was safe, 1600-1800. I work out a lot, I am pretty certain my calorie requirement should really be about 2100 or even more. (according to most calorie calculators, Scooby/ MFP?). Prior I was eating the 800-1200 calorie deal mostly.   So in the last 12 weeks after extreme dieting for most of my life, this is my experience;  Weeks 1-3= Feeling AWESOME, so much energy!  Weeks 4-6= when is my metabolism going to catch up?  Weeks 7-9= feeling like giving up, gaining weight, losing energy...... (didn't give up)  Weeks 10-12= starting to feel stronger, my body is WORKING. I used to not sweat. It sounds really weird but after the restrictive eating I would not sweat, just get a salty film on my body. Now I sweat like a maniac! (I also love it). Got told at boxing 'I punch hard' - as a female, that feels good. Also, my weight seems to be stabilizing. My weight is higher then it has ever been, but I know it is strength and also needed for body functions.   Also this last week was the first week that I felt like my body will eventually even out. Like I will be able to eat a somewhat normal amount and not gain fat mass.    That is just my story. Make of it what you wish."

AdvancedFitness,22404f,coltsarethebest,1 point,Thu Apr 3 21:33:45 2014 UTC,Laxity + stretching = more laxity and instability -> increased chance of injury because structures aren't supporting each other correctly.  The general idea is that we don't have a lot of tools to make loose tissue tighter in the long term. Strengthening stabilizing muscles can only do so much when the joint capsule and/or ligaments are too loose.
AdvancedFitness,22404f,failon,1 point,Fri Apr 4 04:00:25 2014 UTC,"Thanks... This is new to me. So, there basically has to be a medium between moving correctly and not being too loose?   Now I have done a lot of hip mobility over the last year ever since recovering some chronic back pain and some other more minor injuries from playing football. I feel like if I go more than about 2-3 days of lifting and or practice before my hips get really tight and my movement suffers. So if this is the case is stretching/mobility work daily going to cause problems?   Thanks again!"
AdvancedFitness,22404f,coltsarethebest,2,Fri Apr 4 04:18:26 2014 UTC,"Sure, you have to maintain a balance of mobility and stability. What you've got going on probably isn't likely to cause you problems (and there's some good evidence for addressing back pain through hip mobility and strengthening), but of course I haven't evaluated you so I can't say anything definitive about your case.  What the article is talking about is people who are like, ""Hey guys, I can dislocate my shoulder on demand!"" and then proceed to stretch it more, as if it needs it.  There are actually several bad stretches out there, where people think they're stretching a muscle, but most often they're stretching out a joint capsule and screwing themselves over. The doorframe stretch for the pecs comes to mind as a particularly terrible one. I think Cressey has written something on it specifically."

AdvancedFitness,223py1,phrakture,1 point,Thu Apr 3 18:31:22 2014 UTC,"Isn't resisting flexion the same as creating extension? If they're not the same, wouldn't they be trained equally as the downward portion of the lift you're resisting flexion and the upward portion you're creating extension?"
AdvancedFitness,223py1,peaknuckle,1 point,Thu Apr 3 19:37:29 2014 UTC,It would probably be the same if you train resisting flexion at all joint angles. But isometric strength doesn't translate to strength in the full ROM.

Generally I'd have thought enforcing a 80+ Rpm range would be better for this study, allowing lower loading and enhancing the difference between the 'cardio' side and the resistance training thereafter. There's a substantial difference in the cadence of pedalling from grinding out low RPM to spinning out high Rpm."
AdvancedFitness,221x94,AyCarrumba,6,Thu Apr 3 09:44:10 2014 UTC,"There's a substantial difference in the cadence of pedalling from grinding out low RPM to spinning out high Rpm.   As someone who is only a recreational cyclist, can you explain this statement? Do you just mean higher RPMs equates to higher intensity, or is there something about higher RPMs that changes the mechanics of the movement?"
AdvancedFitness,221x94,heavilyarmedclown,12,Thu Apr 3 14:29:47 2014 UTC,"Imagine climbing a slight gradient, on your bike, assuming you have gears. Climbing that incline at a fixed rate needs a certain power output. For any given power, there are two ways to achieve it  - well, many ways, depending on the gears you have available!  Power = Force x RPM  You can use muscular strength and push HARD on the pedals, at low rpm. Or, you can spin at a high Rpm, and use much less force at any given point in the pedal stroke.  This does change the physiology of what you are doing. Very low RPm, high strength work is the functional equivalent of heavy sets of resistance work. It's very fatiguing on the muscles. By asking less of them during each stroke, but having them make more strokes (for the same power output) you lower the anaerobic burden on the muscles and so can stay aerobic, despite you still needing a decent amount of power to climb that hill. The minute you have had to 'stand' on the pedals, you've lost the game! (that really DOES change the mechanics of the movement!).  Any all day cyclist will 'spin' at a pretty high cadence, and they may climb slower than someone brute forcing it, but they will keep going and maintain that high cadence. Look at road cyclists on long climbs - they only get out of the saddle at the absolute peak gradients or sometimes when a kick of acceleration is needed. the rest of the time they will be carefullly metering out their energy, spinning, reducing muscle fatigue and stayng out of the anaerobic zone. The minute you introduce muscle burn, you're suffering, and suffering = lost time.  Less force through the pedals also means less force through the knees, and it promotes a fluid pedalling style where the ankles are active as well, so it's just good form all round to keep your cadence higher than an 'amateur' cyclist might assume. Try and maintain 80-100rpm, your legs will thank you on long rides!"

AdvancedFitness,220uma,mrcosmicna,2,Wed Apr 2 17:50:38 2014 UTC,"I don't really see an issue.  Running however can be particularly taxing on the knees/ankles if you are unadapted to it, your form isn't optimal, or your footwear isn't optimal.  Consider it like lifting - you wouldn't lift with bad form, so why run with bad form. Also consider the turning element in a beep test--maybe not an issue but something to consider.  So as long as you can control those factors you should be fine.   Another thing to consider would be lower impact conditioning modalities such as prowler pushing and sled drags--these are devoid of eccentric contractions, so low likelihood of developing a joint/tendon problem.  There are other ways to condition than beep testing, however if you wish to specifically improve your beep test than do it.  I would also ramp up conditioning, rather than diving into high volume - so start 1-2 times a week, and gradually increase it.  This way you should be able to avoid an overuse injury that plagues most endurance athletes."
AdvancedFitness,220uma,continental-drift,2,Wed Apr 2 22:43:29 2014 UTC,"The beep test is great, however I would switch it up to do the YoYo test if I were you. Especially the YoYo endurance and the YoYo recovery ones. They are slightly different, yet both mean you are running for a longer time than the beep.   Here is the breakdown of the tests. Basically it's like the beep, except you get a ""run off"" after each shuttle. I find it a hell of a lot better to train with and building up my stamina. It also helps that I am tested on it every 3 months so the more I practice at it the better I actually get.

AdvancedFitness,21r071,mrcosmicna,1 point,Mon Mar 31 07:09:27 2014 UTC,"Well, if fatigue is what drives hypertrophy, and more fatigue causes more hypertrophy, then doing more sets would mean more hypertrophy, and drop sets and supersets are basically just more sets done in a time efficient manner.

AdvancedFitness,21r071,mrcosmicna,0,Mon Mar 31 22:23:57 2014 UTC,"Good lord.  The other point I should bring up is that there's obviously a limit to how much hypertrophy you can provoke, and it may be that it doesn't take that much fatigue to reach that point. Also, when you carry on a set for like 3 minutes straight like that, you may just end up using a bunch of fatigue-resistant fibers for most of it that aren't going to hypertrophy much anyway. Gotta give the bigger fibers time to recover and go again."
AdvancedFitness,21r071,Strikerrjones,3,Tue Apr 1 01:35:53 2014 UTC,"Holy cow.  This study says that low load, higher rep training elicits greater myo synthesis than higher load, lower rep.

AdvancedFitness,21r071,skyhimonkey,6,Mon Mar 31 19:59:15 2014 UTC,"Rest intervals are set by the ATP restoration.  ATP is a compound that is active within the first 10 seconds or so of a movement.  This is you're raw power phase I guess you could call it.  ATP has a ""half life"" of 30 seconds.  This means that after 100% depletion, then 30 seconds rest, ATP stores will be back up to 50%.  Rest for another 30 seconds (1 minute total) and it will be at 75%, then 86.5% etc etc.  ATP isn't as needed in hypertrophy as it is in maximal strength training, this is because the intensity and load of the exercise is reduced.  This means that a smaller store or ATP is required to perform the movement.  Where as in 5x5 or 3x3 training, you NEED that longer rest period, otherwise you quite literally don't have enough energy in your body to lift the weight."

Of course, when fatigue sets in in any form (already done some working sets, dehydrated, sleep deprived, etc) your true 1RM isn't the same as your 1RM that you would quote if somebody asked how much you could deadlift.   I think we're all just agreeing with each other and disagreeing on terminology and wording though, the RPE scale is almost undoubtedly better for advanced trainees."
AdvancedFitness,21r071,Strikerrjones,2,Mon Mar 31 00:15:42 2014 UTC,"Eh, I'm still disagreeing with Speedquill's assertion that training for strength necessitates longer rest periods.

AdvancedFitness,21r071,onemessageyo,2,Mon Mar 31 02:51:26 2014 UTC,"I would say that on a single day, your 1RM is a constant. Whether or not you can hit it depends on what else you're doing. 1RM is the maximum load you can complete a rep of if you are perfectly prepared and primed for it."

AdvancedFitness,21r071,frischkaese,3,Sun Mar 30 20:57:11 2014 UTC,"good question. I'll quote Practical Programming:    If strength gains are the primary training objective, rests of greater than one minute are not only okay but necessary. While partial recovery from anaerobic exercise is rapid (50% recovery of ATP/CP stores in 3 to 5 seconds), complete recovery doesn't occur for three to seven minutes  if muscle hypertrophy is the only concern, rests of 45 seconds or less are best. There seems to be a link (although not necessarily a causal relationship) between lactic acid production from resistance exercise, hormonal status, and increases in muscle mass. Between-set rests of about 45 seconds seem to be optimal in maintaining this relationship   Can anybody name a source for the 45seconds for hypertrophy?"

AdvancedFitness,21r071,Ballaticianaire,2,Mon Mar 31 09:29:12 2014 UTC,"The rest periods are just an adjunct to higher reps. You need to really challenge the cellular environment with massive lactate prod and other metabolic stressors to really initiate the full repertoire of signaling cascades and adaption therein. That's where low rest comes into play. Even if you performed the ideal mass rep range (so for sarcoplasmic gain), but used 3-5 min rests/set, there wouldn't be NEARLY the amount of metabolic distress, or challenges to cellular integrity to initiate the myriad transduction cascades"

What they do appear to be essential for however, is functionality of the muscle, and maintaining mass once training has stopped. I could go into much more detail later though as to different stimuli leading to increased proliferation and induction of them."
AdvancedFitness,21oxw3,r3661,1 point,Wed Apr 2 16:21:42 2014 UTC,"There have been studies showing hypertrophy occurring with satellite cell ablation, but the dominant theory is satellite cells are required to maintain the myonuclear domain ratio (sorry, I think I mucked up the name). Essentially a myonuclei can maintain a maximum domain of the muscle fiber, with the size of the domain it can maintain determined by muscle fiber type.  Essentially, the more metabolically active the muscle fiber, the smaller the domain the myonuclei can maintain.  Slow twitch = more metabolically active = smaller myonuclei domain.  I know of no research that can seriously dispute that theory.  In terms of optimally triggering hypertrophy, everyone and their dog ""knows the best way"". Umpteen different things can cause hypertrophy, but knowing what can trigger hypertrophy and knowing how to optimally cause hypertrophy are dramatically different things.  The diversity of stimuli that cause hypertrophy, from stretching to exercising with blood flow exclusion and the diversity of training programs that have created the biggest physiques are dizzying. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Dorian Yates were crazy big (and both used steroids) but their training programs and philosophies couldn't have been more different.  Anyone who says that they know the best way to stimulate hypertrophy are entitled to their opinion, I couldn't say they were wrong (unless they're out to lunch). I have ideas, but couldn't prove that mine were significantly better than any others.   End rant."
AdvancedFitness,21oxw3,Ballaticianaire,1 point,Thu Apr 10 01:35:33 2014 UTC,"I already touched on that point with ""functionality of the muscle"". That's where the myonuclear domains come in, whereby smaller myonuclei w/ larger domains lead to dysfunctional muscles (yet still very large) in comparison to smaller domains controlled by more myonuclei.  And yes, no one knows the best way due to genetic discrepancy most likely.. however, it is quite certain that if your main goal is mass and optimizing hypertrophy, anything under 10 reps is going to be far counterproductive due to the necessity of massive lactate and metabolite production to cause all the myriad transduction pathways for adaptation and growth."

You can't target sarcoplasmic hypertrophy independently from myofibrillar hypertrophy with certain rep ranges like broscience claims.  Fisher et al used the term in a way that I don't completely hate in their recent review though, to basically describe the temporary increase in sarcoplasm that lasts for a few days after training. I think Brad Schoenfeld has mentioned this as well, although he refers to it as the pump, not as sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.

AdvancedFitness,21jzo1,Strikerrjones,12,Fri Mar 28 00:48:40 2014 UTC,"The basic premise presented in the paper is:  -Measurements of muscle fractional synthesis rate are limited because they do not measure breakdown and thus only provide half the information required to analyse the anabolic response. Further, as the gut acts as a temporary storage/buffer to take up large amounts of dietary protein during mealtime and then releasing them into the blood gradually, this part of the anabolic response is lost.  -net anabolism may continue without further increases in synthesis  -Protein alone doesn't stimulate enough insulin to maximally stimulate anabolism, and this results in under-estimates during most protein feeding studies, as opposed to whole meal studies  -According to their theory, there is a linear relationship between ingested protein in a whole-meal and the anabolic response, without a predicted practical upper limit  My take on this:   As an opinion paper, it is not subject to systematically assessing the evidence. It represents expert opinion on this, and the expertise of the authors appear to lie primarily within geriatrics and sarcopenia rather than bodybuilding.   They present data that there is not practical upper limit, based on studies which had the highest intake at roughly 2g/kg bw, but many of the studies cited do not exceed the proposed ""maximum intake"" they critique.  They propose a linear relationship with no practical upper limit, the word practical in this context allows them some gray area. In the context of a meal, there are perhaps limitations on the intake based on what people like. This ignores the possibility that a bodybuilder reads this and proceeds to eat meals with 400g protein and 1200g carbs, fighting nausea and expecting the linear relationship to hold.  I would consider this evidence in the context of the research. Which is, for elderly people especially 3g/kg FFM (~2g/kg BW in the population) is a good intake to minimize muscle wasting.  It is likely that the theory holds in younger populations as well, but as catabolism is much less pronounced in the younger people the maximum anabolism is likely reached at much lower intakes."

Does it mean something like this:  increasing protein intake at a meal decreases the rate of protein breakdown, so while synthesis plateau, breakdown can further decrease.  So, you have a net increase.    And even though breakdown can bottom out at zero, it's not practical for a person to eat that way?"

Yeah, they propose that the ceiling of anabolism - if it exists - is high enough that it's unlikely to be relevant.  I'd like to re-state that the study population was the elderly, who have a much higher catabolism to begin with (and hence why they study this) and so probably need more protein to get catabolism to zero, than do healthy young people."

In the authors' defense, it's possible that the studies they reviewed did show that.  This highlights a flaw of a review--you can't include every study.   However, protein breakdown has not been taken into account when evaluating the anabolic response to protein intake.   I'm pretty sure Dr. Layne Norton and Dr. Jake Wilson have studied that.  Although I might be remembering them discussing someone else's research.  Either way, it has been done.  I'd also like to know are who the subjects are (average Joes? athletes?  what kind of training background?) and how strong the correlation between the muscle anabolism/catabolism ratio and muscle growth or performance is.

My lay man conclusion after reading the paper is that the most important thing is to reach your daily protein goal to ensure not only maximal MPS but also minimize breakdown (which the paper discusses is not usually examined in the ""more than 30g of protein per meal does not further elevate MPS"" studies). However, I also think that spreading out your protein meals would be beneficial to get the most out of the MPS stimulating effects. E.g. if you have a protein requirement of 200g, then spreading across 4x50g meals per day might be superior to eating 3x67g."

Most education on the subject is a meta-analysis of how metabolism and synthesis works.  Starting with protein quality, digestion, absorption, appearance, transport, uptake, synthesis, excretion.  If you don't get a decent background on how these things work in a variety of situations you can't appreciate or project onto the apparently healthy individual and their actual AA needs.    That being said, you missed the key points if you breezed through and only looked at the research hypotheses.  Often, before a pitch or design is introduced, there has to be a spark of interest found in someone elses research in order to light the bulb above another's head.  The key point to consider here is that the immediate bolus either before, during or after exercise is less important than the availability of the AA pool over the course of the day thus suggesting that it isn't advisable to ingest a large bolus post-exercise but to keep your g/kg allowance spread throughout the day to avoid moments of negative nitrogen balance."
AdvancedFitness,21jzo1,Monkar,1 point,Sat Mar 29 19:50:25 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I understand what you're trying to say, but I still have yet to see conclusive (or even suggestive) evidence that any amount of protein at one time is ""too much"", from previous reading as well as anything pointed out in this discussion.  If your daily protein requirement is 200g, split that between 4 meals (one every 3 hours say), then you necessarily have to be consuming 50g or more at least once or twice a day.  You could get around this by eating more frequent, smaller meals, but even if you double it and go with 8 ""meals"" in a day they're going to be so close together that there's no way you will have digested all 25g of protein by the next time you eat.  If you have evidence to the contrary I'd love to see it, as I usually have a protein shake at night that's ~50g all at once and if I'm wasting Whey powder I'd certainly like to re-think my approach.  I certainly haven't ever seen anything convincing enough to make me stop though, at least up to this point."
AdvancedFitness,21jzo1,Furthur,1 point,Sat Mar 29 20:06:11 2014 UTC,"I was thinking the last two links I posted for you were enough to demonstrate that.  in order to need 200g/day you have to be a 110kg person, the emphasis on what I've been trying to get across is the immediate post-exercise dosing strategy, if you can find evidence of a >2g/kg pro-requirement I'll gladly check it out.   This is one more reason why we, as exercise scientists, suggest a more intermediate nutrition prescription instead of breakfast/lunch/dinner.  Have a look at some of the high protein content foods that are very small dose and easy to eat here and there over the course of the day.  Cottage cheese, yogurt, canned tuna, kidney beans etc.. are all easily packed and eaten in quantities that keep your pro:volume ratio high yet don't fill you up or cause drastic insulin spikes pre-exercise when you don't want them.  You're nearly always wasting whey powder if you consume it like that and most certainly not getting all the benefits of it if it is low/no carbohydrate, insulin is your friend post-workout and pro alone isn't going to maximize uptake like the addition of CHO does in combination with PRO.    The last post I replied to evaluated the differences between dosage amounts post-exercise and 40g was no different than 20 (0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 g egg protein, which is the protein all others are compared to for completeness).  from that paper:   Our study is the first to our knowledge to describe the responses of mixed-muscle and albumin protein synthesis as well as whole-body leucine oxidation to increasing protein intake after an acute bout of resistance exercise. We report that increasing protein intake stimulates mixed-muscle and plasma albumin protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner up to 20 g dietary protein, after which there is a marked stimulation of whole-body leucine oxidation and no further increase in protein synthesis. The stimulation of muscle protein synthesis with increasing protein intake was not associated with any consistent change in the phosphorylation status of candidate signaling proteins."
AdvancedFitness,21jzo1,Monkar,1 point,Sat Mar 29 20:36:40 2014 UTC,"The last post I replied to evaluated the differences between dosage amounts post-exercise and 40g was no different than 20   For the very specific thing they were looking for, which was immediate post-exercise MPS.  That's not to say that there isn't still some benefit to a higher dosage, such as a longer elevation of MPS or some other untested factor.  It's also related to the already somewhat commonly discussed topic of protein timing (discussion in this sub about that recently), which is also still a somewhat debatable topic depending on which papers you read.  Just for some supporting information from the side I'm arguing for which is that acute dosage doesn't matter, check out this write-up by Layne Norton (emphasis mine):  It appears that maximizing skeletal muscle protein synthesis requires approximately ~15g of an essential amino acids1,2. It has been postulated that the amino acid leucine is responsible for the stimulatory effect of dietary protein on protein synthesis3 and 15g of essential amino acids would contain 3.2g of leucine. [...] For example, whey protein is approximately 12% leucine per gram protein, therefore about 27g of protein from whey would need to be consumed to reach the threshold for maximal anabolism [...] It is important to note that most of these studies were done on individuals who weighed approximately 155-165 lbs on average. So if you weigh less than this you might want to aim for the lower end of the threshold whereas if you weigh more you may want to aim for the higher end of the threshold. [...] It is unlikely that eating another meal 2-3 hours after the first meal would be sufficient to induce another rise in protein synthesis since amino acid/leucine levels are already elevated anyway. It may therefore be more useful to consume larger amounts of protein at a meal and wait longer between protein doses than the typical 2-3 hours that is typically recommended in the bodybuilding community. [...] I therefore suggest that one consume 4-6 larger protein doses per day instead of 6-8 meals and wait 4-5 hours between meals rather than 2-3 hours.Link  Which goes back to exactly what I said, if you have to split your entire protein consumption between 4 meals and you require 200g a day. . .  **Edit to say I stole that Layne Norton link / quote from here"
AdvancedFitness,21jzo1,Furthur,1 point,Sat Mar 29 21:55:17 2014 UTC,"longer elevation of MPS is targeting the insulin window (~4 hours), the suggestions for post-exercise glycogen depleting events to maximize glycogen resynthesis and amino acid uptake is a 4-3:1 ratio of CHO to PRO per hour, thusly the hours post exercise can support a 120g 4 hour period.  You run into the issue of digestion and passing of the nutrient rich substrate if you cram a bolus that is too large at once you end up passing it and not keeping the AA's topped off.  Here is the discussion on the Wolfe paper he referenced  the problem, as you seem to be hanging on, is that sport nutrition isn't easy. If you want to do it right, 4 evenly spaced meals doesn't cut it, unless it's in recovery after a bout of exercise in the hours after.  If we believe that the anabolic window is 45-60min post stimulus yet the potential for AA uptake lasts as long as the insulin window keeps sucking up AA/CHO.  Also remember that there are thresholds for your stomach to pass these foods into your small intestine to begin with, if you dump too much or screw up the macro split you significantly delay the rate of gastric emptying and nearly all of the enzyme digestion happens in the small intestine so if it doesn't get there it doesn't get circulated.  the reccs for BCAA or EAAs are typically 10-15% makeup, not necessarily a g/kg as EAA isolates are just fancy costly powders when an egg or two will do the trick. So yeah, his acknowledgment of the suggestions of AA dosing are what we typically see in the literature, it just doesn't do any good to have that massive dose of AA and ride a roller coaster of +/- nitrogen balance between meals.   As far as mass goes, here  and a potato cam pic of the reference graph  This graph demonstrates the lack of relationship between N balance at intakes greater than the RDA in these subjects, hence that N balance doesn't correlate with higher protein intakes of 200g for anyone who isn't 110kg is overkill and wasteful."

AdvancedFitness,21ick1,stratius,3,Thu Mar 27 18:32:28 2014 UTC,"Actually yeah, that would be good. With a singlet you could also add weight around your hips so the weight would be at your center of gravity.  The vest I use is 15 pounds, and is totally awkward because it makes me feel top heavy, it bounces around when I run (because it isn't very tight) and any time I'm upside-down it shifts up and is way uncomfortable."

Make sure you follow the book to the letter, and do the testing before you continue reading. That's very important. You need to increase your 1rm squat to at least 2x bodyweight as well.  I doubt you will consider this, but it's my area of expertise: there are drugs that can help with explosiveness.

AdvancedFitness,217qdc,kilimanjaro13,2,Mon Mar 24 17:27:39 2014 UTC,"Well, any time you increase your strength while maintaining or reducing your body weight your ""explosiveness"" should increase because your strength:weight ratio increases. It doesn't always work though. Many steroids could be used for that purpose. Only ones like anadrol, dbol, and test that produce a relatively high amount of water weight would be inefficient for that purpose.   Things like clen, t4, powerful androgens, stimulants, pgf2a, can all be used to help increase power in different ways. Some will increase the proliferation of type 2 muscle fibers, and others will increase the efficiency or power of the cns."

AdvancedFitness,217qdc,kilimanjaro13,0,Mon Mar 24 17:43:44 2014 UTC,You need to increase your 1rm squat to at least 2x bodyweight as well.   That's absolutely ridiculous.
AdvancedFitness,217qdc,Good_Guy_Ian,2,Wed Mar 26 13:17:15 2014 UTC,How so? Many vertical jump experts recommend that. They say that's the amount of squat strength after which one sees diminished carryover to the vertical jump.
AdvancedFitness,217qdc,nuzebe,1 point,Wed Mar 26 14:26:19 2014 UTC,"Well there are a lot of issues within the statement, but mainly that it implies a direct and necessary correlation between squat strength and leaping ability - as in, you can't dunk if you can't squat 2xBW, which obviously isn't true. Sure, squatting will increase vertical in an untrained athlete (with as you said, diminishing marginal effects). But they're two completely different physical movements and mechanisms, both integrated into a pretty elegant system. Jumping is jumping, squatting is squatting, and there are an awful lot of average-height people in the world who can dunk, but who'd crumble beneath a 2xBW barbell."
AdvancedFitness,217qdc,RyGuy_,1 point,Wed Mar 26 15:47:16 2014 UTC,"I didn't imply that, you read into it. I mentioned a jump training resource and then said squatting 2x bodyweight is advisable as well. And squatting will increase the vertical of almost any athlete that can not squat 2x bodyweight. The movements have a lot of overlap. And I don't think there are a lot of 5'9"" Americans who can dunk, and those who can are likely well-trained athletes who can squat close to 2x bodyweight."

AdvancedFitness,217qdc,RyGuy_,3,Wed Mar 26 19:27:07 2014 UTC,"I'm sure you've gotten sick of hearing this, but there's a very good possibility that you will never dunk.  You have a long way to go and your age isn't going to help any.  That is not me telling you not to try, if anything use that as motivation.  If you are really committed to it though, you need to change what you are doing because that routine will never get you there.  You need to do a lot more explosive lower body exercises.   Heavy kettle bell swings: Good, continue these. All Ab exercises: Good, add more. Deadlifts: Good, cut out the shrugs. Bench Press: Good, you need to stay balanced.   Things you should really consider adding: - Power Cleans: Full-body exercise that is nothing but explosive power.       This will directly influence your vertical jump. - Jump Squats: Please use very light weight.  Far too many people try to go heavy on this. - Walking Lunges (This video is great, but I would add the note I placed below after you have become comfortable with the exercise): Gives you a big booty and the vertical increase that goes with it. - Box Jumps: Try with a weighted vest.  *When doing the walking lunges its important to go from one immediately into the next.  Also, reach your knee up when stepping out as in pretend there is a string from the ceiling to your knee and every time you go to step out it pulls your knee up to the level of your waist."

AdvancedFitness,217qdc,DesertDrummer,1 point,Wed Mar 26 05:50:32 2014 UTC,"No problem man!  I'm glad I could help.    Light for jump squats is going to depend on your abilities.  Light for me would be 135lbs, but I can max 400lbs on squat.  You have to find a weight that you feel comfortable throwing around a bit.  As for what day, you should do (IMO) one heavy day and one light day each week for each muscle group.  How you group them is honestly personal preference.  I see good results with push/pull from highschool athletes as well as grouping as follows: - chest/shoulders/triceps -legs/back/biceps The second form is what I do personally and is my favorite out of everything I have tried."

Since you're doing two-a-day sessions, is the morning one harder and the afternoon one a less intense recovery pace? Or is this an especially intense week designed to tear you apart before you taper down later? It's hard to imagine that it will be possible to do weight sessions with much intensity since there isn't a lot of recovery built in. Since this is Div 1, doesn't your school have an accompanying recovery program like massage and ice immersion? Given that spring break is typically associated with partying and lack of sleep, you're going to have to ignore all that and do nothing but eat and sleep when you're not training."

AdvancedFitness,216swq,SpeedQuills,5,Mon Mar 24 02:08:33 2014 UTC,"Smaller feet will allow you to be faster and more agile.  Your feet absorb tremendous forces during sprinting.  The longer your foot, the longer the lever. More torque and a greater moment arm means more force has to be applied eccentrically by the musculature of the foot and calf to reverse dorsiflexion. All things equal, more force equals more time.  Since much of the sprint action at the foot revolves around stored elastic energy in tendons, more eccentric reversal time means more elastic energy dissipates (because it is time dependent) and thus less elastic energy harnessed.   Additionally, a larger foot is a heavier foot. All things being equal, it will decreases stride turnover rate because it will take more force to move the heavier foot during recovery."

AdvancedFitness,216swq,SetsOnTheBeach,3,Mon Mar 24 02:31:37 2014 UTC,"Long legs have to travel a longer distance. In some cases its negligable, in others it can make noticeable differences. Long legs in a sprint are good cause longer stride. Long legs in a squat mean a greater distance travelled than shorter legs so it makes it a little harder. Thats why the best sprinters are generally taller, and the best squatters are generally shorter.  Agility is more in the legs and hips. Foot placement is all that matters with the foot. And the size of the foot doesnt really affect that much.I wear a 13 and unless you tackle me, im hard to trip up. I rarely, like never, trip or fall down. I always catch myself. Ive seen smaller guys( i assume smaller foot) that are like damn monkeys in a tree, agile as shit.   Agility is more about keeping your center of gravity flexible and thinking quick, not so much muscle strength or size. Muscle strength can help tho. A taller person would have a higher center of gravity so theyd be more prone to clumsiness, or tripping up, but it can be tamed. It can become a negligable difference.... unless youre like 6'10"" then I dunno. No idea about those heights."

What I mean by this is that after progressing on a lift, there have been times where I may have developed poor habits or forgotten about certain cues. I usually re read material and watch videos or even speak to experienced folks to discuss the lifts. On that active recovery day with just the barbell focus on certain cues and practice particular movements. By doing this, it helps me reinforce good habits while weeding out the bad ones. I like to think of it as re-caliberating. Then I will just go through the motions many times to get the motor patterns correct, breathing cues, proper depth, foot placement, etc., There is always something to improve and I have found it very beneficial as I have learned more about how my body works and how I can react to certain cues depending on the situation."

He doesn't talk about stroke volume changes or VO2 changes that would denote CV improvements.  That being said, I think that ST does have some cardiac and vascular benefits, as well as some bio marker benefits.  I think it should be as much a part of a healthy fitness plan as cardio and flexibility.  I would say that those looking for CV health benefits, but don't want to make a large investment, should do higher intensity, but short duration (85 - 90% maxHR, 15 to 20 mins of duration) of 3 x per week would do (in addition to ST).

AdvancedFitness,212nzx,Strikerrjones,2,Sat Mar 22 20:44:21 2014 UTC,What about this paper?
AdvancedFitness,212nzx,AnotherGoonFullback,6,Sat Mar 22 22:49:36 2014 UTC,"Thanks for linking this paper, it is interesting.  To address your question, and in reference to the OP's...  There is a very good attempt to solve the problem here.  I don't think it is a bad paper, and it is a great start in discovering the answer to this issue.  That being said, there are some flaws.  And for the question the OP is asking, this doesn't quite answer it because the intensity isnt the same between the complexes and the max voluntary failure used in the paper.  Having said that, I would like to discuss the paper because it has some good points, though it has flaws. So...  First, meta analysis is tricky business.  As the authors themselves state, the studies that they looked at have flaws.  Now matter how good the attempt at analysis, if what you use for the meta is flawed, you can only reach weaker conclusion.  And from this, I think the authors stretched a bit far.  I think there are some really good bits in it, despite the problems.  Second, because the authors never did their own comparisons, they are extrapolating.  The danger of extrapolating in a meta is that there can be significant statistical confounds.  Third, they need to have a direct comparison between maximum voluntary failure RT and CV training and all there listed markers of CV improvements.  They don't, they are extrapolating from possibly flawed data (which they themselves admit about the very studies they used).  Fourth, why did these authors not do that research themselves.  If they saw the flaws and thought they knew the way to correct for it, do it!  Stop relying on others work and do it yourself.  This frustrates me with some researchers.  Meta is a necessary technique for analyzing data, because sometimes what you are trying to do is impossible otherwise; but here, they could have taken the path of direct research.  So, yes it is an interesting paper, with some interesting extrapolations.  It is a great jumping off point for further research that needs to be done.  But it makes predictions with out solid enough evidence.  I hope that the researcher or there grad assistants go off and actually do the studies that show direct evidence.  This shows great cause to believe that very high intensity, specifically max voluntary failure RT, may improve cardiac function.  What needs to happen now is research to show direct evidence.  I hope someone does it and helps to put this question to bed."

AdvancedFitness,20pb09,big_face_killah,8,Tue Mar 18 14:11:57 2014 UTC,"Well, it's closer to ""You'll probably get injured"" for beginners. I think that's the biggest issue with Crossfit-style exercise becoming so popular, anyone thinks they can just jump into it. They can't. The bigger issue to me is first-timers jumping into Crossfit may get injured, and then get turned off to exercise in general."
AdvancedFitness,20pb09,fezzisfezz,2,Tue Mar 18 18:12:24 2014 UTC,"I feel like every time Crossfit gets brought up in this sub someone has to explain how it is too dangerous.    I did Crossfit daily for 7 months strait and didn't get injured.  I played in 1 post season Rugby match this winter and broke my hand, while it had been years since I played 2 other guys went to the hospital (1 stitches, 1 other broken bone) in he same match and they had played and practiced all season.  So comparatively, I would say Crossfit isn't really that dangerous.    Does anyone who lurks in this sub really not have the knowledge to conduct or participate in Crossfit safely?    Okay, feel free to downvote me now."
AdvancedFitness,20pb09,finitedesign,6,Wed Mar 19 04:52:08 2014 UTC,"Comparing the risk of a contact sport with a routine workout probably isn't the most relevant choice.  The point is that high intensity and high impact routines carry more risk of injury than lower impact alternatives, especially for the unseasoned. Those risks are greatly mitigated by experience; building up the intensity in a way that allows your body to adapt and being aware of your limits. Someone with years of athletic experience or under qualified supervision would likely have relatively little additional risk. Someone who got C's in gym class, never played sports, and who hasn't ever been consistently active, let alone athletic, not so much.  I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that Crossfit and the like are not the ideal choice for someone's first experience, at least without a qualified trainer guiding them through it."

The point of my post was to postulated the question: why are the people who comment in this sub so obsessed with what is the safest and best thing for absolute beginners?  If you are an absolute beginner, why would you lurk in a sub called advanced fitness?  Why do we have to suggest how dangerous it is for the uninitiated every time it is mentioned?    I don't think it is an unreasonable question, I can copy this from the sidebar    Primarily aimed at non-beginners, though all are welcome.   Without even having to scroll.  The fact that it can be dangerous to people who live sedentary lifestyles doesn't really add any knowledge for those of us who are not beginners (although I wouldn't consider myself an expert either) yet it is almost exclusively the only thing that gets mentioned about crossfit when the topic comes up."
AdvancedFitness,20pb09,finitedesign,3,Wed Mar 19 22:04:45 2014 UTC,"I'm guessing that many of the people here either work with beginners professionally or know plenty, be they friends or family. Others probably have an interest in public health or rehabilitation. That HIIT training can carry a higher risk without proper care and precaution is still relevant to experienced athletes, especially when backed up with some data, even if it might something they should already know.  The post being discussed is also very clearly aimed at a wider audience (""We break it down so you can figure out if HIIT is right for you""), making it's suitability to that wider audience pretty on topic. It might not need to be repeated as often as it is but it seems appropriate here, to me at least."
AdvancedFitness,20pb09,vohk,2,Thu Mar 20 00:04:04 2014 UTC,"Rugby is a contact sport (and a pretty brutal one, at that). Crossfit is a routine workout, the comparison is ridiculous. However, from the sounds of it, since you've played rugby, I think it's safe to assume that you've worked out at least semi-regularly. I'm talking about the people who are just getting off the couch for the first time, or the soccer moms who are deciding to get fit. People who haven't exercised in a long time."

AdvancedFitness,20pb09,finitedesign,2,Wed Mar 19 22:37:12 2014 UTC,"Well, the bad is that injury rates are high and the impact on newer athletes is not as good as the impact on experienced athletes.

The first 100m are generally 95-100% effort, 85-90% down the backstretch, and picking it back up and trying to finish the last 100-150m. Though many 800m runners who get thrown into the 400m may be able to go full speed for the full lap and split evenly, while everyone else splits negative."

No, I'm not a cardiologist nor an endocrinologist;  I did research pretty thoroughly, however, including the infographic source articles and the gist I got:    Beginners will get far more from steady-state as it's easier to do, easier to stick with, and really REALLY hard to fuck up (or fuck yourself up) unlike a Cross-fit style workout. Most people doing HIIT aren't actually pushing themselves hard enough to reach that ""high intensity"" or ""max-whatever"" to get the most benefit from it anyway Unless you doing absolutely nothing other than running in place on a treadmill, you'll generally get enough variety from whatever else you cycle into your workout (e.g. weight training) to avoid most plateau effect. HIIT was really designed to increase overall fitness/oxygen consumption, not to decrease fat.   The infographic was pretty good about stressing the beginner vs. advanced getting use out of HIIT, but once you take that out and make claims about the fat loss aspect it gets wonky.  Especially if you factor in that those who are athletic probably have less fat to lose, the claims really need further scrutiny.  Just food for thought, I suppose.

You can do all the research for yourself instead of waiting for a cardiologist to come and explain it to you. Google scholar a phrase like acute cardiac effects of vigorous exercise.

AdvancedFitness,20lnz0,HuffmanDickings,2,Mon Mar 17 18:01:23 2014 UTC,"Dynamic stretching after a light warm up before activity, static stretching afterwards.  Don't static stretch a muscle right before you intend to use it."

AdvancedFitness,20lnz0,phrakture,2,Mon Mar 17 16:09:26 2014 UTC,"I presume because it specifically says that static stretching can increase range of motion but decrease force and power, for ankles anyway."
AdvancedFitness,20lnz0,floor-pi,6,Mon Mar 17 16:53:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but you can just stretch at other times not before a workout. Stretching is and always will be a useful tool in the tool box for improving ROM. Whenever some study or tidbit of information like this comes out, people like to jump on the ""Welp!

AdvancedFitness,20lnz0,phrakture,1 point,Mon Mar 17 17:31:19 2014 UTC,"I agree. I am yet to discover a study that shows enough changes in strength and/or power to not static stretch before a work out to be applicable to real life.

AdvancedFitness,20lnz0,amaye15,0,Tue Mar 18 01:34:58 2014 UTC,"You're right. However, Thomas Kurz also points out that a static stretch can reduce sensation in the muscle, which has some small possibility of increasing injury risk simply because of feeling loss...  That said... Strength and flexibility are intertwined, so I've always been curious what would happen if you stretched heavily before a lighter workout through the increased ROM (for example, pike stretches followed by some SLDLs). I wonder if that'd improve flexibility at an increased rate."
AdvancedFitness,20koo6,HyphyBlud,7,Sun Mar 16 20:17:14 2014 UTC,"Should have done a regression to determine whether or not there is a relationship between these two variates. A scatter-plot, and an equation that estimates bench press from overhead press with an R2 (how much of the variance in overhead press is explained by bench press values) value would have been easier to understand, and would have been a more interesting statistical analysis imo."
AdvancedFitness,20koo6,DocJeef,3,Mon Mar 17 02:06:20 2014 UTC,Definitely should be able to pull this out of the survey data.
AdvancedFitness,20koo6,NomadicAgenda,3,Mon Mar 17 04:05:30 2014 UTC,"I would chalk that up to issues in formulating the research question. Questions of the form ""is there a relationship between X and Y?"" are pretty much asking for regression. On the other hand, the question being asked here seems to be more along the lines of ""what is the probability distribution of X/Y?"" Which is a much more complicated question, but still one that you can answer with the regression data.  Eh, could have been a better study, but not bad for a first attempt.  edit: since I'd wager that both bench-press and overhead-press are both normally distributed, we shouldn't see what the author calls a normal distribution, but an approximate Cauchy-distribution in the data. It's pretty much what we should expect, and it seems like that's what's happening in the data. Thoughts?"
AdvancedFitness,20koo6,DocJeef,3,Mon Mar 17 04:26:58 2014 UTC,"I think you nailed it. But besides the issue of the statistics, it seems like there are shortcomings in the survey methodology. There were just three questions, but most respondents only answered the first. And rather than ask participants to state the ratio, I think it would've been much cleaner to just get the numbers. I wonder if the peak at 1.5 for the 5RM bench/ohp ratio is being driven by people making rough estimates of what the number should be (demand characteristics)."

AdvancedFitness,20koo6,DocJeef,7,Tue Mar 18 01:45:20 2014 UTC,"I don't think you can take much meaning from it, you get better at what you train for, if you neglect overhead press for your bench then the difference will be larger.

AdvancedFitness,20koo6,NomadicAgenda,2,Mon Mar 17 15:17:05 2014 UTC,"I'm still trying to figure out the point of this ratio; as they're perpendicular movements, you'd expect a roughly linear drop-off of the first muscle activation moving towards the plane of the second exercise, ie. whichever muscle movement and muscle groups are more developed would be the more effective movement, thus skewing the ratio towards 1:1 or 2:1. You should normalize this with subjective responses of who thinks their bench-press is more developed vs. OHP, or one set push-up max, etc.  Interesting to note that the ratio sits pretty comfortably within 1 to 2 for about 99% of the exercising population, though."

In regards to proper development for children, I have a few general ideas that I ""will be"" applying. I have a 1 year old daughter and absolutely think it's crucial to get her involved in some movement disciplines. I've watched our era of children abandon play, climbing trees, etc for Geocities websites, Xanga, AOL instant messenger, and Sega CD. It's a damn shame and what I'm seeing in the athletes that report to me are incredibly gifted and specialized athletes who can dunk a basketball but not do a cartwheel.  My mad-scientist experiment. I honestly could careless if they continue to do this sport/activity past childhood. I hope they find enjoyment out of the activities, but like anybody, if they dislike the activity we hope to find another complementary skill to continue their development.  1. Gymnastics/Tumbling  I don't think there is a better activity from a childhood developmental perspective to 'pick up the slack' from missing childhood 'play' activities. Jumping, hopping, balance boards, tumbling, crawling, rolling, swinging. It's amazing childhood GPP and will provide tremendous proprioceptive awareness.   2. Swimming  A lot of people can't swim (I'm a terribly inefficient swimmer) and believe swimming is just an amazing developmental sport/activity that also teaches efficient body movement and proprioception.  3.Childhood BJJ  Again, I spoke quite a bit about this already.  You might expect the pro-BJJ to come from someone quite proficient in it (I'm not - white belt here). Again, I think it teaches mutual respect, competitiveness, positive body awareness, proprioception, good use of combative skills, etc. Matter of fact, Kelly Starrett had some good information/recommendations regarding the very topic.

However, as your grappling, the shoulder being in an externally rotated position creates a more stable shoulder. Scapula retraction & depression in conjunction with shoulder external rotation.  Slumping forward in a forward shoulder position and a chronically flexed thoracic position. The postural ramifications usually results in missing thoracic extension, loss of overhead extension, and general ""Reddit-computer-guy"" forward posture.  Loss of mid-line stabilization (neutral spine position) and inability to transfer force from the floor through the core. Neither a forward rounded position nor an overextended spinal position. Find your neutral (as you wouldn't want to squat with a flexed spine nor a hyper-extended one).  Thinking stance, and overly externally rotated back foot position and subsequent valgus collapse of that back knee.

I'd like to look at their thoracic mobility and the ability to extend arms overhead. Loss of thoracic extension and they would lose shoulder ROM. Appropriate shoulder and latissimus strength. Tons of rotator cuff work with perturbations.  Pay attention to lumbar stabilization in regards to core training.

I have noticed that most of my bad injuries tend to happen just after my season ends right as my training tapers and I go back into non-competition shape. (I'm a competitive rock-climber, so I still climb and train during the off season, just not as hard or regimented.)  Do you have any off/pre season tips that may help to raise all-around fitness without much mass gain?  Due to the nature of climbing, many competitors (Unfortunately, sometimes myself included) obsess over trying to boost general fitness without gaining excess weight--sometimes to the point of eating disorders and overtraining. Basically, what are your favorite cardio/full-body workouts/movements to give to athletes who participate in sports where strength-to-weight ratios are very important.  Again, thank you so much!"
AdvancedFitness,20f494,161803398874989,2,Sat Mar 15 21:29:31 2014 UTC,DO a thorough assessment at the end of the season and re-screen for any new asymmetries that may have occurred throughout the season.

AdvancedFitness,20f494,bradroepke,5,Fri Mar 14 23:25:27 2014 UTC,"You will have a better feel for your body than I or any nutritionist would. Also as a S&C, detailed nutritional information is a bit outside my scope of practice but just some recommendations.  With any weight-sensitive sport, one must pay respect to the fact that performance will be positively or negatively affected by the amount of weight one carries. As far as nutrition goes for weight-sensitive sports, I think the best approach would be one that allows for the following things:   A low percentage of body fat while maintaining the muscular mass (FFM) you already have. An approach that allows you enough energy to practice intensely without compromising your recovery. Enough calories to maintain a normal menstruation (assuming your female).   I know this likely doesn't answer your question specifically but I hope it might provide the outline to what your looking for. A lot of what we do is built around getting athletes to eat more nutrient rich foods, understanding proper serving sizes, and making better (healthier) nutritional choices.  Outside of improving what they consume, we focus on never allowing athletes to really get ""out of shape"".  All of our athletes aggressively weight train. All of them do some form of HIIT sprinting, cycling, prowler pushes, slideboard, etc. Nearly all of our athletes do some form of power development; olympic lifts, kettlebells, prowlers, plyometrics, hills, etc."

Don't chase the numbers on a back squat, but rather, master getting a great front squat to truly a deep depth. Learn how to do a full chin-up with the arms fully extended.

I'd GREATLY appreciate it if youth coaches could chill out a bit on the SAQ (Speed/Agility/Quickness) training; hurdles, agility ladders, viper-cords, side-winders, etc.  Eric Cressey nailed it with this (http://youtu.be/Y0ge2TYDllw)  I also understand that it's logistically easier to throw down some ladders and hurdles and take 'kids' through SAQ rather than investing the time into TEACHING movements in the weight room.

AdvancedFitness,20f6ln,llbad,3,Sat Mar 15 00:01:37 2014 UTC,"Because ideally, you should be working on your flexibility limitations until they are no longer an issue. In this way, you wouldn't rely on having your toes out."

Moderate to high intensity resistance training (Strength, Hypertrophy, moderate volume, moderate to high intensity,  moderate to long duration, exhausting) followed by low intensity, long duration cardio training (Steady state, low exertion levels, continuous) . I feel you could do either or on this one.  I recently did #1, and it was not enjoyable to lift afterwards. I did 15 minutes of HIIT ( 2 minutes at 6 mph, 3 minutes of 10 mph (30 seconds on, 30 seconds walking), repeated three times.)  and I tried lifting afterwards and it was tough. The problem was that I decided to do a muscular endurance and plyometric leg day, which was tough. I have never fought so hard in my life to complete a workout, that HIIT training wiped me out which is surprising because I am a boot camp instructor and have a VO2 max in the 99th percentile.

AdvancedFitness,20bn9g,eric_twinge,3,Fri Mar 14 18:56:05 2014 UTC,"That is exactly my point.  When people say: ""higher protein diets result in X health benefits"" they are often actually saying ""lower effective calorie diets result in X health benefits"".    E.g.   A difference of 5% or greater in percentage protein between diets at 12mo was associated with a 3 fold greater effect size compared with <5% (p = 0.038) in fat mass (0.9 vs. 0.3 kg). Fasting triglyceride and insulin were also lower with high protein diets with effect sizes of 0.17 and 0.22, p = 0.003 and p = 0.042 respectively. Other lipids and glucose were not different.

Are there exercises I can do to build up strength to do this stretch safely? I've apparently been doing the not-so-great-way of stretching for the middle splits by leaning forward with my hands/forearms off the ground, which significantly relieves any knee pain."
AdvancedFitness,20ah5a,failon,4,Thu Mar 13 04:28:08 2014 UTC,"It's not so much building up strength (ligaments don't really strengthen like muscles) as manipulating leverages.  If the point of contact for the force that stretches your hips into abduction is at the feet, it has a long lever arm to act on the knee, creating valgus torque and stress on the MCL. If it's applied closer to the knee, the lever arm is reduced, and though the force needed to stretch might be greater (less mechanical advantage), less of it is rotational (valgus) and so there's less stress on the MCL.  You can also take advantage of the fact that many of the structures you do want to stretch don't need a strictly frontal plane movement to stretch them. A hamstring stretch with the leg externally rotated, turning your pelvis away, can work at those same muscles from a slightly different angle that can still help with developing your splits ROM without putting as much stress on the MCL, since more of the stretch is coming across the back of the knee."

AdvancedFitness,206apl,mrcosmicna,0,Wed Mar 12 01:06:06 2014 UTC,"Definition of the populace you're addressing is of utmost importance here. Passive posture is (in my opinion) a very serious offence when it comes to lifting. It wrecks all kind of havoc on muscle activation, potential, etc,.   If you're not performing any sort of athletic movements throughout the week, then I'd agree with you.  Are my opinions incorrect? If you feel they are, could you point me in a direction I haven't considered yet?"
AdvancedFitness,206apl,down_vote_city__,4,Wed Mar 12 01:55:59 2014 UTC,"I guess it comes down to what you are looking at.    If you are looking at passive, unloaded posture as a source of pain in an athletic populace, then I would question you.  I would rather look at what they are doing in training, then passive posture.  You can have somebody who is excessively kyphotic, but with the correct cueing look fine under load.  Passive posture is simply not enough of a stimulus to elicit nociception.  But a poorly performed deadlift sure is.  As for the etiology of pain, I linked to some stuff in another post, but the current mode of thinking with things like non ""red flagged"" lbp is more of a neurogenic, rather than structural, model."
AdvancedFitness,206apl,mrcosmicna,1 point,Wed Mar 12 02:14:22 2014 UTC,"Well, wouldn't a kyphotic posture necessarily dictate that the body compensates to move within this less-than-ideal posture? Something small could set off a chain reaction leading to a radiating pain in your LB, right?   I understand (and agree with) what you're saying about a properly loaded dead-lift but your body isn't under constant external stress and thus incorrect motor patterns are re-enforced absent of a load (if they're present). E.g. it takes a considerable amount of stabilization to perform a full ROM BW squat properly.   And, that's not to mention that a squat or deadlift may look to be properly loading the spine but that doesn't account for neural programming. You can squat weight up with your back and hip-flexors all day long without your glutes or hamstrings showing up to the party. Thus, repeating, ""Sit back!"" and ""push the ground away!"" are falling on deaf ears because the athlete doesn't know how to use such cues. Now, this may be an issue of training the movement but it might also be an issue of APT turning your glutes off when you fire out of the hole.   I don't disagree that the pain is inflicted by a neurological response but I can't wrap my head around your LB muscles just sending off pain signals without some sort of global reason. Absent of the immediate causes for concern (pinched nerve, slipped disc, degenerated disc), I have yet to see a reason be put forth more compelling than the positive correlation between passive posture and LBP.   As for the etiology of pain, I linked to some stuff in another post, but the current mode of thinking with things like non ""red flagged"" lbp is more of a neurogenic, rather than structural, model.   Were you implying that LBP was a sort of psychosomatic response? Or, that it was an isolated response to localized pain like a pinched nerve?"

When you get hurt, the pain receptors send pain signals up to the brain and we sense pain, right? Wrong.  We have no ‘pain’ receptors. It is physiologically more correct to call them nociceptors because they are very similar to other receptors which sense temperature, pressure, and chemicals (called non-nociceptive receptors). The only difference between the two is that the nociceptors have a higher threshold than the non-nociceptors and are only activated when the stimuli is in the higher range.

I'll add that the biomechanical model (APT/PPT) has been shown to be very, very inaccurate when predicting pain. Link  Here's more info on the nature of pain from wiki:   Nociception (synonym: nocioception or nociperception) is the encoding and processing in the nervous system of noxious stimuli.[1] It is the afferent activity in the peripheral and central nervous systems produced by stimulation of specialized free nerve endings called ""nociceptors"" or ""pain receptors"" that only respond to tissue damage or other intense chemical (e.g., chilli powder in the eyes), mechanical (e.g., pinching, crushing) or thermal (heat and cold) stimulation.[2][3] Once stimulated, a nociceptor sends a signal along a chain of nerve fibers via the spinal cord to the brain. Nociception triggers a variety of autonomic responses and may also result in a subjective experience of pain in sentient beings.[3] Nociceptive neurons generate trains of action potentials in response to intense stimuli, and the frequency of firing determines the intensity of the pain"

AdvancedFitness,206apl,OmniaMors,2,Tue Mar 11 23:11:51 2014 UTC,"Awesome!  Sub-optimal breathing pattern is another way to say your breathing muscles or the gas exchange process in your lungs isn't working as well as it could be. Your muscles could be weakened and cause all kinds of funky breathing rhythms (for example, your rib cage getting smaller when you inhale), or you could have obstructions or restrictions in your lungs such as mucous or poor expansion/contraction of alveoli (little sacs that aid in gas exchange).  You are correct that nerves control muscles! Just as your muscles get stronger when you train, the nerves controlling those muscles become ""stronger"" in their connections to those muscles, and the subsequent control on those muscles that they have. The more you exercise your abdominals in a certain way, the more efficient and effective they will become due to the increase in nerve efficiency/effectiveness in sending a message, as well as the increased muscle strength or endurance.

I've never done Westside before, and was curious if:  You just cycled between squat/deadlift for lower body days, and bench/ohp for upper body days.   Did you also just do the normal movement (high bar squat, deadlift, regular bench, regular ohp) for both DE/ME days?

This way, you dont stall and you can max out every week. Focusing on weak points is big. Most people can't bench a lot/squat a lot because their tris/posterior chain is weak.   But from twinge's comment link, I found a different article on the same webpage giving an example of an ME and an DE day with just back squats, which clearly doesn't mesh with ""the concept behind Westside.""

I would literally skip down the track and then roll into a run. This helped keep me light on my feet, and getting this form down was important to be able to sprint, change gears, and simply move efficiently. Most people already have this skill, but it's a good warmup drill anyways. A and B skips Knee-ups. I don't know if anyone else does these or what their official name is, but I got these from my friend who runs a low-15 5k. This is where you're standing still and you bring your knees up to your chest and down one at a time. This is my favorite drill because it warms me up and cools me down with both a form of light stretching and a way to get my butt muscles warmed up. Doing them before my runs gives me a noticeable difference in performance. Doing them after my runs helps me feel better the next day. Leg swings. Just grab ahold of a fence or post or tree or whatever and gently swing your leg (either left-right or front-back, both is always a good choice) so that you're not stressing your muscles too much, but still giving them a light warmup and stretch.

If you have higher mileage, you can have shorter intervals (400m-800m); make sure to do them with minimal rest in between, though! I think you would get a kick out of doing those shorter intervals since it plays more to your powerlifting strengths (hah).  Here's more reading and charts on intervals:   Charts What does it MEAAAAAAAAAAAAN?   Sprint drills will make you a faster runner across all distances.

It's not so much about pairing certain runs with upper and lower body days, it's about balancing the desired work with your ability to recover.    In that webinar (and what is borne out in his template) Alex explains how you keep your intense lifting early in the week and your more demanding runs later in the week, all while attempting to ensure one workout does not detract from the next.  So you end up with a sort of balanced stress level through the whole week, but in such a way where you're still 'fresh' for the next session."

The 4.4cm margin in error of the measurements is way bigger than the 0.8cm difference in jump height.  tl;dr: don't read into this too much."
AdvancedFitness,1zxu8t,Jadien,9,Sun Mar 9 16:26:54 2014 UTC,"This is a knee-jerk response that most people have when seeing overlapping error bars.  I also think this paper is shit with some p-value stars, but my main critique is the sample size of 16. If, for example, they had sampled 16,000 students and gotten the same results (1cm overall mean difference with 4cm error bars), it would be more suggestive that there is something biologically ocurring.  This worrisome error-bar overlap does imply that, even if the conclusions of the paper are true, if I or any other individual person were to drink these drinks then we would not necessarily jump higher. While the individual application of science is an important condiseration, it is not the main target of most reserach. If you can statistically determine that there is some biological phenomenon occurring, no matter what the error bars, then you have identified a new level of physiological understanding. The error bars are taken into consideration in the p-value.  For example (again assuming there was a reasonable sample size and this paper had true conclusions), it may be that caffeine is only effective on particular neural pathways involved in jumping in only a subset of the students. Future research can further dissect the details, but what a p-value is supposed to suggest is that according to the numbers something is occuring, that in some way the variables are related. A definitive treatment or cure is often much farther down the pipeline."

AdvancedFitness,1zux6w,jsh,14,Sat Mar 8 01:39:11 2014 UTC,"The VMO may or may not exist, and if it does, and you are squatting/strengthening your legs, why would you need to work on activating it?  I'm sure it is ""activating"" just fine as you extend and flex the knee through a full range of motion..  Unless your quads are denervated.  In which case I'll give you that one.  As for forward, walking lunges, they do cause a great deal of deceleration stress on the patella, something which /u/troublesome has addressed here before.  I don't know why there is concern about running on a treadmill.  Especially considering you can set it up to bias concentric contractions (uphill).  I don't know why there is concern about posterior chain activation on a treadmill.  I'm confident that the muscles that extend the hip, flex the knee, dorsi and plantarflex the ankle and provide multiplanar stability are doing their job.  A better option if you have knee problems is to avoid running altogether, and fix your knee problems.  And not rely on meatheaded t-nation articles.  I am also curious as to his logic behind an elevated forefoot position reducing patellafemoral compression/shear.  There is also nothing even remotely new in this article.  The VMO has been suggested as being important in PF pain and maltracking for a very, very long time."
AdvancedFitness,1zux6w,mrcosmicna,3,Sat Mar 8 04:01:02 2014 UTC,"I'm sure it is ""activating"" just fine as you extend and flex the knee through a full range of motion.    I agree that the VMO is not really a thing that exists, but I also think a lot of people just say VMO instead of vastus medialis, and they don't mean that there's an extra little muscle in there.  Also, according to my PT professors, sometimes VM just likes to turn off. The other muscles in your legs may be functioning fine, you may be able to squat and everything, but the tiniest little bit of pain can inhibit vastus medialis and start causing other issues. It's a little bitch of a muscle.  Edit: Also, I didn't waste my time reading the T-Nation article, so I have no idea if my comment is relevant. If it isn't, just ignore me."
AdvancedFitness,1zux6w,Strikerrjones,7,Sat Mar 8 18:08:26 2014 UTC,"Yes, the VM, along with the medial retinaculum and the MCL, are implicated in ""maltracking"".  However there is considerable literature on how vague and unhelpful the diagnosis of ""maltracking"" or ""lateral knee translation"" or ""patella hypermobility"" or ""patella instability"" is.  A better model is one that defers to the tissue homeostasis model and, as far as mechanics are concerned, evaluates the entire mechanism.  Another problem with VMO strengthening, although not suggested in this article, was a previous model whereby patients would squeeze a block in between their knees whilst doing exercises ie leg press.  But this is problematic for knees due to creating an internal rotation and valgus moment, something that the literature again says isn't so great for sore knees.  Knee pain is also problematic because as far as tissue damage is concerned, there are so many things that can go wrong.  Ie, patella tendinopathy (not tendinitis - which has 3 separate stages, all of which have different management protocols), impingement of the infrapatellar fat pads, friction of the infrapatellar fat pad under the inferior pole of the patella (these 2 are often misdiagnosed as patella tendinopathy), ITB syndrome, menisci damage, tightness/laxity of the MCL and LCL, damage to the ACL/PCL, plus structural problems such as patella alta, patella baja, hypermobility (hyperextension beyond normal), cartilage degeneration, tenosynivitis, rheumatic conditions, metabolic conditions, BMD problems, stress fractures to the patella, developmental problems like osgood schlatters or sindig-larsen-johansson's syndrome, cystic lesions ie bakers cyst, excessive lateral pressure syndrome, global patella pressure syndrome, plica syndrome, plus direct trauma of any type (Acl tear) or the iatrogenic effects of a structural surgery (fibrosis etc).  Do you see how clueless ""knee pain"" is?  Strengthen the VMO has become a massive, massive cop out for knee pain.  It's like saying to a low back pain patient that they need to ""strengthen their core"".  But there are so many factors that modulate the expression of LBP beyond mechanics.  Maybe that might help mechanically.  But it is only one small part of the biomechanics of the lower limb.    According to this paper, not only is the VM atrophied in PFPS cases, but the entire quadriceps are.  But does this atrophy cause PFPS, or does PFPS cause quad atrophy?  Another fun thing to do is pick up an EMS unit, and try and isolate your vastus medialis.  I can guarantee your whole quads will contract.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19212898  This is the best study on the topic of AKP:  http://www.patellofemoral.org/pfoe/PDFs/VICENTE_2.pdf"

AdvancedFitness,1zux6w,SaneesvaraSFW,1 point,Sun Mar 9 02:29:38 2014 UTC,So question: Is there a general stretch/movement/exercise that can be done to improve overall knee health? Or is it just too complicated for one or a couple basic movements to cover?
AdvancedFitness,1zux6w,Stopsign002,2,Mon Mar 10 22:11:00 2014 UTC,"The latter.  If you have a positive anterior or posterior drawer test, you generally need surgery.  If you have degenerative (grade 3) patella tendinopathy, you just need to bite down on a piece of leather and squat.  If you have a reactive patella tendinopathy, you need to rest until it goes away, and then rehab it. Cortisone injections are sometimes used for fat pad impingements.  ITB syndrome responds very well to hip strengthening.  Degenerative arthritis isn't going to get any better with rest.  Every problem is different and requires different management.  Plus the biomechanics of the individual must be analysed in depth.  Chronic knee injuries (""my knees hurt""; with no acute injury or ""red flags"", which is referred to as ""patellafemoral pain syndrome"") respond well to activity modification (resting from things that elicit nociception) and graded rehab (getting stronger whilst avoiding flare ups), as well as education about pain.  They also respond well to a proper differential diagnosis.  I recommend a sports doctor.  They are humble enough to write you a referral for an MRI if they can't figure out what's wrong, unlike PTs.  And yes, I just made a strawman.  Generally, a properly performed and programmed squat is the best thing you can do for your knees.  However, there is such a wide spectrum of knee pathologies that if your knees hurt whilst squatting properly, you need to consult with a medical professional.  Chances are that the problem is there and moving under load is enough of a stimulus to elicit nociception.  There are certain activities which are not so knee friendly (something like 45% of volleyball players have knee pathology), and certain leg exercises which are not so good for knees (a badly performed squat).  If you have knee pain, here is your checklist:   Is it residual? Is it stopping me from doing what I want to do? Is it interfering with my quality of life?   If the answer is yes to any of the above, see a competent medical professional who works with athletes. There is no one stretch you can do to fix it and trying to rehab an injury with layman's knowledge is generally dumb."

AdvancedFitness,1zuprx,blue_fitness,4,Sat Mar 8 01:04:01 2014 UTC,"There is no universal optimal hip height. Everyone's hips will start from a different position.   To find yours, just set up like you normally would and start to pull the bar. If you started too low, your hips will shoot up (not excessively)  before the weight lifts off the floor. Then, next rep/set START in that position! Start the hips in the position where your hips went.  If you started too high, you'll feel tons of strain on your lower back. Start lower next rep/set.

Maybe it's because of my history in track and cross country, but this isn't surprising.  You can't just do one kind of workout over and over and expect to get optimal gains in endurance training.  I don't think this experiment proves anything.  That's not to say that it's wrong, but the method here was not very good."
AdvancedFitness,1zrerh,MHath,4,Fri Mar 7 18:01:27 2014 UTC,"The method here is fine, and it does prove that doing different workouts over time produces great results.

The participants could have all been in different stages of training.  Some could've gone into the test already being affected by overtraining.

While everyone 'knows' what the results will be, we can't just 'know' we need evidence. Also, the magnitude is important. In fact, I find it very surprising that endurance athletes don't respond just as well to lots of threshold work. Based on body systems, this should provide a great stimulus for growth. Of course, in my other comment, I [link an article](www.ncbi.nih.gov/pubmed/20861522/) showing more threshold work has detrimental effects to cyclists.  As a great man once said...

Of course if you're talking about a 300 lb lineman, then maybe you'd opt for the general health benefits of aerobics.    From a performance standpoint though, I'd wager you're just looking to keep a good baseline of work capacity.  If so, I'd go with the more traditional GPP like sled drags, prowler work, etc."

Creatine doesn't benefit the 800 meter.  Caffeine could, but is considered a performance enhancing drug in competition.  Protein supplementation doesn't really benefit the 800.  They are really just talking about 800 performance.  Scientist tend not to generalize results beyond the study."

Plus any max strength and strength-speed work they do will benefit from the extra CP."
AdvancedFitness,1zkvj0,mrcosmicna,7,Wed Mar 5 03:03:59 2014 UTC,"Possibly.  At the middle distance, you're not really into CP/ATP, but starting into aerobic glycolysis.  CP system exhausts after about 10 sec, enough for the 100 meter, not the 800.  People at the 800 aren't doing the intense strength training of sprinters.  800 is not a sprint.

AdvancedFitness,1zkvj0,Strikerrjones,-1,Wed Mar 5 03:13:16 2014 UTC,"Depends on the cogency of the S&C program.  Yes 800 uses CP/ATP and fast and slow glycolysis.  CP is still used.  Get my gist?   Here are a few studies from examine.com w/r/t creatine on ergo., that directly contradict you.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20543729 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19909536 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19706374  Most pertinently, 400m swim sprint performance improved:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16083193  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14767410  And if creatine mono improves anaerobic performance, which is a constituent of any 800m runner's training program, then why wouldn't you take it?  Maybe /u/silverhydra can chime in."
AdvancedFitness,1zkvj0,Strikerrjones,3,Wed Mar 5 03:39:34 2014 UTC,"I didn't say it didn't use CP, it just exhausts early, and is not a major contributor at that distance.  Where do you get the term slow and fast glycolysis? It is anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis.  You are over extrapolating the studies you cite.  You assume that they will add up to 800 performance.  To try and extrapolate a swim study to running shows you really don't get exercise physiology.  Just because both relate to cardiovascular systems doesnt mean they will correlate.  That is like saying cycling performance in a criterium will extrapolate to 5 k run times or capacities.  Not the same thing.  Like your use of cogency and ergo.  Very erudite.  I would suggest you read McArdle and Katch's text on exercise physiology like I did in undergrad and grad.  Aside from all those classes on it.

For starters, aerobic and anareobic are poor terms w/r/t glycolysis, due to the fact that glycolysis itself does not depend on oxygen and are therefore not practical for describing the process of fast and slow glycolysis.  Maybe you should update your terminology, and become more erudite. I can guarantee you if you pick up any ex fizz book written in the last ~5 yrs you will see similar sentiments expressed re nomenclature.  Sure, you originally brought up energy systems and how the 800m differs from the 100m in this respect, so that it is what I chose to focus on.  I agree that 400m swimming is not the same as 800m running, but you brought up energy systems, so that was the most relevant study I could find.  Maybe you should read more."

Great part of teaching, free review copies of texts.   Ex fizz, really.... So show me a quote or cite a text to back your point.  Best I can figure is you read Brown's textbook and misunderstood it. Glycolysis does not rely on O2, but the levels of O2 do determine the metabolites at the end of glycolysis.  In low O2 levels, more lactate, in higher O2 levels, less lactate.  I also now that energy systems or a continuum, not either/or situations.  Again, the swim study had nothing to do with the discussion, just grabbing at straws. It wasn't close to relevant.  Again, you take a bunch of studies and throw them in a blender and try to make science out of it.  Nice chart, I memorized it in high school, then college, then grad school.  Again, O2 levels determine end point metabolites, hence the use of aerobic and anaerobic.  As for reading more, I am more than familiar with the various consensus statements on creatine.  That doesn't mean that it is shown to improve performance in the 800.  You are using a broad statement to talking about a specific situation.  You can't do that. Show me studies, not just one, because science happens by consensus, that shows improved performance from creatine in the 800.  Until then, not so much.

The biggest problems I see regarding this study are 1) the dietary information was collected via a 24-hour recall from the study participants once.  So, the study is depending on the one account of one day's diet to accurately reflect that study participant's diet over 18 years.  This problem is explicitly flagged by the authors on page 414.  Second, and of greater relevance to the fitness population, the study doesn't seem to control for obesity at all.  This is especially troublesome given the study's small sample size of people who died of diabetes who didn't have diabetes at baseline (that is, when they filled out the dietary survey).  As the study points out, if you're diagnosed with diabetes you might end up eating a low-carb, low-fat diet due to doctor's orders.  It shouldn't be surprising if you then die of diabetes--and it wasn't the protein's fault!  I'm no kind of biochemist or dietitian though, and I'd be interested to read a more informed critique."

Do athletes supplement these two vitamins specifically in higher dosages? 1000mg of Vitamin C is much higher than one would find in a typical multivitamin. Why was there not a performance difference between the two groups given the almost 3 months of treatment? Is a VO2 max and shuttle runs the best way to determine the decrease in muscular endurance?  Apparently in a vit C supplementation study with rats, VO2 max was not effected significantly, but the rats capacity to run until exhaustion was. Interestingly they had them run on a treadmill with a shock pad at the rear to motivate the rats to run. They determined exhaustion when they no longer had the will to get off the shock pad and were unable to right themselves when lying on their backs. Then they killed them two days later.

The more a movement pattern is ingrained, the more the CNS adapts to do it as efficiently as it can. Thus, when training a pushing exercise on a horizontal plane e.g. dumbbell press, the CNS is also becoming better adapted for other horizontal pushing exercises like bench press. There is some carry over to vertical pressing motions such as overhead press, in as much that supporting muscle groups such as core and small stabilizing muscles used in both movements are getting trained, and the areas of the arm and chest strengthened by the horizontal pressing will be better prepared for vertical pressing and so on, however it is a separate movement and thus requires that specific set of muscles to contract/relax and since that is a different firing pattern that uses some different muscles, the carryover can only go so far.

AdvancedFitness,1zcnx4,NomadicAgenda,2,Sun Mar 2 19:17:05 2014 UTC,"As to your original question, I remember recently reading a section in Supertraining describing joint angles and heavy isometrics. The basic idea was that heavy isometrics produce a strength increase not just at the specifically trained joint angle, but also at angles above and below that angle. This strength increase and range of affected angles is dependent on the original joint angle trained. I believe the general finding was that larger angles (a more stretched muscle) elicit larger and more widespread strength gains along the entire range of motion than do small joint angles.   This is just one specific answer to your question. Your original question actually covers an incredibly amount of muscle physiology and training science. My answer is just one tree among the forest."

AdvancedFitness,1zcnx4,xediii,2,Sun Mar 2 22:08:26 2014 UTC,"I think that you have 1) a broad question--how much does any exercise carry over to any other--that can only be answered in physiological generalities (as jakhak does so well above), and 2) a series of specific questions that can be answered in more detail, for instance RDL/DL carryover, lunge/lunge-with-rotation carryover, and so on.   Strength is one of the most general adaptations, but it is still movement-specific. Some exercises have more carry-over to others, either because they develop more strength in absolute terms, or because they develop strength in a particular way that is beneficial to another specific exercise.   It's going to vary person-to-person as well: someone whose weak point in the deadlift is their hamstrings is going to get more DL-specific carry-over out of RDLs than someone whose weak point in the deadlift is the break off the floor. But someone who develops a lot of strength using only the RDL is still going to be able to do a pretty damn good DL without training for it specifically.  How much does a lunge with rotation carry over to an ""ordinary"" lunge? I dunno. What's an ordinary lunge? Is the trainee unstable at the bottom of the lunge, which could be helped by accumulating more time under tension in that specific phase of the exercise (like one would with the rotation variation)? Do they have limited hip mobility that training the rotation could help? Or is their limitation merely maximal single-leg strength that would be best trained with heavier lunges without rotation?  tl;dr The degree of crossover in strength training varies from exercise to exercise and person to person."

There's been some studies by McArdle (that's his last name) that presents the issue. Basically what jakhak says, there's some crossover to other movements, but if you want to get better at doing cleans, you should be working on cleans. There are some people that are trying to go in depth about specificity, whether it is to challenge it, or just to elaborate on it, but as far as now, it's all about specificity if you want to get good at one particular thing."

Try something else that abducts the shoulder neutral (lateral raises) or in external rotation (shoulder press) and you will be less limited in your ROM due to your lack of IR.

On the other hand, if the problem is that you can't do upright rows because you are missing IR, you should work to address that. Check out this video for a stretch that may help. I would say these are both problems and you should incorporate work into your routine to address both. Also wouldn't hurt to have a physio/physical therapist assess your shoulder to find out what is causing your lack of IR. Hope this helps."

AdvancedFitness,1z5cc3,shrillthrill,12,Fri Feb 28 03:16:00 2014 UTC,"This is very interesting, but I would like to point out a few key limitations in the study.  The authors are funded and employed by a supplement company. This is not damning in and of itself, but studies with financial interests in the results tend to be poorly designed or omit key limitations.  There is a significant difference in the strength levels of the groups, as measured by torque. The high omega group (>4 group) had 24h torque of 50Nm vs 38Nm in the low omega group (<4 group). This implies large differences at baseline as well, but these are not reported. Torque raw scores should be normalized through allometric scaling or at least by weight to be relevant, and this is not done. Nor do they report information such as height/weight of the subjects for the reader to make the judgement himself.  At 96 hours, the >4 group had increased it's torque to 52Nm while the <4 group had increased to 42, almost twice the increase. This is not discussed but it could indicate a blunting of the training response by the >4 group. It is also likely due to the much greater strength levels in the >4 group.  Reporting of the statistical procedures performed are dodgy. They state they use t-tests or anova ""as appropriate"", but they do not say when they do the anova. They only state one related samples t-test result explicitly. Considering how many endpoints they examine and how many series of measurements they do, they really need to fully report the statistics.  They make statements about quality of life based off of the emotional stability index. This has not been demonstrated in healthy populations such as young college students. A better bet would have been a quality of life questionnaire, but this is probably a pointless measure in this research design.   There is no accounting for gender differences between groups. There is no attempt to account for any confounders at all either, a huge limitation.  The authors discuss one key limiation, the difference between groups in terms of o3 levels was simply not that big. Out of a 12 point scale, the groups scored averages of 3.94 vs 5.4. They do not discuss if this difference was statistically significant, but less than one SD seperates the groups so it's unlikely that it represents a significant difference and very unlikely that it represents a meaningful clinical difference.  Bottom line, the study is poorly designed to answer the quetsions it poses with inadequate reporting of key elements for any meaningful interpretation of the results. The abstract is very favorable towards o3 supplementation, and the authors are sponsored by a supplement company that sells o3 supplements.   Edit: full text"
AdvancedFitness,1z5cc3,MrSquat,3,Fri Feb 28 09:49:06 2014 UTC,Is it possible that reduced inflammation could result in reduced hypertrophy? Isn't inflammation part of what fuels hypertrophy?
AdvancedFitness,1z5cc3,Bakaichi,4,Fri Feb 28 06:35:59 2014 UTC,"Yes, that is very possible. The study results even indicate as much, with the low omega group raising the torque raw value twice as much as the high omega group.   Studies on nsaids indicate that the hypertrophy response is reduced if workload is the same. Perhaps lower inflammation allows a greater workload to be performed, which accumulates to greater gainz over time but this is speculation.  Workload is not reported between groups for the exercise intervention. That is unfortunate."

These stuff might work, but if you to devise a scale of things that will help you from virtually useless to fixing your problem, it would be on the former end of the spectrum.  Plus you should see a sports doctor or a physiotherapist.  Please also know that all of the following is my opinion and awfully shotgun diagnosis because I can't look at you in person.  There's a good chance you have developed a reactive patella tendinopathy.  This can occur due to an acute increase in load.  Basketball players are especially prone to problems with the patella tendon (ligament) due to the fact that jumping is very demanding on the connective tissue of the knee.  I suggest you rest until you are pain free.  If the pain persists for more than another week, than you definitely need to see a sports doctor/physio.  The unfortunate part about a reactive tendinopathy is that they will not heal if you do not rest them, and they can develop into a failed healing process, and then eventually a degenerative tendinopathy, if you don't take the time off to let them heal.  But, the flipside of this is the good news that they respond very well to rest.  NSAIDs, ice, the usual anti-inflam stuff, is also beneficial during this period.  I suggest you stay off it until it doesn't hurt.  Once you are pain free.  Think of the following:   Am I strong enough? Have I lost strength since I last played basketball?  Have I lost any size in my legs since I last played?  If so, I highly recommend reconditioning strength and hypertrophy in a controlled gym environment.  Squats, glute ham raises, deadlift variations, unilateral stuff, whatever you use to train leg strength, may be highly beneficial.  As always, use proper form, and if it hurts, don't do it.  Gradual increases in load. Technique.  Analyse your jumping, with particular care that you are avoiding things like genu valgum, and that you have very good technique.  All the strength work in the world can't compensate for poor jumping, running, cutting etc in basketball.  Load.  Are you able to tolerate your level of training volume?  I'm guessing no.  You might have to back off a lot in terms of training volume, and then gradually rebuild back to the point where you can train normally.   And I would like to reinforce yet again that I highly recommend a medical healthcare professional."
AdvancedFitness,1z43fm,mrcosmicna,1 point,Fri Feb 28 02:09:41 2014 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion. I have this week free so I'll give my knees some rest and work a little on jumping technique when they feel better.
AdvancedFitness,1z43fm,newaccountforit,3,Fri Feb 28 09:19:08 2014 UTC,"Warm up properly - light muscle activity, dynamic or isometric stretches, get the body warm, which affects the synovial fluid to help protect the joint.  Neuromotor recruitment training - isometric quadriceps holds will help in stabilizing the knee by improving both slow and fast motor neuron recruitment and firing rate, improving your ability to stabilize the structures of the knee and transfer force through the musculature. The great thing is these are effective at improving muscle function without the high forces required with external weights. You can do these while resting, which I agree with mrcosmicna on being a good idea. Do these while you watch tv.  Hold your leg straight and tighten the quads (particularly medialis, which is likely weaker unless you've trained it) as much as you can, try to pull the patella back towards the opposite hip. Later you can use a leg extension machine to increase the difficulty, as well as more common leg exercises.   This article is about ACL injury prevention specificially, but it has some great drills for improving knee function. http://www.strengthcoach.com/public/1641.cfm  As others have mentioned, foam rolling is a good bet, and fish oil or glucosamine are worth considering although the benefit-risk has not been fully established."

AdvancedFitness,1z43fm,noethos,4,Thu Feb 27 20:25:53 2014 UTC,"Just my two cents here.  Load up on DHA/EPA fishoil, take a huge amount, I've heard estimates from experts such as Dr. John Benardi say to take as high as 1gram for every % of body fat you have per day. But do your research. Fish oils is a great anti-inflammatory for the joints.  Start a foam rolling/soft tissue and mobility routine where you are targeting the the legs, ankles an hips and working out adhesions and knots to rebalance the muscles. The knee tends to be ""the whipping boy"" for dysfunction else wear in the body especially if you've had hip or ankle injuries in the past. But if you have had any prior injuries to the knee what I say may go out the window.  There is a mobility/stability joint model developed by Grey Cook and Michael Boyle that focuses giving stability to joints that are mobility joints and giving mobility to joints that are stability joints. So what that looks like is giving mobility exercises to the Thoracic spine, hips, and ankles and giving stability exercises to the knees, lumbar spine and shoulder girdle.  In the gym, focus on doing exercise that will train intra-muscular coordination and are closed chain. Exercise such as Goblet squats, kettlebell swings, Turkish get-ups, single leg dead lifts and reverse lunges.  I'm sure others on this thread can expand on any of these subjects and correct me if I misstated something."

AdvancedFitness,1yzspo,AhmedF,15,Wed Feb 26 15:21:58 2014 UTC,"So, they measured acute protein synthesis on the very first day of training, then never measured it again, but measured muscle size increase over 16 weeks of training, and didn't find a correlation. Well, no shit, right?   They do throw this into the discussion section:   The absence of a significant correlation between the acute early measure of MPS in the untrained state and chronic hypertrophy, in the present study, could be explained by a number of subject-specific changes in the MPS response in terms of: magnitude at times later during the training program, specificity of the protein fraction-specific (i.e., myofibrillar vs. non-myofibrillar MPS response), and/or duration of the response of MPS during the course of training, variations in net muscle protein balance due to differential responses in muscle proteolysis. Clearly, however, acute early measures of MPS are not proxy measures for hypertrophy or hypertrophic potential within the same individual.   Overall, I think this is an interesting study and could have implications for exercise science methodology in the future, but the title and abstract are a little misleading and don't really reflect what I think the takeaway is. I think the important, applicable message is that if you are basing resistance training strategies off of studies that only look at acute protein synthesis after a single session of training, you are probably doing it wrong.

AdvancedFitness,1yyhhx,pabrah,9,Wed Feb 26 03:39:21 2014 UTC,"From what you described, it doesn't sound like muscular soreness but rather connective tissue (likely). I'm not a medical doctor so take it with a grain of salt, but you mention things that made me cringe reading your attempts to resolve this chronic issue.   First: Avoid excessive stretching and stop the weighted back extensions, these put the lower back through a HUGE range of motion and further irritate the area which is clearly inflamed.   DO go to the gym, but focus on exercises where your back is resisting movement rather than going through a big range of motion. Let the connective tissue heal; this tissue type is mostly acellular and takes MUCH LONGER than a muscle does to heal. Resisting movement doesn't mean you can't use weight, just be smart and when you start to feel pain, immediately stop.   Your symptoms predict that:    Deadlifts are probably out, but rack pulls may still be in (less on the lower erectors, more on mid to upper back typically).  Low-bar squat may be out but slow and controlled front squat is in (more upright torso). To hit the gluts, rear-foot elevated squats or heavy lunges are great and maintain an upright torso, hence not a lot of lower back strain. Remember, there are a ton of muscles in your body that don't involve your lower back, hit those hard so you'll maintain/make gains.  Great time to do heavy pull ups, very unlikely to irritate the area as it involves upper back primarily.   For symptom relief:    Hot shower / heating pad to relax the lower back, NO CRAZY FEET-BEHIND-THE-HEAD STRETCHING WHILE YOU'RE ALL WARMED UP. Let that area heal. If you're a back-sleeper, tuck a spare pillow under your knees to alleviate pain if it's giving you trouble sleeping Pay attention to your posture all day and be careful crouching down or anything that tucks the pelvis and rounds the lumbar spine; again, just let the area heal.

Also, is it still ok to foam roll the area like I've been doing?"
AdvancedFitness,1yyhhx,kintleko,2,Wed Feb 26 04:52:03 2014 UTC,"Yep, other stretches should impact it, and gentle foam rolling is all good too.

See a professional or at least look up the anatomy of the area - lumbosacral fascia, sacrum, ilium, piriformis, gulteus maximus origin, iliolumbar ligament, etc...

Fall on your butt?  Pick up anything heavy with awkward form?  Get kicked in the butt?  These might sound silly, but it's worth thinking about.  Another question - does the pain radiate down the back of your thighs?  From your description I don't think it does (correct?).  It could be something SI joint related.  As the /u/kintleko suggested, it may be prudent to avoid things that load the back isotonically.  I would avoid anything that encourages any dynamic flexion or extension of the lumbar spine.  Training the back isometrically may be optimal.  Stu Mcgill has a lot to say on this.  I also would not recommend stretching your spine.  Also take the time to make sure your form is good in all of your exercises.  If the rep loads your back and isn't perfect, it doesn't count.  Think about other things.  I mean it.  Try and distract yourself from the pain.  Figure out what bothers it and figure out what doesn't bother it.  If you have an activity that makes you not think about it, then do that.

AdvancedFitness,1yw60g,caamando,12,Tue Feb 25 14:31:37 2014 UTC,"Let me help you with your supplements: First off all, you want a fish oil supplement with only omega 3's, not with 6's,9's. You already have plenty of 6&9 in your diet, which is why Omega 3 is so beneficial when you take it. If you take a combination product, your basically ruining the effect.   Then: Vitamin D3 is fat soluble, so you need to eat fat/oils when you take it. Else you wont absorb it. 5000IU/day should be enough.  Next: 5htp& LTryptophan are precursors of the same end product - melatonin. Might as well take that if you want to take a sleep aid. To be honest, if you just develop good sleeping habits you don't need a sleep aid. Be sure to have a cold room, no computer/tv lights 30 minutes before bed and go to bed at the same time every day.  CLA is worthless, the research is hyped and it seriously doesn't help that much.   About the K2 & B vitamins: eat more (green) vegetables & dark red meat and you'll be fine. You don't need to take these, if your diet has enough vegetables in it.   Creatine: no need to cycle it. Just take 5gram/day thats more than plenty. Avoid taking it with caffeine.   Other than that, your daily kcal is probably on the low side. I might have missed it, but I don't see your activity level, but I'm about the same as you and I train 5 times/week and I need 3500-4000kcal. Don't cut more than 1000kcal/day of your daily requirements.  And if you want to loose weight, seriously, don't believe the marketing about fat burning supplements. You need to fix your nutrition first, this will take care of 90% of your fat loss. Spend the money you save by not buying crappy supplements on healthy vegetables instead."
AdvancedFitness,1yw60g,konseptbe,1 point,Tue Feb 25 15:01:19 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  I want to try the 5HTP & LTryptophan because from what I've read in addition to the melatonin your body will synthesize serotonin as well which will improve sleep and mood. I often have trouble getting solid sleep throughout the night and want to see if this will improve it.  For the creatine, do I have to cut out caffeine entirely or can I get away with it if I take caffeine in the morning and then creatine in a shake following my afternoon workout?  My daily kCal most likely are on the low side. Is there any reason to restrict the difference to 1000kcal per day? I've heard people say that your body going into starvation mode is bs, but it could be broscience as I haven't reviewed their sources. So long as I can maintain my energy levels and not plateau in the gym or on the track should I be ok?  My workouts are as follows:  Monday- Lift (Chest/Back-for strength 80-90%/4-6 reps) followed by 3-5mile run @ 7-8.5mph.  Tuesday- Lift (Arms/ Shoulders- for strength 80-90%/4-6 reps)    Wednesday - Long run 8-10 miles @ 7-8mph.   Thursday- Lift (Chest/Back-for hypertrophy 70-75%/12 reps)  Friday- Life (Arms/Shoulders- for hypertrophy 70-75%/12 reps)  Saturday- Rugby or long run  Sunday- Rest or long run with Hash house harriers (anywhere between 3 to 8 miles)  The shorter runs I'm burning around 500kcal while the longer ones burn up to around 1200kcal, but I thought that by receiving enough protein my body wouldn't catabolize my muscles and would instead burn the fat. If I get to the point where I'm dropping down in weight to where I don't look right or feel really weak and tired all the time I thought I could eat more then.  So far I haven't incorporated the rugby as its still winter here. As to why there's no leg day, I've acquiesced to my girlfriend since my legs have always been the strongest/largest muscle group on me to the extent that I have trouble finding pants that fit my 34"" waist and larger thighs.   What are your thoughts on implementing BCAAs? Could it help me at all? Thanks again!"
AdvancedFitness,1yw60g,banzaipanda,2,Tue Feb 25 15:28:38 2014 UTC,"Creatine and caffeine - you don't need to cut out caffeine entirely, it's just ""best practice"" not to take both at the same time. Not the end of the world if it happens.   Also, creatine cycling is popular but not mandatory - I take 15g/day for months on end with no difference in performance or ""how I feel"" vs continuing steady-state dosages. It's absorbed in the muscles, so while 5g/day is generally accepted as a standard dose, you may have to titrate upwards until you notice the desired effect. For reference, I'm 235lbs @ 17%bf and use 15g/day.   You've developed a pretty complicated routine - don't lose sight of the fact that 97% of your progress is going to come from smart programming, lots of sleep, and good food."
AdvancedFitness,1yw60g,banzaipanda,2,Tue Feb 25 18:15:02 2014 UTC,"Sorry for the double reply, but I just went back and read the rest of your comments.  Couple quick things, maybe you've already got it covered but if not...   80-90% of 1RM lifts are usually done for triples at most, most advanced lifters stick to singles at 90% because it's so close to their 1RM and therefore will take much longer to recover from than a few sets of triples at lower percentages. Similarly, 70-75% range is generally closer to a 5RM than a set of ten. If you're looking for hypertrophy, start out with a basic scheme of 3-5 sets of 8-12 reps, and disregard percentages or even baseline weights.  Hypertrophy sets are for hypertrophy, strength sets are for strength -- there's always a little crossover gains between those rep ranges, but you'll have better success if you pursue each goal individually than trying to do one pattern for everything. Most people can only metabolize about 500kcal/day of fat stores.  That number will vary a LITTLE from person to person, but much more than that, and a routine like this will require your body to start dipping into muscle stores to make up the caloric deficit.  Adjust caloric intake as necessary. Don't be afraid to lean out slowly when trying to improve multiple fitness metrics (ie endurance for longer runs, stamina for rugby, and overall strength).   Your chest/back and arms/shoulders split would be better split into pulling and pushing muscles or chest/tris and back/bis.  Your primary movements on chest and back already work shoulders and arms, so by hitting them twice in a row with zero recovery time between, you risk starting to work yourself into a hole.  Insteady, try  Monday Bench 5x5, Tri's 3x10 Tuesday Seated Rows 5x5, Bi's 3x10 Thursday OHP 5x5, High Rows 3x10 Friday Pulldowns 5x5, Rear Delts and Bi's, each 3x10   ...this gives you the same volume of work, while distributing it in a way that allows each group to be hit twice a week PLUS resting between sessions.   Finally, as a powerlifer, I'm morally obligated to criticize your glaring absence of a leg day.  Girlfriend be damned, embrace your man-thighs.  #swoleacceptance, brother.   Any other program critiques will probably be better off left in /r/weightroom, where we're a little more experienced at cross-training for power sports like rugby, football, and BJJ, in addition to the traditional strength sports."

AdvancedFitness,1yw60g,TunaBoo,1 point,Tue Feb 25 19:10:37 2014 UTC,"You can still drink coffee or take caffeine, just don't take it at the same time with creatine.  5htp, tryptophan & melatonin won't improve your sleep - they only make you fall asleep faster (which in return usually increases the amount of sleep you have, therefore making you feel better rested.)  BCAA's will help you prevent muscle loss - definitely if you workout on an empty stomach or if you do high intensity work. Also it helps on a cut to preserve muscle mass. Take it before your workouts, it's good. 5-10 gram is enough.  The reason why I say less than 1000kcal/day cut is because in general you will loose a lot of muscle mass if you go more than this. Even at 1000kcal/day deficit you will notice a lot of strength losses already... In general, the smaller the cut, the more muscle mass you preserve. I vaguely remember some research that there was a formula for the optimal deficit without muscle loss.... Can't remember it ,maybe someone else can.   Also: I got 32"" length - 36"" width pants ... and it usually is tight... If you want to be strong, you'll have to accept that you're gonna need bigger pants every couple of months lol"

AdvancedFitness,1ymtse,Awholez,8,Sat Feb 22 19:15:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I've been doing two scoops for years now...  I'll probably keep doing it, because a) I'm not interested in maximizing the ratio of synthesized protein to metabolized protein.  I just want to maximize the total amount of synthesized protein, and if 50g gets me a few percent closer to the max than 20g, I'll take 50g.  And b)  The extra (non-synthesizing) protein I take is not entirely wasted.  I still get ~5 KCal / g of energy from it, so there's nothing wrong with its contributing to my macros.  I've never taken dextrose (EDIT:  to increase MPS).  The lore is that it increases ""absorption"" of protein, but I haven't seen any studies that it increases synthesis, though I haven't looked for them either.

AdvancedFitness,1ymtse,AhmedF,3,Sun Feb 23 19:03:58 2014 UTC,"Layne Norton always recommends about 4 hours between.    It appears that maximizing skeletal muscle protein synthesis requires approximately  ~15g of an essential amino acids1,2.     It has been postulated that the amino acid leucine is responsible for the stimulatory effect of dietary protein on protein synthesis3 and 15g of essential amino acids would contain 3.2g of leucine.  [...] For example, whey protein is approximately 12% leucine per gram protein, therefore about 27g of protein from whey would need to be consumed to reach the threshold for maximal anabolism [...] It is important to note that most of these studies were done on individuals who weighed approximately 155-165 lbs on average.  So if you weigh less than this you might want to aim for the lower end of the threshold whereas if you weigh more you may want to aim for the higher end of the threshold.  [...] It is unlikely that eating another meal 2-3 hours after the first meal would be sufficient to induce another rise in protein synthesis since amino acid/leucine levels are already elevated anyway.  It may therefore be more useful to consume larger amounts of protein at a meal and wait longer between protein doses than the typical 2-3 hours that is typically recommended in the bodybuilding community. [...] I therefore suggest that one consume 4-6 larger protein doses per day instead of 6-8 meals and wait 4-5 hours between meals rather than 2-3 hours.         http://www.humanengine.com/index.php/articles/item/protein-how-much-and-how-often-layne-norton-bs-biochemistry-phd-nutritional-sciences"

The FSR was calculated with the arterialized blood precursor defined as the AUC for plasma enrichments of labeled phenylalanine over the 4-h incorporation period. The AUC was chosen to minimize the influence of the transiently disturbed isotopic equilibrium experienced after drink ingestion in the 40WP (20).

AdvancedFitness,1ynk57,banzaipanda,2,Tue Feb 25 19:36:41 2014 UTC,"Try to be a little more specific with your question. What are your goals as a ""generalist?"" Are you trying to compete in crossfit or do you just want to be middle of the road (not trying to take a jab) at everything?   I ask because ""enhance"" is a loosely used term. If you are trying to compete, you should give serious thought to the energy system demands more than what big dudes are doing to get big or what strong guys are doing to get strong. This is NOT to say that those things don't matter. They certainly do. But as a crossfit competitor I think you should focus first on the energy system demands, then approach the resistance training programming with that in mind. Hopefully I'm being clear.   I'd also encourage you to give some thought to separating the focus of each workout. Meaning, don't blend your strength days with endurance days. Or, don't blend your primary ATP-PC days with aerobic days. Don't blend your maximal intensity days with your really high volume days. I'm over simplifying a little bit here, but it's worth stating as there are a lot of people - especially in the crossfit camp - that blend these variables. I don't mean to say that it can't be done, or that you can't do it successfully, just be sure to have a plan in mind and a justifiable method to the madness. Hopefully this helped steer you in some way."

That means it can't have too much intensity or volume.  Add to that some conditioning, either at the end of the strength workouts or in separate workouts. Keep them short. They should most often be power-biased, heavy, or strengthy.  Get your skill work in. Either put some gymnastics at the beginning of your other workouts, or have a separate skill workout.  Doing each of the components separately seems to be the best approach for developing multidimensional fitness. Mashing them together (like in mainsite WODs) seems to plateau progress rather quickly."

And this is entirely the wrong place to seek info. (Sorry no links, I'm on my phone in the airport, but...) Team USA swimming publishes the more advanced strength routines Olympic athletes run. Try Google. Bam. Miracle. There's a great Youtube video of Gary Hall talking about the important of leg strength for sprinters (very different from maximal squat strength). Ryan Lochte's much more power- and conditioning-focused pre-Olympic workouts are on Youtube.

You definitely want to start very light with these and work up slowly or you could risk seriously injuring yourself.  It would probably even be a good idea to work with a strength training professional until your technique is really good (if you're in school, do you have a strength and conditioning coach?).  Even once we were comfortable with the technique, we didn't go super heavy with the shoulder intensive stuff.  We used it more to train explosiveness and coordination.  What we called ""dryland"" was running (no more than 1-2x/week), plyo work, tons of core, bodyweight stuff, jumping rope.  What we called ""lifting"" was in the weight room with barbells, dumbbells, plates, etc.  The ""double"" was a morning practice (our main practice was in the afternoon) that was 2 hours long each time, and each one had a 1 hr lift and a 1 hr swim.  I should also mention that we had a shoulder strengthening/stretching program set up by our trainers to help protect us from injury.

The thing your responses so far seems to be picking up on is that no matter what set of exercises you're doing, avoiding hypertrophy requires high weight, low reps.  Time under tension is what helps promote muscle growth, while working close to your maxes for shorter durations is what allows increased strength without as much additional mass."
AdvancedFitness,1ykdqu,Rross96,1 point,Fri Feb 21 22:19:10 2014 UTC,"I fully get that and love the simplicity of your statement.  The issue though is the same which is in swimming they always want you to be reflecting on the movements and using any amount of body-dynamic balancing to get as much of the smaller guys involved.  A lower rep, higher weight set makes that very difficult so I'm trying to key in on other ways to generate resistance/difficulty without having to worry too much about blowing up."
AdvancedFitness,1ykdqu,sigepcane,4,Fri Feb 21 22:36:24 2014 UTC,"I think you may be underestimating the CNS and stabilizer involvement required by basic compound lifts. If you have specific stabilizer weaknesses or isolation work you need to do, those are perfect for accessory work, but keep in mind that you won't increase your maxes on your big lifts if the smaller guys can't keep up."
AdvancedFitness,1ykdqu,sigepcane,2,Fri Feb 21 22:48:57 2014 UTC,"You could always do the classic Pavel's Power to the People routine.    2 exercises 5 days a week, the press and the deadlift.  Work up to a top set of 3-5 reps, then drop off 15% of that and do another 5 rep set.  Move on to next lift.  the press comes first usually.  If you go by feel, you probably won't have to worry about periodization for a while, as you are going to probably miss days, feel weak, etc.  It works great as a basic strength routine, it isn't anything fancy and is stupid simple to follow.  It also leaves you really fresh for everything else (like swimming)."

Not only does it address bilateral deficit (the phenomena that we can achieve greater loading per leg in a unilateral exercise than in a double legged exercise), it also brings in plenty of hip and trunk stabilisation, all while being a great functional movement for sports people too. Start out unloaded, then progress to a goblet hold with a single dumbbell, then to suitcase holds with two dumbbells.  Can I suggest to you a more descriptive name for the exercise though - 'Rear foot elevated split squats'. Straight away, that can explain the general idea of the exercise to someone, whereas the 'Bulgarian' part doesn't really give any information.

You have three workouts each week: intervals, tempo, and long. In between each is 1 or 2 recovery runs, which are 'guiltilly easy'.  I've had this problem since I started triathlon training - you want to get the most out of every workout, but since you are working out twice a day, you are constantly worn down. Its important to go easy when you are supposed to go easy and go really hard when its time to go hard."

AdvancedFitness,1ybyac,kayetech,0,Wed Feb 19 19:48:14 2014 UTC,"I suggest replacing squats with hill or stair running.  If you don't have an inclined surface, then you can purchase a running chute.  Charlie Francis may have been talking about building muscle when he said to rest for 48 hours.  Professional athletes work hard several days per week; they do not rest for two days straight after only one training session.    Train at least five days per week.  On your days off do ""active rest"", like walking or playing around in the pool; keep your body moving, but without exercising.  I don't know why he says to do speed training only twice per week.  Does he think Olympic sprinters train that way?  It's silly.  Do dynamic stretching slowly and controlled.  Static stretching is not as effective for sprinting as dynamic."
AdvancedFitness,1y8v87,munginella,8,Tue Feb 18 15:14:58 2014 UTC,"Consider some front lever pulls (which can be done with legs bent as much as you need). In my experience, they are excellent work with a lot of pullup overlap  Edit: gymnastics work is HEAVILY pulling based, and there's a lot of stuff in there you could benefit from. Simply chasing weighted pullups day in and day out doesn't seem to work as well as waving some of the work, and working on harder pulling exercises in tandem"
AdvancedFitness,1y8v87,phrakture,1 point,Tue Feb 18 16:33:15 2014 UTC,That's interesting that you recommend this specific front lever exercise over front lever rows or the front lever.
AdvancedFitness,1y8v87,jonhova,1 point,Wed Feb 19 07:15:37 2014 UTC,This has the most carryover to pullups - its basically a straight arm lat pulldown
AdvancedFitness,1y8v87,phrakture,4,Wed Feb 19 13:34:49 2014 UTC,"I've been in the same boat. I had a four-year stint of training focused on chinups until I could do a one-arm-chin.   There is no female as far as I am aware who has attained a one arm chin, or a double bodyweight pullup (which is harder), which would make either extremely impressive.  Smolov jr gave me a good increase (I have a report somewhere deep in my submission history). I think that, roughly speaking, the principles that work well for bench or overhead pressing apply to weighted chinning (frequency and volume).  Other than that, I had moderate success with 5/3/1 and a lot of success post-one arm chin with a texas method template where I alternated 5x5 weighted chin (volume), dumbell rows (sets of 8-10, sometimes paused), 1x5 weighted chin (intensity), dumbell rows, repeat (roughly 3 x week).  I also went through a plateau by doing a few singles of assisted one-arm negatives every week. This on top of 5/3/1 gave me 5lb/month for three months. I'd attach some weight (5-25lb) to a rope, and hang it over the bar as a pulley that the off-hand holds to give a quantifiable amount of assistance. These negatives were at least 6 seconds long, and done right they should be very taxing (I never understood how people could do reps of these).  When I could do a one arm chin, I was not able to do a front lever so I am not sure if the two overlap as much as you might think by looking at the two. IMO a front lever is closer to a ""row"" than a chin and you should expect it to carryover as much as an overhead press might carry over to the bench press (i.e. it will be individual).  I have pretty detailed logs online I can dig up, if anybody is interested. At my peak of strength I hit +105x5 @ 190, and I think +142.5lb @ 190."
AdvancedFitness,1y8v87,psicicle,3,Tue Feb 18 17:43:37 2014 UTC,"I second the Smolov Jr. approach.  At your level of physical performance, greasing the groove is a very effective way of smashing through plateaus.  I  did the Smolov Jr. program for bench press and pull-ups.  My gains were 40 lbs and 35 lbs for a total of 295 lbs and 95 lbs for 3RM (didn't test my 1RM).  I weigh 190 lbs for reference."

Try doing assisted pullups like you would goals on barbell lifts.  You can: increase the number of reps you do in a set, increase the number of sets you do in a day, and you can decrease the rest time between sets. Any three of these will help you decrease the minimum weight assist on a one arm chin up.   I use one of those machines that assist with pullups. and put a bar or chain over the two grips so that I can center one arm. After that you do pullups and progress to decrease the amount of assists you need.   The aforementioned, handbalancing, bodyweight, gymnastics, climbing, and barbell training all helped me get the one armed pull up in about 4 months."
AdvancedFitness,1y8v87,psicicle,1 point,Wed Feb 19 08:34:33 2014 UTC,"From what I gather, negatives aren't so good for building strength as they are for building muscle size. The size can lead to strength, but it's kind of a round about way to getting there. With Madcow and 531, you would have to remove weight to get higher. That's a huge part of 5/3/1, is that you have to lift lighter to get stronger. There's a big difference between testing your strength and building it. Sometimes you need a bigger volume base at a lower intensity to allow yourself to hit bigger numbers for singles/doubles/triples."

The training I used involved using an assist machine that assists in pullups or chin ups. I centered a bar over it and did sets of negatives varrying the weights in repetitions, sets, and rest times between sets until I could do sets of two at the lowest weight. I then progressed to decrease rest time between sets.   I also did supplemental training in the form of gymnastics, hand-balancing, barbell lifts, and rock climbing.   I think progression and auxiliary training are both very necessary to achieving an oac."

AdvancedFitness,1y8v87,imortales,3,Wed Feb 19 18:15:55 2014 UTC,"The scapula craves complexity of the movement they are being required to do. This results in progressions of specific movement (pullup>L pullups>etc) rather than simply adding weight, such as in a squat or deadlift.  The CNS will react more effectively with more complex movements vs. simple ones with weight added.   Here is my suggestion:  Work up to 5x5 of the following movements with at most 1 minute of rest in between sets: Chinup, pullup, L chinup, L pullup, Bulgarian, Bulgarian L, Wide, Wide behind the neck, Wide L. This will provide a great base of pulling strength.   Next is rope climbing: Please read the following post by Ido Portal, as it goes much more in depth than I would like to. https://www.facebook.com/notes/ido-portal/strength-tip-number-4-rope-climbing/255195064522481  This should help you overcome a weighted pullup plateau, and although it may not accelerate you straight to your goal, I think it could get you relatively close."

I've found personally that my DL & Weighted pull ups easily gained some weight when directly training crushing grip.    It's def a pain or even perhaps impossible to do if you're going to be hangboarding/campusing also.  Going to cause a lot of tweakyness / overuse issues.

I'd start by isolating the lats (ie. straight arm pulls) with a combination of a bent over (supinated & pronated) barbell rows, narrow/wide cable rows. Then by adding some deadlifts, clean pulls, snatch pulls (and really engaging your lats for them when you grip the bar.) And to finish off every workout I'd do some sets of pull-ups, weighted or just body weight... depending on fatigue level. Good luck!"

I mostly got frustrated because it's more difficult to measure progress, whereas with weighted pull ups you know if you've improved based on the amount of weight you lifted.  I've also been doing bicep isolation work recently because I tend to fail in the upper portion of the pull-up, where it at least feels like it's more bicep-intensive (I know nothing about kinesiology...)

AdvancedFitness,1yator,did_it_before,6,Wed Feb 19 01:52:02 2014 UTC,"MRIs are honestly not that useful for identifying the source of back pain. Sure, they can take a snapshot of structure, but the literature shows that the correlation between structural pathology and pain is surprisingly low.  That said, the alternating stresses sounds somewhat similar to what we see in functional scoliosis, but of course it's impossible to say for sure without actually assessing you.  Speaking of which, you should probably get a hands-on examination from a physical therapist. They're probably in the best position to get you headed in the right direction."
AdvancedFitness,1yator,failon,2,Wed Feb 19 05:30:18 2014 UTC,"To build on this a bit, an MRI is primarily going to show any disc issues which would really be causing more radicular (ie: leg) pain than anything else.  I would recommend trying to find a good Physical Medicine and Rehab (PM&R) physician.  I work for a large insurance carrier and my job deals with approving and managing medical care. If its a non-surgical back injury that is muscular in nature I'd start with a PM&R."

AdvancedFitness,1yator,Fartsss,1 point,Wed Feb 19 07:04:14 2014 UTC,"You should be asking us ""what are my options?"" not what is the problem. We can't tell without assessing you in person.  Since youve had tests, PTs, Ortho and they all failed you... in my opinion, you need to find sports specialists in this field or try nontraditional western medicine.  Have you tried yoga? Just doing something else basically. Their exercises are focused on balance and symmetry. Since your pain travels, maybe when you have more balanced strength, the pain will go away. What about other types of massage like myofascial, rolfing, Graston techniques? Tight muscles cause if you have imbalances. Try at home tools like foam rolling and other stretching tools. Think about mobility versus stability. You have trouble for long periods.... are you sitting at the best posture possible? My chiropractor gave me the best posture tip. Sit with feet planted on floor, spread butt cheeks/thighs out, and push your butt into the chair. This forces you to sit straight up. Your core is the most important at sitting, not just simply holding your back and shoulders back. If I'm having so much pain with exercise, id seriously think whatim doing during non-exercise that can help. Ive changes my office desk, changed the way I sit while driving, the way I sleep. If I sit at thru movies, I have a vigorous way of preparing for that! Continuing building that core strength.  I actually have problems with my neck as identified by cervical MRI. Yet my chiropractor still treats my thoracic and low back. I also have seen PT. I CONTINUE to work on my feet, knee, hip as this helps my neck. Think holistic. Treat your whole body. Consider acupuncture if you must. There is so much out there. I have also considered going to a neurologist as well. Sometimes pain can't be explained structurally.  Ultimately, my chiro gave me the best answer. Pain is a blessing. To feel nothing (at all) is worse. Our body tells us to stop for a reason, so we slow down and take care of it another way. He also gave me an example of lactose intolerance. Eating dairy isn't necessarily good, so its good he doesn't have to eat it since it causes discomfort anyway.  You already notice tightness, what have you done to relieve that? Stretching? Massages?"

AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,VetinarisTerrier,7,Tue Feb 18 11:14:57 2014 UTC,I think it would hinder your endurance training because you lowering your total oxygen carrying capacity by limiting the amount of oxygen binding sites in blood by lowering the volume of blood.  Altitude training in regards to endurance training is your body gradually becoming acclimated to a low oxygen environment.
AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,downquark5,1 point,Tue Feb 18 14:42:39 2014 UTC,Wouldn't your body also become acclimated to a lower oxygen carrying capacity (i.e. the heart becomes stronger)?
AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,eric_twinge,2,Tue Feb 18 15:03:26 2014 UTC,"No, your body adapts by making more blood to return its oxygen carrying capacity back to normal."
AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,eric_twinge,1 point,Tue Feb 18 15:50:27 2014 UTC,"Why would the body adapt in only one way? While the amount of red blood cells is reduced the heart has to work harder for the same i.e. running pace, why wouldn't the heart adapt to the increased workload?"
AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,polarbear6,1 point,Tue Feb 18 17:51:06 2014 UTC,"Yes, the heart has to work harder while the amount of RBCs is reduced.  However, this is a temporary state (according the Red Cross 4-6 weeks) and each day that increased workload is less than the day before."
AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,Monkar,1 point,Tue Feb 18 17:56:22 2014 UTC,That's a good point. Contrary to altitude training the added strain becomes less each day.
AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,downquark5,-7,Tue Feb 18 18:12:50 2014 UTC,"and what do you think happens as the amount of red blood cells increases after you've donated blood? do you think your heart just ""lol nope not gonna adapt to this better be strong all teh tiem""   if you want to be better at endurance go live in a mountaine, buy a high altitude chamber, or buy EPO..  source: im basically a cardiologist"
AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,downquark5,6,Tue Feb 18 15:17:05 2014 UTC,A neurologist AND a cardiologist?!  What a truly gifted individual you must be  Kindly fuck off with your shitty advice.
AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,rhodeislandslut,1 point,Tue Feb 18 22:03:12 2014 UTC,"I didn't mean to argue that the effect would be permanent. Just as the effect of altitude training disappears over time, the strength of your heart would go back to normal over time. That's just a wild guess of course. I'm a layman."
AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,polarbear6,4,Tue Feb 18 17:09:51 2014 UTC,"Put it this way. You lose blood, you lose oxygen carrying capacity, but the amount of oxygen available remains the same. Your body has no reason to become more efficient because the amount of oxygen in the environment remains the same. The body will make more blood to replace what has been lost. There will be no efficiency mechanism involved other than replacing what is missing.  When you reduce your oxygen available to you on the environment, your body needs to adapt to the reduced amount of oxygen available and so changes the blood slightly to accommodate the lowered amount of oxygen in the environment. Your cells also change as well.  The science is a lot more in depth than explained here. Pick up an old biochemistry book and physiology book and start reading."
AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,rhodeislandslut,1 point,Tue Feb 18 17:45:26 2014 UTC,"That makes sense to me. However, don't you neglect the training in your explanation? I mean, while the amount of red blood cells is reduced the same training-load becomes more difficult to manage for the body. The same training-load would be a new stimulus."
AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,polarbear6,2,Tue Feb 18 17:58:00 2014 UTC,"No, the same training load is not a new stimulus. The new stimulus is less blood so your body makes more.    Your body uses the hormone erythropoetin to make RBCs. You lose blood, you make more blood. You lose blood and go to an oxygen deficient environment, your body makes more blood and then more blood. You inject epo in yourself, you make more blood cells."
AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,rhodeislandslut,1 point,Tue Feb 18 18:57:09 2014 UTC,"You can also train with a mask on, to limit the oxygen flow.  Although I think that's pretty damn crazy myself."

AdvancedFitness,1y8euk,DarkTriadBAMN,3,Tue Feb 18 18:48:08 2014 UTC,"From what I've learned in regards to altitude training is live high, train low. For example, if you run at high altitudes you will not be able to train as hard or run as fast etc as you would at low altitudes. As a result, your overall performance will drop. Living at high altitudes though will give you the benefits of more red blood cells. I would not think donating blood then training would be beneficial, or whatever benefits you did see would not outweigh the negative side effects."
AdvancedFitness,1y6uf3,msharaf7,11,Mon Feb 17 23:40:13 2014 UTC,"My understanding is that above all high intensity is most important (keeping weight on the bar high) for muscle retention while losing weight.  Following similar logic as you, I've decided to run 5/3/1 'I'm not doing jack shit' with weighted chins and pull ups added in to balance my pressing movements on those days. I've been at it a month with good success thus far. For what it's worth, I carb cycle ala leangains (I'm assuming you've heard of it, but check out r/leangains if not).  Reverse pyramid training is another option I see people frequently run with great success, but I don't feel that there is much of a difference to 5/3/1. The main difference to me is that 5/3/1 pyramids up to a heavy set and RPT pyramids down from a heavy set. For me, I prefer to hit maximum intensity and then be done, thus my choice of 5/3/1 for this cut (did RPT last time, and it worked okay too)."

AdvancedFitness,1y6uf3,htown_swang,1 point,Tue Feb 18 02:43:59 2014 UTC,"I say go for it, at worst if your numbers start to drop you know it is too much and you probably need to either dial back the volume/frequency a bit or lose weight slower by upping training day cals."

AdvancedFitness,1y6uf3,Drizzt396,2,Tue Feb 18 02:10:02 2014 UTC,"Ah interesting, I'd never seen that. Maybe this is assuming you are bulking though - may be better to up the max to keep intensity higher, like you were saying, and accept the fact that progress will be slower."
AdvancedFitness,1y6uf3,htown_swang,1 point,Tue Feb 18 02:23:33 2014 UTC,"Fair enough. It sounds like your gains have been a lot more linear though, and considering your age that makes sense.

AdvancedFitness,1y6uf3,Drizzt396,1 point,Tue Feb 18 02:28:37 2014 UTC,You could add the Joker sets from Beyond 5/3/1 to give you heavy weights without changing your training max.

AdvancedFitness,1y6uf3,Drizzt396,1 point,Tue Feb 18 02:05:30 2014 UTC,"Yeah for me it was just personal preference, plus I've only be training a year and a half or so, so I'm trying to see how different approaches work for me personally.

AdvancedFitness,1y6uf3,Ballaticianaire,5,Tue Feb 18 05:02:10 2014 UTC,"Ideal rep range while cutting is around 6-7. Below that, when going overly heavy, it could be problematic and lead to injury, as you have decreased collagen/bone density; as well as lower kcal intake and thus substrate to fuel your energy demands = more probability of getting tired and having sloppy form.  Over 8 reps is also a bad idea, as those hypertrophy oriented ranges produce a substantial amount of microtears and membrane rupturing, of which your body will be unable to recover from."
AdvancedFitness,1y6uf3,marimba4312,3,Tue Feb 18 06:55:54 2014 UTC,"My experience aligns with this advice.  I still like to hit a higher intensity set of 3-5 at least a couple times per month for the major movements while cutting, but overall I found sets of 5 and below tended to build up injuries while big sets of 10+ drained me of energy very quickly and tended to carry over into the next session leading to burnout after a few weeks.  Too many work sets contributed to both burnout and injury.   I did 8 reps rather than 6-7, but I think most anything over 5 but under 10 is about what you want.   3 warm-up sets ramping toward my work weight then 2 sets at moderate intensity work weight or 1 higher intensity work set.  I would alternate high vs moderate for each movement on a weekly basis. Eliminated most accessory work down to just one accessory movement per session for the sake of not feeling drained next time.   Was able to keep this up for ~3 months at a time with a moderate deficit (~500-800 kcal deficit) and restricted carbs (150g on lift days, 50g on offdays) without injury or burnout.  That is compared to 2-4 weeks before feeling too drained to go on or suffering some kind of prohibitive injury in my previous attempts to cut."

Calorie cycling is many frequent small bulk/cut cycles in a row (i.e. daily cycling) you can accomplish fat loss and muscle gain at ""the same time,"" but you are still either losing fat or gaining muscle, but not both concurrently just cyclically.  It just comes down to an energy balance: in-out=storage. If storage is negative you are losing fat (and maybe some muscle if things aren't ideal) if storage is positive you are gaining muscle (and probably some fat too)."

Funny thing is, once you've been at it a decade like I have, and have read a lot more about it, you'll be a lot less sure of yourself, because you'll realize that there is still so much we don't know about all of it.  After all, there is a bit more than just cals in/ out, since several studies have shown greater fat loss at isocaloric levels by reducing carbs/ sugar.

Not to mention whey is significantly cheaper and easier. Alternating your sources of protein is a great idea. I have a small tub of soy protein that I'll use once or twice a week just to mix it up. So my point is: whey is absorbed quicker so try to use that after a workout, but if you feel like opening a can of tuna or eating some greek yogurt after a workout every once in awhile go for it!

No surprise, taking it sooner was better.  Again, did I mention they were fasted?  The second study was whey vs casein.  In fasted individuals.  So that is going to be pretty similar to the last study, and they found comparable results.  so there's that.  39, is on glucose, not even protein this time.  Trying to make sense of this, but it looks like they either got a breakfast or a lunch (and they worked out between).  So some sort of weird fasted comparison again.    The message is, if you are working out fasted, yeah take some protein after your work out.  A big reason to take BCAA when on a fasted workout is to help prevent MPB.

AdvancedFitness,1xxw97,zahlman,2,Sat Feb 15 18:42:24 2014 UTC,"-edit- copying the entire methods sections, but some of them on my quick scan looked like they were fasted.  Warning huge wall of text.  Highlted the portion that made me think it was a fasted study.  It well could have been they fasted, arrived, then ate, then did the study.  I will have to review that isn't the case.  36   The study consisted of the protocol shown in Fig.1. Subjects reported to the GCRC the night before the study and fasted overnight. Infusion of [15N]2 urea was started the following morning 90 min before the exercise protocol, andl-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine and l-[1-13C]alanine infusions were initiated 60 min before exercise. After exercise, femoral arterial and venous catheters were inserted, and arterial and venous blood samples and a muscle biopsy were taken. The muscle biopsy was taken from the lateral portion of the vastus lateralis muscle, ∼20 cm above the knee, by using a 5-mm Bergström biopsy needle (Stille, Stockholm, Sweden). Blood samples were collected periodically (70, 80, 90, and 105 min postexercise) after drink consumption, and a second muscle biopsy was taken 1 h after ingestion of the first drink. Blood was again collected periodically (150 and 170 min postexercise) throughout the next hour, and, at 3 h postexercise, the second drink was consumed. Blood was again collected (190, 200, 210, and 225 min postexercise), and a final muscle biopsy was collected 1 h after consumption of the second drink. .   37   The experiment was designed as an acute exercise trial with a preexercise baseline measurement and postexercise measurements for 6 h. All subjects arrived to the laboratory by car at 7 AM after an overnight fast (10 h). An antecubital venflon was inserted and a background sample obtained. The experiment was conducted as outlined in Fig. 1.At time −180 min (time 0 denotes the end of the exercise session), the primed (15 μmol/kg) continuous (15 μmol·kg−1·h−1) infusion of l-[1-13C]leucine was started. An infusion pump (AVI270 Infusion Pump, AVI; 3M Health Care, St. Paul, MN) controlled the infusion rate of tracer NaCl solution that was set to 60 ml/h. l-[1-13C]leucine [99 atom% excess (APE)] was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). All isotopes were dissolved into 0.9% NaCl using sterile techniques, and mixed solutions were filtered through disposable, sterile, nonpyrogenic bacteria filters with 0.20-μm pore size (Sartorius, Hannover, Germany). This infusion design was assumed to allow equilibration of the free leucine tracer in blood and muscle and precursor for protein synthesis after 90 min. After the isotopic background sampling and start of tracer infusion, the femoral artery and vein of the exercise leg were cannulated under local anesthetic treatment (lidocaine, 1%). Applying the Seldinger technique, 20-gauge catheters (ES-04150; Arrow, Reading, PA) were inserted and kept patent with NaCl during the experiments. On the arterial side, a pressure bag (VBM Medizintechnik, Sulz am Neckar, Germany) was inflated to maintain a pressure of ∼200 mmHg during the saline infusions. Catheters were secured with sutures, and the sites of insertion were observed frequently throughout the experiment. In five of 26 experiments (whey: n = 3; casein: n = 1; control: n = 1) it was not possible to insert the arterial catheter, and therefore, a second venflon was inserted into the opposite antecubital vein of the infusion.  Muscle biopsies were taken from the lateral portion of the vastus lateralis muscle in the exercise leg under local anesthetic treatment (lidocaine, 1%). The biopsies were taken with 4-mm Bergström biopsy needles (Stille, Stockholm, Sweden) with manual suction (4, 22). Blood, visible fat, and connective tissue were quickly removed from the specimen, after which the specimen was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. After the frozen biopsy specimen was weighed, 25 and 20 mg were allocated to measurements of myofibrillar protein synthesis and specific proteins and protein phosphorylations in the signaling cascade downstream of the insulin/IGF-I receptor, respectively.   39   Each subject participated in a placebo-controlled randomized double-blind trial with a postexercise CHO supplement and a placebo (Nutrasweet; Pl) trial. They performed unilateral knee extensor exercise such that the muscles of the nonexercised limb served as a control [exercise (Ex) and rest (Con) leg]. One week before the two trials, the subjects’ single maximal repetition (1 RM) strength was determined for knee extension and leg press, and their body density was determined by hydrostatic weighing. In addition, subjects completed 4-day diet records, which were analyzed by using a nutritional analysis software package (Nutritionist III, First Data Bank, San Bruno, CA). From this, a dietary checklist was created for each subject. The diets were isoenergetic, isonitrogenous, flesh free, and were controlled for the 3 days before each trial (dietary checklist).On the day of the trial, all food was supplied in a prepackaged form and consumed in three distributed meals. For the CHO trial, the subjects received the drink (1 g/kg glucose) immediately and 1 h after the exercise bout and consumed placebo (Nutrasweet) with breakfast. In the Pl trial, the subjects consumed a drink (2 mg/kg glucose) with their breakfast and the placebo post-Ex at the same times as CHO. Daily energy and nitrogen consumption was the same for the two trials The subjects refrained from any resistance exercise with the legs for 3 days before each trial and any form of exercise for the 2 days before each trial. They consumed meals at 0700/1100/1400 and then reported to the laboratory at 1700 (t = −120 min). A 20-gauge catheter was inserted into an antecubital vein for tracer infusion, as described by Tarnopolsky et al. (23, 24). A second catheter was placed into a contralateral dorsal hand vein for “arterialized” blood sampling (hot box at 65 ± 5°C) (16). A primed (0.972 ± 0.03 mg/kg) constant (0.977 ± 0.02 mg ⋅ kg−1 ⋅ h−1) infusion ofl-[1-13C]leucine (Masstrace, Somerville, MA) was used to determine mixed muscle protein FSR as previously described (6, 23, 30). The infusate was passed through an antibacterial filter (0.2 μm; Acrodisc) immediately before infusion. At ∼1830 (t = −30 min), subjects performed the prescribed weight training bout [4 sets each of unilateral leg press and knee extension, 85% of 1 maximal repetition (RM), 8–10 repetitions]. The 90 min between the start of the infusion and the onset of exercise was to ensure that an isotopic plateau had been achieved (23). Immediately after exercise (∼1900;t = 0), a blood sample was drawn, a muscle sample was taken from the vastus lateralis muscle of each leg (post-Ex0, post-Con0) by using a suction-modified Bergstöm biopsy needle (Stille), and the glucose (1 g/kg) or Nutrasweet drink was consumed. Blood samples (4 ml) were collected every 15 min for the next hour and immediately centrifuged and stored at −50°C. At ∼2030 (t = +1 h) a second CHO (1 g/kg) or Pl drink was administered. Blood samples were again collected every 15 min for the next 1.5 h and again at ∼0400, 0430, and 0500 the next morning. Final biopsy specimens where taken at ∼0500 (post-Ex10, post-Con10; ∼10-h incorporation time). The subjects also collected all urine excreted during the 24-h period (∼12 h pre-Ex, ∼12 h post-Ex) for subsequent creatinine, 3-MH, and urea nitrogen determination. Sample collection began in the morning (0600) of the trial (first urination not collected) and continued through to the following morning (0600). Diets were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous during this collection period. The subjects did not leave the laboratory until the final urine sample was collected"

For me study 36 is titled : The effect of resistance training combined with timed ingestion of protein on muscle fiber size and muscle strength  Here's the entire method:   2.1. Subjects and study design  Twenty-two young healthy men (age, 23.2 ± 0.6 years; height, 184.5 ± 2.0 cm; weight, 77.0 ± 2.6 kg; mean ± SD) participated in the study. Exclusion criteria included the following: (a) elite athletes, (b) those who engaged in resistance training in the past 6 months, (c) vegetarians, and (d) those who had regular ingestion of nutritional supplements (eg, creatine, protein drink, ribose) in the past 3 months. Most subjects were physically active on a recreational basis. All enrolled subjects gave written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg (Denmark). The subjects were ranked according to the maximal isometric torque of the knee extensor muscles, which was determined on a screening visit to the laboratory, matched accordingly in pairs, and randomly assigned to either the protein group or the carbohydrate group. Subject characteristics are outlined in Table 1. To keep the study double blinded, neither the subjects nor any of the involved researchers knew which group the subjects belonged to. The randomization code was broken after completion of the laboratory analysis.2.2. Supplementation  On training days, the subjects received one sachet of either carbohydrate or protein supplementation dissolved in 1/2 L of water for oral ingestion immediately before training and another sachet immediately after the last set of the training session. Subjects were instructed not to ingest anything else aside from plain water 2 hours before and 2 hours after the training session. On nontraining days, subjects were instructed to self-administer one sachet mixed with water in the morning. Each sachet of protein powder supplementation contained 25 g of protein (16.6 g of whey protein; 2.8 g of casein; 2.8 g of egg white protein; and 2.8 g of l-glutamine). Each sachet of carbohydrate powder contained 25 g of maltodextrin to keep the protein and carbohydrate supplements isoenergetic. The protein and carbohydrate supplements were stored in identical opaque sachets and heavily flavored with vanilla to render identification of the respective supplements difficult. 2.3. Training  Training was performed 3 times a week for 14 weeks. The resistance training program consisted of 3 to 4 sets of obligatory leg exercises: inclined leg press, isolated knee extension, and hamstring curls (Nordic Gym, Bolinäs, Sweden). Training was done in accordance to the principle of periodization with relative loadings ranging between 4 and 15 repetition maximums. Absolute training loads were progressively increased to maintain relative loadings at the intended level. To ensure adequate training load and intensity, all training sessions were surveyed and supervised by the authors of the study.   Which meta analysis are you looking at? I strongly believe we are reading different studies."

Subjects were instructed not to ingest anything else aside from plain water 2 hours before and 2 hours after the training session.   So this doesn't really sound like a study on protein timing; it looks like carb vs protein.  Here is what they say in the abstract   The present study was designed to compare the effect of 14 weeks of resistance training combined with timed ingestion of isoenergetic protein vs carbohydrate supplementation on muscle fiber hypertrophy and mechanical muscle performance.   While you could argue saying that look the protein group took the protein around exercise and if say the carb group is the negative control, then taking around exercise helps!  At the same time this is just looking at 1 group with more protein vs group with less.  You could argue this is for protein timing, but this single study is far from making that statement more then just a hypothesis.

AdvancedFitness,1xuumf,jrs100000,1 point,Fri Feb 14 02:41:32 2014 UTC,Check out Joel Jamieson's work on endurance. One interesting point is that he has athletes doing lots of their aerobic (general) conditioning in non-sport movements. See here. The main reason is avoiding the injuries/imbalances that come from doing the same movements all the time.
AdvancedFitness,1xuumf,bwr,2,Fri Feb 14 17:02:22 2014 UTC,"Yes exactly.  Met-con style stuff such as sled drags, prowler pushes etc is very conducive for conditioning this kind of thing."
AdvancedFitness,1xuumf,mrcosmicna,3,Fri Feb 14 19:51:17 2014 UTC,"I think the second method is the way to do it. I go wilderness backpacking for a week each summer, and I've noticed that, since I started lifting, the pack weight basically feels trivial on my back. I kind of figured that, hey, if 135 feels like nothing on my back at this point I shouldn't even notice a 65-pound pack. I never did any backpacking-specific training except for some 5k runs on off days just to maintain a little cardio capacity.  As you probably know, backpacking is 99% mental past a certain level. Dealing with the discomfort of having a pack on your back (IMO, the toughest part of doing it) for many hours isn't really something you want to train for. It's just one of those things that you have to do when the time comes. The caveat for this is that if somebody's really out of shape there is absolutely the chance they simply will not be able to keep moving after a while."
AdvancedFitness,1xuumf,beckwith,2,Fri Feb 14 13:09:48 2014 UTC,"Go hiking with a 5 gallon bottle in your pack, plus extra weights. When you get tired you can dump out the water or drink it."

AdvancedFitness,1xuumf,synchrony_in_entropy,2,Fri Feb 14 07:53:25 2014 UTC,"I think you should just lift heavy to build up all the strength that you can. Doing heavy squats will improve your endurance as a type of HIIT. Then when you are backpacking, the weight won't feel nearly as heavy and your endurance will be naturally improved. I agree with everybody else that doing some backpacking will help with your endurance though. I'm basically in the same boat as you, trying to train for a week long trek in South America this summer. Best of luck!"
AdvancedFitness,1xuumf,ABabyAteMyDingo,2,Fri Feb 14 20:08:25 2014 UTC,"Do strength training for strength. Endurance for endurance.  So, lift fairly heavy as normal. Do long walks, running, cycling for endurance.  For most purposes, weights and some running during the week with longer walks at the weekend will more than suffice. I know professional mountain guides who would not even do this.1 long walk per week with regular fitness will have you very fit."
AdvancedFitness,1xuumf,titanicx,1 point,Sat Feb 15 09:36:01 2014 UTC,"Endurance training usually would involve doing more then what you are going to be doing. For a 30 mile hike, with a 70 lb pack (why so heavy?) Lift heavy, and then lift specific. Train with 50-70lbs in a pack and walk around with it. Everywhere. Until it feels comfortable. But follow option 2, simply squat heavy, maybe do some cleans to get up and down muscles going as well."

I'm going to assume you don't have the amount of time to devote to lifting that I do, but the core of what I do that really seems to help and is as follows.  4x25 Back Squats  4x15yd. Walking Lunges  The high reps will help you build strength while keeping relatively good stamina for the hikes.  Also, it wouldn't hurt to throw in some pushups to keep your upper body in good shape and keep you well balanced.  Hope this helps!"

AdvancedFitness,1xuumf,MoreThanSummerParts,1 point,Fri Feb 14 19:52:10 2014 UTC,"When marathon training, it's fairly typical to do ""normal"" workouts during the week (think 3-7 miles / 1 hour / 3 times a week) and add in cross training of some kind on the days off. You grow the big mileage on the weekend and take a day off entirely.  I'd consider a similar schedule where you hike with the heavy pack three times a week for an hour, do a weight routine the two others, and a long hike on Saturday with the pack. For the routine I'd recommend a lot more than just squats since you will be climbing a mountain and will likely involve other muscle groups.  If you are starting from nothing, I'd skip the weights at first."
AdvancedFitness,1xuumf,munginella,1 point,Fri Feb 14 21:25:29 2014 UTC,"I always wondered about this after I got back from a mountaineering trip that involved 60lb backpacks and steep terrain. I live in Wisconsin so there really aren't too many steep hilly trails (closest one to me is a 25-min drive) or high altitude to simulate the environment I was in (Himalayas).   I know that Ed Viesturs, one of the world's best mountaineers, supplemented his training by walking on a stairmaster with a heavy backpack. For me that wasn't an option because my university's gym didn't have one. I knew that I needed to work on both endurance and leg strength, but didn't have a good way to train them both at the same time.   So basically, I ran a lot (did my first ultramarathon last year), trying to do as many trail miles as possible, and began squatting soon after. It's not perfect but it's a good start."

AdvancedFitness,1xtcxo,marky543,2,Thu Feb 13 22:10:38 2014 UTC,I didn't understand clicks properly until studying a 'clicky hip' and related anatomy. The sound can be produced by the ligament or tendon sliding over a bony prominence. If they're tight then you're going to get more of a click than if they're loose and supple. Foam rolling supposedly loosens out your tendons by acting on muscle spindles and golgi organs (two key parts to muscles physiology).  Crackling knees can be a bit of crepitus or some cavitation of gases or even just a funny congruency between two bones. My understanding of cavitation of gases though was that it's implicated more when you crack your joints and that shouldn't really occur in normal movement.

Which has had a lot of success. Basically on the day you train no food beforehand train in the evening and afterwards 50g of protein from a very lean source along with a little fiber so total cal intake is around 250-300.   Then the next day eat normally and at maintenance or higher depending on goals. The amino acids eaten post workout help hold of any muscle catabolism whilst maintaining the insulin sensitive and slightly glycogen state post workout which will use bodyfat released by your natural gh pulse at night. (To turbo charge the fat loss adding in 30 mins of low intensity cardio before any food on this day can help use even more bodyfat)

MANY things work for them that seemingly defy the Calories in v. out paradigm and make them lose weight beyond what caloric intake and expenditure can calculate. This seemingly magical weight loss appears to be normalized and fail to exist when they are once again healthy, and at this state the Calories in v. out paradigm becomes more and more relevant   and    The blanket statement of calories in v. out is currently the best guiding principle for weight loss, with more reliability when you are closer to a healthy body state. The further you are from a healthy bodily state, the more likely interventions can induce weight loss that seemingly defy the above guiding principle; getting closer to a healthy state normalizes this difference somewhat.   tl;dr: the closer you get to a healthy/normal state the harder it is to keep cutting fat.

Rises in glucose lead to the lactate I talked about in the first post, and the transportation. These shifts modulate neurotransmitter expression, example - hypoglycemia can induce hypothalamic AMPK expression, leading to NPY and AgRP expression increased and thus hunger.   As for this study, it makes sense. Lactate production would indicate glycoge depletion and glucose usage. Norepinephrine/epi induce glycogenolysis and such to increase glucose concentrations.   It also fits in w/ my first statement. Norepi/epi (sympathetic nervous system mediators) innervate ghrelin, the main gut hunger hormone, which also acts at the ARC of the hypothalamus to shift to hunger pathways, as described above."

On the other hand, eating lots of calories before a workout will provide more energy for that workout.   The overall effect is probably minor in either direction."
AdvancedFitness,1xmxnl,ephrion,2,Tue Feb 11 20:48:40 2014 UTC,"I'm with /u/ephrion here.  The workout is what modifies your nutrient partitioning that directs that surplus to muscles and recovery.    If you've got a surplus before the workout, it's more likely to get shunted into fat stores rather than muscle building and the like.  That fat may be burned for energy during and after the workout, but if you're lean enough I doubt that's going to be helpful for growing muscle and effective recovery.

It's even more difficult to determine if any given behavior is enough to cause variation that exceeds the ""stochastic"" noise in biological systems. When you add the noise of individual variation to the mix, anything that's not a massive influence gets lost in the noise.  There's a reason that very powerful computers and talented programmers team up with geneticists to do massive systems-level molecular biology.

There are several other articles (such as the one by Michael Pollan) that he links to that should also be interesting when I get a chance to read them.  I would love to hear your opinion on a couple of questions though.  Dr. Katz specifically cites two studies to support his notion that clinical trials DO exist and they show that ""cutting fat by eating more naturally low-fat plant foods have, in fact, shown astonishing benefit- such as the reversal of coronary atherosclerosis, the prevention of heart attacks"" here and here.   When you look at those studies, they show that stopping smoking, exercising, and other lifestyle interventions in addition to diet improve cardiovascular health. We have no idea whether the diet was impactful at all.  Doesn't that seem favorable for the point that Taubes is trying to make? That we have struggled to isolate and assess nutrition adequately in clinical trials?  As many interesting points as he makes in the article, it seems conspicuous of him to gloss over those studies. I would love to understand better."
AdvancedFitness,1xh77p,Breal3030,1 point,Mon Feb 10 04:21:04 2014 UTC,I would point you to Dr Dean Ornish's studies from the 80's and 90's.

AdvancedFitness,1xh77p,Breal3030,1 point,Mon Feb 10 04:50:43 2014 UTC,"So on second glance it appears that those two studies I linked to above are in fact by Dean Ornish.... (hadn't noticed that before) and a quick google search seems to show his research is mostly focused on a variety of lifestyle interventions, not solely on nutrition.  I feel very comfortable with the science behind exercise, smoking cessation, stress management and many of the other lifestyle changes and their impact on health. Nutrition specifically is the one that gives me pause.  It feels like the attitude among many scientists/practitioners is, ""Well we know this group of changes works ok, so regardless of what we know individually/specifically about the nutrition aspect of it, the research is good enough."" Would you say there is any truth to that?  Any other recommendations?   Edit: The Lyon Diet Heart Study seems like a good example of why the approach that Ornish (and other studies) use could be improved. It demonstrated better results than the AHA standard low fat diet approach that (presumably?) Ornish used in his research."

I would also review the studies of the Okinawan population.  Long lived, very healthy, highly plant based.  I would agree that some in the field rest on their laurels, but research is always on going.  I agree that there is a problem with a lack of designed longitudinal studies on nutrition, but more and more studies are being done.  I would also say some docs, due to their lack of training, aren't very comfortable with nutritional data.  There is, though, more consensus on this than the popular press suggests.  There are always going to be disagreements in the field, and people on the fringes protesting the consensus, but we know quite a bit.  But science always wants to know more, and new results can force us to ask more question (and even revisit old ones).  Just be cautious with overly sensationalized studies, they may just be hype."

I also don't mean to imply that I believe in singular approaches to health or fitness either, but it's important to understand how nutrition affects health separately. This probably isn't the right sub to continue those questions, and I get that. Some of the research that has come out in the last 10-15 years seems like it has the potential to rock our foundation of understanding for this stuff though, especially as it continues to be explored.  I am familiar with Nancy Clark. She was probably one of the first sports nutrition books I ever read and is a big part of what got me interested in the field.

Mr. Taubes provided a critique on the seemingly endless flood of observational and correlational research that 1) provides no additional clarity to important nutritional questions and 2) serves only as fodder for diet book authors and web publishers to create their next product to sell. Dr. Katz focuses on how we got into our current obesity mess, ignoring Mr. Taubes' points re: too many papers/no new answers. So, though this response by Dr. Katz is aimed at Mr. Taubes, it seems to miss the point Mr. Taubes was making.

The writer's comment that meaningful clinical trials for long enough periods and with enough people are prohibitively expensive and exceedingly difficult is spot on.  His comment that because of this, we've had to rely on lots of observational data and animal studies to come up with these hypothesis (and perhaps rely too much on them) seems fair.   His observation that thousands and thousands of small clinical trials of short duration and a small number of participants doesn't necessarily add up to the ability to make large comparisons and judgments about a topic seems fair.  He may be down playing the progress that we have made for lots of individual pieces of nutrition and health and underlying physiology, but his assessment that our ability to put together any sort of cohesive big picture at this point is correct.  It would be nice if some people would chime in with actual rebuttals to any of his points instead of, ""duurrr, he's a journalist what does he know."" I'd be interested in hearing them out.

I'll reply to the rest of your comment when I have time, but that was implicit in his assertion about ""research [on obesity] has ballooned"", and that there are ""600,000"" articles in total.   Then he goes on to say that this implies a dysfunction in the system, meaning that since there's so much of it, it means that it's inefficient.   There's never a case where a single study or article is the be, all, end, all of a question or hypothesis in any field, let alone nutrition.   You might not like that others are pointing out that he's a layperson, but that's exactly why he doesn't understand why research on the subject has ballooned, or why it exists as it does.   Moreover, he's using the word ""research"" like an all encompassing term when all research is not made the same, or on the same level  I'll reply to the rest after work, but people like him are dangerous because what they say, even though it's wrong, is more accessible or pleasing to the layperson, and so can make the lives of others working in medicine a nightmare."

Moreover, people more familiar with the field and knowledge than him can tell you quite simply what you need to do in order to not cause obesity or to alleviate it, and that's what matters.   The simple advice which people give to prevent or alleviate obesity is applicable to a large percentage of the population, and professionals work with the small percentage of patients, to whom such advice may not be entirely applicable, to address their individual problems, if such individuals present themselves and are amenable to the advice given.

To me, synthesis is the greatest form of learning, taking data and making it work in the real world.  I believe in prevention, especially in the light of the cost of treatment in the US medical system.  I hope that if you are a resident, that something will change your attitude.  I will tell you to be careful.  I have friends who do resident education, and hubris isn't always well received by your superiors.  Good luck."
AdvancedFitness,1xh77p,Breal3030,1 point,Tue Feb 11 01:08:22 2014 UTC,"I know about those very well, esp. Bandura. ;) - The research is limited however. Consider in which populations most of the interventions are actually conducted.   Did you ever interact with patients? Did you try to change their behavior by educating them? Did you measure the changes? As far as I know: You are teaching students, not helping patients change their behavior.  As we are trading advice here: You come across as extremely condescending - not helpful for making your points.   Prevention is extremely useful, if possible. But it largely won't come from education or spreading more information. It comes from strategies such as: making the good choices easier, making the bad choices harder, social pressure and changing the environment. I prefer solutions that work, not wide-eyed idealism about human nature. You are probably not very experienced in the outside world (living and working in a closed off bubble such as a university will do that to people), so I'll let it slide.  Another friendly piece of advice: Do start reading something on actual behavior change in the populations most in need of change, before you continue to spread your limited knowledge to students. It will do more harm than good. Be mindful of your limitations."
AdvancedFitness,1xhjhi,oconoroconor,3,Mon Feb 10 02:56:21 2014 UTC,"This could potentially occur due to imbalances in the body. A muscle is not going to be physically shorter (you won't lose length of a muscle) due to working out. If there is an imbalance in your body one muscle will puill harder than the other, and then it could give the appearance of being shorter (if you really are interested you can look up the concept of force pulls).  Lets say you train your biceps frequently and they become very strong, but you absolutely never do any pressing or tricep work. The resting tension on your biceps could be stronger than the resting tension of your triceps. This would result in the arm being slightly bent (flexed) at the elbow.  Another example would be doing lots of chest / pressing work, and never doing any pulling exercises. This could lead to a rounding of the shoulders because the chest muscles are pulling harder than the back muscles while at rest.  tl;dr your muscles do not become physically shorter, uneven training could lead to certain muscle groups having stronger resting tension than others."
AdvancedFitness,1xhjhi,Dwreck_,2,Mon Feb 10 05:09:06 2014 UTC,"I see what you're saying and I should have made it clear that I don't think muscles lose mass when they're shortened, just that the end-range decreases and/or the resting state is less extended. What I'm not clear on is how strengthening muscles increases resting tension."
AdvancedFitness,1xhjhi,Dwreck_,1 point,Mon Feb 10 06:08:10 2014 UTC,"I cannot say for certain the effects of exercise on resting tension, and if it is because of the CNS or not. However, it would be intuitive to think that a bigger, stronger, trained muscle will have a higher resting tension than a muscle that is weaker. Especially if you are considering the starting point to be sedentary.  My knowledge of force pulls is that often times there are imbalances due to prolonged periods of poor posture, and lack of stretching. Best example of this is that most people are sitting down for extended periods of time. These people will likely have tighter hamstrings because of prolonged periods of resting in a shortened position. If this became problematic for the person then it would be corrected by stretching the hamstrings (to decrease resting tension of the hamstrings), and also strengthening of the quadriceps.  Another common example would be having rounded shoulders also known as upper cross syndrome. This would be remedied by stretching the chest, and strengthening scapular retractors.  As far as if you should be worried about this, you really shouldn't. This could really only become problematic if you went to the gym and trained the same muscle groups whilst also neglecting the opposing forces. I'm not sure what you are specifically training for though so it is hard to say."
AdvancedFitness,1xhjhi,heart_of_gold1,1 point,Mon Feb 10 06:50:35 2014 UTC,As I understand it concentric exercise and partial range of motion movements cause you to lose flexibility. Would this explain what you are talking about?
AdvancedFitness,1xhjhi,heart_of_gold1,1 point,Mon Feb 10 14:13:03 2014 UTC,I'm asking why it happens. What is the mechanism that causes it.
AdvancedFitness,1xhjhi,newaccountforit,1 point,Mon Feb 10 18:04:23 2014 UTC,"I thought it was neurological, but I can't back that up, sorry."
AdvancedFitness,1xhjhi,newaccountforit,1 point,Mon Feb 10 20:40:36 2014 UTC,It is indeed a result of specificity of neurologic training. See my post.
AdvancedFitness,1xhjhi,newaccountforit,3,Wed Feb 12 20:12:46 2014 UTC,"The other answers are missing some major textbook neurological explanations for this phenomenon.   Muscles don't necessarily become shorter, but your ability to recruit muscle fibers will be limited to the length you train in, a concept called length specificity.   http://imgur.com/6CBLExe  This graph is from a study, showing that those who trained strength at  one specific angle were stronger at that angle than at a different angle, and the same for the opposite group.  This probably has more to do with neural function (which controls tension, or tone) than actual shortening of fibers, in that you only improve strength in the muscle length you train.  Some physiology studies do suggest this happens as the sarcomeres (sections of contractile fiber) become comfortable being shorter due to not needing to be longer, but I think neural training is a bigger factor.  So if you're only training the acute angle of the bicep curl, you will gain strength in this one range, but not at the full range of motion. Eventually this leads to a relative loss of strength/flexibility at the untrained range. You see this with guys who can curl 50lbs from parallel, but not from a fully extended elbow.  While muscle flexibility (the ability of the units to relax and the fibers to stretch) is primarily to do with the central nervous system response (GTO and muscle spindles), it's more of a ""use it or lose it"" CNS response than the traditional protective function of the gto/spindles.  TLDR Use full ROM and it won't be a problem, as you will develop strength at all fiber lengths and condition your neural signaling process to recruit the fibers at all lengths. Add in neurologic stretching if you want to gain flexibility, then continue developing strength through that ROM."

Are you familiar with Feldenkrais, Somatics, or any of the similar neuro-oriented treatments, and if so do you have any opinion about the soundness of their methods? I ask because you seem to know what you're talking about and I'd appreciate an informed opinion.  Are there any resources you like for neurologic stretching? I'm not very familiar with the concept and googling returned mostly traditional stretching methods and discussion of the neurological benefits of such."
AdvancedFitness,1xhjhi,newaccountforit,2,Wed Feb 12 23:56:56 2014 UTC,"You are welcome, thank you for taking the time to read my reply. I am a graduate exercise science student, so I'd like to think I've learned a little about the topic. It's nice to share, and in the past my comments have been buried by earlier or nicer-sounded answers or ignored by the OP, so I appreciate your interest.  I had not heard of Feldenkrais, but from what I just briefly read on Wikipedia, the idea is sound. Anything that improves neurologic control and proprioceptive function will decrease the chance of injury and improve performance. Many imbalances (such as the ones the other poster mentioned) and injuries could be prevented by better self-knowledge. I'd like to read more about his theories, where did you learn about him?  I'm a fan of anything that improves neuromuscular control, such as working a dumbbell bench press in addition to a barbell bench press, as well as all manner of stretching and balance work (neuromuscular training and proprioceptive training, though all novel training stimulus will do both to some extent).  I use neurologic stretching to refer to focusing on getting your nervous system (the GTO and spindles) to relax, allowing the muscle to elongate, rather than just trying to tug on a rubber band like many people do with their stretches. Muscles can easily reach 150% of their resting length, but our neurologic controls prevent most of it.  To learn more, search for proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation. This is a well-studied stretching method that takes advantage of the idea I mentioned above. Basically it involves contracting a muscle (the one being stretched, its opposing antagonist, or each in order) in order to trick the GTO and spindles into allowing the muscle to be stretched farther. You can safely do this on your own."

Another drill you can do is to hang at the bottom of a row and retract-release the scapulae or holding the row position at the top. You can scale this with the progression.

AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,smellybaconreader,3,Sun Feb 9 03:06:30 2014 UTC,"being skeptical is fine. i would probably be skeptical myself.  the routine is hard. but the body will adapt to it eventually. my situation was completely different and i'll explain why.  firstly, i was deadlifting 3x a week at 90% and above. deadlifting takes a lot more out of the body than anything else. in fact some people estimate that you take about 14 days to recover from a heavy deadlift. that's CNS fatigue. whenever the lower back is heavily involved, it creates tons of CNS fatigue. that's why you feel like shit after a heavy deadlift day.  secondly, your comment about volleyball being low intensity couldn't be more wrong. jumping all the time, practicing for 2 hours every day, the mental stress, and playing at a high level all lead to it being very high intensity. maybe not the definition that you're used to, but it's not low intensity. you're looking at intensity from a lifting perspective.  and yea, my nutrition and sleep was probably garbage, no denying that. but it wasn't that bad that that alone could lead to over training."

On my next base I bumped up to 185lbs in about two months, it was a huge shock and I got incredibly strong in comparison to how weak I was coming out of boot.

AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,axck,3,Fri Feb 7 13:07:35 2014 UTC,"Overtraining syndrome, medically, is just an imbalance between stress and lack of recovery. Mild overtraining is measured in days of recovery, while moderate to severe is in the period of weeks (not months).  If overtraining continues to the point of systemic breakdown, then the further conditions caused (most of which are from a depressed immune system) may take longer to recover specifically, but not the overtraining in particular.  Bootcamp is specifically designed to induce overtraining in order to fit individuals into a homogeneous mold known as ""soldier"".  Further B and A schools will, if needed, develop more specific physical profiles.  Those who develop mild-to-severe overtaining early in bootcamp will usually find themselves on medical assignments, almost always due to overuse injuries.  Most recover from the physical torment in the following weeks after graduating, as a combined drastic uptick in caloric intake and downtick in training volume occurs.  Supercompensation can take place during this period as well."

I think we all occasionally experience the symptoms of overtraining:  when our joints hurt constantly, when we lack motivation to go to be gym after setting and sticking to a routine.  When we're exhausted just considering working out, I think you're experiencing overtraining.  I think it's more subtle then we give it credit, and I think it's something you can just power through if you have the willpower.  History is full of individuals who simply worked all the time."
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,buriedinthyeyes,3,Thu Feb 6 23:05:38 2014 UTC,"I'm a top level Rower, training 12 odd times per week. In 2009 whilst still at university I was combining that schedule with classes during the day, as well as cycling 40 minutes to and from each training session to get home/to university. I was constantly exhausted, and just kinda assumed that it was due to the training load (which shouldn't have been a big deal because i've been competing at this level for the best part of a decade). It turned out after going to the doctor and having some blood tests that I had Glandular Fever, which in this instance manifested itself as the general fatigue and malaise that I experienced for months. It took 4 months of complete rest to recover. It ruined my season and severely impacted the season after that."
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,FrederickDebaucle,6,Fri Feb 7 10:03:24 2014 UTC,"I think you're incorrect on that. Non-steroid-taking trainers need to watch themselves because overtraining can have very real physical and mental effects that, if not addressed, can lead to injury."

When your joints are trying to tell you they need a break, it's because they need a damn break.  Almost all sports related injuries can be traced back to your joints/ligaments. Top athletes are an EXTREMELY poor section of humans to survey for ""over training"" because they have access to top level athletic doctors, high grade performance enhancing drugs, and are exposed to some of the most unnatural forces that can be put on the human body.  You are not built to be tackled by a three hundred pound person for an hour, ten hours a year.     I think by segmenting an already dubious issue detracts from addressing it. (The difference between overreaching and over training is largely whether or not you got injured while overreaching.)"

AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,jesseholmz,1 point,Fri Feb 7 08:35:33 2014 UTC,"Overtraining is simply an imbalance between stress and recovery.  Overreaching is when you force yourself to an acute injury or damage the equipment you are using or create a great youtube video of a ""fail"".  I am not sure why overtraining has been escalated to a major medical condition, it is simply an imbalance between training and recovery. There are many programs that induce overtaining purposefully to spark supercompensation.  Micro/macro cycle style programs used by the Soviets, as example, had multi-stage loading/unloading micro's around the supercompensation theory.  Overtraining does not require systemic conditions to be present, such as deficient immune system or suicidal thoughts from severe acute bouts of depression.  Mild overtraining can be overcome in a few days while severe overtraining can take weeks for many to recover as long as all stressors are reversed.  Of course, if any imbalance is intense or long enough, it will cascade to systemic conditions.  Punching myself in the stomach every-once-in-a-while is something that should be addressed and reversed, but does not require a panic or other symptoms such as insomnia to be diagnosed as ""something wrong"".  If I do it once an hour every day for a year, I could cause systemic conditions such as ruptured spleen and blood infections."
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,Griemak,3,Fri Feb 7 15:46:46 2014 UTC,"Yes, and my experience with that was very bad. Lost strength and kept training more and more, thinking I wasn't doing enough. Sleep went to heck, stress got higher, tired, etc. All the symptoms, and it sucked. Eventually listened to a friend and took a couple of weeks off. Even then, recovery was slow, and eventually got back into my old form and started to get gains.   Its tough to stop when you are determined to excel, but stopping and recovering is the key to success in that case."

AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,Griemak,8,Fri Feb 7 03:23:06 2014 UTC,"so this is posted in ""advanced fitness"" and out of all the replies, there is not even one mention of the term ""central nervous system"" or ""CNS"".   to truly overtrain, you'd have to be lifting at maximal effort for a very prolonged period (months) with improper recovery.   i highly doubt anyone here is overtraining unless they are at the competitive level, or they are going far beyond their work capacity after just having started training. an example of a way to overtrain would be for a novice to try to match the workload of a competitive level athlete. the athlete with years of experience and a high work capacity won't overtrain because they slowly adapted to it."
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,mrcosmicna,4,Fri Feb 7 01:44:32 2014 UTC,"There appears to be an exaggeration on both sides of overtraining: one, the time it takes to heal from it, and two, the symptoms needed before one can state they have it.  In addition, fatigue seems to be underexaggerated.  Overtraining is simply an imbalance between training and recovery.  Mild overtraining can be reversed in days, moderate in a week or so, severe can take weeks (not years or many months).  Overtraining is almost always an effect of ignoring fatigue.  Fatigue is the first sign that recovery is not at a proper level and an imbalance is forming (overtraining).  If ignored, symptoms and conditions can begin to accumulate while in the overtrained state such as lack of competitive drive/motivation, irritability, depression, soreness, early onset fatigue, inability to complete work-outs (here is your CNS), constipation/diarrhea, lack of menstruation, hormonal imbalance (test down, cortisol up).  This is the part that sucks, by the way, as being in an overtrained state can throw the metabolism from a balanced state into a ""I want to be catabolic"" with large cortisol levels being sustained.  Muscle breakdown will occur during this and is combined with muscle that is not recovered.  This can cause stalls and declined performance.  Blood tests can show overtraining.  The same tests used by anabolic users to see if too much is being used, actually.  Levels of estrogen, test, cortisol, ALT, AST, Albumin, Globulin, etc... over base can show if the body is recovering properly.  Compounding overtraining over a long period of time OR with extreme intensity can escalate the simplicity to a major medical condition (such as, but not limited to, rhabdomyolysis).  Use of stimulates, addiction to exercise, desensitized reaction to fatigue, etc... can mask fatigue and cause an improper self-diagnosis of length of recovery needed.    Recovery also has its own impact from outside sources, such as caloric intake, proper levels of sleep, if the immune system is being stressed, etc.  A combination of a PWO with high levels of stimulates, fighting off a cold, staying up late the last two nights, not getting enough water, and skipped a meal the last two days can flip someone into overtraining instantly.  Resolution?  Sleep good for the next two nights, drink more water, eat something wholesome and do a light load on today's workout.  Overtraining is most apparent in LP programs.  A simple deload usually reverses it.  When it persists to the point a deload can't ""break the plateu"", you will see most LP programs state ""move on to a split/intermediate/periodized routine"".  This is overtraining, and this is how to resolve it!  Overtraining is used in many programs purposefully.  Loading/unloading phases are specifically utilizing overtraining in order to spike a supercompensation period."

AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,jesseholmz,1 point,Fri Feb 7 16:36:33 2014 UTC,"Overtraining is a thing and has degrees.  Mild overtraining does not occur during the workout, such as what ""overreaching"" implies...  Overtraining is when this training session is about to start and full recovery has not been realized.  This can be caused by the training being too high or the recovery is too low.  Training/recover... a ratio.  If we have more training than recovery, we are overtrained.  If we have less training than recovery, we are undertrained.  You can assign made up numbers if it makes more sense:  training = 5, recovery = 4.... 5/4 > 1, we are overtrained. training = 6, recovery = 8.... 6/8 < 1, we are undertrained.  I have no idea what overreaching in this context is except a terrible attempt to try and exaggerate overtraining into some magical major medical condition, when it isn't.  It is a syndrome."

AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,RawMuscleLab,2,Fri Feb 7 07:15:34 2014 UTC,"Exactly my take on it. If you think you might be overtraining, you aren't - you'll know it.  Overtraining is a thing - but you're probably just fatigued, probably just eating shitty, probably just starting too quick.   Personal anecdote: ran Matt Perryman's 'Squat Every Day' programming while he was finishing up the book. It took me about a month of squatting 5-6 days a week to finally realize that I'd probably crossed over. Pissy mood, exhaustion while still feeling on edge, constant stomach knot, revulsion at the thought of lifting. Once I figured it out and embraced it and dropped training loads to match what really did feel like a 7-8/10 on a given day, it was much easier to deal with. I eventually tried 2-3 weeks of Deadlifting every day and hit the same wall about a week in - everything suddenly dropped about 10%.   If nothing else it was a gut check; what I sacrificed in gains (vs 531 or whatever) by going it and hitting daily singles, I got back in a toughened mentality."
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,mrcosmicna,0,Fri Feb 7 12:51:35 2014 UTC,"recovering from overtraining is said to also take months, as long as it took to reach the point from what i understand. feeling better after a deload period would make it more likely you were ""overreaching""  just as a point of reference, i've slowly been increasing my workload, over the past 3 years of ""serious"" training, and before that i lifted quite a bit but never as seriously as i should have been. i also live on a farm, so i've always added farm work on top of that, which isn't too difficult in terms of the weight being lifted, but it does do a lot for work capacity.  i've been running smolov jr for squats back to back since the summer, plus i do 5/3/1 and omit squatting, i added accessory lifts in the 8-12 rep range with lighter weight (i never go to failure, RARELY test my 1rm), and i also do a program from ross enamait called ""infinite intensity"" that i modify slightly. i also exclusively do all the farm work now by myself. it sounds like a lot, but it's really only like 1.5 hours of training at the most, some days are only 30 minutes, and i don't work with maximal weights (always 1 rep before failure.) throughout all of this, i'm still hitting PRs and making progress. this is all following the 3 weeks of slowly increased weight, with the 4th week being a deload week of 50% volume and weight.   i absolutely feel shredded by the 3rd week, i can tell my CNS is fatigued, but that's how you're supposed to feel, it's called ""overreaching."" my recovery is pretty spot on in terms of eating exactly as i should be, and sleeping as much as i should. i never drink, i never stay out late. i've slowly built up to this amount of volume over the past 3 years and i think i'm at the maximum my body can handle safely.   so to put it into perspective, an olympic weightlifter, while even using steroids, may train for HOURS doing explosive movements which directly works the CNS much more than something like bodybuilding, and they still may not have overtraining syndrome but they're certainly much better candidates than 95% of the people on this site."
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,goatchop41,0,Fri Feb 7 13:05:35 2014 UTC,"Thanks. Best response so far. Every time I hear the word overtraining I roll my eyes. Almost as much as when someone says muscle memory. There are too many micro and macro mechanisms involved to label a drop in training as overtraining. Each input and output needs to be critically analyzed when discussing training. For instance in this thread a couple of people mentioned basic training, but what about the mental challenge of lack of sleep and nutrition. I think chocking up lack of progress to overtraining is an entirely simplistic view. Let's get a little bit more mechanism focused here!"
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,mrcosmicna,2,Fri Feb 7 09:22:47 2014 UTC,"""Squat Every Day"" covers overtraining pretty well, and I'm inclined to agree with the book given my own experiences.

Consider that the gains from weight training (strength and/or hypertrophy) are brought about via microdamage to muscle tissue and the resulting repair by the body. It is easy to see that if you do not allow this repair to take place sufficiently, then the tissue is being continually damaged without recovering, affecting strength and endurance (and likely has systemic effects too).  I'd link to some literature for you, but I'm on my phone at work, so will try to check back later in the day to do that"

In the lower limb, yes they can be brought on by overuse, but it is generally overuse involving heavy tendon loading (fast, explosive movements with relatively large loads) that goes into outer ranges of movement (eg. Deep knee flexion). Pretty uncommon for most weightlifters. Check out recent research by Jill Cook and Craig Purdam, if you have a decent knowledge of physiology and anatomy.  The upper limb is a bit more mysterious and doesn't require the conditions that generally cause lower limb tendinopathies. It may be that simple overuse and relative muscle weakness is the main cause, and that's why they are so common"
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,ewsick,1 point,Fri Feb 7 07:51:32 2014 UTC,"Haha, yes. I actually am soon to meet Craig IRL.  He's a very knowledgable man.  From what I have heard, he is the best tendon physio in the world.  The cliff notes version from what I understand is that reactive tendinitises are caused by acute increases in load (ie common in endurance athletes who go from say running 20 kilometres per week to 100 kilometres per week with no progression).  I imagine going from squatting 2-3x a week to squatting 6x a week would result in an acute, reactive tendinitis.  Obviously an (osis/opathy) type problem or a degenerative tendon issue is a different story.  Plus you also have to eliminate non-tendon joint issues (ie in the knee - problems with any other passive structure other than the tendon)."
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,Calvin7658,1 point,Fri Feb 7 08:02:56 2014 UTC,"Second hand words from several titled Sports Physios in Aus is that he is the best practicing physio specialising in tendon treatment - owing to the fact that Jill Cook is solely focussing on research and not practicing clinically!  Compression on the tendon, along with high loads and insufficient recovery seems to be the ultimate triad for tendinopathy development. I can't remember the exact study, but there is one that compared compressive loads vs load increases vs compression and load increases, with the third being the most likely to produce tendon reactivity/breakdown. Granted, it was shown in rats/mice, but still gives the model some support.  I managed to give myself a very painful reactive tendinopathy by performing deep, heavy power cleans, dropping into quite a deep squat on the catch. I was only performing them twice per week, but also doing one other gym session per week (hang snatches in that one), and two sports training sessions per week. Compressive load - check Increase in load - check Insufficient recovery - check I couldn't run for a couple of weeks once it really got angry at me"

Of course I didn't know what the fuck I was doing (in terms of proper programming), so I used to do a full body workout 6 DAYS a WEEK, with ridiculous amounts of volume (3 hours a day), and I would take every set to failure (plus tons of drop sets, super sets, etc). At the time I was under the mistaken impression that building muscle was about lifting to absolute exhaustion. Anyway, I did this for a few weeks until I started getting symptoms. At first, I just felt generally fatigued and a little tired, then this progressed into tachycardia, a constant 100+ bpm heart rate 24/7, and complete exhaustion to the point where I couldn't perform basic daily tasks. Needless to say, that grueling workout routine didn't last very long before I wised up and learned the err of my ways. I didn't know what I was experiencing was called ""over training"" at the time, but I knew I was exhausted from training too hard, too often. Anyway, in hind sight this is exactly what I experienced. Let me put it this way, if you are really suffering from over training, you will instinctively reduce your training frequency/volume because you will feel like a piece of shit until you do. Yes, over training is very real."
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,djduni,1 point,Fri Feb 7 02:13:53 2014 UTC,Rhabdomyolysis is a pretty extreme example I can think of. May not be exactly what OP is asking but I have seen it from football. The guys that got it were crazy athletic. I'm talking during training camp 3 practices in one day and they were still hitting the gym as hard as ever. Granted one of the two now have a full ride to D1 but anyways.  For 2 weeks they kept up their insane sechedual until one got it then one week later the other got it. Both days they had to go to the hospital were after 2 conditioning practices and Chest with accessory tricep work. Our strength coach thinks due to so many burpees and push-ups followed by more tricep work is why their body failed. (He didn't tell them to hit the gym)
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,derpderpderp69,1 point,Fri Feb 7 02:37:20 2014 UTC,"Speaking purely from my personal experience with some science.  A few months ago I got my hormone levels checked just because I was curious.  I'm on the higher end of normal for testosterone so just keep that in mind.    I train very intensely, at least to me.  I usually do a 4 day bro split but the first exercise of every day I do a 5x5, then move on to 4x6-10, then 3x10 for accessory stuff.  It's a mix between powerlifting and bodybuilding.  I eat right and sleep right.  But I had been plateauing for a while, which is why I got my hormone levels checked.  I always felt fully recovered for at least a day when a certain lift came up.    Work got busy, couldn't workout as much, was lifting about 12 days a month instead of 16.  My gains went through the roof.  The only thing I can think of is that I was overtraining even though I felt fully recovered."
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,mal_one,1 point,Fri Feb 7 02:45:26 2014 UTC,"I'm in the middle of a recovery from overtraining.  I changed my lifestyle on July last year, and have since lost 100lbs (5'11'' @ 160lbs now). For the most part, I just cut junk food, started to care about macronutrients and daily calorie intake, started to care about the food I eat and started being physically active.  Now at my current weight, I was still on a deficit until last week, I was doing around 1700 cal daily intake in a low-carb diet (around 100 to 150 gr carb a day). Now, I've lost a lot of body fat and I'm demanding more and more from my body, I'm now running between 30k and 50k a week, doing Vinyasa yoga 5 times a week and doing a mixed routine of calisthenics and lifting 3 times a week, eating at 1700 with that much activity has caused me a lot of problems last week.  So what I'm doing right now is, I have upped my daily calorie intake to ~2200 calories, I took a week off from everything since Monday (haven't took a prolonged rest time since I started on June, yes I even ran 10k on Christmas and New year's), and getting a lot of sleep, I feel much better now but start to feel bad for not doing anything, can't wait to start again next week - I'll be more careful now, I will eat more since it seems I don't have much body fat to fuel me anymore :) and I need to nourish my body better to handle my lifestyle.  I'm not an expert by any means, but were your clients cutting while experiencing overtraining? Maybe the cause of this has to do a lot with nutrition and eating habits."

I switched my routine to lifting 3 days a week (allows me more time to sleep through out the week) with mon: chest/tris, wed: back, shoulder, bis, Fri: Legs and doing cardio 6 days, abs on non lifting days.

AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,acrimonic,1 point,Fri Feb 7 03:45:07 2014 UTC,"I work with the US biathlon team and so over training is a very serious deal for us. We make it a big point for all of or artists to get enough sleep everyday and advocate naps after the morning training session. It usually manifests itself in the form of a cold, bit usually there is a subjective ""run-down"" tired feeling before hand. Also they tend to have difficulty getting their heart rate up high during intensity workouts at the end if a high volume training block, which maybe be a more objective sign of overtraining."
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,Griemak,1 point,Fri Feb 7 04:26:07 2014 UTC,"Just so you know, I am Norwegian so I think biathlon is bad ass. The thing you said about not reaching maximum heart rate in high intensity training is actually something I have experienced. When I have been running 4x4 intervals lately my heart rate has been around 160-165 at the end of the intervals which is way lower than what I used to experience (190ish)"
AdvancedFitness,1x7z6k,porkburp,1 point,Fri Feb 7 15:07:22 2014 UTC,"That's not the same thing...  your heart is working more efficiently to the same stress.  Comparing the same work is not the same as unable to elevate HR up to it's former maximum.  Recreational HIIT is not athletic training.  What you described is increased performance.  Congratulations, your cardiac output has improved.  Reading into what was said (""heart rate up high during intenstiy workouts at the end of a high volume training block"") and adding to (implying, shoot me): this is probably a form of VO2 max training where intensity is variable.  A better example would be running on a treadmill, you are no longer able to endure the torture of upping the resistance, speed, and incline to force your HR up to a level it used to be.  Also, at the professional and possibly olympic level (maybe /u/Calvin7658 can verify?), HR and breathing (tube in mouth) are read live during the exercise and the incline and speed/resistance of the treadmill is controlled by the staff.  They will get your max HR out of you for as long as possible.  All of the body metrics are recorded and performance is measured.  Overtraining can be identified objectively this way."

In my junior year I quit swimming because my vocal cord dysfunction became unmanageable and my stress level was out of control. It took me a month to fully recover but I then decided to stay out of the pool to focus on my 3 AP classes.    In my opinion lifting is easier to avoid overtraining because you know when you start failing on lifts you need a break."

It was mostly due to not eating enough of the right foods which starved my body of the right levels of nutrients needed for my activity levels.  ended up having a big energy crash over the Christmas break where i had to stop lifting as much.

The researchers also assessed the subjects’ physical functioning [PF].
