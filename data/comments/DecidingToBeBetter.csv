DecidingToBeBetter,3e49gy,waterpanther,7,Wed Jul 22 02:09:41 2015 UTC,"Fitness is a life style and this is a shameless plug for body weight fitness. You have more functional strength in terms of controlling your body weight but you are by no means stronger than someone hitting the gym and benching 300. Lift weights, do yoga, rock climb, find hobbies. Unleash your passion on something. Instead you should be promoting healthy lifestyles instead of trying to sell a fitness style. A lot of people can't motivate them selves at the early stage in the game and the gym is fantastic for them because it forces them to leave their house and go to a separate place to work out. The bodyweightfitness FAQ is much more in depth than your post anyways"

DecidingToBeBetter,3e20lv,Fuck-Yolo-Im-A-Cat,3,Tue Jul 21 10:09:00 2015 UTC,"Cognitive behavior therapy is probably your best bet at the moment. Going to a psychiatrist or neurologist is a really solid idea.   There's some compounds on the market that help with neuroprotection and attention that I can think of off the top of my head, but the vast majority of them are experimental, so I can't suggest them to you in good conscience. If you go to a neurologist, ask them about piracetam; it's been out for a long time and is generally regarded to be safe. If the doc says that it's not a good idea, stay away from it. There's also n-acetyl-cysteine, but that's even less of a for-sure thing. I'd suggest going to a combination of doctors; neurologist, sports therapist, etc. It sounds like your neurological state is kinda shaky, and I don't want you to wind up doing anything that winds up not doing anything for you, or, worse yet, makes things worse.   You know what's safe, free, and effective, though? Meditation and aerobic exercise."
DecidingToBeBetter,3e20lv,sorinash,3,Tue Jul 21 13:29:11 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I'm sorry to hear about your predicament and very much admire your positive attitude towards overcoming it. I can very much empathise with your situation, trust me. The articulation thing resonates deeply. It's a shit place to be in, but it absolutely can get better. I'm too exhausted to respond to you at length or provide all the links and info I'd like to right now, but here's a couple things to Google:  neurotalk + PCS (post-concussion syndrome) - this should get you to the neurotalk subforum for people who are in a similar situation to you. I think knowing that you're not alone, that there are other people on the same arduous journey to wellness and happiness, is very important. There's also a fair bit of advice on there about improving your recovery, and adapting to and reducing your symptoms.   Longecity + concussion - longecity is a forum with a large community dedicated to forward-thinking approaches to cognitive improvement/enhancement. While a lot of its members are healthy people looking for an ""edge"", there's also a lot of discussion of how to manage, overcome, heal, reduce the symptoms of, etc. all sorts of cognitive and mental health ailments, including concussions - from supplement regimens, to important lifestyle factors, to brain-training exercises. This search should return a fair few threads on there that might be of interest to you.   Finally, I'd highly recommend picking up meditation. There's a plethora of studies that have confirmed that meditation causes significant growth in numerous regions of the brain, correlated with improved performance in various activities and reduction of undesirable mental behaviours. While I won't pretend to really understand how that all works, I can say that it is really, really helping me to learn to be comfortable inside of my own head again.   Oh, and um, I assume you know this, but just in case your neurologist was as neglectful as mine: if most recent concussion was like, this-month recent make sure you give yourself enough time to rest your brain so it can heal up. No work, no school, no intensive cognitive tasks, no stress, no exercise, no drugs or drinking, for at least a month. Not too much TV or video games or reading or redditting etc. Eat really well and get really good sleep. Your brain will do all its healing much quicker if you let it dedicate itself to that. It can be hard, and very dull, but it's absolutely necessary to treat your mind gently during this process.  All the best. You will get through this, friend."
DecidingToBeBetter,3e20lv,10_KG_VALUE_PACK,2,Tue Jul 21 13:47:33 2015 UTC,"This is probably a question for a doctor or cognitive therapist who deals with neurological issues. If you do have post concussion syndrome, a doctor will need to treat your symptoms.   Otherwise, keep your head up (and out of the way of hard objects - sorry, couldn't resist) and focus on improving yourself despite your symptoms. Get plenty of sleep, too. That is a huge factor in healing post-concussion."
DecidingToBeBetter,3e20lv,seasicksquid,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:51 2015 UTC,"Watch League of Denail  Then watch The Crash Reel.  Then understand that a concussion is not much different than a broken femur. In other words, it takes nearly a year to heal. Sleep is your best friend. And I can't tell you how f-d up a concussion on top of a concussion is.   And your real problem is not now, but what is going to happen when you're past 40. 7 concussions?!?! That's VERY VERY serious stuff. Are you aware of the medications that James Stewart is on? Are you aware that there is a good chance that he may not be fully functional by the time he hits 40 or 50?   If you're riding MX and getting these then stop. If you can't ride without crashing, or thinking that you can't ride without crashing,  then it's not a sport for you. Take a year off, at least, and then if and when you decide to ride, forgo the track for a trail...and keep it cool. And then get a 6D instead of some crap Chinese/Korean helmet.   Best thing at this stage...and considering all that is on the line - STOP RIDING!   And I would radically reduce your intake of processed carbohydrates and increase healthy fats, mainly saturated.  This is serious sh*t so you are A L O N G ways away from having to worry about mental capacity. You need to heal and NEVER EVER hit your head EVER again."

DecidingToBeBetter,3e0r1l,patricerut,3,Tue Jul 21 01:53:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the long ramble, but I've been going through the same thing myself. Here's what has been working for me:  Just do it. Do the hard shit. Do the boring shit. Do the shit you know, deep down inside, that you want to do. Don't shy away from things that are difficult. It's ok to do hard work. It's ok to struggle. It's ok to fail. You should do all of these, A LOT. Never say you SHOULD do something. If you feel like you SHOULD do something, but you really don't WANT to, then admit that to yourself and stop wasting energy trying to do that thing.   If your goal is to be healthy, don't think to yourself, ""I should really exercise today,"" instead think, ""I really want to be healthy, which requires that I exercise, therefore I WANT to exercise"". Then do the hard, tedious work that YOU WANT to do.  Every second we're making decisions (I'm deciding to type this out to you right now). YOU get to choose what decisions you make, and YOU get to choose whether or not those decisions align with your core beliefs. We know when we make decisions that are not decisions we want to make. We just don't listen to ourselves.  It's not that we're incapable of achievement. Many of us have just built up bad habits over the years and we have to replace them with good habits, which will also take years. One of the skills you really want to build up is grit, and you build it up by practicing; by doing rather than thinking about doing.  You say you want to do something that you care about. ""Just do it"" has a much different meaning in this case, compared to something like exercising. Doing something you care about is a long term goal comprised of many smaller tasks that need doing in a specific order. But first, you need to figure out what you care about if you don't know already. This isn't an easy task. It's a really fucking hard thing to do, but you can't THINK about figuring out what it is you care about, you have to do it. You have to research various topics. You have to do a lot of self reflection. You have to understand yourself and your skills and what you can contribute to the world. You have to expose yourself to new ideas. You have to fail. A lot.  Finally, realize that you're going to have off days, off weeks, possibly even off months or years. You will have them for the rest of your life, so you might as well start accepting and getting used to them now. As long as you refuse to shy away from the hard shit, you'll eventually be the person you want to be and do the things you want to do.  Edit: Another thing: fear of failure is a huge mental road block. Realize that you fear failure. Realize that you take the easy way out because you fear failure. You don't take risks or do things that are difficult because you fear failure. This fear will never go away. You just have to practice pushing through it, and eventually doing so won't be as difficult. Listen to yourself, you know what to do (though you may be a whisper at this point)."

P.S.  i've been reading more and more about shrooms and LSD, but my neighborhood drug dealers only sell weed, and i don't really trust their business ethic enough to provide me with shrooms or LSD in any event.  i'm curious if shroom or LSD therapy would have made, or WOULD make, any difference at this point."

I'm not sure what happened, but recently I had a epiphany and stopped judging people nearly as harshly. I've just told myself ""it isn't my business"" and move on. Cut back on social like Facebook and Twitter because there was too much negativity there. I still use Reddit to see the good and funny things in the world.

I completely turned my life around and found the good heart I always knew I had that was buried beneath all the pain. I'm now a Buddhist and a therapist and devote my life to helping others. It can be done - you just need to unlearn the bad lessons you learnt and heal from any low self-esteem or pain you are carrying."

Lied on the internet about my age and story for sympathy, spread malicious rumours about people I didn't like to keep them away from my friends, manipulated the people around me. The worst I can think of is when I spread a rumour about one girl I was jealous of, and all because I felt threatened that my friend would leave me for her.   I can't pinpoint exactly when I changed to being a better person, but I can mark it roughly around the time I left my home town for university. I grew up in a toxic environment, so I lashed out in different ways to get the kind of attention I was lacking in. Not an excuse for my behaviour, but with age, reflection and some healthy independence I got over myself and got some self-esteem at long last."

DecidingToBeBetter,3e1bk0,criki985,3,Tue Jul 21 11:12:54 2015 UTC,"First, I have to agree, there is always an adventure in your own city if you look for them. Go somewhere you've never been before. Find a new hiking trail. I am sure there is somewhere you pass by everyday that you have never stopped in, there might be something amazing there. I am always fascinated by the things I find when I go urban hiking. Second, you have a very marketable job. I could be wrong of course, but I am always seeing ""computer programmer wanted"", on Craigslist. Have you thought about changing jobs if you are really unsatisfied? Or moving? Third, if you really want to travel, there are ways to do it. They are not always the fastest, but there are ways to do it. Plane tickets are generally the expensive part, you can look into some of the work and travel programs. They are places out there that you can travel to for a week, work some and have the nights free to see where you are. Some of them are really amazing. If you REALLY want to get away for a while and have a degree you could sign up to teach English in a foreign country. I've had several friends do it and they rave about the experience. Weirdly enough there are groupons for travel too. I also like REI's travel packages too. There are restrictions to a lot of them, but last time I look at them there was one for $950 to Ireland for a week, three cities, plane ticket, hotel and breakfast. The catch was it was in November. Still sounded awesome! There many many articles and blogs  out there on how to travel cheaply. I wish you luck and I hope it's everything you want it to be! Just remember when you're travel, even when things go wrong, it's still an adventure."

Even if it is old people hiking short places, it will get you out there, meeting people, and seeing cool spots to find on your own.  From my experience, adventuring is a lonely sport. My local outdoors club does a kayak trip in some exotic place every year.   You can find small adventures every single day on foot, by bike, by car, by exploring all the little nooks and crannies of your town.  Find a way to engage with your environment: press leaves, identify flowers, collect bugs to look at and then release, or join a native plant community.   I, too, have no money to travel, but I feel more engaged with my surroundings, and really enjoy my mini adventure trips to bike around and check out places."

DecidingToBeBetter,3dxxz1,sneakschimera,12,Mon Jul 20 13:16:49 2015 UTC,"I start by focusing on me. My health, my mental state, my emotional state. It's significantly more difficult to handle difficult situations when I feel everything is chaos, so I focus on the essentials. No, money is not an essential; no, girlfriends are not an essential; no, my parent's marriage is not an essential.   For me, the first essential is health. When things are in chaos, I focus on it. Focus on getting 8 hours of sleep, focusing on doing this by going to bed earlier than I would normally (even if sleep aid is required) focusing on eating an amount that is nourishing, focus on exercising; even if it's not as intense as I normally do. I just need the minimum level of feeling healthy, I'm not doing it to build anything, I'm doing it to feel well. It's amazing how much feeling good in my body and feeling good about my health can do for me.   The next essential I focus on is my emotional state. Focusing on health does help in this area tremendously (it's easier to feel better about the world when I physically feel healthy). But when it's hard to feel great about the world, I let myself feel terrible. I give myself time and space to feel honestly. I spend time listening to music that sounds like how I feel inside and allowing myself to ride that emotional wave. I pick up a journal and express these feelings, allowing myself to write literally whatever I want to. I pick up a sketch pad and draw, even if I draw nothing but scribbles, the scribbles definitely help express the anger or chaos I feel. The more I sit with these emotions, the more I'm able to handle them. It's impossible for me to feel better if I don't even know how I truly feel.   The next focus for me is the mental state. It's so much easier to focus on this once I've focused on my emotions because it's so easy for my thoughts and feelings to get all confused and complicated. It's sometimes hard for me to tell where one ends and the other begins, but once I'm honest with myself about how I feel, it's easier to distinguish between what I feel and what I think. Perhaps thinking I need a girlfriend is an extension of my feeling of loneliness. That's good to know how my emotions taint that decision because another part of me thinks that I need to watch my budget and knows girlfriends aren't great for that. If I can be honest and okay with this sense of loneliness and find some way to express or live with it, I can make the decision to be lonely till I'm in a better state financially. For this, I give myself time to think about where I am, how I can get out of this state and what my best options are. It has to be intentional time. I plan to give myself 10 minutes before work or 10 minutes before bed just to think. Sometimes, the best option is just biting the bullet and doubling down on the work/school focus and thanking my friends for giving me space to catch my breath. It's in this space that I can truly prioritize what's important. Rent is necessary, going out and drinking with friends -while important- isn't necessary. School is nice for the long-term but I have to decide if it's necessary or not for myself. If it's destroying my life, chances are it's not. But most likely it isn't destroying my life so long as I prioritize it correctly.   So long as I focus on those three things, everything else doesn't matter. Having a clear head always allows me to think honestly and clearly; it allows me to know what the best solution is. Being honest with my feelings allows me to know if I'm thinking clearly or not. Being physically healthy allows me to feel better and think clearly. Everything else, while it feels like it matters and is more important, is heavily influenced by these three things. The other things will fall into place, I know I just need to have faith in myself and to be honest with myself about what I need."

DecidingToBeBetter,3dxxz1,scottyah,2,Mon Jul 20 20:35:13 2015 UTC,"I just lived through this about three months ago. In a three week period, my not-so-healthy relationship ended (I didn't realize how unhealthy it was until it was over and I was dealing with the consequences), it was finals week (I'm a graduate student - most of my classes have two grades, 1 paper and 1 final, so its worth a lot), my job was changing offices across town and I was put in charge of the move, and my grandmother passed away on Mother's Day.   It was terrible. I went through extreme waves of anxiety and self-doubt. No matter what I did, I was hit with another crushing incident. I was at my lowest point. To make matters worse, I deal with anxiety by not eating, so there was a 3 weeks period where I was eating maybe one meal every 2-3 days. It was bad.  I made small goals for myself to achieve. Things that I had complete control over. I made myself go to the gym. I bought a groupon deal for an hour long massage and forced myself to relax for an hour. I deleted social media so I wouldn't constantly check on my ex. I did at-home spa treatments (like face masks and whatnot). Just really small things to re-build myself confidence, because I was left with nothing.  As soon as the small tasks became easier, I gave myself more difficult things. I had been saving up for a used car, so I made myself go car shopping. The first time I went I found a car I really liked, but for multiple reasons the deal fell through. It was tough feeling that rejection, but I forced myself to keep looking. I eventually found one that I loved and luckily I was able to afford. This was huge for me - it was the first time in about a month that I did something big for me, and my confidence slowly grew. I then found out I somehow passed all my finals (and managed to keep my 4.0 GPA), which helped tremendously too.   I'm still working through all of these issues, but it's gotten better. Work has only gotten more stressful, but it's starting to slow down. I also got a raise which helps. It's summer now and I don't take summer classes, so that's one less thing to worry about. Still grieving over the loss of my grandmother, but she was in pain for a long time, and I'm glad she's at peace now. Still don't have social media accounts, but just last week I met a guy at a bar and we exchanged numbers, which definitely helps with the confidence too. I've continued working out about 3x a week (trying to build it up to 5x a week) and I'm starting to see results, which makes me more motivated to continue working out. It's a really slow process, but I see the light at the end of the tunnel that wasn't there before.  So, I guess my game plan was make small goals to slowly build up my self confidence. I had a lot of setbacks, but I slowly got through it. I also had a great support system - my parents were always pushing me to keep going, and my friends made sure that even though I was miserable, I still had a little fun."
DecidingToBeBetter,3dxxz1,MicahBaby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:13 2015 UTC,"When there's too much going on, I get some breathing room by trying to clear all the little stuff off the table.  This helps three ways:   It cuts down on the number of things I have to think about, so that my brain isn't jumping to the small stuff and wasting energy on it. It provides very satisfying small victories to bolster confidence. It gets something done and enables me to move ahead a tiny step even when my energy is low.   Another important concept is to concentrate on things that you can actually influence -- Things that require you to take an action and that affect present and future, not things that are already in the past and unchangeable (for example, the dates that didn't go well), and not things where you have no authority to change anything (for example, the parents' divorce).  And it never hurts to just sit quietly for a few minutes and decide what, if anything, needs to be done next."

You don't necessarily need to ask, just look around to see what needs to be done and do it.  Clean rooms as you walk through them - pick up trash, take dishes to the kitchen, replace pillows or throws, organize clutter.  Have your house be that little bit cleaner just because you're home.  If you get the house to yourself, take on larger projects - do up all the dishes, vacuum, or clean all the old food out of the fridge.   If there is anything in particular that is a pet peeve or sticking point with members of your family, stay on top of those things (my mom hated things being left on the floor, so I always tried to pick them up when I got home).  Other than that, if you don't want to draw attention to yourself, then do things because they need to be done and don't advertise that you've done them.  Your family may not notice that the living room is nice and organized, but they would have noticed it was a mess if you had left it.  You are saving them that stress or extra task in their day, and that is impact enough.  Good on you OP for taking the initiative."

I found out where my dickiness was rooted. For me, it was insecurities about myself and, after becoming interested in philosophy, realising that things really do not matter in the long run.    However, strutting over to the Uplifting News once in a while worked wonder for me. Learning to make meditation a daily thing did so, too. Working out and eating healthy; that way, I learned to become content with things and lessen the suffering that comes with worrying or caring too much. The eating healthy and working out helped me out with my insecurities.    Find the root of what's causing your dickish behaviour.

Not just in business, or between co-workers but also among your social groups.   Did you know a billionaire Italian was once asked if he had to start all over again, what he would do? His reply was that, he would work any kind of job to earn his first $500. With that money he would buy a nice suit and attend as many parties as possible to connect and build relationships with people.   Relationship skills are -- in a way -- scary, because you cannot always wear different hats. You can be funny and a ""dick"" to your friends, but when it comes to other relationships as well (such as professional relationships) your traits of being ""funny"" will ooze out, as relationship skills are habits.   This article goes through 4 principles that will help you build healthy relationships. It's a definite read!   The main bullet points of the article are as follows:  1. Begin with Praise and Honest Appreciation Basically telling us that we have to appreciate others and heartily praise them. The article goes further to distinguish the difference between praising and just pure flattery.   2. Give What They Want  3. You Can Never Win An Argument. Explains how you can never win an argument. It's an interesting read. Basically tells you that if you win an argument, it's an empty victory because you will never get your opponent's good will.   4. Always Think In Their Shoe The importance of ""shoe-shifting"". To build healthy relationships in any sort of setting, it's important to understand why they are saying things and what they are thinking.   Always remember ""a person's toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people.""   Building healthy relationships are definitely a key skill you need to be both happy and successful in life. I'm glad you're looking for answers and hopefully, I've been of some help!"

I wrote down all the issues I had and still have in my life and believe me, it's a pretty long list and step by step I crossed out what happened in the past (what happened in the past stays there) and everything else that I felt was just stupid thinking and worries or things I have no control of that shouldn't bother me. In the end, there was just one thing left on the list and I can focus on fixing it. The most important thing is to do it step by step and you need to talk about it. Be honest about your feelings to others and if they care they will reach out their hand and you don't have to fear rejection. Also changing your environment for a while and meeting new people or cultures can teach you a lot and you will see the world in a different angle. It helped me. If you want to talk about it PM me.

DecidingToBeBetter,3du9kl,boyslife,13,Sun Jul 19 15:12:49 2015 UTC,"Be interested in what other people have to say. Don't let them do all the talking though. Chat up people in your classes. First step is making a connection in a shared experience (shared opinion on something in class, waiting in line for the same show, etc.) Next step is hanging out outside of the place you met.  Be yourself. This will help you find real friends. Speak up, say what you actually think. You may end up with friends who see things differently but engage in conversation on the topic or you may find that they aren't the kind of friends you are looking for.  Do activities that you like. Say yes to invitations to parties, art shows, sporting events. You never know who you might meet.  All the notes above should help with dating too. Try to be friends first, but don't stay friends too long without expressing interest or you'll run into the 'not wanting to ruin things'."

We can go for a walk and they'd talk for a half hour, forty-five minutes straight without asking any questions or having any sort of consciousness that it's a little weird.  I joined many groups and was active during school. I met tons of friends there and had a great experience but as time moves on people tend to move apart.

And as you get older and leave school it's even harder to make friends because when you are a student you have a lot more time to hang out and get to know each other over a short period of time. I've had lots of friends in my life so far but I can count on 2 hands the people I am close to. One friend I made in college, one friend I made more recently through a reddit meetup, a couple friends from elementary school. That's not to say that during my time at different schools I didn't have more friends but as we age we change (hopefully!) and people either change with us or they don't. And when you are in college, you are learning so much that you are probably changing quite a bit every year.   A friend of mine once told me ""People come into your life for a reason, a season or a lifetime.""   If you enjoy any sports see if you can find a recreational team to join.

People are unreliable, self absorbed, ego driven and selfish - it's not their fault it's how we're programmed. A real friend will stick with you for 15 years. A real friend will be upset you don't keep in touch. Everyone else is just a tourist visiting your world for a bit. Embrace it. Have lots of short term friends, meet lots of people from different backgrounds. We're all alone in this world really, don't expect anyone to really get that close who's not a lover. Friends are those who stick with you when you fuck up your entire life and still hang around and you are a real friend when they fuck up theirs and don't change the relationship as a result."

Tell someone your name and offer to shake their hand, and they'll reciprocate.  If you keep it up, even an introvert (like me) can rack up extrovert benefits in the environment they're in (school/work).  I play hail-fellow-well-met all day at work and recharge when I'm at home.

DecidingToBeBetter,3du9kl,JustaThought4ya,4,Sun Jul 19 17:16:01 2015 UTC,"I noticed this with myself recently: I frown a lot. And I have finally figured out that this could be why people dont engage with me well. Because Im always frowning at them. And if Im not frowning, I think I just look super disinterested. My eyebrows dont move as if Im interested, I dont smile, my face is just sat in total bored mode.  Problem is that I just cant put on a facial expression. To be honest, and Im not trying to be a dick, I just dont engage very easily. I dont find much interesting. Its not that other people are boring, just that I dont find much interesting.  So I think a flaw that I have to work on is finding a way to find interest in things. Some mental processes that'll help me find interest in what theyre saying. Instead of just trying to process their words, actually think about what theyre saying. Try to picture the story of what theyre talking about and run through possible outcomes and what not so that I can bounce back with something like ""oh and maybe this could have happened?"", which could add a little funny or interesting thought to the conversation which we'd laugh about, or something.  So far it seems I'm just doing the absolute minimum when it comes to conversation, Im not putting any effort into it, which is why I leave myself bored and the other person feeling insulted or uncomfortable.  Also, if you really arent feeling engagement, Ive found a few raised eyebrows are an easy way to fake engagement, as dickish as that sounds. Fake smiles are easy to spot but a raise of your eyebrows with an ""oh right?"", maybe a nod of your head too, is quite easy to make look convincing, which would give the other person in the conversation more confidence in that youre engaging, and help steer the conversation towards better ground and make the two of you more comfortable.

DecidingToBeBetter,3du9kl,prpr_hrdcr,5,Mon Jul 20 01:38:41 2015 UTC,"Something Ive learned from myself is that most of the time, the other person in a social interaction is just as afraid of you as you are them. Its just that they have learned an act to hide it. And as have you. Inside, you may feel like youre super nervous, but what you dont realise is that on the outside, youre looking okay.  So what you often have is two people putting on a cool front but are nervous or feeling vulnerable inside. They both want acceptance from the other, they both want to be interesting, but theyre also both feeling as though the other isnt interested in them or giving any acceptance, due to this neutral mask of indifference which we wear to hide our insecurities and vulnerabilities.  So, to me, the key is to not be afraid. Im not just talking about people who get really nervous, who may have anxiety problems or social issues or what not. Im talking about more or less everyone, we all feel vulnerable and we all crave acceptance and interest from others.  So just deliver that for the other person, and they will feel secure and comfortable enough to recipricate because now that thwyre seeing interest from you, they arent defending their vulnerabilities amymore and can just interact with you without that holding them back.  You just have to be the first person to engage this, to show that youre intereted in them and that you want to hear what they have to say, and that you arent there to call judgment or to find a way to make them feel bad.   You ever met a person who just seemed to have everyone around them love them? And that when they talk to you and converse with you, they just make you feel really comfortable and you they just give off this really nice, friendly vibe? Thats what there doing. Theyre conquring their own fear and they arent beig on the defensive and protecting their vulnerabilities, so that they can allow themselves to show interest in you and be friendly to you.  So I think the key is to relinquish fear. Let yourself be vulnerable, dont defend yourself. And you will find, 9 times out of 10, that the other person will totally reciprocate and like you for the good way that you make them feel, by being interest in them and, on a minor level, just showing them a bit of love and admiration (but not too much of course lol).  And I mean the limiting factor is finding the right levels. How open you should be. How much interest you should show. How friendly you should be. Because, as we know, you can do too much. Im sure we've all met people who, as lovely as they probably were as people, did this too much.  But, chances are, if youre not having much luck socially, youre doing it all a bit too little, so you can afford to ramp it up a notch  So we have the goal: dont be defensive, forget your vulnerabilities, show interest in the other person, be friendly and warm.  Limits: dont do things too much or too little.  So.  Method: practice. It wont come to you quickly, but it will come to you after a while. There will likely be social situations that you'll come away from feeling maybe embarrassed or like you failed. Thats okay. This is a training process, you will have bumps. But the more you socialise and put into action your new mantras and theories and hypotheses and developing skills, the more you will adapt and naturally learn the limitations, and naturally develop your skill of making friends.  tl;dr dont be afraid, forget your vulnerabilities and let yourself be vulnerable, show interest and be kind and friendly. The being vulnerable part is the most important, IMO. Take every social encounter as a leap of faith. No one can really hurt you that much, and there really isnt much that you cant bounce back from.  tl;dr tl;dr dont give a fuck."

DecidingToBeBetter,3du9kl,aop42,4,Mon Jul 20 01:08:27 2015 UTC,"I find that the idea of ""fake it til you make it"" often works. It's not a cure-all for social anxiety, but if you think about it, if you were hired to be a character in a play and someone said, ""Your role is a confident, friendly person,"" you'd probably change certain things -- maybe your posture, your facial expression, how you engage with others. Try ""playing"" a more social person at a party -- ask yourself, how would a more confident version of myself behave? And try to see if it changes the social dynamic. With enough practice, you'll probably automatically ""become"" that person when you're socializing."

You'll meet a lot of people in both your class and in the country you visit. Take a social dance class (as opposed to competitive dance class). You have to change partners frequently, so you will end up meeting a lot of interesting people. Volunteer. I find that I meet more quality people when I volunteer over any other activity.    And keep in mind that meeting quality people is hard. Make a list of attributes you think makes up a good person. Don't push people away simply because they don't meet all your standards, but really only open up and invest a lot of time in people with whom you can grow as a person.

You don't need to warn people off it because hardly anybody will eat enough of it to be considered 'too much' before getting sick of it. Fruit is fantastic for you and should be considered an unlimited food - if you like it, challenge yourself to replace your sugary vices with it - works for me."

DecidingToBeBetter,3dnwbi,jelliknight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:33:03 2015 UTC,"1 cup of spaghetti has 42.95g of carbs, and 220 kCals. Now this in and of itself is a lot, but if you only had that with dinner, it could definitely be balanced. However, restaurants will serve upwards of 3 cups of spaghetti, amounting to 128.85g of carbs, and 660 calories! And that's without the sauce, olive oil, bread, cheese, wine, appetizer, etc!   So yeah, nothing is wrong with pasta, it's just that it's very very dense. As are other foods that you need to use sparingly."

A fundamental tenet of self-improvement is being able to look at one's self objectively. If you see a problem, you're already better off than most.   There's a couple of things that I don't see covered enough in here, and they're good rules to operate under -    ""You are the average of the 5 people you most closely associate with..."" Meaning, if 4 out of 5 of the people you hang with consistently are inherently negative you're eventually going to drop to around that same level of negativity.    If you want to improve, you should spend more time with people who are actively working on themselves, or are at least aspiring towards it. Socially, you want to spend more time with people you collaborate with, not people you commiserate with.    ""You are the average of the 5 most impactful pieces of media in your life."" Reading a lot of Checkout Line magazines isn't going to help you out in life. Or for another example, watching a lot of Fox News is either going to make you paranoid or too cynical to function.    Working on languages is a GREAT example of something you're digesting that raises your personal level. Focus on taking in more things that make you better, and they'll serve as a bulwark against gossipy, non-aspirational 'stuff' many people do on a daily basis. Speaking of which...    ""You are going to be defined by the maintenance of your routines."" Watching a lot reality shows? Get winded thinking about crunches? Hygiene not-so-good? Bad at keeping appointment times? Rejecting a lot of opportunities to hang out with friends? No matter how good you are as a human being in crunch time, what people see you do consistently is going to define you.    If you're out there doing it - or even just trying it - you're going to be seen as that ideal you are striving towards.   Regularly ringing friends up 'just because' is a good example. As is cleanliness and a healthy weight. Eating sensibly, being nice without expectation, not talking behind people's back... If you want to be the sort of person Mr. Rogers wanted you to be, it is often as simple as doing it in fair and foul weather.   Understand that what maintains you, who surrounds you, and what consumes your thoughts will be the bookends of your life's story. I want to emphasize again that you giving this some thought and seeking help is BRILLIANT, and loads better than most people who give themselves neither the time nor the impetus to do better.   Head down, keep going... Make some new friends! Do some more new stuff! You're already on your way.   Good Luck and Good Hunting. :-)"

Seems great that you're developing diversion and quiet space.  I've also found that it truly matters what kind of people who surround me.  Two things would possibly work for me in situations like this.    1 Gravitate intentionally to the people who share some positivity you desire.  2 Come up with a reminder during/before undesired behaviors that lets you make a choice instead of autopiloting to a habit of gossip or annoyance.

He could have even said ""living with four lazy people is making me a worse person"" and it would have made more sense, but he didn't.   Sure. But choosing ""girls"" instead of ""lazy people"" does not make him sexist. Generalizing about women would make him sexist. Talking about four specific people does not.   What OP thought was relevant to why they are making them worse is that they are female.   This is where I disagree. OP could have been more sensitive or politically correct in his description. However, a lack of sensitivity does not mean he's sexist. There is a spectrum, and since he does not talk about women as a group, he by definition cannot be sexist.

DecidingToBeBetter,3dmmn9,PageFault,3,Fri Jul 17 23:43:21 2015 UTC,"He doesn't say ""living with THESE four girls"" is making him worse, he says ""living with four girls.""  He's not being specific about them at all.  Like I suggested to the poster above, try substituting out the category.  ""Living with four black people is making me a worse person"" sounds pretty damn sketchy.  I don't have any agenda, beyond letting this guy know he's being sexist.  You don't know these girls either.  All we know is what this one guy is telling us, and he's telling us that these girls are awful in ways that people frequently unfairly accuse girls of being awful."

Same exact thing   he's telling us that these girls are awful in ways that people frequently unfairly accuse girls of being awful.   So if I'm ever dealing with someone who is fulfilling a negative stereotype and I complain, I'm obviously sexist/racist/etc.  By the way, you are the only one saying girls are frequently gossipy and emotional.

""This girl"" is a specific person, ""a girl"" is any girl.  ""These four girls"" and ""four girls"" are just plural ways of saying that.  If you are dealing with someone who fulfills a negative stereotype, maybe you should consider the societal influences that cause you to interpret their behavior in certain ways, yes.  And dude, I said the exact opposite of ""girls are frequently gossipy and emotional.""  Being unfairly accused of being something implies that not being that thing."

But - and typing as a person who likes to overthink things - I often find myself using this sort of thing as distraction from making those changes happen.

As the water flows, the Earth erodes, and the channel deepens. I think this is much like the pathways in our brain, and the thoughts are water. It's very difficult to redirect the pathway of the stream once it is already established. The longer and more intensely we feel disempowered, the more difficult it is to redirect those thoughts. Sometimes we need to choose a different path altogether, or somehow radically alter the channel we usually follow.  I posted a video yesterday about how to curb self talk, and I found myself feeling a lot better today. It was a simple gimmick, but it really made a lot of sense. Next time you think of a negative thought about yourself, try imagining if you would say that thought to a 5 year old. Now imagine that it is you as a 5 year old. It makes it much more difficult, and also helps you to understand the damage you're doing to yourself. You would never tell an innocent child that they are worthless or not good enough, so why do we feel it's okay to do the same to ourselves? Do we see ourselves as that damaged and far gone? I really believe that there is an innocent child hidden inside of all of us, covered by layers of bullshit, that is dying to resurface."

""Landslide, by Fleetwood Mac, is the Don't Stop Believing for people who've stopped believing""  Anyways, here's my actual answer to your question...   My goals have changed, and so the belief doesn't need to be the same.   I used to have narcissistic goals, but I've since exchanged those for goals of a more humanitarian nature. What this has done is expanded what success looks like.   To be successful and self centered, you have to make a lot of money, earn a lot of respect, or accomplish a huge feat. This cannot be done by anyone (talent, hard work, and luck are all required).   But to be successful when helping others, you only need to have a net deposit of good into the world. Sure I'd be happier if I cured cancer than if delivered books at a hospital, but the good thing about other-centered goals is that you can put value in the small things, allowing for little successes to still matter.   So no, I don't dream of world class success anymore, but that dream was poison, and losing it wasn't a bad thing.   I know that's a bit off-topic compared to losing your belief that you can do amazing things, but its what is true for me."

While the topic of the post was more about beleiving in yourself and your ability to do something great (not necessarily to be self centered, make a lot of money or fly like superman, just something that's great to you), you're response adds another wrinkle to the conversation.    The post assumes you believed in something good when you were younger.  Whether it was good for you or good for others.  It doesn't address the possibility that a past belief was narcissistic or negative.  But that's definitely a possibility.  In your case, I think it's amazing that you came to the realization to let go of those toxic goals for ones that fulfill you and more importantly others.  The world would be a better place if more people took the time to gain that understanding."

Do you have a desire to learn something new?   I was in a very low place when I moved to a new place. I had plenty of friends in college and was involved on campus. When I moved, that all abruptly stopped. I was in a rut and I didn't know how to make friends. Once I started volunteering at a local animal shelter, that started to change.  I met other empathetic and passionate people. I think people who work with animals tend to be introverted, empathetic, and generally kindhearted.  That might be a great place to start if you also love animals.  Other things I can think of: take a class of some sort: cooking, sewing, woodworking, fitness... anything you're interested in. Look for reddit board game meetups in your area. I think it's easiest to connect with people who have a shared interest or passion."

Friendships are a two way street. You have to be willing to give as much as you get. If you're saying all you have is acquaintances, consider trying to spend more time with them. It may seem awkward at first, but the more effort you put into being genuine, kind, and understanding to others, the more you'll get in return. The only way to do that, however, is by making an effort to include them in your life and spending time with them. There's a reason why people say 'making friends' rather than 'finding friends!'"

You are going to take the least conflicting/ safest route through life and die. I came to realize I'd rather just do what I want, enjoy my mind, and drop the fear, and it feels fantastic.

From experience I knew that I could fail by playing it safe, so I might as well take a chance at being open with who I am, to take risks out in the world. When I'm on my death bed and think back on the girl I didn't approach,  or the dream job I didn't pursue, how I let my past failures rule my present and future.

You know that voice in your head that makes you doubt the outcome of a situation, that creates nonexistent possibilities for you to worry about, the one that makes you feel shitty when someone does better than you at something. That's your ego, trying to protect you and prepare you for the worst. It's obsolete in most cases in modern society. As others have mentioned meditation, I'd say practice mindfulness. It helped me take a step back when my ego started acting up, and reassess my mood. If I'm going to a job interview and I get nervous, I face how I feel, then I remind myself that I AM the guy that nails interviews. Replace negative thoughts with good ones. Force yourself to smile if you're sad. At first it seems daunting but I actually kind of find it fun. You'll start to notice all the alternative routes.

Dig deep and find an organization that makes change in your community (not just sits around a table and talks about what their mandate is, but does real stuff that can actually have a long-term impact) My interests have proven to be cycling path maintenance, wildlife conservation, naturalization, bird watching, fruit share harvesting, the food bank, and Scouting, though I wouldn't have guessed that most of this would take my fancy years ago.  Through this I have met the best workplace connections, got jobs or temp work when I needed it, and met great people, and the kids and friends of great people who were more my age. All you're looking to do here is open doors, network with other active folks (most of whom are retired, yes, but they'll be very supportive of your interest and are helpful when you need) Remember: one connection leads to many others.   Also, great insta-friend tip: join community theatre.  I don't care if you can't act or are shy.  They don't either. There is plenty to do back-stage for the willing, but try and choose a job like assistant stage management or props (with help, of course) where you get to attend regular rehearsals if you can, so you get to meet people.  When people ask if you want to go out after, ALWAYS SAY YES. Even if it's just half an hour, and even if you don't get anything but water to drink. ALWAYS SAY YES.  My theatre people (and I've never been on stage with any of them) are my extended family two years later.  I may not know too much about some of them, but there's a few who I could call up in any pinch for a shoulder, a ride, or a hand.

Before that realization I probably sat around a bit too much just feeling sorry for myself - feeling lonely, but not sure where I can meet like-minded people.  In other words - I knew I had a problem, but I wasn't really sure on how to act to fix it.  (Frustrating!)  I also try and approach it as an exercise in improving my interpersonal skills.  With the different types of meetups I can one week be going to a meditation event, the next week to a programming lecture - all these are different situations in which I now try to thrive.  That involves thinking about social situations after the event and looking at things that I could have done better and identifying aspects of myself that might need work.  The internal dialogue are usually something like this:   (1) That was a different social situation and for a moment I didn't know what to say. If I'm in a similar situation again, what can I say?  (2) That conversation didn't work out the way I wanted to - how can I do better next time?

Now that you're in college, find your academic passion by taking intro classes in every single department. Then make your end goal not about getting into prestigious grad schools, being renowned expert, etc.; instead focus on appreciating and learning from the process and the failures you make in it.  The 20's in my opinion are all about enjoying the process of attaining the identity you strive for; some of us might have greater intermediate products (prestigious univ, money, etc.) and maybe even earlier and better end products, but the focus on enjoying the process regardless of what life throws at you is crucial.

DO NOT BELIEVE THOSE THOUGHTS. It does no good no matter what, even if there is some truth to them, it won't help you change if you abuse yourself over it. When you hear them, stop and say something positive to yourself. Pretend you are talking to someone else. Look at yourself from a different perspective and act like a caring friend. If you decide to eat healthier and you make a less healthy choice, don't berate yourself. Be okay with ""mistakes"" and expect them. No one is perfect. Even those people who seem perfect are so far from perfect.   Ask for help if you need it. It's hard to do things alone. Find a support group of some sort whether it is a regular gym class, something like weight watchers, friends, therapeutic type groups, workout groups, Internet groups.   You will be successful.

I can walk farther with ease. I walk regularly but I could not walk for more than an hour at a solid pace. Now I can put in 3 hours with no problems. I can also run. I went from barely jogging a mile to running 5k and soon to be at 10k level. My steps are lighter, I have fewer digestion issues, my skin is clearer, I feel stronger and sharper for lack of a better word. I hate shopping, so I cannot comment on clothes other than, I went from L to M and am on the way to S.    The two most rewarding things in weight loss involve labels and belts in my opinion. Every time I tightened my belt a notch was a victory and it was awesome. When I replaced my belt for a smaller size it was glorious. But when I changed shirt sizes from L to M I just about lost it. I have never felt so proud of myself. I almost cried because I had been stuck for so long. I am about halfway there, my experience is below.    I went from 165 and lean to 230 and fat over the course of several years. January of this year I decided it was time to get back down to a healthier weight. I found the subs below and decided to stick with a diet plan. I started slowly, then got strict, added exercises and now 35 pounds later I wear M size shirts.   It is worth the struggle, the frustration, the desperation, and the pain because the benefits outshine all of those things. The other comments in this thread are on point too. It is nice to catch an eye, to feel attractive, etc.   Check out these places: /r/loseit /r/keto /r/ketorecipes /r/ketogains /r/vegetarianketo  /r/paleo /r/paleorecipes  Disclosure: I chose low carb, thus all the paleo/keto resources. All of these subs have been influential in my journey. Some just for recipes, some for strategy, some for motivation. Loseit is a great place to start. The community is fantastic. They led me here, and Decidingtobebetter has been a great experience too."
DecidingToBeBetter,3dh8oi,oasisbsides,2,Thu Jul 16 06:44:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, here are my thoughts:   As far as work goes - Some people may disagree with me, but I feel that a job is better than no job. While working, you're networking and making connections that can help you score another job, even one in your field, on down the road. The job I have now I got because of who I knew (a guy that I went to school with); I really wasn't even qualified for the job (I am now )! And now I have my sights set on ANOTHER job that's about to open soon that I would never have heard about had it not been for the position I am in now. So I think you should take something,  even if it's just part time. Besides the people you meet, every job teaches you some kind of skill that you can take to the next place. And it just feels good to be doing something with your life instead of moaning and groaning about everything.   As far as saying something and not following through - are the types of things you say you want to do, something that you REALLY WANT to do? Take a hard look at yourself and decide what you're really interested in, and then make it a habit to do every day. If you want to learn another language, then do it! Buy some tapes to listen to, podcasts, Internet radio, duolingo, you can even find people to chat with online. You don't have to spend money or take a fancy class to learn, but you have to start. If you are unsure what it is that you want to do, start small. Try a new food. Watch a foreign film. Read books! You have to take action to make new experiences.   As for girls - I'd leave this one alone for now. Put it on the back burner. If, by chance you meet an awesome girl and want to pursue her, then of course do it, but it sounds like you need to do some work on yourself first. Most of my relationships have started when I wasn't actively looking for someone. I was simply enjoying my own life and things fell into place.   Try volunteering. There's little commitment. You can do it on your own terms for as little or as long as you want. Work in an animal shelter for a day. A lot of kind, caring people to be found there. Look into volunteering at a nursing home. Sit and talk to an old person for a few hours. They can be so lonely!!   It's hard to figure out who you are and what you want out of life. I'm 34 and still figuring it out! I just try a bunch of new things to see what sticks. I thought I wanted to learn how to cook...turns out, no, I hate it. But I did find that I enjoy cross stitch and working out and donating blood and reading. Try take a single college class in something that interests you. I took a geology course this way, met people my own age, had fun, and learned a lot.   Good luck. You can do this."

It's oftentimes a great mistake to solely rely on motivation. Because motivation is a ""feeling"" or ""emotions"" not necessarily a state of mind. Just like we feel happy and angry the next day, our feelings of motivation comes and goes.   The fundamental thing to make sure you do what you want to do is that you need a specific plan and develop a burning desire and persistence to achieve those goals.

Once you are used to that and not getting togo food all the time you can start to make variations on your recipes amd make enough to have left overs for the next day or two. What you would spend on one meal togo can get you enough food for a couple meals depending on what you get.You can find a new recipe everyday online if you look. Have something in mind for what sounds good and with a little exploration you will find yourself turning into a chef of sorts!"

DecidingToBeBetter,3dchvc,danielledudzic,10,Wed Jul 15 07:33:00 2015 UTC,"This may sound too simple, but when I notice that my life has become too mundane and habitual I add two or more extra activities to my day.  For example, if I normally drive straight to work, I will add an extra activity by stopping for coffee; by seeing unfamiliar faces and a change of scenery I am instantly happier and find myself small chatting with people around me while throwing in a much needed coffee.  Another activity I find myself adding to my day is going to the park with my dog after work; again, the new faces and scenery instantly make me happier and much more willing to converse with people for two reasons (1) I seem more approachable because I'm exuding happiness and (2) I am more willing to talk to a random person because they are obviously putting themselves out there too. You can tell instantly who wants to be left alone and who is willing to socialize with you.  These are just two examples of ways to change up your day, but the chances of meeting people who could and will change your life increase tenfold, whether by offering you a friendship, relationship, it job.  (I have been offered a job by someone at a classic car show because I had talked someone about their car, which lead to our professional backgrounds.) By not deviating from your normal daily routines, it's rare you will ever change paths and rare you will have the exposure to new people.   Hope this can help!"

Those clumsy failings are just part of the path for growth.  Don't let it bring you down.   How do you remove that weight of expectation and thought within yourself when you really do want to succeed at something?   I think as you better yourself more and more, you gain that self confidence that brings some contentment.  So you place less pressure on yourself, there's less desperation.  Expectations, like assumptions are always dangerous.  It's best to just keep yourself busy, expect nothing and be grateful when things turn into something."

DecidingToBeBetter,3dchvc,EAndersPDC,3,Wed Jul 15 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"A lot of great suggestions listed above.  You sound strikingly similar to me at that same age, including the self-reflection and introspect you already have - that's a good thing. You're already aware of what is holding you back mentally, and you've acknowledged some of the reasons why you continue to behave that way even though it may be detrimental. Those are two HUGE realizations that many people don't ever get to, so be glad that you've made it that far.  It sounds like fear in failure is affecting many parts of your life (again, something I completely understand) and so you need to start eliminating that fear by chipping away at its foundation.  I never set goals growing up, even into my mid 20s. Why? Because setting a goal means having to commit to that goal and see it through if I want its reward. And if I failed, I felt like shit. Don't be like that me - goals give a direction and a purpose to what you're doing and help guide you along a greater path. That being said...  1) Set goals. They don't have to be huge commitments or life-altering goals like ""go to college"" or ""change the world"", but tiny and incremental goals that will help get your mind and body to a better place. - If you don't ever exercise, make a goal to go for a walk or a bike ride twice a week. - If you get anxious when talking to people or going out and trying new things, read up on science behind anxiety and the biological reason it exists (seriously.. once I understood the evolutionary or psychological basis for fear and anxiety, I started finding ways around it). Then, in small incremental steps, address the areas that cause you to get anxious. -If you've never had a job and get anxious when applying for one that really interests you, start applying to jobs that you don't have an interest in but could qualify for. You don't even have to want the job, if anything you could take a trivial job for a few weeks and then leave, or you could even go through the interviews as practice for developing better interview techniques.  Setting attainable goals is a small decision that can be applied to ANY idea or discipline or area of improvement. Set small goals that you know you cannot fail at, then set some that take a small bit of effort but are still pretty easy. As you continue to do this, increasing the difficulty (and thus, the reward) you'll start to condition yourself out of that failure mindset and will realize that you are far more capable than you think you are right now.  I promise you that everything you listed above can be changed - it's all a matter of having a place to start and taking the first steps nice and slow. You'll be amazed at how quickly you start running.  Cheers, Eric"

Sticking to them is far more important than trying to fix everything at once - that's hard to sustain.   The other option is to move to an entirely new city and start over completely.

I know what it feels like to see everyone you've grew up with and surrounded by Excell and fly by you as if they had no problems. I know what it's like to have nothing to your name. 4 years later (I am 21 as well) I will transfer to University of California, Davis with a major in computer science, I have a job in a Doctors office and tied all the loose ends with my parents and have been in an amazing relationship for over 4 years now. Some times you have to look at where you are, what you have, and ultimately where you want to go. The way out for me was learning everything that I could get my hands on to since I never really had one thing that I was good at. The key was learning, you'll find how closely related everything in life is and how learning one thing can help translate to another. Community college was the path for me, but school is such a finite way of learning. Success is not about never falling, it's about how high you can rise every time you fall. I've hit rock bottom so many times between then and now but I never been so happier. There isn't a day where I cant say to myself that I'm not truly happy with my life. There's a long, looonnng, path in front of me but you can't score with out a goal.

I couldn't move out of my mother's house. I could barely hold down  a job.   I was depressed and highly anxious. This was a huge revelation to me because I often just felt apathetic. But I'd spend hours every day laying in bed, staring at the ceiling, daydreaming my life away. I enjoyed my daydreams;  I was scared of real life.   Eventually, I clawed my way out and went to college. But I was 26 before that happened and I have a lot of regrets in my life because of it.   You are not a lost cause. And you're still very young. You could easily get your life together and catch up with your peers.   You need to think deeply about the life you want to have. What kind of person do you want to be? What do you want to accomplish? Make a life list, a bucket list, etc. Get it on paper. Then, pick one goal and throw everything you have at it. If it's something like getting an education,  take as many credits as you realistically can accomplish at one time. Don't worry about any other goals, just focus on the one you're working on until you either accomplish it or are so motivated and determined that you feel you can tackle another one.   A big mistake i used to always make was to look at how unhappy I was and see a million things that I needed to change. So I'd start working out and studying and trying to be social and on and on...and things would be awesome for 2 weeks but I'd ultimately become overwhelmed and fail at everything which made me feel even worse than  I did at the start. Small, manageable goals are better. Maybe start your improved life off with something as simple (and hard!) as waking up at ""x"" time every day, no matter what. Do that for a few months and then add to it  Your life is never going to be perfect. And there are always going to be things you don't like about yourself or wish you could improve on. You may have bad habits until the day you die. But you can still create the life you want by changing your expectations and starting slow. Growing up is a process, that takes years and years and never really ends. I'm 35 now and I'm still working on myself.   I did manage to graduate college (working on another degree now). I did find consistent work, I moved out of my mother's house, I found a loving relationship. Most mornings, I wake up early to work out. I'm mostly the kind of person I wanted to be when I was in my early 20's, but it didn't happen overnight and honestly I'm still working on being a better homemaker, lol.   Take it one day at a time.

That was a foregone conclusion and I didn't even register it as production it was what was on the schedule for that day and the next step was looking for a job. Sometimes just one application a day. Create and build up a routine.  There isnt enough time in the day to accomplish what I want at this point and it feels good. Be disciplined and honest with yourself. Dont put too much on your plate at once and burn out and start over. BUILD A ROUTINE. Being self loathing and apathetic is hard and working towards what you want is hard.

DecidingToBeBetter,3dcloi,Oceanhorror,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:58:25 2015 UTC,"There are few things that you can do.   What do you really want?  You told that you haven't had any job. Do you want to get some experience? You also told that you're interested in programming. Is it something that you like? Why?  What lifestyle do you want to have? Think about perfect you in 5 years and who's this person? Does he have a job? Girlfriend? Hobbies? These are questions for you, not for answering to me because it's too personal and it can take some time. Just go and write down What you want. And who you want to be.  After you see this picture of Perfect Your Life (real life, not daydreaming), you need to create goals. For programming maybe creating some applications and/or learning these languages. For career, maybe taking some internships and finishing college. Goals are supposed to be SMART. (google it) After you have some anchors in the future, we go to the present. Now you need to create a list of what you hate in your life. You pretty much described something here. Analyze WHY you hate it. And what you can do to go from Bad mode to Good mode. (For example, instead of fapping, you would read books / do study, or instead of daydreaming, you would write them down into diary). Yes, I strongly advise to have a diary where you write daily/once in 2-3 days all your feelings, frustrations, happenings, etc. It will help you to clear up your head a lot.  And now we get tiny habits that you can implement into your life. Start small. Choose 2-3 things that you're going to do daily (like, let's say, diary, study for 30 minutes, read 100 pages a day, do exercise). It was example, your habits might differ.    So, that's the simplest plan. If you have any questions, please, ask!"

Set a date for her to find an apartment.  Your husband must be on board with this plan, otherwise, its continued enabling and zero motivation for her to get her life together.  Smiles and good thoughts sent your way.  And...you don't have to love her, just tolerate for the sake of your husband."

DecidingToBeBetter,3dapue,Erimenes,7,Wed Jul 15 00:38:23 2015 UTC,I would spend as much time out of the home as possible until you can get her to move on.  Try going out with your husband at night and when he is not around go to the library or the beach or a friend's house or anything to get out of the claustrophobic cell that has become your apartment while your MIL is there.
DecidingToBeBetter,3dapue,russianpotato,6,Wed Jul 15 01:09:39 2015 UTC,"You are not a piece of shit for feeling this way. I admire your husband's desire to be kind and patient with his mother; however, enabling her is not the most loving thing he can be doing for her at this time, in my opinion. Your needs are just as important as anyone else's, and your MIL is not your responsibility. If I were in your shoes, I'd like to think I would try to take a step back from the situation (stay at a family member's house for a weekend or something) to give myself room to breath. Then, perhaps with a clear head, I could approach my husband in love and tell him that this living situation is unacceptable for me. Maybe I would propose a solution (a FIRM move-out date).   There is absolutely nothing wrong with setting healthy boundaries. It sounds like your boundaries are being erased or dismissed. If I were in your shoes, I would feel the same way."
DecidingToBeBetter,3dapue,Slorgasm,7,Wed Jul 15 02:20:38 2015 UTC,"This is something that I've learned, as I've been in your situation.  Anger is an addiction.    To get yourself out of this spiral, you're going to have to have a lot of willpower to even start.  You have to care about the people around you more than your petty grudge.  That's how I started.  I care about my wife enough to dim the importance of bitching and making her life hell every chance I get.   That's the focus, and that's the only reason.  But I did it.  For her.    Think of your brain like a radio dial with positivity on one side and bullshit on the other.  Right now, the dial is dead nuts buried on the bullshit side, so that's all you are going to get.  Bullshit, repeating in your head, over and over, day in day out, until you end up breaking something really important, like your marriage.  If you let it...    The thing is, if you keep feeding yourself bullshit, it's never going to change.  If you care at all about your relationship with your husband, then you need to change.  That's all there is to it, you need to.  For him, because he is more important, no matter what.  No more excuses, no more ""but she did this or said that.""  No.  More.  No matter what.  We all have this little thing called willpower that allows us to force ourselves to do things that we don't want to do.  It's time to use it.    I know you really want to freak out every time you see her.  I know you really want to tell your husband every thing she did today.  I know you really want to just give up and fuck everything.  But this isn't about what you really want anymore, it's about him, because he is more important.  And that is why you will force yourself to shut the fuck up and stop making your husband's life hell.  Because he is more important.    Once you take that first step, and decide to be better than this, no matter what, you will start to repair the damage you've already done.  Once you've built some willpower and stifled the negativity for a time, you'll be able to force yourself to start saying positive things instead of negative bullshit, and that radio dial?  It'll start turning toward the positive side, and you're mind will stop vomiting negativity all over you and your husband.    You have to focus on the fact that freaking out and bitching are NOT ALLOWED ANY LONGER.  No Matter What she does, or doesn't do, or says, or looks like.  It needs to be on the front burner in your mind, like a horse with blinders, at all times.  You need to force yourself, for him, because he is more important.  Just like you are not allowed to freak out on a boss at work, or a teacher, or your parents-  you will not allow yourself to freak out on your husband any more.    As of right now, this is no longer a problem with your mother in law.  This is your problem with anger and resentment and rage.  And for your husband, because he is your world, you will force yourself to change."
DecidingToBeBetter,3dapue,thejustducky1,2,Wed Jul 15 08:49:52 2015 UTC,"OP, this is some great advice. It may not be what you want to hear right now, because you seem to feel powerless and angry. But really, you'll get power and peace if you follow this advice. You are concerned about the impact of your feelings on your husband and the rest of the family. Then act accordingly.   Talk to your husband about setting boundaries. You, he and Mom sit down and agree a date for a move out. This lets her plan and lets you feel reassured that this all will end. Make the end date non-negotiable. Do this in value-neutral language. Point out that you understand that sleeping on a couch is less than ideal for all of you, and agree what (if anything) you and husbo are willing to do to help her move. But move she must.   Then you do as advised and stop spewing negativity. Journal these feelings. Spend less time at home. Take up boxing. Whatever lets you vent the anger on someone other than your husband or his mother. Venting to your husband or his mother makes you feel bad, makes you describe yourself as a monster, etc. So just choose the high road here. It will help you in the long term."
DecidingToBeBetter,3dapue,YankshireRose,4,Wed Jul 15 12:34:30 2015 UTC,"Because you've posted to ""DecidingToBeBetter"", I will focus on you rather than the MIL. She's made bad choices in life and seems to be quite annoying. My grandmother is a similar, highly dependent, lazy, selfish person, with a certain ""learned helplessness"" about her that she brings out whenever my dad is around. She lives with my parents full time. It drives my mother up the wall. I've watched mum grow so bitter over the years. Don't let it happen to you.  Remember this - you choose your emotions. Even though this doesn't feel true, a large part of our personality and demeanor in life is based on how we choose to react to life. You say you're reacting like a crazy monster - just take a deep breath and find something else to do. Don't dwell on these feelings for they will just eat you up from the inside. The feelings + the guilt you feel for having these feelings will turn you crazy.  When monstrous thoughts come to mind,   Put on headphones and listen to your favourite music Take up a hobby (I like to crochet!) Go for a walk/to the gym/exercise.   There's lots to do.  Also, ask your MIL to help around the house. Because you work, let her cook you and husband dinner. You can even choose what is cooked. It may not be tasty, but it's a task off your plate.  She could also help with laundry or cleaning.   Make sure you ask her to do things without being rude to her (I only add this because my mum seems incapable of this) but you must also be direct. ""Hey MIL, could you do the laundry today? It would really help us out. I've placed the dirty pile of clothes in the basket already."" (So you don't end up with pink-whites.)  These changes will take a lot of effort on your part but they will make you a better person. You're not doing this for the MIL, you're doing it for your own sanity and your marriage. YOU make the change.  I hope this helps. Sending many warm wishes your way."
DecidingToBeBetter,3dapue,jump_bunny,6,Wed Jul 15 05:47:06 2015 UTC,"A wonderful woman at a new age store once told me this when I complained that a coworker was making me miserable and negative, ""Take a deep breath and then ask the Universe to take her towards her happiness. You can send her good vibes while still hoping she gets out of your hair.""   I share that with you so that you can see that wanting her out does not equal you being an asshole. It can be a kind emotion if you reframe it. The positive side of the coin is that you want to steer her in the direction of self sufficiency and independence. Also, that her moving on to something new brings you back into equilibrium so that you can be a good partner to your husband again. All fair, all kind. Hope that helps!"
DecidingToBeBetter,3dapue,ms_abominable,3,Wed Jul 15 04:31:42 2015 UTC,"This is a sticky situation and I can only imagine how tough it is to have your MIL living with you with ZERO notice. Not fair. I had a MIL long ago. She was a saint, for reals. She joined a convent when she was 19 because she had cancer and wanted to give herself to her god before she died....but she lived. She stayed there for 20 yrs and became a teacher. She decided she wanted to leave the convent after all those years because that cancer went away and she wanted to be a mother. So, she married and had 2 beautiful boys that she raised, with more cancer popping up every few years. When her youngest reached 18, the cancer began to win. That is when I started dating my husband. I knew her for about 2 mths. I chose to stick around have been with my husband for almost 20 yrs now. I dont have and never did have a real MIL. She is only in my imagination. I wish she was here, even with all the horror stories I hear from others about their crazy MILs. I suggest you find a way to pitty your MIL deeply, like from your gut. Look at her and feel very sorry for her, and think about all the what ifs and how bad those would be. Try hard to find a place in your heart for her, even in your imagination. Life is short, things change, people regret things, we all make poor choices. Just make choices that you can live with yourself making. You are not a bad person for feeling like you do about her, but you are obviously the bigger person here and she is a pretty sorry human right now in her life. She must have been great one time because she managed to raise a great guy, right? Thats gotta be worth something! Take care of yourself, update us soon."

DecidingToBeBetter,3dapue,DaEnvironmentSelects,2,Tue Jul 14 23:04:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know what this woman does to get on your nerves so much... but I don't know if it actually matters.   2 things: Try to form a game plan to smooth a transition out of your apartment (help look for a new place/job/etc).  Of course, you're not obligated to help in anyway, but it would probably be in your best interest to do so.    If you can't communicate with her in a civil way, make sure you are communicating with your husband and letting him know your needs.  You don't have to be nice to your MIL, but don't be mean.  It helps no one.  Are there ways you can get out of the house?  Dates with the husband or hanging out with friends?    It sounds like to me that you are frustrated that you have to even deal with this in the first place and you don't want to change your routine for her sake.  I understand this... but you are in this situation so try and make the best out of it."
DecidingToBeBetter,3dapue,BrobearBerbil,2,Wed Jul 15 05:12:28 2015 UTC,"When I've had insufferable roommates or coworkers, I've noticed a change of heart can occur when we spend time together in a third place or event outside of our routine where we didn't expect anything and ended up feeling free of our current perception of each other.   You're biding time right now and this won't be forever. I would take her out to do something you'd both enjoy and just concede that personal time lost. Think of it like the moment at the airport where you give in to the fact that your plane is canceled and you suddenly find a way to enjoy browsing the shops for books.  Take her to a nice movie or to get hair done together. Usually when you give up on personal time and invest a couple hours, the other off time hours with people are more free as they've had their fill and like to be alone later more too.   My mom had an incredibly difficult MIL, but decided to be the one in the family that was extra kind to her and not phased by her behavior. This softened her MIL a lot over time and made her a much easier person to deal with for everyone later."

Will she contribute to the expense of a larger apartment, if you as a family decide this?  Will she agree to seeing someone about her addiction?  If not, who will she let help manage her money to move her forward in life and back out on her own instead of a place of dependency?  What does she say about this aspect?  If she is going to remain stuck in her addiction because that's not going to be good for your marriage if she continues to live with you.  Does she have the same goals for your family and marriage as you and your husband?  How is she going to help the family and not just herself?  Set a time limit and help her link to social services or a live in situation with a roommate where the rent money is deducted via automatic bank transfer first.  Speak about these nuts and bolts issues without anger and in a way that lets her know you both want the best for her and your family.  If she isn't willing to work it out or on her issues starting now ask her what should happen.  Good luck, it's difficult dealing with a close family member's addiction who tells you at the last moment they need your extreme effort to 'save' them. Best to you, OP."
DecidingToBeBetter,3dapue,DaEnvironmentSelects,4,Wed Jul 15 17:01:05 2015 UTC,"I am sorry, but she will likely not move out.  Waiting till last moment to move in, giving no choice? Having apartment and then suddenly loosing it? I call bullshit. She wants free place to stay in, not new apartment - she likely has shitty credit and no money to pay for it anyway. She will not get new aparatment in foreseable future - but she will make you believe that is is always just around corner. Offer her to come with her to take a look at prospective apartments - if she will not want you to come, you know what is happening. If she lets you come, get contact for apartment owner and if she says that it did not work out, give him a call to learn how it really was. I would not be suprised if she told him that she does not want that apartment.   husband tells me that she's just a scared old women; she hates that she's upsetting me; she's doing everything she can to find an apartment; she just wants me to like her and she knows i hate her, and it makes both of them so very sad.   She knows you hate her and she is using that against you. To make you miserable and as a emotional blackmail. To tear her son and you apart. She could very well be great people manipulator.  She WILL use this if you eventually get your courage to stand your ground and kick her out. That she is poor frail woman and you the monster. DO NOT BELIEVE HER. She has swapped who is the victim and who is the monster.  You do not need patience, you need toxic person away from your life. You do not need to enable someone to destroy themselves and your family.  You need to know what she is really doing to hunt for new apartment, is she is still gambling, whether this has happened to your husband before (her moving in after financial troubles) and if it is likely to happen again. Does she even have a job?  Once you know, you will know whether you need to get away or stay and make your stand. Because if this is pattern that will repeat, you will have to make your husband choose Her or You. Either way, you would get your freedom and life back."

DecidingToBeBetter,3d7ufc,Titty123,9,Tue Jul 14 04:50:24 2015 UTC,"This is a situation where you would probably want to work on filtering what you say before hitting the actual problem.  That can at least help in the short term.  As for the actual issue at hand, I would reflect on why you automatically look at the negative - is it really just you being a realist, or is something else going on that is making you feel bad or negative?    Also accept that maybe you will never get rid of that tendency to look at the negative first, but make the conscious effort to look at the positive as well.  For your Build a bear example - it being expensive being your first thought, but then you could think about how you'd be creating memories worth far more than the monetary cost."
DecidingToBeBetter,3d7ufc,BadLuckNovelist,4,Tue Jul 14 05:01:15 2015 UTC,"The money thing really bothers me... I have a good friend who claims to be making a ton of money, but won't spend any of it on anything, ever.  I asked him if he wanted to go to a concert (~$15) of one of my favorite artists, and he went off about how the ""compounded returns"" of $15 over 30 years at the rate of return he's getting on his current investments is >$3k... and he's just not willing to spend $3k on seeing that particular artist.  My counter — similar to your comment about creating memories worth far more than the monetary cost — is that you need to invest in friendships.  That includes both time and money... I go to shows and participate in events that I'm not 100% enthusiastic about because 1) my friends are really into it and 2) I might enjoy myself more than I originally thought.  The most ironic part about this friend is that he's now reached a point where he's complaining about not having any friends, and there aren't interesting people out there to hang out with (for dating or friendship).  I pointed out that I have a group of 6 or so close friends, and that I used to regularly invite him out with this group but he'd always decline.  So, thinking he's changed a bit, I invited him to see ""Inside Out"" (which, as a Minnesotan who lives part-time in San Francisco, seemed really fun to me), and he scoffed at the idea of paying to see an animated movie.  Everyone's financial situation is different, so it may be that OP's budget is tighter than mine or my friend's.  My patience has worn thin for my friend—his repeated refusal to do nearly anything that costs more than $5 has effectively destroyed our friendship.  To echo your point, I'd strongly encourage OP to view these expenses as an investment in a relationship.  Is he really worth less than $25 to you?"
DecidingToBeBetter,3d7ufc,not-a-ginger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:52:16 2015 UTC,"I'm curious - when he goes off how that $15 could be $3k in the future - did you ask him if he was going to invest the $15 he was refusing to use the next day, or what he was going to do with the supposed $3k he would be gaining by now?  I just find it mind boggling that someone could be that deep into investing, making money, etc- but then not bother actually enjoying the fruits of that labor."

Presumably, he'll relax and live life when he gets to that point?  However, currently he lives in his mom's house (rent-free), constantly fights with her over really petty things, and always talks about how he wants to move to the bay area.  I'm a bit older than him (30), and I just see him wasting his 20s being miserable.  Life's a journey... I imagine he will meet his goal, but he'll get to be 30 and realize he has no friends, hates his family, and wasted some of the best years of his life.  When I reached 30, I had a minor panic attack that I was getting ""old"" and the best years were behind me.  However, when I thought about the things I've accomplished, the places I've been, and the people I've met, I realized that I wouldn't have changed anything about my 20s... so, then, it's on to another decade and more adventures.  Also, I hated my parents so hard for so many years, and it was only when I moved out and got my own place did I start to really get along with them again.  I definitely appreciate saving and investing, but I really don't understand doing it at the expense of the only guaranteed thing you have: the present.  There are definitely things I can't (or wouldn't) do today that I could've done when I was 20... and I'm sure there are things today that I'd do which I won't/can't when I'm 40.

I always notice that happier people don't seem terribly grounded, so sometimes I'll make a conscious effort to ""let go"" and have fun with something regardless if it's a good idea. Impromptu vacations, tattoos, or just new experiences in general aren't always ""smart"" ideas, but I think it's really important to do something questionable for the hell of it once in awhile. I went to Thailand last year based on this mentality.   Doesn't mean you have to be wildly responsible all the time, but if you're anything like me you probably need to make a conscious effort to relax that common sense reflex and just have fun sometimes.

I take a second or two to find the positive points and focus on those.   Sometimes I just don't want to do something, but rather than just cancel, I go anyway. Nothing is ever as bad as I think it might be. Except pickles, they are horrid, nasty, disgusting things.   I was recommended a book that I have been reading recently called Antidote. So far it's pretty cool. Rather than vomit roses and poop sunshine, it focuses on embracing the negative view and using it in a constructive way. I'm not far into it, but I like what I have read so far.   I'll never be a rose colored glasses guy, but I refuse to be a cesspool of negative energy. So I work at this positivity thing.  For me, most important is monitoring the acidity of my thoughts. If I'm getting negative, I internally investigate. Why so gloomy? Is it really that bad? I look at what's going on and see that 99% of the time, it's not that bad.  I also like the fake it till ya feel it. I chose to be happy, it doesn't always work, but it works more often than doing nothing. Sometimes, when stuff his the fan, I take a second and tell myself, Canus, you're a beast. It's gonna be a good day. Iyou got this brah. (Adding chubby accents is fun when I do this.)  Lastly, meditation had helped a lot for me. Not the sit and be introspective meditation, although that would work too probably, I do yoga. Exercise and focused activity seen to help my general mood."

Being overly sensitive to criticism really just means that you are way too hard on yourself internally. Some people try to remedy this by swinging the other direction and building themselves up. Don't get me wrong a healthy self esteem is great, I just think the place to start is by developing awareness of what's going on inside of your head. You sound like an observant person from your post with your realization of how this has affected all aspects of your life. So sure, force yourself to think positive thoughts that you won't believe at first, tell yourself ""I love you"" in the mirror. I'm serious, do it. But also work on the developing the capacity to observe your thought patterns, especially the negative ones, and over time develop the ability to just not react, to not go down that rabbit hole of anxiety and self criticism. Is this hard? Hell yeah it's hard! Thought patterns take a long time to change, but I'm pretty sure that I don't need to convince you that it's worth it right? I mean it only shapes your entire perception and experience of life. Disappointed that the top advice is to ""get a referral"", not saying that medication doesn't have its place but I think that should be the last option. Just my 2 cents"
DecidingToBeBetter,3d5bkz,sentayy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:01:33 2015 UTC,"This should be upvoted to the very top.  Great post and 100% correct. I think that most people opt for medication because the act of being aware of your own thoughts and actively, yet gently, correcting damaging thought patterns is difficult to execute over a period of time in order to realize a noticeable difference in your life. But it's ten times better than medication because this act of thought maintenance will change your life if you're persistent and truly committed. I'm speaking from experience. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to be gentle with yourself when you are correcting yourself. In other words,  don't beat yourself up. It's not helping you. Cut yourself some slack."

A lot of my so-called friends won't even hang out with me, to put things in perspective. It sucks but I have only 4 decently good friends outside of work, and none of them are of the opposite sex.  One thing that helps is to realize that most people don't think of you nearly as often as you think of you (if they did, you might know it). They have their own problems and interests to fill their attention. People always pursue their interests first and if you don't see that (even in yourself) you're gonna be hurt.  Also note that if you are interested in your friends' goals and interests, they are more likely to reciprocate.

GPs are actually not just logic boxes, an awful lot of them didn't specialize because they want to provide primary care and you have a primary care issue.   Try that referral. See if it helps - give it time. If it doesn't work, ask for a different referral.   There are multiple causes of anxiety and depression. I've told my story enough - I have a chemical deficiency in my brain, and two grams of magnesium salts every day fix it: and I mean fix it, I can tell when I'm off my meds and so can my friends and cow-orkers.

I found out about magnesium compounds (ascorbate and aspartate) because climbing brought on all kinds of cramps and in alleviating those I found my mood lifting. It was a fluke. Epsom salts are an essential part of a pharmacopoeia but they don't add too much to the level of magnesium in the bloodstream and that's what works for me.

My point is, we're all self-conscious about something, and we're often too self-conscious to spend much time nitpicking other people. You'd be surprised by the insecurities clouding up the heads of those around you!  Stop thinking about others, and start investing time in yourself. Pursue your interests. When you feel good about what you do and the way you live, you start to feel good about who you are. Change the way you live, and it will change you.

But, I do care what people think about me if, for instance, they think I'm a thief or rapist, etc. (which, thankfully, hasn't actually happened).

DecidingToBeBetter,3d5bkz,fire_breathing_bear,4,Mon Jul 13 22:41:11 2015 UTC,"I'm working through this same issue. Right now I'm still at the self-awareness stage, which means that I'm less focused on trying to fix the problem and a lot more focused on trying to recognize what it looks like in my life. (You'd be amazed how many people try to do it the other way round, which doesn't really work).  Right now my main insight is just how much time, emotional energy, and mental bandwidth I'm using letting these people with all their damn opinions hang out inside my head.  I'm not good at trying to stop doing something by telling myself I'm wrong or bad for doing it. I don't like getting yelled at or judged and it demotivates me, even if it's myself doing the judging. I've tried countering the meaner voices with my own kinder evaluations, but that still just devolved into a mess of competing opinions.  Luckily I have a very healthy sense of curiosity about things. I realized one day that I'm honestly not sure what would be in my head if I was just... alone. I don't know what my opinions would be because I'm always either defending them or trying to make them fit some mold of coolness. I don't know what I'd enjoy doing because I always feel like I should either be doing something else or doing what I'm doing better. I don't even know what I'd think about if all those voices weren't in my head.  So now instead of letting my mood fluctuate depending on what people currently think of me (or what I assume they're thinking about me, which is something else entirely), I just try to take some time every so often to remember how curious I am about what I, just by myself, would think about this situation. Somehow that lets me let everyone else go and I just hang out with myself for a while, just kind of... being myself. And I'm kind of getting to like that person. I know that sounds weird and may not be at all helpful, and I wish I could explain it better. I have noticed that the more depressed I get the harder it is to get the critics out of my head (and the meaner the things they say, and the more of them there are, especially completely random people from my past). But I'm much happier when I can make them go away for a while."
DecidingToBeBetter,3d5bkz,UserNameBubonic,5,Tue Jul 14 00:52:31 2015 UTC,"I can relate to a lot of what you said. One thing I've been doing lately is every time I catch myself being concerned with what other people think of me I redirect my focus to what I think of me.  For instance, if I'm worrying that someone would scoff at the idea of me doing some particular thing, I just ask myself ""Well, what do I think? Do I think I could do it?"" The answer is usually much more positive, but the key is to answer it honestly, otherwise it will be empty. Don't just automatically say what you want to hear, really think about it. I've found the answer is usually positive, and when it isn't, that's ok too. At least it's honest and not just automatically negative. And when it's not positive, try to accept yourself even with those negatives, and/or look for ways to improve them when you can.  An analogy I thought of today is that living the way I have would be like if I were in an art gallery with a group of people all staring at a painting. Except instead of looking at the painting, I'm just looking at everyone else's faces and reactions and judging how good the painting is based off of that. So my opinion of the painting has absolutely nothing to do with the painting itself. What I'm trying to do with my new tool is to force myself to look at the actual painting and decide what I think of it myself. And I'll keep catching myself looking at the other people because it's such an old habit, but every time I do I'll force myself to look back at the painting and really focus on what I think about it. To learn to trust my own opinion over theirs. I can listen to theirs, but mine takes precedence. It takes effort and energy and you have to burn a lot of mental calories, but I know after consistently doing this for long enough, it will become a habit just as much as the bad one is now. And then it won't be that much work at all.   I don't know if this is a long-term solution or not. I feel like I might be grasping at straws a little and desperately searching for something concrete that I can hold onto and practice to help myself. But I know that for now it's helping so I'm going to keep doing it."

If a friend expressed these worries to me (about letting other people affect their mood, worrying a lot about other's perceptions, etc.) how would I respond? What advice would I give? Would I think their worries were justified, or blown out of proportion?   It makes it easier to give myself a reality check if I break up my internal monologue and turn it into a dialogue.

Is the eventual result that we are able to be in a meditative state all the time?   Meditation is a conscious effort of telling ourselves that we are in control of our emotions and feelings. We have no control of what will happen or what we will encounter in a day.   What we have control of however is, how are we going to react to it. 10 minutes of meditation or priming in particular helps us focus on what is important and what is positive.   When we know what we need to focus on, most of the time everything falls in to place.   As what Jim Rohn said, ""Every day, stand guard at the door of your mind, and you alone decide what thoughts and beliefs you let into your life.""  I hope that helped. :)"

DecidingToBeBetter,3d4bre,themosphit,3,Mon Jul 13 12:26:27 2015 UTC,"Hey u/themosphit !  I struggle with this too sometimes. The short answer to your question might be, ""You Don't"", BUT, I know I have made some drastic improvements in my own processes I'd love to share. I run cnqr.co mind-body-life academy, and there's tons on there that would probably help too.   A. Remember how you said you weren't jealous of your traveling friends, just your boyfriend? Usually, we get jealous of people we are either consciously or unconsciously competing with, like a friend in the same company or something.   In your case, you're closely going through life with your boyfriend, so it's almost like you are competing on lives. And actually, competition and pushing each other can be really fun and exciting sometimes, in both friendships and relationships! So that's not the issue.   B. You are kind of killing it in school right now. College isn't hard. Medical-focused college is REALLY hard. Hold your head up but keep your mouth closed about it. (confidence)  So that's cool that your boyfriend is traveling around the world, but you are learning about human life, how to save it, dedicating your career to the health and humanity of others. Holy crap. Maybe we're all envious of you.   Never underestimate yourself and your experiences. There is no one else out there like you. Don't ever think of your life as lesser than another person, and don't think of theirs as lesser than yours. You just can't compare lives that way, it's like ranking snowflakes.   C. BUT, you are feeling a valid emotion! Emotions aren't bad, it is what we do with them. Also, emotions are usually symptoms, not the actual problem. A better question to ask is, ""Why am I envious, and what are my options?""   So, my best guess is, you need a little adventure in your life! Sometimes I want to travel the world, but I just need to sit down and re-arrange the apps on my home screen. So start small. Have you ever gone camping?   Set up a tent on the highest hill you can find, look up at the stars, and tell me you don't feel free, small, and in awe. Those are the same starts everyone else sees, including your partner wherever he is.   Just build a little bit more adventure in your life, it doesn't have to cost much. Be a weekend warrior, because school is important to focus on.  Hope this helps, good luck out there."
DecidingToBeBetter,3d4bre,jdarbuckle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice! I'll definitely start living more adventurously, once I move out of my parents house. I'm kept on the shortest of leashes there, hence I'm not allowed to travel anywhere by myself. Also I don't know if this is the right word but I guess jealous(?) since my boyfriend hasn't finished his degree but is rewarded with an amazing job, where I've been in school for my whole life. Don't get me wrong, from what he tells me, he worked hard and did the shitties tasks to get here so he deserves it."
DecidingToBeBetter,3d4bre,jdarbuckle,2,Mon Jul 13 17:39:05 2015 UTC,"You're probably right. Yeah, get out of the house for sure! Freedom and independence is essential, exciting, and needed :)   That makes sense too. You've got to find rewards in your day-to-day life in order to make it through. Take each day as a mini-lifetime.   Wake up early and enjoy the morning for a little bit. Work hard all day, and then reward yourself at night with your favorite things!   Things will never be other than they are :)"

If this construction is voted in then they are selling the house and moving because all around it's really, really shitty for humans to be around. But hooray for big companies making lots of money! So if I drag my feet on saving for a house I look at potentially having to move into another house with my mom, which I want to avoid. Like I said you're right though, just lots to consider.

DecidingToBeBetter,3d0cud,bigmillz,3,Sun Jul 12 20:39:29 2015 UTC,"When I was in a dark place I forgot that I was part of something larger. I felt disconnected from others. Looking back on it I was almost delusional in this respect (I was checked up on a lot by people that cared about me, but I was shut off and believed I was unneeded, and then wondered why they stopped trying and trying, when it was I that gave up on them, not the other way around).  Overall, if you're going to help this amazing person, you need to reconnect with him. This is something that happens only voluntarily, but he's in so much pain he just needs to be put in the right cultivating environment like spending time with you and no doubt he'll like it even if he is antisocial at the moment.  That's all you can do, be there for him when he's forgotten how to be there for himself and others."
DecidingToBeBetter,3d0cud,Wash_Your_Winkie,6,Sun Jul 12 22:10:23 2015 UTC,You could write him a letter detailing all the things you respect as like about him. An outside perspective on how he is perceived by those close to him.
DecidingToBeBetter,3d0cud,r_plantae,8,Sun Jul 12 16:18:46 2015 UTC,"This could definitely be helpful, but as someone who used to have self-worth issues, it can also be a double-edged sword even if it's well intentioned. I always felt guilty for ""tricking people into liking me"" and terrified that someday they'd find out who I really was and I'd disappoint them or they'd leave me, so in a way getting direct compliments with no context can put a lot of pressure on someone with these problems. It's totally irrational but sometimes that's the way it is.  A spin on this idea would be complimenting him when he displays one of those characteristics. It's a lot harder to mentally trick yourself out of accepting a compliment when you're being admired for a direct action because you can't deny that it happened. It also helps because it's in context so it feels more genuine and less like an attempt to cheer you up/pity you. Again, not saying that's what you're doing! But brains are dicks and can twist the most noble, genuine compliments into ""ugh now he feels like he has to cheer me up, what a burden I am"" and this is just a way to get around that."

Similar to cutting in that it relieves his anxiety, and causes scars, but it is not cutting.  I think he needs CBT.  I'm not sure he's quite ready for that step, so I'm trying to be as supportive as I can."
DecidingToBeBetter,3d0cud,BrobearBerbil,9,Sun Jul 12 15:37:47 2015 UTC,"Therapy would be a good starting point, or at least some counselling.  The issue here is that self-esteem and self-worth are things that have to come from the individual. A person with low self-esteem may respond negatively to other people's encouragement or assistance.   The only advice I can recommend is to help him forget about his anxiety by doing something long and drawn out that he enjoys. Helping people. Find something that they enjoy and positively encourage and nurture it.  Helping someone else get better is a hard thing to do, the other person has to want to and has to lead it. Make sure that you compliment, compel and (if you can) reward his attempts to actively do this.  Make recommendation and offer advise but it's he who has to take the lead in this."

He doesn't quite believe me when I tell him all of the positive things about himself, but he says he does appreciate my encouragement.   He is open to change, and he knows it has to come from within.    I spend a lot of time with him on the weekends, as he says that having someone there helps and distracts him from his habit.  We go on a lot of hikes/walks, as he found physical activity helps him to feel better (of course!).    I think he's taking the right steps, but it is a process and trial and error.  It's hard for me when he's so hard on himself, but I just want to help him succeed and see him on the other side of this.  He is absolutely wonderful, and I can't wait till he can see that too.  Thanks for all of your advice!"

The way you described his energy and then benefit from hikes reminded me of Muay Thai classes I took that were very hard at first and took real work to get better at. It was one place where people didn't offer as much false encouragement, like they wouldn't lie about you being good if you still needed more work. However, after landing kicks on a bag after 1000 failed tries, you knew in yourself when it was honestly good and it was a different good feeling in confidence I hadn't felt elsewhere. It was like confidence based in something real I knew myself and not hinged on others opinions. I feel like some kind of steady growth like this would be beneficial.   Additionally, the chemicals released after a hard workout are like a mix of Prozac and Adderall. People feel more positive and more interested in tackling other parts of life."

Tell him to try holding ice next time. It sounds weird, but it will hurt and give a similar rush without causing permanent damage and scarring.  You sound like a really good and supportive friend though, and as someone who's been on the other side of this, thank you. Make sure you take care of yourself too because I know it can be really draining to be someone else's rock.

DecidingToBeBetter,3d17e5,Auriela,2,Sun Jul 12 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"I might consider myself in a similar situation, though with some notable differences.  I graduated from high school, and applied directly for college in my senior year.  I was thinking I would go for math or physics, since that was what I enjoyed in high school.  Then I stumbled on engineering, partly because that was what my dad did and we tend to think alike in many ways.  We did 2 years at a liberal arts college, though I had gone in undeclared engineering (meaning I hadn't specified which field of engineering I wanted).  Usually they give you a year before you declare, because at some point you need to start taking classes to go to your field of study.  The reason I stopped going to college was because I just felt like it was getting to be a waste of time and money since I wasn't having the best time anymore.  However, I'm happy I went for 2 years because it gave me a sense of what a college lifestyle can be like, and it allowed me to try different classes that I hadn't considered taking before.  I took a psych class that I found really fun, but wouldn't have taken unless it was a social science requirement.  If you go to college, perhaps you would find a class here or there that might get you interested in a field you didn't know about.  I also hear many people say they are still figuring out what they want to do after college.  I think if you enjoy learning, you can easily pick something in the sciences that you believe you can do well in, and use that as a placeholder like I did with engineering, and perhaps a passion will emerge over time as you talk with people around you.  I'll give you some other options instead of college that you might look into.  I've been out of college for a year with the intention of going on a gap year.  It's looking like it will be a several year gap now.  I took the fall and did a paid internship at a state park as trail crew.  I'd argue that was one of the top three experiences I've had in my life.  I was planning to hike the Appalachian Trail over this spring and summer, but that turned into a solo cross country road trip that kinda made me broke after 2 months of awesomeness.  So internships can be fun if you find one that's doing something you enjoy.  I love hiking, so the trail work was great for me.  I also learned that between jobs and planned things, it's so important to be busy with something, even if it's volunteering or something.  My winter sucked ass, and that's why I'm subscribed to this subreddit in the first place.  I just sat around and played video games.  Not a proud time for me.  Right now, I don't really see any major in college that I really feel passionate about.  Engineering was like a placeholder for me.  I was good enough at it to get good grades, but I wasn't passionate about it.  What I am passionate about is more of the outdoor adventure lifestyle, but I prefer to do that on my own as opposed to finding an Outdoor Pursuits major somewhere.  So it's kinda tricky for me too.  I'm planning to just be working for awhile now to pay off a car, and go backpacking and hiking in my time off, and let time do its thing.  With college, you don't need to necessarily go get a degree.  I didn't.  Maybe it makes getting a job easier if you do have a degree.  I've thought of going to classes to get an associates degree over a few semesters.  But you can always try it and leave if it doesn't work out.  I don't think they would penalize you for leaving.  I just took an exit interview thing and it was done.  I hope at least a bit of this you find helpful.  I'm still figuring it out, but I thought I'd share what I learned from being at college and having a somewhat ""empty"" experience there."

DecidingToBeBetter,3d17e5,ntype511,2,Sun Jul 12 20:04:33 2015 UTC,"If you know you want a college degree, I would just wing it. When I first went to college I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do. I couldn't even narrow it down to what I liked or anything. But somehow I figure it out. It took me awhile, but considering how long I was undecided I had very little credits that were ""wasted"". I also worked full time through school and graduated with just one grand of debt. I do NOT recommend doing that by the way. But if you're really concerned with the money, doing something like that is doable, even today.  You also mentioned that you thought every major has its drawbacks (internships, job market). These things work themselves out in the long run and if you use them as an argument to not do something, you will never go anywhere. Every choice you make will have hard things you'll have to do or drawbacks. That's why you do things in little by little. So when picking a major don't compare them by the hard stuff you'll eventually have to do because that's too big of a variable to make decisions on.   Btw, I have a bachelor of science in biochemistry and only had to take statistics and calculus for math. So if you're worried about math classes as a science major it might not be as bad as you think."
DecidingToBeBetter,3d17e5,ghostlyinthesky,2,Mon Jul 13 07:59:53 2015 UTC,"I think the first place to really loo is what do you really enjoy in the science field? Sure, with just about everything there are caveats that will make it unappealing but there are other paths to pursue. Maybe you could take up academia, even. I'm leaning more towards picking a major and winging it.  I've been in the same boat as you and am still trying to figure that one out. Went to college for two years for arts then dropped out. Didn't feel right. Have had a better education since pursuing self-teaching and such. A lot less debt too.   And math terrifies the heck out of me too."

If you're trying to practice there's duo lingo or you can go old school route and find a native speaker.  I've always put that I'm bilingual and I've never been asked for any kind of certification.    Just want to add my two cents to this comment.   I got my certification at the college I went to. They also offered a minor but I stopped at the certification. I never took Spanish in high school so I had to take four classes of actually learning the language, and after that, my certification was just two extra classes. So if you can pass out of the intro classes, it might not be that expensive even if you did take it through a college.   Or if you're already a pretty good speaker, I would just write that you're bilingual and be done with it. In the US, Spanish speakers are so sought out for most of the time they don't care about your credentials.  If you're trying to brush up your skills and not necessarily interested in taking classes, try the app HelloTalk. It's designed to connect language learners with native speakers via instant messaging and phone calls. So you basically teach each other your native language.  There's also the subbredit r/learnspanish. So you could ask your question over there too."

DecidingToBeBetter,3cyi2e,ebradlee10,2,Sun Jul 12 07:09:24 2015 UTC,"I'll try my best.  The book is divided into 4 subjects.  *Discipline *Love *Growth and Religion *Grace  Every section uses the information from the last section to bolster it's own meaning.  Discipline started off with ""noble truths of life"", such that it is enormously difficult, and suffering cannot be escaped.  It talked about the roots of many mental problems, and how some people have transcended them.  Love, as Peck sees it, is an extension of oneself through suffering and effort.  Love is the opposite of laziness.  Love is not lust  He talks about forms of ""false"" love such as dependency.  Love, to peck, is the greatest force of the universe.  Growth and religion is something that everyone strives for, even the agnostic (because that is a religion according to Peck).  He used case studies of psychotherapy patients who needed to abandon the God as they knew Him in  order to heal.  He also had the case studies of patients who became more religious and spiritual in order to heal.  One of his defining points was that one should neither blindly follow religion nor blindly deduce that there is no greater/universal force.  He defined successful spiritual growth in which ones denies religion but then grows to be more spiritual in their own way.  Grace - the most riveting section.  I would say he defined grace as any force of good that falls outside of natural laws.  It is everywhere.  It comes from our subconscious and nature, and the subconscious of others (the power and importance of the subconscious is a HUGE theme throughout the book).  The most memorable part in grace was the notion of entropy as ""the original sin / chief malevolent force of the universe"".  Things such as evolution, spiritual growth, and love, actively work against entropy and grow despite natural laws that would dictate otherwise.  Essentially, anything that is not entropy is ultimately the force of some benevolent God (referring to God not necessarily in a christian sense but a supreme universal force of good).   Sorry if that was long-winded.  I summarized it as best as I could."

DecidingToBeBetter,3d1etc,ToastedOak,3,Sun Jul 12 19:06:20 2015 UTC,"Life's unfair. Wallowing in that fact will not make it better. You are not entitled to female attention, sex, lesser-looking friends. The universe has absolutely zero interest in you personally; the only one putting you down is you.   I get that it's frustrating when people tell you not to worry about something they have no experience with. But they are right that you should try not to. Worrying does not help. Being obsessed with women does not help. On the contrary: chances are that your desparation carries over in your behavior. You want a girl so bad that you don't care about who she is at all; she's a girl and that makes her an object of your desire. Speaking for myself: I don't like to be thought of or treated as an object. I can imagine it puts other women off as well.  You say you are boring to be around. Why? Is your life boring to you, or do you assume others find it boring and therefore you have to change? If you are unhappy with wat you do and who you are, than find ways to change. I agree with /u/Snofflewaffle: start with making decisions based on who you are and the person you want to be, not based on the off chance someone will spread her legs for you.  Sex is good. Intimacy is better. And the only way to build a intimate, equal, healthy relationship is if you can truly see the other person as a person in their own right. And I think that if you loath yourself, you are in no position to do that. You are way too busy hating yourself to allow genuine interest in another person. Ironically, your obsession with women is too self-absorbed to allow you to make a connection with someone else.  This is going to sound trite, but: find validation within yourself. You are not worth more or less any other person. If you are convinced that you are, than that should be the first thing to work on. You are probably perpetuating a cycle of negative thoughts about yourself and the world around you, that is reinforcing your belief that you are a loser.   For example: FACT: you have attractive friends. NEGATIVE THOUGHT I: they are more attractive/interesting than you. NEGATIVE THOUGHT II: you are not attractive/interesting/worthy of anything in life. CONSEQUENCE I: you feel, think and act like someone who does not succeed in anything, and resents that. CONSEQUENCE II: people meet a guy who has nothing interesting or positive to say about his life or himself, and avoid him. See how that deminishes your chance to any meaningful interaction with others?  Your self-image will not change over night, it takes a lot of work and honest self scrutinizing. In the meantime, try to focus on others. Ask questions, really listen to others. Stand for what you believe in, and don't be afraid to laugh at yourself. Fake being that confident, interesting and interested guy until you make it.  If you've read all this, you've had a load of criticism from an internet-stranger to deal with. I don't mean any of this as a personal attack (but understand if it feels like one for you). What I wanted to convey is that you are in charge of your life, even if you cannot control others. Use the focus you have to pt yourself down to help yourself up. Stop accepting self-pity, but be kind to yourself. You have limitations, just like everyone else. You can navigate life within their boundaries, just like everyone else."
DecidingToBeBetter,3d1etc,Snofflewaffle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:02:47 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I know how you feel. I've spent years with pretty much the same thought patterns as you just described, and all I can say is that your friends are probably right. I'm sure that's just about the last thing you wanted to hear, but if your entire existence is devoted to getting a partner, how exactly are you going to do that? People are attracted to other people because of how interesting they are, what they do, what they enjoy. If all your time and effort is put in to this one thing, then there might not be anything else about you that attracts someone.  I can't really offer up much advice and I'm by no means an expert in these issues, but personally, just giving less of a fuck has helped me tremendously. Instead of saying ""I'm gonna do this and it's gonna get me a girl"", I say ""I'm gonna do this because I want to"". It might seem counterproductive but if you do things because you want to, it makes you happy. If you're happy, other people can tell and it rubs off on them. From your post you don't sound like a terribly happy person, and I just want to finish this by letting you know there are people you can talk to. I'm around a fair bit if you ever fancy a chat, but f you seriously have thoughts about harming yourself, then that's something you need to discuss with a professional or a trusted loved one."

Then you'll get laid, and you'll have someone in your life as well."

It's absolutely true that most of us are either haunted by the events of the past or too busy chasing after the things of the future. During this process most of us forget to live our lives moment to moment, really missing out on living our lives to the fullest.   The whole ethos of mindfulness is to encourage people to live their life moment to moment, like you said anticipating everything that is actively happening in your life, and really embracing it.   It can be as simple as practicing every day mindfulness such as eating. How many of us eat on a couch while watching TV? While we should be practicing mindful eating.   The littlest things and decisions we make on a daily basis shapes our entire life and destiny. I've written an article recently about the 7 life transforming things you could do every day to live a much more fuller life day to day.

I think you're very articulate and thoughtful. You're obviously very smart and perhaps that is what's making you over think a lot of things in life. Comparing you with others that seem to not have any of those questions and making you feel like you lack purpose, without a sense of belonging. Remember that life is a voyage, and this quest is not something that's supposed to be over at 25.  I'm 37M, and still have those questions while my friends dont seem to have them. Some suggestions for you (some are repeats from others but they're good advice):   Talk to someone. Have a trusted confident works wonders. Someone that listens, not that tries to give you advice constantly. Just by being listened to you will feel a better sense of belonging, things won't be as heavy. Older folks may also help as they've most likely also felt the same way. Talking to my father once I was amazed at how spiritual he was, I wouldn't have known if I haven't approached him once when I thought it would be pointless. If you have no one, a professional councilor is an option.  Be true to yourself and take the time needed to know who you are. What makes you happy, what doesn't. I find the most difficult thing is knowing your limits. And accepting them. I wished I was a certain kind of person but I'm getting to see that I'm not. I'm happier when I'm being myself instead of what I think k I should be. Some books that helped me: the road less traveled, by Scott Peck the miracle of mindfulness, by Thich Nhat Han (a buddhist monk) Seek inspiration. That may mean stories of people you admire, going out with friends doing what you like(whether chatting, playing a game, registering in am event like a race). I find I need to do this constantly, getting inspired is not a one time thing but something that keeps the fire (or at least the little spark inside) on. Check the Santiago Camino  Link   I walked it when I was 24 and helped a lot at that time. You can start wherever on the path, stop at refuges which are like youth hostels, and it does wonders to clear your mind. You can most likely find a guide book that will tell you where to go, where to stay. It helped me get to basic. The only thing is once it was over, I hadn't all my equations answered but I felt more confident to find them.  I wish you good luck. And dont be too hard on yourself.

I do wish the whole ""do what you love"" mission statement would go away.  I teach college and I see so many students stressed out because they don't have a career all planned out.   Some people are really lucky - they always wanted to be a firefighter or doctor or teacher or, for me, a reporter.  I got to ride that ride for a long time and I loved it and I was good at it.  But you know what?  I got laid off - along with thousands of others - and I had to figure out another path.  I like teaching and I will do anything for my students, but it's not the same.   All you can do is take one step at a time and build your life. Join a gym. Get a library card.  If you love running, join a running group and make some friends. Have a sit down dinner with your parents once a week and let them talk about their day.   Do not build your life around a man. I have so, so many friends who gave up all their dreams and followed a boy.  Most of the time, it didn't work out, and they lost their career, their friends, their life.

Also, just know that this isn't the kind of thing that goes away overnight, but it will get better until it's all resolved. Also, you don't have to make any huge decisions today. Don't put that pressure on yourself. Is there anyone you can talk to? A friend? A close family member? Someone you trust that isn't your boyfriend? If not, consider talking to a professional - not even as a thing you'll do on a consistent basis if that's not what you want to do. Just as someone who will listen objectively, in person, and maybe have some objective advice. Often it just helps to say things out loud to someone. It somehow helps you process things better, even if they never end up saying a word back to you. Hope you start to feel better soon, but know that it's okay to be panicked about big life changes.

That last bit is basically the distilled essence of Jesus's message.  Just by the way, there aren't really any biological issues for interracial kids.

Throw some headphones on listen closely to the guided meditation and separate yourself from all the junk. Meditating isn't a clearing of the mind really, it's more acknowledgement.

A dear friend of mine loaned this book to me years ago. Not until I had my first seizure driving home from work one night did I pick that book up. After many tests, neurologists later told me these seizures were likely due to stress.   Stress can kill you. I'm 25 years old and it could have killed me.

Because of your obviously high intelligence, try listening to Alan Watts lectures- many are available on Youtube. If you want to make a radical change, and the idea sounds appealing, try a 10 day silent Vipassana meditation retreat, available all over the world. It's a chance to disconnect from your perceived reality of your lifetime assumptions, empty your mind and see what happens when you stop attaching so much importance to every little detail in life.   One caveat: you can't smoke weed the 2 weeks before the retreat, not during the retreat either.   if interested, check out [dhamma.org](dhamma.org)"

DecidingToBeBetter,3cx9fj,hopeless_n_confused,2,Sat Jul 11 20:07:53 2015 UTC,"Legit question. The reason is that the retreat challenges one to understand the voices in their head telling them things like ""I can't focus without using a substance"". The theory is that ultimately we all have the ability to regulate our emotions without other people/substances, but it take 10 days in absolute silence to even start hearing the voices that tell us we can't.  I went through, and many people go through a really really difficult experience- facing thoughts that were suppressed for years, flashing back to previous memories, etc.   Ultimately I gained a hell of a lot more inner peace after the retreat. I almost gave up in middle and said that I can't control myself, I'm a slave to my depressive thoughts forever and I""m actually worthless (note: my own personal experience does not say what other people will feel). When I realized I had 4 days left in solitude and nothing else to do, I continued meditating and understood that I really am not controlled by these voices in my head. This new understanding will continue to improve my quality of life for the rest of the time that I walk on this planet."

There is a lot of stuff you can do, take shorter showers (and buy a showerhead that uses less water), turn the heat/airco down and wear more clothes/use shades wisely, buy fresh vegetables instead of frozen, limit your meat intake (meat costs a lot of land/food to produce, less meat is more room for other foods and nature) too more complex stuff of using rain water for your toilet, better isolating your house.   Maybe you can donate clothes/shoes you no longer wear? I never throw away clothes, because someone might be able to make something useful from my shoes full of holes.

Living a solitary lifestyle isn't the way to advance yourself, neither is being a party animal.  It's more about getting a balance in life, about give and take.  Having a plan where you study a few nights a week, chill a night or two and spend time with friends would probably give the best sense of satisfaction.  If you're afraid of failure, don't be.  No-one (and I mean no-one) was ever a massive success first time and the absolute worst thing in the world that you can have is regrets at not trying.

Balance tends to be the answer to a lot of questions when it comes to lifestyle.

I just stay at home mostly learning how to program, reading a book, and figuring out a business I can create online. I feel that making time for these things everyday is how I can accomplish them. I'm afraid.    In order to achieve the goals you've set for yourself you will need to sacrifice some things. However, as /u/Automannix and /u/L1nchp1N said, it's about finding a balance.  Sure, if you want to have a successful business or pursue a career in programming you'll have to spend a lot of time learning but that doesn't mean you have to ignore friends and family, and equally important, you need to blow some steam off somehow so there will still be plenty of opportunities to black out.   As for being afraid, that is understandable, I mean that's a big change you want to make and change is always scary. You know what is also scary? Regret. Waking up, realizing you are 60 and thinking what could have been. What if I went against my fears and did things different. Man I wish I was 25 again...

If you're usually having cravings after working out, why not carry protein bars for example, they're delicious and healthy and you can always use some proteins after training. And for after dinner maybe buy yourself some dark chocolate and indulge a bit, in moderation of course. Dark chocolate is good for you and would normally fulfill your cravings if you have a sweet-tooth."
DecidingToBeBetter,3cszet,Omnicole,7,Fri Jul 10 15:38:51 2015 UTC,"If you're similar to me, you work best when the temptation can't even present itself. If I'm trying to eat healthier, but there's still a bag of chips in the house, it's really hard for me to resist that one bag of chips when the urge to snack comes up.  I'm an abstainer: I have the most success when I don't even have the option to break my self-made promises, at least until I've grown accustomed to them!  For this reason, if you're on your way back from the gym, is there any way you can leave your money at home? If you don't give yourself the option to cheat, so that you truly can't, it may be that you won't after that. Once you get used to not eating junk food as often, you can gradually carry more money with you, step by step, and treat it as a real challenge: ""Today will be the first day I carry my credit card with me after the gym, and I will prove to myself that I won't cave to a junk food craving. Tomorrow, I will resist the temptation by not carrying my card with me again. The day after, I'll see.""  As others have commented, carrying healthy snacks with you will go a long way. Ask yourself if you're really hungry or just craving something: if you truly are hungry, even some sunflower seeds will be delicious. If you look at those sunflower seeds (or whatever else) and think ""meh,"" you know it's a craving, not a hunger.  From there, I think you can move more into cooking homemade meals or anything else - as you discover your own healthy, delicious recipes, it may help combat the urge to buy a bag of chips or something!  Hope this helps."

In your case, make it a goal not to stop by the store after the gym for at least two weeks (hopefully this will get you out of the habit).  fourth: Read labels...there are so many proclaimed healthy bars that might as well be a snickers..always go for low sugar, low sodium, and minimum ingredients.   Remember junk food is an addiction, and like most addictions there is the potential for set backs...So mentally prepare for the long haul and you will win this battle (I was addicted to sugar, tons of set backs, but finally I don't have cravings anymore)"

I'm sixteen, so I live with my parents. I think I would be intruding if I asked them to stop buying junk food because of course I'm not the only one in the house. Do you have any tips for avoiding junk food when there's always a supply readily available at home, any time I want it?"
DecidingToBeBetter,3cszet,WAKEUPANDSMELLTHEPOT,4,Fri Jul 10 18:06:10 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing when I was in high school. I ate hotdogs straight out of the pack, candy, chips, soda, individual slices of american cheese, pretty much anything that was in the house.  I decided cut back when I joined a sports team, and discovered I was running out of breath faster than the kids who smoked cigarettes. Cutting back helped IMMENSELY. I felt better after a just a couple of weeks.  Just try asking your parents to help. Say ""hey, I'm trying this no junkfood thing, and I'm having a hard time with it because it's all around the house. Could I ask you guys to stop buying junk food for a month, just a month, and see how it goes?""  Put a time limit on it, and ask for their help. If they aren't willing to do that small thing, then I'm afraid your parents are jerks!  The time limit thing helps for yourself as well. It's much easier to convince your id to give something up for 1 month than it is to convince it to give something up FOR THE REST OF TIME. Track the number of days you are successful. If you break down and cheat, it's not a big deal, just get back on the streak again, and try to beat your high score.  Also, heads up, your body will crave the junk food for a while. Technically speaking, junk food is packed with easily processed energy that your body fucking loves. Unfortunately, it's also packed with an equal amount of preservatives, and other shit that your body hates. Treat it like an addiction, because it absolutely is. Quitting junk food feels like quitting coffee, or cigarettes, or gambling, or porn. It overloads your senses with an amount of salt and sugar that your weak human body was not designed to handle.  Try replacing junk food snacks with more healthy snacks. Carrots, apples, and frozen vegetables are good. Quick to make is very important. The problem with healthy food is that it's not full of preservatives or salt, and doesn't stay fresh for very long. It's not convenient.  Another trick that might work is brushing your teeth. If you feel a craving coming on, quickly go brush your teeth. The toothpaste ruins your taste buds for a while, and gives you a little extra time to bring your willpower back up to full capacity. Plus you'll have healthier teeth. Bonus.  Finally, if this is something you're interested in, one of the best things you can do is to simply start thinking of yourself as a person who doesn't eat junk food. ""That's not a thing I do"" It's not an overnight thing, but as time goes on, it becomes more and more a part of you, and who you are. Give it a shot. Good luck!"

It's much easier to convince your id to give something up for 1 month than it is to convince it to give something up FOR THE REST OF TIME.

I find it helps me continue if I want to do it for say, 15 minutes. It's a good idea to apply to junk food ""five more days, five more days"" can turn into months without it and success. Thank you, that's an amazing idea.   Just try asking your parents to help. Say ""hey, I'm trying this no junkfood thing, and I'm having a hard time with it because it's all around the house. Could I ask you guys to stop buying junk food for a month, just a month, and see how it goes?""

If I could do it all over again I would have added lunges or squats to the rotation. It built a good foundation until I was able to drive and join a gym. Working out personally, makes me a happier more laid back person.   Well since the junk food is always around it will be tough. So try one day this week to go with no junk food. Then next week make your goal two days...and add a day each week. After 6 weeks you will only be having junk food once a week...and that would be a significant improvement...On the days you do each snacks remember moderation...skipping a day or two at first will make you really want to eat more snacks the other days.

DecidingToBeBetter,3cszet,WAKEUPANDSMELLTHEPOT,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:18:23 2015 UTC,"Well everyone has a different starting point but the goal is to keep getting better, but safely. Remember to keep as good of form as possible to prevent injury. Below are videos for proper form  push-up form https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF0jbubK_jU  plank form https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSHjTRCQxIw  crunch form https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKmrqcoCZ-M  lunges form https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab1exCz-qOg  squats form https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1v152b72lo  Ok now to sets and reps: the first week of working out will really be just finding out where your starting point is.   first do as many push-ups as possible with the proper form. Take a 2-3 min break and do 15-20 crunches. Take another 2-3 min break and do again for 3 total sets.   Now you know your starting point..lets say you did 70 push-ups...on your next upper body day set your goal to 75 push ups. So 25 for each of the first two sets...then the third set push for 25+. Eventually your three sets will start to be in the hundreds and you will be pushing to just get one extra push up. Do the same strategy for each work out...for planking it is about time instead of reps..so start off trying to do 35-45 seconds each rep. Remember form is the most important thing...if you get to tried to do a workout with good form take a break..it is better to miss a goal and try again in a couple days than to get injured reaching a goal and not able to workout for a few days or longer.   Day two do lower body a 3 sets each of squats and lunges, with about 2-4 min break between each workout. I know I sound like a dad now but remember proper form is the most important thing.   Day three upper body push-ups and a core workout   Day four legs.   If you do more than 4 days...have those workouts be something you enjoy, or really want to focus on or go to youtube and find a new workout to try.   after a few weeks to a month once you feel comfortable with this workout...think about adding one more workout each day..maybe a triceps workout to upper body and a new leg workout.   Now I am by far not an expert and I am sure there are plenty of people at /r/fitness that have tons of advice as well.   One thing that has always worked for me is the workouts I do are tough, but I don't hate them or dread going to the gym. If there is a workout that you just hate or dread try a different workout. It is better to do a good workout for years and years than to do a great workout that you end up hating and quit doing after a few months.

What I've been doing recently in my lunches is packing my normal lunch, except halving the amount of chips I normally bring and bringing a huge amount of fruit instead. I tell myself I have to eat all of the fruit first, and then if I'm still craving the chips, I can eat them. Usually, I'm full after I eat the fruit and I don't want the chips.

NEVER shop Hungry - If you aren't hungry when you shop, you will be less likely to buy those ""junk"" foods or sway away from your diet plans 2. I would recommend having a ""deeper"" reason than doing it to be healthy. If you have kids, or a close family member, it would be easier to say you will eat healthy for them. This is what I do... Eric Thomas calls it ""Your Why"". 3. Find ways to still enjoy the ""junk"" foods you like by substituting them with ""healthy"" alternatives. For example eating Pasta made from black beans or edamame instead of wheat noodles, or having a sweet potato instead of a baked potato 4. Treat yourself once in a while (after you DESERVE IT), meaning have a cheat meal ONCE a week of whatever you want... Just don't over do it on portion size.... --- Remember: What you think becomes what you say, and what you say becomes what you do. You can build these habits by DOING it over and over.... Good luck and I hope the best for your goal!"

I know many here don't like it, but keto has helped me to cook healthy because the diet doesn't let you eat anything in restaurants, especially not fast food, because you cut out carbs completely.  That way, I had to always cook my own meals and now I wouldn't want it any other way. Keto also kills hunger, I sometimes have to force myself to eat and I've lost 55 lbs in 6 months.  If you don't want/can't do carb restriction: eat something before you go to the store. Eating right is 1000x easier if you don't have junk food at home. You need the least willpower when your decision not to have junk food happens in the store and not at home."

It may be strange to admit this, but you're a recovering addict. And no one is sympathetic to someone recovering from a sugar addiction.   How many times have you heard ""oh come on, just have a piece of birthday cake! You don't want to ruin his birthday do you?"" or ""is one little muffin really going to kill you?""   Now replace the birthday cake and muffin with a shot of whisky, and say that to an alcoholic trying to clean up his life.   Fucked, isn't it?   Overcoming a junk food addiction is difficult because it's EVERYWHERE! You'll find sugar in the strangest places, even in spots where you wouldn't expect it.   And of course, that's not even considering the high carb, low nutrient addictive junk foods like chips as well, which may have a lower sugar content but are just as addictive.   Now look, the idea is to not be too hard on yourself. Your willpower is like a muscle, and needs to be built up.   Just like you'll have a hell of a time running 5k on your first day at the gym, you'll have a hell of a time cutting out junk food cold turkey immediately.   So go easy on yourself. Make yourself a solemn vow that you won't eat any junk food for one day. Then, fucking follow through with it. As your reward, you may cheat the next day. But the day after, make the same oath you did the previous day.   Then, once you've done this for a week or two, move it up to two days. Then three days. Eventually you'll be going a week or more without sugar.   Go easy on yourself man. Set ambitious but realistic goals for yourself, and celebrate each milestone.

The answer to your question depends on whether or not you identify with the sensation of anxiety in the moment; do you internalize it as part of who you are, or do you observe it as a passing sensation which has come for a visit?  Anxiety is an ego mechanism. It appears to be a defect, yet it is extremely effective at serving a very specific purpose. It reinforces the feeling that 'you' exist, somehow independently of the dream that is your life.  'You' have no existence beyond thought. The thought and thinker are exactly the same. Neither is substantial. What is left is the body, which is seamlessly integrated with the rest of the physical world. Boundaries are concepts only.  There is a reason that really bad trips often precede spiritual realization: the terror is the ego's last-ditch effort to maintain the illusion that it exists. When it lets go of the energy wasted in this effort (manifested in the body as the physical feeling of tension), the result is bliss."

DecidingToBeBetter,3csez6,BadNewsBrown,9,Fri Jul 10 18:14:56 2015 UTC,"Shyness becomes anxiety when it's holding you back, basically.  Near everyone does have the potential to be outgoing social butterflies, but there's no need for them to do so. If being the life of the party doesn't appeal to you, and you'd rather relax at home, that's just fine. However, when it's anxiety keeping you from going, that's another beast.  A lot of treatment involves doing social butterfly things, because it can often help to confront your fears, and help soothe it when you see that things go just fine. I'm not a therapist, but as I understand it you're not expected to become an extrovert, they're just trying to make you comfortable with being social in general, so that you're actually chosing to be quiet instead of being forced to it by your brain."
DecidingToBeBetter,3csez6,PROUD_HUFFLEPUFF,3,Fri Jul 10 12:13:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think that being a social butterfly is  a triumph over anxiety (for me). Many social butterflies come off as too phony or dramatic for me, but I'm an introvert. I found out in undergrad that I can be more easily social if I walk into a setting where there are people with similar values and hobbies.  I'll give you the example of my brother (Extrovert) and me (introvert), we both have general anxiety disorder but we can still see our different personalities show through.  An introvert means that you re-energize by being alone, you think first and talk second, and you prefer to have a certain degree of intimacy when socializing. My brother, a super salesman and an extrovert needs to re-energize by being in large groups and leading the group (he often seeks to be the alpha) because that is how he gets validation. He forms his feelings and thoughts by talking them out first (this gets him in major trouble)  and meaningful gestures to him have to be made in public for him to feel that it is genuine (lots of oversharing here). His anxiety makes him act impulsively and repetitively. He would freak out if he had to spend one on one time with a person for too long, that would require too much intimacy from him.  I present my anxiety more like a duck on water - I look like I'm calm and gliding on the surface, but there is a lot of furious swimming and foot action hidden below. I need to process my anxious feelings internally and I receive my validation internally- or from a small circle of friends that I have very intimate relationships with. When feeling anxious, instead of acting impulsively, I experience a paralysis. At work, I find more meaning working behind the scenes than being the most visible person, so I am a mid-level manager and brother is a sales person.  To me, my anxiety progress isn't based on whether I experience comfort being the center of the party. My goals with therapy have been about breaking self-sabotage practices, creating more resiliency and self-efficacy, and experiencing longer bouts of mental peace. My brother's goals have been to stop being as controlling or impulsive, stop jumping to the worst and most dramatic conclusion, and stop beating himself up over and over again when he messes up."
DecidingToBeBetter,3csez6,Browngirl1983,2,Fri Jul 10 21:20:41 2015 UTC,"My anxiety seems to come out more when I'm alone at home. For some reason thoughts begin to flood my mind. Depression and just bad vibes tend to overcome me and I end up doing nothing all day and feeling bad about myself.  But when I'm out socializing, there are people constantly talking to me or things I need to do that my mind has no time to go dark. I love being at parties and social gatherings. It's odd because no one can really tell that I have anxiety problems based on my outside personality. That's why I always try and find something to do with people. Anything to stay out of my house."
DecidingToBeBetter,3csez6,Im_A_Racehorse,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:10:17 2015 UTC,"I've been the opposite, actually. Because of my anxiety I have been the outgoing social butterfly in order to combat the fear I constantly feel. If I'm in a situation that makes me feel anxious, my immediate reaction is to try to get cues from my environment by talking, interacting, and making it my own as much as possible, rather than to close up inside myself. It helps me shut down the anxiety instead of giving into it.  BUT - it's also exhausting and I find that I'm not really an outgoing social butterfly unless I'm trying to overcome a difficulty. I'd much rather be quiet and comfortable. My extroversion is really my defense mechanism."
DecidingToBeBetter,3csez6,teamPEDs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"For me, reading up on introversion and extroversion helped a lot. (It's all about where your recharge comes from. I'm an introvert; I recharge best in a quiet room with a book, not anything that glows. My buddy's an extrovert who recharges best surrounded by a boisterous party. We get on just fine, but we have different needs when we're running on fumes.) That doesn't mean I'm a spontaneous fun social butterfly - I'm actually a cranky engineer with a nerdy sense of humor - but it does mean that I respect HOW I need to operate, and having a full fuel tank gives me more latitude for WHAT I do.   It took a lot of practice, but I'm starting to identify anxiety's patterns - which means I can start to draw that line. I am not, innately, fearful of everything. That's anxiety sticking its oar in.   A good therapist helped me to figure it out, along with some online CBT resources - anything that helps you figure out where a given thought came from, and how you decide to act on it or not, should be helpful here."

This was very hard for him, he didn't  know anyone, couldn't hear people, because of the noise, and was feeling bad. This is the normal response, he gets extreme pain in his stomach at the thought of talking to another person.  I am an extrovert and started talking to him, he ignored me. I nudged his arm to get his attention.  Long story short, we are now married. But, it was and still is very painful for him to be social. Social anxiety doesn't just go away, it can be told to quiet down and you can put on a mask to do stuff.  As for meeting people in general, come out of your comfort zone and talk more than you are used to. My husband has found coping strategies, like focusing the topic on a hobby vs personal feelings.  He also still needs plenty of time to himself. I am telling you all of this, because I sympathize with you cause I see it causes so much pain. He tells me stories of previous attempts of dating, he went on a date with another introvert, and the date went very quietly and awkwardly. Jess might also be an introvert and have different forms of anxiety. But more realistically, she is not into you.  It sounds as though you are more upset over the panic attack then Jess was.  As for ending things with Jess, how about backing up a little and let her give you attention. If none is received, there's your answer."
DecidingToBeBetter,3crr3y,RunPastTrouble,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:31:53 2015 UTC,"Hi there, thanks for sharing your story with me.    Social anxiety doesn't just go away, it can be told to quiet down and you can put on a mask to do stuff.   I've learned to mask it ok in front of people especially at work which is a more controlled social setting, but put me in a bar, at a club, at a party (any less controlled setting) and I quickly become very withdrawn, shy and awkward and that's if I go with people. :s I won't even go to a place where I don't know anyone ... although I want to challenge myself to go out alone more often and see what happens. Even if I don't meet anyone being there is a huge step. So your husband was really brave to go. I'm pretty familiar with the stomach pain, it can make me feel really sick at times.   As for meeting people in general, come out of your comfort zone and talk more than you are used to.    Thanks for the tip, I know I tend to over-think my words and actions. I'm scared of looking dumb, sounding ignorant/uneducated, etc. And so I become a very reserved, edited version of myself. I need convince myself that most people aren't judging everything I do/say negatively but it's hard to rationalize with anxiety.   Jess seems pretty outgoing/friendly but has her awkward moments. She's talked about being depressed after a bad breakup earlier this year and she isn't over it 100%.    But more realistically, she is not into you.   Why did she ask me out? And compliment me often for a time, she'd also visit very regularly and stuff. These things stopped/lessened after I turned her down. Does that mean she was never really into me? I don't get it. I'm sure she at least finds me attractive. She's said in the past that I was 'beautiful.' I dunno. Based on her behaviour now she doesn't seem interested but it seemed like she was before... Again, I've always been crappy at flirting/dating/ and understanding people's interest in me. I tend to think no one likes me or ever will, and that every one is just being nice. UGH. I'm pretty hopeless. lol"

DecidingToBeBetter,3crr3y,geeeese,2,Mon Jul 20 04:27:07 2015 UTC,"Hello Loveless64, let me first say I accept you. I accept your brain feels the need to impose limitations on you by making your fight or flight responses go off the deep end in situations that everyone else appears to handle so normally.  I actually had my 3rd panic attack at work in front of people, different people than the last two times so I'm not looking forward to Monday myself to be honest. Any ambition or drive I had towards work related goals seems defeated at this moment. So I understand why you are questioning ending the friendship with this person. It always seems like our brains lean towards the solution of rather than solve the problem...just get rid of it.  But you didn't post this to hear someone agree with you that we're basically damaged goods and indirectly put up huge warning signs telling people to stay away...or did you? xD Well fortunately for you, there is always more than one side to any story.  For starters don't try to prevent anxiety, instead you need to accept you have it. Seriously on that note... kudos to you for opening up to her and letting her know you have it, even if she doesn't understand it. You opening yourself up not only admitting to them but also yourself in front of others is actually a big deal. We make ourselves vulnerable that way, but that is a good thing. See we tend to isolate ourselves, build walls in our heads and till our mind becomes a cell and anxiety is our jailer.   But honesty about our flaws is the shovel that will dig us out of this prison we built around ourselves. At least we are making ourselves look bad by admitting it on our terms, way better than having an attack in front of everyone and letting everyone know we have panic attacks on anxiety's terms.   So to make clear on the points you want addressed...  You don't want her to feel sorry and act extra nice  Simple, think as they think but be honest at the same time. For example, panic disorder sucks we freak out over a world that in our head if we think about it logically doesn't make sense as to why we are so afraid but despite that fact we are freaking the hell out regardless if we are ready to or not. But you know what, if someone says ""awww"" or ""that's so sad"" I make a joke that is actually holds some truth ""Don't be, my ancestors just had stronger survival instincts than others...if they didn't I might not even be here today"". What they don't know is that I wish I wasn't even alive or born, but they don't need to know that cause that is my emotions talking.  You have no idea how to prevent future attacks around her  Admit it for a moment, does the thought of trying to think of ways prevent future attacks only increase your anxiety. It's the unknown variable the reality of how little we can control our situation similar to how we lack control when we have a panic attack. So the very thought you proposed is a catch 22, cause thinking of a solution only feeds into the problem being worse.  In which I can honestly say to you, if she can't accept you for you and you are being honest and true to who you are. She isn't worth making a big deal over, wish her happiness, hope she finds the right person because you need someone who understands or is at least willing to understand you so you can be happy too.  Attraction leads to stress  Oh this one hits so close to home with me, it's like you want something you feel will make you happy. But your body freaks out at that off chance it can happen, and it doesn't make any sense cause it is as if your body is punishing you because you believed for a moment you could be loved.   But it seems you are choosing to deal with that issue by not acting on your attraction and instead settling on perhaps some relaxed friendship just so you can reduce those stress levels around her. Well I can understand that, I feel like if my body won't let me have more than I will take what ever I can get because if friendship feels good then take it. I wish I had a better answer to give, but I think of seeking friendship with her is like swimming in the pool for the first time....but you are building up your ability to swim before you decide to venture out in the deep end of the pool. (aka attempting to be more than friends)  Should you end the friendship  No, and to help you keep the friendship going make sure you do a mental check on yourself. Don't let yourself get carried away with expectation of this or that occurring, if things happen organically and you respond to it poorly then so be it...when I learned to swim for example I almost drowned. But eventually I got back into the pool and learned...dealing with anxiety no matter how traumatizing can be overcome with time and practice.  If my comment doesn't help you, I do hope someone else is able to resonate some wisdom so you can stand a bit taller on those two feet of yours. But if you want to talk more or share stories, feel free to PM me. Like I said being honest about yourself and your flaws is a great way to deal with your disorder so if you don't have anyone in real life or online to speak to, I'm more than willing to help you explore this idea and see how it works for you."

Because of these facts I don't use it much, and plan to only use it during stressful events ex. a party, social gathering, etc. Its recommended dose is 4grams/week at most and no more than twice per week.  Ironically on the day I had a panic attack in front of my crush, I contemplated taking Phenibut before leaving the house but decided against it. :s Regret it so much now and wonder how our encounter could have gone if I had actually used it.

I'd be interested in doing some research and trying it out.   ive tried marijuana but the moments when I feel weakest are the moment they can reoccur while high   I don't understand, are you saying you would continue to have panic attacks while high? Or that the marijuana made them worse? I've always heard weed was supposed to have calming effects. :s  I have depression at times too, how did you make your brew? I'm seriously open to trying this.

Your anxiety and lack of self-esteem. You need to fix yourself before you attempt to have friends or relationships. You can't love someone if you don't learn to love yourself. And it usually is the case, in my experience, that the way you treat others is the same way you treat yourself. Anxiety is complicating and may require treatment but a general form of advice is to sit down one day and think of all the negative thoughts that come into your head and work on fixing them. Try to get some exercise in if you don't already. It works wonders on your self esteem. Compliment yourself from time to time and try actively find positive things about yourself. I'm not familiar with social anxiety but I would attempt to approach small social situations and make small steps in getting yourself out there. I have a feeling that your lack of self esteem is causing you to over react and panic. Maybe you take any criticism too harshly? But like I said, work on yourself first and foremost. Everything else seems to be just adding stress. Once you are comfortable and happy and can take a breath of fresh air without negative thoughts in your head then seek friendship and more.   Good luck."

Your body is designed to adapt and survive so it will absolutely gain muscle if you train and eat.  There is a TON of information over at /r/fitness which is the best information in the world all approved by a huge community and assembled in an easy to understand format. Go over to /r/fitness and read the wiki.  It should answer almost everything you want to know.... and then tomorrow there is the ""Foolish Friday"" thread where all the strange, stupid and curious questions you have on anything from training, nutrition, how to do an exercise, what to wear, what vitamins and supplements you could try are encouraged and answered.   I personally suffer from PTSD and anxiety. I can definitely say exercising and lifting helps. Outside the gym I have found HUGE success with ""EFT Tapping"" so I would encourage you to Google that of you haven't heard of or tried it yet. I also think meditation is extremely important and enjoy using sounds like this when meditating or trying to relax.

DecidingToBeBetter,3cqc4s,swim76,3,Fri Jul 10 01:35:57 2015 UTC,"Muscle builds quite quickly and if you are eating well and working out regularly your strength and endurance  will recover in about one to two months, you need to be careful  to condition joints though. I would aim to Do 6 weeks building to high repetitions at a very low weight so the cartilage in your joints can condition to your new  physical level then look at strength  training once you have a base fitness level. For me building up this way worked best and I avoided setting myself back with injuries or being to sore to train regularly. Training regularly  is more important than gaining strength imo as regular training will also help you mentally.   Incorporate lots of walking and if possible swimming (excelent for asthmatics) which are low impact on joints but increase endurance/overall fitness. Avoid injuries at all costs, you will start feeling better as your body gets endorphins from excercise that it hasn't had for years with depression. Don't go too hard and burn out, aim for regular long term routine."

DecidingToBeBetter,3cqc4s,wishIknewwho,4,Fri Jul 10 01:50:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't aim to get tired from excercise atleast initially, after  such a long period  of inactivity your routine should be more like a rehabilitation program than a fitness routine. Imo your goals should be (in this order): (1)routine - doing a small amount of regular easy excercise for 3 months is better for you than pushing yourself to your limits for a few weeks and then stopping because of burnout, over exertion or injury. (2) build Endurance. Incremental improvements over the longer term are  more likely to become permanent part of your lifestyle. If you want to do more make sure it's low impact, walking, cycling, swimming etc. Important: You should not be too sore to work out the next day, weights should be about 50% of what you estimate you are capable of. atleast for the first few months. Still increase weights as you get stronger but try and stay well below your max capability  After a couple of months you can move from rehab to a strength and fitness routine, you will have more discipline from working out regularly, with less chance of injury as your joints and muscles will be better condition  than they are now after such a long period of inactivity."
DecidingToBeBetter,3cqc4s,MsKim,3,Fri Jul 10 02:19:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, good job! I don't know you, but I'm proud of you!  I've suffered from depression for a large portion of my life and I've come to know exercise as a kind of medicine. There were times in my life where I would do pushups in my apartment while crying my eyes out, just to try to squeeze out some endorphins to make me feel better. And you know what? It works! Its a short term fix, you really do feel less depressed for a few hours after and, as I'm sure you know, any kind of relief is welcome.   As someone who has had a consistent exercise habit for years, the best advice I can give you is to recognize that doing something is better than doing nothing, no matter how small. There are some days when I will take my vitamins, change into my gym clothes, go to the gym, stay there for 8 minutes, say screw the whole thing and go home. ...but that's okay! If you just make yourself go through the motions of working out it still becomes a habit to do it, and eventually getting exercise becomes your default.  Also, find something that you actually like or at least don't mind doing. I really don't like running; I'm not very good at it and it's very uncomfortable and boring to me, but some people love it. I do, on the other hand, like hitting a heavy bag and lifting weights so when I do those things I don't walk away loathing exercise and I keep coming back.  If anything tires you out at this point then it's all good; do anything you like that involves moving around. When you first start exercising is when you see the most dramatic results. I'd recommend pushups, body weight squats, and some kind of light cardio like an easy pace on a stationary bike or just simply walking. ...and of course stretching.  You can do this!"
DecidingToBeBetter,3cqc4s,alliezoomzoom,2,Fri Jul 10 03:36:48 2015 UTC,Do some stretching/basic yoga and walk daily. You will start to feel stronger quickly and then you can slowly add other physical activities.

Sure, you can jump right into workouts again, but you're likely to injure yourself easily.  The fastest way to undo all your hard work is to overdo it and end up standing still again. I'd suggest several days of yoga/low-impact cardio before attempting a baby lifting session. See how you feel after that, and then increase. Make sure you set some realistic, achievable goals too--small gains that will add up to larger ones.  You've got this :)"

One theory is that it's because the sheath around the muscle fibers has already been stretched out. I think another is that you still have more muscle satellite cells.   You might look into HIT. High Intensity Training, not to be confused with HIIT which is High Intensity Interval Training. HIT workouts are short but very effective. So if you are low on motivation, but can at least get in a short workout you will get good results."

DecidingToBeBetter,3cqfqz,CircaSurvivor55,7,Fri Jul 10 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"Dude. I know the feeling. I turned 25 in December, and at that point I was about 20 months into a job I loved. Globally, I was one of the youngest people doing what I was doing. The company I worked for was horrible, and the people in positions of power hadn't the slightest clue what they were doing.  Second week of January I got the fuck out of dodge. The environment was so toxic that literally, the first 5 minutes I was in my apartment, my girlfriend noticed how incredibly relieved I was.   Anyway, I spend the next few weeks working my ass off, applying to jobs, touching up my resume, playing the game. I was so excited because I felt so liberated and motivated.  Fast forward to the middle of June. Things had gotten really tough for me. I had applied to a countless number of jobs, interviewed at a lot of jobs I would have loved, and repeatedly missed out on awesome opportunities... sometimes because of my qualifications or I just wasn't myself interviewing, whatever. I had gotten a lot of really great feedback regardless.  But great feedback doesn't pay the bills, and by the last week of June I was in a terrible place mentally. I felt like such a piece of shit and I had spun into this terrible depression, and just 24/7 felt powerless and out of control.  June 23rd I got a call from a recruiter who found my resume on indeed and was working for a company about 8 minutes from my place. I interviewed the 24th and it it off with the CFO and the Purchasing Manager for the company. Later that day, the recruited called me and asked if I could go in the following day for a second interview. Went back, met with both of them again, and the president and vice president came in to meet with me. I struck up a random conversation with the president about something I had actually read that morning on reddit and we talked for over 20 minutes. 5 minutes later they extended me an amazing offer with a salary increase of 40% from my previous job doing something I love doing, and my first day was June 29th. I had never felt so welcomed before in my life, and after my 8th day today, it feels like I've been there for years.  Sorry for the long read... I just wanted you to know that I missed out on so many awesome fucking opportunities. I beat myself up over it, I let it take over my self-esteem, and I genuinely lost all hope. But 6 months of hell brought me to an amazing job with amazing people. Great pay, great benefits, and best of all.... a respect that I had never been given from other people. You're going to feel how I feel right now soon enough. It'll probably get tough at some points... and self pity is inevitable.   Don't feel bad about feeling bad. Just take something away from every bad experience. Every bad interview I had, I changed up something, or tried something new. Just remember when you get that gutted feeling again, we've all been there. Sure some people got lucky and didn't have to go through what I went through, and Im happy for those people. But just know you'll get 'there' soon. Until then, just work hard and enjoy what you can now.  Best of luck. Feel free to PM me if you need to vent or just want some advice from someone who just went through the same thing!  PS: one piece of advice I really didn't listen to enough during the last few months.... be yourself when you interview. Seriously."

I struggled a lot before then, bouncing between several different career beginnings and education along the way.  Then I got my foot in the door at the very bottom rung of a great company, and just used all the struggles as incentive to climb. Now things are significantly better than where they would have been had I followed the path I wanted to do when I left school.  Goals are great, don't ever give up on them. But being adaptive is honestly one of the best skills you can develop. Keep going forward, but look sideways along the way too. Your 20's are an opportunity to explore without burden."

I got off Facebook and switched Instagram to professional only. My online interactions are 100% purposeful now, and having a purpose has allowed me to control the way I approach each user I connect with in a positive and uplifting way.

DecidingToBeBetter,3cnid7,mr_loose_cannon,2,Thu Jul 9 16:52:52 2015 UTC,"A little thing that helped me:  Whenever I find something to dislike about someone (which is quite often, unfortunately!) I try to see it as an insecurity or sadness instead, which it usually is. It's easy to do because more often than not, it is the truth. Every time you find yourself disliking someone, remember what they show you is more who they want to be than who they actually are. Everyone is insecure, everyone has the ability to be fragile and everyone puts on a front to protect themselves, even you. If it helps, imagine all the things you hold back from saying and doing in conversations with friends and strangers alike - this is not you completely, not always - now allow others to be the same. :) I honestly believe empathy is your best bet here, it has worked wonders for aspects of my cynicism.  Another little thing that might work is to try and find the genius in everyone. It's not quite exactly what it sounds like but everyone is good at something, and everyone will be better than you at something. If you could make it part of your mission to find out what that great thing is, it will distract you from looking for the bad.  Even someone as ""dumb"" as a little kid could give you an insight you're unable to see because of where/who you are in life, for example. Intelligence is merely one thing that makes us great.   It would also inadvertently make people like you more for being more interested and less judgmental (not that you have said you need that, more of an added bonus).  I used to be a huge misanthropist, and I suppose I still am in a lot of ways, but what makes us great as a human race is BECAUSE we are different, not in spite of it.  To compare yourself to others - in a positive or negative light - is unnecessary and burdensome. The only record you need to keep breaking in life is your own.

DecidingToBeBetter,3cnid7,gingerlaur,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"First of all, I would like to say that you shouldn't feel excessively bad about thinking that thought. I know it's not the most compassionate or beautiful thing to wish onto someone, but after all, it's just a thought. And you can't control your thoughts. Every attempt to do so might make you go crazy, so I would advise you to accept what happened, accept that you have bad sides (as well as good ones!), and that you aren't always the nicest person (but sometimes you are). It's a natural thing for human beings to sometimes have destructive tendencies or be aggressive towards others for our own selfish reasons. That's okay! What matters is how you deal with those things. Do you deal with your resent in a healthy way, for example by working extra hard to be better than that person? Or do you deal with it in a manner that  is hurtful for others, for example by writing this person a card that says ""I hope you die""? You said yourself that when interacting with this person, they would never know the resentful thoughts you have, which means that YOU WOULD NEVER HARM THEM. You are conscious of the way your behaviour affects others. This is a very good thing! Hold on to that.  In conclusion, you can't be THAT much of an asshole, because you didn't actually hurt a fly. Of course you are A LITTLE BIT of an asshole, but so is literally everyone else. It is normal for people to have some asshole-ish tendencies and some nice tendencies, and life gets a lot easier when you can accept that about yourself.   If this resent really bothers you and you want to change it, you could try to figure out what exactly your negative feelings are targeted towards. What is the reason you feel so resentful?  For example, I get very annoyed when people who honestly have gone through something terrible use this to ""garner"" sympathy. In these instances, those people truly deserve any attention and special treatment they can get (for example because they are sick or experienced a trauma). This doesn't stop me from being annoyed, I'm a cold hearted bitch that way. But figuring out the ""scheme"" of situations I get that way helped me realize that I myself might want the attention those people get, and that's why I discredit them.   In your example, you seem to be upset that someone got a lot of praise for his seemingly mediocre work. You might feel that your work is better and that you put a lot of effort into it but aren't getting the level of praise you think you deserve. Could this be the case?  If so, it seems best to re-directed the attention onto yourself, because it's the only thing you can actually change. Why aren't you getting as much praise as this other person? Is it because you are hesitant to put yourself out there? Do you need to put yourself on the market more? Or is your work lacking in any department?   This is merely speculating and I don't actually know you, but maybe you yourself can thing about it and it might help you figure out what's going on."

Every time I judge people out of hand or try to boost myself by putting others down I remind myself ""If you are only being nice outside your brain, you aren't being nice."" It helps me step back and mentally compliment or appreciate the person instead.  Also judgey and terrible thoughts have a way of cropping up once in a while  no matter what, as long as you reject them, those thoughts don't define you."
DecidingToBeBetter,3cnid7,megnn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:02:58 2015 UTC,"I commend you for being honest with us. But to answer your question of how to stop this behavior, only you have that answer. Now it's your turn to be honest with yourself.  Simply ask yourself, ""why am I like this?""  I'm suggesting that you need to do a little brain/life surgery, which requires the brutally sharp blade of honesty and self-assessment. Trust me, self-honesty is probably the best place to start.   Further questions:   What part of my life or experience shaped me to think this way? Is there something I fear or some pain that causes this behavior? Am I seeking some release or reward when I have these thoughts and behavior? Do I very clearly know how to identify and recognize these negative thoughts or behavior when they come up? Do I genuinely want to stop these thoughts and behaviors? How can I address the causes and turn my thoughts and actions into something positive? Can I commit to thinking certain thoughts or acting a certain behavior when these same guttural fears, pains, causes, stimuli happen?   I challenge you to ask these questions and more. You may learn more about yourself in the process.  Aside: But to actually answer your question, from a stranger's perspective, I know that this world is competitive by nature. It's all too easy to be sad and jealous when recognition and resources are hard to come by. Lack of resources and recognition can create a sense of fear caused by lack of security or lack of ""success"" (which is defined and embedded differently for everyone). This fear can degrade one's self-esteem. Most people judge each other by their actions and appearance, so we place pressure on ourselves to outperform others and achieve recognizable and tangible success. As a result, human value is derived from actions, outward appearance, performance, and artificial metrics, rather than looking at a person as intrinsically having value for being a living being. In other words, we tend to value the actions, assets, and appearance attached to something living, rather than life itself. But life itself is a miracle and, as you've seen, a fragile one at that. In people's pursuit of materials and fame, we often fail to recognize our own mortality and the sanctity of life. It's then easy to become as empty and cold as the material wealth and fleeting recognition we seek.   TL;DR Death comes swiftly for all, and instead of embracing each other and life itself with gratitude, we are busy collecting more wealth (which almost all goes to the taxman eventually) and recognition (as if Facebook likes and popularity are measures of a person's value).  Sorry for the heavy-handed moralizing, but I see this as a possible explanation for a lot of people in the same boat."

DecidingToBeBetter,3cnucx,NEVERDOUBTED,2,Thu Jul 9 19:49:25 2015 UTC,"General tips:   Follow your gut feeling. If you feel good about a decision, it's most likely the right one. If you feel bad about a decision, it's probably one to be avoided. Never risk what you aren't willing to lose. Wait until the last possible moment to make a decision. That way you're not making decisions in a hurry. Some situations are ""it's not IF it'll happen, but WHEN"". Murphy's law. For example, autonomous cars. Avoid slippery slopes. Seriously, you'll end up in the hospital for that. Just kidding, but avoid slippery arguments - in many situations you can't predict the future (Murphy's law still applies). For example, if you want to ask a girl out at the gym, but then your brain starts going ""well, what if it doesn't work out, then I'll have to dump her, then I can't go to this place anymore, because it'll be awkward to see her, and everyone will know, etc."" You can't predict shit like that, and even if it doesn't work out, how do you know it'll not end on good terms? Between money and experience, always choose experience. Experience pays for itself in the future. For example, I'd rather work at SpaceX for 70K a year than at some small local firm that's willing to pay 100K. This, my father taught me. It's easy to move from a big name, well-known company that's doing cutting-edge stuff to a medium to small company if one day you want to. It's almost impossible to move up to big name companies if you started at small-medium companies (only exception is if you're exceptional, like superstar, 1 in a thousand type). Never close doors if you don't have to. Never burn bridges. Basically, if you have the power to decide, don't forgo that power and let someone else decide for you. I know people who said they never wanted to go to medical school, so they didn't work for the grades at first, then when they changed their minds, that door already closed for them. On the other hand, I knew someone who didn't want to go to medical school at first, but still kept excellent grades, and then when his parents lost their jobs, and job security became important to him, he was able to apply and get in."
DecidingToBeBetter,3cnucx,bmn15,2,Fri Jul 10 02:14:52 2015 UTC,"I went through a phase in my life where I felt like I couldn't make a good decision for the life of me. I honestly thought I would get better results by using a Magic 8 Ball. So I did. Some cool things happened. Some not so cool things happened. What I learned was the difference between random choices and the decisions that I didn't want to leave up to chance. It freed up a lot of time I spent in over analysis and regret and it made me much more mindful of the things that made me want to take my time to sort out. The 'say yes to everything' is an alternative to this kind of self exploration, I feel. That's my intuitive advice.  Edward de Bono has written some interesting stuff about 'learning how to think'. I have his '5 day course on thinking' book and it's super old but pretty neat. I don't think any of his tools have proven to be scientifically valid but what it did for me was help me think about HOW I was thinking and it helps. Coursera and Stanford online also have logic courses you can take. I used 'The Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments' with my son and it's fun for kids and adults, I thought but any good philosophy book will explain logical reasoning. A favourite at my house is The Philosophy Book (big ideas simply explained). There are tons of books available free online, Lewis Caroll has an interesting one. That's my practical advice."

DecidingToBeBetter,3cl03m,rgdenis,4,Wed Jul 8 23:51:01 2015 UTC,"Journaling on a regular basis helps immensely. Heck, sitting down and writing out your thoughts and feelings even once can make a huge difference. Of course, more is better, but starting anywhere is a good step.  Also think about what it is that's giving you anxiety and make a practical list of it (or just a mental list). This is not exactly like journaling because it's more of a list, but you'll probably find that it helps to pinpoint real problems rather than thinking you actually fear the whole world.  Cut back on expectations - even for the above tasks. It's not an overnight process usually, but forgive yourself if you only write a sentence or two and then nothing for months. This isn't a test or something, you're just doing it for you, so why make yourself sick over it? As for the list of stressors, don't feel the need to tackle every one of them or any of them just because you have them on paper. Yeah, it might make you feel better to eventually take care of them individually, but the point is to help you distinguish the true fears that underlie what seems to be a general feeling of doom or panic."

I regularly use a journal at the moment, and it is helpful in creating an ""anchor"" in the midst of waves of thought, allowing me to cut through the bias of my limited momentary perspective and become mindful of patterns. To anyone else experiencing similar problems, give it a shot.   That said, the act of journaling can cause a great deal of stress. I often feel like everything I put forth has to be ""right"" or accurate. I am skeptical of my assertions, so afraid to commit to any way of thinking. But yeah, I have been making myself do it anyway of late. It can be seen as an exercise in acceptance of imperfection."

That's why I think the part about lowering (or removing) your expectations is probably the most important. I wouldn't even call it imperfection, honestly. Imperfection is a judgement call on what is or isn't perfect. Anyway, I think I'll quit before this starts to sound like a bunch of cheesy one-liners that will ""save your life,"" but congrats on the journaling and looking toward acceptance.  Edit: Have you tried free-writing, by the way? It's helped me when I start gravitating toward essay mode and away from the actual purpose, which is to get feelings out. Basically, just start writing and keep writing for at least... well, I suppose you make the decision before you start. It might not always lead to something, but it one or two issues usually rise to the top."

Write down your insecurities, your difficulty to commit to your assertions. Get comfortable with saying ""I'm not completely sure this is how it happened"".  The point of the journal is not to be a 100% accurate record of everything that happened. It's supposed to be a way of getting things out of your head and onto paper, to force you to put all of it into words and to think about it more explicitly. It seems like you already understand that on an intellectual level, but you need to understand that on an emotional level as well.   So don't be afraid to write in a ridiculous, stream-of-consciousness type way. Hell, maybe you could explicitly try to do that: try writing the most logorrhoeic garbage you've ever written for a week or so. It might help you to get more comfortable with imperfection."

I have zero self-confidence.  How can I be self-centered?  Egotists have, like, big egos, right?  Then I was told that self-centered people don't necessarily think too much of themselves, it's just that they think of themselves too much.  So I stopped thinking of myself as much, and started to try to think about other people.  I tried to put myself into situations where I was doing things for the benefit of other people, under the guidance of other people, and tried to stop myself from obsessing over the results, because, after all, it was neither being done exclusively by me or for me.    As long as someone else was in charge and someone else got the benefits of my actions, I could get my ego out of the way and let go of my perfectionism.  I tried to get involved in club and group projects, and do a bit of volunteer work.    Little by little, it started working, and my self-centeredness started to unwind a bit.

Playing an open world game like Fallout is both pleasure and pain.  I am constantly in turmoil when I have to decide how to complete a mission, and if it doesn't turn out to my satisfaction then I feel the urge to start over.  However, as I've gotten older (early 30's rn), I've sort of learned to go with the flow in video games... mainly because I have a HUGE backlog of games begging to be played, and I just don't have the time to complete games like I use to so I'm at peace there.  I am less at peace with my creative side.  I know I am capable of great things and just like you, every once in a while I have created or co-created something that in hindsight I am proud of.  But more often than not I struggle to start or finish anything because I have these impossibly high standards.  I am very self aware and I know exactly what it takes to succeed but I guess the fear of failure and not exceeding my expectations keeps me from being the person I want to be.  The struggle is real!

I would also have problems playing video games and I still have problems when I'm looking at learning anything because I end up looking around on the Internet looking for the perfect guide out there which I never find. This leads me to bookmarking a ton of resources that I'll probably never look at and me wasting time trying to figure out how to do something rather then doing it.  I have yet to find the silver bullet but as with any anxiety disorder, learning to clear your mind can be a big help. You can look into Buddhism or just plain meditation with all the philosophical parts removed or you can also try yoga. I'm currently studying Buddhism on and off because it resonates with me. If you have a really hard time clearing your mind then try yoga. I think it's a good choice because you also have the movement of your body to focus on. If your to anxious to do it in class then you can do it on your own, there's tons of resources online including videos on YouTube. If you have little or no experience with yoga then you should consider trying a class, all yoga schools I've come across offer a free class to try it out. If you go to a class try to remember to focus on breathing and the postures,  if you are doing anything wrong the teacher will help you but the postures are straightforward so you'd be fine for the most part. I would like to add that I really enjoyed yoga and I always left class feeling very calm and clear headed."

Perfectionism is a pain in the ass that I'm familiar with. You have high expectations that can't be met and you procrastinate which increases the anxiety. It turns into an endless loop of frustration. There is a sliding scale of perfectionism but the best way to measure it is how it affects your quality of life. I'm not saying it's the case with you but there is a lot of overlap between ocd and perfectionism. I have both and it greatly affects my life. There is a therapist I've been seeing for 10 years that's an expert in both and it's helped me immensely. I used to get depressed about all the lost time and how everyone was further along than me. Once you learn to accept certain things and not to compare yourself to others then a burden is lifted. You are still very young and have alot of time to explore life's adventures and learn new skills. I'm 34 with one year of college left and have persisted through a lot of bullshit. Here's what I do in regards to my perfectionism.  -set a reasonable goal  -figure out what is needed to get there  -break it down into manageable chunks  -keep failing until goal is reached  -enjoy a blunt, have a drink, masturbate, or whatever makes u happy  I have learned more through failure than everything going perfectly.

Sometimes I'll have an ""on"" night where I pull witty or interesting conversation out of my ass but the next I'll be socially retarded again.    It feels like I don't belong, or maybe I was born in the wrong time.  I just can't seem to connect with anyone.  Most of my interests only last so long until I feel I just can't make any progress then it just burns out.  I have a house full of unused hobbies that I no longer have the drive to pursue.  The only thing that keeps me going is the hope that things might eventually get better...I just wish I knew what I could do to speed it up.    Fuck...now I'm rambling.  It's just relieving to know that I'm not the only one.  Seriously, I could've written your post...I have the same outlook on shit."
DecidingToBeBetter,3cm7j3,drizel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:44:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, I can definitely relate to all of this (including being relieved that I'm not the only one). I definitely have my ""on"" moments where I manage to somehow be witty or have the right piece of obscure knowledge at the right time and manage to get some people to (seemingly) like me. It kind of sucks if I see those people again because I get the feeling that they think I'm cold and aloof if I don't manage a repeat performance.  I definitely keep going for the same reason. I don't know if things will eventually get better but life has surprised me before so who knows."

Instead of bashing yourself, why not see the chair as a symbol of your accomplishments? You've worked hard! That chair shows it! Even if you suddenly dislike the fabric or shape or whatever, it shows that you went out there and worked hard and did something with what you earned from that work!  You learned from that piece of furniture. You've learned from those houseplants. You've learned that it's hard to be human. Everyone struggles with that. And you've gone as far as to verbalize it. Many people don't do that and struggle without that self-awareness. You are in a position to understand them so much better now. Everybody loves a person who they feel like ""really gets them""  (translation: someone who listens and doesn't get all super judgy).  Have you heard the phrase ""take ownership of yourself?"" Dude. OWN yourself. You are who you are. You have your tastes. You have your own life experiences. No one else has that in the same combination as you do. You bring something of worth with you everywhere you go. Even if it's just a listening ear. ESPECIALLY a listening ear, taking in what another person says without interruption or violent judgment. People love that.  As for talking about yourself, you're taking language classes? That's pretty darn interesting. I want to hear more about that, so I bet there's other people who would be interested in that.  Plus, the next time you go out somewhere and have the opportunity to strike up conversation, ask that person to help you solve a problem. You mentioned you had trouble finding an ""attractive"" hobby. Why not use that? Say, ""You seem like a pretty cool person. I've had trouble finding a fun hobby that's interesting. Do you have any suggestions?"" They'll either tell you what they do or something their friend did, and that can open up to a very interesting conversation.  I hope this helps. Look, I felt like I rambled, just like you felt about your own post. Will you please tell me if it actually sounded like that? I would appreciate it! A simple yes or no. Ta-da! You've done something for another person, and it was pretty easy. And I appreciate the gesture a lot. The next time I run into you, I'd say to myself, hey that person is a great one. He (she?) helped me out once, which was super nice. That's the same way it works in real life!  Anyway, someone out there (me) believes in you. Good luck."
DecidingToBeBetter,3cmflk,DaveyBaby27,3,Thu Jul 9 01:20:14 2015 UTC,"Yes! I'm so happy I get to share this story/anecdote/advice/experience on this website. I've been saving it up for ages and waiting for it to have some use to at least one other person.     So when I was young, I didn't know how to connect to the Internet, and in those days, we needed to use dial-up from a desktop anyway. My sister had this really, really old laptop (well, really old if you look at it from today, it was probably just like somewhat old at the time) and it had a couple of apps/programs on it, including Pinball and this mermaid game, as well as TypingMaster. Because I didn't have Internet and was bored, I'd either play the Pinball game, the mermaid game, or TypingMaster. I didn't play all that much, but it was enough to get me going and get a pretty good score on this bubble-popping thing.     Fast-forward to 8th grade. I went to a private international school so I was really lucky to have Computer Class in middle school. We learned basic functions on Excel and Word and the like, and we spent a few weeks on TypingMaster. The teachers gave out awards at the end of each quarter, and the computer teacher (who taught the entire 8th grade) said that whoever got the highest WPM on the paragraph-typing test on TypingMaster would get the award for that quarter. I'd say this was about two one-hour classes a week on TypingMaster, but to be fair, I think I was already pretty good at typing by then anyway. But it helped immensely.     In any case, I typed at 126 wpm and the good thing with typing is that you pretty much maintain it. Obviously now I settle into probably like 100 wpm or something, but if I took that test again, I feel like I'd be able to get 115+ on the first or second try. The program/app or whatever is great because it teaches you correct hand placement, which, at this point, I've been doing for ten years, and which really helps maximize your typing speed. I'm sort of elitist about it now; I cringe a little bit when people don't type properly, haha. Anyway, I hope this helps at least a little bit. From what I see, the basic version is free, and I think that should at least get you started :)     tl;dr: TypingMaster + a bit of practice."

DecidingToBeBetter,3cjkxv,RollerDerbyWhore,35,Wed Jul 8 12:26:24 2015 UTC,"hi OP.  as someone who has lived through (scary large number of) different eras, it looks to me like every generation starts out bearing both incredible unfairness and incredible advantage.  i know young people right now really believe they are the doomed generation.  my heart aches for all of you.  i wish i could give internet hugs, kindness, attention and encouragement to every one of you.  i admire you for your seamless integration of technology into your life, into your consciousness.  i admire your refusal to go along with the truly terrible system in place.  a system that might kill all of us, cook us in our own poisons. i admire you in more ways i can list right here.  as a grandparent-equivalent, i see two things happening.  i see that young people have both incredible unfairness and incredible advantage.  the unfair aspects of the traditional job market seem very real, i don't think thats imagined or exaggerated.  but you have to take into account the incredible power you enjoy at your fingertips as well.  with your digital fluency, and your unprecedented ability to connect with the world at large, you are capable to create and use paradigm-breaking new technologies, services, ideas.  there are (flawed, but existing)incubators like Y-combinator that nurture new ideas and help them realize their potential.  watching Kickstarter change society is astonishing to anyone over 30.  if you look at the world only through the lens of The Old-School System, things look grim for everyone except the 1%.  Thankfully a new system is arising, one in which the playing field is a lot more level.  I mean, even just looking at reddit, the CEO who is in her 40s doesn't know how to use reddit!    grandparent-aged me couldn't get hired at my age anywhere for anything, despite having demonstrable skills and an excellent track record spanning many years.  the world has next to no use for me any more.  so now I'm on my own, making up a cottage-industry for myself.  wish me luck.  i dislike Facebook and Twitter and Instagram but thats a big part of how i have to market myself, so i better learn quick, eh.  and its all changing so fast.  the pace of change steadily increases  when i was a little kid, due to the cuban missile crisis, people started taking their savings out of the bank to dig Bomb Shelters in their backyard, lining them with thick concrete and filling them with canned goods to attempt survival of nuclear war.  neighbors were doing this.  once a week supersonic warplanes flew over the city.  i can still vividly remember dreading the sonic booms.  at school we had to practice ""duck and cover"" drills to help us survive the predicted bombs.  they sent us home with notes for our parents saying ""wear loose white clothing in case of nuclear attack"".  as kindergartners we all knew what a ""fallout shelter"" was.  thank god you guys haven't got that horrible yellow+black emblem burned into your mind.  in summary, i'm glad you guys aren't growing up feeling literally physically personally doomed in the short term.  you guys are doomed in the mid- to long-term by climate change  i was 7 when they shot the president on national television.  his brains flew out into his wife's lap.  on tv.  all the adults were crying, in a way that was scarier than anything else.  next, in the space of like 18 months the president's brother and Martin Luther King were both publicly assassinated.  i'd been taught to view police as guardian protectors, yet on national television they firehosed and sicced police dogs onto black protestors during the Alabama riots.  the brutality and unfairness were bone obvious.  quite the eye-opener    for us oldsters, god help you if you differed from the extremely narrow norms of the time.  god help you if you were gay, or non-white, or female.  beating your wife wasn't against the law until 1920, and wasn't enforced until about 1970.  sexual abuse of children didn't become illegal until 1973 and wasn't strongly enforced, it was considered a private family matter.  if you got pregnant outside of marriage, it was a horrible social crime, the worst imaginable, you were exiled.  abortion was not only illegal but incredibly primitive and dangerous.  contraception was all but nonexistent.  sex was dangerous and shameful and in a sense you basically risked your life if you were sexually active.  you have no idea how much freedom and safety young people have in comparison to oldsters at the same age.  i see how times are tough for you guys.  i know we oldsters don't fully understand.  but equally, you have no idea what we lived through.  changes that we were able to make in the system have become the water you swim in -- transparent, invisible, your god-given rights.  hey when i was in high school they were still forcing people to go into the army, they were dying like flies in Vietnam.  guys i went to high school with got killed over there.  they called it The Draft, the lottery-like mechanism that determined your forced participation in the military.  it was based on your birth date.  as soon as you turned 18 you got a ""draft number"" and you had to report too the military or you went to jail as a Deserter.  people ran away to Canada and became fugitives for life to escape Vietnam.  our parents thought the world was falling apart because guys had long hair, people smoked pot, listened to rock 'n' roll (gasp), socialized with black people, questioned authority.    some women rebelled against the imperative to just have babies and become housewives. this was regarded seriously as The End Of Civilization.  when i grew up women didn't have careers!  we were barely considered teachable!  we weren't considered to have the intelligence, strength, or ability to contribute!  girls went to college to ""get their Mrs. Degree"" as opposed to prep for a career! (i'm describing 95% of america at the time -- there were exceptions).  i escaped my family and struck out on my own during senior year in high school and although i had a (crap) job and a (crap) paycheck i couldn't get a bank account unless a male, any male, ""cosigned"" everything.  a woman couldn't buy a house unless it was together with a male.  even though it was supposed to be legal, the financial system wouldn't award a woman a mortgage til the '80s.  and, and, i have not enough appreciation for what my parents went through!  the great depression of the 1930s, women with no right to vote until the 20s, alcohol prohibition, WWI, WWII, escaping europe for the seeming opportunities of the USA, suffering intensely as new immigrants who didn't speak the language and endured terrible discrimination, unimaginable abuses and unthinkable traps,  hopelessness beyond description.  anyone telling you you are ""doomed"" is only looking at one side of things.  its true you have a terrible burden to carry and you have terrible wrongs to set to rights.  you have a weighty job of coping with a failing system, with rapid and rapidly-accelerating disruptive technological change.  you have both the painful burden and the delightful freedom of reinventing yourselves and the system you live in, as our current system fails and dies off.  it sounds like you are in the process of finding yourself.  running away to thailand sounds to me like a very creative and interesting act of rebellion against the expectations, against the system that was supposed to work.  you come across as very articulate and self aware.  these attributes will serve you well in what is to come.  i understand all too well your feelings of betrayal.  for what its worth there are many of us who realized the system had no use for us, in the first place.  my best to you.

I'm saying our experiences, limitations, and opportunities have surprising similarities when looked at in overview mode.  i guess the TL;DR would be: every generational group has simultaneously a painful burden and a breathtaking opportunity.  it varies and yet is similar, for each group.  don't let anyone tell you who you are, who you can become, based on when you were born.  because every life is so astonishingly, fractally individual  when i let myself think about it I'm terrified about whats going to happen as time goes on.  just like you guys.  but, on the plus side, i have the greatest connections and exchanges with people.  thats one thing that keeps me going.  that plus being an artist, a designer.  even on the scariest days i have joy in tiny details, absurdly beautiful details.  Edit: adding:  you guys are already changing things massively.  much to the bewilderment of the Donald Trumps of the world, haha.  business models like Uber and AirBnB, creating smash-hit startups while you're in your early 20s, becoming the absolute gods of coding, and wonderful collectivist types of ideas like makerspaces and hackathons.  open source coding FTW!  the Internet of Things!  not to mention that the sports you guys unleashed on the world are just jaw-droppingly amazing.  my list is far from well rounded, please help me complete it  =;-)"

I am a lot older than you and we all knew even back then that working hard and getting an education was not the entire story. As far as I know there has never been a time where there were such guarantees. Knowing what I know from a lifetime of observation I would say that education, hard work, preparation, perseverance, and positive attitude are the way to go towards creating a successful life for yourself. If you know a better strategy let me know. I do not know you age, but it took me until about 34 years of age to consider myself secure and on the road to success. When I was in my teens I had being drafted into a war to anticipated. After my years in the military and years in the university I went out into a recession economy and the largest number of young people ever entering the economy and competing for jobs. From what I see the young people are on the verge of having great job possibilities open up as the largest group of workers ever leave their jobs. When they leave the things they are doing will still need to be done. You want work to do? Here it comes."

They're not adding much in the way of empathy by doing this. They're also not addressing the millennial generation's particularly fucked prospects. We're paying 1200% more than the previous generations did for our education and, at the same time, seeing a general devaluation of all education. I bought my degree on the assumption that the job market would go on getting better as it did before the crash and that I'd recoup my expenses easily. This hasn't been the case. Hindsight is 20/20, and I've learned that bad things will happen to good people. Starving times will come, and with this in mind I don't want to take any risks. This is the lot of our generation - doomed to stagnant careers until we're middle aged.

What I said with this post is I'm going to stop being so critical of myself for the fact I can't get a job because its true for most of us born in the 80s and growing up in the 90s. I need to stop expecting things to be how I was led to believe they would be and accept them for how they are.  I follow the Stoic mind set of accepting that you can't control how others react to you. I can do my very best when applying for jobs and interviews but I have no control on how prospective employers think or make decisions. We do not have control over as much as people think we do.

Changing just one for the positive can really change your outlook.  Don't despair about which age should be the most fun. My late 20s and hitting 30 were more fun in a lot of ways. It's not too late.

Asking these questions means that you want it, now all you have to do is make it happen. Start with something small. For example every morning (or once week) take a walk around the block. (The air will do you some good and help you relax a little.) Then start adding something else to the little changes rotation. Maybe adding another block or riding a bicycle. Just whatever. You need to find something to help get out of your head once in a while. Also everything does work out in the end in some way. Yes maybe it sucks now, but maybe it doesn't suck as bad as you think.  To sum up... get out of your head. You are stronger than you realize."

DecidingToBeBetter,3cj8fo,weirdoceans,4,Wed Jul 8 09:50:33 2015 UTC,"I did this for a while. Sometimes it's hard not to. It was for me. So I talked about it. Group therapy helped me out a lot. I talked to people I wanted to talk with about what kept popping up. I talked about what I wanted to do to the other person and I moved on. I didn't stay the victim. I usually after venting some anger was like oh well that's over now I learned not all people are good. Or if I wanted to I would say I forgive that guy for doing what he did to me. I don't forgive him necessarily for his sake but more for my own. I need to forgive him because this anger and resentment I'm holding towards this person is just hurting me in the end. He's long gone out of my life but the more I hold onto what should've or could've been or how I felt violated or like a punk or whatever it may be the more power I'm giving that person. By focusing all my energy on him-- even if it's hate or whatever--im letting him live rent free in my head. That and also I live by the philosophy that the best revenge in life is to make yourself extremely successful.   So i think of what makes me mad or whatever and I think. What can I do that will make me better?what will get me what I want? And I focus on that and move on. Also, what I'm doing now. Helping another person. That will help you too. By going through whatever you went through you have a unique perspective that only others who have gone through the same thing can relate to. So use that to help someone struggling with what you are. Remember to be greatful. If even that just the trauma is over. Hope you do well!"

I sometimes go to the website, set myself as Online and only reply to people who specifically want to talk to me. So far it's been alright.

I vented at a listener and they say things like ""I'm sorry to hear"" or ""that must be hard."" It was effective in that I basically talked myself into feeling better because I couldn't rely on a third party to do it for me, so in that case it works.   I signed up as a listener for a short time, and pretty much broke all the rules. I had two or three very long chats that were intimate and honest. Real connection. The people said it was the best they've had. But all the training says to never give advise, practice active listening, validate everything they say and just let them talk themselves into feeling better.   In a way I agree with that method because as listeners it's important to be present and ""hold the space"" for another person to go through their feelings without having someone else ""fix"" them or analyze them.   But i do have a problem with how impersonal that approach is. Especially over chat when you can't make eye contact or facial expressions. Empathy and compassion from someone, even a stranger, goes a long way. If it feels like emotional tech support, that's commoditizing real human relationships and turning it into a factory/machine - which kills the spirit of talking to a real person."

I was thinking, ""Maybe I can talk someone through their problem and help them out with it."" NOPE. Instead, they teach you active listening which is essentially IT, as you all have said. It went horribly wrong when I tried it. I tried talking to a few people to help them but it felt so impersonal to just repeat what they said since I am not allowed to give them any advice. Listeners essentially bounce back to you what you said. :(  For example (fictitious conversation - they have you sign a waiver not to talk about real convos): ""I don't know what to do. I'm wigging out because of all these finals coming up and my mom's really putting some pressure on me to excel in school, like it's the only thing she cares about that I do. Sound mind? Pfft. Dean's list? Now we're talking.""   My response is supposed to be something like: ""So you're frustrated that your mother wants you to do well in school and it feels that is the only thing she cares about."" We're supposed to basically repeat what they said to us. That's it. Or say something empathetic like, ""That sounds like you have a lot on your plate. I can understand how that would stress you out."" But nothing past that. No offering advice. Nothing constructive or suggesting therapeutic things. Just repeating it in a fancier way.   If you have a lot on your chest and you just wanna let it out to someone without any sort of judgment (or hardly any conversation at all, just someone there to unload on), 7 Cups of Tea is definitely the place for the most part (if you request someone who has amazing reviews). Unfortunately, many people go on there actually wanting advice. They're juggling some heavy personal situations that are distressing them and they want someone to advise them.   I was a total nervous wreck when I couldn't help the people I talked to. I think I really discouraged them from asking for help. :/"

However, I think the worry is based on living in the future. You are dissapointed about the past. In other words you are not spending enough time in the present and that is why your future looks like an impossible mountain to climb. You will only be able to be happy if you learn to start being content about where you are at. Also the fact that you just broke it off with somebody you may also be mourning that relationship and it is ok to be sad and I wouldn't try to move past that too quickly it is a process. It is funny on how sometimes when we learn to be content with our situation we can start to visualize a better future and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. I hope this helps."

So some things that I hope can make a difference for you as they do for me. They are easy to write and say so know that I fall every now and then also.  The most important and hardest thing is to keep yourself in the present and not dwell in the past or worry about the future.   Failure is experience, don't pull or fall into the abyss just because you mess up one time, one day or such. Learn from what happens, keep what worked and find solutions for what didn't.  Be mindful of your thoughts. If they are negative, take notice of them and move on. The faster you can let go the faster you can move on.

Drinking a lot less is the second. Stopping most (but not all) video gaming is the third.  Even if you just take some simple steps to start, you will be amazed at how much of a push those small steps will give you to continue on.  I realized the only thing in my way is myself. Once I had this realization (and no excuses) I just started doing what needs to be done. Getting out of my shitty job will be my next thing and that is where I'm at a roadblock. The job is very depressing despite its pay. Either way, the only time something is going to change is when I get off my ass and change it.  It's very easy to get depressed/down anymore about the state of the world, our lives, etc. I stopped reading most news. There are ways to be baseline ""informed"" without letting the media be so psychologically affecting. This has helped my view of society.

We all have our bad habits or escapes that we fall into (video games, Internet browsing, alcohol, Netflix, sugar, etc). Have you identified your go-to comforts for when you're feeling overwhelmed? Have you cbosen something ahead of time to fall back on as a healthier option for coping with stress or a down-turn? This is a new idea for me that came up today from thinking about your post. I will be observing myself and watching for when I want to escape (mine are sugar and Internet, sometimes Netflix).

Wiggle your arms while you're sitting there on the couch. Do some curls while you watch TV. Don't treat it like it has to be this compartmentalized thing. Figure out how you're going to stop smoking cigarettes, straight up. If you can cold turkey, then have some willpower and be a man about it. If you recognize that you'll struggle, look up e-cigs (there's great subreddits here to help you out), patches, the nic pill, gum, whatever. Do whatever you need to, just figure out what's gonna work for you. Stick. To. It. Hold yourself accountable. Get neurotic about it, annoy your friends; do whatever. Get a fuckin' hobby. It's cool if alcohol can be a part of it (beers and bowling are a good combo), but you need to figure out what makes you feel good about yourself that isn't so destructive.   There's no secret to it, there's no tricks. If you're apathetic it's because you don't care. If you wanna change it's because you do. So you have to ask yourself, do you want to? And if you do, then... well, simple as that you just better start doing it. Something, anything. When you get yourself a little more active, a little less smoke, a little more care, THEN you can work on tackling a mountain or some decathlon stuff. Right now it's about small lifestyle changes.  That's your goal, change in lifestyle. Be that change, starting right now. All it takes is picking 1 thing and doing  it repeatedly, next thing you know it's part of your identity.  I sincerely believe in your ability to change, but understand that whatever change you're looking for isn't going to come from external pressure.

Don't hold anything back. Admit your flaws and failures. Then forgive yourself. It's crucial to accept and forgive yourself. You're learning how to be a friend... to you. You'd forgive a friend (or SO) their faults and mistakes, wouldn't you? Now that you're being so open, open yourself up to forgiveness and friendship.   Then, what would a friend do for someone who needs help? Be that friend to yourself. Make no mistake, you probably can't make it on your own. You're going to need help from others. But you're still gonna have to rely on yourself, to keep yourself in line, to forgive you when you fall, and to support yourself when you have to pick yourself up again and keep on going.  Low self esteem isn't going to help you. It's gonna hurt. You can't just beat yourself up. You have to see yourself as someone worth saving. Stop thinking that you're the worst. It's defeatist thinking. Work on your self esteem. You may have issues, possibly poor self image, social anxiety, or clinical depression. We don't know. We can't diagnose you. But if you think you might have such issues, you'll need help. Get that help.   In the meantime, physical exercise is good. Take it easy, you're a smoker. Don't do too much. But a little time in the gym, or running... well, maybe walking for now... do something. It will help your mood and your self discipline and it will lead to a more positive self image."

I never got all that bad, but I held onto that old bad habit of a-couple-to-several-drinks-a-day like a life raft, just because ""everybody else"" drinks, only to start trying to completely can that habit this year. Old college habits die hard. All this to point out: consider dropping booze. The cumulative effects of even moderate alcohol consumption stack up pretty fast for people who tend to be depressed. Just my experience.   Other stuff that helps/ has helped me:  Exercise- get comfortable with working hard on fitness. I only figured this out at ~32, and it would have been SO much better to start a few years earlier. You don't have to be a gym rat, just move more. Walk the dog morning and night, take up a martial art, go dancing with your girlfriend. Whatever- just find sustainable ways to regularly work hard on your meat body. Your mind/ soul/ self has to ride around in it, and it's happier when said body is running right.  Nutrition- learn to cook and start tracking your moods and paying attention to how what you eat affects those. There is often a correlation there. The old saw ""you are what you eat"" has a lot of validity. You don't have to become a kale-smoothie guy overnight (or ever) to do better- assuming you're American there is about a 110% chance you could eat healthier, so start. Take a multivitamin, maybe some fish oil and a vitamin d supplement, too- nothing expensive or exotic, just plain old stuff. Those help, too.  Sleep: get more.

Sleep is when your body heals  and recharges itself, and our society has deprioritized it to an incredible, stupid degree. Figure out how to set yourself a bedtime, stick to it; figure out a good time to get up, stick to that too. Drinking less plays in here- the QUALITY of sleep matters and passing out doesn't count, at least not for much.  Spirituality: don't know if you're religious (I'm not, at all) but I have found a great deal of wisdom and self-help in examining world religions and other philosophies. For me, it's just a way of contextualizing our shared human struggle, and sort of reminding myself that others have felt like I do at other times. Although every experience you have is new (to you) in the particular, few are, overall, unique in aggregate. All people will experience joy, heartbreak, pleasure, pain, depression, love, loss, etc. - in my opinion, at least, some self examination and thought there is helpful and healthy. One other thing here- practice gratitude. You don't have to pray or give thanks to God/Allah/Buddha/FSM- just get in the habit each day of spending a couple minutes thinking of something you are glad to have in or going on in your life. That alone helps, so so much.  Word fort ended. Glad to expound more if you care to hear it- shoot me a pm or reply."

It's so unsettling, to wake up from a dream where you know the content doesn't make sense but it feels so real and you're still shaken up about it.  Therapy has helped me tremendously, as well as medication.  I take gabapentin right before I go to bed and I don't have nightmares.  Other than that, I read somewhere that low blood sugar can impact nightmares, so I'll eat something mildly sugary (like a container of mandarin oranges) right before bed just to be on the safe side.  Hard to tell if it works though because gabapentin does such a good job.  You'll be amazed though, once you get your sleep right your mood improves throughout the day.  Hope all this helps and you find some relief soon :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,3cfb2x,annerd3,2,Tue Jul 7 15:52:00 2015 UTC,"I've had horrible night terrors for the past 22 years, and I'm not sure why. When I was 3 I started dreaming that my mom was killed, and in the dreams I felt the weight of her death afterwards. I became clingy to her; completely afraid to leave her side. Going to school was hard, going to friends' house was near impossible. I was so scared she would die and I would regret not spending enough time with her. The nightmares continued into high school, where they transferred from mom to my first long term boyfriend. I'd have death dreams at least twice a week, each time it took the entire day for me to realize that it wasn't real and sometimes two days for me to emotionally come to terms with it. They got so bad that I would wake up screaming and crying, then convince myself that the person who died in my dreams was actually dead and this person in front of me was actually a ghost. I thought my subconscious was preparing me for dealing inevitable death. I'm 25 now, and still have these dreams. It usually only happens during that time of the month now, and I can usually get emotionally over it within 2 hours. I've been to therapy for it, and the only advice I've found helps is journaling every nightmare, and then how I feel about it in that moment. Sometimes I need another person to bring me back to reality, so having your girlfriend be your support system is a good thing.   TL;DR Keep a dream journal and continue talking about them to someone you trust."

It's perfectly fine to seek out different careers.  As for dating - feeling better about yourself is your number one priority.  If you feel that you're overweight - you said it yourself, it's easy to fix.  I don't think you're in that dire of a situation.  You seem to have family and friends.

Be frugal, don't buy things unless you really think you need them. Once you have a chunk of change, go somewhere far away. If you have a car, drive. If you don't, take a bus or train or whatever. Pick somewhere that is drastically different from where you live now. Don't listen if people tell you not to leave. Throw caution to the wind! I think you need to go on an adventure and find yourself. You need to put yourself in a situation where you are uncomfortable and a little scared to figure out who you really are. I think complete independence is the direction you need to be going."
DecidingToBeBetter,3cc8tp,konig_k,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:12:34 2015 UTC,"Hey there,  Sounds like you continually set yourself to stop things rather than fail.  You are hypersensitive, however you have allowed your excuses to be your daily ritual and now are just bad habits.  Your mind is set on failing and then beating yourself up, with self loathing and hopelessness.   Can I recommend the carrot theory?  To change your mind set.  The first week all you have to do is eat a carrot.  Nothing else.  But you must commit because you are rewiring your brain.    You may have five carrots (to eat over a five day period) and one of your family members eats the last one.  When you go to get it at 7.00pm of an evening there is no carrot.  You have to walk miles to get this one carrot because all you have to do on the first week is eat a carrot.  Commit to it and preferably eat it at a set time, but if this is not possible as long as it is one a day for seven days.    The second week shake it up a bit.  Go on, continue with the carrot but maybe change it to an apple.  And commit to something else - say a five minute walk.  Only five minutes, it does not matter if you sprain your leg, you crawl that five minutes, why?  Because you are rewiring the mind.    The the third week, change your commitment back to the carrot, up the walk to ten minutes and then add something else, but you choose.  Only five minutes.  You are not looking to overload.  Another piece of advice is to challenge yourself in about six months or less to go and do an eight week course of some sort of self defense.  You prepare yourself, for feeling uncomfortable, you prepare to be scared, you prepare for your mind to yell and scream at you ""no"" and all that comes with it.  And you do it anyway.  Embrace getting comfortable with feeling uncomfortable."

DecidingToBeBetter,3cc8tp,lemon_vampire,5,Mon Jul 6 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"I think what lemon_vampire is getting at in their own special way is that you need to get disciplined about your life choices. By the sounds of your post, OP, you're an intelligent, self-reflective person who already knows where they can do better. The ""how"" is all about just sucking it up and doing what you know you need to do.  Write down your major goals (which, based on the above look to me like : get in shape via diet and exercise, learn some emotional control when it comes to people you live with and your anxiety, get a job in your field when your licence comes in, and get in the dating game). Now, make short term goals that you can check off EVERY DAY that get you closer to your long-term goals. Set reminders in your phone or take 5 minutes at the beginning and end of every day to review your daily goals and reflect on how you can do better the next day. Short term goals might be: don't eat sugar/take out, eat lots of vegetables, do a 30 minute work out, catch yourself whenever you feel your self getting frustrated with your family and don't say anything until you settle down a bit. Get a portfolio together to present to potential employers, not just a cover letter and resume. Also, its important that you deal with your anxiety if you're going to be an EMT. Test anxiety is one thing, but you're going to be faced with some intense situations and you need to be able to recall your training under pressure. As far as meeting women goes, get out to some social events related to your hobbies, ask your friends to set you up with someone, lower your standards for awhile until you get some dates under your belt (heh), and just be honest about not having dated many people if its making you feel weird around someone (if you're a not bad looking guy with a good personality like you say you are, no one's going to care that you're inexperienced).  Lastly, you need to learn that screwing up and falling off the wagon doesn't mean that you have to stop trying. The more you fail and recover quickly from it, the less often it'll happen. Its all about shortening those periods of wagon-fall-off-ed-ness. Instead of breaking your diet and eating junk food for a few weeks, just catch yourself doing it, feel gross about it, and get started again immediately by making your next meal healthy. Don't get discouraged, get disciplined and motivated. Join /r/getdisciplined and read the top posts.  Personally, I'm procrastinating from studying for a big job interview / test tomorrow and I just noticed that I'm just rambling on here, so I'm going to take my own advice and STOP what I'm doing and make the better choice, which is the thing I know I need to go do, which is study.  Best of luck to you!"

DecidingToBeBetter,3ca9sb,saltenslash,2,Tue Jul 7 02:30:07 2015 UTC,"I would recommend facing it head on. It will be uncomfortable at first, but once you realize fear is something you can control based on your own objective perception it's really not so bad. Fear isn't something that should control you, it should be a tool in the sense of an indication of something else in your life that you need to overcome to move forward. It really is something you can get over once and for all, and when you do life becomes a lot more enjoyable. The best way to do it, again, is to swallow that little bit of doubt and force yourself to rationalize and break down your fears for what they are. If you submerge yourself in the fear you have a greater chance of finding the root cause, and from my own personal experience, the root cause is usually not at all that scary. I know this poorly written, but I hope that it helps."

DecidingToBeBetter,3ca9sb,Homerjunior_NoOpen,2,Tue Jul 7 02:36:39 2015 UTC,"I firstly acknowledge what type of fear is it. Is it a rational fear, an irrational one, is it all encompassing and debilitating or is it minor and insignificant? Once I know the answer I can deal with it accordingly. I have found when I deal with fear I face it head on. Take singing in front of people for an example. Yes, it's scary and yes my hands shake and I'm about sick before hand but... I can do it. It doesn't control me and the more often I do it, the less I fear it. If I want to purge that fear from my body I do it as often as possible in larger and larger groups until it has no affect on me any longer. Amazingly some of the larger ones are easier to deal with as opposed to the irrational ones like spiders. I can over come big fears such as quitting a job/starting a new business, singing in front of a crowd, going some place I've never been and trying something totally out of my comfort zone without anyone to show me the way, but I cannot stop my fear of spiders. I could probably swim with sharks or sky dive but let a spider crawl on me... fuck that shit."

While always having hated 'the media' it was painfull how my 'social' circle started to behave much like media outlets; superficial, one-sided and never recognizing flaws of simply being humans.  Maybe 15 of my social media connections I still saw offline, on occasion. I've deleted Facebook and have found that out of those 15, the 15 are still all there. They did have to adjust to inviting me personally instead of inviting everyone at one platform; but they still do so or I hear from other routes what's goin on. In essence; if I get forgotten because im not in a facebook pick-list; I am very ok with that. The thing is; I want people in my life whom think of me and include me without technology reminders; but just out of normal social care / companionship. No technology can replace that, cause that, grow that like nature/offline relations can. Tech communication is still a handicapped version of verbal/non-verbal live communication; as like popularity online is still like winning the paralympics. Internet is still in puberty, don't let that technology brat influence your true life and relationships. We human have amazing underestimated communicationskills by ourselves. My response to my friend telling me he bought a new house is worth 2000x more to him when face-to-face then a 'like' on handy and some colorful database application. Only when you get consious about this you can start gaining back the meaningful moments which 'social media' took from your social life.  I am glad and proud to be off that database designed for addictive behaviour; my social life improved; actual conversations improved; my personal skills and interests have improved. Mostly; my peace of mind is mine again; less cluttered; giving appropriate attention to things/people where fit instead of rushing through 'updates'.  It's nice to see the world can connect and see all are equal; but that's no reason to forget about sharing a moment with your actual neighbours, investing in local society, or improving yourself by wishes from your soul instead of external influences..  Bla, that was my rant. Good on you for quitting facebook.. We got this great de-centralized communication technology; internet. While it being focussed to be de-centralized; we the people have chosen to centralize under someone's corporate banner to be profited upon.

I used it a lot, made a lot of cool friends, had some great (and not great) experiences, but it became a popularity contest, and I was always comparing myself to others by how many favourites or retweets I got. I'd tweet something I thought was great and it would get no response despite ~1,000 followers and I would get really down about it. When I stopped working and studying from home full-time, I no longer had anything fun to say, and I didn't care for the people I would be saying them to, so I just stopped.

It is draining emotionally and the people who are ""friends"" are really just acquaintances for the most part.   Glad you were able to take a break from it!  It's good for clarity."

Facebook was a vastly different landscape when I first joined nearly a decade ago (wow), but now it seems like a school of goldfish fighting over a single breadcrumb, and just a revolving carousel of  ~25 things reposted over and over each week, with 5 new things added to the mix every week that passes by...and none of it is anything I particularly care about at all. I had convinced myself as a musician that I needed it to network out and all this and that...now as a somewhat freelance music journalist, I use it to see what shows are in the area and to post my work. It might be a slight detriment to getting my work out there, but I think it will force me to work harder at it...so maybe I will delete this disease after I post my latest work and make sure people who need to get ahold of me can through other means of communication.

Of course, feel free to include a small ""fun"" budget line; the point of a budget is simply to make a plan and stick to it, not to make you miserable.   For the cooking issue, make sure you're all set to go in the kitchen well before dinner, either in the morning or on the weekends. Make sure the kitchen and your tools are all clean and ready to go. Make sure you allot time to go grocery shopping regularly so that you have food with which to cook. Find some dead easy recipes to start out, like sandwiches or crock pot ""dump"" recipes. Your goal should be to make something that is just decent enough so that you aren't eating out; don't try to do anything fancy or gourmet.

Check out the book ""Hooked"" by ""Nir Eyal"" for more insight into how you're being made an addict.  In my experience i think your solution may come from refocussing/re-evaluating the worth of your time. Your time is limited; so check again what's it worth to you; how much you think you spend on violin, how much you got left for others. Do that in the global estimate area, but also your daily activities; like hey, the first 4 hrs of the day; im just gonna do this/that/that; and having sticked to the 4 hrs is the true reward; not the activities you done in em. Extend those hours later, again and again; till full days and repeating.  We want tomorrow to be different, so lets adjust today a bit so tomorrow will have a higher chance of succeeding.  Edit: the des-interest; yes your experience is right; your brain refuses.

DecidingToBeBetter,3c9xu4,konig_k,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:21:19 2015 UTC,"Hey,   So, I am glad to see that you are aware of yourself and your habits because for most people being aware of themselves is the hardest challenge to overcome, so be thankful for that.  My suggestion to you is to approach tasks in a different way than just getting good at a skill. Think about the enjoyment in the process of getting good at something rather than the final product.   In my experience I have found that in trying to learn something, I end up learning a lot about something that is totally unrelated to what I initially planned.  If you are interested in video games and art I think animation is definitely a good place to go. A few years ago I started learning 3d modelling and animation and it is a very gratifying task in both the short term and long term. Check out Blender http://www.blender.org/. It is a free modeling program with amazing capabilities. It might just be what you're looking for. And instead of looking at random youtube videos start spending your time watching tutorials on how to use Blender. From there it should just domino effect into more things you may be interested in.  Final thing I want to mention is, even as cliche as it may sound, live every day like it is your last. Try not to regret a single day in your life. Also, as Alan Watts said ""It is better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. I hope this helps. Good luck!"

Violin is fine, because it isn't permanent and people kind of understand when they hear the screeching of a bow against strings ""oh, he's learning"". I find there's more scrutiny with drawing, so its really hard to find outside support for it.  Self-consciousness is a confusing thing. It tells me that I need to be practicing the things I suck at, then tells me I suck at the things I'm practicing. As you can imagine, its easier to just shut it out and watch 50 episodes of a mildly entertaining Bloodborn LP."

Nobody deserves to have a girlfriend just because they are lonely and feeling self pity.  What kind of self respecting woman would want to win that particular booby prize?  Would you want a relationship with a girl who thought she was only worth third best?  These people aren't hard to find and if you want to kill your soul jump on one.  It is not rational to be dependent on another person, especially one you know only superficially.  I long had a tendency to fall in love with any girl who did not immediately reject me.  This is not how to be happy.  Ultimately happiness is a decision and a learned behaviour.  It just does not come from outside or from another person's validation.

They will always suck, and there's no fixing that.  However: I have learned that, through bettering myself, you can minimize the inevitable disruption in your own life, as well as better your position for future relationships, romantic or otherwise. (Read: stop taking baggage from previous relationships with you.)  You have to learn to be better at being alone. It's terrifying and not a natural state of being. We're all social creatures in one way or another. But put it this way: you make a relationship with someone, you're building something together. Working on yourself sets the foundation of that structure. If you dig your alone time, you probably have a strong foundation. If you look for self-worth within the opinions of others (as I had for many years), your foundation is fluctuating, unstable, unreliable. Like building a house on wet sand.  The trick is to be alone without isolating. Go outside. Do something that gets the blood going. Walk to a park with your lunch and eat it and just watch and listen to stuff. Go to a movie by yourself. Look into classes at libraries, learning centers, stores, community colleges, whatever. All of these suggestions will sound very cliche, because there's a nugget of truth inside them.  Don't isolate. Do stuff. Be the person you want to be your best friend.

Depression is not about you, it is about a lot of things including possibly chemistry.   Depression is a treatable disease that ruins your life minute by minute, and you go to a GP first to discuss the idea. You may be referred to a therapist or endocrinologist who may help or not; if not you return to your GP for a different referral.   Depression can come from absurdly mundane causes. My body wastes magnesium. I found that out by chance. My Mg levels are really low naturally, and low Mg and depression are correlated pretty well. A cheap supplement is all I need to take to not be depressed, and it is really nice to not be depressed.   Please, get started, find out what can help you, because something will and wasting more time on the road to finding it is... well, wasted time. I really hope you check that out thoroughly, because the alternative is a day-by-day drip feed of feeling awful."

There are a wide variety of types of therapy available and you should go with something/someone that makes you feel comfortable.   It's been said but definitely look into services offered at your school, many campuses provide free mental health services to students (there are usually credit hour requirements). If you don't feel like you can continue at school, looking for an outside therapist is also okay. If money is a concern (assuming you're in the US?) Call 211 and/or ask about sliding scale payment options when contacting folks.   Social workers tend to take a whole environment approach whereas psychologists and psychiatrists tend to take a medical model approach, ymmv with results based on what you're looking for and how you work best.   It's easy to say that there's no reason to be ashamed or scared or worried about starting therapy but it's okay that you feel that way.

DecidingToBeBetter,3c98ru,bobodod,2,Mon Jul 6 03:12:24 2015 UTC,"Sure! So, an environmental approach takes you and your environment into account when providing assessments and taking account of what's going on whereas a medical model focuses on diagnosing a problem with you.   So an example could be if I have a problem with my feet, they're hurting a lot. If I went to someone using a medical model, they might say that my feet need special shoes but if I went to someone using an environmental approach they might ask about where I walk and how much and what kinds of shoes I wear, maybe I walk on uneven ground and that's hurting my feet. That's a stupid example but I hope it illustrates my point."

So swallow your pride, humble the fuck up and talk to real people that know how to swim. Go with friends. I'm sure they'll love to teach you if you demonstrate the desire to learn. There are few joys in this world like teaching an eager student.   If that's not going fast enough for you get an instructor. Get the basic techniques down solid and build off off that. Like anything in life, a strong foundation is key. Don't try to speed through that. Enjoy the process and watch yourself improve.

I've taught several high school aged kids to swim after they grew up without ever touching the water. It took several weeks of helping them to float in the water, learning how to breathe and get to a wall in case they felt like they were drowning. For months after I still had to be ready to jump in at any second and I did once with one of these kids. Do yourself and any lifeguard a favor and talk to your local pool about swimming lessons. Swimming is a really important life skill and you should learn how from a professional for your safety."

Granted, OP probably doesn't run that much risk, but still. It's never ""Safe enough""  -You'll teach yourself wrong in shallow water. Deep water isn't the same as shallow water, and fast water isn't the same as standing water. Maybe OP'll learn to keep his head above the water, but that's not the same as swimming. It's deteriorative in the long run  -Besides that, this self-tought style of swimming is pretty evident. All his friends will see that he can barely swim.

I personally had to teach myself swimming because instructors in my city are few and don't teach anything beyond a flutter kick. Heck there are just four pools in my city. I can say I have taught myself to be a more or less a basic swimmer and know the basic drills.   For me the alternative of not learning on my own would be to drown if I ever fall in water. How is that a better alternative to teaching oneself at the shallow end with someone else watching.   PS: Excuse my grammar; non-native English speaker here.
DecidingToBeBetter,3c65ly,VeryPrivate,5,Mon Jul 6 08:28:00 2015 UTC,"There's already been some good advice here but I'd like to add that's it's important you stay calm and relaxed when swimming. When your muscles are tensed up you're more likely to sink, a relaxed body is more likely to float."
DecidingToBeBetter,3c65ly,sabr0sa,5,Sun Jul 5 06:15:24 2015 UTC,"All the following assumes you stay in the shallow end.  Make it FUN.  Eliminate anything that creates anxiety while in the pool, because practically speaking, that will limit the fun factor and reduce the chance of spending enough time to learn.  Better to go slow and have fun than to get yourself ""in over your head"" (pun intended).   Swim in a place with a life-guard.  Let the life-guard(s) know that you don't know how to swim and are learning so he/she can keep an eye out for you. The most important  thing of all is to learn how to float horizontally.  On your back face up.  And face down (coming up for air when needed).  Increase the amount of time you can float.  Relax. One of the tricks for floating on your back is where your arms are.  Extend arms  above your head (horizontally speaking, they're still in the water) and you'll float easily.  As you bring your arms to your sides (straight out from your body), you'll notice your body starts to  go vertical in the water and sink. Learn how to swim from one side to the other completely under water.  Work on increasing your under water distance swimming. For some games, reduce the amount of time you touch the bottom.  But also remember that many real drownings occur in water that is shallow enough for people to stand (sadly, they just panic). Play fetch.   Throw items into the pool and retrieve them. Learn how to do forward flips and back flips while underwater.  It's really easy... just swinging your arms around forwards or backwards as you tuck into a ball.  You can work up to multiple flips.   Definitely find someone that can teach you.  But some teachers are better than others.  You might want to go ahead and get some training from multiple teachers so you can get a feel for their different styles so you can choose the one you're most comfortable with."

DecidingToBeBetter,3c65ly,Hipstermankey,7,Sun Jul 5 09:12:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would practice breathing. That is the art of blowing out bubbles under water.   That is the biggest thing that a non swimmer has to ""fear"" as such is water getting up the nose, and full immersion of one's head. Practice bobbing under the water and blowing bubbles in a forceful stream as you push your head above the water. Get used to opening your eyes under water. If you have a heavily chlorinated pool use goggles or they will get sore. See if you can get used to the pressure on your ears and your head being underwater with out panicking.   Practice flutter kicks - on the edge of the pool and notice how buoyant the body feels - Get a sturdy kick board and practice your flutter kicking whilst pushing the kick board in front of you. Get a pool noodle and try using that.   Once you feel comfy with that sign up for swim school - they will start to get the basics of swimming strokes for you."

DecidingToBeBetter,3c65ly,MoshPotato,2,Sun Jul 5 15:48:20 2015 UTC,"It's a common problem and fear that one. What you understand as a swimmer after a while, is you control your buoyancy to an extent. Whales for example breathe air the same as we do, but do amazing things with air bubbles from netting to communication. They know that if they need to breathe in they need to do that in air, not water. And there is always enough air above the water.   When I'm doing breast stroke (my favorite swim stroke) I suck in air, hold it as I immerse my head under, then breathe out just as I surface pushing water away from my nose and mouth. Your body has some natural buoyancy - but you need to work with your breathing to achieve that.   When I'm floating on my back (a very peaceful process) I'm chest up; strong breathing with very shallow exhales with the rest of my body some what submerged. Diving and to an extent Scuba - also relies on breathing and submerging to give you lift and buoyancy in the water. Try using a fins and flippers set with a snorkel. That's a good start in getting over the fear of water."

I find it the most freeing thing in the world as long as I'm wearing goggles; without them, it's scary.   Part of it is just getting to the place where you know you are not going to drown. Not that you think you won't.  I wholeheartedly agree with the response about floating on your back. If you keep your lungs mostly full, you won't sink. I love doing this in the ocean and letting waves roll over me and take me where it wants. I do not recommend this if you aren't comfortable, but this is a great thing to do in the pool. You can relax, close your eyes get a nice tan (UV rays are focused under water), the water in your ears blocks out the world. Just concentrate on breathing slowing and evenly. you can dunk your forehead and your eyes as long as your mouth and nose are mostly out of the water."
DecidingToBeBetter,3c65ly,Costco1L,3,Sun Jul 5 23:20:17 2015 UTC,"I taught swim lessons for several years and a few adult classes. The adult classes were usually one on one. You can learn to swim at a depth you could stand up in. Once your comfortable and confident floating it'll unlock a lot of potential. But swim lessons would work too, and you shouldn't feel bad about it at all. I respected adults willing to take swim lessons for the first time. But I would stay at a depth you could stand up in until you're 100% confident."

If you panic or can't get it the first few times, stand up. Repeat until you feel confident and you're not panicking   After that it becomes a bit harder (and dangerous) to progress to 'underwater' strokes and you'll likely need a friend or someone else to watch you.

DecidingToBeBetter,3c65ly,_Bobbin,2,Sun Jul 5 15:40:08 2015 UTC,"I learned to swim when I was 30! I started at my local YMCA in an adult class. It didn't work too well for me. One of the instructors put me in touch with a person that does private lessons. In 1 lesson I floated, by myself! At the second lesson, I swam for the first time.   The lessons weren't cheap & at the time I wasn't making a lot of money. It was worth every penny though.  I'm not a great swimmer by any means, but it was so empowering to conquer my fear of water."
DecidingToBeBetter,3c65ly,Costco1L,2,Sun Jul 5 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"Start in water you can stand in.      Hold the edge of the pool with both hands.      Kick your legs back and forth (start right foot forward, left foot back and go to left foot forward, right foot back, go back to original stance and just keep doing it). If you are doing this properly then your legs will raise in the water.      Then try just the arms. Bring right arm up and then bring it down forward to scoop the water with your hand, bring that hand underwater to your side. Alternate the same thing between right and left hand.      Tread water. Basically, flail your arms just below the surface of the water while keeping your feet off the floor (bend knees in like you are sitting).  When you are comfortable with these techniques, work your way along the edge deeper into the pool while practicing your feet techniques. When you are comfortable let go of the edge and try treading water at a depth you can't touch the bottom. If it works, then combine the techniques you've been practicing and you're swimming."

When you're comfortable treading water, try using only your legs actively and then try doing it as lazily as possible.

If you learn to keep your lungs mostly full (again, in a relaxed way), it really doesn't take much effort to stay afloat."
DecidingToBeBetter,3c65ly,Gekoman,2,Sun Jul 5 23:23:46 2015 UTC,"Do you have any friends that do know how to swim? Do not attempt any of the following without someone making sure you don't fuck up a kill yourself.   Is there a swimming pool you have access to? The first steps are acclimating yourself to water. Start in the shallow end. Wade around for a while. Crouch down, get used to water up to your waist, chest, and neck.  Next is breathing. Still crouching in shallow water. Take a deep breath and try to hold your head under water for 3 seconds, keep your mouth closed and exhale through your nose if necessary. Once you can do that consistently, practice holding your breath for longer and longer until you can do 10 seconds consistently.  Now to learn a bit about buoyancy,  you're going to attempt to float. This more than anywhere else is when you should have a spotter, I'm really not kidding about this. First, lean back in the water and spread out your arms and legs until you're parallel to the water surface, your spotter can help hold you up until you are comfortable. Keep your chin up, lower your ears into the water and arch your back upwards a bit. Keep your head centered, your arms out, and your knees bent (kick a little if you feel your legs sinking) a good spotter can gently let you go as you learn to make small adjustments to remain afloat.  Next is kicking. Most of your propulsion while swimming comes from your legs. Get a firm grip on the side of the pool and hold yourself out flat on your belly on the surface of the water (your friend may need to lend a hand here, you brought your friend, right?) now kick. Simple alternating up and down movement for both legs simultaneously. Keep your head out of the water until you get the hang of it then use your breathing practice to try to keep your head down for 3 seconds while kicking and coming up for air.  At this point I think it's prudent to point out the need to take regular breaks, swimming can be exhausting and swimming while exhausted can be fatal so if you feel like you should take a break take a break, for real.  Once you've got your kicking down you can combine this with an underwater crawling motion with your hands and you basically have the doggie paddle. I imagine you're aiming for something a bit more effective so still standing shallow water bring your chest down to water level and bring one arm high over head like like you're throwing a ball in an overarm pitch. Hold your hand so your palm hits the water flat like you're trying to scoop the water behind you (you basically are). Alternate your arms so you look like a double windmill and practice this head up, then face in the water turning your face towards one side as that arm goes up. Practice this while standing still, stroke, breathe, stroke, breathe. Get this down pat. Now all that's left is to kick off the pool floor with your legs and combine kicking with the stroke berating thing and voila, you're swimming.  For more advanced techniques, consult an instructor."
DecidingToBeBetter,3c65ly,4dan,2,Sun Jul 5 06:13:06 2015 UTC,"Flip your feet like divers with flippers, keep your hands going in circles! Congratulations your keeping yourself afloat! The doggy paddle is only natural after that and if you'd like to advance into more swim strokes that's when you forward onto adult swim classes. Honestly, it you keep a relax and calm head, unfazed and not scared of the water where you wouldn't just simply thrash about, swimming will come naturally really quickly. Lower yourself in, start flipping your feet quickly, and paddle your arms in circles in front of you. You'll get your groove! Circles as in literal circles. Not up and down, just circles."

It's always fun to see the moment when your classmates figure out how to breathe properly, or overcome something that was really hard for them.  If you're totally new, you'll get more for your money if you teach yourself how to breathe in the tub, or a sink if your head fits!"
DecidingToBeBetter,3c65ly,Costco1L,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:41:17 2015 UTC,"Is there a YMCA in your area? They have adult swim classes. I taught swim lessons there as a side job for about ten years. The quality of instruction really varies from teacher to teacher. Try to watch a couple different instructors before picking the one for you.   Red Cross publishes a great, fully illustrated, swimming book that covers the basics to advanced swim form & great practice drills.   Get some goggles that fit you right (TYR is my fav) and get used to putting your face in the water and blowing bubbles out your nose to keep the water from going in. Figure out how slow you can bubble out before the water comes in. This is swim mastery step #1 and if you haven't got this down yet to being comfortable stop and keep working on it.   Get used to looking DOWN in the pool; not putting your face in and looking at the side of the pool. Look at the bottom. Looking at the bottom of the pool while you do the crawl or breaststroke will keep your spine in line and your butt on top of the water. If you look where you're going all the time (a quick glance is OK) your butt is going to sink in the water and you will be fighting the water instead of swimming in top of it. The kick in the crawl ( rigid knees, floppy ankles) is present primarily to keep your butt from sinking, not propulsion- that's what your arms are doing.   If you can't get an instructor cuz there are no adult classes nearby, get someone to stand on the side of the pool and video record you. Then watch them and compare to the form shown in the Red Cross book. The best swim coaches do this very thing- watch you, and make small corrections that once mastered build into great form.   Swimming is an art! I hope you are able to find some competent instruction! In my opinion the #1 difference between shit and great instructors is- are they getting in the pool with students? If they're only walking back and forth yelling things, fire them and find someone else. If they're int he pool, watching your above and below water stokes, demonstrating good form, doing drills with you and helping out- hire them."

THIS is why my 100 backstroke time was only a couple of seconds off my free. My coaches fucking sucked.

I've found it's really easy to spot a good swim coach: Do they ever get in the water and watch your stroke from underneath the water line? If YES: probably good.  If NO: get a different coach stat.

It is a ridiculously important life skill. Swimming is a tricky beast to master once you pass the age of seven or so.   Swimming is all about relaxing and letting muscle memory do the work. If you don't have someone trained watching and correcting you, you will develop bad techniques that you will find hard to break. As others have said, GET AN INSTRUCTOR. They know the what to look for that will become a massive problem later that you can't even see. Also don't drown.  PM me if you want any more info."

Really it's all about being calm. Stick to shallow water, work on floating on your back, and just try to get comfortable being in the water. Don't be ashamed to learn how to doggy paddle.

Just relax and learn to tread water and doggy paddle. Swimming is just pushing the water down and back to make yourself move up and foreword. After you can tread water and doggy paddle, you can learn to float on your stomach as the basis for freestyle. A course can't hurt but if you just like auto-didacticism, go for it."

It's very typical of me to have what I think are life changing epiphanies and then lose focus and not stick with them.  I have these epiphanies and think I got the biggest part down, but really it's the straight up work that comes after these that makes me a better person.  Sounds like it's at this point is where you're struggling.  I totally did too, and still do sometimes, but I found what helps is starting small.   Like really small.   When I first started getting myself going I made to-do lists that consisted of maybe three things like brush my teeth or make my bed.   Super small but crossing them off made me feel like I accomplished something, and I did, because eventually I started getting bigger and better shit done.  I guess when I'm losing focus I just go back to starting small.  Be realistic about what to get done, and maybe it's not a lot today, but even the smallest item you can cross off your mental list develops the inner strength that you actually have to earn.   Really, it's developing a healthy discipline , and that will in turn develop into inner strength, motivation, and determination."

I'm more likely to put the internet down and do a thing that will get me one step closer.  That's the other key: I checklist like my life depends on it. The process is huge? All right, I bet I can do ONE THING today.   For example, learning a language. I have to do my reading practice, every day.

He insisted it was all my fault because I sulked when it was clearly his fault for bringing up old stories from before I even met him. I blame him, I still haven't moved on or forgiven him for what he did to me. Neither have I forgiven myself for letting such an amazing guy go. We make sacrifices for love but it was getting to be too much for me. So remember, it's not your fault that he broke up with you. He just isn't the one meant to be to accept everything about you. I once read this somewhere. ""What are ex-boyfriends/girlfriends? They're just other people's soulmate that we accidentally crossed paths with."" Don't blame yourself. Don't you ever think that you're not good enough because you are. He just isn't the one. But just because things doesn't work out with him it it doesn't mean that it won't work out with anybody else. That guy is out there. He's also trying to reach you as fast as he can just like you are right now. I know how you feel. I really do. So I just want to tell you that it might take a while but you must forgive yourself for this whole thing. It is not your fault. Not at all. Remember that. You have lived without him before and you can do it again. Others love you, just because he stopped loving you it doesn't mean you don't have anyone else.

I would say that about 75% of my relationships have ended with me not being the pursuant of the termination. That has it's own level of suck - but so does being the initiator. In my case there were things i loved about the girl, several i still do. But something continued to feel like it was missing. I never asked her to change, because honestly some of the things were elements of the past and that is unchangeable. The other things were things that i felt as though it would be unfair for her to change them on my account. We spent the better part of a year making memories that i would never trade for anything and standing in the wake of it i can with absolute certainty say i have no regrets, and that every second i spent getting to know this wonderful girl was worth it.   In the end, the time getting to know each other was just that. it was an evaluation of whether we were completely in sync and whether or not (on both sides) we were with someone we could make a life with. That wasn't the case- a period of time passed that i spent in a sea of guilt. weeks of trying to figure out if it was my own hangups getting in the way, or if it just wasn't there. Turns out, it doesnt matter. It was keeping me from being as happy as whatever internal fairy tale i have dictates i should be.   You shouldn't change - just because something doesn't work out doesnt mean there is a problem you need to run out and address. Avoiding any ""fish in the sea"" cliche's; some of the fun in meeting new people is starting that process of personality mapping. Seeing how you two can live, laugh at, and most importantly- love each other's quirks is one of the most rewarding pieces to a relationship and we all deserve happiness."

You might feel like absolute garbage, but if on the outside you look like you have confidence, people will want to be around you. If you don't talk to anyone and don't put yourself out there, people are just gonna think you are not interested. You gotta initiate the conversation and honestly, act like its a privilege for them to talk to you, as douchey as that sounds. If you have chronic depression, you should definitely talk to a doctor about it and see what they think, maybe they can do something to help you. I sometimes have the same problems as you and they key things I have to remember are that I am someone people want to be around, I deserve to be happy, and there is nothing wrong with me! You might think you are a freak and something is wrong with you, but trust me, majority of people are socially awkward and depressed. So wherever you go, tell yourself that you are the best damn thing to walk on earth and everyone wants to be your friend...Now obviously this is an exaggeration, but its a huge confidence boost that you need! People will care about what you have to say if you portray yourself as someone important and worth listening to. I know the advice I gave sounds like something an asshole would do, but the world will not give a shit about you if your a wall flower.

People I meet don't view me as the meek kid in school, they have a completely blank slate and I can show them who I really am. Try asking a classmate who you talk to, to hang out outside of school.

DecidingToBeBetter,3c38dj,justTheTip12,2,Sat Jul 4 14:10:18 2015 UTC,"If you're practicing concepts you don't understand maybe it is a good idea to step back a lesson until you are at a lesson that is understandable for you. Don't try to learn 2 difficult concepts at a time, make sure you're stepping back far enough so that you're dealing with 1 concept at a time.   Imagine the student did not have a good grasp of complex numbers and they encounter complex eigenvalues, they won't have a good time. The fundamentals are important, might be worth it to step back until you fill in some missing gaps before tackling the harder problems.  A brief discussion with your professor will probably help you reveal the gaps that you need to fill to do well in the course."

DecidingToBeBetter,3c0x3t,largemargin-,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:33:50 2015 UTC,"Meditations:       Meditations (Medieval Greek: Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν Ta eis heauton, literally ""[that which is] to himself"") is a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 CE, recording his private notes to himself and ideas on Stoic philosophy.  Marcus Aurelius wrote the 12 books of the Meditations in Koine Greek  as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement.  It is possible that large portions of the work were written at Sirmium, where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170 to 180. Some of it was written while he was positioned at Aquincum on campaign in Pannonia, because internal notes tell us that the first book was written when he was campaigning against the Quadi on the river Granova (modern-day Hron) and the second book was written at Carnuntum.  It is unlikely that Marcus Aurelius ever intended the writings to be published and the work has no official title, so ""Meditations"" is one of several titles commonly assigned to the collection. These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs.

DecidingToBeBetter,3c2tbv,underneathstars,2,Sat Jul 4 05:54:29 2015 UTC,"Personally for me, I've changed two things this year that are having a very positive impact on my life. The rest will no doubt follow as I start to feel better and better about myself.   Firstly, I've deleted facebook and deactivated my account. The main reason for this is I found I rarely posted anything. I just wasted time looking at other people's finely crafted portrayals of their ""perfect"" lives. Which I now realise was making me feel inadequate on a subconscious level. I mean, come on, if your life is so amazing why are you spending the majority of it meticulously documenting everything and posting it all to facebook? People who tend to brag are usually trying ro make up for their own inadequacies. I now focus on my own life and those important to me much more.  Secondly (and this is a big one for me), I've joined the gym and have actually begun to enjoy it. I'm about 6 weeks in and already starting to notice a difference. Im going about 3-4 times a week usually for an hour after work. This is helping to boost my confidence and giving me an overall good feeling. I'm happier, have more energy, and don't feel so guilty about food anymore. I've even starting to take notice of what I eat a bit more as I now know how much effort it takes to burn calories (I am not dieting in any way though but am still gradually losing weight).  Just those two things have really made a difference to my life. I've probably spent the last 10-15 years not looking after myself too much, so I know all about lacking motivation. But now I seem to have it in spades!  I still smoke pot more often than I probably should and drink a little bit more than is healthy, but those thing will change too eventually. I find that one step at a time works best for me.  Perhaps don't try to put too many demends on yourself and just try one or two things. The rest can follow in time."
DecidingToBeBetter,3c2tbv,InfiniteTypewriters,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:23:42 2015 UTC,"You might start by reading Better than Before by Gretchen Rubin. You could listen to the audio book while you're doing your fitbit! And then move on to other audiobooks. Bewm.  There's 2 off your list right there. Since your mind will be occupied with the book, you won't be as aware of your anxiety about leaving the house.   The book is all about habits, and how forming a habit makes us rely less on self control (habits are powerful).   In your case, I would say start with the shoulder exercises and going to work to pay off debt. Those seem the most crucial to your health and well-being.   If you can only manage to successfully do these 2 things for a few weeks, you're off to a great start. Having a small success will make you more enthused about tackling a little more.   Buy your favorite snack foods on sale at a store and take them to work with you. You can usually get cans of diet coke for something like 28 cents, vs the 75-1.50 you are charged at vending machines.   How long are you trying to meditate for? 5 minutes daily would be a great start. Right now it sounds like your mornings are kind of packed with trying to do a lot of self improvement. Could you do it on a lunch break? Or in your car before/after work? Be creative about sneaking in a time!   But yes, you do need better morning and evening routines. The way to change your habits is to change them. Sounds easy, but it takes persistence. The book I recommended helped me so much.   You could try setting a timer for your Facebook/reddit time in the evenings. 30 minutes, then get up for 5 minutes and do your face care, meditation, shoulder exercises, read some pages of a book, whatever. Then you can be online for 30 minutes more before getting up again to do something else. The point is to get you used to NOT just sitting there for hours with no awareness of the passing time. And then each 30 minute segment feels like a reward for your successful bout of adulting/getting better. :)  If you mean you smoke cigarettes, I would say take care of these other ones first until you get a taste of success and have some confidence that you can do what is good for your health. If you meant pot, try to find ways to smoke LESS, for now. Any step in a good direction is a good step."
DecidingToBeBetter,3c2tbv,Ihavesiftedthistles,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"Your situation reminds me very much of my own.  I have been trying to build daily habits for just over a year now, and I've had periods where I was very successful and got many of my habits done, but every time I will eventually slip back to doing the minimum to get by.  It's odd because what really helps is just doing a few habits each day, sets me up to be motivated during the day and get things done that I've been putting off, and I just feel better.  But for some reason, for me, it's just hard to stick to it every day even with the huge benefits that I see when I do my daily habits.  I do have some advice that I think may help though.  I've found grouping together a few habits into a morning routine works wonders.  I see 4 habits that you listed that could be grouped (shoulder exercises, skin care, Meditation, and Walking); all great habits to do in the morning and depending on how much time you are planning to invest on each one, it looks like about 45 minutes of work, which isn't hard to fit into the morning.  So since you said that you feel overwhelmed you could try just getting those down.  Maybe get a calendar to keep track of successful days.  Also if you or anyone else would like to talk routinely about habits and how they are going feel free to PM me, like I said I've been trying for a very long time with mixed results, I've learned a lot from my experiences but that still hasn't helped me to stick to it every day.  So I am kinda at the point now where I think it would be helpful to have people to talk to about progress."

It's scary to have your first realization that you're not special in the way that your momma always told you.  You're not good at everything. You're good at a few things and less good at just about everything else. And your potential is to be great at a few things and still less good at everything else. Skill is not innate, it takes practice to be good at things. Not 10 000 hours of practice, but practice nonetheless.  You have a close partner in your life who tells you that you're amazing. You're great in her eyes. But in your own, you're ""a dick"", you're ""very lazy"". The best part? You can fix these things, and the most difficult part of the whole process is simply realizing that they're a problem. You're quite aware that you're lazy, that you could be doing better in school. So if you have any faith in yourself, and if you care at all about her, you'll try to fix that, as much as you can.  I assume this is the first time you're really becoming aware of your own faults. This is GOOD. I can't stress that enough. No one's perfect, but with awareness, you can keep bettering yourself."

DecidingToBeBetter,3c1n4l,HoardingStrings,2,Sat Jul 4 03:16:05 2015 UTC,"Awareness of a problem is the first step in the solution, so hats off to you for recognizing what you do lot like and what you seek to change.  Here is what I would do...   First, write down all of the qualities of someone, real or imaginary, that you look up the most. Dissect those qualities and think about how one would obtain that characteristic starting from scratch.   Second, you are being very hard on yourself. Practice self compassion, not self esteem, but self compassion. Self compassion differs at it does not depend on temporary qualities. You feel happy because you look good today, or you scored high on a test. Self esteem also promotes those comparisons, I feel good because I am smarter than him or her. Self compassion is extending love inwards to yourself as you would any other person you love.   Lastly, volunteer give back. Sometimes it takes something eye opening to see how good your life is to truly appreciate it. I have spent several years volunteering with adults and youth with disabilities giving music lessons or just helping learn life skills. This has made me feel good about myself and I can do this by helping others? Yes that works.   Best of luck to you sir. Do your best you will never be perfect but you can always treat those you love with compassion and kindness."

Work on your own issues, build yourself up, learn to develop a good 'frame' ( or objective perspective), perhaps something confrontational like boxing, other martial arts, or joining a debate society would assist with this goal, coupled with meditation or running. Identify your triggers, is there any pattern which led to you snap. Reflect on it, and work on becoming desensitised / in control of it, even if it is just going for a walk. Avoid abusive relationships in the future. Take responsibility for your violence in this relationship, and assure her that she should never be with a violent person (first point) or in an abusive relationship. Then remember that you do not deserve to be in an abusive relationship too; it is too late with this particular relationship but in the future set strong boundaries early and be prepared to walk away early. You're too young for this crap, and relationships should not be burdensome.   In this relationship, your violent reactions may fade with maturity, or worsen in time. However, what is  evident is that you are not ready yet. Even though it may be difficult and very upsetting be assured that you are doing your girlfriend a huge favour in ending the relationship, and you are pretty much rehauling your life - doing yourself untold favours; you will develop some rock solid life skills which will make you a far more confident and better person - 'future you will high-five and buy 'present you' a drink."

It's not about the relationship it's about you. If you react violently when she hits your soft spots you probably do the same when you are drunk or otherwise emotionally compromised. You need to accept that you think violence is a solution to emotional distress and work through that directly. No amount of relationship pandering or avoidance/withdraw therapy will help until you accept that you act like a child and it is wrong as an adult and go seek therapy for it.

It isn't something you will be able to get away from. I don't think you'll ever be able to recover from it emotionally.   I'm not sure if you drink, or if this happens when you're drinking, but I understand the feeling of something else being in control. The other thing that is in control is a deeper part of the brain. If this happens when you're drinking, you have less control over that part of your brain. If it IS when you're drinking, then you should seriously consider taking a look at that as well."

While I have never struck her I have on many occasions completely lost self control and been violent, threatening her, calling her every despicable name under the sun and at times, seriously, profoundly feeling like I could punch her in the face.   I have on occasion needed to beg for forgiveness and will carry the guilt of the wrongs I have done her with me forever. Thankfully 99.9% of our relationship has been wonderful and one of mutual love and respect but I am always mindful of the times when I have been cruel and threatening. All I can ever do to make up for it is to be as kind and affectionate to her as I possibly can be and whenever the opportunity presents itself to be selfless and good to her.  You have only been together a short time but vicious arguments can and will happen sometimes, its natural and something that is swept under the carpet I think. Obviously we don't know if your relationship will be a 'forever' relationship like mine, but the same rules apply. Forgive yourself if you can and make sure you never fucking do this shit again. Walk away when you feel your heart pounding with fury, leave the situation and come back later and talk. If you love each other, you can get through these dark moments."

DecidingToBeBetter,3c0exv,cbcoolio,7,Fri Jul 3 17:06:57 2015 UTC,"I think work ethic is a combination of habit, mental exercise, and perspective/values.   You have to break some bad habits and build good ones. Trying to break and build all your habits at once is nearly impossible, so focus on breaking one bad habit that keeps you from getting work done at a time. It takes about a month, so aim for breaking/forming one new habit per month.   Focus is a sort of mental strength and can be exercised and conditioned similar to any muscle group. Use a timer to build your focus in longer and longer increments. Experiment to figure out what helps and hurts your focus: different environments, noise levels, positions, etc. And just as with muscle building, pay attention to what you eat and how you rest.   And finally, give yourself some long term perspective. Write down and read long term goals. Identify and imagine the life you can build with a better work ethic. Give yourself something to reach for that's a bit beyond what you think you could realistically achieve, and take note when you get a step closer."

Discipline in my diet is sticking to a list of foods/meals. Willpower is thinking ""I shouldn't have those doughnuts, ooh but I really want them, because they are here and free and I have to test my willpower to not have them."" Discipline is ""I am not eating those doughnuts because they are not part of my diet.""  Willpower - you think you have a choice Discipline - just do the thing you decided you want to do.

That's my view at least.  I'd also recommend listening to your heart and body... the problem is when most people do that they don't hear shit because they're disconnected and out out touch with themselves.

Most successful people don't have just one goal, they are constantly in pursuit of many objectives.  If the path to one goal is stalled, they move on to different goal for a while and chip away at that.   They're also flexible in that they can reassess their goals, nothing is set in stone.  Think of a goal as more like a direction.  If you want a million dollars, you move your bank account in the direction of a million dollars.  If you get to a half million and decide that's good enough, then the original goal was still valid, because it moved you in the right direction.  Sounds like that mindset could benefit you.  If you like a myriad of things, it is very easy to get distracted and lose focus.  Set goals for your passions and move towards them in a focused way.  Sure, things will change and all that, but at least you're moving in a positive direction."

DecidingToBeBetter,3by10k,chrunchy,3,Fri Jul 3 06:49:16 2015 UTC,"I find it funny that people have a hard time deciding what they want to do. I've known what I wanted to do since I was 9, and the theme has changed somewhat, but the general idea is still there. Although, despite this, there have been times where I have questioned whether what I think I want to do is really what I want to do, but the answer always turns out to be ""yes"".  One of these times was about half a year after I left university when I was working a horribly shitty job as a shitty wine salesman in a horribly large and garish shopping centre. My sense of morale was being crushed day by day, and the idea of having to do this job to get by as I pursued my true passion was atrocious. But, through some experimentation, I realised that all I wanted to do was ""what I wanted to do"". While I sold the wine, I had to perform my own pitch to sell as well as I could. I'm really not a salesperson, it really does not suit my personality, and being one for a while only gave me a bad attitude towards salespeople. That they are dishonest, and will say anything that will get them a sale. I don't know if this is true, but my manager told me to say dishonest things, which, largely, I didnt, but when she was around, I felt forced to lie. This always made me feel sick. So to get by all the shitty salesperson feeling, I tried to make my pitch as entertaining as possible. I tried to make the potential customer laugh. This was done by inserting and perfecting some well timed jokes into my pitch, as well as some conversational improvisation, which I can only do after a lot of coffee.  I found that all the feeling of being a dishonest person selling a shitty, overpriced, under volumed, gimmicky wine evaporated somewhat when I made the customer laugh. At the end of the shift, I would look back throughout the day and wade through all the bullshit and scumbaggery, and find shining beacons of happiness where I made somebody laugh. Yes, I sold them a shitty product that they are most likely going to regret buying once they get home, but at least I made them laugh a few times.  It was then that I realised that even in my shittiest moments, even when I felt like I was wasting my time with a shit-on-my-soul job, I could still enjoy what I loved best - making people laugh. Evidently, I also enjoy speaking and performing in general, and I get a real kick out of creating things. One of my biggest passions is watching film - specifically films with some sort of sense of humour. All of these things were rediscovered over constant self-reflection, I just tried to get to know myself as much as possible.  So, wrapping it in altogether, I'm on my way to become a film-maker - specifically films with some sort of sense of humour. I also wish to dabble in stand up comedy, though, I don't think I'm quite funny enough to hold a stage like that - so I might just stick to film.  So, what I'm trying to say, in a very roundabout way, is that although you don't think there is a clear path for you, if you set off in a direction, any at all, a path will open up for you. I thought there was nothing to gain from my shitty job, but it turned out only to reinforce my aspirations.  My advice to you is to keep going, to self-reflect as much as possible - take notes if you have to - and realise what brings you the most joy. When you find out what brings out the best in you, you'll know it's what you want to pursue.

Recently I've been getting to know myself better and here are some rambling tips I hope can give you some ideas:   Just dive in and try anything that's ever so mildly interesting to you (responsibly, of course). When I don't know what I want, I work it out in reverse by trying things out and figuring out what I definitely don't want, and narrow down from there. You'll need to be honest with yourself when you discover that you don't enjoy doing what you're doing.  Recall any memories from your toddler age, as far back as you can, and notice the little things that you have done from the age of 2 or 3 or whenever you start to have memory. By little things I do mean every tiny details. When I was 3 before I even learned how to write, I'd already picked up a pen and started scribbling wiggly lines that resemble calligraphic handwriting vaguely. Now I realised I really do like calligraphy. I also grew up with a lot of dinosaur encyclopedias at pre-school ages and now I like dinosaurs. Remember to exclude how useful these things really are in the real world, just focus on discovering things that still give you tingles in your mind now. Talk about what you've done or tried, either with a friend or with anyone you feel comfortable with. As you speak you'll also discover things about yourself that you did not realised prior to the conversation.    I might add more as they come to mind, but good luck!"

After all, you'll have changed after you accomplish your first 'goal.' You could be an entirely different person in a year. And another in five. Maybe you'll have more things to add to your list, or have decided to get rid of a few more. Meditate a bit, don't worry about the future. Just do. Enjoy the journey. It's not easy, but it's possible. Live in the now.  You can't actually see these paths closing and opening. Have you ever been able to predict the future?

Here are some step-by-step stuff for you to do that is going to build upon each other.    Everyone is lazy, that's called human nature. Stop calling yourself that, along with all other negative adjectives. The words you use to describe yourself and your situation become your reality, because you made it that way in your mind first. Watch your language, and it would be kind of cool to see you rewrite this entire paragraph in a positive way. Good exercise.  You gotta figure out what the hell you want to do everyday. That's all you get buddy, one day at a freaking time. In order to find this out  though, you need set some coordinates with a vision, get some goals, and start finding out what daily things you have to do. This is how you build a SKILL. When you have a skill, you never have to worry too much about employment or lack of confidence. CNQR.co has an entire four-part free campaign on that called Kaizen.  Start learning about how to properly take care of, improve, and modify your body. The point of fitness is not to look good, it's to be good. Eat good foods for fuel and use your bodyweight to get insanely strong. All this month is fitness month, so keep in touch for all the routines and food plans and stuff, or just google your heart out.  You have to find your daily rules. Make rules, not habits. Be the kind of person who says to others and yourself, ""No, I don't _____ (smoke, eat that, punch babies)"" instead of ""No thank you, or not now.""    There are five things you can do every day at various levels of intensity that are going to help you grow with every single thing you said. You'll find this list in Kaizen (that means daily improvement in Japanese, by the way).   Do something that improves your physical health. Do something that improves your mental health. Create something you are proud of. Help someone in need. Sometimes, all that takes is a smile. Find the time to appreciate and enjoy your world.   Check in with me in a few months, would you? Finally, don't stress to much my friend. This life is a giant game. Play the cards you've got, learn the winning strategies, and don't forget to have fun going through it."

You might not see it, but some of them will be racking up credit card debt, others are making bad relationship decisions, others are hiding some kind of personal problem, and most of them probably feel like they have no idea what's going on. Those of them who feel like they know what's going on are probably wrong.  The older you get, the more you'll learn about the world, and the smaller you'll feel. You'll realize that there are all kinds of things that you don't know, you'll never know, and you'll never even know that you don't know. If you feel like you know everything, then you know nearly nothing.  To build confidence, build your body by working out. The goal is not to become physically intimidating, but to prove to yourself that you are in control of your own body and mind, and that your body and mind are prepared for life.   Get a job that requires public speaking of  some kind. I was much like you when I was in High School. I hated speaking to groups, and I kept my mouth shut most of the time. After working at a job at a movie theater where I had to talk to thousands of people a day, it became boring. I had to yell movie start times to hundreds of people waiting in the lobby. It started to be fun. I still don't really like talking to people, but talking to groups is much easier now.  As for hard work, it's not that big of a deal. Find a job that doesn't require hard work. Work security or something along those lines. If you one day find something that you're excited about doing, or if you decide that you'd really like to work harder and get paid more, then you'll be able to do that."

I learned quickly that if I tried hard and actually cared, not only did others really appreciate and respect me, but I felt good and I liked myself. That is what you need. No one knows everything about how to be a grown-up in their early 20's. It's totally normal to be lost. Learning how to work hard and be accountable transformed me completely, and after a few years I was actually thinking about how open my future was and what I really wanted to do. For me that meant going back to school, but it can mean whatever you want.   As for being lazy, it is a decision and a state of mind. You have to change the way you think about effort. Just because something takes effort does not mean it is bad. Hard work is not bad. Every time your mind makes this assumption, correct it, and push through. You can change the negative association with effort that drives laziness.   Also, be kind to yourself. You deserve compassion, you are flawed and human just like the rest of us. You just want to be happy and loved like the rest of us. Don't beat yourself up - just push yourself towards whatever will make you happy."

DecidingToBeBetter,3bxbty,BreakMyLimits,3,Thu Jul 2 22:42:43 2015 UTC,"As time passes and I get older I realize I am a conglomeration of many people I have met.  I take the best parts from people I respect and integrate them into my personality.  At least that is what it seems like.  So, when I consider being authentic I wonder what that is exactly.  Who is the authentic me?  I guess it comes down to filtering.  What I mean is, do I filter what I say or how I act?  If so, I feel like I am not being authentic.  Anyway, to your question:  Yes, even in middle age I wonder if being my authentic self will put some people off.  The people I pursue relationships with are those who I feel completely comfortable being authentic.  Those people don't judge me for being me.  As I get older I realize that people who make you feel bad for being you are just simply people you should not waste time on.  I used to get upset and try to get them to like me.  But no more.  No need to waste the time and effort when there are people out there who will like/love you for who you are.  Find those people and enjoy life."
DecidingToBeBetter,3bxbty,AWickedWookiee4u,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:05:43 2015 UTC,"do I filter what I say or how I act? If so, I feel like I am not being authentic.   I used to say terrible shit to people. If it hadn't been for the plan to do better and filter my mind, I'd still bog myself and others in the infinite narcissistic craving for attention that has been instilled in me. That being said, I understand what you mean: your words are about bending for others so that they'd like you more. It is, indeed, not the way of life that you want to choose.  Being authentic is being what you want to be.  Do you want to be honest? Talk about things the way you see them: call a toxic relationship, a badly-made shirt or your discomfort for what those are.  Do you want to respected? Be strong, have strong boundries, do the right thing (whatever that is for you) and don't bend to envy and stupidity just so others will like you. Be Hated.  Do you want to be able to run for an hour without problems? Start with running for a minute, and raise the time for each run until you're up for the challenge. Then take the challenge, repeat if you fail, succeed.  It doesn't matter if you come from the surrounding of lying people, that you weren't respected in school or that you're very much used to sit in one place all day for as long as you remember your adult self. If, imagining yourself on the deathbed, you realize that this is what you would've liked to achieve, this is what you have to strive for. The deathbed fantasy, it seems, is the best measure for whether you're doing authentic.   people who make you feel bad for being you are just simply people you should not waste time on   Let me put it this way, for it is more explanatory: if any person doesn't like you being yourself, it is a person with whom you have little to nothing in common already. Chasing this person's affection is like looking for food you don't like: why would you want to cause yourself fruitless suffering? It is, as you rightly say, better to look for and stay with people who aren't intimidated or put off by your authentic self, for those are the ones who will accept you, and acceptance is what we crave."

DecidingToBeBetter,3bqyza,LEMOPUGE,2,Wed Jul 1 13:07:20 2015 UTC,"You don't have to be strong for anyone but yourself. You are you, and your older sister is someone else, you will continue to be you. There is no good sister / bad sister. Everyone is individual, you do things in your own unique way, it's like comparing apples and oranges, really. Just do what feels right to you and everything will fall into place. Life is basically a learning process.  I actually didn't care if my little sister looked up to me or not, I guess my attitude about that was similar to wanting to be popular. I didn't care about impressing people.   When we were older she told me how much she looked up to me when she was a kid, I had no idea. It didn't matter what I did, actually. Sometimes I was a shit and sometimes she was a shit. That's growing up, I guess. Everyone is a bit of a shit when they're kids. You're learning.  She didn't necessarily come to me for stuff, she was pretty self sufficient and hard headed, so I let her do her thing. I was still there for talking if she needed to. We were close when we were younger, but the relationship switched to an adult one. You all grow up at some point and priorities shift.   I'm ""bisexual"" as well. It's been a journey to figure that out. I put it in quotes because it doesn't quite fit me, it's just a term that people seem to understand on some level. For one thing, I don't believe in a binary. I think gender and orientation exist more on a spectrum. Don't like the term ""pansexual"" either though, and don't want to have to explain to each person I meet what it means and hear them make stupid jokes about it. I'm not exactly sure if the definition fits me well either.  I had some idea I wasn't straight by the time I was eleven or so, but back then was different than now. For one thing the mentality was that you were either straight or gay, being bisexual meant you were gay and holding onto the closet. So I was pretty confused. I didn't fit either category.   I came out for a brief period as lesbian in my 20s and I didn't like the butch-femme construct either, and straight people pissed me off when they would ask mockingly, ""so if you're lesbians which one of you is the man?"" Guess what, neither of us. My girlfriend of the time would reply derisively that ""we don't role play"". I felt bad later because I found out some people of the older generation did follow a butch femme construct and felt marginalized by my generation, many of whom sneered at gender roles. They were a construct of the patriarchy trying to keep us down.   I think though, that everyone goes through this journey of figuring out who they are. And reaching adulthood doesn't mean that it ends. People grow and change throughout their lives. I had no idea even into my 20s and 30s that if I fell in love with a woman that I would have the option of marrying her and having a family like I could with a man. I always thought it would be a life of compromise. This is a radical time. It will change with each generation. When I hit my 60's and 70's there will be another change. I wonder what that will be like.   I think though, that attitude is what gets you through it. So hopefully I will be like this woman: http://www.irunfar.com/2015/06/gunhild-swanson-post-2015-western-states-100-interview.html I don't need to run marathons, but I would like to not be stopped from living my life because of society's conceptions. She's run over 260 marathons, with some ultramarathons mixed in. She's before my generation, in the 80s women were banned from marathons. We were too frail, it was for our own good. She actually wasn't admitted into a race when she was in her 60s, because they didn't believe she could do it, and she had them reconsider. She set a record at 60 for a race. At 71 she ran a hundred mile ultramarathon and set a record as the first woman in her age group to complete it. Screw those people. Believe in yourself.  Back in high school I could never have imagined how the world could change. Some ways it's better, some ways not so great. But there are always magical things you never thought would happen.  Just keep in mind, what is now will not always be."

It takes a lot of people a long time to learn how to do that. You're young and have plenty of time to discover yourself and make the change you wanna see. Take your time and enjoy that process while you can because it doesn't get any easier as you get older.   I'm 22 and still young myself, and only started figuring out what you are now four years ago, and I'm STILL sorting through everything. If it helps, know that you're not alone and not the only one going through what you are. Seize the moment and wothout being necessarily selfish do what YOU think is good for YOU. Know that there is no ""right way"" to live your life, and that all you can do is live it or get left behind.   Again, you're young and this process won't happen over night. You have to constantly be working on it, forming good habits and breaking bad ones. If you fuck up do the only thing you can do. Get up, move forward, and learn from your mistakes.

Yours seems to take a bit of both, which sucks. I struggled with it for a long time, until I realised quitting wasn't easy at all, but it was simple. You just have to convince yourself, truly, that you want to quit. Then you stick with it and trust your initial judgment, realising that any change in your thinking is just a ""thirst"" for that addictive habit. So basically you have to be 100% sure you want to quit, go cold turkey and then never look back.

Think of a hobby or activity that you would've always liked to do and go bloody do it!   Exercising is the easiest example. I can guarantee that you'll feel more awake and energetic once you start, and you'll also get fit which is a bonus.   As for the actual cutting out, that's really up to the person. Some people just can't handle going cold turkey and find it easier gradually cutting out. I'd personally recommend the cold turkey approach, I had to do it with coffee (and look at my username!). I just think it's best totally removing the bad thing from your life and doing your best to forget about it.   You could also think of something that you want to buy or do, and put the money that you would normally spend on weed in a jar or whatever is easiest for you. You could even set up a standing order for a different bank account every month. This way, you'll get to reward yourself for what you've given up and it will make it feel worth while.

I'd recommend starting by cutting back to see if any of your habits change for the better, rather than cutting it out entirely, especially if you suffer from chronic pain and insomnia. Start by buying an ounce or two, or whatever you deem the minimum to make it through the month and immediately divide it into four separate containers, one for each week of the month. Once your weekly allotment is gone, do not move onto the next until you reach the next week, this will help to teach rationing and self control.   Second, if your main reason for smoking began with medicating for insomnia and chronic pain, try to limit yourself to only smoking once or twice in the evening, before you plan to go to bed."

DecidingToBeBetter,3bs4pm,OklaJosha,3,Thu Jul 2 21:27:18 2015 UTC,"My only recommendation is to find something else to do. I don't mean another drug. I mean find something to occupy your time. For example I know someone who was an alcoholic(different but same idea) who bought a 1968 Camaro. He lost his license for 20 years(due to multiple DUIs in under a month) so spent all his spare time fixing up the car. It was mint condition(except it was not numbers matching because he replaced motor but still) when he was done and was years since he had a drink.   It doesn't really matter what you do. You can fix up a car. You can start working out like a lot of people are suggesting. You can start learning how to program computers or how electronics work. You can learn to take care of your house and do home improvement projects. You can take up something like RC Cars/RC planes/Drones. You can become a HAM radio operator. Hell every time you wanna smoke fuck your wife.  What ever you do go all in on it. Take the money you would spend on a month of weed and buy whatever you need to partake in the hobby. After initial investment most hobbies are much cheaper. Learn as much as you can about whatever you want to do. Every time you want to smoke...DO THE HOBBY.   For example if you want to work out: Want to smoke? Do 20 pushups.  Want to smoke again? Do 40 Situps.  Want to smoke more? Go run a mile.  Want to smoke again? Bench press 10 sets of 5 reps of 100 pounds.  These are all randomly made up numbers but you get the idea. When ever you want to smoke instead of smoking do something else.  For the first few weeks/months don't worry about what time it is. You want to smoke at 2AM? Go curl some free weights till you cant even lift the bowl :-D  Your biggest problem(based on other people I know who quit) is gonna be ""I have nothing to do, I can go smoke a bowl and then watch tv/play video games/veg out/take a nap and no one will know . Its only one time, I wont make it a habit again""...BULLSHIT!  You will make it a habit again. Do not say ""I can get away with it just this once"". Tell your wife to hold you accountable. Tell her if she ever catches you high do X/Don't do X.   Think every time you smoke you are hurting your sons future. Which do you want to have happen; You get high for an hour or your son actually goes to college and gets a good job? What if every time you got high your son comes up to you and with a straight face says ""I am disappointed in you daddy"". No anger just that he thought you were better then being unable to not smoke. Hell take his picture and write that caption below it and put it on top of your stash. That way every time you go to smoke you have to look at him and see him disappointed in you.   If seeing your son's face telling you he is disappointed in you every time you light up doesn't stop you then I don't know what to tell you; Me personally I would not be able to light up with out bawling my eyes out at what a disappointment I was to my family and that would make me never want to smoke again."

DecidingToBeBetter,3bs4pm,arbivark,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:40:54 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to point out that getting the pot out of your life will likely make you less likely to screw up your dietary goals. I know the ""munchies"" get less prominent over time, but there's still an affect after years of use.  I quit after using for a year and a bit, because it was making me very anxious and exacerbating some of my mental health problems. So it was pretty easy, when I was able to look objectively at my experience and know that it wasn't really adding anything to my life.  My partner is currently cutting down on his consumption, and is at the point where he's trying to consume about half a gram a day. I would suggest a gradual approach in getting off the stuff, but some people just do cold turkey better.   What I think might be helpful is to focus on what will improve as a result of you quitting. Also, when removing bad habits it's important to replace them with good ones - you don't want to cut all pleasure out of your life. You say you take it to feel relaxed - what else relaxes you? Can you go out on the porch with a cold drink when the urge strikes you, or meditate or something?   Good luck to you"

It stops the anger and hate from eating you up inside.  Forgiveness isn't a gift you give to others but a give you give yourself.
DecidingToBeBetter,3bt0sv,instantanarchy,5,Wed Jul 1 22:21:11 2015 UTC,"Small Victories are the BEST victories because they give your MOMENTUM.   Especially with something like weight loss making a series of small adjustments to your life style will eventually lead a LARGE shift in not only your lifestyle but your IDENTITY.  You need a reason for wanting to lose weight for YOURSELF. Screw what everyone else says. If you're doing things for other people's reasons it's not SUSTAINABLE. You need to come up with compelling reasons why this is important to you.  The trick is to get REALLY specific..Not just ""Oh I want to be healthy"" but maybe it's ""I'm really sick of not being able to make it up the stairs anymore"" or ""I can't even play with my daughter anymore"" or ""I've had it with feeling unsexy when I look in the mirror""...Find the REAL pains behind the weight you want to lose.  Also since I've done this myself..(Changed my eating and exercise habits) Look into different diets and exercise routines and just TRY them. If one doesn't work TRY ANOTHER. Finding what works for you is all about self experimentation.   If it doesn't work DO NOT BEAT YOURSELF UP. CHANGE STRATEGIES..It's most likely your process that needs refining. If you are making the EFFORT you are NOT a FAILURE. You're brave and beautiful for taking the first steps forward."

From reading your post it sounds like you would benefit from heading over to /r/loseit There are many motivating people there that are all on the same journey.  If you aren't happy with your current weight than you are not perfect the way you are. Also losing weight is obviously not the easiest thing in the world. You don't need to just suck it up and do it. You have to decide that its going to happen, and that nothing will stop you. It will not be an easy road but reddit is full of other people who are on the same journey. You can find that encouragement you are seeking here.    If you decide that its what you want anyone can do it. Which means you can do it.   also /r/C25k is another great motivational resource if you decide to try to become more active."
DecidingToBeBetter,3bt0sv,DeadLeprechaun2205,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:21:56 2015 UTC,"You know what? Screw everyone else. If you want to lose weight then don't care about what others think because if you continue to look at your image in the eyes of others then you are going to end up conflicted. You have to ask yourself a few questions and reaffirm them into your goals.   Why do you want to lose weight? What weight do you want to get to? What is distracting you?   If the answer to the first question is something like ""I want to look good for other people"" then change it to ""I want to look good for me"". You'll always meet people who will say you are too small or too big but when it comes down to the wire, you are the only person who matters on this subject.   Question two is quite simple; do you want to lose five pounds, a stone? Do you want to go down a jeans size? Find your goal and stick to it, don't change it half way through but if you have a clear goal in mind, your confidence will increase because you set a goal and you achieved it, there is nothing you cannot do if you set your mind to it.  Question three is a big one, what has kept you from doing this so far? If it has been the opinions of other people then forget them, they are not in charge of your body, you are. If diets are too hard, find one that works for you. If you are self-concious about going to the gym, find some workouts you can do at home.   The road may be long and hard but remember that if you fall on your face, you are still moving forward."

DecidingToBeBetter,3bmnc8,apollo_712,32,Tue Jun 30 13:22:09 2015 UTC,"I totally get the feels of this post.  I still struggle with some of the more addictive parts of my personality, but I've found that the biggest thing that really helped me want to improve was learning that I wasn't going to wake up one day and suddenly be ""the guy"" who does all the Totally Correct Healthy Things Good People Do. I was going to have to want to be that guy and move, piece by piece, in that direction.  The biggest helper on this road so far has been therapy.  It took me literally years of on-again-off-again therapy to find the right therapist who got me to stick with it.  I'm lucky in that regard: my university has free counciling and, external to that, my parents have amazing insurance that makes very good therapy functionally free.  If you aren't so lucky (say, you aren't on your parents' insurance), look around and be sure to talk to therapists in your area! Many of them have sliding scale-based payment plans that can work for you if you're low-income.  Therapy was important for me becuase it gave me perspective.  It is slowly teaching me that the problem/solution framework I use when I encounter issues is mal-adaptive.  Running for the booze (or, for me, weed) when confronted with a situation that makes me anxious only creates conditions that make future anxiety, depression, etc inevitable.  While staying up late tonight might feel good now, I'll regret it tomorrow morning and it will make me reliant on caffiene the next day (which is bad for my anxiety).  Et cetera.  It's about recognizing that the negative things that structure our lives (say, what you've described as your addictive personality) aren't an immutable part of who we are, they're just coping mechanisms that we use to address problems we don't wish to name.  It's good that you can recognize that those particular activities you participate in are detrimental to your well-being, that's a key first step that not very many people can take! You should feel better just knowing that you've made your first step without even realizing it.  Now use that momentum and build yourself up!  You deserve to be better, and one key mindset change I've learned to make in that regard is that, if I want to get rid of bad habits, I have to stop thinking of myself as the ""type"" of person who does them.  I know this kind of contradicts what I said at the very beginning, but follow my line of thought through.  There's a big difference, at least to me, when I encounter something that I want to do but shouldn't, and think ""I can't/shouldn't do that"" vs. ""I don't do that"" or ""I'm not the type of person who does that"".  And failing once - say, fapping when you're trying to be the person who doesn't watch porn - doesn't make that statement untrue. Your commitment isn't a house of cards, it's aspirational. No one is holding your attempt to be better up to the level of perfection. Failures and successes are how we learn the strengths and limitations of our motivation.  For example, no matter how much I wanted to be the kind of guy who exercises every morning, I had to realize that my body just can't do the sleep schedule required to get in an hour of exercise before 8AM work. I kept oversleeping and thereby skipping workouts.  Now, I view exercise as a medicine to de-stress from my day at work.  It helps me build it into my schedule and gives me a real incentive to go: if I don't go, I'll feel much more anxious for the rest of the day because I haven't separated work and leisure in my mind."
DecidingToBeBetter,3bmnc8,mdawgig,6,Tue Jun 30 13:49:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for this reply. I have gone to therapy before for other reasons, but I also had to keep somewhat of a guard up (crappy situation that a family member got in and I had to protect certain elements of myself so that more crap wouldn't be started because of it). I am really looking forward to this time around in therapy when it is MY choice to be there. I am really hoping to nail down some of the things that you mentioned. I truly want to be better. I have such high aspirations for this life and the road that I am going on is keeping me in the bottom 5% of this country. I have to change. Honestly, if I don't then I am not too far off from a life of deep depression and possibly worse. I worry that if things get much worse than I will just give up and throw myself 100% at the negative things in life. That worries the hell out of me and is one of the biggest motivators for me making the changes in my life at this point in time.   Thank you again for your words and your time writing your reply. It has helped out immensely!"
DecidingToBeBetter,3bmnc8,mdawgig,5,Tue Jun 30 14:54:15 2015 UTC,"I am really looking forward to this time around in therapy when it is MY choice to be there.    That sentence right there is all you need to get started!  Now, while I'm applauding you for that, I want to make sure that it's important to go to therapy and be totally honest whether you want to or not.  Despite the fact that it's one of my favorite times of the week, I still sometimes dread therapy for no particular reason.  Just like the situation I mentioned in my original post, I have to be honest with myself. ""While not going to therapy might be what I want to do now, if I don't go, I'm going to be very anxious about these issues all week. It would be better to talk for an hour, as boring/exhausting/whatever as it seems right now, than to have that stuff hanging over me for a longer period of time.""  Another problem I had in therapy (that I know for a fact many of my friends face too) is the desire to 'save face' by not showing the particlarly embarrasing sides of ourselves.  DON'T DO THAT! Don't waste therapy sessions lying! It's another example of something that feels good at the time but is detrimental in the long-run. I totally understand that sometimes those deep-set excuses are covers for secrets we wish to ignore - hell, it took my therapist literally saying ""I think you're gay and don't want to admit it"" before I even thought about coming to terms with my sexuality. It took him saying ""I think your relationship with depressants is unhealthy"" before I even considered that my smoking habit was a symptom of my anxiety/depression.   Done right, therapy is hard at times.  It's gonna feel like you're ripping off band-aids attached directly to your soul sometimes. It's gonna hurt.  Lean into that hurt and trust me - please trust me - you'll come out the other side with a lighter heart and mind."
DecidingToBeBetter,3bmnc8,Ada1629,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"I've been going to therapy for the last 12 years, different therapists, all over the country.   Not once have I cried, not once have I felt the bandaid rip.  It kinda sorta maybe helped, sometimes with some things.  But no revelations no tears no sweat and therefore no gain I suppose.  But I tried!  To the best of my knowledge I didn't lie or hide things....I tried being brutally honest....I thought about my sexuality whether or not deep down I was gay, but no, not at all.  I thought about something traumatic happening...nope.  I know I could be in such deep denial that I don't know even know I'm lying but no therapist has picked up on it?  I haven't picked up on it?   So what's going on?  When do I get my breakthrough therapy moment?"
DecidingToBeBetter,3bmnc8,mdawgig,3,Wed Jul 1 03:59:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think that what I'm talking about is a ""breakthrough therapy moment"" per se, but rather a radical change in perspective that is more gradual than it might seem in hindsight.  I'm glad that you've gone to therapy for so long without feeling the need to hide significant things.  It's possible that for you, therapy is more of a way of processing everyday emotions and gaining different types of perspective that don't lend themselves to giant breakthroughts, but rather steady improvements in day-to-day life.  I've always thought that the hardest part of therapy is knowing whether it's working or not; most of the 'big' moments I described above were only important after the fact.  So, without trivializing your reasons for needing therapy, maybe you aren't caught up on large life-altering revalations but rather the intricacies and complexities of everyday life."

DecidingToBeBetter,3bmnc8,ms_abominable,3,Thu Jul 2 01:05:00 2015 UTC,"While you're looking for a therapist I highly suggest a book called ""Transforming Your Dragons"" by José Stevens. It has been critical in helping me reframe how I see my addictive personality. What I've learned along the way is that I go from self-destructive to greedy as a coping mechanism. Having the epiphany that when you come from some sort of abusive environment as a child, YOU end up taking on the role of ""abuser"" to yourself was so deep it changed me at the core.   It is a great read at worst, life changing at best. Let me know if it helps :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,3bmnc8,ColonelBuster,11,Tue Jun 30 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"""If some is good more is better and all of it is the fucking best"".  That's how I had lived for a long time.  I've found a few things to be particularly helpful:   Meditation helps with following the impulses back to their source and understanding the underlying feeling that's driving me to the behaviour. Being the observer of the impulse instead of being carried away in it allows me to ask myself ""is this serving me?"".  Set goals. Having something I'm working towards allows me to contrast the outcome of the impulses that aren't serving me with my goals I'm working towards and makes it an easy decision to let the impulse go.  Exercise daily, preferably in the morning before you start your day. It's amazing to me how much exercise helps clear my head, and exercising early helps set the intention for a healthy and productive day.  It's hard to want to hit the bong after I've ran a few miles and am already thinking about healthy habits I want to enable through the rest of my day.  Momentum is a very real thing. Use it to your advantage."
DecidingToBeBetter,3bmnc8,ColonelBuster,6,Tue Jun 30 14:38:33 2015 UTC,"""If some is good more is better and all of it is the fucking best""   That pretty much sums up a lot of different elements of my life right now, and is the exact opposite of how I want to live.  Here's one thing that is bugging me quite a bit and I am hoping therapy will help me work through - this does not line up with what I desire out of life. I know that I should be meditating, and I know all of the helpful benefits of it. I know that diet and exercise is key to becoming the person that I want to be and I know how to get started down that path. I know that a life of excess is bad and I know that indulging in things in moderation is key to a happy and fulfilled life. I know that setting goals and taking action to achieve those goals is how to improve.   The problem is that I simply can not get started on it. I have struggled with taking that first step. I have struggled with staying committed. For years I have put on the mask that I am this person that meditates, eats a clean diet, and exercises because it is how I want others to perceive me.  It is almost as if I have this alternate reality that I force myself to be in when others are around so that I appear to be a better person, and then when I am alone with my thoughts the real me shuts out the alternate me and the indulgence begins.  I know that these are all things that I will need to work through with a therapist, but I greatly appreciate your response. Reading this and then replying to it has really made me realize that therapy is the way that I need to go, and I need to dive head first into that process of improvement. It has also allowed me to get my thoughts out ""in public"" and will help me to address these things with the therapist in a couple weeks.  Thank you again for your response."

I know when I'm not flourishing I feel like I know all the things I have to do but I'm not doing them and it's so easy to beat myself up about it. It's a vicious cycle.  You can't get caught up in the ""I shoulds"" and ""I oughts"".  The key I've found is to pick one healthy habit and do it every day, come hell or high water for a month. (Start small!) Within a week I always feel like I'm turning a corner and want to add more healthy habits - that's great and perfectly natural, just remember anything on top of your first habit is gravy.  I like to think of it like you're the captain of a huge fucking ship at sea. You know the direction you want to go but it takes a while to get it turned around. The key is to keep facing the right direction and have faith the ship is turning.  Yes, there are 400 things you feel like you should be doing to be a ""good"" human but here's the secret: You already are. It's all a matter of perspective and our perspective can be awful limited when we're in a rut.

DecidingToBeBetter,3bmnc8,smashingjack,3,Tue Jun 30 16:15:12 2015 UTC,"So, I wouldn't call myself an expert in this area, but I do research on addiction. One theory is that addiction is the result of 1) loss of control and 2) strong urges/cravings. I think you could try to address this in two ways then.   1) Try to increase your self control (e.g., possibly through meditation, etc.). By the same token, some suggest that ""willpower is a muscle,"" so not pushing yourself too hard in others areas of your life might give you more resistance to these urges.  2) Try to decrease the urge for these innately rewarding behaviors. The best way I can think to do that is to make sure you have positive experiences/rewards sprinkled throughout your day, so there's less allure for these rewards at the end of a day/week (e.g., no saying, ""I've earned this beer"", which turns into 6, 8, or 10).   Again, I can't call this a cure-all, but maybe there's some nuggets in there that you'll find helpful. Good luck!"

DecidingToBeBetter,3bmnc8,TankVet,2,Tue Jun 30 13:33:42 2015 UTC,"The key aspect in my personal experience is to understand that life is like water. The urges come and the urges go. Water is never stable. It can be disrupted by the surrounding elements. Understanding that the disturbance is only temporary is essential, because addiction warps reality. That said when you're confronted with the urge to indulge in addictions or addictive behavior it will only be up to you what you decide to do. Therapy is important to have, but self therapy is very important too. A therapist can be an outside observer to our behaviors, but when we are alone we have to be the ones watching our thoughts and actions. I have some pieces of advice I can give aside from all the kind of random thoughts I put out already: 1. If you don't already understand how the brain works, towards addiction specifically, I would check it out. It will give you a much better realization of how powerful addiction is on even a chemical level. 2. Work on confidence in yourself. Do your best at every aspect of your life whether it is diet, exercise, meditation,etc.. You trying and not succeeding is still a success. That is kind of a contradiction, but it is true. If you just call it quits that is when we lose. 3. Don't make expectations. When I expect a specific thing and don't get it I feel failure and beat myself up about it. Which adds a new stress to life that makes it that much harder to overcome the urges of addiction. 4. Make goals specifically S.M.A.R.T. goals. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria   On Wikipedia it talks mainly about using this in management, but it can be used personally also. It makes it possible to not just be broad in goal setting like saying ""I'm just not going to drink ever again"", which will be bound to fail if that is way out of our realistic zone of achievement.  I'm not any kind of expert in the field of addiction. I just have been through my own struggles and hope that some of the things I have put can help you as they have me. I am curious, if you are willing to share, how long has this struggle been going on? I don't know you personally, but to even post about this on Reddit is moving in the right direction."
DecidingToBeBetter,3bmnc8,SomervilleSinner,2,Tue Jun 30 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"SMART criteria:       SMART is a mnemonic acronym, giving criteria to guide in the setting of objectives, for example in project management, employee-performance management and personal development. The letters S and M usually mean specific and measurable. The other letters have meant different things to different authors, as described below. Additional letters have been added by some authors.  SMART criteria are commonly attributed to Peter Drucker's management by objectives concept.  The first-known use of the term occurs in the November 1981 issue of Management Review by George T.

DecidingToBeBetter,3bmnc8,alexr1090,2,Tue Jun 30 23:30:13 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, good habits can be addictive too. Look at the ultra-marathon runners. Workaholics. Adrenaline junkies. Yogi's. Monks. Minimalists. Self-sufficients.  I've been an addict to most of these. Alcohol, drugs, and porn too. But I think the positive addictions help balance the bad addictions. It's a balance, and the more you can push your addictive nature onto positive addictions, the better you will be.   Each of these additions powers amazing accomplishments. Try to become addicted to good things. It's a real challenge, there is a delayed gratification a lot of the time, but very satisfying once you figure it out."

Being able to say 'fuck it' isn't just saying it, it's about accepting that an action has some negative consequences and deciding those consequences are ok. In my head you've been in so much 'pain' or 'duress' (not physical pain, I'm using it much more broadly than that) that a little more just doesn't register in that context."

DecidingToBeBetter,3bmua4,justinspiquotes,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:44:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry I'm so late to reply. I'm still a bit of a reddit newbie and forgot to check my alerts.  From the Zen/Buddhist perspective it's essentially a side benefit of meditation. Meditation is about practicing the perspective of observing but not engaging with your thoughts. For example instead of thinking about a crummy job, feeling sad, and engaging with the sadness, a practiced meditator starts to see the emotion as something separate from themselves. They start to identify at the observer of the emotion rather than the emotion itself.  To make it more relevant to you, meditating would let you observe being tired or lazy in the morning as a phenomena without having to identify it as something you are.   Do you play computer games? Let's say you're playing a game where your avatar can be tired. In this game, that can make you simply less efficient at tasks or completely unable to do tasks, but you as the player still get to decide exactly what you want to do.  That's the next step. Once you have that perspective, make your choices from there.  I'll freely admit I'm still exploring this perspective myself so this might be a little confused. But hopefully it helps."
DecidingToBeBetter,3bmua4,House_of_Atreus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:21:44 2015 UTC,"I've never liked the idea of meditation as a way to spend time; more precisely, I stood firmly against it for as long as I remember, for no reason other than it repels me on a level I don't comprehend fully. Therefore, it looks as if I'm learning to apply the same idea that you've described just now to at least a part of my life: just now I've returned from a walk around the city where I was in the state that you've described: of a certain distance between my feelings and my mind, where I could describe what I'm feeling and, often, why I'm feeling it. It was a more aware, less intuitive type of the state that I've felt as described in the OP.  I am, too, not aware of how did I achieve that, or what happened in my head that I've came to that. I can tell you, however, the chain of events that led to the state.  I was depressed and growing apathetic in the last two days, most likely because I've missed the alarm clock twice and woke up several hours too late (got in bed by 23:00, the alarm was set to 5:30, woke up around 9:00). I dropped physical exercise that I was so excited about lately and entertained myself with watching YouTube videos and eating a whole lot of stuff I didn't want to eat, like the sweet/sour kiwi pie (which is very heavy on the stomach) along with other overly-sweet stuff. Today, I decided to give masturbation a shot, since I've known it to relax me afterwards; I did it twice in a row, which got me (seemingly) very tired, and then the state started to go over me, without me noticing; in half an hour, I've been in my most aware of my emotions and most in control of them in months, the OP day excluded.  I'm not tired right now, but after such a session of false sex I know I should be. It's an odd sequence of events that led me where I am now, and I'd prefer not to rely on it, but it did help."
DecidingToBeBetter,3bmtml,GoodTravelYoung,4,Tue Jun 30 14:16:45 2015 UTC,"First thing in the morning, I drink a 32 oz bottle of water, and smoke a sizeable bowl of sativa weed. Then, I make myself a decent breakfast and a cup of black coffee. Then I jerk off, do yoga for one hour, work out for one hour, and shower.   I have severe ADHD, and used to rely on Adderall, but since taking the time to incorporate yoga and a workout regimen, I find that I have enough focus to carry me through most days, as long as I have another coffee at some point. I make a point to reward myself first thing in the AM. This leaves me with just things that have to be done for the rest of the day. Of course, I do get up at 5:30 in order for this to have me ready for work by 8, but it is a small price to pay."

DecidingToBeBetter,3bmtml,gotja,2,Wed Jul 1 03:18:23 2015 UTC,"I like the journaling idea. I've been experimenting with journaling concepts.  I started out with Morning Pages (see Julia Cameron's Artist's Way). Basically first thing every morning you dump out everything that comes to mind in long hand (stopping at 3 pages). I found I was full of negativity and it sent me into a downward spiral. Cameron recommends that you keep doing it, negative or not, but I had to stop because I was sliding into a depression.  I quite morning pages entirely and wrote 3 gratitudes at the end of every day, I found that helped massively.  I've tried various modifications of the morning pages method. I tried writing two and a half pages and reframing some of my thoughts at the end. I've tried finishing with gratitudes. I've tried something a friend of mine called scripting (where you write as if you're living your dream life now).  I find I can't stick to it, because I'm forced to go for all three pages.  If it's short, I can do it every day. I found I can write morning pages within a pomodoro, but that still seems too long for me to keep in a routine. I might cut it down to ten. But sometimes I do need to dump things out in a longer dump. Not sure how to create a routine out of that.   I have a hard time with routines because I flux so much.  I have a dilemma between writing in the morning and writing in the evening. I think it's best if the night before I do my gratitudes and outline for the day so when I wake up in the morning I don't miss stuff. But writing in the morning is best for processing."

Before you approach, make eye contact with the target -- not too intense -- then smile and nod. Approach, offering a handshake if it feels right. Say hi and introduce yourself. If it's a group, acknowledge everyone in turn, with eye contact. Go into your bit: ""I heard you speak about the Jabberwocky Project, really impressed me. I'd like to know more."" Something like that. Find a hook. Get them talking about themselves. It's often a good idea to focus on their interests and accomplishments than their appearance. Be interested but somewhat casual, don't be intense. It may take a while before you're able to do this approach naturally. Practice, practice, practice."

DecidingToBeBetter,3bkyde,lyssavirus,2,Tue Jun 30 06:21:59 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're looking to strike a balance between being outgoing and respecting other people's boundaries.  The moment that a person starts to seem 'stalkerish', or just an asshole, occurs when they disregard some personal boundary that I have tried to establish. Especially if I have to reassert the boundary multiple times.  An example of this could be probing questions that don't stop after I've made it clear that I don't want to talk about a topic.  I think if you are actually genuinely interested in someone, and you try to understand and respect their personal boundaries, you'll do just fine.  It's also worth mentioning that boundaries are dynamic. If a person is closed off about something one day, they may be more open the next. Try not to get too bogged down in defining a person by their boundaries, but give them the space to share personal things if and when they want to."

If you approach a situation fearing seeming 'stalkerish' or 'nosy' then that is almost definitely the vibe that you will be putting out.  It's also worth putting out there that a lot of people neither want or appreciate attention. That's not a criticism on you at all, but worth baring in mind.  My advice would be rather than ask questions, listen. A good listener will almost always be told without having to ask. Try not to steer conversations in a particular direction to extract information, it will come across as manipulative, the exact opposite of what you want.  Be present in the conversation that is happening, not in the one you want to happen.   I hope that helps :-)"

Find something about them you are genuinely interested in, duh! The quicker you find it, the more fun you have.   The reason this can seem so difficult to connect with people comes from this sort of feeling of inferiority and separation from that person you are talking to. Take some time to see if you feel like that.   Because the truth is, you're just another person in this world of 7 billion. So relax a little, this person doesn't have to connect with you, and you don't have to connect with them.   Finally, the easiest way to get over this is just be a genuinely interesting person yourself. Give it about a year. Keep up with mainstream crap, but only to make fun of it as an icebreaker, be weird about what you like, treat people with kindness, try new things.   But if all of that fails, my go-to question instead of, ""Where do you work"" is, ""What are you working on these days?"" Usually someone is going to talk about their passion project if they have one. That's a way more fun conversation."
DecidingToBeBetter,3bkyde,TheCurseOfJamesDolan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:07:05 2015 UTC,"""Genuine interest"" can be impossible. I think that's a buzz phrase that originates from Dale Carnegie (though I might be wrong on that aspect). It feels like a manipulative concept. Because, as stated, it can be impossible to force genuine interest. You end up faking it to get a goal like them liking you. It's deceitful.  It's less about conveying ""genuine interest"" in another person and more about learning to stop talking about yourself.  Almost everyone, including myself, have an impulse to inject themselves into conversations (hint: I just did it). Most people want to talk about themselves, tell stories about themselves, brag about themselves, show off their intelligence and more. That's a bad character trait.  Like the planet said to the sun, not everything in the universe revolves around you. You don't have to be the focus of every conversation. You don't have to try and steal the focus when people aren't paying attention to you.  Ask people about themselves, their life, their interests and allow that to guide the conversation. That doesn't mean you can't ever talk about yourself. If something interesting is happening to you, then it's certainly fine to mention. Just don't always focus on yourself. When you reach a topic you have interest in, then feel free to delve further into it. Bring up your interests and move forward."

There are things I enjoy, but something always gets in the way, or I wind up sacrificing them for other people. The second someone's upset I'm not doing something for them, it's dropped. It makes me angry that I've been trained to do that, it's very hard to undo now.   I've been trying to figure out how to switch off that mechanism and change it to something else. It's definitely a behavioral change and I'm trying to figure out what I can do to change it. I know there must be something, I've stumbled across DBT and that changed my life in a lot of ways, my depression is half of what it was before, which is a fucking miracle, but there's still more. Not sure what to find next. What is the thing I need to learn and how do I find it?  I love biking, but I don't have a bike. I love taking photos but I don't have a camera. I love aquariums, but I keep moving and my life is unstable, so I dropped that hobby. I love cats, but I keep moving and my life is unstable (not to mention the men I date don't like cats or are allergic). I love hiking and being out in nature, but I can't bring myself to do it unless someone else makes me. I enjoy traveling, if I can get over my anxiety of leaving my comfort zone. The traveling I can let go of for now, I don't have the budget and the anxiety is much stronger, there are other things I can tackle first. Traveling takes a big emotional hit out of me so I reserve energy for that.  There are a lot of things I'd like to do, but they're for me, so I lose motivation. If it's for someone else I can do it.

DecidingToBeBetter,3bhotv,sadku,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:50:35 2015 UTC,"I've found that I'm more successful by adding good habits than at restriction.  I used to live off a junk food diet. Every time I tried a diet that restricted ""foods I shouldn't eat"" I failed.  So I decided that I would set goals of adding in vegetables to my meals. For a couple of weeks I measured out one cup of frozen veggies, that I would eat no matter what. Then two cups.   I fail at three cups. There's something about it that seems too daunting. I can do my two cup minimum very easily each day. So I set my minimum at two cups. And since I have a habit of overdoing things and wanting ""more"", I actually more often then not, ""overdo"" eating vegetables and wind up with eating more than two cups. I actually have an instant gratification desire to overeat vegetables sometimes, and now I sometimes crave kale instead of ice cream and want to binge on it. Because I was meeting my goal, and eating vegetables, I started feeling better and wanting them more. And ate less junk food as a result of that. So basically my ""weakness"" is now working to my advantage. My body craves vegetables. I got myself ""hooked"" on them.  I sometimes slide into not eating vegetables, because I get lazy and don't want to cook them, so when that happens, I swing the balance the other way again. I start eating my minimum of two cups a day of frozen veggies I can heat in the microwave and that kicks me back into the veggie cycle.  When I feel bad and want the instant gratification of something not healthy, say eating a whole pint of ice cream, I hesitate more often than not. I have a choice, it's not restricted. It's not a control issue. It's not about falling short. I think ""Well I could feel really good now and indulge in ice cream, but tomorrow I will feel depressed, lethargic, and crappy. I kinda don't want to feel depressed, lethargic, and crappy tomorrow because I want to get X done. I can have it another time."" Sometimes I decide ""Fuck it, I'm having the ice cream"" but it comes from a different attitude. I'm not ""slipping"" up, I'm actively choosing it."

You may know they are not right but they have not realised that.  Also, try to discover if you are projecting, is what you feel or think about people really how they are? Or how you really are?

I am trying instead to focus on what makes me feel contentment, as I grew tired to feeling depressed or disillusioned with the world (mostly humans).   Try to remind yourself that nice people do, in fact, exist. There are lot of shitty things in this world, but I would try to focus on what makes you happy and fulfilled. Maybe try meditation, picking up an inspirational book, or learning a new hobby. This will hopefully turn your attitude inward instead of focusing on the negativity surrounding you."

I think that contentment is a precursor to happiness. I feel like contentment is a state of mind, a sort of general disposition and attitude. I feel like happiness is more fleeting, though. It comes and goes in waves. I've always tried to cling to happiness when I feel it (and I've struggled a ton with depression and anxiety), but it always goes away at some point. I am learning, instead, to practice contentment with my life -- settling in to my experiences, whether they are good/bad/fun/terrible/whatever. Just accepting what is going on in the current moment. It is SO, SO much easier said than done, but I believe that with practice true change and contentment can come. I hope this helps in some way."
DecidingToBeBetter,3bgphn,Chalools,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:00:22 2015 UTC,"Something I've found to be helpful is to ask myself this question:  ""What could cause a rational human being do this?""  It's a combination of timing and questioning.  Usually, when I need to ask it is when I least want to -- emotionally, I've already decided that the other person is a waste of carbon, and I'd just as soon not burn any more of my life dealing with them.  So I'm learning to make myself stop, in the moment, and ask myself that question.  Even if the answers are speculative BS that make no sense to me, I allow myself to consider it.  It seems to often bring the logical portion of my brain back online, and from there, I can choose to try to understand what drives the other person.  It 'humanizes' the other person, allows me to defuse situations that could easily degrade, and lessens the impact of the (usually negative) narrative I've got going on in my head at the time.  ... though, to be honest, I'm still abysmal at the practice."

Not in the slightest, but that's what you see. I think you need to talk to a professional. I'm not saying this with malice, I am being genuine. It seems as though you're stuck in a negative mindset and you are anticipating everything will be an attack. I get it. I do that sometimes, but nine times out of ten, that's all in my head. Maybe even 9-1/2 times out of ten and the half a time when it is a genuine attack, I still don't have to respond in kind. I can approach the situation with love and realize that the other person is just afraid. Which is what I am doing with you right now.   My guess is that someone hurt you deeply when you were very young and this is the coping mechanism you adopted to protect yourself from further pain. Push people away right off the bat.

Yeah, there are ignorant assholes out there, but I really don't believe they're anywhere near a majority. And you don't have to subject yourself to reading shitty people's opinions on Facebook. If someone says something that rustles your jimmies, unfriend/unfollow them.   Another note, you should try exercises of perspective. It is okay to disagree with people, and it's okay to think they're a douchebag. But just take a moment to think about what possible situations in life might have led this person to what (s)he is today.   We're conditioned by our environment. A pretty big portion of who you are today is rooted in all the moments prior. Values your parents impressed on you, lessons learned from media, significant/defining moments, etc all play a vital part of who you are.   And some people weren't raised in the best environment. Some people were raised by racists. Some people never experienced love from their parents. Personal accountability is still a very big factor, but the saying ""The apple never falls from the tree."" Like the cliche of the school bully being bullied by father at home.   I think that if you do that, try to find their perspective, maybe you'll humanize them, even find a little bit of empathy for them. You don't have to agree with them, or like them, but just remember their the same imperfect species of creature as you."

Track it all and see exactly where you can improve. Small cuts are way easier than changing everything as you will likely just resent and stop using the app.  One more suggestion, don't lie to yourself. You eat a dove bar, you track it. You grab a handful of m&m's ... Track it.  Try to get at least 90g of protein or higher a day, it will keep you fuller.  Good luck!"

This way you can still eat whenever you feel like it pretty much.  Another way is to try intermittent fasting like the Fast 5 program. There is a free book available.

The right balance comes when you are exposed to people on a weekly basis but you are not even thinking about what others think, you don't feel lonely and you don't care if you meet no-one interesting.

It's very easy to become burnt out by trying to fix too many things at one time. In my experience, building consistent daily habits are the key to buildings happiness within oneself.   Sleep: This for me has been massively important. Always try to get at least 7 hours of quality sleep. Your quality of sleep will be better if you go to bed earlier (i.e. at around 10 pm) as opposed to staying in bed later. A trick I've used to make my sleeping habits become more consistent has been to each week get up/go to bed just 5 minutes earlier than the week before.  Exercise: This is great for building self confidence etc. You seem to be on the right track. In relation to going to the gym at times when it's empty, I have found that people in the gym environment will do the opposite of judge people. If I see a person who is very overweight in the gym, I commend them for taking action.  A few random tips; Drink loads of water, practice smiling when you are talking to people (even if you don't feel like it), make a list of all the successes you have had in life (PhD student, wealth, etc.) and make a list of affirmations that you say to yourself each and every day.

Try /r/malefashionadvice/ for help on getting a style and also just keep in mind that even basic grooming is very very important (brushed teeth, clean and brushed hair, etc).  Keep trying to love yourself and be comfortable being alone.  Once you're ready to move onto getting comfortable with people, take a look at /r/socialskills.    Keep in mind that everyone is weird/troubled in their own way.  This is important to remember when you feel the urge to get someone else's attention.

DecidingToBeBetter,3beges,Bdi89,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:57:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think that you need any tips from us. You just need the motivation to take control of the wheel and follow the road you want to go. You know the things you wanna change and I'm sure you also know how.  For example:    ""fear of spending my money"", ""no effort in my appearance"" -> buy some new close "" crash public lectures just for the free food"" -> now use it to talk to people (don't          be shy to ask for numbers, you will be shocked how easy people give them to you) ""I am trying to be more normal but I found that people still won't make any effort to get to know me.""  -> That exactly the problem which I'm fighting too. You try to be someone people would like. You are too scared of being you. How should people get to know you if you don't open yourself and actually let them.    The first step to fix this problem begins with the most important person in your life. That's you.  So begin to like it in your skin, you have no choice.  But you have the choice of taking care and  giving it love or ofc you can hate it, cry and be sad the rest of your life. Get to know yourself better.  Like, no, love yourself. Respect yourself. Set boundries and protect these  (really do what it takes in order to protect them!!!).   If you feel good, people automatically feel good about you too.   Man I talked too much.  I could go on and on and on but you already got the point.  If you want to get something of the chest you can always pm me."

DecidingToBeBetter,3bcwib,Pointwest418,2,Sun Jun 28 09:33:51 2015 UTC,"My apologies for those with limited time or attention, this ended up being a giant post, but I hope it helps  After reading one of brene brown's books, watching the ted talks, and trying to dive in to self acceptance on many different levels, I have found a practice that has helped me more than anything else: I appreciate what I like in other people.   Something that I have noticed in myself and that I believe alot of other people do (perhaps you?) is throwing judgements on other people to make myself feel better. I consider myself an open minded and accepting guy who is friendly to everyone, but have realized that I still defensively judge other people's weaknesses is a subtle way to feel better about myself. ex: I meet a guy that is really extroverted and outgoing but perhaps seems a litte arrogant. I will then focus my attention on the arrogant aspect that I dont like instead of the admirable outgoing nature in general. This is a defense mechanism I have developed and it allows me to not feel as threatened by his powerful presence because I have noticed an aspect of that presence that I feel superior to him in (“I’m not arrogant like that guy”).   ""But why is this bad? I am just noticing a quality in myself that I prefer to his"" you may say. First, no, you are noticing a quality in him that you are(supposedly) glad you lack. This is bad for two reasons: 1. it limits your own self-expression 2. it reflects how you expect other people to view you   How does it limit you own self-expression? Think about this: if you say to someone ""I hate people that listen to rap music; its so distasteful"", what are the chances of you ever giving rap music a chance? Its highly unlikely that you will truly find all rap music distasteful, with the great variety of rap music that exists, but if you do end up liking rap you risk being a hypocrite, and so you probably wont ever give rap music a change because that would conflict with your self-created self-image. Humans have a sociological drive to have a consistent self-image (see the book ""influence by Cialdini, or alternatively, read one paragraph on the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini#Six_key_principles_of_influence).  If you create the self-image of being someone who isn't like that guy by saying to yourself subtly ""I dont like people that are arrogant"", you are psychologically barring yourself from behaving like that person. Just like rap, there are many different types of ‘arrogant’, some of which may just be a healtyh sense of self-worth or confidence. Where is the line between being confident and arrogant? Was that guy really being arrogant or are your perceptions of what qualifies as arrogant skewed because you are so far on the otherside of the spectrum and are threatened by confident people?  If you are judging that guy from being arrogant, you are defining yourself by what you are not and this prevents you from feeling good about behaving like that guy did. It will fire off a subconscious alarm in your head that you are doing something inconsistent with your self-image.  When you judge people, you are creating psychological barriers against that same perceived behavior for yourself.  Second, when you look at other people in this subtly critical way, how does your perspective on other people change? How do you assume that they are seeing you? Speaking from personal experience, I can't read minds and so I pretty much assume on a subconscious level that most people think somewhat similarly to me (I don't literally have the conscious thought ‘I bet that person is thinking like me’, but when I am in public I tend to act as though other people have similar thought patterns). When you are negatively judging people, it just seems natural that other people are doing that to you (whether they are or not is beside the point). This obviously creates stifling of your personality as you try to adjust to prevent negative impressions from other people. However, if you start looking at people's positive aspects, then you will starting acting as though other people are viewing you in that same way. personality freedom!   So,   SOLUTION- Starting focusing on other people's positive qualities; the ones that you admire and want to incorporate into your own personality. When you are out in public, see what qualities you really dig and show appreciation for them. If someone is incredibly funny, instead of feeling threatened by them and labeling them as an attention-seeker, laugh and talk to them more. Be curious about what makes them so funny, joke with them. You could directly tell them that they are funny and that you appreciate that, but in most social situations I can imagine now that would be kind of odd, so laughing at their jokes will suffice.   Another thing that I do is spend 5 minutes a day thinking about someone that I dont necessarily like and I think about what qualities in them I appreciate and would like to have in myself. There is this one kid that I went to school with for 12 years who was always an asshole, but he was also confident and charismatic - ya i would totally love being more confident and charismatic, I admire him for that. Doing the 5 minutes a day thing makes it into a habit (try doing it at the same time every day, i reccomend right when you wake up), but it is also good practice for doing it in social situations.   How does it solve the two problems above? 1. If you switch to admiring people's qualities, you do not have the restrictive judgment consistency thing happening; in fact, you are exposed to a world where you get to express your personality in an infinite number of ways of your own choosing. 2. You start seeing people in a positive light and assume other people are doing the same for you (again, whether they do or not is irrelevant - I know this seems like a small point to gloss over, but I dont have space to address it here. some of the other responses have, and this subreddit is full of them. Also, if you are skilled at finding gems of insight in piles of anger, check out /r/TheRedPill - there are many great posts about dealing with rejection there).   Other reasons why this works: people love to be appreciated, sensing that vibe from you will draw people to you and fuel sincere friendship. Seeing people in a more positive light also makes you like people more which will motivate you to go out and be social more which will make you see people in a more positive light etc etc (thus creating a positive feedback loop of making friends).   This may seem like it lacks concreteness perhaps, since it is just about changing the way you see people, which is a difficult thing to tangibly grasp, but I'm telling you that I have been exactly where you are and still suffer from it to a lesser degree and this has been the biggest help to me. Having a mediation routine will make this easier and is just simply good for all areas of life.   Another point: you can, as I did, get lost forever in reading about how to overcome fear of vulnerability and love yourself and express your personality more, BUT IF YOU DONT TAKE CONRETE ACTION NOTHING WILL EVER CHANGE. Learning and reading are great, but absolutely useless if they aren't combined with concrete action. So try this 5 minutes a day thing and stick with it and see if you start to notice changes. If you dont notice any, then start a different routine or daily action towards your goal. But remember that a big part of success in any thing is sincerely trying the method, understanding why it works, and believing that it can work for you. Just make sure you are consistently moving towards your goal, and if you are, you will make progress. It is sometimes very difficult to notice changes that have to do with the way you see the world because they are all mental, but dont give up. Be proud of yourself for even making the effort, which is more than 99% of people do.  tl;dr  Most people judge other’s negative aspects to make themselves feel better when they compare themselves to others (e.g. that guy is arrogant), but this leads to 1)creating of psychological barriers against certain behaviors (e.g. ‘arrogance’, which could really just be confidence) that you have labeled as negative by the principle of self-image consistency and, (2) assumption that other people view you in the same way you view them (i.e. focusing on negative qualities). To fix these problems and feel better about yourself, start appreciating the qualities in others that you admire and would want to have yourself."

I can definitely be impatient and the moment I try something and don't see results, I give up because I think it won't work.

I consider it part of taking care of myself and my mental health. Days when I don't write, I definitely notice it and feel tense and on edge and it only goes away when I write. A large portion of what I write is just journaling to get thoughts out of my head, but the process of sitting down every day to do that has helped me make progress on more formal writing.  One of my main goals, long term, is to write books and for many years I only thought about it and had excuses for why I wasn't writing. (No ideas...) I'd buy nice notebooks and pens and never use them. I would blame not having a laptop. But about 2 years ago, I started trying to make daily writing a habit. It took about a year of wanting to form the habit before it actually became a consistent habit. At first, I'd only write a few hundred words every couple days, if that, and never anything memorable.   But over time, I've been writing more each day. I try to spend at least an hour and often two each day working at it. I used to have a hard time getting more than 750 words written at a time, but the past month or so it's getting closer to 2000 words every day (to be fair, most of it is crap). I don't think I've taken more than a few days off writing since the beginning of the year. I have a thin binder full of plain old college ruled paper that I try to keep near my bed or bring with me when I go out, when it gets full, I take pages out and put them in a larger binder for safe keeping. You don't need anything fancy, don't let that be an excuse! As time has gone by and this habit has gotten stronger, I've gotten more comfortable typing while I'm doing meaningful creative writing, but sometimes it really helps to hand write it first. Even when I'm on my laptop I like to have my binder nearby."

Stew says that rather than approach your life as a zero sum game (I.e. To work more, I need to sacrifice something else) he says you should think of creative solutions to merging the different spheres of your life. For example, organising a families BBQ party for your work would mean you win at both family time and work time. Doing a gym class with your spouse would mean you get healthy, but don't need to sacrifice time with them.  It's an interesting concept. I'd check it out."

To incorporate them into your thought process you can use a slightly different mindless technique.  Close your eyes, relax and focus on your breathing, every time you breath out you can say repeat a word or phrase associated with your values. As you do this, the important thing is to not 'hold' on to your automatic thoughts, but simply return your attention to your breathing and the phrase."

Well, I actually have a psych background and can offer some real help other than ""carbs are making you angry"" or ""your values are all wrong"".  This will take some back-and-forth to needle out specifics, but I can tell you from the getgo you're having a huge issue with powerlessness.  You are in a bizarre situation that you don't want to be in, and for reasons that aren't clear, you are continuing to tolerate.  I can't emphasize this enough--you are in a position that is making you fantastically unhappy, because your control over your life is pitiful.  You are angry because you are being stepped on and treated like you don't matter.  You are ""all about rules"" because they are a weak exertion of the only control you seem to have.  I cannot imagine what it would feel like to be imprisoned in a place where some loathed person can show up at any time.  I cannot imagine what it would be like to have nobody with anything nice to say to me.  What you are doing is reflected in the adage ""cut someone else down to feel taller"".  You feel small, so you feel better about yourself if you can find flaws in someone else.  The first and foremost issue you need to address is, how can you get out of this living situation.  I don't know who convinced you it's acceptable or why you're tolerating it, but it is going to wring all the happiness out of you.  Even if you feel like you need to take a risk or a step down in station to get some freedom, you should do it.  Working for minimum wage so you can go home to a tiny apartment and be yourself / do whatever you want is 100x healthier than living in a mansion where everybody treats you like shit.  I hope you can get some help."

The people around me, family members and my boyfriend, are pleasant people though one member (the parent) really grinds my gears sometimes. They don't insult me or put me down in any way. In fact, they make an effort to ask me if I'm okay and things like that. They're supportive folks. Unfortunately, I am paranoid that there's underlying things going on behind their kindness. These people aren't two-faced, I'm just cuckoo-for-cocoa puffs about suspecting people aren't as they portray because I am easy to criticize the people around me. If I'm guilty of it, then I'm paranoid everyone else is. I hate that issue and need to fix it.   The problem is that the parent figure I am frustrated with kind of invites this negative person into our lives non-stop because it's an abusive relationship. He's broken things. He's hurt her. He's hurt his kid. Made threats. You get the gist. Naturally, I hate his guts because despite all of his bad feats and being told he's not allowed here, he still shows up. Police don't get involved because of the timing of the situation and it has to be the homeowners that call because it's their property. So, every time he shows up, it's a waggle of the finger and he huffs and leaves. But the fact he shows up, smug and all, makes my blood boil. I lose it every time I see his face. It's pure hate and I wind up hating myself for getting angry when the people around me handle their cool a million times better/contain it better.  As for my living situation, it's a particularly special one where I'm in a position where I must solely work from home and cannot venture out into the world unless it's for errands. So, I cannot work a minimum-wage job like I used to. I live in Texas and the most affordable apartment I could find that isn't in an area where I should be worried for my safety every time I open the door is in the $600 ball-park. Add on various bills and my monthly earnings are eaten up and I may not scrape by. I don't own a car nor can I afford one either. Luckily, I do work online but barely bring in $200 a week. There's other personal factors into play that I can't mention but that's the gist of why I can't leave.   And you were an awesome help! I greatly appreciate the insight and that you took your time to not only read my long post but write such a meaningful response. :)"

Honestly, this sounds to me like the epitome of a living situation where you feel powerless, out of control, and difficult to tolerate, and that's without even touching on the people who frustrate you or other personal factors.    For the very first step in moving past your temper and control problems, I would suggest looking into ways that help you mentally accept your living situation (if you can't leave it) and also ways to carve out regular time and space where you ARE in control, even if it's just meditating or exercising in your room by yourself.  Getting a handle on the source problem will help you eventually deal better mentally with the rest of the irritants in your life, which are causing the anger symptoms that you are trying to change."
DecidingToBeBetter,3b5dmq,photios-knut,5,Fri Jun 26 13:23:48 2015 UTC,"The pithy answer is this: You're impeded and frustrated in life because you have the wrong values. Instead of valuing what is in your power, what your character is, you place your value on the actions of others.  You're angry because you expect things to go as you want and want to harm others when they don't do what you want. Or perhaps your anger is directed more at Nature in general, as mine sometimes is.  I'd suggest /r/stoicism and reading Epictetus's Handbook as a starting point"

You might need to change your diet. In some cases, what you eat can have a huge effect on how your think and how your brain works.   This might be something worth looking at.   http://www.amazon.com/Grain-Brain-Surprising-Sugar--Your-Killers/dp/031623480X  The only other thing to add...is that your brain is programmed. Not just your brain, but all of our brains. So...if you want a change you have to deprogram what is there, and then program what you want.   THAT will not start until you write it down as to what you want.   Most of this is way beyond me, but there are plenty of great books on it."

You didn't ask about your psychology though, you asked for tips, so here is one.  You know what's holding you back (internet) but you keep doing it. That isn't going to work. You're trying to fail, right? So stop that self-sabotage. Knowing that something is a problem and continuing to do it reinforces that it's a problem you can't solve which makes you continue to do it.  It's a pattern. You have to interrupt it to find a new one.  Start next week with one thing. One habit. I don't care which one except that it has to have simple, achievable steps. They can and SHOULD be RIDICULOUSLY small. Like ""get to bed on time every night"", ""don't use the internet for one hour of free time a day"" or smaller.  Now get a calendar. Every day you do or don't do that one thing, put a big fat X through that day.  Every day you will prove you achieved something. Every day you will prove that you are progressing.  By the end of the week, you can't lie to yourself and say you didn't do anything or make any progress. It's right there - a neat row of X's. You did that.   Next week do the same thing. Make a new goal to do in addition to your first one. Or increase the depth of your first goal (like 1/2 to 1hr. of something or 10 pushups turns into 20 pushups).   Because you're inclined to overwhelm yourself, keep these things SMALL and ACHIEVABLE.   You have to ramp up SLOWLY.  I can't reinforce the slowly enough. If you overwhelm yourself then you reaffirm that you're overwhelmed and won't do anything. We're trying to break that overwhelm you inflict on yourself for trying to be better. We're done with that. You're doing things now.  Remember this too. Doing one thing - even a small thing is more progress than doing nothing.

It was set so at midnight, I'd be thrust off; if you're familiar with the app, it just does a total Internet blackout for the duration of the time the  proverbial reactor is nuclear. This was absolutely necessary in first and second year of uni, when I basically had insomnia anyway so needed all the sleep I could get. But my basic sleep hygiene problem has changed in the past 12 months, from struggling to fall asleep due to worries, to just staying up ridiculously late worrying and seeking out help [or I hate to say jacking off to porn yes]  But these days I use my dad's Mac more than that, because the battery has died, the RAM is a lot bigger, faster Internet connection etc. Unfortunately for all of Safari's perks, I'm yet to see anything which gives me an immediate permanent Internet blackout at any time I choose. The closest I have is SelfControl, and AFAIK that's manual setup (as in, you have to 'push the button'-with StayFocusd Nuclear option, the button pushes itself automatically once you input the time for it to do so as I say above)   Do you have a book out and ready to go?

I've gotten better at dealing with it, to the point that I'll realize I just dropped something or knocked something over and I'll catch it before it hits the ground. I think my clumsiness comes from an inability to focus on my body and whatever else I'm doing at the same time. I'm the most clumsy when I'm distracted by talking, thinking really hard about something, or trying to self soothe after an anxiety attack.

She drops and spills things so frequently and it drives me crazy. I know she most likely will grow out of it but my frustration comes from not trying extra hard or not paying extra attention to spillables. Just tonight, she was taking sliced olives out of a can and managed to drop the whole thing on the ground. She said she didn't see that coming. I, and I am not proud of it said, ""you drop or spill stuff all the time, why didn't you see it coming?"" It is frustrating to me, I want her to have an awareness, a special focus on it but alas.

I think part of the reason they help is that they both encourage me to remember that I'm not a brain in a vat. It took me a long time to connect my mind and body into one being, if that makes sense. Doing familiar physical exercises and focusing only on what my body is doing helps to reinforce it's importance.      A few questions about your daughter, if you don't mind. Does she get picked on or excluded for the way she looks?      Also, is she emotionally sensitive?"

DecidingToBeBetter,3b5qqe,motherofkatana,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:15:39 2015 UTC,"That is interesting to me. I've always reflected on how my extreme emotional sensitivity has affected the way I live. I think I tend to live in my head as a defense against the sometimes cruel outside world. I like to think it's made me more sensitive to other people's feelings and needs but it can also be debilitating in that I tend to hyperfocus on analyzing my feelings to the detriment of my physical health. If I could go back in time and give advice to my parents on helping me become a healthier adult, I'd say make sure to stress the importance of caring for her physical self as an extension of her emotional self. Regular exercise and drinking plenty of water were things I knew were good for you but didn't realize the balancing effect of until I was an adult. Mostly, try to make sure she has someone adult-like (older cousin/family friend/youngish uncle or aunt) who has her best interests at heart that she can talk to. If you need to set up a counselor for her to talk to, please do so. I've noticed it's important for me and many of my ""sensie"" friends to verbally process our feelings and realize that not everyone feels as strongly, as intimately, as we do.      Also, doing focusing exercises like guided meditation or yoga can be helpful. If she seems interested in any martial art or focus based physical expression, piano or swimming or playing the drums, try to encourage it as much as you can. Remember that kids get bored easily, and part of growing up is not surrendering to boredom but working through it and learning good habits.      Sorry, I went off on a bit of a tangent. I'm in my late twenties and realizing just how much I have yet to learn. I wish I'd had a safe space to be listened to and I wish I had felt more connected to my body."

A helpful response to the next time she spills something/knocks something over might be ""Hey Katana? What were you thinking about when you spilled those olives? It looked like you were lost in thought, so I wondered."" Take a moment between the act and the question so you can ask in a non-frustrated way and so she won't be so embarassed that she shuts down. She likely won't tell you no matter how you ask but that's not really the point. The point is to get her thinking about why she wasn't tracking her hands."

I was always raised & taught that I needed to go to school, go to a special high school, go to college, go to med school, then ""success"".  I got to a college degree before I lost my shit and cracked from under all the pressure.  My grades bottomed out, I was fantastically unhappy and I was literally spending all my time playing video games.  My very-strict academic mother was done screaming abuse at me, handed me $2300 and told me to ""get out of her life"".  I took the $2300, moved 1000 miles away to a completely strange place with a car full of stuff and rented a room.  Got a job as a bouncer, then as a lab tech.  Finished my degree, got a job working for DHS.  Got the American Dream, then realized it was all shit and I hated my life.  Moved away, started over, checked out nursing.  Decided that's what I wanted to do, ended up having to get ANOTHER degree so I could bring my grades up.  Took me a semester, now I'm 35 and couldn't be happier.  Remember, when you're trying to get somewhere, there are no steps ""backwards"".  There are only steps.  And if you can't find your way, STOP with all the ""career"" bullshit and just try living to be happy for a while.  Things can't fall into place if there's so much stress that there's no space."

DecidingToBeBetter,3b47hg,faraztheworthy,2,Fri Jun 26 02:38:03 2015 UTC,"I still think most of us get to decide how successful we'll be by the amount of energy we put into it.  Most of us decide we aren't willing to do absolutely anything to be extremely successful, so we're not.  We ARE limited by many things in our environment, and by our god-given innate talents,  but not as much as we limit ourselves by the fact that we like being comfortable, and having nice things, and spending our time having a good time, etc.  A few people are lucky enough to be born into wealth, so they can have just about any material thing they want without much effort.  The rest of us have to make sacrifices of some kind.  Most of us would rather have children, for instance, than a million dollars in the bank.  We're now told that it costs almost 300k to raise a child in these times.  I don't think that includes the expense of what you gave up, simply in time and effort to raise a child, that could've been used to further one's success in a given field.  But, for you, the first thing to do is whatever it takes to lose the belief that you can't be as successful as you really want to be.

DecidingToBeBetter,3ay554,beholdtherage,12,Wed Jun 24 13:07:21 2015 UTC,"That is an incredible achievement. Congrats. And, yes, you totally do inspire me with the post. So thanks for that.  You aren't just dropping pounds. You're changing your life.  ALL OF YOUR STRATEGIES ARE RIGHT and that's why you're seeing results: daily exercise, conscious meal planning, and, most importantly, tracking your meals and exercise to give you a clear understanding of what you are doing each day (tests have shown that tracking is the #1 thing that helps with a life change like this).  I did want to offer up some thoughts for you if you'd like (having been someone who has gone up and down on the scales many times). They might help you as you carry on down this road (which I'm still on - I'm typing this at my treadmill desk at the moment).  1) The more specific your tracking, the better. I use the Lose It! app on my phone (free - there are tons like it) to track exactly what calories and nutrients I'm getting. I'm guessing you've got something in place for this - just mentioning it in case you don't.  Specific tracking is better when it comes to calories out too. To know your maintenance calories, you need a definite body weight to work with. I hate scales but have come to enjoy them as I've changed. It's a tool - my relationship to it is different.   I say this because at ""around 300lbs"", your maintenance calories (ie. without any exercise) are very likely 3000+ (I can't accurately ball park it without your age and weight - a ton of sites on line can calculate it). Add with the exercise you mention, and you are probably in the 4000-5000 range.   All of this is hard to know without measuring and it's very important to get specific about it because:  A) the work you are doing is nothing short of incredible and I personally would love you to see that in black and white. The change you've made isn't little and the fact that you find it pretty easy speaks to how hard you work and your dedication as a person. Be proud. I'm proud of you and I don't even know you.  B) As your body and activity levels change, you will have to adjust your eating as well. Some people hit a wall as they eat the same calories but their base metabolism has dropped so they need fewer calories. You won't have that problem at 1,500 calories which brings me to the next thing I wanted to offer up.  2) Eating. If you are eating 1,500 calories and burning (let's guess conservatively) 4,000 then you are running a daily deficit of 2,500 calories. You are eating 167% less that your body needs to maintain its weight.  This is a MASSIVE deficit (hence the massive weight loss). Most people recommend running a max of a 20% deficit. I tend to run way higher a deficit then that because I just don't want to wait to lose pounds. I'm not telling you what to do but I am trying to illustrate what proper calculations can tell you. Making informed choices is really important.  The other important thing you can start to consider is not how much you are eating but what you are eating. I'm struggling with this right now. I've started to think of my body like a factory - what I put in is what I get out. Stuff like: if I eat enough protein, I will lose less muscle. Or like: if I can eat 500 calories of something should it be something that helps my body and me or something that hurts it? Just something I found helps me (just a little further down my road of weight loss than you).  My third thought:  3) Weight training. Again, you are totally doing the exact right thing by lifting. It's awesome. You can enjoy so much more with this. If you feel like it and like weights, you can find some great, simple, fast programs to do. I did and it was a game changer because:  a) You burn calories lifting weights. It isn't as intense as say swimming in terms of numbers but it's around walking quickly levels (at least for the kind of workout routine I have). So now 1/2 hr. lifting gives my calorie burn and makes me stronger. Walking can't do that.  b) Muscle loss (as you pointed out) can happen when you're shedding pounds. Weights can help counteract that.  c) You think you're happy when you look in the mirror and see that weight loss? If you train weights a little more, you'll see muscles show up from under all the pounds you lose. I cannot tell you how good this feels in terms of motivation, self-image, happiness.  d) It feels GOOD to feel strong. This may just be a personal thing but losing my bulk made me feel vulnerable somehow (just in my mind). When I get stronger with weights, it feels incredible. It's so stupid but there is something awesome about just being able to move a couch that I couldn't before. Carry my luggage up stairs.   e) the more muscles your body has, the more calories it burns to maintain them. In essence, being more muscular lets you burn more calories when you're doing nothing.  There is a huge wealth of information on all of the above both on reddit and on the web. Reddit also has a ton of fantastic subreddits like this one that can help give you the knowledge and support you need as you move along down this path.  I say that because you aren't just dieting. You are making a massive life change and becoming a better person. I have a feeling that this is just the start.   If you ever slip moving forward, remember that it is just a slip. You have chosen your path - get back on it. Don't switch back to an old path.  On that subject, friends, family and co-workers don't always react with support when someone changes like you are. A lot of people think that when you reject their lifestyle for your new lifestyle that you are rejecting them or looking down on them. It's like crabs in a bucket. One tries to struggle to get free but the other ones pull him back down.  Make sure you have the right people around you. The ones who support you, keep. They know that you aren't trying to be better than them - you're just trying to be better. The ones who make fun, judge, doubt - tune them out.   On that note, PM me anytime if you want to talk about any of this. I'm a big supporter of you and what you're doing.   Sorry this is 20 pages long (and sorry if any of it is useless because you already know). I got excited by your progress.  *edited for spelling"
DecidingToBeBetter,3ay554,screenwblues,3,Wed Jun 24 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"OP, listen to this advice, especially #2. If you go on such a large deficit for a period of time, your body is going to react to it in a strong (and negative) way, which more often than not, leads to binging (I've gone through this time and time again). You need 'good calories' in the forms of healthy fats and proteins to keep you not only full, but energized during the day. =)"

DecidingToBeBetter,3b02gn,Da_Mage,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:55:30 2015 UTC,"I will tell you what I did. I went to community college out of HS and totally fucked around. Essentially flunked to an abysmal level. I then took a break, and then went one county over to another community college and did things right. I didn't transfer my credits over from the first CC, so I was able to start fresh. Starting fresh is what you want to do, so I would encourage you to figure out the transfer policies of the state school you want to go to, as well as the classes that will transfer for the major you want, and go to a CC for a year (if not two).   Because you're 25, I'm guessing you aren't concerned with living on campus, so a CC's 101 classes are going to be pretty indistinguishable from a state school's. Classes will be cheaper too.  And I'm going to guess you want to play catch up because you feel like you're starting from ""behind"". Because CCs cater to working people, as well as young students, it should be easy to load up on those core classes you'll need to get out of the way before you transfer (with summer and winter sessions).   I can't speak to where you are, but I found that admissions into a 4 year state school as a transfer with good grades was pretty much automatic here in Maryland. Might be that way for where you are as well."

There's a good reason people do what you did - yo-yo diet - because they change too much at once. It isn't about a weight or 6 pack abs, its about creating a set of lifestyle habits that are healthy and sustainable for the coming decades.  Knowing that the ""diet starts tomorrow"" make you want to binge, which is a bad habit.   Start with a few small changes and make them into concrete habits that you can live with and enjoy, then build from there. Start with ""I will go for a 15 minute walk today"" to get outside, and keep it up every day for one week, then two weeks. When its normal, make it longer, or add on a jog, or something.   I'd point here for a good starting point of fixing diet in general: http://www.weightymatters.ca/2015/06/use-955-rule-to-forever-ignore-all.html and then read anything else by Dr. Freedhoff who has a very realistic and science-based approach to building and maintaining a healthy lifestyle - unsexy and no quick fix."
DecidingToBeBetter,3ayt88,midnyghtchilde,3,Wed Jun 24 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"Alright, let me share my story with you and maybe it'll give you some insight.  I'm currently 34, 5'11"" and weigh 185. When I started my weight loss journey, it was after I left law school. I was 31 and weighed in at 265; so somewhat similar stats. It's been almost 3 years to the date that I started losing the weight, so in 3 years, I've lost ~80 pounds.    Here's how I did it:  Small steps. First, I cut out all soda/sugary drinks from my diet. Except milk, I fucking love milk. But even then, I drank skim, and none of the chocolate stuff (even though I loved it). After a few months of drinking nothing other than water, tea, and milk, it became a habit.  Next came dietary changes. The biggest thing that helped me here, was using an app to track my calorie intake. Lots of people like myfitnesspal, and that's the one that I went with. I put in my (then) current weight, my goal weight, and it told me what my daily calorie intake needed to be to lose 1 pound a week. This made me realize a few things: certain foods had WAY more calories in them than I thought; and even ""healthy"" foods can be calorie dense if you're not paying attention (think salad drenched in dressing). You have to be meticulous about tracking your calories. The only secret to losing weight is calories in < calories out. Cheating the app is just cheating yourself.  After a few months of that, I decided that I wanted to start running. I got the C25K app, and started following that. 3x a week, I would go out and run. Run is a loose term, here, since I was barely able to move faster than a turtle in molasses. But that's not the point; the point is that (once again) I was building a habit. I'm not going to lie, it was hard. Probably one of the hardest things I had to do in my life. But I did it, and it's made my life so much better (more on this later).  Alright, so now fast forward to the following year. Running 3x a week and watching what I was eating helped me lose probably about 40 pounds or so, and I was floating around 220. The skinniest I had been in a long time. The second year of my three year journey was a fucking yo-yo. I was travelling all the time for work, so I was eating crap on the road, and I didn't have as much time to run -> You should read this as I DIDN'T MAKE THE TIME TO RUN. Everything you do is a choice. I was making the choice to not continue with the good habits that I had built. My weight went back and forth between 210-220 the entire year.  Third year of the journey: I got lucky. The girl that had been helping me out with my running at the local running store for the previous two years decided that I was a good enough guy to date. She's a hardcore marathon runner, and she pays exquisite attention to her diet. With her help, I renewed my commitment to running, and started keeping even closer track of what I eat. Since I started dating her in the fall, I've lost another ~40 pounds, bringing me down to 185.  So, maybe that last part was a bit out of my control, and took a bit of luck. But even then, I was the one that chose to run more; and I was the one that chose to eat better - even if it was with her encouragement.  Sorry, that got a little rambling. The main points of my story are as follows:   Losing weight is not easy. It takes time, and commitment.  The best way to go about this is to make small changes, turn them into habits, and then keep them going. Anyone can flash diet for a month or three and lose a bunch of weight; it takes real effort to keep turning down the bad food day after day for months/years on end.  One thing that I didn't mention: You can cheat. I drink beer, I eat bad stuff. Just this past weekend I gorged myself at a buddy's wedding on all sorts of food and booze. And then I woke up the next morning and ran 10K at 8 am, while partially hungover, because I understand that calories in < calories out and I had to do something about everything I had consumed the night before.  Set mini-goals for your weight loss. My first goal was to hit 240. Then 220. Then 200. Now it's 180. Once I hit 180, I'll probably set a goal of ~170, and stop there.  Don't get discouraged with minor setbacks. Every day is the first day of the rest of your life; even if the day before was a total train wreck, today is the day that you can change that.  Feel free to hit me up with messages/questions. I got a little off point in my delivery, and would be happy to clarify stuff that I glossed over.  Best of luck."
DecidingToBeBetter,3ayt88,Ashahura,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:38:12 2015 UTC,"'Losing weight' - that's a pretty big thing. Losing a lot of weight in a healthy way takes time, meaning that there will be no reward for good behavior for a long time. Not many people can do this solely on willpower, or rather, it is very hard to maintain a constant level of willpower for a very long time. So you need to break up that journey into smaller steps.  So my first suggestion would be: make a list of things that can spark that motivation. All the reasons you can think of to not want to be overweight and all the things that will improve when you are a healthy weight: visualise them, write them down, remind yourself. Don't limit it to physical stuff.  Can you team up with someone? Doing this alone when everyone around you brings in loads of unhealthy food is lonely and hard. If you can get a friend or family member to join you in a healthier lifestyle, you can motivate, challenge and support each other. Make it a competition, if that works for you.  A big goal can feel overwhelming, and if you focus on it all in one you can talk yourself into quitting before you even tried. So make smaller goals. Don't think all-or-nothing: 5 lbs lost is a great first step, even if no-one notices. Falling off the wagon does not mean you should not get up again, and it is certainly not an excuse to dig yourself in any deeper.    Forgive yourself when you fail, and start again. Think ahead about how to deal with temptations and difficult situations, so you don't have to reason with yourself on the spot when you are confronted with them."

Being truly visible is one of life's biggest challenges - unless you were lucky enough to have had a really emotionally healthy upbringing, usually from parents who had one too. :) Most of us (and our parents) have to undo some level of damage when we grow up and leave home. Are you considering any kind of therapy, at all? If you're going the self-help route, there's a great workbook for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy called ""Mind Over Mood""; available on Amazon US and UK at least. And if you've not yet seen this TED talk, you might find it helpful:   https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en  Retreating from the world can be a really healthy thing to do sometimes, working on self-esteem helps you stay immunised against negativity when you venture out again. Rejection doesn't hurt with any intensity or length of time when you feel strongly that you're basically a good person who's trying their best to live by values important to him-/herself.   Also, maybe some hobby-themed interests might help with some regular or semi-regular 'sunny' times with others? I'm not sure where you are, but meetup.com might have some local stuff going on where you can find like-minded people.

Whilst you can use a careers advice website, it is FAR better to talk to a real person. But it is ultimately YOUR choice.  2) You're only 18, assuming you still live with your parents you haven't ""fucked up"" your life.   3) We learn from our mistakes - Make sure that when you get your licence back that you drive better (I'm not trying to be a douche, I'm trying to say that you can make a bad experience into a lesson). I only realised that I need to take more care when driving because I had a collision and now have to pay for it.  4) Universities in Australia are probably OK with switching courses - it's probably easier to change courses than it is to enrol initially. (I have assumed you are in Australia because you've mentioned the double demerits system)"

The daily motions of the routine, the things we do, the goals, the ambitions, the tasks, the desires and longing for that something, that feeling of accomplishment. It's all about building up your engagement upto a moment. And when that moment is gone, so is all the excitement, tension, stress or euphoria that comes with it.  Try to worry not much. No one gives a shit how successful or full of life you want to be or will become. It should matter to you, and unless it does, you'll not enjoy the journey, which takes the better part of your 60 years.   Good luck in your endeavours, man."

DecidingToBeBetter,3avdnd,MauPow,3,Tue Jun 23 20:26:14 2015 UTC,"don't trust self anymore depression The world feels empty and like there's no place in it for me. I went to a therapist for a few weeks and all she could tell me is that I seem great and things will look up for me soon I wonder why anyone would want anything to do with me  Every decision I ever make seems like the wrong one. I look at my track record while trying to make the next decision and I lose all hope. video games   sounds like a vitamin d deficiency. try taking 4000-5000ius PER DAY along with vitamin k2 and magnesium. i can almost guarantee that it will help.  and on that note...  take a multivitamin and make sure that it uses FOLATE and NOT FOLIC ACID. if you've got adequate vitamin d levels and you still feel like shit, it's possible that you're one of the 40 percent of people who cannot convert folic acid into usable folate. in that case, the folic acid takes residence in folate receptors and actually acts as a toxin ... one of the side effects is depression.   incidentally, many foods are fortified with folic acid. if you're one of the 40 percent, you'll want to avoid these foods.  if you want to forgo multivitamins altogether, have more fresh greens for folate, onions/garlic for sulfur and cashews for copper and zinc (to boost testosterone naturally), pepitas for magnesium (for mental health, although these tend to be much more expensive and addicting than magnesium pills) and brazil nuts for selenium. i'd still supplement with 5000ius of d3 and take k2 regardless.   I go and look at the pictures and think how ugly and awkward I looked and feel terrible about myself again.   hey, it's better to know and improve than be ignorant forever. and the fact that you have friends and can pull flings and look attractive to others means that you're not all bad. not everyone photographs well.   if you're not getting attention from girls, it's likely because they're sensing that you're depressed, rather than it being some unfixable inborn trait.   stop focusing on the little shit that doesn't matter. set your eyes on the big shit that does and let that be your guiding compass.  if you make a mistake, learn from it, laugh about it and let it go. who gives a shit. no one who matters.  the most important thing to supplement with, if you're not starving, is weight bearing exercise. you've got one more year of really easy growth and i'd try to make the most of it (and even then, it's not a complete downward slide). just remember, the first set (almost) always feels like shit. the residual effects of exercise will boost your endorphins, serotonin, melatonin and growth hormone, all leading to increased feelings of wellbeing. go for compound exercises to maximize growth hormone output and make sure you exercise good form. it is vital that you execute correctly or else you will be prone to injury. at your age especially, you can no longer afford to be an amateur about fitness. it's time to get serious.   once you start feeling better, you will start to see all the opportunities you actually have. you will feel like investing in your life and investing in good experiences. don't let these good feelings trick you into sliding backwards. maintain, build and grow, always. it doesn't matter how good or bad you feel, make it into a routine. work around your injuries. keep up the passion.   you need to build an internal sense of self respect. i don't know what your situation is so i can't really help you there. it's usually flawed beliefs that keep us from respecting ourselves. in general though, if you help others, help yourself and build yourself, you will come to respect yourself. with that said, analyze your thoughts and feelings with a strict emphasis on purity of truth. if you feel bad about something and it turns out that the logic behind that feeling is unsound, then that feeling is wrong and should be abandoned. feelings affect us but they are not facts and they are not truth. they are mercurious and can blind us and we can chase the bad feelings away with logic, and lock away bad thoughts with the same.   approach your life with high awareness and ACCEPT the conditions that it gives you -but NOT the conclusions. you can reshape your life, starting with yourself and your environment. will you do it? will you stand up? i want you to STAND UP! stand proud!  there you go, that's a good start."

I just got some d3 5000 tablets, I'll start taking them and report back on any changes. I'll check my multivitamin when I get home to see if it's got folate or folic, but I do eat plenty of greens anyways (mostly kale, spinach, and broccoli).   I think you're on the right track with the vitamin issue. One of the main issues is that my mind just feels cloudy and I can't see any potential paths. I do really need to get back in the gym.

If you have a tendency to fall into negative thought/action patterns then it's time to switch it up and create a system that forces you to get out of those patterns.  It's a lot easier to change where you live than it is to change who you are (your actions and habits). A good start would be exercise and quit any wasteful habits you might have (porn, boozing etc.).   And at some point you have to pick a direction to go in. You may never find your passion in life, but if you don't pick a direction and stick with it you're going to stay in the same place. Succeeding at something you don't enjoy is better than wasting away where you are."

I will try and get back in the gym and stop wasting money on that membership :)   I have a plane ticket booked to Spain in July but I'm not sure if it's the right thing for me to do. I want to do the Camino de Santiago and then use some of my connections to get another English teaching job.

If I don't go that's $700 down the drain. My friends and family expressed to me that they didn't think it was the best idea after I told them I was rethinking it.

I remember reading something about a biological balancing in the brain; it was a study where they looked at fMRIs of people experiencing pleasure, and found that there tended to be a pain/fear/anxiety effect which followed to some degree. It may be related to that.  Ultimately, it sounds like you have an unstated belief or rule for your life: Whenever anything good happens to me, something bad will happen to me to balance it out.

DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,JamaicanGinger,10,Tue Jun 23 18:25:32 2015 UTC,"""THE DENIAL OF DEATH  BY ERNEST BECKER  ￼  What It’s About:Speaking of being afraid of dying… Here’s The Denial of Death in a nutshell:  Because man is the only animal capable of conceptualizing his own existence — thinking about his life, questioning it, imagining future possibilities — man is therefore also the only animal capable of conceptualizing his own non-existence, i.e., his own death.  In other words, humans were given the gift of being able to imagine the future and who we want to be, but the price we pay for this gift is the realization that we will one day die. A dog doesn’t realize she’s going to die. Neither does a fish. Or a roach. But we do.  This knowledge of our own inevitable death leads to a kind of ever-present “terror” that underlies everything we do. Becker argues that this terror inspires us all to take on what he calls a “hero project,” where we attempt to immortalize ourselves through our deeds and actions, to create something bigger than ourselves that will live beyond our own lives.  It’s when people’s hero projects contradict one another that we get conflict, violence, bigotry, and evil. It’s when hero projects fail that we fall into deep despair and depression because we’re once again confronted with the inevitability of our own death and meaninglessness of our lives.7  Notable Quotes:  “Man cannot endure his own littleness unless he can translate it into meaningfulness on the largest possible level.”  “The irony of man’s condition is that the deepest need is to be free of the anxiety of death and annihilation; but it is life itself which awakens it, and so we must shrink from being fully alive.”  “What does it mean to be a self-conscious animal? The idea is ludicrous, if it is not monstrous. It means to know that one is food for worms. This is the terror: to have emerged from nothing, to have a name, consciousness of self, deep inner feelings, an excruciating inner yearning for life and self-expression and with all this yet to die. It seems like a hoax, which is why one type of cultural man rebels openly against the idea of God. What kind of deity would create such a complex and fancy worm food?”  Bonus Points For: Making you contemplate your own non-existence and kind of making you feel okay about it.  If This Book Could Be Summarized in An Image, That Image Would Be:The grim reaper silently laughing to himself watching you build an elaborate Lego set called “Life,” and you turning around and saying, “Stop laughing, this is important!”  Read This Book If…  …you plan on dying one day. …you think you take life a little bit too seriously sometimes and need to chill. …you want to read a convincing argument for why we should embrace our pain and our fear rather than avoid it."""

That is bullshit. You are your greatest ally. Love yourself then maybe you can love the world.  Another thing I do to get me motivated is making promises. Problem is if I promise myself something I usually can talk my way out of it. Nowadays I promise the me of tomorrow. For some reason it makes me more motivated to do whatever it is I gotta.

DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,allsop207,6,Tue Jun 23 19:01:36 2015 UTC,"I really hope this doesn't reinforce your fear, but yes! I never articulated it out loud as such but yes! I was driving home one day from college and it was one of my best days. A lot of discipline and motivation was paying off. I was back in college after years and it was the start of my senior year. This semester my courses were really interesting and I had a great morning with my research advisor. I was getting home early and had all my work done ahead of schedule. I had exercised that morning and I had a nice relaxing day planned ahead of me...everything was so perfect. I vividly remember driving home from campus and the sun was so gorgeous and with the windows down, the breeze was slightly toasty and I consciously noticed how it all felt. My favorite artist was playing during my drive. I literally thought how perfect and brilliant everything was, and how great life was. It was more than a just a feeling, there was a warmth in these moments and a sense that life was sweeter than it had ever been. Everything was perfect.   That evening my mom called. Cancer. My whole life as I knew it was over. I had to take a medical leave of absence from school to go down to Florida and take care of her. She died within a month.   My life was shattered and no matter how good things are now, they will never ever be as sweet as the afternoon before I found out my mom had cancer. That was a little over 3 years ago and I now have the fear you describe. It's silly but I even get nervous when I hear songs from my once favorite artist that I listened to that afternoon. I drive that same strip of highway and still remember that feeling of the sun on my face and I get an eery feeling.  I've come to understand that that perfect afternoon wasn't life's way of propping me up because I would soon be devastated. In fact, my mom's cancer was there even before I applied for college and started all the great things that made that day so rewarding, we just didn't know it. In fact, if she was more proactive and disciplined about her own lifestyle and health, things may have turned out differently from early treatment or possibly prevention measures. The fear was just my brain trying to find a pattern so that I can protect myself from heartbreak again. It's almost evolutionary, right? If we are badly hurt after a behavior, we learn to avoid that behavior.  Trying to be better and improve ourselves is the most important action we can take to ensure that we prosper with regards to our health, with avoidance of accidents or unsafe situations, and if we fail to take control and just let the chips fall where they may because success may backfire on us, we are almost guaranteed to see more heartbreak and devastation than perfect days that make us feel on top of the world.  I will follow your post and see what other people have to say. I just know that the best thing for fear is to face it. There are no patterns. Some people will die after years of laziness and unmotivated living. Some will die after a life of peak success. But most of us have highs and lows with no pattern at all. The only pattern that makes a life is what we choose to do everyday."
DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,whitebean,2,Wed Jun 24 06:22:19 2015 UTC,"The fear was just my brain trying to find a pattern so that I can protect myself from heartbreak again.   This. It sums up so much. I am definitely fearing a pattern forming, like nothing good can happen without something equally bad following. So why not be safe and don't even try? Your story put a lot into perspective. Thank you so much for sharing it."
DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,allsop207,2,Tue Jun 23 20:18:12 2015 UTC,"If you want to get a little more into why this happens or how to spot it and overcome it, there's a book called What Makes Your Brain Happy and Why You Should Do The Opposite. I highly recommend it if you want to get an understanding of why we tend to hold ourselves back whenever we strive to do better. It's really interesting and you can read the first 75 pages from the amazon page (Look Inside feature) or get a sample if you have a kindle app.   edit: I just read through your other responses in this thread. I recommend this book even more. It's not that it's a life changing book or anything--not at all lol. But some of the things you've said are easily explained in this book in a way that once you know what's going on, it becomes really easy to see through and change.  For instance, right now I'm sitting here on reddit doing nothing for a good chunk of time. It feels reallllly good! I'm comfortable, I'm entertained, this is pretty damn sweet. My brain is like ""let's do more of this because it feels good, it's rewarding, and it doesn't expend energy or cause me any discomfort at all"" but if I make my brain happy, and spend hours doing this, I'll feel like crap later. I have things to take care of, chores to do, I should exercise, spend time with my pets, make that annoying phone call I don't wanna make. If I do those things, even though my brain tells me ""omg those things are not fun. those are chores. I should do them but I don't wannnnnna!"", I'll actually feel better later. I'll feel like I accomplished stuff today! I'll feel good about myself! I'll have more energy from exercising! I'll have less anxiety from getting that call over with! I'll bond with my cats and feel loved! And relaxing later tonight will be even more rewarding because I earned it and don't have to feel guilty. So in the end, my brain will be happier plus I'll have clean dishes, happy cats and a healthy body.   So right now sitting here on reddit, I know not to listen to my brain for much longer today. It's lying to me. And it's lying to you that if you get your shit together, you may die. It's just like my brain in wanting to be comfortable and not expend a lot of energy. Because getting your shit together is not comfortable. It's new, it's out of your comfort zone, it uses energy, it can cause some stress, it makes us accountable and it makes us think harder. Your brain is trying to protect you from that. It turns out it was really advantageous for our ancestors to feel like this. Expending energy meant you could die sooner if you didn't find food. Being uncomfortable probably meant you were in physical distress or hurt. Stress usually meant you couldn't find shelter, food, or a mate. So, it's not like your brain is evil or bad. It's just designed to protect us so that we survive.   Once we realize that what we hear in our head (our brain ""talk"") is a lie and it's actually safe and more rewarding and even fun to be disciplined and active, it's so much easier to just ignore it. Not sure if any of this will ring true for you, and it's fine if it doesn't fit, but I hope you find something that does work. Good luck!"

DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,CreamWafers,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"That's sweet of you to say. I've struggled with a lot of this myself.  The main thing you have going for you is that you even posted this to r/DecidingToBeBetter so you know you can do and be better than you are now. That's most of the battle right there. That proves you have the potential to change whatever isn't working for you. A lot of people go through life and never reach that point. Whether through laziness, complacency, emotional immaturity, or whatever, they never question whether they can improve themselves and even fewer people look inside themselves and figure out, like you did, what beliefs may be holding them back."
DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,StriveDrive,3,Wed Jun 24 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"""Worry is interest paid on trouble before it comes due."" - William Ralph Inge  The same can be said for fear and anxiety, which I think are very similar to worrying. Bad things will happen to you no matter what, and you will have to find a way to deal with them when they do. It is definitely not easy to have a positive outlook towards the future instead of worrying or thinking negatively about your life, health, wealth, etc. But from what I've read, if you can think positive and as a result do positive things to improve your life, many more positive things will happen in your life. For instance, these things:   1) You are more likely to attract positive things into your life by thinking positively. 2) You are more likely to take actions to actually achieve those positive thoughts or goals yourself. 3) You are more likely to be able to deal with negative situations or problems when they do happen. 4) You are more likely to find a positive solution to any of these problems that happen, whether big or small. 5) You are more likely to be a happier and more successful person, regardless of the problems in your life. 6) You are more likely to help other people and make their lives better and happier too. 7) You are more likely to live a longer and healthier life.   Negative thoughts about death, your health, or anything else are like weeds in your brain. If you don't think positively they will grow. If you plant a garden of positive thoughts, those positive thoughts will multiply and there will be no room for the negative thoughts anymore. For instance, if you think every day about living healthy and hopefully reaching the age of 80, your mind will start to think about ways to make that come true. Maybe you'll decide to learn about how often you should go to the doctor, or find a doctor who you are comfortable with, or ask a relative about how they have improved their health. Maybe you'll come up with other tasks, goals, or habits you can do in order to be healthier and improve your chances of a longer and healthier life.  One way to think positive is to write it down and read it to yourself every day. For instance, you could write down ""I will live a long and healthy life. I will take action to be as healthy as I can be. I will learn about being healthy and make it a priority in my life. I will live to be over the age of 80."" Then read that to yourself every day when you wake up and every night before you go to bed. The link below talks about goals, but it applies to any positive thoughts or making anything happen in your life.  The 7 Steps to Set and Achieve Goals"
DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,spacetimebear,2,Wed Jun 24 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"Negative thoughts about death, your health, or anything else are like weeds in your brain   I really love the way that you put that. I'm just having a difficult time getting out of the comfort of the weeds."
DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,mooducky,2,Tue Jun 23 18:36:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks. You should be proud of yourself for at least trying to get out of the weeds, and realizing that this thinking isn't good for you. I think it's great that you reached out to ask people for advice and ideas. I say keep doing that. I also like how you took the time to respond to me and lots of people. Especially when you were kind of putting yourself out there, and some people weren't particularly nice. Good for you and thanks for reading what people had to say.  Yeah it's really tough to change your thinking and it will take a lot of time and effort. But it's worth it. If you aren't going to try and make your life better and make yourself feel happier, then other people won't try to help you or do it for you. So it's up to you to plant that garden of positive thoughts so you can be happier and help other people be happier. You are in control of your life and your thoughts.  I pretty much recommend this book to anyone, but you might be interested in possibly my favorite book, called Think and Grow Rich. The part that applies to what you are talking about is a chapter called ""The Six Ghosts of Fear"". It talks about some fears that hold people back from improving their life, including a fear of death. Like other people have said, these fears are quite common. And overcoming them is key to not making excuses, and instead going after what you want in life. Conveniently for you, it's the last chapter. So if you decide to read it, you might as well read it all and have that to look forward to at the end ;)   The habit of THINKING about dying instead of making the most of LIFE, due, generally, to lack of purpose, or lack of a suitable occupation. This fear is more prevalent among the aged, but sometimes the more youthful are victims of it. The greatest of all remedies for the fear of death is a BURNING DESIRE FOR ACHIEVEMENT, backed by useful service to others. A busy person seldom has time to think about dying. He finds life too thrilling to worry about death.   Think and Grow Rich"

Remind yourself of what power you have, which choices are yours to make, and hopefully you will realise that to be more than you expected - and whatever you do choose will not affect your luck. Bad choices might bring death closer, in a cause-and-effect way, but good choices have no effect on the overhanging 'doom' that isn't really there."
DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,TheFlyingDharma,2,Tue Jun 23 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"I'm there too. But any book on manifesting your dreams mentions the alternate scenario of not just not attracting the negative in your life but also to not spend too long in the fear of losing what you already have - in your case, its 'the consequence' of your dreams you're afraid of. Have to ask yourself - would you rather try and face the consequences or not try at all?  I read an article on writer's block where the woman said she finally decided to write her book when the prospect of not writing a book at all became worse than writing a bad one.   On the flip side, you might just build the courage to deal with the possibility/reality of said freak accident while achieving your dreams ;) Gl!"
DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,Bilbowtech,2,Tue Jun 23 20:13:31 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way. You could die at any moment, at any second, from anything. A Car could come crashing through your wall. Plane crash into your house. Freak gas explosion. Aneurysm. Hearth attack. Embolism.  So don't let death be a factor in whether you do something right or not. We all die some time and there is no correlation between improving yourself and the chance you'll die."

DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,midnyghtchilde,4,Wed Jun 24 02:45:50 2015 UTC,"That's the fear talking right there. Somewhere you have a belief that says ""If things are going well for me SOMETHING is going to ruin it""  If you don't have a problems in life its called being dead. What matters is how you deal with those problems because that's where personal growth comes from.  Imagine yourself being successful at it. You are a force. You are unstoppable. Don't let your brain sabotage you...just put your head down..shoulder forward and barrel through it!   The more action you take the more momentum you'll build.   Remember this: There are no failures..only results. A failure is only a failure when we don't learn from it.   When Edison was trying to invent the light bulb there was an explosion in his lab...a friend came over and said ""So you've failed again hmm?"" Edison replied ""No I've discovered the 9999th NOT to invent the light bulb.""  ""Failure"" is a part of learning. With every great success we see what we DON'T SEE are all the failures that took place before the great success. In that case it might even be beneficial to fail often so that we can learn faster and reach our end goal quicker!  TLDR: Take your fear and Falcon Punch it in the face!"

DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,drummmergeorge,2,Tue Jun 23 14:22:08 2015 UTC,"I too have this faulty mindset.  For me it stems from two self defeating thought patterns:  1 - That it will be a waste of my time to work hard at improving myself,  if I just end up dying it will ""all be for nought"".  Why not just live out (somewhat more pathetically)  the rest of my life lazily.  I think that comes from a fear of death, and acceptance of failure.   2 - By making a decision I am limiting myself to that one decision, so make no decision at all.  (Which is of course faulty because by making no decision you have made a decision to do nothing.) This is made worse (in my situation at least) by increasingly poor health. (much of which is due to shear negligence of diet, exercise, etc.)  I recognize the problem, but I still haven't embraced it as my own philosophy."

DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,drummmergeorge,2,Tue Jun 23 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"You could call it fear of success maybe?  ""Once I succeed, I'll be faced with new, unprecedented problems.""  Rather than the problems we're used to?  Also someone else mentioned childhood conditioned - you may want to consider that your parents didn't want you to succeed too much, or at all?  That's a question only you can answer."
DecidingToBeBetter,3atac8,KazOondo,2,Wed Jun 24 06:11:43 2015 UTC,"The idea that I could die tomorrow is actually motivational for me, as like /u/ancor13 said,   I would rather die tomorrow knowing that I did everything in my power to be the best I could be, then regret the things I didn't enjoy in life because of excuses.   Even if I die tomorrow, I want to die a man of determination and drive, dammit."
DecidingToBeBetter,3axcjt,parentfolk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:49:27 2015 UTC,"I don't have the life experience you have - career success, kids etc. however I have a similar experience to you: I have grown up as a peacemaker which has made me overly sensitive to others which means that I automatically perceive even mildly negative behaviour as someone hating me and can 'sense' anger directed at me (which then causes me a great deal of stress and unhappiness) - it's funny because even when you're aware that 90% is in your own head, it still causes you stress.   While this is still an ongoing challenge for me, here are some of the things I have learned/that have helped:  Reading Stoic Philosophy such as Marcus Aurelius' Meditations - this helped me understand that life and people around us won't be perfect, but living a good life is learning to accept that while you will encounter s***ty people every day, you can still choose how you react to those things. There is no 'way of acting' that makes everyone nice to you, just acceptance that you can ultimately only control your reaction.   Mirror their behaviour if it reflects their personality - Some people who are hard to communicate with find talking to others a real challenge - often when I've got to know these people better it turns out they are actually extremely introverted people who genuinely appreciate brevity and therefore prefer to communicate on a 'cut to the chase or say nothing' basis - with these people often responding in kind fosters a mutual understanding.   Don't blame yourself - just as it can be poisonous to automatically assume they're horrible people for making you feel bad, it's also very easy to blame yourself for these situations - as a christian I often felt guilt that I should be able to turn the other cheek/empathise better with people in these situations, but ultimately you can only do your best and no more. Again this kind of goes back to acceptance of the situation.  Shake it Off - While most people have no idea they're making you feel this way, there are people out there who will just try and make you feel s*** for no reason. When this happens it's easy to play it over and over again in your mind, thinking of comebacks you could have said. While it's easier said than done, you have to make sure you don't bottle these things up, and instead let them go as soon as the moment has passed. Being very lame I do listen to Taylor Swift and dance horribly and yes it does help!  I appreciate these are somewhat vague points (I haven't totally mastered this myself), but I saw this and really empathise with this problem - remember that sensitivity like this is fundamentally a good quality and you can't change your personality, however acceptance that people aren't the same as you goes a long way to help.   Sorry I have no advice to give regarding children, but for what it's worth, my parents were strict and I went to a very strict school and without this discipline I know I never would have had the academic success I have done (it seems that strict parenting is very unfashionable, but I really respect it..)

I am trying to be that way and to not give up on my goals, but sometimes I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels.    I wish you the best and thank you for taking the time to write this article."
DecidingToBeBetter,3arfjk,Layinudown,2,Tue Jun 23 07:36:13 2015 UTC,"Thank-you so much for that really lovely comment; I so appreciate it! Especially on the writing, which I am trying hard to keep improving - you've made me very happy. :)  A couple of thoughts your reply has prompted: Yes, I am generally happy, but am not immune to sadness or stress of course; I've just built up a toolbox of how to handle it all. I'd a lifetime of poor self esteem and bouts of melancholy, before I studied how to be happy/emotionally strong. Like anyone else tho', if I'm underslept or sick it takes more effort to manage! :) That's when you need your bag of tricks most. (Sunday just past I had a dip in my mojo, started ruminating a bit and dwelling on some negatives - then realised I was doing it, and that it was because I was just over-tired from travel the day before. Spent time with a close friend and his daughter, then met some old/new friends and took in a gig - I was much happier at the end of the day than the start. :) )  As to knowing why you want to do things - there are a few approaches that work, if you'd like to play around with these:   Look for clues in childhood of the kinds of things you lost track of time doing - writing, building, exploring, singing, playing sport. How much of these kinds of things do you do now, either in your work or your hobbies? Try automatic writing - pen to paper/fingers to keyboard, write without pausing for a couple of pages. Gibberish will come out at the start, as you'll probably be feeling self-conscious and resisting the process, but just type some nonsense and keep going. Great ideas, truths and insights emerge, because you're typing/writing too fast for the conscious editor to tell the same old stories we all tell about ourselves. It's like panning for gold - doesn't matter about the muck if there are a few nuggets in there! :) If you find yourself worrying about doing the ""wrong"" thing, remember you're a human making the best decision you can with imperfect information, in any given moment. There are many ways to live your life, many careers or hobbies you could try - there's no ""right"" or ""wrong"" thing to do, just healthier and more meaningful ways to do it. Go back to your values - what matters to you as a person; what kind of person is it important for you to be? What kinds of activities would that person thrive at? For me, deciding which adventure to go after is based a lot on who I am, and who I'm becoming, and how good of a match the opportunity it is. (Now I'm in a committed relationship, we do that together - we make joint decisions based on both of our needs, and whose is greater at that stage of life/career.) I wrote this short post about ""self"" - and actually, it's one of a free series of posts called ""10 Weeks to Wellbeing"" that covers career, hobbies, education etc. - that might help? It starts here   I so remember the wheel-spinning feeling. The original article above starts after I'd stayed in a job that I felt trapped in for too long, got depression, fell apart, rebuilt myself and found some real purpose. Only then did the real forward motion start. :)   I hope some of that helps spark some ideas - feel free to PM me if you've further thoughts or questions about any of it! Thanks again for your comment, and have a lovely day!"

Most of the time you won't even realize that you have lied until much later. That's okay, but write them all down and why it is wrong to lie with every single one. The more aware you are of your lying, the more likely you'll be able to catch yourself before it happens. The reason you're like this is probably because you were raised in an environment where it was advantageous and easy to lie, so it will be hard to reprogram your thought process, but once you start becoming more aware of your thoughts you can control them better to not lie."

You could be spending that time applying for jobs, organizing your life, working or even just exercising to relieve some stress.   Here are my suggestions:   You have a bit of time before you graduate. If you haven't taken your resume to a writing center on campus, do that. Once your resume is in top shape (or if you've already done that), KEEP APPLYING TO JOBS. As many as possible, FT/PT, near far, things in and out of your field.   If you're living at home where is your money going? Make a budget - stick to it. Save as much money as possible, just in case.   What are you and your girlfriend fighting about? Weekly screaming matches are alarming. Perhaps there is a communication issue. Try listening to her, her issues and see if you can understand where her side of the hostility is coming from. I'm assuming a lot of your hostility towards her is stress related? Let her know you need support over the next few months - try to be as clear as possible about your physical and emotional needs with her.   Also, it would be worth having a conversation with your parents asking them if they can help you relocate if they move before you are in a position to leave as well. I don't want to assume, but I'd like to think your parents won't leave you homeless.  Everything seems really terrible right now, but you can get through this. It will be tough, but if you hit this head on I think you will come out on top."

Keep applying, keep reading up on interview techniques (e.g always have a watch and be the person that is always watching the time while on assessment days). Keep networking, update your linkedin all the time, keep sending out your CV and if it is rejected (if they reply) ask for feedback on why, always read up on a companies values etc when applying - have a basic template of a cover letter that you alter each time.   Learn how to de-stress, it doesn't help anything in anyway. meditate, go for a walk for 20 minutes each day, cut out caffine and sugar, go for a run. Just do something that isn't on technology and can allow you to think clearly."
DecidingToBeBetter,3atp4s,opssc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"What nobody ever tells you about job hunting is that sending out a million resumes and applications and getting absolutely no reply from anyone for weeks or months at a time is a normal part of the process.  It doesn't mean that you're never going to get a job.  It just takes a long time sometimes.  You get nothing for weeks, and then you get a call for an interview.  You go on a few interviews, and get passed over.  It seems completely hopeless.  And then you get a job.  And suddenly your life is spontaneously moving in the right direction again.  It's a terrifying, nerve-wracking process, and it completely sucks.  But the sucking isn't a bad sign?  Sorry, I realize that probably doesn't make you feel much better.  But I find it helpful to remember when I'm job-hunting.    As for short-term money, get another credit card (for emergencies, and to build your credit).  And start doing odd jobs - babysitting, yard work, etc.  Get a little cushion.    Talk to your parents.  If they're letting you live with them, they care about your well-being enough not to just throw you to the wolves without a dollar in your pocket the second their house sells.  Sit down with them and ask them to help you come up with a solid plan.    It'll be okay.  Major life transitions are insanely stressful, and everyone weirdly acts like positive life transitions don't count.  Like, it's ""okay"" for death, divorce, illness, etc. to be stressful, but things like marriage, graduation, a new job, etc. shouldn't be.  Change and upheaval are chaotic and scary.  It's completely normal to be terrified when you're graduating without a job.  But it's not the end of the world.  You'll be fine.  Hang in there."

DecidingToBeBetter,3ap1qb,red570,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:18:01 2015 UTC,"Hi there, here are my thoughts, as a coach:  Question 1: The way you've phrased this is key. It puts the pressure on you to ""get it right"" and the power to influence your feelings on the person talking to you. Try focusing less on ""interpreting what people say accurately""; decide not to take it seriously regardless of how they mean it. People's intentions are tied up with their stories; freedom comes from choosing to react how you want to react regardless of what they say or do.  This is of course tangled up with...  Question 2: Situations are only negative if you intepret them as negative. I had severe depression when I was in my late 20s and it was hellish at times, but also a source of great meaning and depth as I broke myself down and rebuilt myself. I'm now incredibly grateful for that period. The thing about things ""getting to you"" is - things only get to you if they trigger/mirror stuff already going on inside you. If you feel negative about a situation or a person, it's an opportunity to look inside and ask ""what is going on with me that that stung"". I'm sure you've lots of highs from your recent self-work, where you felt so good about yourself that ""negative situations"" seemed insignificant, or more temporary, or funnier or whatever? Re-focus away from the external situation/other person and back onto what you can do to feel better about yourself.  Question 3: Try automatic writing - writing (or typing, which I prefer 'cos I can go faster!) without pause. Start with the question ""Why am I not applying for jobs?"" and the answer - garbage will come out, because you'll be trying to edit yourself but you're not allowed to pause for even a second! That way you go too fast for the inner edit/bullsh*tter to do its normal distract/cover-up/make excuses work that it does so well for self-preservation reasons. You might also try volunteering, or even reading volunteer stories. Find stories of people who really LOVE what they do - whether they have an enjoyable part-time job that frees them up (time-wise and money-wise) to pursue a hobby, a full-time job that they feel capable and confident in, a long-term career that they're patiently working towards... Feed your mind with positive stories about the areas you feel stuck in.   And as someone who has always been a huge fan of self development, who works in it full-time, writes about it all the time... take a break from it some times. :) Too much introspection can give your brain too much to do, particularly during sleep (sorting out the mental to-do list of thoughts and worries of the day); go for hands-on, physical stuff, distraction with comedy and music that makes you feel good, cookery, whatever. Try a new skill just for the craic - I've got some playlists of art and music tutorials - and meditations, which may help you too - at http://soulambition.com/tv.  You've proved to yourself you can grow and improve (we all can, sometimes we just need to remind ourselves); keep learning, and keep playing!"

Getting coffee is a good one, I think, because people at coffee shops tend to be a little chatty. Try giving a stranger a genuine compliment. This helped me, because I saw that when I did, nothing bad happened. Sometimes I would get a funny look or something, but it really didn't matter. Nothing bad actually happened. Force yourself to do it. See that nothing bad happens. Go to a town you've never been to and will never go to again. Talk to someone, embarrass yourself, say something stupid, and it doesn't matter, because you'll never see the person again. Practice."

Once you realize that even if you look like a fool, the world doesn't end and you CAN stand it, your social anxiety largely melts away...we had a list of mildly embarrassing to pretty Damon embarrassing tasks to try--asking complete strangers for bus fare, walking into a diner, coffee shop, etc., asking for tap water for free, drinking it, saying thank you and leaving without buying anything else, asking a stranger or a casual acquaintance for a small favor, stuff like that... I can't think of any other examples off of the to of my head, but if people are interested, I will find the whole list. This really, really helped me...and you CAN go even more extreme...walk out in public one day dressed as super hero, stand on a busy street corner and shout ""I am a loser"" ten times at the top of your lungs. People will look at you funny, laugh, smirk, but when you feel the humiliation and do it anyway, you will be proud of yourself, and your confidence and an attitude of not giving a fuck how others judge you will grow. The idea is to desensitized yourself to embarrassment and build confidence, that is some extreme embarrassment potential, but when the world doesn't end, you will have a massive influx of confidence. It is hard. It is daunting, and you will be nervous and red-faced and want to crawl under a rock, but when you make it through and it isn't as world-crushing as you built it up in your  mind, believe me, you will become much more relaxed and socially ""loose""."

Just try to get yourself out of a bad place, it might be applying for a 7 jobs in a week (apply for jobs in the field your interested in, even if you don't think your qualified do it anyway). Keep going to community college classes and keep volunteering, it all goes on a resume which employers see as being proactive and not lazy, which are highly employable qualities. It may take months or years but whatever you do keep moving forward. We are all sharks, we drown if we stop moving forward (sorry if I'm getting preachy)"

Hell 25 is when a a lot people just begin to know what they want to do with their life. It certainly isn't old neither. Old enough to know something but still young enough to learn a lot.  Okay so yeah there are some 25 year olds who are doing very well off but there are twice as many 35+ year olds who are finally ""getting it"". Don't put too much emphasis on age, set your own pace. Down worry about the guy down the street, chances are that life just rolled better numbers for him.  Make goals and work to achieve them. Don't worry if its ""too late""."

Its all bullshit because there are far more stories about people who have turned their lives around at ages far older than 25.

Now I'm 32 and I just started a job as a bus driver and I'm enjoying that despite not using any of my schooling. And chances are I'll change careers down the line again as most people do. But that's ok.  Never ever too late to make a positive change in your life! Just keep volunteering and trying to find your passion. Don't feel bad if you hit road bumps or if you want something different later in life. There are always people older than you with less of a clue what they want to do with their life, and some people never find their ""thing"" but have a great life regardless."

When I leave, I'm moving to a location I've always wanted to live in and working an online job to make ends meet. I promised myself 6 months of this ""limbo"" before I fully commit to any direction.

DecidingToBeBetter,3ajp1w,TunaFace2000,2,Sun Jun 21 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"I suggest setting a time limit on feeling sorry for yourself (as you stated below).  Start making a list of pros and cons about various fields of interest and see what bubbles up from that.  Take it from an old-timer your jobs, occupation or fields of interest may change many times in your life.  Try to pick a field that has crossover value to other fields.  If you liked being with patients but not the gory, front-line of EMT duties, what is it about patient contact you liked?     As a volunteer maybe it was cheering people up or speaking with them and encouraging them in their recovery.  If you stay in healthcare what about becoming a therapist or social worker or OT?  You're still young and this is a huge disappointment.  You probably didn't expect this and it's knocked you around, as life does.  You'll come out the other side of this and life will be good again.

Try volunteering somewhere you've never thought of before, you may end up liking it. If you don't, you're only loosing a little time doing something beneficial for/to others. I'm halfway through a masters degree in criminal justice and I realized as much as I liked it, my marketability for that field wouldn't have been much better than when I had started so I just jumped shift for technical school for hvac this fall. I've had two jobs in customer service since graduating college and starting grad school to pay my way through grad school. I did not enjoy the customer/employee interaction day in/out but I learned to work with my hands in both jobs and I found out that I really enjoy it so I started looking for jobs that allowed me to do that and after some searching and talking to people, I decided on hvac. I'm 24 about to be 25 so I can relate to where you're coming from. Like Dory from Finding Nemo says ""just keep swimming"".

You're essentially trying to shame and guilt yourself into doing things like some school principle or DARE cop visiting school.  Speak to yourself with respect, and come up with solutions--actions that you can take, that help you move forward (""I will take those classes I always wanted to."" instead of ""I should take those classes I always wanted to."").  Logically speaking the comparisons, and the ""should"" don't work.  You're comparing yourself to people whom could have a really shitty life in every other respect except how they present themselves on Facebook.  You don't know what that person is like or feels like when no one is around.  As for the comparisons, I bet if/when you had seen Michael Jackson on TV in the late 70s ealy 80s, you would've thought ""Wow, that guy has everything going for him.""  and how wrong you would have been.

DecidingToBeBetter,3ak39d,jdizzle000,13,Sun Jun 21 01:31:31 2015 UTC,"Old lady here (well, Internet old): 20 years ago, when I got engaged, from the outside and on a spreadsheet, I married down. My father was a corporate attorney, my mother was the daughter of a judge, and we have family silver that goes back generations, if you catch my drift. My fiancé was an art major college drop-out, from divorced working class parents, who had a brother that had kids out of wedlock and a mom making minimum wage and just scraping by.   I. Married. Up. My life has been great, not because I pair-bonded with the flashiest peacock, but because I married a man who has integrity and loyalty and courage. He has become very successful in his career. His side of the family do struggle with money, but they are warm and loving and funny and kind. My father's family is mostly dead now, as he is, but there were few loving words spoken between them that didn't have ulterior motives. That family was a bunch of toxic assholes. If I had married into a similar family, I would likely be divorced now, as many of my country club friends are, or just miserable in a golf and scotch hell.   I guess what I'm saying is: don't focus on becoming something fancy to attract a mate. You'll wind up with a woman who only cares for status. Focus on being something worthy instead. Work hard to pursue the crafts that interest you, and do whatever you do with integrity and self-respect.   And lay off the red pill crap. See women as people. We aren't puzzle boxes that you can unlock for sex. Just be real. And maybe read Paddle Your Own Canoe by Nick Offerman (aka Ron Swanson) if you want guidance on becoming an authentic man."

Work hard to pursue the crafts that interest you, and do whatever you do with integrity and self-respect    Ah, that's the catch-22. At present if I had the liberty to do so I'd likely only aspire to go on Netflix binges. The fear of being rejected by a massive portion of society for 'low social status is therefore a great motivator. However at the same time it's stressful to the point I lose sleep over it, hours dwelling over it, or occasionally have panic attacks.   On the next rung up I suppose I am helping vulnerable children with their future education and self esteem, but that's for a bare minimum of hours.   lay off the red pill crap. See women as people. We aren't puzzle boxes that you can unlock for sex. Just be real    That's the thing, I'm not particularly bothered about not having sex, except for the fact that my virginity seems to be held against me; ""look, this guy's managed to come out uni a virgin, there must be something defective with him, stay away!""   I suppose it'd be different if I was still hard-line religious or conservative…but I'm not. I'm relatively liberal. I don't avoid the pursuit of sex like a plague, I just sense that it's also a red herring, some sort of menial short-cut to happiness and success which won't fulfil me if I get it too soon, under the wrong conditions.

I think you'll cringe when you look back on your RP time. Quit it and go with positive communities such as this one and r/GetDisciplined.  Be the person you'd find attractive, not what society thinks is attractive. Do you like good looking people? Put time into your appearance. Go to the gym, start going to stores and try on clothes to get a sense of how fashion works, you don't even have to buy any there and then, whatever. Do you like people who've become something in their field and helped change the world? Reflect on what interests you, start reading about it. Get biographies of succesful people and read them. Make sure you read those of women too to balance out the RP crap. Don't like that you go on Netflix binges? Go to the library instead and read inspirational books. Or watch inspirational documentaries. On Netlfix if you must. Chef's Table is great.  I used to be quite lonely, but I found my group of weirdos through sites like OkCupid and we rock together. All of us were social outcasts in high school, many virgins until quite late. We now follow our interests and are building up careers, doing what we like and supporting eachother in our endeavours. There's males, females and everyone in between. We respect eachother. Sure there are tensions and jealousy but we talk about it, reflect on ourselves and learn from our mistakes.  Yes, life is a dirty game. Social relations are a huge backstabbing mess. Succesful people manipulate and play dirty all the time. All that does not mean you have that kind of person, because people like genuinely good people better.

DecidingToBeBetter,3ak39d,sniffpetrol,2,Tue Jun 23 12:07:21 2015 UTC,"Well the character Ron Swanson is, but the man Nick Offerman is a traditional alpha but in no way an ""Entourage alpha"" if you know what I mean. So substance above style, real friendship over ritzy flash, cabins instead of cars, and partnership with a good woman rather than flings with interchangeable arm candy.   Nick is like his character Ron in that he strongly recommends making things and conducting your life with integrity. Nick is a woodworker and outdoorsman, and he thinks that most people would benefit from disconnecting from media and electronics on a regular basis. Since you have Netflix, watch his comedy special American Ham to see if his approach to life is one you can incorporate into your own.   As for Netflix and reddit and games and Facebook--all these things are designed to keep us face-to-screen. Like pizza and ice cream, or alcohol and weed, they have a place in life but they have to be managed or else they manage us. So just like eating right, exercising and getting good sleep, limiting screen time is a matter of developing a better habit.   And finally, there are many beautiful and kind women in the world who will be extremely attracted to a man who gives himself to improve the lives of vulnerable children. Those women may not be easy to see, but they exist. They are wondering if they aren't good enough, too."
DecidingToBeBetter,3ak39d,sniffpetrol,5,Mon Jul 6 01:07:48 2015 UTC,"Short story here I hope it helps you: I am in my 40's and have kind of floated through life, I have a career but never really had the ambition to go big with it. I am getting farther behind my peer group as time goes by. For many years I have been jealous of one old schoolmate of mine who was always posting his latest and greatest professional accomplishment on FB. He does work for big name performers and rock stars etc. I met up with him a few years ago only to find out that he was addicted to drugs, and having an affair that his wife found out about and almost caused a divorce. His personal life was a total mess. He was actually pretty miserable. He recently started 12-step and began turning his life around .... but my takeaway from it is that you cannot judge the quality of a person's life by their FB posts or their accomplishments."

DecidingToBeBetter,3ak39d,Calimhero,2,Sun Jun 21 14:09:05 2015 UTC,"The few comments so far that say stop comparing yourself to others on facebook are spot-on, so I'm not gonna repeat it. Sounds like you already know how detrimental it is, but refuse to stop using it to compare your life to others. Only person who's gonna make it stop is you, bucko. So fucking stop. It's really that simple.   As for TRP, you ought to stop hanging on their every word. I'm not about to tear them apart like so much of reddit already does because I believe they have something valuable to offer in terms of making men aware of how women operate and how to overcome your baser instincts and social conditioning to become the best version of yourself. However, there's still a considerable amount of vitriol and anti-feminist noise that gets spewed around by those still stuck in the anger phase who refuse to move on and be productive. So you've really gotta wade through some shit to find something worth reading.  By all means, learn game, learn what women respond to and what their biological imperative is in life, but do it in order to be better than the imperative. Don't stay angry towards women for what they are, it's just the way it is. Learn in order to become a better man, not because you hope it'll net you bitches or because you hope it'll change the fact women are designed to look for excitement early in their lives, then the most stable, suitable reproductively-capable mate when they get older. Sure, you might get more ass in being a better man, but it's a side effect, not the goal. And no, you're not going to be a movie star or a rock god overnight, nor should you. Quit stressing about the big picture and how all the pieces are supposed to fit and just work on one piece at a time. Quit trying to make sense out of nonsense.  Set a small goal and work towards that goal. Then set a larger goal and put in the work. Lather, rinse, repeat on a steady incline. See, the thing about being interesting and credible is the fact you're working towards it. You may or may not ever get there, but when you have the motivation to actually try and manage to follow through on that, it speaks volumes of your character. And that's what people see.   So abandon all notions of keeping up with the Joneses and work on bettering yourself for no other reason than making yourself feel better. When you compare yourself to others, you're effectively writing a movie titled ""My Big Ego"" with a subtitle of "": I'll Never Be Good Enough."" Get rid of your ego. You have to be able to look into yourself, see your flaws, feel the insecurity of what you find lacking in your life, but master the emotions that they don't get the better of you. If it keeps happening, your ego is still too big. When you can look into yourself find what's ""broken"" and set out to fix it without giving a fuck about what others think, you're on the right track.  This is coming from experience, not just talking out of my ass. I've been through the cycles of insecurity, fear, depression and self-loathing. I allowed myself to feel those emotions, then pushed them to the side. I even sat down and wrote out my budget, my debts (which is where most of my stress comes from), my interests, my personal beliefs and my goals. Simply writing it all out to streamline the cloud of uncertain thoughts swirling in my head made things easier to handle. I work two jobs now, have finally gotten over my ex, am going to see my favorite band play for the 4th time in a few days, just recently enrolled in a community college after a decade of dead-end jobs since high school and have a goal set to go to Burning Man for the first time next year. I'm still not where I want to be because one of my two jobs pays dick, I have a 3-year-old son to provide for who I don't see as often as I'd like and I struggle with existential concepts. To name a couple, how my son and I would handle me moving a far enough distance away that he rarely sees me in person and how I'm supposed to make a living trapped in a rat race small town full of conservative, religious people when all I want to do is sell everything I own, pack what I can carry on my back and go travel/hike/camp away from my problems. But it's getting better because I'm accepting who I am, forgiving myself for who I am not and am putting in the work to achieve the goals I set in terms of who I want to be and how to fulfill what'll make me happy.   Nobody's gonna put in the work except you. Nobody is gonna give a fuck if you fail. So start putting in the work. Have other things to do that prevent you from sitting around the house trapped inside your own head. Oh, and if you haven't already, download the Black Phillip Show podcasts and listen to them all, then listen to the Beige Phillip Show episodes from the beginning."

DecidingToBeBetter,3ail5u,an0therFate,2,Sat Jun 20 15:23:32 2015 UTC,"I have a few pieces of advice for you.  Maybe they will apply and maybe they won't.  First, smile when you speak, not a huge grin or anything, just a small smile.  The person to whom you're speaking will smile back, and if you can get her smiling, she will associate you with smiling.    Next, have fun!  I used to put alot of pressure on myself, and treated first dates like job interviews.  Have fun, relax, enjoy yourself.  Force yourself to go outside of your comfort zone, but have fun doing it.  If a girl rejects you, look at it like her loss, and go talk to someone else.    As someone else said, workout.  Not cardio.  Pick things up and put them down; over and over again.    Eat tons of protein, lay off the sugar.  At your age, you have the ability to put on muscle like a motherfucker.  Chicks dig muscles."

DecidingToBeBetter,3ail5u,Xemnas81,2,Sun Jun 21 04:16:54 2015 UTC,"My friend, who I saw as an absolute player until he spilled his guts out last night, told me something. He said don't worry about it. Sex is not as big a thing as the media makes it out to be. Nor are relationships.  Your life does not magically end up happily ever after at the end of the orgasm. Sex alone won't make you happy, or even confident. That comes from within. Or at very least it comes from setting goals and reaching them, making decisions and sticking by them.   I really don't think getting laid is the solution to your self esteem dude. I know you think it is, but long-term, it isn't.   As for 'someone, anyone'…put yourself in the shoes of someone else hearing this. Would you be happy knowing that they're only with you because they could get no-one else? Wouldn't you rather wait for someone who could tell you you blow their world up and you know them like the back of your hand? Finding a soulmate is a paradox, again my friend said. They only come when you're relaxed about not having one, and generally content with your life.   Positive energies man."
DecidingToBeBetter,3ail5u,Xemnas81,3,Sun Jun 21 04:25:02 2015 UTC,"First off, exercise. And do please include cardio, it's more likely to give you a natural high (good against negative thoughts) and also reduces bodyfat, for that lean look.   Build confidence. Several ways to do that. Easiest is to get really good at something, doesn't matter what it is. Mastery comes the same in all things. Socialising with strangers is also great, even if it's just an extra sentence at the store checkout. The first step is half the battle. You can also increase your confidence by decreasing the fear of failure. Only way to do that is to fail, and fail many many many times. Purposely embarrass yourself in situations with little long-term consequence, but high short-term shame. It will desensitize you. It's not as bad failing as you think. Actually it might grow on you, because every failure inescapably becomes a life lesson.   With girls it might take some effort, but it's almost impossible to not get there if you give your all. Ditch the fatalistic attitude, girls avoid it like the plague. Don't try to get laid, it's off-putting. Just be genuinely interested in her life. The best way to get the girl is to make her think that you're not like 'other guys'. Every girl has a whole warehouse of bad experiences with men. Find out what has sucked and be the opposite of that. Don't get friendzoned. Maybe start with lower grade women to get the ball rolling.   If you're not naturally attractive, you've got to put some effort into it. Every girl spends hours every morning to just look average. Don't wear childish shit. No superhero stuff, no T-shirts with random texts. Get some nice business casual cotton shirts and roll up the sleeves. The dirty secret to male fashion is finding the perfect fit. Google how you can determine yours. If you worry you lack a fashion sense, find a gay guy or a female relative to help you out.   It's natural to get depressed if life isn't going that super. Don't worry about it. It always gets better. One step at a time, as always. Try being a little bit less lazy and out of the comfort zone every day. Always be cleaning and improving your habitat, it's like a free boost to morale.   Read books. Good, challenging books. And lots of them. There are many qualities that will get you girls, such as looks, humour, confidence, flirtiness, but there's always intelligence. It's right up there with confidence. A smart woman knows that a smart man is worth way more than a strong or attractive one. Also, self-help books. Everybody shits on them, but there's a great many truths in them and the upbeatiness of their style can really help you out of the slump.  Then there's sex. You need to prepare yourself for when you get lucky. You don't want your first experience to be a disaster, as that may become a mental burden on your further self-confidence. Porn won't help you. Concentrate on her. Gentle, caressing, all that stuff. It will feel good emotionally for you too. Then rougher at the end.   Get cracking, mate."
DecidingToBeBetter,3ail5u,ezra_navarro,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:08:25 2015 UTC,"Accept it. You're never having sex with a girl of your liking.  I've just accepted it. Not everyone in this life gets everything. For me, it's consensual sex with a girl of my liking, while being romantically involved. It is just not going to happen.  I've been rejected so many times, I've literally deeply accepted it as a fact that I am not ever going to have sex or a girl friend or love or any such shit.  I wake up, eat breakfast, shower, goto work, come back, watch some TV shows, surf reddit, browse some porn occasionally a couple times a week, and then I goto sleep, then rinse and repeat. Occasionally I goto the movies alone, because, I have no friends left who'd come join me for a get together or a movie. And because I'm tired calling everyone up to meet them, and then still getting turned down because they had ""some personal stuff"" to ""take care of urgently"".  I'm not saying I've completely lost hope. I am reading some books on how to approach women, watched a lot of YT videos on that, but still, at the end of the day, with no energy left, only one thought comes to mind which floods out all these thoughts of loneliness and being single and not having sex - it's alright, I'm gonna die one day, it's all pointless to long after such silly things. Sex probably won't be that great big of a deal. Masturbation is still better. Intimacy with someone - well, can't force it unless the love is reciprocated. Can't just kidnap someone and force them to love me.  Friends - fuck 'em. Friends who don't ever try to put in the least bit of effort to hang out with you - they're not your friends.  Loneliness - Just keep yourself busy. Don't let these thoughts stay in your mind for long. Always try to hop onto some activity that will keep you engaged. I engage in gaming, reading some self help books/novels/newspaper/food recipes, programming my side projects, learning German, and surfing reddit.  Seriously, the TL;DR is this: It doesn't matter that you haven't had sex yet, don't have a gf, or whatever. If you're not feeling adequate without these unfulfilled desires, you'd never be adequate with them too. Learn to be content from inside. Douse out desires that aren't an absolute need.  Take care."

DecidingToBeBetter,3afd33,somaganjika,71,Fri Jun 19 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"When I was living in San Francisco, I was walking down the street with my sister and there was an old man just leaning on a wall.  Just as we passed him he very quietly said, ""please help.""  We weren't sure if we heard him right, so we turned back and asked him if he was ok.  Turns out he is blind as a bat and barely mobile, and he pretty much only ever left his house to walk a few blocks to the mailbox to mail his bill payments.  His name was Robert.  Every time he leaves, he stands at the wall outside his house and quietly asks for help until someone stops.  He told me it usually takes a pretty long time for anyone to stop. :(  So my sister and I each took an arm, and walked him to the mailbox, double checked his addresses on his letters for him, and then walked him home.  After that, whenever I walked through the neighborhood and I saw him I would just go up and say, ""hi Robert, let's go to the mailbox.""  He would grab my arm, and off we would go, him telling me stories of his wife who had passed several years earlier.  He was a very sweet man, and I'm grateful for the opportunity I had to help him and learn some of his story.  After a couple years, I stopped seeing him around anymore.

Edit- just to clarify, I'm not talking about his mailbox, I'm talking about the drop off only mailbox a couple blocks away in front of the post office.

DecidingToBeBetter,3abwg9,MuseCo,8,Thu Jun 18 21:08:46 2015 UTC,Thank you for posting this!!
DecidingToBeBetter,3abwg9,apoctapus,3,Fri Jun 19 01:12:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I wrote this a while ago and stuck it in my diary and forgot about it. Then I figured I might as well share it with people. So I'm really gratified to get a positive response.   If you'd like to share, I'd be curious what thoughts it brought up for you.   I wrote it in response my own mistakes--everything I did wrong and why I delayed for so long in getting to where I am now. For example, I did take a career aptitude test in high school, and my highest score was musician. I was required to write a response to the test results, and I wrote a scathing, angry rant about how that was a ridiculous result and I could never be a musician. I ended up selecting the third choice career instead. (Someone said something about my singing that wounded my ego when I was around 10.)   Now, many years later, I'm working on being a musician and I'm finally happy. I may never ""succeed,"" but I'm no longer listless and bored all the time. So I know how easy it is to get derailed from your path.   I watched my dad, after being ""born too early"" to study computer science in school, teach himself several programming languages when personal computers started becoming available. He was constantly working on algorithms and programs, but he never shared what he was working on with anyone who knew anything or could offer criticism/guidance/advice. He never got a job in the field because he had no degree and didn't know how to market himself. He always said he was ""on the verge"" of a breakthrough, to the point where I stopped asking him about it. He died last year.   So don't think it won't happen to you. You have to take risks, you have to work really hard, and you have to push yourself to do real things in the real world. Communicate with people. Test your beliefs. Don't die with your music still in you."
DecidingToBeBetter,3aa7bh,everest8612,67,Thu Jun 18 13:26:54 2015 UTC,"Read ""The Power of Now"". There's some spiritual mumbo-jumbo to sift through, but the principles layed out are good.   The gist is that people too often let their minds live in the past or the future, which are not real. The only actual state is the present, but you're so consumed by thoughts of where you were or where you want to be that you fail to appreciate it. The book lays out a blueprint for shifting yourself away from the past and into the present.  EDIT: Here's a PDF. I definitely recommend a hard copy though."

DecidingToBeBetter,3aa7bh,ya_tu_sabes,5,Thu Jun 18 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"Great stuff ! Also (probably covered by the book), being self forgiving. When you're calm and feel ready for the exercise,  picture your past younger self as a separate person. See the emotional scars and pain and fear that lead to these now cringey decisions. You can even represent these internal things as physical. Ragged clothes or bloody bruises. Reach out to your own empathy to find it in your heart to be compassionate to past self and learn to forgive him/her. I practiced this exercise with a mirror to help the mental imagery.  This might take several sessions. It can be confronting.   Once you're comfortable with that part, you can transfer it to everyday by stopping shame filled thoughts as they appear in your mind and replace them with a more positive atitud towards yourself"

DecidingToBeBetter,3aa7bh,CentralCalBrewer,5,Thu Jun 18 15:07:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, in fact I realized that my mind has developed  a self defence mechanism to keep me from dwelling on those thoughts, where I blurt out something random when one of those thoughts begins to surface as a means of diversion.  ButI've learned that trying to suppress memories of my past is not going to help me grow beynd it, so now when it happens I make a conscious effort to observe the memory, let it pass, and then observe how that memory makes me feel, and let it pass. Punishing yourself now for things that you did in a different mental state at a different time years ago isn't going to help you transfrom into who you to be, and so for the sake of your mental environment I would suggest you learn to forgive yourself."

I found both to be thought-provokingly introspective which is a major aspect of what a true self help book attempts to do.   ""The Way of Kings"" by Brandon Sanderson has 3 very down on their luck in a real bad way characters who have to make tough calls slogging through a lot of shit in an epic fantasy style novel.

DecidingToBeBetter,3a6ef7,cwdoogie,140,Wed Jun 17 18:36:38 2015 UTC,"Your story reminds me very much of my own.  At 26 years old, I was a hopeless alcoholic living in my mother's basement, totally broke, no girlfriend, no real friends to speak of, no job, and hardly anything to live for.  At 30 years old, I have been sober for 4 years, live in a $400K home that is 2/3 paid off, am in my dream job and have plenty of friends and an awesome social life.  How did that happen? Where did it start to turn around?  First and foremost, you need to identify where your biggest obstacles and distractions are. For me, this was a combination of spending too much time by myself at home, smoking and drinking, and spending WAYYYY too much time on social media (mainly Facebook games). I cut ALL of that out immediately, and if I'm being completely honest, it wasn't just the hardest thing I've ever done... it's likely the hardest thing I'll do in my entire life. Physically, it nearly killed me. Mentally and emotionally, it was indescribably difficult.  Hindsight, however, is 20/20... and being on the other side of it, I cannot begin to express how much my current self (your future self) is grateful (will be grateful) for the effort expended.  Ultimately you must decide, here and now, what you want your life to look like at 30... at 35... at 40... 50... and so on. You say you lack self-confidence, and my response is that you must force yourself to be uncomfortable for however long it takes to become the person that your awesome future self will be. I guarantee you that whatever physical, mental and emotional pain you endure will not match the fevers, chills, shakes, vomiting blood and wanting to kill myself every day that I endured in the first month of getting sober. Remember that you are blessed with the gift of life and the will to make a post like this: a first step in the journey that will take you to greatness.  Start by making a list of things that represent the best version of yourself. How will he look and act? How does he feel? Where does he work and who does he associate with? What is his daily schedule? How does he carry himself? These are the questions you must first answer as you begin to sculpt a mold in which your essence will be poured over the coming months and years.  Life is not an open-and-shut concept that is entirely self-contained. It's a process that evolves every day you're living it, with you in the center and the rest of your universe being created every second around you. When you begin to realize that you have control over ALL of it: every interaction, every second, every choice in your life, you will begin to see the results of that control manifest into reality.  I had to do a lot of things to get what I wanted, and most of them happened in the first year after I made the choice to be a better person. First, I had to make the choice and identify what I wanted. That's where you're at now. The next steps are unique to each person, but I'll tell you what I had to do so you have an idea of the level of effort required.  After making the choice to become a better person, I quit smoking and drinking within 3 months. This was by far the hardest part for me, and reaped the greatest rewards. You might need to quit something easier, like habits of self-pity or feelings of mediocrity. Following that, I had to ""put myself out there"". That meant applying to 3,000 jobs in four months with the bar set high: I decided what I felt I was worth, monetarily and with regard to benefits, and sent out these job applications all day, every day for 120 days (roughly). Given that my requirements included making a 6-figure salary and I never finished college, this was definitely setting the bar high. You might've heard this before: shoot for the moon, and you'll land among the stars.  Once I made these first few steps and took the initiative, things started falling into place. Inertia is funny: when you've made up your mind to be motivated and eat, drink, sleep, think, breathe and live it every second of every day, it gets easier and easier with each passing moment. I lost 70 pounds in that first year (largely from a VERY low-carb diet). That made finding a girlfriend MUCH easier (which happened almost immediately, even though I was still living in my mom's basement, and that relationship lasted for 3 years). I did get a good job, and that led to my dream job later on.   All in all, I will sum it up like this: you've already decided that a change needed to happen. That's why you wrote this post in the first place. Now you have to decide that you WILL ACTUALLY DO IT. That decision is one you're going to make every day when you wake up, and every second you're conscious from there forward. Focus only on this moment right now, and deal with it, and when the next moment comes, you'll deal with that.  I would highly recommend to you ""Rules of the Game"" by author ""Neil Strauss"". This book is written for people who want to learn how to meet women, which is great all by itself, but more importantly it has 30 days of exercises designed to teach you how to find your self-confidence. This will get you started. There are tons of people in this subreddit who can help you figure out where to go from there. This is my first (and possibly last) post here, as I'm not a huge Redditor and just happened upon your post by complete chance, so it probably won't be me... but that's irrelevant. The universe will keep sending you the right people at exactly the right times if you only keep your eyes, ears, mind and heart open to receive them.  I wish you not luck, because luck doesn't make for greatness: I wish you resolve. Choose discipline.   Choose life. You WILL succeed. Especially if you know that."

I've been doing HTML since I was 10 years old, but always settled for WAY less than I was worth. Around the time I started this process (and during the entire time I was applying for jobs every day) I had an odd job here and there fixing computers for little old ladies or doing ""bench work"" as a contractor, but again... with a horrible return on my investment of time.  Once I set the bar much higher, I was forced to become the person who could excel at the job I felt I deserved. I had to do a lot of self-study and even though I'd been doing programming for years, I had to up my game considerably. However, as I said earlier, inertia is a powerful thing, and once I had the right attitude and was dedicating myself to being better, my efforts included becoming the best I possibly could in my field. That's what took me to where I am now."

I've moved 4 times in the last 10 years, each time just starting anew, in a new location, in a new field, surrounded by new faces.  Inertia (or momentum) in life is a very real thing.    And 15 months ago I made a decision to hit the gym to better myself.  I quickly quit smoking, started eating healthier, and then quit drinking.  I eliminated the shit holding me back and changed the state of my health and physique forever.  The inertia in that change has altered my life.  Approaching the second year of my sobriety, I'm becoming financially focused.  I have no kids or a wife in my upper 20s and want to triple my income in the next 3 years in aviation.  Your bit about leaving social media is inspiring, thank you for that.  I've been considering deactivation for a while; you gave me another nail for the coffin.

DecidingToBeBetter,3a6ef7,chadee,3,Thu Jun 18 14:09:41 2015 UTC,"I found a job interview that was VERY promising in the right area for the right pay and the recruiter involved said they were ready to hire someone on the spot. I had decent knowledge of about 50% of the stuff they required, fairly weak knowledge of around 25% of the stuff, and virtually no experience with another 25%. I had about 4 days to prepare, at first, and spent 100% of that time studying my ass off to get together enough information just to pass the interview process.  Once I got the job, every day was a struggle. I was working in New York City about 55-65 hours a week across 6 days of the week (never knowing if I'd be needed in the office on Saturday or Sunday), with a 2-hour commute each way between the train and walking to and from the train station on either end. I spent 100% of my time on the train studying for the 4 months I kept that job before transitioning to the company I'm at now. During the first month, I spent 100% of my free time at home studying, and after that a bit less. Every day was a process of doing my best, taking inventory of where I was weakest, and getting better at the areas that needed work.  In case you wanted to tread the exact same path, I'd recommend learning HTML5, CSS3, LESS or SASS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and ES2015 (Harmony; the latest version of JavaScript) inside and out. I mean, complete knowledge without a cheat sheet or anything. Do flash cards, make your own audio books, read O'Reilly publications and online tutorials, DEFINITELY do some hands-on practice (which you can do for free at any cloud IDE provider or with JSFiddle); do whatever you must to become completely proficient -- unconsciously competent -- in this or any other field you wish to excel at.  If you put in the effort to make this your sole ambition for the next year, it will surprise you how easy it can be to outpace your peers. Most people get very distracted by all of the ""fluff"" in life. Make this the only thing in your field of vision, and you'll do very well."

Once I truly embraced that, i stopped fearing or avoiding struggle (criticism, muscle fatigue, fear of public speaking as examples) and started craving it. It is the adult version of marking your height on the door jam.    After awhile all those demons that you've avoided for years are vanquished and you start looking for struggle. It becomes like feeling around in the dark and when you discover a struggle, it's like a Christmas present! Free growth!!  I could go on forever."

For me I used physical struggle by jumping into solo camping, backpacking, climbing, bicycling (commuting up to 14 mi each way) and eventually a NOLS course.  By putting myself in actually stressful situations, where my (lack of) preparation had real and immediate consequences to my wellbeing, I slowly built this understanding of how to identify the necessary steps to reaching a goal from the steps that act only as a means to procrastinate.  Redundancy in a system meant to protect you is good, but at some point you have to trust what you have and move forward, else you'll be stuck where you are forever."

DecidingToBeBetter,3a6ef7,yourmomlurks,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"Excellent question. This is definitely one of the hardest parts to get past, and I'm happy to elaborate on it.  When you're stuck in the house, it's important to do something -- ANYTHING -- that will get you out the door. For me, this included taking odd part-time jobs (at basically minimum wage) that just got me out the door and forced me to interact with people and open up a bit. ANY amount of human interaction is better than none, and forces you to ""get outside your shell / comfort zone / out of your head and into the world"".  Meetup is also a terrific way to find things to do in your area, if you are willing to make a commitment to do something at least a couple of times. Find a group that meets EVERY week (even if it costs a few bucks, or isn't something you give a rat's ass about) because this will force you to become more social, and that's super, incredibly important.   Depression feeds on the feedback loop created when you're left alone with your thoughts. While it's true that it's possible to be depressed while you're going to a weekly book club, taking swing dancing classes, having a Friday night board game night with coworkers and hitting a climbing gym on the weekends, it's a lot less common among those who are active and social than among those who are spending all their time at home and online.  I want to call attention to one more point, because someone else mentioned above that ""at least you had friends online"". THESE ARE NOT REAL FRIENDS. It took me a LONG ass time to figure that out. Online interactions are not the same as in-person interactions, and they do very little to cure depression on their own. You really, absolutely have to get out of the house (no matter how uncomfortable that is) and get involved with other people; get some conversation going, figure out that rejection won't kill you, and maybe get a little oxytocin if you can manage some skin-to-skin contact.  Hell, even going to an AA meeting and pretending to be in recovery just so you can get some hugs and free counseling is better than sitting alone in your bedroom. (Personally, I did not enjoy AA when getting sober, and that really didn't work for me. I'm not hating on anyone it works for, and I honestly believe it could be valuable to someone suffering from depression even if they aren't an alcoholic... it just wasn't for me.)"

Just the other day I decided I have to start right now in doing something and stop with the empty plans without action.  Ive decided I want to get into the film industry as an editor. I did media in college and enjoyed the editing process and was usually the assigned editor, and I was given praise for it by teachers who otherwise didnt have a great word to say about me, because I was a mess back then from drug use and just generally a scumbag, in my tutor's words. Which were words with the best intentions, to tell me the hard truth that I needed to realise in order to improve.  And that took me 5 years to realise.

Dig deep into yourself and think: what makes you happy, and what do you want out of life? Those two answers should help you form big goals. Then break those big goals down into smaller and smaller ones until you have what we can SMART goals. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timely. You can easily Google SMART goals for more info on that.  As for social anxiety, there's 2 ways you can go about this. Make the hard choice and start talking to someone, i.e. a counselor about it. Or make the slightly easier to make but harder to perform choice of taking your problems into your own hands and trying out a self-led therapy techniques. Luckily technology makes it as easy as a smartphone app to work on your own social anxiety. I suggest Mevii or Joyable.   Mevii has a free 90 day trial, and Joyable has a 7 day trial, then both go to monthly payments, but both are cheaper than a counselor likely."

Step 1 is identifying that you are a lazy POS who is letting life go by him while he bitches and moans about life going by him. Step 2 is picking yourself up and getting the fuck out there. This isn't going to be instantaneous and most likely will take years. Good part is you are already at the bottom and there is no where to go but up.     Find a second job that utilizes your talent and education, don't even worry about how little they pay because you are doing this for experience. Once you get the taste of doing something you like it will spawn off into other new opportunities. You also need to start exercising, I don't care if you are already in decent shape. Exercise is going to release seratonin which is going to make you feel better and give you confidence.    Quit worrying about finding someone, you will. The overthinking of finding a girlfriend is causing you to not find a girlfriend. Just focus on you for awhile and one day you will walk around the corner at a grocery store and run into your future GF or wife. It happens.    Set small goals and when you reach them set some bigger ones. The internet, your parents, and your friends can only motivate you so far. It's up to you to get off your ass and start living."
DecidingToBeBetter,3a6ef7,LordLargo,6,Thu Jun 18 00:25:12 2015 UTC,"Everyone on here is going to give you a different set of advice based on all their baises, so here goes mine :). Hope you find something useful in this.  Firstly, get all of the hyperbole out of your scripts. We all have these scripts we tell ourselves in order to maintain the stability of our egos so we don't fall into a panic and self-destruct. I mean ego in the psychological/technical sense of your conscious description of your personhood, how you describe yourself. Get all of that self indulgent, hyperbolic pity out of your scripts and focus on the practical matters you want to change..  Here is an example of what I mean. The sentence ""My entire life, I’ve been the poster child for lack of self-confidence."" should instead read "" I would like to build my confidence."" Get all that self indulgent pity out of there and express the idea for what it is: a desire to improve yourself and your circumstances.   Do that to everything you have this kind of script about and turn them all into a practical expression of what you are actually after. ""I never have money"" becomes "" I would like to earn more money"", and so on and so forth.  Now that your scripts have changed, the shape of your ego changes from a down trodden, suffering, shy person to a person who is building their future. You're no longer a person suffering from something, you are a person doing something. You walk around thinking your scripts ""I would like to make money as an artist"" not ""Why did I choose a major where I can't make money?"". Acting, not suffering.  From there, you can do what others like /u/MyMevii suggested and get goal oriented. The main suggestion I have here is do not get too caught up in trying to follow a system and just think logically about the problem itself. If your new script says ""I would like to make money as an artist"" your first question should be ""How do artists make money these days?"". That will turn into an answer like ""They do art shows where they sell their original work and prints."" Then that turns into another question ""How do they put together the art shows?"" and an answer ""They seek sponsorship, rent a space, market their work, network with the art community, etc."" then more questions ""How do I get a sponsor, how do I rent a space, how do I market my work, how do I network with the art community?"" and so on and so on. Follow this chain of questions and answers until you find whatever loop you need to support yourself with whatever it is you choose to do, art, design, consulting, rainstick making, basket weaving, finance, car racing, whatever.   Good luck."
DecidingToBeBetter,3a6ef7,screenwblues,5,Wed Jun 17 17:25:35 2015 UTC,"I am an artist too. Professional artist now.  You want the truth? Ok, here's the truth.  No one gives a fuck about you. They don't care about your problems. They don't care about your reasons for why you can't do things. You are nothing to them. You are nothing to everyone.   Except one person.  Unfortunately, it's a person who can't see their value, intelligence or ability so you're fucking lost. And, no, no one cares you're lost either.  That one person is you.  Good news. Because no one cares, you don't have to do anything. No one expects you to. You're smart enough to subsist. And emotionally aware enough to know that you're just subsisting. Congratulations - you have a glorious shame spiral ahead of you. And you'll feel really great about it, locked in your security that the world conspired to stop you from being happy. It's a soft 50 years - probably peppered with substance abuse, failed relationships and self-contempt, but it works. I have seen friends make this choice.  Here's your other option. You decide to take control of your life, risk everything, strive, push until you're exhausted. Until you dream hurts so much that you want it do die but you've tried so hard that you can't give up because it's a reflex.   How?   That's up to you. Literally. Like I said, no one else gives a fuck. Not your parents, not the internet, no one.   Do shit or talk shit. That's your choice. Now shut the fuck up and make that choice.   I don't care what you do. No one cares what you do. Except you.   I made my choice. My life was full of heart break that I couldn't have imagined because I chose to fight.

I do know that I am way behind in life compared to other friends of mine but you know what, I just spent 7 months working in the bahamas! How many people can tell you they experienced that in their life, not many! Also, I do go on dates which usually leads no where because girls quickly figure out that I don't have my shit together at all although, once again, I just bought a brand new car so that does give me somewhat some credibility about being mature and grown enough to pay my own shit.  I also have this horrible disease that no doctor can figure out, I get like these huge bumps on my nose that come in clusters and will keep me locked up at home for several days every time I get them, quite frankly, I honestly think that's the reason I'm a little further back than everyone else because I've skipped a lot of opportunities because of this. Like skipped dates (one tonight actually) and called in sick for jobs which eventually got me fired and things like that.  No one can understand my situation which fucking sucks, my dad just says ""get over it, it's not a big deal"". Well it is to me, when these bumps surface, my entire nose swells up and it becomes extremely painful even when I don't touch it, can you imagine?  I went to see a doctor yesterday and I actually told him I've thought of killing myself because I don't see the point in trying anymore because everytime I see the light at the end of the tunnel I get one of these ""mysterious cluster fucks"" on my nose and I just quit every thing immediately and fall back to the isolation of my room or basement.  Anyways, all this to let you know, that it could be worse but I do understand where you are coming from.

It's slightly terrifying at times. I am aware that comparisons are counter productive and are even limiting my enjoyment of small victories. Thinking that the best people's lives aren't as grandiose as they make them out to be doesn't exactly help either - 1.

DecidingToBeBetter,3a6ef7,hithazel,2,Wed Jun 17 23:55:33 2015 UTC,"Think of people who are successful, driven, effective, and that you can look up to. None of those people think or talk in the pattern that you are using when you write this post. Your issue isn't pity partying or needing to get your shit kicked in- it's that you don't seem to have a direction in which to head. It's not enough to be angry or frustrated with yourself for not doing something. You have to seize internally upon a direction to head once your moment of clarity of frustration clears up.  Becoming momentarily inspired is easy- for many people it happens every few days. You have a big idea. You want to make a change. The problem is not that you don't have an idea or some momentary will to change- the problem is that your day-to-day habits don't involve you in anything that could be considered productive or important.  The direction that you head in from this point isn't of consequence. The point of consequence is that you start to rewrite this architecture of habits and you construct your behavior in order to send you in the direction of some project or goal. Having a habit toward a goal is much more effective than being inspired toward a goal, because inspiration fades. Habits just start to happen without your control.   Right now, if you aren't thinking about it, you get up, go do something, your default position is to go back to your room and reenter your previous habit. This is the thing that has to change- the habit that funnels your energy back into an unproductive activity.  And, of course, constructing a new habit from scratch is the more complicated part. You can't be inspired into a habit. You can't have your shit kicked in to suddenly jump start a habit.

(or if dating continues to go the way of tinder and casual hooking up, maybe never) there's no real sense of responsibility for a man anymore, as long as he has his basic needs met. whatever extra income he has is essentially beer money. the women in his life come and go freely and there is no place for him to set his two feet upon. this gets harder every single day.  this is not a rant against feminism. nor is this to talk about the plight of the male gender. however, this does mean that men lack a real sense of purpose in life. this is even easier to feel when you realize you are just one of 3+ billion men on this earth. it sucks. it feels pointless. it feels like the world is telling you to go out and do something great and be inspired and motivated, but this will never come. unless you are extraordinarily lucky.  the goal is to find, if not build, your purpose in life. the problem is: i can't tell you how to do this. no one can - because it's YOUR purpose.  fortunately, i do have a few things that might set you in the right direction:   stop trying to build confidence. confidence is not something in and of itself that you can build. it comes with other things - competence at doing things, being comfortable with who you are, a skill set, achieving goals, building strong personal boundaries. these are all things you can do RIGHT NOW in your bedroom. do things that make you afraid. read ""The War of Art"" by Steven Pressfield, it will be a major kick in the ass for you.  find a mentor. a long-term one. someone you can ask /make requests in real life like the one you did here. James Altucher wrote a great article on this: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-altucher/the-ultimate-guide-to-fin_b_7585792.html ""seek your purpose"" sounds like an impossible task, i know. so try this: save up a few hundred bucks. plan a ~3day get away to somewhere close by, without a lot of distractions. take a few books with you - not fiction, not novels, but books that are meant to change the way you perceive the world - this could be books on success, on philosophy, etc. read them. unplug. no wifi. turn off your phone. no newspapers (it doesn't matter what's happening in the world that day). and spend some time in solace and solitude. spend a lot of time asking yourself this question: ""if I were to leave this earth next week, what would I need to accomplish that would make me feel like my time here was well-spent"" start there. when you return from your trip, you have a week to work towards it."

Going balls out ""I am going to overhaul my whole life in one shot"" is just setting yourself up to fail. Take it one thing at a time.  Maybe start with looking for a better job. You have done retail, you have an art degree and create art. Are there any galleries where you live where you can get a job. How about a museum, even if it is just in the gift shop. Get out of the measly retail job and into something that is closer to your degree and what you like. Yes, it may still be retail but it is a step closer. If you get into a museum job there are other areas you could potentially work that are not retail."

DecidingToBeBetter,3a6ef7,spectyr,3,Wed Jun 17 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"Lots of good information here.  I hope you take advantage of some of it.  Here's a little something from me to add:  Learn how to manage your money.  This is a simple skill that everyone should learn that can give you some real confidence, and give you some real options.    You said that you are always broke.  This should never be the case, and it's a common source of anxiety and stress.  It can also be an excuse you are using to keep yourself from getting out of your rut.  Stop living paycheck to paycheck, and learn how to live within your means.   There are lots of resources out there for how to do this (so many, in fact, that it can be very daunting), but I'm going to keep it simple by referring you to only 2:   /r/personalfinance You Need A Budget -YNAB   You Need A Budget - YNAB is a budget tool, but more than that it's a simple and complete strategy for making a budget and sticking with it.  You do not have to buy their software to use their strategy -- they post the whole strategy online.  And the software is really just a glorified Excel spreadsheet.  However you want to do it, do it.  You will be amazed at how much less stress you'll have in your life if you learn to live within your means and manage your money wisely.  And this can open the doors to hope again because it gives you options.  Options that may only seem like wild fantasies at the moment.  When you budget, you'll know immediately where your money is going, and it will enable you to start making realistic goals again, track them over time, and hit those milestones.    /r/personalfinance has tons of helpful people, great advice, and some real success stories.  While you're learning how to budget, they can give you great tips on how to save money or earn more money.  Get involved in that sub...start reading it frequently and see how several other people in similar situations as yourself have learned to dig themselves out of that situation.  It's also a great motivator when you can see how other people do it.    You seem to be sitting in neutral right now, but you have the ability to put your life in gear and move forward if you want to take it.  Start by managing your money which is the fuel your life needs to get moving."

If you can't find a job that needs an art degree, it is time to rebuild yourself.   I would suggest learning programming. Anyone can do it - it doesn't really require math as logic is more important. Also, you can start out making serious bank. I'm 6 months in to learning it and plan on searching for my first job soon. Check out a website like Codecademy.com and try their HTML/CSS course. Then move on to something like Python. They're both pretty easy to pick up.  Don't feel locked into finding a career related to your major. It's ok to let it go. That was one of the hardest lessons I've had to learn recently."

I could go on. There's also discrimination to take into account. EDIT: age, race, gender, social class, disabilities, etc.  I don't think that anybody should be stopped from doing anything they want to do as long as it is productive and ethical.

""My life isn't representing what I'm truly capable of"" and I'm taking steps to rectify that now. I've chosen to take control of my life.   I asked myself ""What do I really want?"" and with that answer my life has found new direction...Ask yourself ""What do I really want?"" or ""If my life were absolutely perfect tomorrow what would it look like?""

DecidingToBeBetter,3a6ef7,snowdorf,2,Thu Jun 18 04:57:29 2015 UTC,"Damn you remind me of myself. I remember being told I lacked confidence at my last job. I'm turning 29 soon.  Today I run an Amazon business thats on track to do over $500,000 in sales for the year and I have 3 employees. I started Nov 2014.  My suggestion is to you, you already know the answer. You're going to have to change your habits, basically don't expect new results if you keep doing the same things.  You're artistic, what a great and fantastic ice breaker and neat ability. I did a paint night with my girlfriend, see if you can host one of those as an instructor. You'll meet new people, be able to paint and have an ice breaker because everyone has a common interest and I'd imagine you'd be one of the better artists are you're an instructor so you shouldn't lack confidence. By doing that, it will open up new opportunities, maybe you'll meet someone that will hire you or offer you a job or it will be a good gig for side income and give you something to do with your time.   Meetup.com is a good site if you want to meet people.   Look at it this way, if people don't know you exist, how are you going to establish relationships / clients. You can start slow. I'm an introvert, I'd prefer to have people come to me and if I were in your shoes I'd host one of those paint nights. The one I went served drinks so it loosens everyone up, have some yourself. I'd suggest going to one as a customer to see if its something you think you can do.  You have to be unhappy, and I mean HATE your current position right now in order to change it, it has to become INTOLERABLE and you need to make an affirmation to yourself that you will NEVER allow yourself to live at such a low standard again. There's a cool sub called No More Zero Days you might like.   Also, no one knows what the hell they are doing, everyone is trying to figure it out as they go along, everyone is scared but the hell if you're not going to enjoy yourself during the process.   Read books too! How to Win Friends and Influence People is a great start.  You're on a good path, you want to better yourself. You're in a better position than most people having that inner desire. Hopefully something above struck a cord. Best of luck my friend. I'm cheering for you."

I've been told that I write well, and very intelligent, should be applying to medical school etc. but did not actually believe any of those things. My sense of self loathing got in the way, and has largely obstructed me from attempting anything that could potentially risk failure. In the past I used to motivate myself to move forward with negative self talk directed at my worthiness if I failed. I wonder if you need to examine the system of self-worth that you believe in. I think a person with a good sense of self-worth could find it in themselves to move forward, and a person with negative self-worth would struggle to move forward."

I was 27 and at a job I'd held too long from my early 20's with a degree in hand for a few years and didn't want to be doing it at 30, but couldn't take the time to even look for another one because of said lame job.  I quit, with no long term net other than knowing if I was gonna free fall I'd have to make something new work.  I figured people with families to support and everything lose jobs to layoffs and worser bs all the time with less to work with.  The freedom of quitting gave me the confidence (and time) to seek out new work in my real field and changed my life.  If you're living at home and there's any way you can plan for ~3 months of living and loan payments, or borrow from a trusted relative just to make the transition, you're at the age where you can take on a responsibility like that and make a leap if you want it and are ready.

You can't rely on the critisism of others to build your character. You seem to want to internalize critisism and thats a great trait  but you have to be able to tell what critisism is helpful and what is just spiteful judgement. You don't take relationship advice from someone who can't keep one together.  Anyways let me read the rest before i continue................. okay, i personally think you need to get mad at something starting with yourself. Think back to when you were a child and wanted to be something. I know you think you know where im going but that kid the kid you were is fucking pissed at you and still a part of you. They were your ambitions. That kid did what they had to do to get into and go through art school. That kid can look at something simple like getting a girlfriend and do it. Internalize that kid, walk with them daily. Your dead inside not living just surviving. Strive for something,hunger for change, and pursue it. Start taking an interest in other people they are just as fucked up as you are. Make good friends and find a good partner a good partner will sustain you and lift you when your falling. Don't be afraid to fail. Your situation doesnt define you and a good partner doesnt care about a persons situation they care about the person.  But i've went of on a tangent. Have fun and try things you don't think you can do ive only bowled or played horseshoes 1 time but i was great at it. Like i could bowl 900 if i put my mind to it good.  The internet can't save you. It can offer advice but only you can get off your depressed ass and decide to be a person.the internet will be here whenever you need advice but its up to you to do something.

The fact of the matter is, we aren't responsible for your shit, your parents aren't, your friends aren't. You are. Stop blaming your self confidence and anxiety, start getting treated for those issues.  Pick your shit up and be responsible. Do it, one task at a time, one day at a time.

And yep you guessed right, that person is you.    You seem to be capable of accepting responsibility for your actions so that's a much easier platform to start with than if you were blaming everyone else. You say you have potential, but as youve clocked on to; potential without action is useless. You need to find a way to begin using your potential. When you get up in the morning, before you do any ""daily"" task. Take the time to do something that'll progress yourself. What that is i dont know, only you'll know, but do SOMETHING.   Time. You need to value your time, at the momment youre squandering it on nothing. But if you valued time do you think you would spend it wisely? I think you would. But how do you develop valuing time? One of the best way to value time is to value yourself, see yourself as someone worth spending time on. Once you're able to that you'll be able to use your time more effectively. You may also find that you no longer want to waste your time on a menial job because you value your time much more. How to value yourself and your time more? Theres no exact science as a lot of the value you place in yourself is based on upbringing, childhood and life experiences. But as an adult you now have the power to make changes.  Last but not least. You are not alone there are millions, perhaps billions at various ages that feel as you do. So youre not alone with your situation. There is nothing wrong with you."

Your problem seems to be learned rather than a chemical one (although you might want to check that as well) with Mindfulness I've managed to realize the feelings of anger right on time and lower them down.

DecidingToBeBetter,3a7w5x,gromath,2,Thu Jun 18 00:12:21 2015 UTC,"I think the first step is to try to become more self aware.   For the next week observe your own feelings and reactions to things from the outside...As if you were watching yourself like a fly on the wall.   When you feel yourself reacting to something like getting anger...become self aware that the reaction is happening and and calmly stop yourself and make a resolution to handle it better.  I like to pinch myself when I find myself drifting into negative thought land...it reminds me I'm in control of myself and not my emotions!  It'll take time but I think as you do this more and more it will fundamentally help shift your reactions.  In other words Notice how you feel- Pinch/Stop yourself- Resolve and tell yourself to calm down. Heck even Whisper or say to yourself ""I am the one that is control"" and back it up with all the Guts and Determination you have!  You can do it! You are sick of feeling this way! You can choose a better path! You are more than your emotions! You are in control. You can choose.   You are not a slave...You are a free man/woman."

It may be helpful to read about or watch others interacting civilly, angry as they may be. Once you've done that, practice behaving in a civil manner regardless of the anger you feel inside.  It might seem in the moment that you can't control your reaction, but this is simply not true and is more an excuse than a legitimate justification."

Not just I want to make more money- Or else I could say ""here's a dollar."" or I want to lose weight..and you lose one pound.  The problem usually comes from when you ask someone ""Well what do you want?"" and they answer ""I don't know.."" Fuzzy Goals will give you fuzzy results!  If you're having trouble just pick something you've been meaning to do and focus on that one thing! I know a lot of people who say ""But I have too many interests!' Just pick one and go for it! Get good and master one thing! I believe most people fail because they Major in MINOR things..AKA too many things at once!  What's a specific measurable result you want?  Step 2) WHY DO YOU WANT! - This one is so important. Most people don't take the time to write down why they want something.  Is it because it'll make you sexier? Will Doing what you do help make poeple happy? Will it make you fulfilled? Will it allow you to have a significant Impact on the world?  In Contrast...what do you lose out on if you don't do this? Will you never reach the places you want to be? Will it mean your poor forever? Will it mean you're settling for a subpar weight, A subpar relationship? In other words....What's the worst case scenario? Sometimes we need to fear the worst to perform at our best.  3) Then make up the Action plan. Action without knowing what you want and why you want is unsustainable...But if you have a clear Goal with Clear reasons you can develop a laser focus...  A focus so deep NOTHING can stop you because you'll want it so bad.  Many great achievers have done this. Sports Legends like Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretsky knew what they wanted and pushed themself to be the BEST THEY COULD. That was the STANDARD they set for themselves...Because they had a clear vision..They knew why they wanted it..and that let them pursue their goals relentlessly."

I suspect you will have great success learning to float above your surface thoughts.   Besides the practice around meditation listen to lectures on the 8-fold path. This will give you material to use to think about, and let you discover for yourself what patterns of thought, of caring and of holding negativity, make for you. You will find it on your own without it being imposed on you which is much more valuable than just being told what to do and think.  Get yourself a podcast app or something if you don't have one already, and look into 'audio dharma' and dharmaseed.org for some talks on useful subjects.  Also look into 'loving kindness' meditation."

DecidingToBeBetter,3a2rpx,LiterallyPizzaSauce,0,Sun Jun 28 15:20:27 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure transcendental meditation is basically a huge for-profit scheme/scam which packages the basic concepts of mindfulness meditation and sells it / trains it to people, and/or presents it as some kind of extra-special type of meditation which they developed or something.   1) The TM organization is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization, and the officers don't make much money. In fact, after the SNAFU with Deepak Chopra, the old monk decreed that never again would anyone find it easy to make large sums of money by being involved with TM, and required that anyone who wanted to help run the organization at the level that Chopra had been involved with, would need to PAY the organization $1 million for the privilege.  For some reason, people seem to think that charging a large sum of money insures that you make lots of money, but in fact, the opposite is often the case. The old monk deliberately raised the rates to learn TM to 10x what they used to be, and 1/100 the number of people started. This obviously doesn't help the bottom line, but he insisted that he had his reasons. At one point, just before the old monk died, the income from teaching TM was less (far less) than the income from wealthy donors, and the TM organization was constantly in the red. They have since dropped the price, and the number of people learning has gone up about 5-fold.  Now, in addition to the people who officially run the TM organization, several extremely wealthy people have been involved over the years. Most notable was Sam Walton, whose fortune was divided amongst his kids, making them collectively the richest family in america (none of them do TM as far as I know). So... somehow, this organization that collects, either through fees to teach meditation, or donations, about $5-$20 million per year, is being used by the wealthiest people int he world (worth easily 20,000x as much) as some kind of ""get rich scheme.""  Yeah right. Their IRS Form 990's are available online. As  you can see, in 2013 they collected $21 million, the best they have done since well before the old monk died. That included teaching 14,500 people to meditate, with fees of about $13.7 million, about half of which immediately was paid back to the individual TM teachers.  Another $4.5 million revenue was donations.  The highest paid executive was the finance director, $42,000. The executive director, John Hagelin, was paid $36,000.  2) TM teachers train for 5 months, in-residence, to learn the teaching methodology that Maharishi Mahesh Yogi used when teaching meditation. They learn the exact words, body language, hand-gestures and tone-of-voice to use when giving new information and/or answering questions. They learn modify what they teach based on teh level of experience of the meditator.   MBSR takes a week to learn to be a mindfulness teacher. TM takes 20 weeks to learn to be a TM teacher. You can think of TM instruction as a teaching play (the teachers train the same way that actors do (Drama-acting was my first major in college so I'm familiar with this)) performed over 4 days, with plenty of room for improvisation and audience participation. What or not this is important is not something we can decide in an internet forum, but using the play analogy, claiming that you get ""exactly the same thing"" by reading a book or webpage as you do be watching a play performed by highly rehearsed professionals, would get you laughed at.  The difference is: a play is more complicated.  TM teachers work for 4 days to help their students absorb an intuition about what it means to ""think a mantra without effort"" (that being the ""technique"" of TM). However, that's 4 days, an hour a day, just to help you grok that 5-word sentence. If you think that that can't possibly be of value, too bad. Many people find it of great value.  In addition to the 4-days teaching, all TMers have the right to go to any active TM teacher in the world and ask for help with their meditation. In the USA, this help is always free.  As well, not everyone pays a fee to learn TM. The David Lynch Foundation works with existing organizations (see link) to teach TM for free, and currently, there are negotiations with the governments of Brazil, Paraguay and Peru, to train 10's of thousands of existing school teachers to become TM teachers, so that all (in the case of Brazil and Paraguay) or some (in the case of Peru) public school students can learn TM for free, taught by government employees trained as TM teachers. Basically, they want their students to end up like the students mentioned in this NBC report on TM in public schools.  In Africa, the United Nations and other organizations tasked with dealing with the refugee problem in Africa, are doing their own independent research to see if the pilot studies on PTSD in Africa can be replicated. If the independent research validates the original studies, those organizations ALSO are talking about having relief workers trained as TM teachers, so that TM can be taught for free to refugees.  In fact, the David Lynch Foundation is projecting that over the next decade or so, as many as 100 million people will learn TM for free, taught by school teachers, prison employees, counselors, disaster relief workers etc., as part of their day job working for state and national governments, as well as international organizations like the United Nations.  3) TM mantras are chosen from a short list (it varies, from what I can tell, depending on when you learned to be a TM teacher). TM mantras are meant to become more pleasant to think, as the meditation practice ""deepens."" This makes the ""mechanics of TM practice"" --allowing the mind to wander in the direction of greater happiness-- to be as efficient as possible, because the deeper the meditation, the more attractive the mantra becomes.  This is very different than just about any other form of meditation out there (not counting the people who trained as TM teachers and now work independently or who have devised their own teaching methodology based on what they learned from the TM organization).  .  You may think TM a scam, but not everyone agrees with you."

Give the life you have your best shot before you write it off :)  Happiness is affected by but not inherent to a (good) relationship/ marriage/children. Some of those things make it harder to access those emotions than others. But personally I find I need to have my own garden on the inside.  Instead of telling yourself to relax/chill out/be nice, ask yourself what bothers you and why and whether its really worth your brain space/peace. If its worth the energy or important, retaliate.  Change your self-talk, you'll have enough people annoying you with the 'chill out's. I speak from experience :P   Try and actively live life through your perceptions, instead of just going through the rhythms. Appreciate. Enjoy.  About the bitterness, maybe that's your 'process'. I spent a lot of high school being bitter about how I was treated and my situation and can speak from experience that it was part of my 'process'. To protect something within me. And all these years later, I have been lucky enough to cross paths again with some of those people, and even spend good times with them, silently resolving issues and recognising that so many of their actions stemmed from flaws within them.

Most likely, you won't allow your own emotional needs to be recognized because you suffered some trauma in the past in an attempt to have those needs met.

And while some of my best qualities come from the way I was raised, I can definitely see that many of my shortcomings on an emotional level stem from my parents, as well. However, the way I look at it, I'm old enough to know (and be) better, which makes my issues all the more frustrating because so many of them seem to exist on a subconscious level. I won't use the parents excuse for everything, but I do think it plays a part."

For some reason, I always equated a narcissistic personality with someone who was well off in life. After reading some of the traits of a narcissist, I'm starting to think I may have dealt with that growing up and didn't even realize it because I bought in to my parents' mantra that the world was against them. And it seems I may be carrying some of that with me, as well."

Making a decision means there are no other options than what you've decided.  If you've decided to quit smoking..Smoking IS NEVER AGAIN POSSIBLE.  If you've decided that you don't deserve anything less than the best for yourself..YOU NEVER SETTLE FOR SECOND BEST AGAIN.  A real decision is one that forges an identity in my opinion.

DecidingToBeBetter,3a2en6,ddddecidua,8,Tue Jun 16 18:18:58 2015 UTC,"First, I see from your previous post history that you're on /r/SuicideWatch.  This is good, keep reaching out and connecting with people.  Secondly,  you say you've tried therapy.  What about it didn't help?  Did you feel like your therapist understood you?  Is medication a viable option for you?  It's good you've tried different hobbies... is the reason you didn't stick with it because of you just felt generally bad about doing it?  An old therapist once told me that ""depression can't hit a moving target"".  Sometimes even if you're doing something and you still feel that heavy weight on you, you simply have to keep doing it.  Over and over again.  Keep doing lots of stuff over and over again.  How long did you stick to a particular hobby? A week or two isn't enough.  Not even a month or two.  You have to just keep going.  I find it hard to believe that you are 100% ugly with no chance of improvement (unless you have a facial defect... and even then, plenty of people that are not attractive are still happy).  For most cases, if you're body is in shape, you can still be considered attractive to someone.  Any everyone, barring severe physical handicaps, can get into shape.  You're feeling sorry for yourself... and you know what?  I understand.  I've been depressed.  I've felt isolated.  I've felt that there is no reason to go on.  But you need to find the voice in your head, even if it's tiny, that keeps whispering that maybe you can do it.  Pay attention to that voice.  Let that voice be your friend, your champion.  Life is difficult.  You have to take baby steps.  Get into a pattern and stick with it.  Make a deal with yourself: do xyz things for a year, consistently, and see how you feel.  Those things could be seeing a counselor, working out 3 times a week, and volunteering once a week.  Or anything else.  Make a plan, stick to it, and reevaluate.  If that mean voice inside your head starts telling you: there's no point, why bother.... then COUNTER it with... what's the harm in trying to be the best that I can be? or maybe ""I made a plan, after a year, I'll reevaluate.""  Just counter that negative voice.  Things aren't going to fall into place all at once.  You're not going to work hard for a few months and find tons of friends, look super great, and never feel bad about yourself.  Baby steps.  And you know what?  It's okay to feel depressed every once in a while.  It's okay to not have it all together.  Because no one is happy all the time.  No one has got it all together.  You just have to keep trying, and find the little things that make you smile.  hugs"
DecidingToBeBetter,3a2en6,DaEnvironmentSelects,4,Tue Jun 16 23:22:42 2015 UTC,"Being locked in a room with no purpose drove me to profound and dangerous depression. So find a way to knock that off right now.  Go out and do things. Join a gym. Walk a dog. Meet friends. Set a schedule and keep to it. Discipline is more important than motivation.  Chase a job like you're desperate. Get one and look for another. Throw yourself into your work. Be the best damn burger flipper that McDonalds has ever known. Nothing is beneath you right now, because a job - no matter how inane the purpose seems - could save your life.

They just live to live. If you're anything like me, just doing stuff isn't good enough.   I was depressed for 4 or so yrs and didn't start actively participating in life for another 2. What caused me to stop wallowing in self pity? I knew I could be successful. I'm tall, somewhat attractive, athletic, intelligent and I love to read and learn. None of this mattered to me though. I knew I could work my ass off and achieve material success, but I'd still be unhappy. I needed a reason beyond my own temporary,  fickle wants and needs.   Up to this point I'd been agnostic/atheist/clueless. I'd been the type of person who needed evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. I lacked faith in every area of my life, but I decided to do my research. The short of it is, I now live my life for something greater than myself. I serve God and my fellow man. I couldn't live my life any other way. Never been happier. I have goals, direction, and I believe that my efforts will last."

When I first moved out of my parents house, I was so overwhelmed with all of the expensive things I needed to buy and unexpected costs and just so many things that I had to do and I felt like I was drowning. I have never been so stressed in my life. So I wrote down every thing that I had to do. I made a to-do list and I took care of every single thing one item at a time. As time continued, I continued to add to the list and cross things off. I've been working off this same piece of paper for the past four years now and it has some pretty cool shit on it. Now I look back and see how far I've come and how much I can really accomplish. So now no matter how scary a task might be, when I write it down it doesn't seem so hard compared to the things I've already done.   Some examples of things crossed off my list now are:  -pay off student loan   buy a bed frame    -pay ridiculous phone bill   learn french save up first and last    -move halfway across the country   -buy a new car  Stuff like that. This to do list sits in my drawer and it serves as a reminder that I can really do anything."

DecidingToBeBetter,3a2ile,mananiux,3,Tue Jun 16 18:45:47 2015 UTC,Deep breathing meditation for sure.  When your trying to replace a habit with a new one it helps sometimes to try to figure out what need that old habit was fulfilling..  For instance with smoking-   For some people its simply the social aspect- Everyone goes outside for a smoke and socializes.  For some its the deep breathing relaxation- In which case deep breathing meditation might help.  For some it might be the nicotine kick- Try replacing it with a small cup of coffee when you need a boost.  It can be fun to experiment with your habits and see what works and what doesn't when breaking and forming new habits.  I used to get a craving to eat around 9-10pm at night...and I figured out it was because my body just needed some extra energy around that time. So instead of going for the chocolate bar I drink a small cup of tea now!   Helps the waistline :)  Anyhow yeah my 2 cents:)

DecidingToBeBetter,3a2ile,ArtSchnurple,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:07:10 2015 UTC,"This is a little odd, but you know what's really soothing to me?  Cough drops.  Like Hall's Mentho-lyptus cough drops.  I feel like they calm down my breathing and make me slow down and chill out even if I'm not actually having a coughing fit.  I don't know if it's just the slow breathing from inhaling cough drop fumes, or if inhaling the ingredients is actually calming or what, but it works.  And if you're quitting smoking, it sometimes helps to have something to substitute for cigarettes, and this could be a good one.  Hard candy is a common one (my mom did Brach's cinnamon candies, and is now smoke-free for almost four decades), and this combines that with inhaling, and is calming to boot.  Just a thought."

Keep it external and find new things once you get distracted from the sensations you've already found.   If you don't like that, I like the visual exercise of fast memorization. Pick a busy space, open your eyes for 5 seconds, close them, and try to remember everything you can see. Repaint the picture in your mind, keeping as much detail as possible.   I find these quick exercises can divert negative thoughts or emotion for long enough for you to handle them in a more constructive manner."
DecidingToBeBetter,3a1cy2,meowkittyxx,5,Tue Jun 16 13:40:14 2015 UTC,"I've recently been reading a good amount about the difference between self esteem and self compassion.  There are great talks by researcher Kristin Neff. Self esteem is good but relies a lot on fleeting feelings. ""I look good today"",  ""I did well on an exam so I feel smart"". Also it often encourages comparison to peers and others, ""I am smarter than her"",  ""I am better looking than him"". Self compassion is more about extending love and compassion inwards towards yourself. Not to evaluate or commend yourself on momentary aesthetic victories or temporary accomplishments but to extend love and care to yourself as a constant regardless of the situation. I highly recommend listening to her Ted talk. Not exactly what you asked but throwing my two cents in. This has been helping me lately, as I've often struggled with self esteem my new goal is self compassion."

It's like using past experiences to build legs under a table that say ""You know what? I'm actually pretty good at this, this, and this""   I was the same way...I had this ""I'm not good at anything"" mentality..when really I was getting good marks at school, I was(and still am) a good Saxophone player, I made my friends laugh...However, I chose to focus on things that I THOUGHT were wrong with me...that weren't actually true.  We all actually create a reality for ourselves that may or may not be accurate..so look at your life like a scientist and look at facts and try to examine yourself under that sort of lens instead of your own tinted glasses so to speak:)  Celebrate your strengths :) There's probably lots about you to like you just have to find it and continually focus on it :)"

Many people advocate Meditation and Mindfulness in this sort of situation which works great because it changes your focus.  For example have you ever had a bad day...then a friend called you up or you saw a friend or talked to someone and they made you feel better?  That's because they interrupted your current pattern of behaviour and helped you adopt a new one. We can try to do the same for ourselves.  Things I like to do to interrupt myself when I'm feeling low 1) Put on dance music and dance around my room like an idiot :)  2) Think about what I have to be grateful for instead. You can always change your focus by asking yourself questions like ""What's actually great about this?"" or ""What can I learn from this?"" or ""What do I have to be happy about in my life right now?""  3) Watching my favourite inspiring videos on youtube.  4) Imagine the situation you're in actually turning out for the better instead of the worse. We tend to freak out and imagine the worst case scenarios first..Ask yourself ""What if everything actually works out alright?""  5) Sometimes we just have to take things at face value. If the girl/guy you asked out said they couldn't go out on Friday..maybe it's not because they don't like you but because they're actually just busy.  6) Favourite funny TV shows!  7) Go for a run around the block!  8) Call a friend who you know will make you laugh.  9) Jump up and down and say ""HURRAY MY FEET AREN'T SUPER SMELLY""  The more you change what you do with your body the more immediately you can change what state your in and focus.

I think this is a great mindset. It's not to pat yourself on the back for doing minimal work but to encourage you to do more.   I've been going on walks and trying to take the stairs at work more. I will have to find more ways to incorporate this idea into my lifestyle.
DecidingToBeBetter,39uo4a,Notsuchameangirl,3,Sun Jun 14 22:55:49 2015 UTC,Go and spend some time on yourself. Go travelling with your SO. try woofing somewhere in your own country for a month or something. Don't  worry about finding a job straight away. You've been in education pretty much since you can remember win guessing so take a month off. I did that last year when I finished uni it's been 14 months now. I have no money but a good life.

DecidingToBeBetter,39uo4a,MelloFox,3,Mon Jun 15 13:26:36 2015 UTC,"I just graduated at 29 and I'm currently thru hiking the a Appalachian Trail. I've had a lot of time to think about ""strategies"" for the rest of my life. Some thoughts I've had that I think you can apply :  1) Continue your education. Get certifications in a field you're interested in, even if it isn't part of your Fine Arts field. Certifications in technology can be cheap and open doors.  You're probably already efficient in some kind of skills you can turn into certs.   2) Don't look at your next job as your career job. I had this problem where I was stressed about finding that perfect job. When you get back in the workforce, continue to look for better jobs, whether it's money or something you think you might enjoy more. Don't just get comfortable in your job.   3) Try new hobbies. This is the first time I've hiked and I love it. Leap into something and give it a shot. This could also open up more career opportunities. For example, I can get certified in a Wilderness Survival and done other related things, and it can only open doors.   4) Exercise and learn to cook/eat healthy. This directly impacts your mood and happiness.   5) Read up on personal finance and try to save some money.   6) Travel now. You don't have to spend a lot of money to go places. In the past, I was always trying to save enough money to take elaborate trips, but you could spend a thousand on a great trip to Thailand.   7) You can figure out that relationship, but I urge people your age not to get tied down to one person unless your 100% satisfied. Go on dates, get to know other people, and keep an open mind. Don't waste years of your life in a relationship you aren't happy in.   8) Do something awesome. Make these days your best days. Go jump out of an airplane, preferably with a parachute. Deep sea diving, parasailing, take a big trip. There's so much out there to do and I just stayed in a shell when I was that age.   9) Move somewhere new and see what happens. Do some research and see how you feel about moving. This might not be doable, but just remember that nothing has to be permanent. You have no obligations like kids so you have a freedom many people don't have. Enjoy it!   10) Read a lot, get involved in local politics, get passionate about something.   Good luck, congrats on graduating, and don't stress about life too much. Don't be afraid to look into stress management if you do. Take care of your mind and body (and spirit if that's your thing). Life is an amazing phenomenon, enjoy!"

I have small goals (at least one job application a day, even using mouthwash) and larger, season-based goals like finding a new job or getting an internship. Dividing a transition phase from where you are to where you want to be into tinier pieces may make this easier on you. I think you should take some time for yourself too. Good luck :-)"

I believe you already know what you want. Just take that one step. Write down a list of  5 important&urgent things to do. The CEO of Uber(a ride-sharing app)always does the same thing every single day.In the morning,they write down the 10 most important things that needs to be done that day. If they finish,they go to other stuff.  Go to the gym and tell your sister you can't make it. Do the second thing in your list.  Use the pomodoro technique.  About being assertive,it will take time. Be conscious when someone asks something and take a minute to decide if e.g going to the party is better than doing the laundry.  You can't help everyone. Be selfish when it comes to your goals and dreams and fight for it. People will always whine if you help them or not. You can't fix everyone. You don't have to. Ask yourself,how many times have people tried to fix you when you didn't have your shit together? (most of them didn't even notice.)  Read this book called The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins.  Something else,when you stop being Mr.Nice,people will refuse your new Xemnas81. Don't give a f**. Be you. They will even tell you,you are mean and bla bla bla.   All you need is to love yourself and take care of yourself.Be kind to yourself.   Don't ask permission from anyone.If you feel like buying something,go ahead.If you want to go skydiving,just do it.If you want to change your course,do it.

When you feel somatic arousal you can tell yourself that your excited or you can tell yourself that you're anxious, but they both feel the same way and you can learn to choose to interpret your arousal differently.

DecidingToBeBetter,39l3ft,Clarissamansplainsit,2,Fri Jun 12 15:50:48 2015 UTC,"A good friend of mine went through this in his mid 20s, especially with regard to music. He had a close group of friends who loved music, and it was something they really connected on and talked about a lot. At some point he realised that he was stopping himself from exploring and enjoying a huge range of music just because these friends could be pretty pretentious and scoffed at music they didn't consider cool.   He distanced themselves from the group, not wanting to feel restricted anymore, and simply started to listen to and read about artists he had always wanted to explore. It made him incredibly happy, and he felt like he was finally becoming more himself and learning a lot about who he is.   It might be important to note that he was what you would call a people pleaser. He grew up in a home with lots of emotional abuse, and learned a lot of anxiety around trying to fit in, not be noticed, and just get along with people. We all do this to a certain extent, but I believe that what he experienced as a kid and teen gave him terrible esteem issues as an adult. Working in therapy gave him more confidence, courage, and I guess permission to explore his own personality. It might seem like a small thing to simply listen to music that you like, but the wider impact it has on being comfortable with yourself and growing in confidence is significant indeed :)"

Be open about it. Some people don't like what you like, and that's true no matter what you like. And it's fine! People have different tastes, and that variety is what gives us so many things to experience and enjoy.  Instead of worrying about how people react to what you like and do, concern yourself with how you react to what they like and do. If you know that someone listens to music that you think is absolutely horrible, just think to yourself that that's not for you, and let them like whatever they like.

Eventually they go so long without realizing their own taste that they just grow accustomed to whatever is 'cool' at the time, like watching too many episodes of Roseanne.

Only the degree in which they let themselves be influenced and social acceptance of the subject matters. (for example, not getting married is acceptable now, but it wasn't years back)  I had to go to a similair process as you, but in a lesser degree, I don't suffer from anxiety as much. What I did was writing down the things that popped up in my head. It doesn't matter if they were doable, for that split second I wanted to do them.  I then organised them by long-term and short-term actions. For example, getting my own place was a long-term thing and trying some exotic thing from the Asian supermarket a short-term thing.  The objective I set myself was trying something new each month and working towards the long-term things. The point was not scratching anything off the list. Maybe I don't feel comfortable doing it now, but I might in a few months from now, or never, that's fine too.  A quick glance through your comments and I notice you just left college. This was the point in life my struggles hit me in the face. Since you have to decide to continue your education (but you need money) or get a job. It's like falling down a pit you can't see the bottom off.   What helped me out of that pit was exploring something readily available like food. I want to try peanut butter, chocolate sprinkled banana this week. Nobody can see me because I eat it at home. And if I find the courage to do that, I also have the courage to check out that new store I just passed.  I don't know if any of this is helpful to you. Maybe you need to work out some things first, that is between you and your therapist. You know how therapists say that support from others is important? It's not just about people supporting you, but also about people dragging you down.  Only last year I realised how negative some of my friends were. They kept pointing out the things I didn't do properly and laughed in my face when I did something they considered weird. My tip to you, try to notice this behaviour in others (if you want). It will take a long time to notice, but it will help you in the longer run.  Good luck on your journey and I hope you get the support you need from the ones close to you and the people on Reddit."

DecidingToBeBetter,39jlw5,sgjkbd2,8,Fri Jun 12 04:39:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are insignificant in the grand scheme of things. However, consider the following: Would you care if I kidnapped you, strapped you to a chair and then proceded to pull out your nails and then amputate toes, fingers and limbs without anaesthetics until you died from shock or blood loss? Of course you would.  Why? If you are as insignificant as you claim, surely you dying (even if the circumnstances are horrible) is just a drop of piss in the ocean, right? Well, yes and no. You care because my psycho plan would make you suffer, and you are really your entire universe. You may not be the least bit significant to most other goings on in the universe, but you are significant to yourself.  Now, the same reasoning also holds for positive experiences. Just like you'd rather not get tortured to death, you'd also rather not have a less pleasant time while you're alive than any easily obtainable options. If you got a choice between eating a cheese-and-mushroom omelet for breakfast and eating a literal pile of human feces, you'd chose the omelet simply because it gives you more pleasure (or less displeasure). Again, if your argument holds and you are truly insignificant, you'd be indifferent between the two choices.  Life doesn't have purpose, in the absolute sense. It has exactly the purpose you choose for it. If you choose to maximize your own expected pleasure, then you going to a concert or getting a degree or whatever won't be insignificant, because it directly furthers the meaning of life."

DecidingToBeBetter,39ie0d,stahp_tank,6,Thu Jun 11 22:45:09 2015 UTC,"So there's three main things and they all play into each other.    Diet. You need to get your body the fuel it needs. Regularly. If your diet is out of wack, start eating regular, healthy meals.  Exercise. If you start heavy lifting it'll make you tired at first, but you will have more energy once you get used to regular exercise. You can make a workout plan to suit whatever fitness goals you might have, just try to be active in some way 30-60 minutes a day. This will also help you eat better and accomplish number... Sleep. This is the big one a lot of people don't do. You need to get a regular 7/8 hours of sleep a day. Don't stay up between 2 and 5 AM every day and stay in bed till 1 PM, or have a super crazy sleep schedule. Don't bring your phone to bed with you to reddit or youtube. Try to fall asleep and wake up around the same time every day. If you don't live in a tiny apartment with no space, avoid being in your bed for reasons other than sleep and sex.   If you eat 3-4 healthy, regular meals a day with lights snacks in between, stay physically active for an hour a day, and sleep a full 8 regular hours every night, you'll feel much, much better. Tie this in with meditation and some kind of active pursuit (painting, music, cooking, gardening, reading, gaming, whatever you like that makes you use your hands and brain) and you'll be surprised at how much more you'll want to do.  And as far as doing things, this is gonna sound odd, but you just gotta do things. It's like inertia, the less you do, the harder it is to do anything, the more you do the easier. You have to train your brain to seek the activities you want for yourself. Try to find long term projects that you can work on on a regular basis.

I walk to classes and shops and things, so I'm generally getting about an hour total per day there, but whenever I've tried anything beyond that it just cannibalizes all of my energy for the next few days."
DecidingToBeBetter,39ie0d,KrunchyKale,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:16:25 2015 UTC,"Excercise is said to be very beneficial at dealing with depression and doesn't normally worsen it to my knowledge. If you're not accosstomed to the energy expenditure though, it will take a little while for your body to adjust, so it's normal to feel more physically exhausted when you start. If you're getting depression after exercise I'd talk to a doctor, but try to figure out if it's actually depression as opposed to just physical exhaustion. Wanting to lay down in bed for a nap at 1 pm isn't abnormal if you've just increased your energy expenditure.   Also, what my previous post said might come into play. If you're not eating enough, or are getting too much of your caloric intake from junk food, that could be a factor, because your body needs good fuel to perform. If you're not sleeping enough and/or sleeping too irregularly, your body probably isn't getting the rest it needs either.  If you get a good diet and sleep schedule going along with regular exercise and allow yourself to adjust for a week or two and still have this problem, I'd go see a doctor."

It's not physical exhaustion, though - if I had had classes today, I could have gone to those easily, though engaging in them would have been a different matter - it's the mental blockage against ""doing"" lack of energy, the ""drive"" energy, not really the metabolic energy."

Honestly, like 35-45% of my caloric intake is from fats on any given day :/   Like I said, this isn't really a physical exhaustion - it's the ability to choose to do something (homework, projects, etc) that gets damaged, not the ability to do.

If after taking good care of yourself you still have this problem, then you're in the other 10% of scenarios where you should see a doctor.  It sounds like your depression has worsened, but that could be linked to a physical problem or it might be a physical problem on its own.   A lot of the suggestions in this thread could help, as well as others:   go outside and get sunshine on you go for walks fix yourself some good wholesome meals turn off the TV and find other ways to relax, like reading or getting a massage or a bath or listening to music make sure you get good sleep - both enough hours and good quality.  Avoiding caffeine and alcohol in the evening, and turning off screens an hour before bed can help improve your sleep quality keep in touch with friends.  Go do something together, even just see a movie. do you have leave saved up at work?  Maybe you're burnt out from work and need a holiday.   All these things are pretty passive and low energy, but they're in aid of getting yourself well so that your motivation naturally returns, and you'll think of things then that you want to do with that motivation."

For me, sleep was the main issue. But better sleep is difficult to achieve if you havent had a tiring or mentally stimulating day.  Better diet is in my opinion the easiest to achieve. Its just a case of will power, which wont be there straight away but will develop.  If you improve your diet, that little boost of feeling better and less shitty physically each day could be the energy you need to be more active, and thus help you sleep better."

Honestly a couple years ago I felt like that to the point that I was convinced there was something mentally/biologically wrong with me.  Then I ended up on a vacation, just flew into a country and hopped in a rental car and spent two weeks on the road.  It forced me to do whatever I wanted to at that moment, made me feel like I was the most important person in my life, made me realize that it was worth doing things that would make me happy, and made me feel like the person in charge of my life.  It super revitalized me and gave me a purpose.  Two years later I've kind of fallen out of it again, and really got to get out somewhere where I get the same feeling.  On the other hand, I've done two days of 30-40 minutes on the exercise bike and honestly feel a ton better and more energetic than the past two months.  I think there's something to that whole ""Your body gets used to sitting around doing nothing and cuts your metabolism to nothing"".  The big stopper is actually taking that first step, but if you can get a couple days in, it seems tons easier."
DecidingToBeBetter,39ie0d,captfuzzypants,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:12:04 2015 UTC,"Easy one. Vitamin D. No, no, no. This isn't a dick joke. Take high quality vitamin D supplements.  Like, a bunch! Each pill will be 500 IU or 1,000 IU. It's recommended to get 4000 IU a day. I take 5-6 1000 UI pills a day. Some people go much higher. I find 5 a day, for a few days, makes a very, very noticeable difference in my energy levels.  It seems to take a few days for me to react when my energy is low.   We get vitamin D in two ways: Diet and sunshine (dermal synthesis) My guess is that, if you are like me, you work inside most of the day. Maybe sneak some sunshine on your lunch break and to/from work. It's just not enough for us.  Along with the vitamin D, a high quality once a day multivitamin is highly recommended. Maybe a B complex for nights out drinking.  Sure, your symptoms could be any number of things, stress/adrenal fatigue (Vitamin C), mental decompression/downtime, depression (again), poor sleep hygiene, etc etc etc.  I suggest Vitamin D because it's easiest and quickest first thing.

Many of the elements in our body are only formed when stars explode, so we are all children of the stars. When I try to comprehend the size of the universe, it makes me realise my problems aren't so big and probably aren't very important in the grand scheme of things. After hours of pondering I'm usually left with the conclusion; I only have a very short time to experience all the wonderful things us lucky humans get to enjoy, so I may as well go on enjoying the little things in life.

I think about this all the time when I go to post something crappy on Facebook or Twitter. It can really snow ball all that negative emotion. I'm still working on it, but I'm happy to hear that things are working for you! :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,39ezwe,EricParkerr,4,Thu Jun 11 11:17:08 2015 UTC,Exactly! It's like an echo chamber for all your negative thoughts and feelings to bounce around in.

I think in those cases, mulling it over in your mind and posting on the internet can keep those bad feelings in the forefront. Obviously I'm no expert and this whole comment is all pretty subjective though."
DecidingToBeBetter,39ezwe,EricParkerr,3,Thu Jun 11 12:43:43 2015 UTC,"I think that it's healthier to treat those things as what they are - psychological wounds. Bleeding lacerations on your soul. Understand that the anger is just a result of your pain, and that you're actually hurting, not pissed off. Let yourself hurt, mourn, and heal. It takes time, but that's okay. So does a broken bone.  What we're talking about is the petty stuff. Getting mad about traffic is just throwing an adult temper tantrum, and it's about as attractive as the kid who has a crying fit because you looked at him cross-eyed. The tough kid, who can skin his knee, get back up, and keep playing - you'll feel a lot more sympathy for him if he's hurt badly enough that he's crying.  So let's be tough, and only worry about the hurts that really matter. Those need to be talked about and let out, but eventually your healing will require you to simply stop making a big deal out of it. If you dwell on it for the rest of your life, it will fester."

One day I decided to change, deleted it, and made a new one and vowed to keep reasonably positive. It's definitely helped teach me to think of the positives before just being super negative (especially publicly).  In retrospect, I find absolutely no benefit to venting my frustrations in this way. This year I've furthered that by calling a friend/family and letting them know I want to vent, rather than just blowing up somewhere. It's done miracles for me. Really helps isolate the negative from the rest of my life just by saying ""I just did ____ and I'm so frustrated because _____"" rather than thinking ""one bad thing happened, everything sucks now and I'm mad."""

Professor Blastoff is a great combo of comedy and thought-provoking discussion (with a slightly heavier emphasis on comedy - the hosts are hilarious). Star Talk is hosted by Neil deGrasse-Tyson and is pretty funny/interesting. 99% Invisible is also a really fascinating look at some of the hidden-in-plain-sight elements of day-to-day life. State of the Re:Union is more social commentary and community-oriented story-telling, but is pretty interesting. Serial isn't particularly oriented towards education, but is super engrossing, and gives interesting insight into the American justice system. Hardcore History is a pretty engaging look at historical conflicts and figures. I also really enjoy The Infinite Monkey Cage - like Professor Blastoff, it's a fair mix of comedy and forum-based exploration of scientific and philosophical questions.

Smoking is an addiction just like overeating crap is too. Why are the two any different but ones okay while the other isn't?

DecidingToBeBetter,39eo13,meowkittyxx,2,Fri Jun 12 15:30:36 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing (well, I'm hoping) most of your reasons to ""justify"" your hatred for fat people rely on the systemic consequences of obesity, like increased insurance/medical costs, people who are so fat they're on disability, that sort of thing.  If this is the case, I urge you to consider this: Is it really fat people you hate, or is it a system that encourages obesity? Consider, for example, how cheap calorie-dense, non-nutritious foods like pasta, bread, and chips are compared to fresh vegetables. Consider how much easier it is to make a big plate of spaghetti or a sandwich or stop for fast food instead of a nutritious, balanced meal. Consider that we do not teach nutrition in public schools, at least not in any substantial way. And the next time you walk through a grocery store, ask yourself: How much space is dedicated to cookies, chips, crackers, sodas, and other boxed convenience crap, and how much is dedicated to wholesome, nutritious food that is part of a real balanced diet?  It's not that people shouldn't be held accountable for their decisions -- they should, and they usually are (by their health problems and public ridicule, if nothing else). It's that there are lots of systemic factors that play into the obesity epidemic that people don't usually understand, so they just blame fat people for being fat. I understand... it's a lot easier than stepping back to evaluate the other factors at play. But please do keep in mind that a lot of fat people are fat because they were never taught proper nutrition and dietary habits, and so they really don't realize how terrible their habits actually are.  A little sympathy goes a long way... and believe it or not, most fat people don't want to be fat. They just end up that way because their parents and educators didn't teach them better habits."

Children need some kind of structure, I am saying this as someone who has been homeschooled. Set aside specific time to teach and do it. Once they are done for the day let them go and play outside (or inside) but not spend all there free time watching TV. Homeschooling can be great if done right.

Remember it's not. If you fail this exam it will not be easy, but you'll find a way to move forward.   If you have a few extra min try to read the first few chapters of Learned Optimism by Martin E.

The book opens up with some brief information and then it jumps into a test he developed at the University of Penn. He goes in depth about scoring and explains what it all means. It was very enlightening for me to see how I felt that one action would change/ruin my entire life and even more so how I felt everything was my fault. It's also very easy to read and brown down into smaller headings so you don't have to read it all at once.   how did the test go?!"

I suppose I've learned a thing or two by then, so I just went with whatever was at hand.

DecidingToBeBetter,39f92d,_P_H_I_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:19:34 2015 UTC,"One of the things I've learned during the before the exam was that, no matter what happens, it was me who's responsible for this. Sure, I could have gotten a set of questions that I didn't have time to prepare for (there was a nasty yet rewarding question), but then, I could have prepared more thoroughly and be fine with it. I didn't, and this time, I got lucky, but otherwise, through the effort I've put in, I've gained a substantial amount of knowledge on the subject, which certainly helped me during the exam.  I knew that this is what I was going to learn - I figured it out rather early, before making the post. This knowledge - that I can jeopardize my own life so hard - was very pressing, so it is no wonder that I've felt powerless and unwilling to work, to take responsibility for my own failure. I would've never made such a huge mistake before because I never dared to do something this important to myself. Life was very easy for me up to this point.  Now that I think of it, it isn't the first time I folded down under pressure. I was in the university two years ago, and through my own neglect and self-indulgence I've messed my score on physical education. It wasn't very hard, running three big laps twice a week, yet I've made it seem so much harder and bigger that I backed down from it. The result was that I had to run those laps - five for each day of P.E. that I've missed - during summer, when everybody else were getting themselves prepared for the upcoming exams.  I knew I wanted to stay in the university - not because I liked it there but because it was a terrifying thought to let down my helicopter parents and look like a pussy in everybody else's eyes, as if many people cared - but even then, I could barely make myself do the laps. At first it helped that my friend - who agreed to miss those P.E.s with me - was running alongside, but then she stopped because her lap count was zero; mine was far more than that. I've made it through not because of my effort, but because one of the teachers pitied me and forgave the remaining laps, so I was free from P.E..  Running was exhausting, so I made it an excuse not to prepare for another academic debt. Long story short, I've spent the summer in a bad mood, not enjoying the time because I was mentally dooming myself to the big and scary monster of two-subject exam coming in September (I was allowed to stay in the university because I only had two). A short time after I've got through with it, I quit university - which left me where I was until very recently, with no education, no job, no skills and no work to show for the time alive.  As you can see, I wasn't a very productive kid - not to myself, not to others. The exam, though, taught me a very important lesson: quoting the wonderful blog post, ""You Are Free, Like It or Not"". Through how terrible I felt at the time of the few days before the exam, I've been made to understand that life is about the effort you put into it, and it sucks if you don't. I'm still not as productive as I was on my best days, but I'm certainly way better now: I don't neglect myself, I consider options of better living and strive to do my best. Like I said, it isn't perfect yet, but it's a step forward.  And, uh... Thank you for asking. It was good to talk about it."

At this late point you should focus on the things you're close to understanding but don't quite understand yet; that's probably going to be the best use of your time. If you fail, then accept that it's your fault for not preparing soon enough and keeping abreast with the material over the semester, and try harder next year. What else are you gonna do, cry forever?  I think that's the answer to your question. People who don't give up don't give themselves the option of giving up."

DecidingToBeBetter,398ily,RGKaizen,19,Wed Jun 10 00:50:56 2015 UTC,I feel like i'm a fairly patient person. My advice from my point of view is not letting yourself perceive every action as a direct and deliberate hinderance to your life. I think empathy has a lot to do with it. You can't see peoples action through your own eyes you sometimes have to see it from their point of view. Most of the time there is a specific reason someone does what they are doing and it might not be apparently clear to you at the moment.  Everyone has been a source of inconvenience to someone in their life at one point or another sometimes you are unfortunately on the end of that annoyance at this given moment in time.

I get it in my head that I need to get all of these things done, not because of any rationale, but just because of how my instinct deals with things.   So, for me, slowing down and being calmer with life (in which requires patience) was to take a step back and realise that, most of the time, this big important thing which needs to be done now now now! isn't actually that urgent at all. And that helps me calm it a bit and realise that i acually have all the time in the world."

At first, it's frustrating - but after a while it forces you to accept someone/something else's timetable, and if you're not going to quietly go nuts in your seat, you turn that frustration inwards and find stuff to do. And then you plan for it, taking work with you, starting personal projects, catching up on reading and movies and podcasts. (Dozing off too, especially if you haven't brought anything to do.)  Good example of patience + action: this guy turned a 4-hour daily commute into a 6-figure publishing career -  http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2015/04/17/mark-dawson-made-750000-from-self-published-amazon-books/ )"

DecidingToBeBetter,399cxp,j367liu,3,Wed Jun 10 04:56:11 2015 UTC,"I think that for making such a conclusion it comes down to two things: actually listening to yourself (through self-reflection) and knowing your own limits (from the experience of at least a decent stretch of days where you make plans and try to put them into action). I'm talking about day-to-day plans here, since big plans can always be broken down to what you do every day to achieve them. If you're just starting out with the whole plan-making/doing thing, I'd say it's best to try to remove all emotion from it: just tick things off when you do them and keep making the plans consistently, don't beat yourself up if you haven't managed to complete the plans. At this point your main objective is establishing your own limits rather than actually completing the plans. That way after a certain amount of time (which will vary between different people) you can establish a pretty good sense of where your limits are. At this point you can but the limits thing on the backburner (they may still vary day-by-day of course, e.g. if you have an overtime day at work, you're gonna be able to do less things at home), and now concentrate on the self-reflection aspect. Say you have a list of tasks for the day, and you've ticked 3/4ths of them off. Then, in the evening, just before bed, spend a little time thinking about/writing about how you felt the day went overall, whether you got the most important things for the day done, whether you recall mindlessly ""wasting time"" at any point, whether factors outside of your control had any effect (e.g. your usual train home got cancelled). From such a self-reflection you can conclude whether you did your full best or whether there were things you could improve on for yourself. Maybe you're tired after work, so you spend an hour ""chilling"" and then don't end up finishing some chores by the end of the day, so here you can try to form a sort of mental link along the lines of ""WHEN I get home, I make sure my room is tidy before I sit down in front of the computer."" Gradually you iron out various inefficiencies that are relatively easy to get rid of, form new useful habits, identify any mental blocks you may have not realised were there and try to overcome them."

DecidingToBeBetter,3997cd,QSpeakin,2,Wed Jun 10 04:07:01 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Sounds like you have put a lot of thought into this, and thus you're already headed in the right direction.  You have goals and the steps laid out to reach them the only thing you're missing now is motivation right?  I personally only lack motivation when I lack goals.  But not goals in the traditional sense like you have listed here. So what the hell am I talking about?  So lets talk about school first.  I hated school.  Oh how I loathed it.  I constantly felt like I was in a state of prepping for the 'good stuff' and always one year away from 'the real challenge.'  I just had to get through this boring stuff first!  Nope.  5 years after high school college was over too.  I had just finished my last stupid statistics homework with that terrible terrible software, and now they were telling me I was done.  So how did I get through all the mind numbing, boring, classes? Why did I miss only 2 days in 5 years?  Why did I fail statistics (homework that's why) but tackle it again anyway?    Because my goal was never X.XX gpa.  Nor was it to get a specific degree.  After 2 years of art school, I realized that I really wanted a specific lifestyle.  One that enabled me to do the things I loved.  So I switched to a degree that would get me there the fastest, based on average pay, and I followed all the advice of alumni that had done it before me.  Whenever I had to take a class that I hated, I thought to myself ""WTF am I doing here? How could this possibly help me?"" and would then try to visualize the most riduclous scenarios that it would be useful.  Taking class example and applying them to my own little personal theater in my head of what 'working life' would be like.  It made the boring a little more bearable.  However, after college and getting my first job (goal accomplished) I got fat and lazy.  I watched Netflix all day after work(I mean seriously, I finished Scrubs twice, Naruto, BSG, House, etc), ate out for every meal, and didn't care about my body.  My wife started to notice (and mention it) so I tried to get myself to work out.  I wrestled and ran in high school so running seemed like the best start.  That lasted 3 weeks.  Why? Bc !@#$ running.  That shit is hard and took a long time and hurt and who cares about running anyway!  How did I ever do this in HS? (turns out I had a state championship wrestling goal in the back of my mind lol)  I tried lifting a few weights, but hurt myself and agitated old wrestling injuries and quit that right away too.  Then I remembered how I trudged through school.  If I could find something that REALLY mattered to me, but required a more physical body to do it, that would put this boring stuff in the middle.  A required, not awesome stepping stone between me and absolutely awesome things!  Since I needed to loose weight and shape up, I started looking into things that required good physical health, I love to travel and had always wanted to be an explorer, so I looked into expeditions and how to get started and found a course that takes you to Alaskan glaciers to learn how to live on the ice and climb mountains!  It was 8 months away, and completely awesome and totally crazy to imagine myself doing in my current state.  Running and exercise and diet all still sucked, but with every miserable mile, when I was ready to stop, I thought to myself ""what if I'm the one holding everyone back because I learned it's ok to stop just because I'm tired?"" ""What if, because I walked up this hill, I'll won't be able to summit the mountain?""  ""What if, because I eat too much now, I'll starve to death and cause my expedition members trouble by having to dispose of me?""   I couldn't shake them.  These thoughts of failing at my REAL goal made the desire to be lazy seem so fool heartedly.    But you know what?  Sometimes I'd get to a point where I'd question my 'REAL' goal too.  And that's fine, because I have a LIFE goal that drives that as well.  These super awesome things only serve as awesome stepping stones to an even more awesome, ultimate goal: to be an interesting father one day.  If I want to do that, I better hit my awesome goals, and I want to do those I better get up off my ass and finish studying the difference between で and ので (I had to learn a fair bit of Japanese for my last goal :P).    Anyway, that's my extremely long winded brain dumb on how I motivate my self to exercise and study everyday (though, full disclosure, I'm not studying at the moment; I've shifted that part of my day to learning how to cook due to completing the goals that required studying Japanese).  What/where/who do you want to be in 5 years? How do your daily goals get you there?  If you skip them, will you not be that in 5 years?  Will random TED videos get you there (which they might, if your goal is to be someone who has intellectual debates with intellectual friends in the pub once a week!)?  Will lifting 250lbs enable you do that?  Or would it instead enable you to enter a specific competition you always dreamed about?  What I'm hoping you'll do is look beyond these goals to find your motivation, because I think it will help make these goals easier!    Good luck! Hope you get better soon!"

I use something like this: http://zenhabits.net/the-one-tool-you-need-to-lead-a-balanced-life/  Your impulse for reflection is great. Use it to get perspective on what actions you want to take next.   Personally, when I'm in a rut, I usually start with the physical stuff. Whether I clean my apartment,  exercise, or plan to eat better this week, it gets me an improvement I can see and feel. The rest depends on what you want to do next."

DecidingToBeBetter,398xsy,EricParkerr,2,Wed Jun 17 16:37:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% if this will be helpful at all, but the rapper MOD SUN wrote about this concept in his book Did I Ever Wake Up called the ""dresser."" If you're ever feeling down. Just picture that in the inside of your mind there is a dresser. When negative thoughts arise open the bottom drawer of the dresser, put all of the negative thoughts inside it, and then slam the drawer shut. Then go to the top drawer. When you open this drawer, all of the things that you love come pouring out. For me it's music, reading, hiking, running, memories with friends and family, ect. If you can redirect your mind to the positives in your life, you'll be able to make those negative thoughts and feelings of being down disappear. If you're in control of your thoughts, then you're in control of your emotions.   As far as relatives passing, it's never an easy thing to deal with. What really helps me with that is focusing on all of the good memories that I have with that person and even thought they may be gone now, I feel blessed to have been given any time with them at all. I sort of picture it as a gift of sorts.   When it comes to the confusion of what you want to do, I think it's important to realize that we're all participating in the collective human effort and we're all still learning the best way to deal with things. If I've never seen a car before and I use the car until the oil runs and I destroy the motor because of it, it's not necessarily my fault. It's just that no one ever bothered to sit me down, and teach me that cars need oil changes in order to run. What I can do is learn from the experience and change my behavior in the future. When you think about what you want to do, just start making a list. You can always add things to the list later, but try to start with the basic things that you want to do right now. Then focus all your thought and energy on that goal. It will help you not only reach that goal faster, but in my experience it will actually help eliminate feeling down because you'll be so focused on your present goal. Anyways, I hope this sort of helped out!"

I don't know if I've ever found a way back to my old friendships, but at the same time, I'm not sure if I want to. See, I keep thinking and telling myself that hanging out with them, I was happier in some ways. Maybe that's true, but maybe that's just nostalgia. Was I really happy or just less miserable than I was by myself? See, when I was overweight, in a dead-end job, I a dependent relationship, I was miserable. Being around those people, going out drinking and forgetting my life, I was happier than I was in any other moment of my life back then. But was I happy? Maybe, maybe not. I didn't have much in common with the people I hung out with aside from being around them so much (and maybe media tastes), but did we have anything deeper?      I don't much enjoy going out as much as I did; I mean, I do still love grabbing drinks or going out to the club from time to time, but most of the time, I would rather do other things I think are fun. I love playing capoeira; in my old friend group, no one would understand that or want to participate in it with me. I love making art pieces, my old friends loved talking about one day being able to make art pieces (when they had more time). I love reading about math and programming and science and philosophy and religion; I'm not sure if anyone in my old friend group would even care to want to understand some of the concepts in the articles I read now.     What would I do with my old friends? Would that make me happier than I am now?       I think I've personally decided to build new friendships; although it's hard and it takes time. I just don't feel that who I am now would appreciate those same friendships; I feel who I am now wants something more and deeper in my friends.

A simple example, let's calculate the resources footprint. Is that guy successful if he is using a lot of resources just for him? The planet is the home of everyone, not just him. A quick and dirty argument? Himself alone on the planet, with all the money that he can imagine, will do quite nothing. He, and everyone else, needs the others to reach certain objectives, so he should respect the home of everyone of us.  Therefore according to the metric 'having money' he is great, for the metric 'having a sustainable footprint', meh. At the end is the metric of success that matters, and that one is decided by you. Personally whoever is widening his footprint having good feelings (i.e: I'm successful!) in the process does not deserve too much recognition, it is just like someone that is destructive and nevertheless, due to lack of awareness of this society, is even envied around."

Financial wealth looks nice on paper, but it doesn't mean he necessarily has a better life than you.  I can share a bit of my story. A good friend of mine and her husband earn over 200k/year between the two of them, have a huge house, two very expensive cars, two kids they keep clothed in all the finest name brands and spend boat loads of money on trips, cruises, vacations, you name it. I have known them for about eight years and at many times I felt envious of them, especially after my husband left my daughter and me, taking 75% of our income with him.   So I decided about 18 months ago to work on my level of gratitude toward my life. I began a process where every day I would write down at least one thing in my life I was grateful for. A roof over my head. Something funny my child said. Something nice someone said at work. Something nice I did for someone that made me feel good. Having enough change in my pocket to buy a Diet Coke. Little things like that. It didn't take long, but I started to see my life for the good that was in it...I may not have a lot of money, but I have a lot of what REALLY matters. And now when I look at their grandiose life, so much of it seems so superficial and meaningless.   I don't keep that journal any longer, but I still feel like I have everything I need and then some. My lights are on, I have food in my fridge, my kid is happy, and I have wonderful people in my life. I've been abundantly blessed in so many ways. Would it be nice to be rich and have more things or do more things? Sure. But I love what I have now.  tl;dr Write a journal of what you already have in your life that you're thankful for, and focus on that, instead of comparing yourself to others. :)"

Thanks for sharing :) I've been going through my own personal revolution over the past few years, and as a person in my late 20s with no kids or real responsibilities, I have a lot of respect for someone like you who has a family and major responsibilities in life, and is still able to face discontent in a brutally honest and courageous way instead of escaping. Kudos to you.  I think we all struggle with what you're now going through, no matter our age or life situation. It's tough to control deeper level emotions and our conditioned reactions to them. Even if we believe in an idea and know that, at their core, our reactions are wrong, it's still hard to let them go.  I'd encourage you to seek to understand what's happening when you feel these feelings. There must be a reason why you believe one thing consciously, but when confronted with a tough situation, your emotions and thoughts say differently. A good way to better understand this is to be with your thoughts and emotions in a silent place. Meditate on them and try to understand what's happening in your mind. Try to do this without verbalizing it too much. Just watch your mind work. Eventually you'll see the root of the problem in your mind and, through understanding, be able to remove the conditioning that is a result of years of unconscious living.   I'm working hard at this in my own life. It's tough, but it works. Good luck. Be happy :)"

We've saved for and gone on some affordable vacations and same can be done for your family and with everyones input it can become a vacation everyone enjoys.  Same with everything else in life, I could care less about getting the latest gadgets bc I make sure what I need I already have.  I strengthened friendships with people that are positive and like me are looking to be happy.  Now when I see my  cousin I can just have a conversation with her because our lives are so different but I like it that way."

This is also called ""downshifting"".  http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/living-with-less-8-reasons-to-embrace-the-simple-life/  Got a large TV? Give it away. Got a tablet and a PC? Give one away. Got 2 cars? Try getting along only with one.  You may find that you are happier with less things. Possessions always carry a certain burden with them.  If you want to spend money considering investing in experiences instead of things. Experiences stay with you for the rest of your life and enrich it, while possessions usually slowly fade away and are forgotten.  I noticed than when I gave up my high-paying job, gave away lot of my things and move into simple living conditions that I had a much more satisfying life. For one thing I had to work less hard to earn a living and secondly I noticed after a while that I became less materialistic, less attached to having lots of or expensive things."

I know this isn't necessarily what you wanted to hear but buying things priced cheap off craigslist, going to thrift stores or yard sales and selling it for a lot more than you bought it for can be a great way to get that money. Ive seen people say they make a living just doing that only. Others who have a job saying they make an extra 20,000 a year or even more. You can still decide to be better and change your ways of thinking, and start flipping as a side ""hobby."" Extra money is always nice. Just dont stress too much about it. You are who you' say you are, not who others say you are. If you accept things from your brother-in-law, he doesnt own you, because you are a man and you say he doesnt. You feeling that way will reflect that."
DecidingToBeBetter,38zykd,Throwaway9797971,4,Mon Jun 8 06:21:35 2015 UTC,"Humility comes from the motivation of not wanting to seem pompous or full of oneself; passion comes from the motivation to do something that one finds fulfilling; self-discipline is a myth; stealing is wrong.  I don't understand why you steal, but stealing doesn't make you a bad person.  If you understand that what you were doing was wrong, it's indicative of corrigible behavior.  Remorse, it seems, often provides more motivation for people to change than anything.  It shows that you might feel empathy; as an exercise, whenever you get the motivation to steal again, imagine if someone were thinking of stealing that thing from you.  How does that make you feel?    Before I move on, I'll ask: are you remorseful because you understand that what you were doing was wrong, or are you sorry only because you got caught?    Importantly, you were caught before it had a chance to get out of hand.  If you do know that it's wrong, simply don't do it anymore.  It's a matter of motivation.  You're not lazy, you're not passionless, you don't lack ""self-discipline.""  You lack the motivation to get off your ass and do something.  You seem smart, you just did some stupid shit, and that stupid shit was the result of your brain searching for something: adrenaline, difficulty, seeing if you actually could.  Whatever it was, realize that there was a motivating factor behind it, something that drove you to seek something from the act of theft.  You can mold that motivation and change where it leads you by finding other avenues for it manifest.  You're not weird for wanting to pursue a career in animation, and you're lucky to have parents that support you in it.  If that's what you want to do, pursue it and let it consume you.  Find ways, actively pursue them, that allow you to do it.  If you come up with excuses, it's not important to you.  Find something else, something constructive.  When someone says, for example, that they ""don't have the time,"" what they're actually saying is they're not willing to make something a priority.  They lack the motivation to pursue something because their excuses have overcome and outweigh their motivation.  And they often come off as whiny, semi-professional victims - in that nothing that's happened to them is directly their fault.  But this was.  Don't let it consume you.  Don't let it become who you are.  Use it.  Learn from it.  If you want to change, you will.  If you don't, you'll continue down this road, to wherever it may lead.  Do you want to steal anymore?  Either way you go, it's up to you."
DecidingToBeBetter,38zykd,crickhollow,3,Mon Jun 8 13:58:56 2015 UTC,"Try following the path of understanding why you steal. Most people feel like there is something unsatisfactory about their life, and it creates a kind of empty place. So, they try to fill it in with something that helps them distract themself from the real issue. Some people fill their hole with drugs, or alcohol, or shopping, or stealing, or food. Others fill it in with work, helping others, reading, religion, exercise, etc. Whether the salve is seen as a positive or negative pursuit, the empty place is still there.  Most people cannot figure this out on their own. Even the most insightful people often have a blind spot when it comes to their own ""stuff."" So, I suggest getting into therapy. It's not about being a better person, really, though this subreddit frames it this way. It's about feeling more at ease in your life. I suspect that your desire to destroy things further, is really a desire to be reborn, like a phoenix rising from the ashes.  The good news is, you don't have to burn things down to get there. You just have to ask for help from someone who can serve as a guide. You don't just have the potential to be a more complete individual. You already are complete, and just need to discover it for yourself. It's up to you if you're ready to do it. You reached your hand out here- now go the next step and reach out for someone who can really help you find your way.  May you feel safe and protected! May you be truly happy and deeply peaceful! May you appreciate your life, just the way it is right now in this moment! May you be free!"

DecidingToBeBetter,38xi2y,cheese_on_toast_,8,Sun Jun 7 18:05:05 2015 UTC,"I've been undergoing CBT with a therapist and handbook since October. I also had most of the goals you listed. My advice to you is this, you may reveal the deeper reasons for why you do what you do, and it may be painful to deal with. Progress can be slow, and that can be good. Habits take a while to replace. In the beginning, I thought I got rid of certain bad habits right away and thought my progress was super quick. It wasnt, I was just temporarily motivated. Your stress coping habits take time to change, and you won't be able to determine progress till the next time a stressful thing happens to you.  Forgive yourself when you fuck up recipes or spoil food. It can take many cycles before you get a recipe down with ease. It can take a year to learn to really cook. I've noticed that I fuck up recipes 3 times before I get it the way I like it.   When you attempt to organize, it is easy to get started when you are motivated. Hard to finish it when you are feeling overwhelmed. My therapist gave me a rule of picking 15 minute projects at a time, per day. Sure, you can do more sometimes, but make the goal the attainable one.   With relationships, your friends are used to you being distant or socially lazy. They will not realize that you are trying to change. You may propose to meet up when they are busy or had a prior engagement. Don't take this harshly as rejection. Plan something ahead of time so that they can schedule it in. If folks decline, don't be upset with them or feel rejected. Try to reach out a few times over the course of time and center it around activities that they are interested in. When you see them, be a good listener, ask them about their life and give them genuine compliments.  KEEP A JOURNAL to track this. I used my cbt worksheets to practice, but my real journal where I was super honest with myself was a video recording diary app on my phone. Use a mechanism that works for you.  Good luck!"

DecidingToBeBetter,38xi2y,muthmaar,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:01:37 2015 UTC,"Muthmaar, it is not the same as a gratitude journal. It is more like thought pattern tracking, an accountability log of reporting what happened, how it made me think/feel, and reporting evidence that backs up (or refutes) my concerns/anxiety, and then plans for the next time. Some of it entails cognitive restructuring or evidence finding.   If you want to do CBT worksheets, some of them which are like journaling (thought pattern tracking), there are some great workbooks (Mind over Mood) as well as free worksheets online. The workbook helps explain the worksheets and gives sample of how certain people filled it out, how their worksheet content changed over time, and what progress looked like for them. This helped me get over the, ""this is stupid"" feeling - I really understand thru examples.  This place has great worksheets that I printed and used: http://psychology.tools/download-therapy-worksheets.html  I hope this helps."

When he was growing up he was handed everything on plate and very similar to what you described. When we got together I was the complete opposite - not a lot of money growing up so had to work really hard and also didn't have much family etc.  So naturally we butted heads over this a lot. I could never stand his laziness and lack of drive and he didn't understand why I was so obsessive and always working. Long story short we balanced each other a lot and learned so much from each other. I decided to just let him be whoever he wants as I would advise most people to be... In the end he set his focus on some personal goals (like yourself) and like I say turned his life around. It was slightly different because his confidence was crippling and he was dealing with anxiety etc but if you ask him he was ""inspired"". He used moodgym a lot andbit think that helped him find his own way?   Either way, he's very happy and content now with a very different life and has just scored his dream job."

Where after two to three years of not entering a gym, I joined an small local gym over the colder months to maintain my regular exercise requirement.

What I love about this is how it provides a sort of framework and demands the motivation to get it done. The beneficial take away for me is to set longs term goals that way a few years on you can look back and smile with the outcomes.  I recently lost a girl I loved dearly and am currently a week with no contact. Ive accepted that i've not yet accepted that I must move on but im okay with that. The pain is minimal and Ive neer been more focused. I also plan on learning krav maga in addition to my other fitness hobbies such as weights and mountain biking. Good luck man!

I've actually put off getting into a new relationship because I don't think it's right to be with a girl as long as I know that I'd drop her in a heartbeat for someone else. But, I'm getting better. And I feel like by having new life experiences as a result of the breakup, it will simply become a point in my path rather than the defining feature."
DecidingToBeBetter,38sn0d,PlatonicBro,2,Sat Jun 6 14:47:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I've also been putting off dating. Now is the time for self growth. You must learn to love yourself before you can love another. And you wont be over her and neither will I. What matters is we learn to accept the situation and look at it through less jaded eyes. Its not an end, rather a new beginning. I finally have motivation to get back in great shape and then stronger than Ive ever been. I have new hobbies and am more focused in my professional goals.  There is always a brighter side to life you just have to look for it.   Also I think you should reevaluate whether or not you simply drop everything to take her back. It would be wise to give some serious thought now and in the hypothetical event on what you need. I ponder the same things. But I also know how she hurt me and cast me out. It would take some serious effort on her end I think. Regardless try to keep those thoughts of her to a minimum and focus on yourself.

I have her email, phone number, and facebook, and she has mine. If she wishes to be with me or even to be friends, she has that option. I still don't know why she broke up with me, but I know that I can't change her mind. So my options are to either wallow in despair or work to make a future even better than the one I'd imagined with her. For the past 7 months, I've thought of her at least once a day and feel physically ill whenever I hear the text tone I'd assigned her number from another phone out in public.

Recognize the significance and the accomplishment in taking small steps and let yourself feel proud of those, because they genuinely are accomplishments. Successful people also had to take these first steps - everyone who's run a marathon has also had the first day where they couldn't even run a quarter mile.  (Also, of course, recognize that depression is a medical condition. Seeking medication and therapy can help give you the mental energy to focus on other things.)"

Will being productive give you lasting satisfaction or will you need to find something else to do afterwards to prevent yourself from feeling depressed again? Must you always be more productive or equally productive throughout your life in order to be happy? Does satisfaction come from external things or internally?  And then examine your lack of productivity and de-motivation...  Why are you not doing the things that you think you should be doing? Is there some inner conflict?   Maybe it's the things themselves... Are the things you're forcing yourself to do actually worth doing or important?   Productivity isn't the end goal. Work has no inherent value. When you are focused and 100% believe in the importance of what you need to do, the actual doing is easy (think disaster/survival situations, or anything that HAS to be done). It's when you are conflicted or don't believe in your mission that taking action becomes difficult.  Examine your motivations. Find the right WHY, create alignment in your life, and then focus on doing the next thing you have to do. Don't get caught in a trap of punishing yourself because you aren't acting the way you think you should, that doesn't do any good. Use everything as a learning experience."

DecidingToBeBetter,38lztx,izwizard,2,Fri Jun 5 18:23:18 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, friend. I wish you the best of luck. Be careful how much faith you put in society's answers to your questions. Watch how many people in society live their lives and see if it really makes sense. Are they acting out of love or fear? Are you acting out of love or fear?  As long as you're acting out of fear (fear of not being good enough, or not being respected, or not surviving, or what others think), you are vulnerable to the outcome of your actions and your satisfaction is dependent on a multitude of external influences that you don't control. But if you do what you do because of an inherent love (either the love of the act itself or love of the benefactors), the outcome no longer effects you and your satisfaction. The satisfaction is inherent in you and what you do.  Don't get me wrong: I'm not telling you to go find what you love to do or find your one unique passion in life. There probably isn't one amazing thing in the universe, that once you find it, life will be bliss. That's another external pursuit that will just leave you feeling incomplete. When it comes to 'what' you are doing, you do have to believe in it and know that it has value, but the biggest part of happiness/satisfaction/fulfillment is how you live your life every day regardless of what it is you are doing.  It's easy get caught up doing the things that society rewards and sacrificing peace and happiness in the process. I am a recovering over-achiever who did this for a long time. But, to a certain extent, the things people subject themselves to in our society are all part of a game that you can choose not to participate in. (And to the extent you have to participate in it, you can do so knowing it's all a game, which helps.)  I hope this message finds you well. I don't know where you are at in life, but maybe you're ready to start questioning these things. If not, and you think I'm crazy, that's fine too. Either way, best of luck with your path forward.

Giving up is never an option cause it doesn't ensure that the bad days will end it only ensures that the days will never have a chance to get better.

Unlike other self help books, it really addresses the tough aspects of life head on and gives you a framework for dealing with the world.   One of the fundamental aspects of the road less traveled is facing reality openly and honestly, and using your experiences to learn and grow. I've found meditation to be essential in the development of my own understanding of the world, peace of mind and well being. After all, how can you understand the reality around you if you don't first understand your own mind and how it works? It's your lens to the world!  So I'd highly recommend you pick up Mindfulness in plain English and commit both to finishing it and meditating for 1 month. Just go into it with an open, relaxed mind and don't expect or try to achieve any results. Best of all this book is freely available online and PDF downloads can easily be found.   After reading both those books (and only after), you might be ready to read ""the first and last freedom"" by krishnamurti. It's a book that will make you question everything you think you believe and really lead to insights (when paired with meditation), but only if you are ready for it.   Good luck on your journey."

I haven't read all the highly acclaimed self-help books, so I can't suggest how those titles compare to others. However, if you're looking for a book with a title on the other side of the spectrum of absurdity, might I suggest:  You Can Be Happy No Matter What ~ Richard Carlson and Wayne Dyer  Behind that awful, cheesy title is a very unique self-help book.  It changed a lot of my perspectives about my mind, my self, my life, and the way I viewed other people's personal, subjective experiences. I go back and re-read it at least once a year, because while it talks about things that I think we inherently know... I personally just need that reminder to look at things a bit differently from time to time. Connect some dots that I hadn't thought to connect in my daily experience.  The only negative thing I can ever say about this book when discussing it with friends is, well... the title... and that it sometimes seems a bit ""self-help""-ish, but it seems that's kind of what you're looking for in this post. This isn't a book about the ""power of positive thinking"" or ""fake it till you make it"" (though they make mention of those methods). Instead, it offers that fresh perspective on what thought is, where emotions come from, and to what degree we all allow our experience to define who we are. It's not so much ""let me tell you how to improve yourself"" as it is ""let me help you understand yourself"". It was a good push in the right direction for me, and I hope it can help you on your journey through the universe, as well."

It also sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to become something without knowing exactly what that is. I know this feeling from personal experience and it's tough to deal with.  I'm not going to give you practical advice and I know that there is a good chance that will turn you off since you are seeking expedient results and perceive that time is ticking. However, it is in your best interest to use your current situation as an opportunity to learn about yourself and the reality you belong to. Examine your internal conflict, confusion, and self doubt. Find your own answers. External answers will temporarily heal your wound and give you results, but unless you have deeper understanding as to what is happening, you'll soon be in the same situation again, looking for a new set of answers without ever seeing the bigger picture.  Why do you want all those things you mention (to be more, to be in control, to be self employed)? What are you really seeking?   Is it realistic to think that you can someday be in control of every aspect of your life? If not, what do you have control over and will that ever change?   What is it about being mediocre that is so distasteful to you?  If you are forcing yourself to do something and still not doing it, do you actually want to do that thing? Do you want to spend your life forcing yourself to do things?  Have your other accomplishments in life and attempts at becoming something ever given you lasting satisfaction? If not, what happened? Do you see a pattern?  I hope you find some value in thinking about these questions. It's easy to get caught in a trap of seeking fulfillment and satisfaction in the future. In the process, we become our own worst enemies and make ourselves miserable. Then, when we finally arrive, the satisfaction we sought for so long proves to be as fleeting and temporary as every other moment. Then we go back to the drawing board.  True satisfaction can only come in the here and now and has nothing to do with how you compare to the world around you. It has everything to do with being who you are and enjoying what you're doing. You won't see this behavior reflected in society, but then again, how many people live happy lives each and every day?   I hope this message finds you well and wish you the best in your journey. No matter which path you take, just pay attention, watch yourself, and become a student of your own mind. Watch the recurring themes and habit patterns, and see if you can start to understand what's happening. Eventually you'll find your own truth because you're discontented with the way things are (which is the first step). Just stay honest with yourself and never stop questioning. Good luck and be happy :)"

You'll need goals to work towards to give context to the self examination in the journals. No one can tell you how to succeed, because the answer is a tautaulogy, ""do the work."" If you aren't doing the work, find out why, and come up with a game plan to be more successful in doing it. There are absolutely no shortcuts, you have to do the work."
DecidingToBeBetter,38mv2p,kerokerokeropi,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:23:00 2015 UTC,"Additionally, you will have to prioritize. One of the reasons you don't achieve what you want might be because you are doing things that aren't related to achieving your goals. Find out what you are spending your time on, and get rid of everything that doesn't align with your goals. Spending time with friends is good, and a must for some people, but you have to limit that if that's what's preventing you fro studying.   Second piece of advice is to start slowly, and adopt habits rather strict regimemens. For example, instead of studying a chapter each night, what's more important is studying for a given amount of time each day. Even if it is just 15 minutes at first. Build a streak that you don't break. Look up Jerry Seinfelds method of building a streak for the reasoning behind this. If you have goals related to working out something as simple as going running x times per week, even if you don't have time to do the full run, or if the distance you can run will be low, the important thing is to still go running anyway, because you want to train yourself to stick to the habit. Another goal can be ""I will do at least on push up per day"". Once you find yourself in push up position, it will be easy to go ahead and do more. But always do at least that one pushup. I know people that literally have one pushup per day as a goal for themselves."

You could find one in a good location, a bigger city, that you would be happy in. Definitely, if you decide to change your degree, look at other options. Don't limit yourself to one particular program if you know you're not going to be happy in that place.  Also, have you looked into the design programs at your current university for example? Or what about marketing or something that goes hand-in-hand with design? (Obviously marketing is the business side rather than the mechanics, I know.) Are you happy with where you are and dissatisfied with the degree or do you want to leave? Have you talked to an academic advisor at your current university? (I'm also American, not sure which country you're from. I know the higher education system is a bit different overseas.)  I think what it all boils down to is what you want and what you realistically see a future in. I'm definitely not going to be one of the ones that tells you to put studying above everything else, because relationships can be very important. I've also seen them be very inhibiting. It all comes down to you being honest with yourself about both the future of your relationship and where you feel it's headed, along with what is more important to you and what you feel like you need to be successful. We all define succes in different ways. For me, succes is definitely tied into my current relationship. For others, succes is tied more into their studies. For one of my friends, succes is purely measured in how much she travels. (She wouldn't stay in one place for a relationship, for example, while I may.) You should sit down at look at how you define succes for yourself and what a successful iteration of your life might look like. Then, work back from there.   My opinion, based off of nothing else than a few Internet paragraphs from a stranger, is that you should definitely change what you're studying. You're not too far along and you're already feeling burnt out in regards to biomedical engineering. You won't loose much time and you won't be stuck in a field of study that you aren't passionate about. Not even passionate, just psuedo-interest is enough if you aren't able to find something you're passionate about. (Not everyone's passionate about things they can study / make a viable career of off when they graduate, which is 100% okay.)"

DecidingToBeBetter,38hsym,Bofonic,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:38:02 2015 UTC,"When I first began undergrad, I was a biology major with the hope of going to Med School. After the four semesters struggling through chemistry and organic chemistry, I realized I didn't want the path I choose, but I had no idea where to go. My third year, I took an anthropology class, and fell in love with the field, but was hesitant to change my major because what type of job can you get with an anthropology degree?   I finally decided with a flip of a coin. It sounds ridiculous, but hear me out for a second. I said heads = bio major, tails = anthro. And I threw the coin up in the air, caught it, and paused. I asked myself ""What do I hope it lands on - heads or tails?"" This was what I truly wanted to happen, and that's the path I would choose.   I was hoping it would land on tails. I put in the paperwork the next day, and as a second-semester Junior, I began taking introductory anthropology classes designed for freshman. It was a struggle to graduate on time, but I managed, and not once have I regretted this decision.  I never looked at the coin to see what it would say. I just slipped it back into my pocket without looking.  Now, I'm not recommending that you decide what to do based on a coin toss, but you need to think about what you really want. If your relationship with your girlfriend is meant to be, you two will figure out a way to make it work regardless of if you're together at the same school or apart. Talk to a professor in the major you are in now to get an idea of what the upper-level classes are like, and see if they align with your interest. Just because the other university is in your hometown doesn't mean you have to associate with the people you already know - I am sure there are others you can become friends with, especially within the major. College was by far the best 4 years of my life, but the second half of college was far better than the first half for me. I had the same group of friends, and I was involved in the same activities, but I was finally studying something that fascinated and motivated me. I was excited to go to all of my classes, and did an independent research project with a professor that I presented at an international conference, and eventually that project helped me get into graduate school.   I hope this helps some! Good luck!"

DecidingToBeBetter,38hifw,electrifiedmeatloaf,2,Thu Jun 4 06:28:17 2015 UTC,"I have yet to meditate for more than a few minutes at a time.  The level of focus it takes isn't somewhere I'm at yet.  But speaking from general experience, anytime you're more calm and centered, you're far more likely to take things in stride.  When you're energy is being used to be spiteful, or sour, that's energy that could be used for other things.  When you center yourself, you are more in balance with everything and aren't ""leaking"" energy that way.  So you are more able to deal with things that might stress you out if you were already in a negative mindstate.  That sounds awesome, keep it up!  There are a few good yoga sites for pose explanations if you're new to it and want to start incorporating that as well.  Vinyasa is the most common, and focuses on breath, so it's almost like a moving meditation.  Only difference is you will have to put more energy into the getting the poses right, to start, so take your time to figure out proper movement, and it will become a more meditative experience as you grow with it.  :)"

Now where you begin here is really up to you.  you have to ask yourself how much you are willing to struggle. There is many variations you can take. I would suggest the realistic approach by cutting weed and alcohol to weekends and taking up a sport. that way you not only get exercise, you also gain a sense of community and a group of people ready to kick your ass if you didn't have a good excuse for not showing up to practice. from there you can take it the next level but start realistically first. best of luck to you."

DecidingToBeBetter,38f8yy,CoochQuarantine,2,Thu Jun 4 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"If you want to change a behaviour there's a few things you have to do.  1) Imagine your life 10-15-20 years down the line if you don't change. What does it look like? What kind of quality of life do you have? Are you a bum on the street with nothing to his name?  What are your family relations like? Are you completely alone and miserable? Visualize yourself failing in life because of it.   Why? - Ever hear those stories where people had to hit ROCK BOTTOM before they got their life together? It's because the pain of their current life was too much and they reached the ""Breaking point"" where things FINALLY had to change.  We want to avoid things actually getting THAT bad...daiy visualizing helps trick your brain into feeling those emotions...It's a pretty scary place but that fear and pain can be a POWERFUL MOTIVATOR TO CHANGE.  2) Once you find the appropriate leverage what you need to realize is that each of your vices if fulfilling some sort of need.   It sounds like you're using them to suppress your anxiety or some other issue.   Quitting cold turkey is going to be difficult (but possible) but I'd suggest finding some better behaviours to replace them with and testing them to see if they work. (Go into self-observation mode so to speak)  For instance could you do something else that relaxes and calms you instead of Booze/Weed/Porn? What about Meditation? Taking a morning walk through a park? Maybe there's a playlist of music you could listen to that you find relaxing instead? Deep breathing exercises?   Porn/Weed/Booze create alterations in Mental AND Physical state. Masturbating with Porn releases Endorphins. Maybe instead of doing that you could go running every morning.  Another way changes of identity happen is when we conquer some sort of barrier and show ourselves we can do something we never thought we could!  For some people that's exercising and eating healthier, for other people its financial discipline...something that people consider difficult to do. ""I showed myself I could do this...now I feel like I could do ANYTHING!""  Lastly (for now) many of us have never consciously choose the standards of what we will and won't accept. We float through life just reacting to what comes our way instead of pro-actively taking the reins of our life. If you want a better quality of life you need to start setting higher standards for yourself. And by that actually CHOOSE them and hold yourself accountable and really BELIEVE it with emotion so that it becomes conditioned inside of you.  Write down on a piece of paper the things you WILL and WON'T ACCEPT in your life anymore. From a health standpoint, financial, personal. I also write down the qualities I want to and already possess and a few little incantations.  Things like  ""I will not settle for anything less than I deserve.""  ""Forgiveness is a gift you don't give to others..it's a gift you give to yourself.""  And I encompass it all with ""I choose to be better.""  A better friend, To feel better and energetic, To work harder, To Pursue my goals unrelentlessly, to treat my body better, to treat others better, To try and help others make their lives better.

Pick a place you've always wanted to go that is away from what you know and go there. Or just pick any old place and go there. Ideally leave your laptop behind and get a phone plan that limits you from getting online unless it's absolutely necessary. Only take the bare essentials.   2) Try something that'll get your blood pumping in this new place. Exercise is certainly a must (the endorphins really are powerful), but also do something that scares you. Talk to a random beautiful girl you would normally never think you have a shot with. Tell everyone in a crowded elevator, ""I bet you're wondering why I've gathered you all here today."" Go skydiving, take a hot air balloon ride, go shark diving. Keep it safe but get out of your comfort zone.   3) Keep a journal every day. Don't censor yourself, let out your fears, hopes, desires, pitfalls, or just talk about the day. Let yourself ramble, no one will ever see it but you. Do this enough and you'll start to see goals emerge, long and short. Listen to them, set them, and hold yourself to them. Shoot big but take little achievable steps along the way. Build confidence one small success at a time.   4) Listen to podcasts talking about things that interest you while you exercise, read books by people who inspire you, who make you want to have their life. If you can't drum up any while you're out there PM me and I can give you some of mine.   When you're in the slosh of normalcy and boredom, it's hard to see what's really important to you, and thus what will really make you happy. Get out of your comfort zone though, and you can get a bit of perspective, kind of like getting an arial view. Then with the right diet of information and activity, you'll be able to read the gauges better and have a better idea of which way you want to go.   And then you can set your course, make the necessary adjustments, and admire the views with appreciation for how far you've come and how far you can go."

But first start on listing what your MAIN GOALS are and from there it'll continue growing. I used to only have a ""to do list"" but then it grew on tutorial lists, how to lists, exercise lists (basically  a compilation of information on certain topics so i can get back to them next time). I used to have a traditional notebook but now I use evernote cause I can update/check it as long as I have internet. Having a list of to-do things helps me intensely because i forget things that i need to do. constantly update and check your list. make it a habbit to look at it and DO what your list tells you. i have a TO DO ASAP list and a to do some other time list so i can do them next time when i'm free or bored.tldr start out by making a list on what your goals are then list how you can accomplish them. evernote is a very good app to use"

The first draft of this post was a long, rambling mess and I had to chop out some parts to keep it brief and readable.    First off, he never exactly said no.  Any time I brought up the subject he made arguments against it.  In many cases they were fairly reasonable.  ie. if you get in an accident, I could be held liable. His way of saying no was getting angry if I pushed the topic.  I think the main reason he's against it is because he fears for his kid's safety, and also because he made up his mind and doesn't appreciate being pushed into something he's not cool with.    When I found a bike I wanted, and demanded he help with the paperwork,  my counter-argument went something like ""I made up my mind and understand the consequences, if I don't end up buying it, it will be your decision, not mine.""  Whether or not it ruins the relationship will probably depend on what happens in the following months.   Buying the bike - he'll get over it in a few weeks or days.    The positive outcome would that getting back something I love will be a major contributing factor in pulling me out of this depression.  Our relationship will improve when not being depressed = doing better at work and being more involved with family.  Even if he never sees the correlation, he'll be happy.    On the other hand, if it doesn't work or only works for a little while, I'll probably end up going back to the US.  I've been putting a half-hearted effort in his business, and absent from the family, then there's the bike issue.  I'd leave him feeling burned and understandably so."

After that's done the other person has to try to articulate how the other person is feeling without being bias to their own views.

Now that I've written that, I do think the idea of sociopathy as a spectrum is interesting, but is this current psychiatric theory? I had always read you either are one or you aren't, and to talk of non-sociopaths as having similar traits of sociopaths is to confound the idea of a sociopath.   In other words, a single trait at any given moment (""I really went for it that time, just focused and kept my eye on the prize, not like me at all!"") can be viewed as a moment of confidence and elan, or it can be seen as a ""sociopathic trait"" from some spectrum. I am not sure this is helpful for anyone.  I'm also not sure it's helpful to simply demonize sociopaths/psychopaths and say they are ""inherently bad"" or a bane on society.

DecidingToBeBetter,38b9wm,thesylo,2,Wed Jun 3 13:05:27 2015 UTC,I admire your desire for self improvement. If you take the assumption that our society is well-designed and functions well then your position makes sense.   Let's say we put that assumption down for a second. Instead of focuses on the individual for a second. Let's put the overall system in focus instead.   Can you not see that if you look at the situation from a different perspective that it simply demonstrates that the structure of our society is unsuitable for purpose?
DecidingToBeBetter,38b9wm,Level126,3,Wed Jun 3 13:25:02 2015 UTC,"If you take the assumption that our society is well-designed and functions well then your position makes sense.   No, my belief doesn't require that assumption. Mostly because I don't hold it.   Like all people, I think society could be better. But functional psychopaths running society is nothing new, and it's not merely a byproduct of current systems.  My aim is understanding why people in power are in power, not justifying it. I think this is important to understand because if you want to change society, you need to first know how power is created and maintained (at both an individual + group level).  For example, I wonder how Bernie Sanders or Rand Paul would rank on the psychopathy scale. Though they are individuals who want to ""change society for the better"" - in their own different ways - they are also supremely focused, ambitious, non-conforming, and have the social skills and social charm to gain significant followers."
DecidingToBeBetter,38b9wm,ScheduledRelapse,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:45:49 2015 UTC,Society does not have to be well designed.  It simply has to function for a long enough period to be something you have to give a fuck about.  Society doesn't have a purpose.  You might have a purpose.  I might have a purpose.  Society is just the sum of the actions of the collective.  There is no head on this beast.  Society is not a Titan so much as a Hydra with 7 billion heads and counting.

Click this for your education: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16492104  More stuff: Psychopathy is a collection of social dominance, cold callousness, and impulsivity. Social dominance is also a socially valued part of extraversion. Cold callousness is mean, but is also related to making more money on certain types of economics problems. Impulsivity can be risky, but also high reward.  Tada!"

I had always read you either are one or you aren't, and to talk of non-sociopaths as having similar traits of sociopaths is to confound the idea of a sociopath.   There are indeed psychologists who conceive of ""psychopathy"" as a personality trait that lies on a spectrum. And there are tests designed to measure these traits in a normal, non-clinical population. See: Psychopathic Personality Inventory  You should...check out the book. :)"

Trait theory is actually one of the more dominant theories in personality psychology these days.  If you can conceive of autism on a spectrum, with ""functional"" on one end and ""nonfunctional"" on the other, I don't see why a similar spectrum can't be applied to psychopathy.  To be clear: saying that there are ""functional psychopaths"" doesn't downplay the seriousness of ""criminal psychopaths"" anymore than saying that there are ""functional autistics"" downplays the seriousness of ""nonfunctional autistics."""

Popular notion isn't law in today's day and age. We live in an informed age. Sure, 20 years ago if a psychiatrists said ""oh, ya know we've done a lot of research, and there's absolutely NO in between of male vs. female."" In that case, maybe you'd believe them because it was the mid 1980's and no body was informed about shit. Today, you don't have to take a psychiatrists word. It's like, do you think sexuality is binary? Do you think gender identity is binary? Do you think preference of chocolate vs. vanilla is binary? Do you believe in the autism SPECTRUM? I challenge you to come up with any trait which ISN'T a continuum. Its simple biology. Even something as simple as blue vs. brown eyes. Even if two people have blue eyes, they don't look EXACTLY the same. You can believe an old out dated model that lots of old shitty psychiatrists believe, or you can simply try thinking   ""But the psychiatrist! they spend their whole lives studying human behaviors! You MUST believe the psychiatrists! They know all and have all of the answers!""

Who honestly beleives in the idea that personality is binary? It's just absurd. It's like saying ""well the popular notion is black people should sit at the back of the bus, all the psychiatrists say that they are fundementally different from white people, so it's cool.""  If a physicist tells me I'm wrong about the mass of an electron, I'll probably take his word for it because I don't have the tools necessary to measure the mass of an electron. If a psychiatrist tells me something that I've SEEN and EXPERIENCED is wrong, I'm not going to beleive them. Psychiatry and actual science are pretty far apart from each other. One is COMPLETELY subjective, while the other is kind of subjective."

I got tired of seeing people being praised for being assholes to their friends and family (or even worse, complete strangers). The herd mentality, the elitism, the almost cult-like behavior... once I took a step back, I realized that I did not want to be associated with those people.   Obesity is unhealthy, and it is a growing problem in the world, and it is something that should be addressed in today's society... but that subreddit is not a productive means of combating it.  I've got a new rule about posting things online... something I ask myself before every submission: If I were to be doxxed, would this ruin my life?

And it was tiring reading a thread and it was like a pissing contest, oh, I eat this, and I do this exercise! So far as posting pics of yourself to show how fit you are, how much better you are. I never got to that stage. But there was a little voice in my head who said 'what the fuck is this?' I've never been taken in by the hivemind before.  And you say about if you were doxxed, would it ruin your life? This isn't my real account. This was just one so I could hide out of fear of me being doxxed. I seriously doubt anyone who knows of me on my real account would believe that I would think such vile things. I speak out about the racism and homophobia and sexism and transphobia on there, but it's all a waste of time if I come somewhere else in secret because of how someone looks.   One thing to get my head around was I work in healthcare so I do see the effects of obesity, and I do see how it affects other people. So somehow in the poisoning of my mind I used that to justify looking at these posts. But hating them isn't going to change their situation and it won't help the obesity crisis.

It will take specific mental effort to retrain your brain to stop hate and ridicule from being your go to response to these people. If you're looking for advice, I'd suggest that when you see pictures of or meet the type of people who used to be the targets of your hate and you catch yourself lazily going through a list of insults in your head, actively stop and use your conscious mind to think about something else relating to them (e.g. empathy for their situation, hypothesize barriers they face to getting healthy, etc.). You could also practice positivity by visiting weight loss subreddits and encouraging the people you see who are working hard to loose weight. Its hard to retrain your brain if you're surrounded by people who make hateful jokes about other people all the time. Maybe if you stop responding to their jokes, they'll start to get the hint that their lazy, hateful humour doesn't do it for you anymore.

If you managed to have a great time in high school, you must be a fun person!  I can definitely understand the situation you're in now.  I'm a very closed person and rarely let people see any side of me.  I only talk when spoken to.  Yet I have a small group of friends I'm very comfortable around, and I've made a few new ones since leaving the old highschool.  The easiest and most logical way to make new friends is through mutual interest.  Do you stand for something in life?  Is there a cause you're fighting for?  Find people to rally around.  Work your way down the interest spectrum through passions and then to hobbies and then to mere interests.  You should be able to reach out to lots of people around you.  This is essential for me because I don't even talk to people if there is not some basic connection we have.  Secondly, I believe in trusting your intuition when it comes to making friends.  Sometimes, you want a friend so bad you can wind up getting involved with the wrong group of people, and that's not okay.  Take your time to find out who you are really comfortable around, and who will be your friend in bad weather.   I am afraid ill lose all my friends or they just won't be interested in talking to me anymore   Unfortunately, people always leave our lives, even when we don't want them to.  However, true friends will always be around.  Even before the age of the internet, my dad managed to keep in close contact with his high school friends.  So far, I've done the same.  The people that truly matter will always be there for you as long as they are breathing!  Don't forget that!  You probably know all this, I'm just trying to make sure you know that there is no need to be afraid. Unfortunately, I don't know of any books on friendship. If you need someone to talk to, I'm here.  Hopefully you make lots of good friends.  Be fearless!"

However, I will be bold, if responsive at all, because I value life moments like this very much and appreciate their gravity. When approaching a world with so much gravity I have to say first to let the truth set you free: nothing matters.   It doesn't matter what you do. You can stay or you can go. Either way you will die. Your boyfriend will die. And that job you have has a hundred million iterations that are as expendable as The Man finds people like you and me. Eventually, the Milky Way will collide with Andromeda. Doesn't matter. However, I have always found that when I start from a place of no meaning then I find within myself the resolve to create it. Why the hell not? I am, am I not? I am free. What is stopping you or me from pursuing our dreams? Fear. Fear of the unknown is the actual motivating factor. You fear because the world is legitimately dangerous and you're a very frail creature in the cosmic scheme of things. However, with great risk comes great reward. I never understood everyone's fascination with the ""meaning of life."" It is to live. And you're gift and responsibility is to own that life and make something of it. Make a life so enlightened that they write your name in the stars a hundred thousand years in the future. You get to choose. It is a blessing and a responsibility.   The choice is always before you: comfort or risk. Ben Franklin was right when the said that ""[they] that give up a little freedom for liberty deserve neither security nor liberty."" (paraphrase)   Nothing matters so it doesn't matter what you do. So what are you gonna do? Beat your head against a wall or make art? Personally, I have always found that following your own desires is a nice way of feeling validated but you gotta be brave. Ecstasy and passion never came to the lethargic or indecisive.   This may all be gibberish but I find in your struggle my everyday struggle. Do I get warm in the cave or take my chances on the outside? Well, I've found that the sun is much warmer and much more dependable than a manmade fire.

I'm too comfortable here   I see this sentiment all the time and I think it's a terrible idea. Would it be better to inflate your raft while you're on the beach, or while you're in the deep ocean, being circled by sharks and spending all your energy trying to tread water just to keep breathing? Being under stress doesn't make things easier. The ""I'll be better/happier/more productive when..."" sentiment is just a trap that you use to excuse yourself for not making progress now.  You're afraid to apply for jobs? Good. I've been afraid just before every single good thing I've ever done in my life. I remember being terrified just before telling my boyfriend that I loved him as a teenager. I was terrified on my first day of university. I was terrified while sitting in my car, deciding whether to go in to my first roller derby training session or just drive away. Now I'm married to him, in an excellent career, and had a ball playing roller derby for 6 years (pretty damn well if I do say so). Being afraid is a good sign, you just need to bite the bullet and do it anyway.  The good news is that you can build the life you want, any way you want it. Draw a picture of what your ideal life looks like. Maybe it involves a career in animal husbandry, seeing friends twice a week, a sporting activity you enjoy, a strong relationship with your SO, and occasional travel. Maybe it involves a string of part time, entry level jobs while backpacking, WOOFing, and just getting by, and hardly seeing your friends at all, and not having a SO. You've just finished a degree and you currently have employment. You've got brains in your head, and feet in your shoes. All doors are open to you. If you want to spend more time with your friends, call them up and make time for them. If you're not sure about your SO, talk to him, maybe take a break, or maybe work on 'dating' again. If you want a different job, find one, find out what it takes to get it, get those things, and get the job. It's your life, you can have it your way. Design it. Built it. Live it. I felt exactly the same way you did a few years ago, so I drew a picture of what I wanted my life jar to look like, made a list of things I wanted to do, made a plan, and am living it and I don't feel that way anymore. Be grateful for these feelings you're having right now. Some people won't get them until they're 80 years old and it's too late to do anything about it."

I only do things when I have no choice essentially, that's what we've discovered about me. I have social anxiety so the fear is just for everything, and the only way to do things is just to make myself do it. I have a job at the moment so that's what's stopping me finding a full time one, if I had no job, then I would have no choice. But I see where you're coming from, it doesn't mean it's going to work, I appreciate that."
DecidingToBeBetter,38azeh,jelliknight,2,Wed Jun 3 03:02:58 2015 UTC,"I have a job at the moment so that's what's stopping me finding a full time one   It's not really stopping you though, is it? You're sitting on the beach saying ""I'll blow the raft up later, when it's much more difficult and when I'll have much more dire consequences if I don't succeed right away. It's all this oxygen and being able to stand that's stopping me from blowing it up, when I'm sinking and my head dips underneath the surface of the water then I'll really have the motivation to blow it up."" Seems pretty silly when it's put that way doesn't it? You can find a full time job right now, if you want, you just don't want to because it's difficult. I'm not trying to be disrespectful, I understand where you're coming from and this is something I've noticed in myself. When I say ""I don't want to do that right now, I'll do it later"" I have to make an effort to remind myself that what I'm really saying is ""I'd prefer to do this task when I have less time, more stress, and it's significantly more unpleasant.""  which isn't really true at all, it's just me trying to lie to myself so I don't have to do the unpleasant thing right now. All the good things in my life come from fighting that urge to delay or avoid something until it's an emergency, most of the bad things come from giving in to it. I'm saying this because if you've found out that you tend to avoid things unless they're an emergency, creating emergencies every time you need to get something done isn't a real solution. Working on doing things before they become an emergency is a much better long-term solution. It's harder too.   I think we all have a little social anxiety, we all have to fight the urge to stay in our comfort zone and force ourselves into unfamiliar situations. We just fake it, and it gets easier over time. Remember that anything you can do when you're in the deep end, you've been able to do all along.  I think you're far more capable than you give yourself credit for. Take the harder path and prove it to yourself."
DecidingToBeBetter,38azeh,gouldf,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:32:11 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between everyone having a little social anxiety, and needing to take medication for it. I don't think you quite understand the difficulties. I do think it's silly to make emergencies out of everything in order to do things, but it really isn't as easy as just moving out of my comfort zone and trying to do something. But the real problem for me isn't the job thing which we seem to be focusing on. Either I am where I am now, looking for a full time job, or I'm staying with family in a more interesting place and looking for a full time job, and the other just seems more interesting, as well as there not being a whole lot of opportunities where I am. I know I have to push myself and find one, I just think I'd rather do it somewhere else is all I'm really trying to say."

Here's my routine  Water - wash my face then drink a full glass to wake up and hydrate  Meditation - clear my head for 5 mins  Affirmations - read some inspirational stuff aloud for a minute or two  Visualization - think about goals, both short and long term  Journaling - plan day, note things I'm grateful for  Reading - 20 pages of something non-fiction  Exercise - 30 minutes of cardio   Food - good healthy meal to start the day. Usually an omelette  This takes me an hour to do the full thing, but adds a lot to my day. If you don't have an hour to spare in the morning, go to bed an hour earlier ;)"

DecidingToBeBetter,387eq6,MicahBaby,2,Tue Jun 2 11:37:40 2015 UTC,"I'm having the same problem now - I'm a grad student and I work part-time, and I have much more free time than I'd like. I'm also newly single, so I'm in a transition stage in my life. Here are some things I've done recently that have helped -   Working out. I've seen this advice all over reddit (especially once you break up with someone - the whole go to the gym/delete facebook/lawyer up gag), but honestly, woking out has been the best thing for me. I try to go to the pool and swim laps for 30-45 minutes at least 3 times a week before work. It's super helpful because not only does it keep me busy, by the time I get to work I feel more motivated because I've already accomplished one goal of the day and I want to keep that momentum going. I'm also starting to tone up and lose weight, which definitely helps the self-confidence. Just this morning I looked at myself in the mirror after I swam and I'm already seeing changes in my body. It's really awesome when you start to see your body look better. Cooking. I love to cook and eat. Since I'm trying to become healthier, cooking allows me to eat better than I used to, and I'm learning a new skill! Last night I made parmesan chicken stuffed shells, and not only is it delicious, it was a fun way to spend the evening. And I have lunch for work for the rest of the week :) I've also had friends over and have made dinner for them, helps me save money by not going out on the weekends and allows me to try out some new recipes. I'm trying to figure out a way to compile all the recipes into one area so I can go back to them in the future.  I don't know about you, but during the school year I don't have time to read for fun. So now that it's break I'm catching up on all the books I wanted to read over the past year. In the past month I've read 2 books (almost finished my third!). I'm also trying to read a mix of fiction and non-fiction. I've always been interested in the Founding Fathers, so I've got biographies of Jefferson and Madison on my reading list, but I also have Game of Thrones too! Mixing things up helps me stay interested in reading, and it allows me to explore interests that I don't get to explore in school.   I was a little overwhelmed at first with the amount of free time I have. There are so many different things to do, and I had no idea to begin. I spent some time thinking about activities that I would enjoy, but that would also improve my life in some way. Swimming is fun and gets me in shape. Cooking has always been a stress-reliever for me, and it also helps me save money and get in shape. Reading allows me to relax and take my mind off work, and allows me to keep the mind active while not in school. I still have some nights where I lay around and watch Netflix, but overall the changes I've made have really helped me grow into the person I want to become!"
DecidingToBeBetter,387eq6,wizard_82,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:03:50 2015 UTC,Find a hobby that makes you learn. Learn how to build a electronic circuit. Learn to make soap or sew or start a garden. And join a club with similar interests :)

Work on a car, woodworking, taxidermy. Whatever your interests are or you always wanted to try get started. Clubs are also good for this.  Exercise is another good productive time filler. Join a gym or some sort of team. Or there are lots of things you can do for free. Start biking or hiking.  Or you can also find somewhere near you to volunteer.  I personally love books and reading is never a waste of time to me so if you like reading maybe set up a summer book list for yourself."

My suggestion is to start organizing your thoughts and concerns about uni, your skills with the females, general social skills etc. into smaller, tackle-able objectives by writing them down. Make lists. Why am I not good with the females? Well because (reasons 1, 2, 3, etc). What can I do to improve upon reason number 1? I can a. work out b. eat better c. dress more consciously, for example. Personally, doing this helps me realize that even the biggest problems, which may seem scary and impossible to overcome, are just collections of smaller, simple problems. Just try to tackle a little bit every day."

DecidingToBeBetter,3836zc,sirownski,29,Mon Jun 1 15:03:22 2015 UTC,"Hi, first off, I'm really happy that you were able to avoid suicide. I know I don't know you, but I know how hard that is, so on behalf of the people who know and love you, THANK YOU.  Second, I'm happy that you're trying to find a way to actively make your life better. That's a big first step and it's huge. I'm here to offer you random online stranger support because every human deserves that. You have the power to make your life better, and I sincerely hope you find it.  On to the brainstormy part:  The reason people are big about fitness is because for most people, it's the fastest thing to see results from the work they put in. For any other discipline, you have to go through years and years of suck before you start to get good at it. As a perfectionist you might be familiar with this one. If not there's a decent video about it that I'll post if I find/remember it. With fitness, there isn't as much of a learning curve; it's easier to change your body then your mind. Maybe we can start by talking about the kinds of fitness you like and the kinds you hate. There's so many different options, and not every thing works for everyone, but even something as simple as one push-up a day, or a mile walk will help you find an anchor and make bigger changes in your life.  Based on your comments above it seems like Work/Art/School all occupy the same space in your brain as something you take very very seriously. The good news is that means you have some drive. The bad news is that too much of those things are going to burn you out. It sounds like you'd do well trying to find a hobby, meaning something you're able to take a little more light-hearted. I've started playing Magic on Friday nights because while I like the challenge, it doesn't hurt my self-worth if I'm never any good at it. Are there things like that in your life now? What about cooking? That's another activity with a surprisingly low learning curve.  When I was going through a really dark time, one thing that helped me was that I got really into baseball. There are some days when the only thing I could motivate myself to do is check the baseball scores and read a baseball blog. I say this not because I think you need to get into baseball, but if you can find a daily blog, it might help you knowing every day there's someone out there making content for you. It's something you can start to rely on, and when you get used to the writer's voice, it feels like you have a connection to a real person. It's basically a social crutch, and I'm sure some may be skeptical of it, but it really worked for me. I guess I should send blogger Geoff Baker a thank you letter.  Okay, I've written a novel, but I opened your post and saw it was a ghost town and I just wanted you to know that there are humans out there who care about you, even if they look like faceless words on the internet.  I wish you all the best."
DecidingToBeBetter,3836zc,NormanBalrog,11,Mon Jun 1 17:06:20 2015 UTC,"First things first is to start seeing a mental health practitioner. I know you would like to/feel like you should focus on the other goals you mentioned but working towards other goals will not make much sense if you still feel like you'd rather die. Also, you can discuss these goals with a therapist who can work with you to create an action plan and hold you accountable.   You mentioned in another comment that you might like a pet. That could be a good idea. You could also try some type of plant that you can take care of. They are lower maintenance but you still get to put energy into taking care of something else. Spider plans are good because they can get big and are very low maintenance.  You can PM me if you want more information about the other goals you mentioned. I'd be glad to talk with you more or even be an accountability buddy."

I had days where i wanted to stay in, quit entirely, some runs werent always spectacular but none the less 5 days out of the week I would run because I was determined to make a change. I've held a strong faith that I'm working towards a better tomorrow that some day (through all my work) I will find the life I want. I was and am still pretty much a loner but when I started I tried the whole ""fake it till you make it"" with my confidence and made point to do a bit of chit chatting with cashiers here and there and to go out and about to break out of my comfort zone, despite not having any one to accompany me. I guess I'm just trying to say to give exercise the old college try and to grasp at every opportunity that comes your way, eat well and take care of your body and being a loner isn't so bad. I could have a group of friends at the snap of a finger but their company would only deter me from my goals. Its like all the actions you take today determine who you'll be in the future. To end this its 4 years later and I'm stronger, and more confident, more ""fun"" then I ever thought I'd be. I still have my days where I want to quit, and I'm usually exhausted, but my demons don't rest and I would rather spend the rest of my days exhausted from fighting them off then to give in."

You might have missed the summer deadline, but sometimes missed event are new and better opportunities awaiting itself.   I almost went down that suicide road, but it's not worth it. Sometimes we get so overwhelmed with life that it just seems quick to just end it all. But behind all those dark clouds there is always light. ALWAYS.  Have you heard of Tim Ferriss? He wrote a very touching article on suicide. He does a much better job at telling his story and urging others not to go down the path he almost did. The link is weirdly titled. I think in part so that those who type ""how to commit suicide on google"" can find his page.  http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/05/06/how-to-commit-suicide/  Don't do it.

DecidingToBeBetter,3836zc,LeSpanishRice,6,Mon Jun 1 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"hey I'm not interested in killing myself but I was diagnosed with a terminal illness.  I get down sometimes and here's the stuff that has helped me the most:  My dog!  I got a puppy and she loves me unconditionally. She's always ready to go. Sometimes when I'm feeling the worst she comes and snuggles me, and I can't help but feel better.  Making a schedule for the next day and sticking to it.  This takes a bit of discipline but I try to make time for all my goals.  When you miss something in your schedule don't beat yourself up over it, just remember the 5 things you DID get done and how you'll make a better schedule for tomorrow.  Try very hard not to find yourself alone, flat on your back, with nothing to do.  You can easily turn inwards against yourself.  Go to meetup.com events, volunteer at a hospital or animal shelter, protest something you hate.  Incidentally these are a great way to make friends that share your interests.    Always have something to do handy in case you find yourself in the alone scenario mentioned above.  I recommend podcasts on your phone.  A great one is Savage love. It really highlights how messed up people can be and will have you laughing at the scenarios they get themselves into.   Learn something new whether it's dancing, juggling, blowing smoke rings, sleight of hand, anything that strikes your interest. There are youtube guides for pretty much every skill so that can be very fulfilling when you start juggling 5 balls for example."

I'd also like to bring something to your attention since you enjoy art, there is an Anime that i recently watched that completely changed my outlook on life. It's called Death Parade and if you have time i believe it'd be an eye opening experience. It's in english, you could watch it via Funimation or watch it via Kissanime. I've perhaps had thoughts of suicide but i know myself and i know i would never follow through with it. This series definitely put me in my place.

DecidingToBeBetter,3836zc,InsuranceGuy22,3,Mon Jun 1 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"I tried to kill myself last September. The last thing I remember was being in the woods and things slowly stopped making sense and to this day I have complete amnesia of the rest of the event. I stumbled from the woods and somehow managed to get home, at that point I entered into a coma. The lady from the police slapped me twice as hard as she could to try and wake me. I woke up 2 days later after the medical staff had kept me in a medically induced coma. I'll never forget that overwhelming fear waking up in the hospital, still feeling very confused from the anaesthetic, hallucinating slightly from the medication I had taken having the intubation tube removed. At 26 all I wanted was my mother.  This isn't so people feel sorry for me, it is what it is, you go to sleep and everything and everyone you have ever loved is gone. It's really not something I believe you truly consider when you're in the throes of all of the emotions of taking your own life. My therapist explained that every patient he has worked with only wanted to take a part of themselves away.   I'm so glad you didn't go down that path. You have to learn to love yourself. On one hand, yeah you're not happy with your life but on the other it's a lot better than the vast majority of people on the planet.    Remember life isn't a competition, there's no failure to be feared. In fact at 26 looking back through years of making life hell for myself some of the most important life changing events in my life are probably what people would call failures. I think the biggest failure can be how we deal with these shortcomings and disappointments. Everything is worth doing if you learn from it. Anyway, it's a fear of failure. I think you'd surprise yourself when you really try.  For now just learn to be happy. Find something you love that's not too taxing - I know it's easier said than done with what you're going through, depression can be a fucker. I don't think it's a case of making it through the summer. It's really a case of loving the process of learning to be a human being, an adult and learning how beautiful you really are. Learning to be gentle with yourself and gentle with others.   Depression is (and I mean no disrespect by this) and incredibly self centred mental health issue. Go and do things for others is really the best advice I can give you, take your mind off of yourself and spend your valuable time with others. Procrastinating about your own life is clearly killing you - it's driving you to insanity. Give a homeless person 20 mins of your time and I guarantee you'll make a new friend. Join a program to help lonely older folks, a charitable cause that works with disabled people. Show someone some humanity whom truly receives none, caring about them will quickly take over from your need to satisfy (or not satisfy) your own ego.   Meditate, watch your mind, your triggers. Learn how and learn why, there will be plenty of places you can go to learn. Also places where you can meet other people. It's not specifically a religious practice. After all the prescribed medication and self medication I wish someone had told me 5 years ago that simply watching my mind, taking that time out for 20-40mins a day would make improvements to my own well-being I never thought possible.  Best of luck in the rest of your life you lovely lady."

DecidingToBeBetter,3836zc,soggyballsack,2,Tue Jun 2 02:46:18 2015 UTC,"How old are you? I was in a similar situation when I was a teenager. At 17, I gave myself until I was 21 to be happy. If I wasn't happy by then, I'd off myself. So I know your desparation. However, I'm 26 now and in a much better place. Not that I don't have times where I think my life is worthless...we all struggle with those feelings from time to time.. but I decided before I gave up, I was going to live  my life in an entirely new manner. So, I moved out of state, joined a volunteer program, and focused on my happiness and the happiness of others. Your life really changes when you see that you're making a difference in the lives of others, and in fact, that there are people out there who DO need YOU. So my advice would be to volunteer where ever you can. Most agencies are not going to tell you no. They're so desperate for people to help them, and so incredibly underfunded. I would highly suggest looking into Americorps for something under the Americorps umbrella. I also did not have many friends, and even after joining Americorps, 5 years later , yes I have acquaintances on facebook but didn't make any solid friends.. out of the 150 people that I mentored/volunteered with. Some of us are just different...we're going to have to go through life knowing that there isn't going to be a close friend at every bend, but that doesn't mean that there aren't just regular old people that you can't at least be an acquaintance with or have some fun with. So anyway, I hope that this has helped you a bit. And I hope you give yourself a bit more than just 3 measly months to decide that you're going to just hand the grim reaper your soul free of charge.. you're worth more than that. Fight for it."

There really are so many things that you have to weather in life, that you don't expect. It's an uphill battle and that's what sucks.

DecidingToBeBetter,3836zc,gooddaytodye,2,Sun Jun 7 00:48:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks. For seeking out help and love. For letting us take the time to clear the storm in your brain. Letting strangers like me talk to you about anything. Guys, like you said, start with any stuff. That I'm sure.  3 months alive is where you'll be exactly pass summer. Try  living for your own or more. Be the home for him and acknowledge past failures and embrace new fears. For direction is a struggle you both can overcome together. Had your life ended the 2 men that love you most will mourn for you, for you matter most to them in this planet.   Friends are SOMETHING you can make while schooling. Surely you might nearly missed deadlines but that's something you can work on till August.  It's an attractive option to reward yourself tangibly while filling up your time. Let go of your troubles and don't give too much shits about every imperfection. Not everything in this world is perfect. This one's in the past.  Whatever you make is good enough should you focus on abandoning your nitpicking and completing things first and well after. There is joy in love and passion in working on whatever you feel like despite past insecurities.  It's amazing how any level of commitment can get you results that other people have shown. Putting all of your energy working out can be shitty so choose to deal with what you can so you don't have such a rough time.   For what it's worth, living for the rest of your life is a lost cause. We all die someday. You can stay at home, sleep in your room but try not to kill too much time.  I did consider not really wanting to write this note to you. Despite myself I wrote it anyway and told myself that if I could persuade you to see a lot of things differently we could meet somewhere in the middle. It's Tuesday morning and I replied despite my drive to sleep and my anxiety that what is written will never be ready. I must confess."

A lot of it is that I had Social Anxiety and isolated myself from the world, never feeling comfortable around other people or able to share myself, which results in a lot of rejecting yourself and no self-worth.  Most of what was done in therapy was just me getting used to interacting with another person, getting comfortable sharing my real self, and being vulnerable.  It also really helped me get over my perfectionism because I was able to just accept myself and what I do."

I actually volunteer on another website (which I won't recommend, because you'll meet a lot of other depressed people, and while they might be understanding, they're not going to help you move forward) where I help people going through rough times.  It sounds like you have people who will listen though, and you want to know how to move forward.  I've been there.  I'll admit it.  I was there in December, in fact.  Fast forward 6-7 months, I'm living in Vail, make good money freelancing (being my own boss) and just accepted a job running some of the outdoor activities for a major resort in Colorado (purposefully being vague, I don't need someone tracking me down).    It sounds like you have plenty of good ideas already.  I think those days right after deciding not to kill yourself when you had been in a dark place for a while is like a new lease on life.  You have a blank slate.  Do things that make you happy, just to keep your mood up for a while.  You want to make happy thinking more of a habit.  Bust your ass with work.  It keeps you productive, gives you a sense of accomplishment, and will increase your resources.  SPEND TIME OUTSIDE.  This is huge.  Fresh air, sun, exercise (even just walking) will make you feel a lot better.  EAT WELL.  Putting crap in your body will make you feel like crap.  Being creative can be a good outlet, but do it for yourself, for fun, rather than worrying about the output.  Acceptance is a big part of life, so start by accepting yourself.  There's nothing to compare anything to.  It just is.  Help others.  Being a friend to someone else who needs it can be great.  Hope that helps, and message me if you need to.  I will say, I'm really kind of staying away from negative conversations because of what I'VE been through, and the respect I have for myself and my boundaries, but if you want to talk about moving forward in a positive light, I'm happy to do that."

DecidingToBeBetter,3836zc,YellowCalcs,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:17:01 2015 UTC,"One thing you are missing is the possibility of a chemical deficit in your body. At my nadir I got lucky. I started getting serious muscle cramps and read that magnesium supplements would help alleviate them.   And my mood lightened.   I have a chemical deficiency of magnesium in my body and it is known as a precursor of depression.   So: there is no ""fault"" in you that leads to depression, which is what you are wrestling with.   And depression is a sick little demon that sits on your shoulder and whispers the most awful things into your ear, in your own voice.   For the sake of trying, try to find the cause of your depression, and get rid of it. There is no shame in being depressed, nor is there any shame in being anxious. These are diseases, like flu or mononucleosis. They can be dealt with, they have nothing to do with who you are when the disease is absent, but they twist who you are, using your own brain against you.   Get help for that. Explore all avenues. Talk to the people who can help you, no matter who they are.   Prove all things: hold fast that which is good. <3 Jet"
DecidingToBeBetter,3836zc,jonnileeto,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:52:19 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the encouragement! Did your doctor figure out that you had the magnesium deficiency? Is there something I should specifically ask my doc?
DecidingToBeBetter,3836zc,DarSakhar,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:04:39 2015 UTC,"This was a fluke. I took the magnesium to stop my muscle cramps and my partners said I was much more fun to be with, so I looked around a little about magnesium.   It was sheer luck. Whatever, I'll take it.   Here's a story: a friend of mine's mother would periodically disappear. They'd figure out where she was because in those days people's credit card transactions were easier to access. She'd be in KL, Malaysia; Tana, Madagascar; Durban, South Africa. After a while she would call her home and ask what was going on, and she'd fly back.   She had a boron deficiency in her brain, and what a bitch it was figuring it out.   There is a crystal in their foyer which is boric acid (very mild acid, it's used as an eye wash) and if she touches it every day, the absorption through her skin is enough to provide the boron she needs. That prevents her ""going walkies"" without her knowing volition.   The brain is a funny piece of gear and it can get out of whack from a million different things.   The point of all this is: you might not be experiencing you so much as you, filtered by a little demon that is malevolent. If you figure out how the demon comes about, you can beat that. I got lucky, my friend's mom got help from curious people who were also helpful, others get help from therapy of various kinds.   The help is there, cast a wide net and have heart. You will come out of your place of despair and it will be lovely."

DecidingToBeBetter,385827,matrix2002,2,Mon Jun 1 23:05:47 2015 UTC,"I don't have social anxiety or any other mental illness.   You might. You should go to a therapist and see what they say.   You have something. You know your life is unhealthy and you want to change it, so clearly something is wrong.  Go see a professional.   There is a book about Japanese people who do this, called Shutting Out The Sun.  Here is a story about it.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23182523"
DecidingToBeBetter,385827,blahblah98,2,Tue Jun 2 02:57:25 2015 UTC,"You say that you don't have mental illness or social anxiety, but it's not black or white; it's more like a rainbow, and you're somewhere on the spectrum, and it varies according to stress.  Not to worry too much; (a) your brain is elastic and with focused effort you can get on the gradual road to improvement (you're here, afterall!), and (b) most people have experienced some forms of mental illness at various times.  God knows what I have; my parents are narcissists, I work with aspies (might be on the spectrum myself), I'm certainly an introvert, my kid & sister have ADHD, my wife is more the extrovert but has depression and low self-esteem (Hey! Not my fault!  She's great & beautiful, but she's like ""yeah, sure.""), the list goes on.  Unfortunately humans tend to place such a stigma on it that it's difficult to address publicly.  Thank god for the anonymous internet, eh? ;-)  You'd certainly benefit from therapy & I recommend it, but assuming that's not in the immediate cards & you're looking for self-help assistance, there are certainly things you can do to make your own progress.  And you're correct, if you don't take steps the risks are you'll live a pretty lonely existence and much harder to reach your potential.  So it's in your personal interest to take on your own socialization as a project.    First, your mental status is probably 60% environmental, 40% genetic.  Some of your behaviors you may be able to observe in family members.  It's a positive sign of maturity & acceptance that you're recognizing it now, and seeking to make the first steps towards addressing them.  Read up on ""7 Steps Therapy"" for addicts or abuse victims, or Adult Children of Alcoholic Parents; a similar sequence may roughly apply in your case (check Meetup.com).  Read up on the DSM of Mental Disorders; these are Personality disorders that you can recognize & compensate a bit.  Take the Briggs-Meyers test, and take a Sociopathy test.  These are all pretty standard diagnostics.  Since your history is unique to you, it would require a pretty complex diagnostic to figure out your particular issues.  But you probably have a reasonable feel for what they might be.  So make a list, and start working towards each of your issues via gradually increasing exposure therapy.    Recognize that human existence requires functioning in a social network.  You will need to learn how to comfortably interact with people for work, for services, for health, for entertainment, for relationships.  If you like coffee, head to the coffee shop frequently, and experiment with increasingly bold requirements: work up from a decalf to a skinny half-caff double machiato with vanilla, for example.  You'll have to assert yourself and withstand some sighs & eyerolls, but hey, you're the paying customer, and they offer it, don't they?  Count your change; that's always good practice anyhow.  If they make a mistake, just like you might make a mistake, it's probably that they just messed up, no biggie.  You might tip them more or less anyhow, it's not like they're going to retire on it.  If you understand cash registers, they have to add up the receipts with the cash box; any mistake, and they may be written up or required to pay the difference.    What kind of stress have you been under?  My step-mother the therapist makes the analogy that our psyches are resilient like a rubber band, but if you've already been stretched & stretched, you really can't take much more stretching or it feels like you'll have some kind of break.  You have to find a way to relax, get away from the stressors, get enough sleep, hydrate, eat healthy food, exercise.  These things help relax your stressors so you can be resilient again.  I take it you're an introvert too, are you around extroverts all the time?  There's a few of them at my work & they're constantly texting & emailing me with bullshit distractions & chest-beating bravado; I ignore them most of the time, so they think I'm anti-social.  Fortunately my work doesn't depend on them so I can say ""fuck 'em,"" but if yours did, I can see how that would be continually stressful.  As an introvert, you need to stand up for your right to be alone to recharge your batteries.    There's a number of good movies about mental illnesses, personality disorders & sociopathy.  Have you seen Silver Linings Playbook, A.C.O.D. (Adult Children of Divorce), Nightcrawler, A Beautiful Mind, The Truman Show, etc.?  These can be good therapy.  Ignore the dumb scary/horror/thriller ones, they're exploiting & stereotyping mental illness for profit; that's not helpful.    Well that's a wall of stream-of-consciousness text for now; but welcome to self-discovery, self-improvement, self-awareness, and the rest of your life.  Good luck!    That'll be $150, please.  Just kidding... ;-)"

What do you dislike about them?  Do you feel they aren't on the same level as you in some way (ie. 'I hate dealing with stupid people')?  Also, do you dislike your friends?  What are their thoughts on your dislike of others?  There was a time when I suffered from major depression last year and this caused a dislike of life/people/things I enjoyed previously.  Maybe you should visit your doctor and see if you have a medical treatable mental illness?

DecidingToBeBetter,385827,Speelt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:28:27 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Definitely see a counselor/psychiatrist then.  Contact your local mental health wellness center or look for someone online.  Depending on your income, some professionals offer a sliding scale for cost.  Also, do it now because many have waiting lists (several months).  The idea being that you want to find someone you can talk to that is able to help you figure out the root cause of your social issues.  It can be very difficult to overcome these deep rooted issues, and a 3rd party with experience can help bring those issues to light.  Sometimes just confronting the issues can help you overcome them.  Another idea is - travel to somewhere that is foreign to you such as another city or country, perhaps where the language is different than your own.  I find when I am in another city far away from my normal life, I tend to be more willing to do things I wouldn't do at home, such as socialize at a bar.  Ie. The feeling of 'no one knows me here, so it doesn't matter what I do'.  Good luck."

I've been through a myriad of drugs, therapeutic styles and the usual - meditation, diet, exercise, positive thinking etc. I'm on medication that is helping at the moment, and working through things, but I'm interested in hearing your perspective on developing mental fitness and resilience.

DecidingToBeBetter,380hnl,rynelf,37,Mon Jun 1 00:44:14 2015 UTC,"Anxiety sucks. No question about it. It's totally irrational, and it can really throw you off. One thing I got taught that helps is to recognize it for what it is. Anxiety is the activation of the sympathetic nervous system for that ""fight or flight"" response.  We learn the exact physical symptoms of anxiety. The knot in your gut, the raised heartbeat, the hot feeling, the heightened awareness, etc. And when we feel it, we break it down. ""My hands are getting clammy. My mouth is dry. My heart is racing. These are the physical symptoms. My body is pumping adrenaline. My brain is racing.""  Anxiety is your body hitting the nitrous. It's preparing you to act at an even higher performance level than normal. If anything, it's a boost. As long as you don't turn it into a feedback loop. Getting anxious about anxiety doesn't work. So you feel it, you recognize it, and you ride it.   ""My body has hit the afterburners. I'm aware. Time is moving slowly. My reflexes are at their peak. My mind and body have primed themselves to survive. Whatever task is ahead of me, I'm ready.""  We're trained to have an activation phrase to put ourselves into the right mindset. ""It's go time."" ""Do or die."" Something like that. Then a few deep breaths, a moments pause to connect to our bodies, then perform. I don't know if that'll help you, but it's helped me.  Another thing to remember is that anxiety doesn't have to stop you. ""Courage is being scared, but saddling up anyway. - John Wayne."" Somebody on Reddit taught me that phrase, and I love it."
DecidingToBeBetter,380hnl,Bdi89,3,Mon Jun 1 12:22:46 2015 UTC,"For me, it's more the generalised, free-floating feelings of dread, the cognitive side of it moreso than the physical. Without trying, I sort of freefall into negative thinking and worrying about the future, and worrying about worrying. But I definitely see what you mean about not getting caught up in the feedback loop. It's hard sometimes to disentangle the chicken and the egg from those physical symptoms to the sense of unease about future, this that etc.   Thanks for your advice. I particularly love that quote at the end there. I also like that afterburner quote! Probably not best to use that one when I'm staring at the ceiling trying to sleep haha.   Another random aside - did/do you see much prevalence of mental health issues while in service? I know here in Australia, there is a lot more research and clinical services being thrown at PTSD, but I'm guessing a lot of guys would put up and shut up so to speak, the whole machismo army-guy stereotype. Is that true to a point? I've always wondered.  Sorry to bombard and thanks again."
DecidingToBeBetter,380hnl,kidbeer,8,Mon Jun 1 12:53:24 2015 UTC,"My wife has a similar problem sometimes, although maybe not as severe. I helped her out by having her watch ""Duck Soup.""  ...Maybe I need to explain that. It's an old Marx Brothers movie. There's a scene where Groucho goes through this entire series of ""what ifs"" right before meeting an ambassador. He starts with a handshake of reconciliation, then wonders about if it's rebuffed, and escalates the entire situation before it ever happens. By the end of the scene, he's screaming 'WELL, THAT'S A FINE HOW-DO-YOU-DO! HOW DARE HE!""  Then the ambassador walks in with an outstretched hand, and Groucho slaps him and storms out.  From that point, whenever she would start that same feedback loop, I would shout out ""WELL THAT'S A FINE HOW-DO-YOU-DO!""  It would defuse the negative feelings by being funny, and remind her that she's responding to things that haven't happened yet. Before long, she started catching herself at it. It helped quite a bit.  So... Yeah. Duck Soup.  We're still playing catch-up with mental health. I know quite a few people that are heavily involved with that research and treatment, and it's a struggle in a lot of ways. Slowly but surely, we're getting people to be okay with seeking help when they need it. No one man is an Army on his own."
DecidingToBeBetter,380hnl,Bdi89,2,Mon Jun 1 15:26:08 2015 UTC,"Good call with the defusing. The problem is that even as a cognitive phenomenon, it is very cyclic. For me I am pretty on top of the physical symptoms, but the cognitive stuff can be very deceitful, these what-if scenarios playing themselves out very convincingly.   I like the Groucho stuff. It's so true! That or you get to the actual handshake and realise - 'shit. This aint so bad'.   Thanks again. People view military persons as stone-faced hard-arse people, but I think your training and job actually help foster some calm attitudes. Like, it could always be worse, being disciplined etc. Sorry if that sounds like a generalisation - it's a compliment haha."

If you're anxious, you're anxious about something specifically.  Nobody is ""just anxious"".  If it feels that way, it means you aren't catching yourself thinking about the thing that's making you anxious.   Sarge mentioned ""flight or fight"", which is great.  Anxiety is a defense mechanism.  ""What am I defending myself from?""  Thinking of it that way is very helpful.  Anxiety is for fighting off an assaulter or running away from a lion :)"

Hey, look at that bad scary life stuff. Be worried so you can get comfy and avoid!"

Since when did we only have to do the things we ""want"" to do? I don't want to. Great. So what? Do it anyway. I lower the threshold. If I don't want to do my workout, I just ask myself to start it. If I still don't want to after starting, I can stop. Getting started is the hardest part. I set a timer. I don't want to study? I start a pomodoro app and study for 25 minutes. It's not a long time, and I usually end up continuing after the timer goes off. I break it down. ""Clean the bathroom"" is a huge task. ""Wipe the sinks"" ""Swiffer the floors,"" ""spray down the shower,"" etc, are all small tasks. They're less intimidating. It helps for long ruck marches and runs too. 12 miles is forever. ""To the top of that hill"" is attainable. I make a reward conditional. Instant gratification is a sneaky enemy. If I decide not to do something I don't want to do, and do something I enjoy instead, I'm rewarding myself for quitting. Didn't work out today? No tasty cold beer for you at dinner. I don't beat myself up. We all slip up. I didn't perform the way I wanted to today? Ok, do better tomorrow. Beating yourself up just makes you avoid the task, since you don't want the guilt."

DecidingToBeBetter,380hnl,Chromatic8,45,Mon Jun 1 00:26:53 2015 UTC,"Undisciplined to disciplined...  In my personal experience, it's a matter of constant improvement. Just trying to do a little better than yesterday, and learning and evaluating your own performance. Setting goals and challenges for yourself. Breaking down your failures, and trying again. Some people might be constant successes, but I failed over and over until I didn't.  A typical day: My alarm goes off between 0400 and 0430 (I've got one of those sleep cycle apps.) I make my protein shake, brush my teeth, review my schedule for the day and meditate for 15 minutes. Then I have a light breakfast, grab my lunch and work clothes (prepared the night before) and go to the gym. I do my workout, shower, change, and go to work at 0730. As soon as I get to work, I sit down and write out a list of the major tasks to do today. Then as I finish the tasks, I scratch them off the list. I can usually do a full day's work before lunch. At 1000, I have a second breakfast. At 1300, lunch. Work ends at 1630. I go home, and take care of the household chores (I use the chorebuster site. It's awesome.) Then I sit down to study for my classes. Every week, I break down the assignments so I know what I need to have done. Once that's done, I relax for a bit, have some dinner, until 2000. Then I make sure my clothes and lunch is ready for the next day, and do something relaxing away from screens until 2100, when I head to bed. Weekly, I make my meal plan, study plan, and account for extra activities on my schedule, like charity events, or my weekly trivia nights.  I rarely have to panic and do stuff last minute, I have the flexibility to do fun things if they pop up, and I sleep great. I feel healthy, I look good, and I don't have things hanging out in my brain bothering me. I have the time and the mental energy to dedicate to whatever I'm currently involved in."

I get them outside and do morning PT with them. I drive them through their tasks for the day. I guide and advise what to eat, and give them 10 minutes. I make sure their day is so chock full of training and activities, that they have no choice but to push their limits. I stress them. I force them to face their fears and do the thing anyway. I force them to work together and work through the personal issues they're going to have living in close quarters. I don't accept excuses and whining.   By the 2nd month, their bodies learn. They wake up on their own. They tuck in their chins and drive forward when they feel ready to quit. They've learned not to dally, to use their time well. They sleep like the dead whenever and wherever they can. They don't accept their own excuses. The push and support each other, closer than family.

Some other person asked me to provide proof, and I did this. It can be good enough for you or not. At the end of the day, I earned my hat, and I bring an attitude of actually trying to make BCT what it's intended to be to every cycle I work.

DecidingToBeBetter,380hnl,BaboonRockFighter,10,Mon Jun 1 01:45:30 2015 UTC,"I do. Different personalities respond to different motivators.  It's less what they are, than it is how they see themselves. So a person that sees themself that way is looking to be validated as such. They think they're smart and that they could perform well, but they need to be recognized and challenged.  I make them my mouse. Every basic platoon has a ""house mouse."" One of the recruits is placed in charge of cleaning supplies and such. I give them the key to the locker, and they make sure the toilets are stocked with TP, the mops are clean, etc.   It makes them feel like I see the potential in them. They've been selected above the others to do this. Giving them this extra responsibility triggers loyalty and a desire to please in those types. Now they have to prove that they're worth the extra trust.   Once you've given them that ""recognition,"" they'll go to hell and back for you.

It bugs me so often in the civilian world that ""training"" is this slapdash mockery of the institution of learning.  It's an insult to methodology and practical exercise.    In the military, training is an established, formulaic process - ""Here is the task, here is the goal, here are the tools, here is the method to use the tools during the task to achieve the goal.  Now go do it yourself.""  It is flat out the simplest way to take someone who doesn't know has never heard of the task before to completing it with competency.  In the military it works from the proper execution of a push up, a salute, the proper exit of an aircraft mid-flight, disassembling a rifle, repairing a satellite relay, setting up a field antenna, administering an IV.

Half of our problems we had were issues with cohesiveness because people put their perceived needs over the good of the group, and in the Army, they punish you as a team. Don't do stupid things, hold your teammates accountable, and be a good example that other soldiers can follow.

It's not easy, but it's worth the investment.  You also have a lot going on. I'd find some ways to simplify. Take the struggle out of your decisions. Find a few good recipes you know everyone loves and will eat, and make sure you have those ingredients. Most people go to their mainstays anyway, and it takes the struggle out of the choice. Get rid of a bunch of clutter. It makes it easier to clean. You're getting pulled in a thousand different directions, and that gets you nowhere.  Take a few minutes, and figure out one important thing you want to do each day to progress. As long as you get that one thing done, it's a step.

But you can always get better at how you manage them. There's always room for improvement. Try new things, see how they work. If it works for you, use it. If it doesn't, don't.  I know arthritis responds well to regular exercise. Autism responds well to a set schedule, so does ADHD. For hypersomnia, look at your sleep quality.  Those things are probably never going away, but you can get a little better at managing them. And the only real goal is to be better than you were yesterday in some way."

I could apply for a commission, but I don't want to. Too much paperwork, meetings, politics, etc. When I start medical school, I could ask the Army to pay for it in return for service as an Army doctor, and I'm considering it."

USAG/USASF Certified and my wife is a Physical Therapist and Occupational Therapist.  That being said. The best way to stretch and stretch quickly is Neuromuscular Stretching or PNF.  PNF  Make sure to stretch everything every morning and before you go to bed. Doesn't have to be super intense but just make sure you are stretched out a good amount.   I prefer to do Pandiculation  Hope this offers some help. If not I can give you a way more in depth guide depending on what you want to stretch.

We both do it, and were both unhappy with ourselves which really did a number on each other.  I wish I would have just put in more effort to actually plan dates and fun things rather than complaining about never doing anything fun and not acting on it.  She told me if we broke up again it was the last time, and honestly I'd be mad at her if she let herself be with me again :/.  That's not to say I dont wish it would work, but after all the damage weve caused each other it just isnt fair to anyone.  I'm realizing now that I put way too much pressure on her to fill voids in my own confidence and life, and that isnt right.

When you catch yourself feeling jealous, insecure, dissatisfied, etc. acknowledge it and respond differently than you normally would. Ask yourself, ""why am I feeling this way? Are these feelings based in my partners shortcomings? Or am I unhappy with what I'm contributing to this relationship?"" If you're the one that's falling short, take that observation and do something with it. Be patient with yourself and give yourself time to process your feelings before reacting and self-destructing.  Also, I find that when someone puts me on the spot to come up with something to do I usually draw a blank so I keep a list in my phone of date ideas that I can refer to."

I had some shit in my past that would creep up on me and get me down and it was like I was drilling a hole in my own head.   This is what worked for me - get up, move, go for a bike ride, change your frame of mind.   Thoughts and emotions are pathways, they become a habit and you need to work to retrain your brain to 'not go there'.  Its like quitting smoking or anything else, it takes work.  Its like learning a new emotional language.  It will take a while and you will have to make a solid effort to avoid thinking and dwelling on the negative but it can be done.   Don't watch 'downer' movies or listen to much anger, don't watch Jerry Springer and ease up on Fox news, ease up on heavy metal and dark music.  Take in uplifting stuff, positive messages, motivational things. Get lots of exercise, do other things that will make you better, take a ceramics class or photography.  Stay busy, don't sit still, whenever it creeps in get up and do something else.  Yea it feels weird going out of your way trying to be happy, at first it feels like some sort of con of a joke, like your trying to trick yourself.  Yea I miss my gothic music and my Slayer and the horror movies and all that but when you get all that out of your head (garbage in garbage out)  Listen to classical music, go for walks, volunteer at a homeless shelters, go out of your way to be nice to strangers, work at it and after a while your not faking it and one day you realize it's become a self fulfilling prophecy."

DecidingToBeBetter,37zcgw,HaddonH,6,Sun May 31 19:49:18 2015 UTC,"I was there, looking back I realize that some of the things that were put on me a kid were wrong.  How did adults / parents think all that was ok?   You'll never figure out why it happened.  You'll never get 'closure'. You'll never make them understand what they did or how much it hurt.  The most you can do is become a good person and keep moving, stay busy, busy, busy and you won't have time to think about it. One day you'll say ""I'm  a good person and it's their loss"".    It took me a couple years of actively working at it but I can go weeks or months with out thinking about it or falling into that hole where you just dwell on it. Your brain is just another organ in your body, if you drink to much you'll fuck your liver, if you work out your muscles will get bigger, brush your teeth and the'll last longer.  Do right by your brain and it can heal and you can put it past you, it will still be there but you won't think about it much and one day you'll realize your happy.    It can be done, if you get stuck write me.  Been there. But first, stay busy, fill your head with nice and it'll soak in.  Worst case scenario is you never get out of it and then you start doing to others the sorts of things that happened to you.  That's when you move in permanently into your own private hell.    Take classes, volunteer, get exercise.  Again, if you get stuck write me. It'll take you a couple years, be patient and understand that it'll take a bit. If, when you drink that sets you off, don't drink.  Shit there are whole cities I don't go to because they are to full of memories.  Keep at it, it takes work."

DecidingToBeBetter,37zcgw,Feelngroovy,3,Sun May 31 19:46:25 2015 UTC,"When I was 8 years old,  I was raped for 4 months by my oldest brother. I was an easily pissed off little kid before that, but after, I just let it consume me. I either couldn't care about you, hated you, or was so enraged I'd attack you.  The person who raped me was a minor, so he didn't go away. He went to JVC for a month, then a home for ""troubled youth"" and came home on the weekends. I would constantly fight with one of my brothers to keep from killing the oldest.   This continued for years. My parents were religious and I eventually read the Bible,  leading me to believe I was possessed by demons, was going to hell, and shouldn't be allowed to live. I attempted suicide a few times and would hurt myself to surpress the rage.  Eventually decided it was all nonsense, which rediced the suicidal desires.  Fast forward to 15. I had left school for 2 years because I had nearly gotten expelled for violence. I was homeschooling myself and was able to skip a grade. In 10th, I couldn't teach myself certain subjects, so I went to the local high school. There met Angel.   Angel was the happiest, most loving, and compassionate person I had ever met. I hated her like I hated no one  else. What the hell was so great about her life that she could be so fucking happy all the time?! Turns out, not a damn thing.  Angel had 6 younger brothers and sisters. Her oldest sister was 7 years younger than her, all of them were from her mother's second marriage. Her dad fled because he couldn't take her mother's extreme bipolar, exagerated by her alcohol habit. Her New step dad was a pill addict always high on pain killers perscribed to him by pill pushing doctors. He was very abusive, she would have to get home early and goat him into beating her so he got it all out of his sysyem by the time her siblings got home.  Her family survived on government assitance and selling her step dad's extra pain killers. Her parents weren't capable of taking care of children, so since the age of 7, she had to be mom. Aside from going to school, she did all the cooking, cleaning, helping with homework, shopping, and anything else that required responsibility.  This was her life, and she was the happiest person I had ever met. It boggled my mind how anyone could have a life like that and still manage to be a happy, loving person.  You want to let go? Get grateful. Angel was and is grateful for everything in her life. There were even moments when she was grateful for her step dad. She is the most amazing person I've ever known because despite everything, she chose gratitude, happiness, and love.  For myself, I truely forgave my brother by finding gratitude, appriciation, and understanding.  Be grateful you have lived your life and all that's happened in it. And remember, you can always choose to smile."

DecidingToBeBetter,37zcgw,VibrantKai,2,Tue Jun 2 13:54:05 2015 UTC,"A few things will help - one is to understand where anger comes from. Anger is very useful because it shows you where your needs have not been met. It is usually hiding a deep sadness or fear.  It is the thought you tell yourself about the unfairness or disrepect of the situation that is making you angry, not the situation itself - this means that something happened where your need was not met... Ask yourself what was that? Was it safety, being listened, respected or loved? etc....  When this happened or you think about it again, another thought flashes into your mind that says it was unfair or horrible BECAUSE............ and this is what is making you angry.  You can use this anger to have your needs met in the future. It might be a good idea to find a safe and super private place where you can SCREAM and let it all out, and punch a bunch of pillows............ I'm not even joking! It will help.  Next thing, is to use the emotional freedom technique. Also called EFT Tapping. It is profound. I have tapped for thousands of hours on myself and with clients - because it words profoundly. I highly recommend you trying it. You can do it by yourself or you could follow along with youtube videos. Of course with most things like this it is best with a gifted practitioner, of which there are thousands of practitioners in The World now, so you will b able to find someone who resonates with you...  Rather than getting angry at yourself for getting angry - this makes it stick. There is a process used in eft, which I liken to emotional alchemy. When you accept you feel that way, let it move through you, express it, lean towards it, understand it AND send it love - you will shift the feeling. If you want to know more feel free to PM me, moving emotion through is one of my greatest passions because not many people know how to do it properly. But it's actually real easy....   But truly, the only way out is through. So find that safe place to accept your anger and let it out, while focusing on what need wasn't met and you might eventually find yourself in tears. This is healthy and will also pass, but don't fight it. It is trapped energy aand crying and anger happens for a reason."
DecidingToBeBetter,37zcgw,Feelngroovy,2,Sun May 31 20:09:04 2015 UTC,I definitely know where my anger is coming from.

You have power over him being older and his stepfather and your thoughts and actions have impact. Children are able to detect these subtle indications better than people think, whether one tries to hide it well or not, and that can affect how he behaves around you. How he acts around and towards you can be a reaction to how you display yourself towards him, and so it cycles.  Have you been mentally evaluated by another therapist or a psychiatrist? It sounds as if you may have intrusive thoughts, especially if you don't mean to have them like you say. Cognitive therapy could be a starting point to look into.  It's possible that you may be projecting as well. Were you anything like him as a child? Or made to be hateful of or afraid to become someone like him as a child? Or perhaps conditioned to not be all the things you think he is? For example, parents that push their kids to be athletic out of fear that the child will become fat will overlap onto the child's mindset and may cause the child to react negatively to children who are fat, as if they aren't trying as hard as they are. Do you project your own insecurities onto him in such a way? If so, it may be good to start there and resolve these ingrained issues that you may have. Question why you hate fat people, people you deem ""stupid"" (whether they are disabled or not), ugliness, failure, etc. When you start to unpack this kind of thinking, your perspective on him, others, and yourself may change.  EDIT: The way you loop thoughts about all the negative things you see in him over and over only encourages you to become less and less empathetic towards him, thinking of him as only a thing to hate instead of a person with feelings and thoughts he may not be able to effectively express due to age, disability, self-consciousness, or abuse. Especially towards someone overtly or covertly hostile to him. Be conscious that these hateful thoughts will happen and that you cannot always stop them, but you can be aware of them when they happen and challenge them."
DecidingToBeBetter,37x0bu,junkbait,7,Sun May 31 05:58:13 2015 UTC,"thank you for saying this. Im not projecting i dont think, but what rings true is this:    Have you been mentally evaluated by another therapist or a psychiatrist? It sounds as if you may have intrusive thoughts, especially if you don't mean to have them like you say. Cognitive therapy could be a starting point to look into.   The thoughts are definitely intrusive and unwanted, reading about intrusive thoughts on wikipedia and it sounds like i should see a professional."
DecidingToBeBetter,37x0bu,BreakMyLimits,3,Sun May 31 13:23:53 2015 UTC,Everyone has intrusive thoughts at some point.  It's being human.  But like the person above I recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as it'll help to change those thoughts.

DecidingToBeBetter,37x0bu,DrewNumberTwo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:04:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, I went to a therapist for it. I've also seen of people do it themselves through self-help books and apps. Usually people who use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy are people with depression, anxiety, phobias, BPD, DPD, suicidal thoughts, self-deprecating thoughts, etc. so the material may work towards helping those problems more, but I can imagine it would work for people with hate and anger problems as well."
DecidingToBeBetter,37x0bu,RRightmyer,35,Mon Jun 1 05:06:31 2015 UTC,"There aren't a thousand reasons that you hate him. There is one. You think that your wife fucked up, and he's the fuck up. You wife might have fucked up by having a kid, but that's an action, not a person. The kid is not the mistake. He's just some poor shit with a step father who is borderline abusive, and a shitty mother who married such a guy. It's no wonder the kid seems a bit off.  Do everyone a favor and get divorced. Hopefully the mother isn't too much of a fuckup and can be a better mother to her son."

Which will this kid benefit from more: a single mother or a supportive set of parents?  If it's possible to change the way you act towards him, it is an infinitely better choice. A possible way of going forward is making yourself build a relationship with him. Make a mandatory weekly or even daily time to be with just him, separate from your wife. It could even be going for a drive or a walk, or running an errand. His development will be hugely impacted, and I imagine that it will be much easier for you rather quickly."

Include what you'd like to hear them say. Sign it from them. Read it and imagine it in their voice.   In the same way that marketers have discovered ways to create positive associations with a brand, researchers found that this method can resolve negative associations. Intellectually, you'll know that person didn't write the letter. That doesn't change how your subconscious mind processes it.   It sounds like a tough spot. Hopefully he grows into a fine young man. Maybe if you're able to overcome this, you can help."

Usually people hate people for a valid reason, like they did something horrible. This is only a kid who hasn't done anything other than being unique and looking ""fat and ugly.""

DecidingToBeBetter,37x0bu,Adfero,2,Sun May 31 21:57:05 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong. OP already understands that it's an irrational feeling. The mechanism that writing your own apology letter operates on is itself counter-intuitive. It functions on a subconscious level. It needn't make intellectual sense for the other person to apologize. As to what he would say, I can think of a few things.  'I'm sorry that my problems have become a problem for your relationship. Thank you for loving my mother. I'm sorry that I'm awkward and unsightly. I don't know how to get better but I know it's wrong to be this way and I should improve.'  Basically, in the fictional apology, the kid acknowledges that he's a problem for OP and asks forgiveness for it. I won't pretend to understand how it works on a neurological level except that your brain evidently responds as though that person actually said all those things you wanted them to say."

DecidingToBeBetter,37x0bu,llovemybrick_,7,Mon Jun 1 05:57:45 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest putting yourself in his situation,  I mean really sit down and think of what his life must be like.  You have seen some things about him that you don't like,  chances are he knows those things also,  and it's probably eating him up inside .   Its incredibly easy to build negative thoughts about people because we don't understand how life must be for them. Most people would just think 'sucks to be them ' and then move on.  And this attitude can cause a person to feel lonely and isolated.  You'd be surprised how was and often it happens.   Without any support of help to change ourselves we will gladly reside ourselves of our fate.  But you'll never be able to be able to change him and yourself if you don't understand how it feels to be him.  If you can't have even the smallest part of empathy for him then the relationship will never change. You mentioned he is overweight,  and that you guys go on family walks,  I can see how those two things would really help him,  some exercise and encouragement will go along way.  I don't know if your are particularly fit,  but you probably have a general idea of how eat and exercise  properly,  I'll bet he doesn't. Could always start with teaching him that. I'm sure he'd appreciate someone taking an interest in his wellbeing.    As for the communication problem,  there is a good chance that if he is as lonely as I think he is,  that those bursts of intense communication are a result of not many other people talking to him,  perhaps he is excited that someone cares what he thinks and gets caught up in himself.  it could also be an anxiety issue.  You say you guys don't talk alot,  perhaps he feels nervous in your presence and it causes him to jabber on.   Perhaps just start slow and make an effort to acknowledge his presence whenever you see him.  Just a quick 'hey'  or A 'how was your day'. I think the result of this will allow him to build a bit of trust and perhaps relax a bit more around you.   Once you have built up a rapport then you can actually get to know this kid for who he really is,  maybe he will come to you for advice,  or you guys might find a hidden interest that you share.    Trust me on this part though,  this is his home and he can't exactly leave it,  he has been part of that family all his life, you are the new person here.  when you got married and became his step-dad in title you became part of that kids development.  For positive or negative you are a part of his life.  if you continue on the path of pushing him out then you are destroying the very core of his support system.    Without a safe comfortable environment with people who support you, a kid can become lost very quickly.  If you can't trust the people who are supposed to be there to support you no matter what,  then he will probably have a hard time trusting anyone.  Just open yourself up and just talk to the kid.  Stop thinking of him as the useless blob and just think of the potential he has,  and you can bring that out in him.  Imagine that for a minute!  you have a chance to make a genuine difference,  you don't get many of those in a lifetime.  Are you gonna man up and take the challenge or are you going to walk away having never tried?"

I was excluded from family meals, banished to my room constantly, excluded from vacations and the only words she ever said to me were hateful and negative. I knew she hated me since I was 8 years old.  Because of her mental and emotional abuse and an enabling father who chose not to address the abuse (YES, YOU ARE ABUSING your stepson!) I began to self harm and contemplate suicide. The rejection at home led me to make poor choices and have horrible self esteem which lasted until my early 20's.   I can't explain the constant anxiety, torture, self hatred, and pain my mind was in for almost my whole life because of this cruel treatment. I have had to be in therapy for over ten years to combat the constant barrage of PTSD symptoms I have from suffering my childhood.   You would be doing your stepson a favor by divorcing the mother and leaving their lives. How dare you abuse a child? Your actions are permanently damaging and atrocious. You are ruining a child's life. Ruining it.  You want advice so take it. Leave this family and stay away from children forever. You feel guilty for how you treat the child so make it right and just get the hell out. THEN you can focus on becoming less of a blind, hateful person so you never abuse anyone ever again. I can't think of any words that can capture the severity of the damage you are doing to this poor boy. Just leave."

This is going to take some time, so start slowly.  He's aware of how you feel about him and rightly so probably very wary of you.  He sounds like he's at a very gawky age, everyone goes through these!  He also sounds like he needs guidance from you, since he's living with you and your wife. . .it's really hard to parent other people's children, so if his father is in the mix, let him do the fathering.  Imagine he does grow into an adult who does great things, you've had an influence on him!  Imagine if he doesn't - unfortunately, you've also had an influence.

DecidingToBeBetter,37tn2c,Proton_Driver,1 point,Sun May 31 01:42:28 2015 UTC,"Gluconeogenesis:       Gluconeogenesis (GNG) is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids. While primarily odd-chain fatty acids can be converted into glucose, it is possible for at least some even-chain fatty acids.  It is one of the two main mechanisms used by humans and many other animals to maintain blood glucose levels, avoiding low blood glucose level (hypoglycemia). The other means of maintaining blood glucose levels is through the degradation of glycogen (glycogenolysis).   Gluconeogenesis is a ubiquitous process, present in plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms.  In vertebrates, gluconeogenesis takes place mainly in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex of the kidneys. In ruminants, this tends to be a continuous process.  In many other animals, the process occurs during periods of fasting, starvation, low-carbohydrate diets, or intense exercise. The process is highly endergonic until it is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP or GTP, effectively making the process exergonic. For example, the pathway leading from pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate requires 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of GTP to proceed spontaneously. Gluconeogenesis is often associated with ketosis. Gluconeogenesis is also a target of therapy for type 2 diabetes, such as the antidiabetic drug, metformin, which inhibits glucose formation and stimulates glucose uptake by cells.

DecidingToBeBetter,37tn2c,sneeku,12,Sat May 30 09:00:07 2015 UTC,"From experience this is the only thing that really works. Staying up late into the night staring at a bright screen is very unnatural for humans, normally we'd have gone to bed soon after sundown, lacking anything else to do. It is to this more natural state which I believe we should all attempt to return."
DecidingToBeBetter,37tn2c,YJM,0,Sat May 30 11:24:44 2015 UTC,"Soon after sundown is not a very good ""natural living"" plan at least here in Finland.. Today sundown was at 12pm and 2 weeks from now there will be one day without any sundown at all. In winter it could happen as soon as 4pm."

DecidingToBeBetter,37tn2c,threek,7,Sat May 30 21:57:51 2015 UTC,"You might consider getting a sleep study done, to rule out any treatable problems (like sleep apnea, etc) that reduce the quality of your sleep. You can also read up on good/bad sleep habits to make sure you are not sabotaging yourself in some way (Good: go to bed at the same time every day even on weekends. Bad: fall asleep watching TV. etc). Think about your diet - do you drink caffeinated sodas or coffee after 3pm? Do you have large meals after 8PM? Both of these CAN (not will) affect some people negatively for sleep.    Consider using some of the sleep monitoring apps, like SnoreLab or some of the others that try to watch your sleep cycles by detecting your movements overnight. Or, get a night-vision web cam (Like Foscam sells) and record yourself sleeping overnight and see if there are any unexpected patterns (sleepwalking?!).   Read the literature on sleep, to better understand what we now know about it. Our understanding of sleep has tremendously increased, so take advantage of this learning.    Good night, and good luck."
DecidingToBeBetter,37tn2c,twinhed,3,Sun May 31 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"I'm currently developing the habit of doing the same. What's been working for me for the past week is putting my alarm across the room, so I'm forced to get all the way out of bed to turn it off, instead of just rolling over and hitting snooze. I then just WILL myself to wash my face, which wakes me up."
DecidingToBeBetter,37tn2c,intronert,3,Sat May 30 12:10:24 2015 UTC,"But whenever I do that I just get up, turn it off and fall back into bed. I can't put it outside my room."
DecidingToBeBetter,37tn2c,AlcohoIicSemenThrowe,2,Sat May 30 09:32:48 2015 UTC,"You can PRACTICE getting up when your alarm goes off. Pick a day when you do not have to get up. Once you get up and move around for a while, go back and set your alarm for 5-10 mins in the future, and get back in bed. Nice and comfy, right? Now, when the alarm goes off, GET OUT of BED, and stay out for 15-20 mins, doing what ever activity keeps you alert.   Repeat the cycle 3-5 more times in a row that day, and start to get to know that feeling of getting up and out of bed even when you are sleepy.  If you have two days off from school or work, do this both days, at LEAST once a day.  You are REPLACING one habit (alarm goes off -> go back to sleep), with another habit (alarm goes off - GTFU!!!).   Once you start learning how it feels to get up, you can start re-inforcing that habit throughout the week. You do not need (or want) to suddenly force yourself to get up 5 hours earlier than you usually do, but you want to start having some early and easy successes.  Good luck, and good morning!"
DecidingToBeBetter,37tn2c,interactor,2,Sat May 30 15:32:40 2015 UTC,Get a philips wakeup light. I can't wake up from sounds most of the times. It wakes you up with a pretty soothing tone and a light that simulate the sun. Half an hour before time it starts and gets brighter until the alarm rings. Never slept through it.

DecidingToBeBetter,37tn2c,defeldus,1 point,Sat May 30 13:13:19 2015 UTC,"It is usually best to start with regulating your wake times, and you will naturally start getting tired earlier at night. So set alarms and stick to them no matter what; find a way to commit to it. Maybe tell a friend or family member about it, and have them make sure you are up.  It is recommended that you usually stay within an hour of the same wake time every day. You could start by setting an alarm for noon, then 11, etc. Your biggest challenge will be making the decision to get up to your alarm, and actually getting up. It's always easier to stay awake then it is to wake up."

I just scanned a lotion in my bathroom so it forces you to get up but if your case is really bad, scan something on the other side of your house, lol.   When you get the app, it's free at first so you can try it out before you upgrade."
DecidingToBeBetter,37tn2c,landstand3r,1 point,Sat May 30 19:21:02 2015 UTC,"Start waking up at the same time. Work day or weekend, no exceptions. During the first week you'll probably need an alarm clock for that (and you might feel uneasy, as your sleep routine is being changed), but in a few weeks the process of getting up will become a lot easier, and, according to my experience, pleasurable. Getting to bed early enough and leaving the curtains open (so the light contributes to waking up) contributes to it substantially."

And also, definitely get to sleep sooner if you can. Instead of staying up 2 days at a time then crashing, I have been trying to get at least 7 hours of sleep a night (6 makes it difficult for me to wake). So given a time you need to wake up, know when you need to go to bed to get 6-8 hours and make sure you don't stay up later than that."
DecidingToBeBetter,37tn2c,constipationnow,1 point,Sat May 30 21:15:52 2015 UTC,"I struggled with this for about 3 years. The worst thing was that no harm was done, if i slept in and went to work at noon or maybe even later. So there was no pressure to even get up early.  At some point it started messing with my motivation. And i knew i had to get this situation under control.   Here are the things i tried at first:  - Didn't look at computer/phone screens late at night. (later i actually installed flux on my laptop) - tried to take melatonin pills, (they worked more than any sleeping pills i've tried) but i felt clouded in the morning and was affecting my work a little. - exercise. Every time i picked up exercising, it made me feel so much better.  These tips really improved my sleeping experience but i still had trouble going to sleep at a reasonable hour.  So finally i asked some friends to call me 8 am every day (alarms didn't work because i started pressing the snooze button while still being asleep). And for 3 months now my father/friends have called me 8 am every day and the last month i have finally started waking up before the morning call and what's more important - i really feel rested in the morning."

And when you do that you make it a point to get up, standing, and take a step towards the bathroom / kitchen and do your early morning routine!"

I think realizing that is what's put me on this tear to fix this."
DecidingToBeBetter,37ld68,entrepreneurabroad,2,Thu May 28 21:42:38 2015 UTC,"Good on you. Keep us updated with your progress! You might also find writing regularly helps, and will give you a record you can look back on to see how much you've actually achieved :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,37mr16,jjme,2,Thu May 28 19:39:22 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but where do you draw the line?  If you're not happy with your living situation, is it better to move or make peace with it.  If you want a nicer house, or a place to yourself rather than having roommates, do you not work harder to increase your income to achieve this?  I understand balance is key, so I'm asking, I guess, in your experience, where you find the balance is drawn between acceptance and simply a lack of progress towards goals or wants.  Sure the Buddha would say desire is the root of all suffering, and I know happiness is more a decision and mindstate than final destination found through a rat race, but ...  I've been trying to sort a few life options out lately and would simply welcome your two cents on the matter.  Thanks!"
DecidingToBeBetter,37mr16,enlguy,1 point,Fri May 29 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"All valid questions.  I don't think there is anything wrong with making choices.  That is different to me than ""giving up.""  Making choices for a life you desire is great.  It's the inevitable obstacles of life though that we must realize are going to come whether we like it or not.  In that regard - I have found I'm happier if I give up and go with the flow.  I don't struggle too much.    To be clear, I am soon to turn 43.  I have a leadership position and a high paying job.  I have a wife and 2 children.  I am not ""giving up"" and not showing up to work.  I am not giving up and refusing to pay my bills.  That's not what I'm speaking of.  I am making choices to be responsible and do good work and provide for myself and my family.   What I am GIVING UP is the desire to be in control of every little thing.  Many times we make decisions and then things do not go as planned.  This used to make me NUTS.  I am finding peace now that I realize - struggle is a part of the ride.  Make choices, breathe, bad things happen, breathe, good things happen, breathe.  Stop believing my WILL can override the natural ebb and flow of life.  That is all.    I hope that gives you some insight to my little epiphany!"
DecidingToBeBetter,37mr16,enlguy,1 point,Fri May 29 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"Also to add... Balance - to me - is a balance between the inevitable ""light and dark"" of life.  We have this misconception (especially in the West) where we have to achieve HAPPINESS.  That is impossible to achieve some blissful state that you reside in 100% of the time.  Happiness cannot exist without Sadness.  Balance is the acceptance of both.  It's a stepping back and recognizing the roller coaster ride.    You are never going to arrive at a day where you go - Oh!  Now I get it.  Now I'm happy.  And life arrives with a tidy wrapped up package.  Balance is peace.  Peace is an acceptance that whether you are happy or sad - it's temporary and part of the breathing in and out of all creation."
DecidingToBeBetter,37mr16,enlguy,1 point,Fri May 29 17:04:53 2015 UTC,"I love that last line.  I was going to argue Buddha would say in enlightenment, you are always happy, but maybe that's just an interpretation I made, it's that you stop fretting over good and bad.  I don't know.    I guess to follow up... here's the thing, and it doesn't matter that we've never met, I take advice respectfully from anyone I think may have insight I don't possess, or for nothing else, another perspective.  I'm trying to apply this to a very particular situation I'm in right now.  I .. oh, man, this could be a long story.  Let's cut it shorter to the point.  I was living in a house I was not totally happy in.  The vibe was off - the homeowner lived there and was anal to the point of leaving nasty notes taped to the cupboards if a couple things were left in the drying rack.  There were five people renting rooms in this place, so as you can imagine, there was a LOT of passive aggressive behavior on his part that wore thin.  I met a girl online, we hung out, she took me back to her place an hour drive away.  I started realizing how lacking the environment I had been living in was.  The other renters were kind of anti-social, and two of the older gentlemen ran Christian groups - they talked about being non-judgmental, but in practice were quite antagonistic.  The area was loaded with military personnel, and when I met my neighbors, they came to my house with guns.  It was not a pleasant vibe there.  So I was invited to stay here.  And I have been.  We're not exactly romantic anymore, but everyone has decided it's cool.  Thing is (I know this is going on a bit, but I want to provide necessary background), her and her grandma who lives here, are two of the nicest people in the world to me, but are a bit negative themselves.  I mean, major depressive type stuff, and a good day is when I don't get trapped in a conversation about how someone used to be raped or abused, or a complete breakdown is had over the fact that someone didn't put bbq sauce in the takeout order.  These are some of the worst examples, but you can see there is some sulking around at times.  I work from home, and I've noticed my motivation dropping.  I don't pay rent here, and I don't make a lot of money - it's freelancing, so I have no guarantees, even though the past couple months have gone pretty well for income.  I found a cheap sublet, but it DOES mean spending several hundred a month, the new would-be roommate said he smokes pot (they do here, too, but we've had that talk and it's kept outside now), he's admitted to being anti-social himself, and it's in a small town that is several hours away, so I'd be pretty stuck there.  I won't know until I try, says one friend of mine, but it's the financial risk that rubs me, as I just bought some land in Arizona I'm saving money to build on later this year, and so I'm watching the cash flow closely.  Having my own place would be a dream come true.    SO...  I'm faced between the two situations, neither perfect, but I've been asking myself - is moving to the sublet just running away from this place, where I'm cared about to boot, even if they're not perfect.  I've relegated to keeping myself in the room with headphones just to avoid potential negativity as it was getting tough to deal with.  To I gamble on the other place being better?  Only one roommate there who won't be around a ton.  But the money spent.  Is it worth it?    Welcome to my mind's circles.  If you made it through all this, I have nothing but gratitude for you, and would again welcome your thoughts.  Thank you!!!!"
DecidingToBeBetter,37mr16,enlguy,1 point,Fri May 29 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"Wow - that sounds like a lot of stress for you.  Well, please don't think I have the answer for you.  I wouldn't dare presume to have my shit totally figured out.  I am a seeker, like you it seems, and so I like to share my personal epiphanies.    That said - I do believe you've got yourself a pattern here.  Ending up in at least two situations (that I know of) where you are inexpensively under someone else's roof - and feeling the need to burrow within your private space because of the stress of the environment.    I'm a big believer in home being a sanctuary.  You need a place to feel rest - on every level.    Again, when I speak of ""giving up,"" I don't mean to say ""do nothing,"" or ""become a door mat,"" or even keep the hand you're dealt.  I mean to say, learn to flow WITH the stream.  You aren't flowing in a stream right now.  Sounds like you tried to, but you got caught in an eddy behind a big bolder.  You need to make the effort and make the decisions that will get you out of said space.    Get a job that gets more money perhaps.  Or get a 2nd job.  Or find a roommate that isn't a ""friend"" and treat it as a formal arrangement, with house rules.  Have your own SPACE.    If an ""act of God"" occurs and your roof caves in - THAT is what I mean by ""giving up."" In that instant, you would be best served to ""give up"" and not stress.  You should still take the steps to repair the damn roof, of course. Similarly, If your roommate doesn't like you and calls you names every day,  you would ""give up"" by NOT TRYING TO CHANGE HIS/HER MIND.  You would accept that this happened and it sucks, and you would move on to make a decision to remove yourself from the painful situation.  It doesn't mean you sit there b/c you're waiting for something miraculous to come save you.    It's the WILL we are giving up.  It's the EGO.  It's the EMOTIONS.  Thing is... you'll still experience all three of those parts of you.  Will, Ego, Emotions.  But you must learn to simply observe them as parts of you -the same way you would observe your thumb if it got a cut on it.  Then move on.  Meditation helps this.    I wish you luck!!  Let me know what happens.  :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,37mr16,enlguy,1 point,Sat May 30 01:22:10 2015 UTC,"I've heard a lot if this before, in relation to letting go of ego.  I used to think I had it mastered, but somewhere along the line...  I've greatly improved my financial health after years of seeking as a wanderer.  Home is what I seek now, more fervently than ever, I think.    Just to pick A LITTLE, if the roof caved, yeah I'd move on, but can't say I'd be happy about it.  Is being emotionless really the goal?  I actually did just land a lot more work at the resorts (Colorado) for the summer, so I'm scrambling to find a sublet up there now.  Hopefully, it will go a little better."
DecidingToBeBetter,37mr16,enlguy,1 point,Sat May 30 04:32:54 2015 UTC,"I think you're still confusing Peace with Happiness.  They are not the same.  Of course you would be pissed as hell if the roof caved in.  Or scared, or whatever human emotion came up.  That's to be expected.  Peace is allowing that negative emotion to happen just as equally as allowing the positive emotion of ""happy"" to happen.  The point is - both sides of the coin have to exist for our reality to exist.  Peace is not judging ourselves when it's negative and not expecting to somehow ""land"" in a permanent state of happiness.    Being emotionless is far from the goal.  It's to be full of emotion - and to not get caught in those emotions as being the absolute truth of each moment.  It's taking a step back and observing.  It's understanding that life is filled with both good and bad things that happen and good and bad reactions to things that happen.  When we allow our emotions to have such overwhelming control over our psyche, we get confused about what is real.  When we make decisions for our life while being engulfed in a particular emotion (happy or sad) it is usually not a great decision in the end."
DecidingToBeBetter,37mr16,nomalaise,1 point,Sat May 30 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"Adding one thought, I decided many years ago I would never again work a job that drained me just to afford a place.  If I'm miserable the bulk of my waking hours, what's the point?  You make the best, but months on end of shitty work doesn't make a good life.  My credit needs to be rebuilt anyway before I can think of buying a house, but it's hard to carve out a space alone when I can't stand corporate office work.  I got seller financing on some land and want to build a tiny house on the cheap.  That's my goal for a space to myself.  Hoping to save a bunch of money this summer."

For whatever reason a lot has ""clicked"" into place for me lately.  I credit some of my own journey coming to a head and being forced to meditate and take a good long look at myself.  See, I'm a newly recovered alcoholic.  I never was the type that got arrested or would anyone have really known that I was a problem drinker.  I would isolate myself and drink alone in order to mitigate the stress of my problems and responsibility in life.  Since getting sober about 3 and a half months ago, I've had a lot of ""aha's.""  I am far from being done learning about myself though.  Honestly - they say that 1st year of sobriety is a doozie as you continue to have revelations about life and your place in it.  So - I'm just a newbie.  Take what I say with a grain of salt - but know that I give it lovingly.  I wish you well."

The trick is to keep the largely populated subreddits to a minimum as with greater mass the product goes down. I mean look at youtube comments.  Honorable mentions goes to /r/youtubehaiku though the comments can be pretty stupid sometimes, there's funny videos.

I am aware that the anonymity factor tends to have people think that they can ""get away"" with being obnoxious to others.    I have also observed that some of the subreddits that I find informative, and while they are not negative in and of themselves, they do tend to have a handful of individuals who have to have death matches in always being right or having the last word on whatever topic, well after others would have stopped discussing it.  Rather than advising such antagonistic ones to get a life (which tends to be at the root of their problem posting), I do that myself.    I just avoid addressing such ones or responding to any posts they make in the thread or to to me directly, as I find it is a complete waste of my time, intellect, and emotional investment in the topic.  I would much rather go to a subreddit where I could be of some minor help than to invest myself in antagonistic conversations."

The most angry and negative sites I've ever seen are the sports forums where my husband posts, IDK why those people get so mad about who threw the ball in the goal more times.   People on reddit often seem hyper-defensive and like they're looking for a fight all the time. I think most of us would be happier and waste less time on internet fights if we took a breath and considered things before replying."
DecidingToBeBetter,37dm38,NormanBalrog,12,Tue May 26 21:25:56 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.

And similar to what blinkingsandbeepings said, I think Reddit is a kind of model of the internet as a whole. People love drama (which is why ""reality TV"" is so popular), and on the internet - i.e. Reddit - creating drama with/for faceless strangers is a very easy way to satisfy that very shallow, superficial craving for dramatic reactions."
DecidingToBeBetter,37dm38,AnxiousCynic,16,Tue May 26 21:46:17 2015 UTC,"I remember one of my first posts on reddit was stating that New Mexico's roads were rated one of the top 10 in the nation one year (No. 2, I think).  It was a response in thread about which state had the worst roads.  Guy responded with, ""No, they're not.""  I provide a link to the actual Govt. study.  Guy responded with an anecdotal, ""I rode on them.  My back hurt.""  Not sure if it counts as a negative or cynical, but it definitely seemed argumentative for the sake of being contrarian."

It can be hard to determine the exact origin of such behavior, but I'd think in that instance the guy was just using combative language as a means of sharing his anecdotal evidence. That's obvious, of course, but what I mean to say is people oftentimes tend to lean towards being negative far more than being positive; so, you have someone who wants to disagree based on personal experience (which happens to be negative) and the easiest way to do that, while protecting the ego and putting forth a ""I don't care what you think, if you disagree"", is to state it plainly and act as though anecdotal evidence overrides a consensus. All of that to say, save for pre-existing cynicism, the guy simply disagreed because of his own experience, but couldn't be bothered with being a real person long enough to comment in a way that didn't immediately dismiss you/your view. And all of that is to reinforce the point of this thread, in that people on the internet (Reddit) are often needlessly negative, harsh, and/or just plain mean in the way they interact with others... I have no idea what I just said. :p"

Where we are all anonymous the issue is not just that our mean comments are unattached to a real identity (for some, the Username is a very real identity). It's more that everybody suddenly becomes equal with intellectual authority and research not mattering as much as they would when you post your opinion in the 'real world.' And it's easy and inconsequential to express your approval. Comments get upvoted impulsively by people who agree based on their personal ideologies. And in an online argument, there is no time to actually research and question your own standpoint - or, goodness forbid, admit that you're wrong. When you're on the internet you are defined by your opinions, so to maintain your identity, you adopt a mindset of forced stasis rather than growth. People get the impression that their opinions are more important than they really are, and care more about stating their opinions over and over than actually questioning or changing them."

The more I heard, the more it just sounded like a site full of bullies and asses. I'm not sure what made me join, but I am glad I did because I ended up meeting a very great friend on here (despite whatever issues we may or may not be going through right now here lately). But otherwise, I still would tend to agree with you, though I do also meet a lot of cool people too on here."

Aside from subbing to the wonderful subs that others have posted, I'd also recommend paying the dollar to buy reddit gold. It allows you to filter out /r/all so you never have to see the fatpeoplehate sub again (or others like it). It also lets you into something of a secret world of reddit that I think you would find very appealing."

It's easy to talk shit and put people down if you'll never be held personally accountable for your words, and you're shielded from witnessing any emotional effects they might have.  I think you're primarily referring to hostility from users, but I wanted to pass on that I got a lot of mileage out of unsubscribing from /r/worldnews and a few others. I realized that the information presented was significantly skewed towards pessimism and it was just making me pissed off and depressed all the time. I added /r/betternews instead, and I can get the headlines without the massive spin.  Choosing the sources of information that you expose yourself to is very important for mental health and your overall worldview."

DecidingToBeBetter,37ffkk,jayspaceman,4,Wed May 27 06:02:11 2015 UTC,"I'm struggling with this, too. There's that part of me that feels like I could just ascribe to a compromised set of goals and standards, but that I would be lying to myself. I've been trying to focus on the smaller things before I aim higher. For instance, you need to have a decent source of income before you can advance to, say, intellectual and athletic development. I also feel like you can rapidly shift between these needs as they come, so don't feel like you're selling short on your large ambitions, just because you need to prioritize. Just get things in order.   For example, I have all these dreams about the awesome friends I'm going to have and all the adventures I'll go on, but it seems so distant because I've barely taken the first step in overcoming my social anxiety/inability to make new friendships. Obviously I need to go make some (any) friends before I can optimize my social life."
DecidingToBeBetter,37ffkk,rainboseaweed,2,Wed May 27 07:06:15 2015 UTC,It does make sense that I need to prioritize and work on the smaller things before I can work on the larger things. Maybe that's a better way too look at it. Maybe I'm just overwhelming myself.
DecidingToBeBetter,37ffkk,rainboseaweed,2,Wed May 27 14:27:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've found it to be a necessary balance. Of course keep your larger ideals and goals in mind, but also realize that you are where you're at and that there's a practical course of action involved with pursuing those ideals (which, try as you might, you will never FULLY attain). It's all about progress.   Big picture is essential, but so is practical, realistic action, with strategic regard for limitations. You gotta be starry-eyed but also pragmatic and a little humble."
DecidingToBeBetter,37ffkk,BreakMyLimits,1 point,Thu May 28 01:27:39 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying. That's probably a smart way to go about it. I'll just have to find a way to train myself to start thinking that way. It's not just one or the other, but a good mix.  I guess I have this fucked up image of what it means to be accomplished (at least with what it seems everybody is saying), so it'll be a bit hard to settle for less than that. But I will do it."
DecidingToBeBetter,37ffkk,rainboseaweed,1 point,Thu May 28 02:14:19 2015 UTC,"You have some good points here...  But I want to call you out on that ""having enough income""  thing for intellectual/athletic development.   If your idea of both of those us something like ""go to Harvard""  and have a world-class training program with a staff of personal trainers,  then yes.   But there are numerous free or nearly free ways for both of those things.   If I'm misunderstanding I apologize,  but if your vision is based on the limiting belief of ""I don't have enough money/resources,""  You're shooting yourself in the foot by cutting off numerous possibilities."
DecidingToBeBetter,37ffkk,BreakMyLimits,2,Wed May 27 13:47:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't get me wrong, it's easier than ever to improve in these areas if you're willing to seek out available resources (even free ones) and improvise. For example, if you're unemployed and have little going on socially, even with no internet (god forbid), you can still go to the library and read/research in books or on public computers. You can still probably get a cheap gym membership, maybe play pick up sports.   And you beat level 0 of the ""broke in every way to self actualization"" game and you use your own computer with free wifi at starbucks. You can now learn computer based skills like programming (if you're remotely interested in it) or play games (which are actually great).   Not to mention that your development in lower levels of the ladder can contribute to the higher ones, if you are creative with your attitude and perspectives.   My biggest realization is that it's all about how you view things and how much control and experimentation you are willing to put into your mindset, which if done properly can allow for awesome growth even if you can't pay some bills.   Yeah, saying ""I can't write my long-awaited book yet because I'm only making $20K a year"" is dumb. Don't do dat. At the same time, it miiight be a good idea to get some money in the bank before starting that new artistic/athletic course you have in mind."
DecidingToBeBetter,37ffkk,BreakMyLimits,2,Thu May 28 01:24:13 2015 UTC,"I am pretty ambitious and want to achieve great things for myself. However, I'm also a fairly logical and down to earth sort of person.    These aren't mutually exclusive.  It looks to me like you either have a values conflict happening - tough to explain here,  but basically that ambition conflicting with down-to-earth,  or what underlies that.   Moving forward,  is there a way that you be both ambitious and be down-to-earth?   Also,  you're almost taking a stance that you can't succeed, so why bother trying?   Do you actually have hard evidence you're going to fail,  or is it just in your head?   Also,  consider this: every wildly successful person has failed. A lot.   We don't see that.  We just see the end result of their achievement.   If you're not failing,  you're not learning. Massive success is built on a foundation of failure.   Take Richard Branson.  Billionaire.  Has had over 300 businesses fail. Damn.   Failure is always a possibility.  But lacking certainty triggers our survival mechanisms in our brain creating stress. Peter Sage says that one of the biggest keys to success is simply learning to manage uncertainty.   So I'm going to ask you a question.  If the answer is yes,  go for it.  If it's no,  find something to do that would make it a yes.   If money was no issue and your success was guaranteed,  is this something you would still go for?"
DecidingToBeBetter,37ffkk,BreakMyLimits,2,Wed May 27 13:40:40 2015 UTC,"I think that's part of the problem. Probably my most ambitious goal is to be wealthy and successful. So, if money was no issue and my success guaranteed, then I would have already achieved that.  I think growing up I've always been told or had the mindset that great things always happen to ""somebody else"" or ""there's always somebody better than you"" meaning statistically I won't be able to be great. I really want to be great, but logically I know it's extremely unlikely, even impossible.  But you are right, success is built on failure, so I suppose even if I inevitably don't get what I want, I should at least try."
DecidingToBeBetter,37ffkk,eatafatdickyoufuck,2,Wed May 27 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"You bring up some good points,  especially if you have those beliefs that it can only happen to someone else.   Here's a couple questions for you:  What to you is ""success?""  What to you is ""greatness?""   Maybe write it down on a piece of paper and see what comes out.   I'm not sure where you are,  but here we have a cultural definition of success that involves being rich and powerful.   But the thing is,  neither of those bring happiness.  Even people who win the lottery are only happy from it for about six months.   We tend to look at success and happiness as goals.  The problem is you can't aim.  They're concepts that come and go.   What they are are byproducts or side effects of what we do -  of what fulfills us or feels purposeful.   For me money - while nice - is not part of my personal success.  For me,  I feel successful when I work to help others improve their lives.   Money,  too,  is a byproduct. If that's the end goal,  when people have it they either then have to have more or they start feeling lost.   Again,  nothing wrong with money.  I think the best thing is finding what fulfills you most,  and then working to monetize it so you can do more of it :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,37ffkk,eatafatdickyoufuck,2,Wed May 27 15:08:31 2015 UTC,"I think to me, success and greatness is being rich and powerful. I've never had much money, and I've never felt in control of my life. I think that's why I've bought into that cultural definition. I've never been very happy either, and I think I attribute that to the absence of wealth and power.   Now that I think about it, the past five or more years of my life I've been focusing on what I can do to become wealthy and powerful. As if that's the one thing my life is missing. To be honest, I don't know what else I would aspire to. I've spent all this time focusing on what I knew I didn't have."
DecidingToBeBetter,37ffkk,shkibb,2,Wed May 27 15:57:10 2015 UTC,"I was once in a pretty similar place.  I grew up poor with a single mom who struggled to meet the bills - and sometimes didn't,  I felt I had no control,  and I went through a bad depression and almost killed myself.   You have an opportunity here - to figure this shit out sooner,  rather than achieving all that and realizing it after and wondering what it was all for.   This might take some exploration on your part,  but let's put a spin on the earlier question -   If you had all the time in the world,  what would you be doing?   If you don't know,  that's ok.  Think on it.   To help you,  look at some of the rich and powerful people you admire.  Besides their money,  what aspects of them do you admire?   Instead of what they have,  what at they doing? What aspects of what they're doing do you like?   Often what we admire in others is something that's actually within us - it resonates with that part of us.   (for example -  if we admire a singer it doesn't necessarily mean we want to sing - we could admire that they bring joy to others,  or perform,  etc.)"

Anyways, getting to how this relates to the article. In a way, I'm grateful for my depression now because it helps keep me grounded and realistic. I needed to become narcissistic and egocentric to combat my depression, but its also my depression that keeps me from becoming unrealistic with myself in the way the article mentions.  I know who I am, my problems and shortcomings, and my horrible flaws; at the same time I know the person who I want to be, the person who I want to become through hard work, dedication, and perseverance."

DecidingToBeBetter,37d252,beelee123,4,Tue May 26 20:39:00 2015 UTC,"Hi, bernkastel6. Being sensitive to those around you is actually a wonderful asset to any human being. If you are smart about it, this can help you get a good job, work things out with the important people in your life, draw others to you, and on and on. I know how you feel, because I've been that person. Overly concerned about what others thought, letting unworthy people define what kind of a person I was (or how my day was going to go) and maintaining unhealthy relationships. There are so many lessons I have learned and they have made a transformational difference in my life. Let me see if I can put some of this into words and action steps for you. I think the first and most important step is to decide that you are important and of value. You have to make a choice. Either you let your teachers, classmates, or anyone else around define who you are, or You decide who you are. We all have choices, whether conscious or not, and we all have to live with our choices. The great thing is that if we learn how to make better choices, the results we have to live with are better! I have decided that I want to be a good person, I want to live a good life, I want to be a great mother, a great wife, a great sister and daughter and teacher. I don't always live up to my own expectations, but it's gotten me a lot farther than wanting someone else to think that I'm a great anything. Another lesson I have learned, which is a difficult concept and one you may need to review a few times to internalize it, is that ""what someone else has to say about you behind your back is none of your business."" This lesson has relieved me from worrying about what anyone else has to say or think about me. I intentionally am Considerate of the people in my life and in my surroundings, but if someone has a problem with something I've said or done they have an obligation to say something to me, and I can think about what they said and decide if it's something I need to change or not. Don't be defensive, just listen and do a little self evaluation and decide if it's a legitimate problem or not. You have to remember that some people thrive off of being negative, it's the only way they know how to make themselves feel better about their own lives.  ""I know you can do better"" is such a teacher phrase! I'm a high school teacher, but I also use it as a mother. This is just telling you that I believe if you put a little more effort into this assignment, that I think you could do a lot better. Essentially, your teacher is asking you to put more effort into your assignment. Also, as a teacher, I am a perpetual student and I have a firm belief that there is always more to learn and that no matter how great a job I've done, there are still things that I can change for next time to make it better. And finally, but maybe most importantly, your self image is unhealthy. How about, ""I often picture myself as a smart, curvy, caring woman who is a beautiful, educated, purposeful, attentive person and I'm looking to become a stronger person so that I can make an even bigger difference in the world!"" I'm sure you've heard that saying, ""God, give me the strength to change the things I can and the serenity to accept the things I can't."" Life can be a big pain in the rear, but if you focus on all the negatives, that's all your going to get out of it. I make a practice every morning to thank my God for all the good things I have in my life. Sometimes my list is short, sometimes it's long, but either way, it helps me to be positive and keep working towards something better. It's all about who you choose to be, and learning to love yourself enough to make the changes that you want to make. Action step 1: Decide if you are going to allow others to define who you are or if You are going to define who you are. Action step 2: Decide what kind of a person you want to be. (hint: set high expectations) Action step 3: Take a worrying load off, decide to be Considerate of Others, and let the Others bring up any points that you might need to worry about. (hint: some concerns are legitimate, others are not and you have to decide which ones need to be addressed) Action step 4: Make a list of all the good things in your life and all the good things about you. If you need, talk to friends or your parents to get some input. You need to write this down and go through the mental exercise of adding to this list on a daily basis.  Good luck girlie :-) Becoming a stronger person is something that everyone is capable of doing, but only the ones trying will get there... you're on the right track!!!"

DecidingToBeBetter,37gtc5,Lightfiend,6,Wed May 27 15:03:54 2015 UTC,"I only read a bit more than half of that book many years ago- so I can't comment on the accuracy of the parallels the author of this article is making. However, I do agree with the conclusions he has reached, regardless of their association with the book.  It's not all as easy as he makes it out to be, however. Simply deciding not to play by the rules has consequences. It can lead to loss of livelihood, loss of relationships, and loss of security. Without some kind of support system, one can become victimized over and over.   Refusing to play by the rules can also lead to many unforseen consequences, which range from mild to catastrophic. This human element keeps people tethered to the systems set in place by the powerful, with self-perpetuating reinforcements.  H.P. Lovecraft said, The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear, is fear of the unknown.  It's also not easy to see how one contributes to being complicit in one's own victimization. Whether it is in the home, or the workplace, or society at large, it's difficult to know the things one doesn't know. This is why education is so important, not just to teach us facts and figures and how to live within a system, but to teach us how to explore the edges of our current understanding and how to question the systems which surround us.  The more people are able to support each other in this type of thinking, the less fear there will be about choices to go outside one's current paradigm. Of course, the trick is to take the middle road, and not succumb to the radical opposite of victimization, which is extreme selfishness. Unfortunately, that is the lesson many Rand followers have taken from her works. This leads to contempt for anyone who needs support in self-actualization, and just creates more division.  A better way, is that once one finds success in getting out, they reach their hand back to help the person who is still behind them."

This means I'm usually at work by 1100, so I try to wake up by 0800 to get a good breakfast and workout in. Then I go home and do whatever chores or errands I need to do, and if I have free time I like to play guitar, read, hang out with my family, or go for one of my pet time-wasters.  Mondays, Fridays, and Tuesdays/Wednesdays I work in a hospital. My shifts vary between days and nights. Mondays and Fridays are usually morning shifts, 0700-1700/1900. In that case I wake up at 0430 and get in a good workout and breakfast. After work I'm usually beat and go straight for the time-wasters. Night shifts start at 1700, so those days I'll wake up around 1000 and run errands or do chores until I have to work.  In an average week I'll have one day off, either a Tuesday or a Wednesday. I use that day to do errands I haven't had time to do during the rest of the week, and to relax. My workouts are usually weightlifting early in the morning or running in the evening. I'm looking into starting meal prepping on Sunday evenings but I don't have the supplies just yet.   I can't emphasize sleep hygiene and premeditated time management enough. For my hospital job I pick my own schedule, and my availability at the restaurant is confined to those lunch shifts; the odd dinner shift for extra cash is purely voluntary. Since I work so much and largely pick my own shifts, I try very hard to account for sleep. I really think it's important to get at least 7 hours, even if it requires going to bed at 2100.  I put my shifts in Google Calendar, then I try to plan my sleep, errands, and mandatory fun time around that. I also use the 2Do app on my iPhone to keep track of projects and daily rituals, and the Notes app to track random thoughts - this is analogous to a bastardized version of the GTD method. It's pretty difficult to stay consistently engaged day-to-day, week-to-week with a schedule as varied as mine, but I try my best.  Lmk if you want to know anything else! Also, props for waking up at 0300. That takes some serious conscientiousness."
DecidingToBeBetter,37e6go,Tenens,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:37:44 2015 UTC,By what method did you get to such an early awakening?
DecidingToBeBetter,37e6go,ThatFanficGuy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:27:57 2015 UTC,"I wish I had a good answer for you, but I can't recall how I implemented the change exactly. What I can tell you is that it happened as a part of a serious paradigm shift. Wholesale ""I have got to get my shit together"" stuff. That made it pretty easy to stick to. Other than that, it's basically all time management.   You know when you have to wake up tomorrow and you know how much sleep you need, so you know when you need to go to bed tonight. Then you know how long you have to accomplish everything you're going to do today. Then you know what you're going to have to move to tomorrow and how you're going to have to prioritize things.  Figuring all this out took some studying up on my part. I read books like The Now Habit and some others I can't remember, and generally became extremely dedicated to time management as a necessary step to accomplishing my goals. I followed subreddits like this one and became really laser-focused on becoming the person I wanted to be. I took on new role models like Benjamin Franklin and I saw my values shift from whatever-sounds-good to whatever-I-know-is-right. I had every day planned down to the half-hour, including transportation, food prep, studying, sleep, recreation, and everything else.   Google Calendar worked well for this. I made one calendar where I planned my day out and another where I recorded how I actually spent my time. This gave me valuable data on how long things like driving to school, cooking dinner, and studying actually took as opposed to how long I thought they'd take. It also helped keep me accountable and reasonable in my planning - you don't like seeing plans go essentially abandoned.  Another important thing I did was take time each morning and night to plan the day and review yesterday, and reflect on my week to come.  Honestly, my life right now is a lot less regularly structured than I'd like, but I do my best to make do."
DecidingToBeBetter,37e6go,Tenens,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:48:30 2015 UTC,Any advice you can give to someone who prefers more fluid arrangment of the day?
DecidingToBeBetter,37e6go,ThatFanficGuy,2,Wed Jun 3 00:28:33 2015 UTC,"I suppose that really depends on what your goals are. Is it to be more organized? To be a more effective person? Just to wake up early for it's own sake?   Since you specifically asked about waking up early in your previous post, I'd say, at minimum, to commit to keeping your bedtime and mornings holy. To commit to waking up at a specific time, you have to commit to sleeping at a specific time.   I like to wind down an hour before bedtime, so anything I need to do that day has to be done before that mark. I use that hour to turn off my electronics, shower, wash my face, brush my teeth, plan the next day, and read before bed. I keep ambient light to a minimum during this hour – I like to use candles at this time.  In the morning, it helps to have a few tasks planned for right when you wake up, so that you don't feel like you're waking up early for no reason.  Outside of the morning and evening bookends, your time is yours to manage as you please. I like to make a to-do list every day; usually I do this before I actually schedule specific tasks. I will say that making sure you incorporate intense physical exercise into your routine each day is very helpful for getting that ""fall into bed and die"" sleep."
DecidingToBeBetter,37e6go,Tenens,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:06:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Waking up early brings a special sort of feeling: when there's so much time in the day that you can chase everything down and make it happen. So, on the second thought, maybe I am looking to be more achieving. Besides: at 4:30 AM, even if you're outside, it is as if you're alone in the whole city, alone with your thoughts - the feeling certainly adds to the getting-better mindset, makes me want to do stuff - perhaps because I appreciate life more in those moments.  Perhaps I should take on similar planning habits. What are you reviewing in the evening, and how does that help you do better?"
DecidingToBeBetter,37e6go,ThatFanficGuy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:54:55 2015 UTC,"Throughout the day I record any though I can't immediately deal with. Literally any kind of thought I can't act on gets put in. ""I wonder what that word really means."" ""I need to get dishwasher soap!"" ""Did I send that check?"" ""Maybe it would be good if I started eating more eggs."" ""If I don't do laundry tonight I won't have any scrubs for tomorrow.""  To keep track of this all, I use the Notes app in my iCloud. The main notes are ""Today"", ""Important"", and ""Input"", and miscellaneous ones like ""Buy these"" or ""Look this up"". If one of the thoughts isn't relevant to something I plan on doing today, or something important, it goes into input. Those ones will be categorized at night when I review it all.  Each night and morning I review these notes and assess them. For ""Today"", I make sure I took care of everything I needed to do.   The last thing I do is make tomorrow's ""Today"" and sort it ordinally by time, so I know what I need to do and in what order. I'll use this note all day to make sure I know what the next thing on the agenda is.  My mind races and I have a lot of thoughts, so this helps me make sure I hold onto them. I also review my Google Calendar and make sure I'm doing well on whatever projects I have going on and I'm not forgetting any important appointments. If I'm attempting to implement a new habit that I might have a hard time remembering to do (this is usually the case), I make sure to put it in ""today"" so I don't lose track of it.  An example, for a workday:   Today:  Wake up  Breakfast  Vitamins  Gym  Home  Shower, face, teeth   Dress  Work  Grocery store  Finances  Call mom  Look up obscure lab tests  Dinner  Guitar  Meditate  Cool down   Here, if something comes up and I can't go to the grocery store after work, during my nightly review I would make sure I roll it over into the next day's note.   This all helps me stay organized and stay on top of what I need to be doing."

DecidingToBeBetter,37e6go,Bdi89,1 point,Thu May 28 22:51:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think this is not exactly the right way. By quitting video games and tv (cinema etc.), you are loosing lot of amazing experiences and art. There is generally this opinion, that movies and tv shows are waste of time, yet, nobody here is talking about quitting books or reducing time spent in art gallery. Why? I think, that the reason is, that tv and video games are more accessible, and that people spend shit tons of hours on this. You will not be better person by quitting something you like. You will be better person, if you manage to take control and split your time in more diverse way. I play like 3 hours per week, but hell, I enjoy that time. If the game has a good plot, It is wonderful experience."
DecidingToBeBetter,379399,lighteninglife,14,Mon May 25 21:43:33 2015 UTC,"You know, a lot of people say they don't worry because they believe ""everything happens for a reason"", and I just feel like that's a really unhealthy outlook to have. Sometimes bad things just happen, and theres no rhyme or reason for it. I've seen friends literaly make themselves sick over worrying about why something happened, and the great plan attached to it. It's almost like they are giving life a pass to walk over them, because of...destiny? I don't know. But I think, in an effort to aleviate some worries, sometimes it's healthier to accept that there wasn't some grand design at play - life is ocassionally terrible for absolutely zero reason, and it's alright to admit that it was wrong and should have never happened to you, that it wasn't your fault, and you're not going through it for some ""reason"".   This has mostly to do with people who are worrying themselves over trauma and tramatic events that have happened/are happening in their lives. It's something that took me a long, long time to learn, and many years of therapy. Sorry to get on my soapbox for a moment."

DecidingToBeBetter,379399,DrIGGI,1 point,Tue May 26 17:39:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I use the ""everything happens for a reason"" paradigm too, but for me the only reason is to grow. If something bad happens in your life, you have the opportunity to grow by dealing with the situation. Being able to deal with all the shit that happens to you is like a skill that you can gradually train to perfect it. Being able to take hits means being able to dismiss negative thoughts and emotions from your life thus making more room for positive ones. You can only do that by taking responsibility for yourself.  Kind of reminds me of this inspirational speech from rocky balboa."
DecidingToBeBetter,379399,BigAngryDinosaur,10,Wed May 27 11:21:55 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that if you have anxiety disorder, all the questioning and rationalization in the world won't stop a downward spiral of worry, panic and despair.  Anxiety disorder requires a different set of tools that fight your causes of stress at the source, by actually dealing with your life in a structured, disciplined way to prevent causes of worry from piling up and becoming more than you can handle all at once.  At least this has been my experience. Your results may vary.  Edit: Because I'm getting some questions, I want to add a summary of what worked for me. I posted this in a thread about dealing with alcoholism, which is a common side effect of anxiety and depression:   Try to locate where your life started to change, and go back a few more steps to when you were feeling happy, even if it's early childhood if at all, and if you can trace events or environments that started making you feel anxious, unhappy or stressed then that's a huge step to unraveling the underlying cause. Knowing where you got damaged and admitting that you are damaged is the best way to start fixing the damage.  Once that's worked out (In my case I grew up in a strange, unstable household, surrounded by a lot of drug and alcohol use.) then you can start to work on your current situation.  The best thing for me has been lists.  List what you're unhappy about in your life. List what's stressing you. List what you wish you had. List your dreams and wishes you have/had for your future. This should be your Master List. You start working out ways to tackle each of these issues, but in tiny, bite-sized pieces. The big motivation-killer is when you feel overwhelmed by a mountain of work you need to do to fix a problem you're in, so you either don't even bother trying and escape deeper into medication and substance/self abuse/ escapism, or you try too hard all at once to fix everything, which goes great for a short period of time and then you crash and burn out really hard. This cycle can make you feel like you're manic or even bi-polar so don't rush to self diagnosis. Bi-polarism is a manageable disorder with very specific medication and therapy. Manic behavior from anxiety can be treated just by changing your environment and lifestyle, although I would always suggest anyone seek some professional treatment for a condition that is interfering with daily life.  But back to the plan: If work or study is stressing you, you list what needs to be done in one day to make some progress towards your goal. Not a 12-hour marathon of work/study/exercise either, but something manageable that takes a small piece out of your mountain. There's a reason we work 5 - 8 hours a day normally. Anything past that and we begin to wear down.  You don't want to wear down, don't let yourself get to the point of exhaustion, that's when your willpower breaks down and the ""addict brain"" will take over and give you a lot of really bad ideas which you think are your own, awesome ideas about how to get some well-earned rewards and pleasure.  If you're behind on study or work you have to do, you schedule yourself a couple hours to work on your goal just a little, even if it's just the steps you need to take to get to work on time. Then take a break for no more than a half hour and either get back to your project, or start work on a different project.  Then, when a day is done, and you're tired, but still alert and energized from staying busy, that's when you attend to yourself. Clean your environment. Wash your clothes, do your dishes, or at least one ""chore"" to improve your space.  Don't clean the whole damn house. Just one thing.  Then make your plan for the next day. Repeat this day after day and every time you start to stray and feel overwhelmed, or feel the need to ""reward yourself"" or escape or panic, you go back to your list. DON'T FUCKING STRAY FROM THE GODDAMN LIST.  There's a reason they say ""one day at a time."" It's because people like us, who abuse substances or escapism cannot handle more in our heads than a certain amount of emotion or stress. Any more and we break down and stop caring. You have to focus on little things here and now.  Pick up that thing that's been laying over there for a month. Put it back where it needs to be.  Spend a half hour stretching and then do 5 sit-ups.  Have lunch, time yourself 30 minutes to browse frikking reddit while you eat. NOT A MINUTE MORE.  Now spend two hours working on something from your master list. Then another break.  Wrap up your day at a decent time that you can eat a HEALTHY meal that you prepare yourself. While you eat and check your social media (for the first time today, right? RIGHT??) then you work on the next day's plan. You should use a notebook and really write this down. The act of writing down your plan tells those inner voices inside you that you have a plan and you can fall back on this plan when you feel like you can't do it. If you're not religious, this plan is your higher power. This plan is your rock.  After a week or two, you WILL start to feel results in the form of less anxiety, a more positive outlook and some pride in yourself for actually accomplishing something, even a small part of your goal. Repeat ad infinitum. Take days off. Change your workspace/environment. Keep your environment clean. Eat healthy. GET PLENTY OF SLEEP. Holy shit sleep is important. If you can't sleep, see a doctor, because nothing will help you if you're not sleeping.  After years or trying different things, this has been the only plan that's really helped me stay positive and low on anxiety for more than a day at a time. You have to give yourself time for change to overwrite all those old pathways in your brain which will make you habitually seek out those harmful things that you think makes you happy; Your favorite chair, your bed, your comfort snacks, your computer, your booze, your bong, your phone, your video games, your unhealthy relationships, your bar, your TV shows... etc.  Bring back discipline into your life and other things will fall into place much easier. Also, get help. Either a partner, or a professional therapist or a trusted buddy system to support each other.  Not everything works for all people, this is just what's worked for me. I am not a doctor. Get off reddit. Seriously, reddit is bad for people like us."

I used to be addicted to energy drinks, and cut them off overnight. Worked out even harder. Then I quit smoking. Went from 2 cartons a month and decreased it slowly to about 1 pack a week and then quit. I used to be kinda addicted to video games and then slowly stopped. I still play, but now its maybe 1h a day instead of 6-7hrs. I had lost sight of my goals and values, and I got lucky that someone made me realize how bad I was getting. It was rough realizing it, but it motivated me back into the right direction. We all err along the way, some more than others, but to be better you need to want it.   A year ago I was slowly sinking in misery, with literally no motivation in myself to pull me out. A couple things then happened, and something clicked in my brain. One thing followed another, and ever since I have been happier than I have been in years. Now I get up at 0500 everday to go to the gym, whilst a year ago I would of been on my computer still playing video games. When I look in the mirror these days I suprise myself everytime. I got ripped, got really healthy, and am now performing really well at work (and life in general) I have come far, in a what seems to be a really short time and I hope that others can as well. You just can't give up. Shit happens, but once you learn to deal with it properly, everything is a lot easier. It's really gratifying to hear people who didn't really like you previously say that you're a great guy and that you've changed immensely for the best.

I knew that I didn't want to come back and just resume life where I left it off. I made myself new friends, got interested in new things, and instead  of always avoiding criticism and refuting it, I learnt to accept it and use it as a focal point. I focused my energy on reshaping who I was into something I could be proud of, instead of just merely being unimpressed with myself. I stopped caring about what others thought and made my choices for myself. I set acheivable goals for myself over short periods of time, which when added together, made the end goal a lot easier to attain. Over it all I had a friend who kept me motivated. I really look up to him, and having someone who pushes you at all times wether you are tired, sick, cranky or just overall tired with life in general is really crucial. Without him there I fear I may not have gotten as far, in such a short time. Without him, and my ex, I fear I would have continued on a downward spiral till I snapped and decided to just end it."

DecidingToBeBetter,378ac7,Rydiohead,5,Tue May 26 02:37:22 2015 UTC,"Introspection works best for me. I was unhappy, so I sat down and wrote out my values. From there, I identified what would fulfill me in each area. To get to that place by the time I'm 30, I set some goals. It hasn't been a perfect path, but I've made positive changes because of that exercise."
DecidingToBeBetter,375e7c,bernkastel6,5,Mon May 25 00:57:42 2015 UTC,"Seeking study habit tips is an indication that you are really improving. So, first off, great job!  For me, the best lesson was to do little bits over time. You will be more productive in learning, writing, etc if you can put in 1 or 2 hours outside of class every day. That includes the afternoon/evening after the last class of the week. Take a breath, a nap, or a meal. But no matter what get some work done each day. Rewrite your notes. Or dig into a concept that you didn't really get.  You won't have to pull all nighters if you can chip away at the work slowly. Also, the longer period over which you learn, the longer and fuller it will be remembered. That means upper division courses will be a little easier. And a lot more interesting as your knowledge becomes rich."
DecidingToBeBetter,375e7c,mattskelton,2,Mon May 25 03:39:52 2015 UTC,"This man knows that of which he speaks.   Let me add this: college is your primary occupation right now and as such, you should put in 40 hours a week to do well, varied of course by your load.  If you spend those daytime hours during the week chipping away at large projects, you can have less productive weekends. This isn't bad. This helps your brain rebound for each new week.   Spend the weekends doing something active and engaging. Read for leisure about your field. Read about things that are totally disconnected from your field.   Those who strike a workable balance are those who succeed without shredding their souls."
DecidingToBeBetter,375e7c,bingo-dingo,5,Mon May 25 04:53:57 2015 UTC,"Just reposting the same comment I made to your question in r/selfimprovement:  I would suggest if you're doing very well with college, it's not so bad to be less effective on weekends.  I would give yourself one day of the weekend of proper rest where you don't even think about college or studying. It could be a weekday as well if that works around your schedule better. Truly give yourself permission to not study on this day, so you don't feel guilty about it.  I'm not naturally very good at this either, but I always find when I allow myself time to properly rest and switch off, I'm less anxious and I come back to it the next day feeling more recharged and effective.  Hope this helps!"

DecidingToBeBetter,375e7c,breserk1011,2,Mon May 25 13:33:59 2015 UTC,"To echo everyone else here, don't feel bad at all about relaxing a little bit on the weekends! College is not only a time to fill your self up with academic knowledge but also to connect with people and grow into an adult. Make sure you don't neglect relationships, restfulness, and learning about your passions and hobbies while you are there.   When I was in college I would structure my day from soccer practice in the morning at 6 to soccer practice in the afternoon. Every minute in between would be structured and planned to make my day as efficient as possible. I would plan out my meals, rest times, and meetings around my classes and time to crank out work and then I would stick to that schedule religiously.   Once the afternoon soccer practice ended at 6:30 though, I would put all academic things on hold unless I had an exam or something urgent to finish. Otherwise, the rest of the night would be mine to engage in personal projects, meeting with friends, or just generally relaxing and planning out the next day. I would highly recommend getting a solid calendar app and planning out your day similarly!  That level of organization helped me to finish college with a dual degree while also playing a sport and still maintaining a solid social life and personal interests! I even managed to raise my puppy through senior year! Hope all of that helps and feel free to PM me if you have any questions!"
DecidingToBeBetter,375e7c,breserk1011,1 point,Mon May 25 15:43:58 2015 UTC,Thank you! :3 Which app do you recommend?
DecidingToBeBetter,375e7c,dizzzzzzid,2,Mon May 25 17:00:45 2015 UTC,I use Sunrise. I believe it's either free or $.99 on the app store. It lets you plan out events daily and you can pull up a weekly and monthly view to see what's ahead. You can also set reminders and sync it with google calendars so that whatever you schedule on one will automatically update on the other.   I like to have google calendar up on my laptop because it is color coded and easy to follow what's going on during the whole month on one page while using Sunrise to keep on track on a daily basis.

You might be used to focusing on the negative - which is how our brain evolved to survive. If you want to give it a go,  start by keeping a journal of wins -  each night write down three small victories.   I also recommend picking up the book Learned Optimism to enhance your resilience.  Keep in mind that there's ups and downs - one feeling won't last for ever. I'd recommend to start looking into working on that perfectionism.  It's one of those things that's both a beneficial and harmful.   Again,  congrats and good luck!"

More specifically, lose the idea that ""once I do X just the way I've wanted, I'll be satisfied"". That X is an ever-changing goal post that moves away just as fast as you can chase it. Point is, stop expecting to reach some homeostasis or equilibrium where all is well, because you never will, and if you constantly attempt that fruitless chase, you're ensuring you'll be forever disappointed.

It definitely makes socialising a little more difficult and even weird. When I had my account deactivated, people genuinely couldn't fathom that I didnt have it at the time."
DecidingToBeBetter,36ziw9,meukow,1 point,Mon May 25 06:41:38 2015 UTC,"When people tell me they don't have it they usually are on the lower spectrum of 'popularity'. We live in a digital age when social media accounts are something you must have or you're an outcast, so instead of trying to prove something and act independent when you're actually not, customise your Facebook properly and moderate it's usage so that you only get useful info from it and you do not miss on anything."
DecidingToBeBetter,36ziw9,Bdi89,1 point,Mon May 25 11:28:27 2015 UTC,"For some people, being on that spectrum of popularity at either end means little to nothing. Those who are more introverted and only have a small circle of friends might see little use or need for it. I don't think everyone who doesn't have one or deletes it is out to 'prove anything', but then again people who have deleted their Facebook tend to be very inclined towards dropping that fact unnecessarily in conversation. I personally just use it as a messenger and another way of reading interesting content."
DecidingToBeBetter,36ziw9,Rock-Shandy,6,Mon May 25 12:30:20 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem is people don't realize you can customise your feed to suit you, instead of looking at links to buzzfeed articles, you can change it so you have just your friends posts and some motivational stuff. It's very similar to reddit, /r/pics and /r/funny can take up your whole day if you let them so not subing to them helps.  I currently go on fb 3-4 times a day and each session is 3-10mins going through timeline, ~2mins in groups and 1-2mins going through messages (group chats are a pain sometimes). So I spend about 30-40mins a day on fb, which suits me fine."
DecidingToBeBetter,36ziw9,Wakken,3,Sun May 24 01:10:16 2015 UTC,I tried it a while back.  I thought it was great. After a while I felt as if I wasn't mindlessly checking my feed for no reason and saw a tangible improvement in my clarity of mind and productivity.

Now I recognize that some people are just casual friends, others have faded from memory. So ya, long run, 4 months now, I am better off. I have to put in effort to remember's people's birthdays around. (To be clear, I just removed my newsfeed and so I don't open facebook but still use messenger)"

It meant a lot to her that I showed up, but I almost couldn't.  Truth is, as much as you or I may dislike Facebook, it's the primary form of communication for a lot of people today. You can say that anything worth hearing you'll hear elsewhere, but that may not always be the case.

DecidingToBeBetter,36ziw9,beadingrose,1 point,Sun May 24 04:57:52 2015 UTC,I did this also. I actually realised I needed Facebook to find out when certain groups meet up so made a blank account to  join the groups check group every few day. I end up going through my Facebook list and realised there was only 20 people  that were not family I want to keep in contact with message them my number. I also deleted a lot of contacts off my phone. I was comparing myself to other people and wonder why groups of people I know didn't invite me out or tag me in invite posts. Facebook became like a chore that I had to do to keep up with how everyone was doing. Now I just message people ever few weeks to see how they are doing and about meeting up it feels more meaningful to me. The only downside is lack of access to private events my friends have posted so have to pry the information from them.

It wasn't difficult, and it wasn't ever tempting to go back. That being said, I was pretty annoyed with Facebook, how commercial it all was, how fake people were being, and how much I felt I had to censor anything I said. So it wasn't hard at all to give up."

But I only use it once a week just to go through notifications.  I don't use Facebook anymore, but most of my friends do.  I keep it around in case they want to contact me.  Anyway, research shows people are happier when not comparing yourself to others, and that's pretty much all facebook is: a way to examine people you know and inevitably compare yourself to them.  I don't miss that website one bit."

It's a little woo-woo, but give it shot.   Imagine that you're on a bus. It's crowded with people of all kinds. These people are all part of you, some aspect of you. The bus stops and you get off, and one of them gets off with you.   The one that gets off with you is the personification of this mental block. Imagine yourself having a conversation with this representation and go through these steps. Stay calm with it, and just listen to what comes up. What we're doing is taking something that's conceptual and making it more concrete so it can be worked with.  1) What does it look like? Is it male? female? and object? something else? What is it wearing?   2) Ask it what it's name is? If it doesn't have one, go ahead and name it.   3) Ask it: ""How are you trying to help me?""  Follow up: ""And through that, what do you want for me?""   4) Ask it if it would be willing to accomplish that in a way that's beneficial for you both.   5) Ask it if there's anything else it wants to say.   6) Finally, ask it something like this: ""What do you need for healing?"" or: ""What do you need to integrate into my psyche?""   7: Thank it and let it leave."

DecidingToBeBetter,36z6lv,Loftcolour,3,Sat May 23 10:46:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say that real change comes around like a body fights a cold. The body may tolerate it, but it is trying to push it back. Once the mind agrees, the cold is lifted. But, until both parties are in cooperation. Nothing will be done. The body either has to force the mind, or the mind has to force the body. Either way, its a difficult process and it will be one everyone has to face.  To catalyse this real change, the mind may take medicine. For us, that's motivation. But, it takes discipline and dilligence to fight back the cold, just like we need to fight back against everything that doesn't want to cooperate. We need to do it for ourselves. In a similar fashion, a task someone besides us sets isn't motivating because we didn't decide to, so I would say if you want someone else to experience change, the best thing to do is to let them set the goal and help them along that path.  In practice, I'd imagine this would work well in meetings, but this could also work with friends and family who don't want to cooperate with doing the task instead of deciding to do it."

A cold is a physical thing, a virus. Resistance to change isn't really a physical entity. Does it help to pretend it is, do you think? Steven Pressfield says so in The War of Art. I'm not sure either way."
DecidingToBeBetter,36z6lv,Katantunoro,2,Sat May 23 11:26:14 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what the plan is with my self-improvement course, that I'll be running over on my Blog.   I always say that if something doesn't physically exist, you can always personify it to make it so. In doing so, it almost always becomes an easier thing to handle. For instance, throughout history, death has almost always been personified, even though death itself is a concept. Death has no physical nature to it, yet we've created monsters such as the Grim Reaper. It sure makes it easier to explain and conquer right? It's no longer an abstract, but a cloaked skeleton with a large scythe who takes away people from this mortal coil.  I really like The War of Art. It really manages some big concepts well, I'd say. This personification is just another way to manage one of these concepts. I feel like he does a good job dealing with the concept of rationalisation, too. His work with the thought of ""Resistance"" too. I haven't read it fully, but I'm going to read through it properly once I've got my exams out of the way.   Why would you have doubts about it? Why do you think it doesn't help?"
DecidingToBeBetter,36z6lv,Katantunoro,1 point,Sat May 23 11:37:57 2015 UTC,"Well, on the one hand it helps to have an enemy; it helps us to marshall resources and target our efforts.   On the other, this enemy isn't physically real. It's a convenient fiction, so it's ""only"" helping us to trick ourselves into a fix. That's not the same as understanding the underlying reality and resolving the real problem."
DecidingToBeBetter,36z6lv,Katantunoro,2,Sat May 23 12:27:25 2015 UTC,"But surely, the entire start to becoming disciplined is to build up something to defeat?

So the idea is to encourage goal-setting and to anthropomorphise an enemy. In other words, to turn the problem into a fight or competition or game, in which you improve the likelihood of success by defining ""winning"" (and losing).   That's good, although (and this may not matter) it's not the same as the thing which happens when someone just wakes up fully determined to change. My limited experience of those moments suggests that it's something to do with realising that you're tired of tolerating a situation."

There's no costs, or anything, and it'll only take 3 hours of your time, weekly.   It starts June 8th, and it'll cover everything from finding out what you want to do with your life to coping with stress, and minor anxiety and depression (No promises on anything big for that, as if they are bad, then they need to bw treated with medicine, not advice) that will hopefully make people like you much more motivated and disciplined in doing what they really want to do, not just drinking or gaming your life away.  It's an awesome, simple course that I feel will be better than me listing off 10 things that you can do, because there'll be no pressure if you don't follow it, but if you're accountable to not only yourself, but everyone else who has read it and succeeded, you're really going to want to do it.

After that, there will be a 2 week period for people to mail in their problems and issues, and for them to share it with friends who are going through hard times. Anything that is asked during that time will be worked into the topics that will be covered. As it stands, week 1 will be ""finding yourself"", followed by productivity basics, then ""How to not give a fuck"". After that, there's 8 weeks worth of free for all where whatever someone wants me to cover something I will (and fit it into the grand plan so it's for everyone, not just that person) and that will lead into the final week which will be a time to recap. If I get at least 10 people following the course to the end, I'll then be giving out Internet certificates of awesome for those who did really well!  If you have anything that is specialised, I'll do mini-articles throughout the weekdays, but otherwise there will be a task to complete every Monday starting June 8th and ending August 31st. You have to complete every task for a certificate, and I bet you'll be really proud with yourself if you're dilligent enough to do all of the tasks!

In A Nutshell - Win People To Your Way Of Thinking   Principle 1 The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. Principle 2 Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, ""You're wrong."" Principle 3 If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. Principle 4 Begin in a friendly way. Principle 5 Get the other person saying ""yes, yes"" immediately. Principle 6 Let the other person do a great deal of the talking. Principle 7 Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers. Principle 8 Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view. Principle 9 Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires. Principle 10 Appeal to the nobler motives.

DecidingToBeBetter,36u52q,thirteenthirty7,3,Fri May 22 17:35:07 2015 UTC,"Feeling Good by David D. Burns M.D.  It's possible that this book may not be for everybody. One of it's subtitles is ""The clinically proven drug-free treatment for depression."" The author is a therapist and this book is one of the first that aims to teach the reader Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. The basic idea of CBT is that your feelings are dictated by the phrases you say in your head. An example is,""I'm no good."" A phrase like that makes a person feel bad. After reading Feeling Good, you know that the statement is an overgeneralization or a label. A more accurate statement would be, ""sometimes I make bad choices."" A statement like that doesn't make you feel wholly bad, but gives you a better marker for what you can improve. Also, you learn from this book that making bad choices doesn't make you inherently bad, because there's no way to even measure worth, so there's no literal way to add or detract from it. After all, ""I'm no good,"" begins to look like what it is: an irrational, useless thought. It does nothing positive for you to say this to yourself.   There's all kinds of other lessons about anger, perfectionism, do-nothingism and approval addiction. This book lead me on to other similar philosophical/psychological books like The Enchiridion by Epictetus and A Guide to Rational Living by Albert Ellis. All three books contained ideas that have helped me make numerous, gradual changes that jump started me out of depression and into a happier frame of mind."

The create structures to remind you of the goal you chose. And each day make progress towards that goal. Get around other people.

DecidingToBeBetter,36uxnc,BreakMyLimits,1 point,Mon May 25 12:52:54 2015 UTC,"There are! If we're not aware of them abs don't work with them,  we act out those beliefs unconsciously.  Many of them are a way to protect ourselves from pain,  but actually cause more in the long run.  Let's take the example of ""Everything I do has to be perfect."" This is often a more conscious surface belief -  in my experience the person is aware of that. And this person is usually overworked,  stressed out,  pushes to far,  and more.  If we explore though,  below that belief is probably another belief like ""If I make a mistake other people won't like me""  or ""I can't trust others to do it.""   At the deepest level,  a self-limiting belief is usually there to help us find some kind of happiness,  it just goes about it in a bad way.  It often is also something that worked well in the past -  such as from childhood - but no longer works the way it did (imagine a child who learns to get their way by crying.  Then 30 years later manipulating people is the only way they know,  only the results are now negative and cause lots of problems).   So as a concrete example ,  a client I was working with was a  people pleaser and perfectionist,  always helping everyone with whatever they needed and giving everything 110%. This came out of a belief to protect her from criticism, and deeper was a want to be joyful. Until she knew that,  she kept acting out her pattern and running herself ragged and having a lot of anger and criticism toward herself when she couldn't keep up. Now she knows about it,  and can put her energy toward what she values most instead of saying yes to everything.   Does that make sense?"

DecidingToBeBetter,36uxnc,Speelt,2,Fri May 22 12:49:25 2015 UTC,"The 10,000 hours thing is actually not 100% true.  For starters, it turns out that it only takes roughly 20 hours to have a fairy decent grasp at the topic. (Of course, this could depend on the topic)  Of course, it's not just... 20 hours of kind of trying at it. You need to actually put your time and a lot of effort into it.  From there, you just continue. The first 20 hours will be your biggest growth (usually), from there it'll be a small step at a time (which could possibly go unnoticed by the person learning).  While the sentiment is there, I wouldn't suggest going out and putting 10,000 hours into something expecting to come out as a master. You could become a master (once again, depending on the topic) in 3-4,000 hours instead.  The point is to consistently try, and don't try for results..Try for trying. Those results will come when they come, just make sure you're effectively doing whatever it is that you're learning, and being as tedious as possible in your practice.

Most people keep their promises to others more than to themselves. I suggest killing two birds with one stone and finding other people to make promises to and making promises that make you happy (find a buddy to go to the gym, find someone to eat lunch in the park with, ask someone to read Leadership and Self-Deception with you and talk about it, whatever you want).

Make a list of the things you want to change, with the most important at the top and the least at the bottom. This will give you a clear set of incremental goalposts that shouldn't overwhelm.  Attack your changes one at a time. When you feel like you've gotten problem one to a manageable place, start on problem two, and so on. Think of it like a coloring book: you don't just pick up all the colors and go to town, you do it one color at a time because that's a manageable approach.    It'll be tough: you'll make missteps and you'll likely find yourself very frustrated at times, even unknowingly slipping back into undesired behavior patterns, but when you realize that's happened, dust yourself off and start again.

DecidingToBeBetter,36rb9s,zedextol,7,Thu May 21 15:46:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say that the fact you've recognizing your dick-ish behavior was the biggest step in the process. Most people who are everything you've claimed to be never come to the realization that it ISN'T actually everyone else around them that's the asshole, it's them.  Overcoming a complete overhaul of who you are as a person isn't necessarily easy, but it's clear that you don't want to be that person anymore, and you want to be the person that not only your dream girl deserves to be with, but the person that you deserve to be as well.  One of the hardest 'pills' to swallow is admitting your wrong. A lot of times pride and spitefulness can get in the way, so just be mindful of your actions and what you're saying. You'll stumble every now and then, sure, but that doesn't mean you're still the person you don't want to be anymore.  I remember reading something on here not too long ago along the lines of, The reason the review mirror is smaller than the windshield, is because the life in front of you is more important than the one you're leaving behind.  It's a little cheesy, sure, but it's been a good reminder for me when I get down on myself, I can remember that I just need to keep moving forward and trying to better myself every day the best I can - it's really all you can do. It's also a reminder though, that not only are you leaving that life behind,it also helps to take brief looks back at where you used to be, and seeing that it's still behind you. Remembering where you used to be is a helpful tool so to speak, that can keep you grounded and focused on your goal. When you see yourself acting like a douche, remembering this time - the time when you were so miserable and lost and lonely and just wanted to be a better person, it can give you the kick in the ass reminder that you need to focus up, and stay on point toward your goal.  TL;DR: Taking responsibility for your dick-ish behavior and admitting you've been a douche is one of the toughest things for ANYONE to overcome. From here, every decision you make should be with the intention to better yourself, and becoming the person you want to be.  Good luck."
DecidingToBeBetter,36rb9s,CircaSurvivor55,9,Thu May 21 16:17:43 2015 UTC,"My first suggestion is to watch your language. You keep putting everything in present tense instead of past tense. That will just reaffirm your negative opinion. You were selfish, you were narcissistic. Choose who you want to be now. I hear kind, considerate, generous, loving, but you have to pick your own if you want them to stick.  Also, don't do this to get her back or to accomplish something. If you do it for external reasons you will most likely stop as soon as you get that thing or realize you can't have that thing. A donkey stops chasing the carrot when it gets it or when it figures out it's tied to a stick.  FInally, I recommend Leadership and Self-Deception by the Arbinger Press. Or, simply go out and start doing things for other people instead of yourself. Or whatever else would be true to who you decided to be now."

DecidingToBeBetter,36rb9s,max21214,5,Thu May 21 20:55:42 2015 UTC,"Hey buddy --  First of all, I want you to know that I feel you. I've been through something similar. I once pushed the person I cared about the most away from me because of how I acted. It was a hard, hard time but looking back I'm kind of greatful for it because it was the only thing that helped me wake up and realize what I was doing. Then I could truly start to work on myself.   First of all, I want you to understand that - while you are not a perfect person - you are very likely being overly hard on yourself. We're all selfish, man. We all fuck up. It's just part of being human. Perhaps you've got some deeper-set issues with negativity than others, but that's something you can work on and can change. You are not a worthless person. You are a flawed person, and the fact that you've realized this means you are one massive step ahead of very many people.  I've found through my own personal struggles that the only real way I've ever been able to improve myself is to learn how to love myself. Yeah, I know it sounds cheesy, but trust me -- it is really hard to make positive attitude changes when you're completely enveloped in self hate. I realize that may be difficult for you right now, but it's okay to go at your own pace. At some point - if you really want to not be an asshole - you'll have to like yourself. Love yourself, even. That love will affect all of your daily interactions in such a way that people will notice that you've become slightly less, well, dickish.   Changing your attitude in life is something that you can practice literally all the time, every day. I do it too. I struggle with depression, so sometimes if I catch myself looking out the window and thinking about how nobody likes me, I'll just focus on the people who I know like me and that I care about. Other times, if I pass a brusque-looking woman in the hallway and internally think ""wow I bet she's a huge bitch"" I'll catch myself and understand that I have absolutely no reason to think that. She's just a human, like me. She probably has flaws and probably has strengths like everybody else. There's absolutely no reason to judge her with so little information.   It will help you to start thinking of other people as... wait for it... people. They are living lives just as complex, joyous, exciting, boring, sad, and interesting as yours. Possibly more so. That annoying woman who took too long to order her food at McDonalds this morning? She's an amazing opera singer with two kids who she supports on her own. She has insecurities, triumphs, needs, and feeligns every bit as valid as yours. So did the asshole who passed you on the highway. Turns out, he might be more than just an asshole.  Once you start realizing that people are people, like you, you'll start to emphasize with them. As a species, humans are incredibly good at dehumanizing each other. Once you're aware of that, you can start to change that, at least in yourself. It's a lot harder to call someone a worthless shitstain when you think about them as a living, breathing human being.  Best of luck my friend."

What everyone else said is very good, but I didn't see anything about friendships, so I wanted to add that topic to the conversation.  Take a look at your friends. Are they positive or negative people? If they have similar traits to the ones that you want to change, you may need to break off some ties. It's much easier said than done, but it's up to you to evaluate what they add to your life. If your friends are people who possess qualities that you want to strive for, keep them around and learn from them!  In regards to the girl, let your actions do the talking. The more someone says ""but I've changed!"" the less people tend to believe it.  Take it slow, or you'll be on a rollercoaster of successes and setbacks. Good luck!"

This is going into neuroscience. Behaviors are learned and reinforced, and those neural pathways are strengthened. It might be uncomfortable, but doing anything else instead of what you've been doing will help start breaking your previous patterns. But please be patient with yourself - these things take time.

When we resist our feelings, we actually make them worse. In Buddhism this would be called the Second Dart (so you're feeling your emotions is the first dart, and second is the wishing they didn't have a big effect on you.) Sitting and just feeling the emotions may actually help (dumping them out on someone else probably won't). Bring the feeling to awareness, focus on where exactly you feel it in your body. How big is it? Does it have a shape? A color? Just sit with it, letting it be without judgement and explore. Is that part of you trying to tell you something?  More questions, since this is that I do for a living, lol   You mentioned preparing - If you were preparing for it, how would you like to go about it?   Also, if you want to be less negative and work with your emotions better, would you be willing to read a book?

There is nothing wrong with not getting carried away while in a good mood. I would say that's actually a good thing.  Just the same, it is also good to not get carried away by your bad moods.

Small things are stuff like: Having food in the house, having a job, having good coworkers, having air to breathe, transportation to get to work, toilet paper, working plumbing, all sorts of stuff.   It's a skill, so be patient with yourself - we have to train our brain to learn to focus on that stuff, since by nature it's looking for the negative stuff to avoid so it can survive (like tigers jumping out of the bushes at you.

Our brain is designed to find problems, but it can learn otherwise. If you want to give it a go, I recommend a ""win"" journal or gratitude journal. Each night before bed, write down 3 small wins or things you're grateful for. You can win at waking up, taking a shower, seeing a friend.

And you are (I hope) going to stay on them until a physician tells you otherwise. Just because you start feeling better and your thoughts are regulated doesn't mean you are fixed. It means the medications are working and doing the job that is required. If you go off of them you are going to end up right back where you were today.

Good luck taking control of your life and your body.

DecidingToBeBetter,36m9zh,smileycat,1 point,Wed May 20 20:01:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I know more about bi-polar disorder than OCD but you'll probably have to stay on the medication indefinitely once they find a cocktail that works for you. But this is a question you absolutely should ask your doctor. Or... if you at some point in your life are at a place where the OCD and anxiety are not something you are interested in keeping in check than you can go off them with a doctor's permission but whatever you do do not just hop off and on these things. Longevity is important for your treatment needs and these kinds of medications should not be treated like any over the counter pain killer or something. They demand respect and should be taken as directed and if you want to quit them they should be backed down as directed. Bouncing on and off of them can really send you into a spiral. Especially if there are any mood stabilizers or anti-depressants/stimulants involved. Please ask your doctor any questions no matter how stupid you think they might be because the better you understand what you're dealing with the more control over this you have. Like I said earlier, this is not your fault, it's totally out of your control, and by stepping up and dealing with this now you really are bettering yourself. It is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of and the more people who stand up and admit this is what they are going through the less people will feel shame for being on medication for anxiety/OCD/bi-polar and a host of other disorders that countless others are dealing with."

DecidingToBeBetter,36m9zh,Rakaith,2,Thu May 21 13:48:41 2015 UTC,"Will power is an awful lot like a muscle. It can get fatigued. You can't use sheer will power to change a behaviour or thought pattern that is too habitual. If you take on more than you can handle in this way, you're setting yourself up for failure - and when it happens, at least in the ways I've experienced it before, it is many times worse than a normal episode.  What I'd suggest is this. Create a file, and make note of your mood, and whatever else relates to this medication (ticks, impulses, obviously I don't know what the specifics are for you). Note how you are doing at least once a day, and after a couple weeks look back and see if it's helped you.  If the medication isn't doing anything for you, please look into an alternative, whether it be medical or therapeutic.   Your pride isn't worth your physical or mental health. That seems to be what's standing in your way. You might benefit from seeing a therapist to help with this, and/or the issues you're having that require the medication you've been put on."

I can't actually answer your question but I just want to say I'm in nearly the EXACT same situation.I'm 24 and currently living abroad but all signs point to me moving back in with my dad.   I am afraid to seek help because 1) the stigma 2) my pride.  If I go on medication I feel like I didn't try hard enough with meditation or organizing my life.  The same way I felt when I was in college and took Adderall.  In the back of my mind I don't feel that my degree is 100% legit because I took a pill for the last 2 years in order to not flunk out.    So I don't really have an answer but I want you to know I feel pretty much the exact same way, so hopefully someone here can give some good advice."
DecidingToBeBetter,36m9zh,Bdi89,1 point,Wed May 20 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"It can feel very stigmatising getting the prescription for, buying and staring at the packaging for psychotropic medication. I've recently started on a mood stabiliser for people with bipolar, as my recurring and chronic anxiety hasn't been helped one bit by traditional antidepressants. It still hasn't put much of a dent in my anxiety levels, but the concomitant depression has almost evaporated. It has made a huge difference to my life. Likewise, I have recently had to start using a CPAP (breathing device) at night for mild sleep apnea. Again, very stigmatising for a 26-year-old (sleep apnea is usually something more reserved for older, overweight/obese individuals who smoke, are sedentary etc).   Honestly, I have periods where I come around or don't. It is basically an issue of self-acceptance. What certainly doesn't help is social comparisons. Don't use Facebook and other social media to compare your behind-the-scenes to someone else's highlight reel. You are doing a fantastic job in self-care and are very strong for taking such a bold step. There are many people out there who instead self-medicate into oblivion out of fear of stigma.  Also, you'll be surprised to learn how many people are relying on medication and therapy these days. we can talk all we want about Big Pharma, but it does help lives. I was complaining about sleep apnea to my 27-year-old friend - turns out he has had rheumatoid arthritis since 22, and grows spurs on his feet that are excruciating and need to be cut out regularly. Most of us have some form of embarrassing or painful medical condition that develops at some form in our lives. Relinquish the egoistic side of yourself and give it some rationale - you'll be a bigger and better person for this. Good luck. :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,36m9zh,ms_fahrenheit,1 point,Wed May 20 23:53:20 2015 UTC,"My partner is very similar to you. He has really severe anxiety - so much so that my dad who is a GP was quite taken aback by how bad it was.   He refuses to get help from a doctor or counsellor or to take medication because to him, these things feel like giving up and admitting weakness, or that he is ""broken"" in some way. He has suffered from mental health issues since childhood and he gains his strength from the fact that no matter how close he was to oblivion, he always just about managed to pull himself through.   My own two pennies' worth is similar to what others have said, but:  The way Western society views mental health is fucked up. We don't fully understand the biology of mental health problems yet (and I'm no scientist) but there is very good reason to believe that some people's biological makeup means that they are far more likely to suffer from certain mental health problems than others. People often say that those with MH problems just need to ""grow up"" or ""get over it."" This is total bull - these thoughts have a considerable biological basis, so you can't control a considerable portion of them!   You are not broken, weak or a lesser person because of your OCD and anxiety. In fact, your mental health is nothing to do with what kind of person you are. Your mental health does not define whether or not you are a good person, a kind friend, a beloved relative. I have recently come out of hospital because an artery in my stomach lining didn't develop properly and burst, bleeding into my stomach. I didn't do anything wrong or unhealthy that caused it - I was just unlucky that my blood vessels didn't form properly and I'm not a lesser person because of it. Same goes for the brain. There is nothing wrong with you as a person and it is not your fault that you're suffering: your brain just works a little differently from the mainstream. Because of that, sheer will power will only get you so far.   I have watched (and am still watching) my partner struggle with the same war that you are battling now. When you have long-term issues with anxious and obsessive thoughts, it feels amazing when you can temporarily beat them down and can be free from them for a minute, an hour, a day, a week. However, this cannot be your only source of pride and self-esteem. As you're starting to discover, you can't beat this through willpower: you need help. Help to be the best that you can be. You probably have loads of other things to be proud of besides your willpower - you are so much more than that. Be proud of your actions, your skills, your relationships with others. Your pride in your willpower has been a coping mechanism so far, but now it's standing in your way. If you want victory, you need to completely overhaul your sense of self and dig deeper for the holy grail of self-esteem. When I tell my partner that he should be proud of the fact that he is one of the kindest, most empathetic people on this earth with a lightning-speed brain and enviable musical talent, he cries and tells me that he has no idea how to love himself and that it's an impossible and hopeless task. I don't know if that's how you feel too. Are you totally lost on how to start appreciating yourself for who you are because you're so used to relying on your willpower to feel good? Almost everyone struggles with self-esteem, neurotypical or not. It will be hard, but you're not alone.  If the war feels overwhelming, just remember that you've already begun the offensive. You've been to the doctor, and you have a prescription in hand. Whether or not the meds work for you is not actually the main issue here - what's amazing and so, so important is that you've finally accepted help, despite your pride. Take the meds and keep talking to your doctor.  You're already getting closer to victory. Keep going."

I was very nervous about starting medication, too, but I had reached a point in my life where I could not function in my every day life.   So I released myself of the responsibility of making the right choice, and decided just to listen to my therapist and psychiatrist. I was going to follow orders until I felt better or knew it was the wrong path.  Don't misunderstand...starting meds is not an instant fix. It takes time for them to help, and sometimes, you have to figure out which med is right for you, and which dose.   BUT, if you hang in there...you will be surprised at how well you can feel. I feel like myself again, after giving meds a solid chance. I don't know what will happen when I start to wean off, but honestly, I'm not worried about it. I can take as much time as I need.

I keep booking my weekends up with gym classes, coffee catch ups and taking myself to something I want to do alone. Half the time I feel insanely guilty about doing it without having him then and half the other time I feel good that I'm doing something for me.   I'm dreading the moment someone takes an interest in me. I don't know how to response. I'm going to assume I will probably become quite distressed and emotional as I haven't done so since the break up.

He said after the summer is over he'd love to pick back up again, but says he can't ask me to wait for him because it'd be wrong of him? Idk. I'm torn between believing he might want to give it another chance later and the fact he was probably just bullshitting me to make me feel better in the moment.  I was SUPER sad for about a week. Couldn't sleep, eat, or do anything basically. And then it just hit me, why am I wasting my energy being upset and depressed over this when I KNOW he is fine and leaving me was easy for him? So just like that I snapped out of it. Thinking about that made me even more determined to move on. If he isn't hung up over me, there is no point in me being hung up on him, you feel?

Just because you go on a date doesn't mean that you're going to marry that person. As long as your date knows that you aren't looking for anything serious maybe getting out of the house is a good thing. But I understand your reluctance. I can't imagine being with someone and having them try to kiss me or be affectionate. It's okay to say that you're not ready.

Because trying to hold onto that future with the person you love -- they've changed and you grew apart -- is like failing before you've even started. I know we are strangers on the internet but I'm happy for you. Some days you will go back to missing him because finding someone else is taking too long.

But I recently sat down and realized that this is all part of the journey of living. Years from now, I imagine we'll both look back and chuckle at how we thought we were supposed to have everything together at this age. Its crazy that we're supposed to think about what we want to do with the rest of our lives beginning at age 18. It really makes no sense lol.  So slow down and relax. Take some time and try some new activities. And don't worry so much about your parents. Sometimes they are a great resource and are able to guide you where you need to be.

Most people take shit jobs coming out of school.  Very few are doing what they really want to be doing just out of college, and most people have no clue what they really want in life when they're 50.  So stop being so hard on yourself, take some perspective.  Why not just try some different jobs in the real world?  Studies won't show you what it's really like, and just because you don't excel in class doesn't mean you'll fail at the job.  Get something that lets you pay the bills and do some exploration.

One thing I noticed is that you often decided what to pursue (or not) by the grades you get. It seems as if you often look outside of yourself for direction as opposed to going inside yourself. So maybe, stop taking tests, stop researching, and just spend some time with yourself. If you have a journal, even better! Think about what you really want. If money, time, education were not a factor. Even if it seems unrealistic. Then, look for patterns in what you wrote. Or think - what can do you for hours that doesn't even feel like work? What do people always ask you to help with? Nothing is wrong with you. Only that maybe you haven't been trusting your inner voice enough. Good luck!"

I know my mom generally thinks I quit every time things get hard, but the way I see it, I don't quit because it gets hard, but because I don't have the biggest interest for it, or I lose interest for it.   Quitting something when you lose interest in it is a dangerous trap. Now I'm not saying to stick with something for the rest of your life, no matter what, even if it's detrimental to you. I am saying though, that if you want a long term relationship, if you want to pursue something that will make a difference in your life, if you want long-term happiness or satisfaction, or anything else lasting or worthwhile, this habit will prevent it.  Giving your word to something that inspires you, and then keeping it even when the inspiration wanes, is a critical skill. I train people to regenerate that enthusiasm, and that if they are not going to do what they said to create something that leaves those impacted actually happy about the situation. You can use whatever technique you like (including, ""I'm going to finish because I said I would, period.""), but I highly, highly recommend digging deeper into this habit and look where else it shows up and the impact it has.  And yeah, don't beat yourself up. You sound like a normal person dealing with life the best you can."

Martial arts classes (in my case karate, anything will do though.): Up your confidence, improve your fitness, learn self-defense, etc., in my honest opinion there's just so much good in martial arts as a whole on a physical, mental & even spiritual level. Get fit (Gym, running, etc.): You could go to the gym, though I personally prefer the body weight fitness route. I started biking as well, but if you aren't into that you could start running, skateboarding, long boarding, surfing, so on. Meditation: Admittedly I myself am new to this, but I've been enjoying the little time I've spent meditating so far. According to everything in the world, it would appear it yields a bunch of benefits so why not? Reading: Ehh, don't think I need to go into very much detail about why reading is entertaining & good for you.   I also recommend doing a lot of overall self-improvement stuff, fixing my posture, eating healthier, and so on. Challenging and improving yourself is a lot of fun I've found, but who knows if you will feel the same.  Edit: reddit formatting is kind of weird."

If most of the people around you loves sports (and really, for most in the U.S. at least, that's usually a replacement for the weather - a neutral subject most everyone knows a little about) go find other places to be. Go to a game store, go to a club on a night when a huge local match is going on, etc. I promise you can find many people with little interest in sports.

DecidingToBeBetter,36ints,Skryym,1 point,Wed May 20 20:10:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think most people you would really like to know abhor small talk as well. So start sorting the wheat from the chaff as quickly as possible. Ask questions like, ""What's the most awesome thing about you?"" or ""What's the thing you most want to see happen, but feel like you can only accomplish with the help of others?"" Those who want to dig in and talk about the real parts of life will love you for asking. The rest, don't worry about."

Maybe it's a type of clothing, or a hobby, or an animal.  The people you respect, love, and care for...  Why?  Do they have their own hobbies and endeavors that you look up to?  I think we tend to surround ourselves with close friends and family because we share common threads, not just blood or good times.  See if you can find that out!"
DecidingToBeBetter,36ints,Rlamb2,1 point,Tue May 19 18:33:07 2015 UTC,"Well I like learning about mythology and tinkering with/building things but there's always a small part of me that just thinks they're passing fads so I end up talking myself out of it before I talk. And also that my financial and living situations don't really lend themselves to just up and start working on any projects. I know it's stupid and counter intuitive but I think it's also a sign I may not be as into that stuff as I think, if I'm not able to make myself take the plunge  As for your second point, that's part of the problem. I'll keep it short and just say I don't really surround myself with people anymore. I've never had anything to talk about and my family and I aren't really close at all. Having people with similar interests is the one big thing I want out of life, instead of me just mimicking the interests of people around me"
DecidingToBeBetter,36ints,mstephans,3,Tue May 19 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're working really hard to ""get it right"". Like there is a true interest you were born for. I advise you to simply persue what ever excites you. Don't worry if its a passing fad or if it might not be your life's driving purpose. That's way too much pressure. Simply declare that it's what you're interested in right now, and devour it, until it's not.   Mythology and Building Stuff are awesome. Go do that. Find like-minded meetups or friends (where do people who build things hang out? Go there. Where do people who enjoy mythology hang out? Go there.) and be in the company of others."

I'm totally trying my hardest to get it right because frankly I don't believe I'll ever be happy with myself until I do. And I'm not a teen anymore, I'm starting to think more about my future and how I want people in it. And I reckon most people wouldn't like being around me if not even I like being around myself!  I'll keep your advice in mind though, the pressure has actually been worse on me than the fact that I have nothing to do.   As far as meeting up with like minded people, that's a little trickier! I live in a fairly lightly populated area so special interest groups/meetups are scarce. Though I suppose taking a class of some sort would fall into those lines, yeah?"
DecidingToBeBetter,36ints,jmorgan1321,3,Tue May 19 21:13:57 2015 UTC,"Just based on the mythology and building stuff thing, have you looked into any comic/sc-fi conventions near you?  They usually only happen once a year, but it's a LOT of fun to build a costume for one while you wait, then you put it on, no matter how crapy it may be and go!  Just walking around will result in people asking for pictures (especially if it's a recognizable creature/character) and you can find others dressed like you to compare notes on how you built said costume!  It sounds super nerdy (it is) and maybe a little lame (it's not) but it's a WHOLE hell of a lot of fun!"

Just a word of caution, I think that your current mindset is going to work against you here, as well. It will be incredibly easy to identify why things won't go how you wish they would. And that will apply double to advice from strangers on the internet (after all, you know your circumstances way better then we do). Catch yourself when you identify why ""it"" won't work, or what the difficulties are. The key in this is just to take actions, regardless if they are the ""right"" answer. I promise there are like minded people around you, likely with the same concerns. Go find them! And let us know how it goes!"
DecidingToBeBetter,36ints,BreakMyLimits,1 point,Wed May 20 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"I think you should look at how you spend your time.  If you're actually passionate about something you're going to be spending a lot of time doing it.  Not talking about it, not reading about it, not thinking about doing it, but actually doing it.  I think that's the best way to go because it's easy to get sidetracked by the stuff other people have told us are worthy enough, or make people rich, or are hip, arty, or cool.  Those things are things that people feel good about themselves for doing, the way you might feel virtuous for choosing a salad over hot wings. But that's not necessarily coming from you, just from culture and family and friends.  The stuff you think is important is the stuff you make time for.  If you're into music, you're going to be playing or listening to music.  If it's science, you're always reading about it, learning about it, using it,etcetera.  The stuff that you think you're supposed to be into but aren't are things you talk about doing or start but don't finish or read about doing but don't start.  Millions of people dream of being an author, but never really write anything.  Because it's about the media image of an author, not the act of writing that they're in love with.  If it was about writing, they'll write."
DecidingToBeBetter,36i1xl,kennilicious,3,Tue May 19 15:22:46 2015 UTC,"Only question, why would you exercise after showering? I get that 60 pushups and a minute of wall-sit isn't exactly going to leave you drenched in sweat, but it seems weird that you wouldn't do this before showering. Perhaps you can do the 60 pushups first, then go turn on the shower, then do a 1-minute wall sit, and then shower off. Just my two cents.  Edit: wanted to add, I really like the ""three things I'm grateful for"" idea. It's a simple task, and even if only done once a week, I feel like it can really help you get perspective on what's important in your life. Nice job!"

DecidingToBeBetter,36fvnm,shydominantdave,8,Wed May 20 02:02:20 2015 UTC,"It's good advice. These three advices are all somehow grounded in evidence based methods/theories. Number two and three, for example, are studied in positive psychology.  If you think number three is hard, try writing it down first, it can take a while to start noticing the positive things in life/about yourself so it may help when you have the time to think about instead of having someone watching you think. Make the list and then tell your father.  Great advice, but most important, see if it does anything for you after the experiment is over and keep doing the things that help.   edit: and about #3, maybe it's easier to list positive things of that day in general. Enjoyed a cup of coffee? had good time with friends? recieved a compliment? finished that essay? enjoyed some quiet time by yourself? write it down. This may be easier in the beginning and less confrontational if you can't think of anything/much."

DecidingToBeBetter,36ef9h,luellasindon,2,Tue May 19 11:52:55 2015 UTC,"You know what, though? I think that depends on the context. You can't ""Decide to be Better"" from your illness - so asking someone to look on the bright side of an illness (especially one with long-term effects/no cure) is insensitive. However, someone who is chronically ill can still ""Decide to be Better"" as a person overall, and downplaying negativity is a part of that."
DecidingToBeBetter,36ef9h,SavageGoatToucher,1 point,Tue May 19 12:56:01 2015 UTC,"That is true, but when you are dealing with a chronic illness your entire existence revolves around downplaying negativity. If someone who is chronically ill is saying something negative, they are at or near the end of their rope and having their problems trivialized with what is essentially ""it could always be worse!"" is infuriating."

You have an affirmative obligation to yourself -- to your sanity, to your friends and family -- to give yourself a little slack, to have a modicum of fun, to exercise, etc.   That said, what have you tried? Can you block out a chunk of time to do the online learning? Write yourself a curriculum? 25 minutes from 6:35 till 7:00 pm, M - Th? And if that works, add more? Keep a chart of your progress: don't beat yourself up if you need to skip a day, but see if you can't get at least 90% ""attendance""? After two weeks (still a total of less than 5 hours), make a determination of whether you've done enough, want to increase your obligations, etc?  Have you tried productivity software? A pomodoro timer?  How about a rule like ""no video games outside 8 - 10 pm?""   Is this social? Can you report on yourself to a friend who wants you to succeed but isn't so annoying (or easily annoyed) that this will be a major negative? A parent? A sibling?"

I was coming here to recommend getting a to-do app that you really like (try Glass Planner if you're on iPhone, or anything where you can set up a reoccurring task) and put whatever you want to do in there and set it up to trigger every Mon, Weds, Fri for example.  If you go to my Glass Planner you'll see ""25 minutes of Twitter"" three times a week, ""Catch up on /r/coffee"" once a week, ""Read through my Instapaper highlights"" once a week, and this really helps me stay on track with things.   I don't know about anyone else but I find that if I make a habit of doing this I really stick to it because it feels so great to tick things off of my to-do list.   As was said above, try tomato-timer or just use your phone to set yourself a time limit for each activity. Telling yourself you'll give yourself only an hour to do something really helps boost productivity.   Then you can add the procrastination stuff that you like to do but always add a time-limit in the title: ""25 mins of reddit"", ""60 mins of v-game with friends"".   This helped me enormously.. and yeah it sounds like a really rigid way to set up my week but man, I've gone from a hopeless procrastinator to a much more focused Internet user :-)"

DecidingToBeBetter,36e6es,The_Big_Mang,3,Tue May 19 18:58:10 2015 UTC,"Consider that you only have so much 'productivity' in you.  If you're giving 100% at work you probably don't have as much to give at home.  That being said, you can always do better or at least try to give more at home.  Here's how I'd start -  Set a rule for yourself.  Something like 'No TV / laptop / phone / computer electronics' whatever it is for 1 hour after you get home.  Consider using that 1 hour for things like cleaning or maybe cooking or getting projects done around the house.  I find that once I start doing a project, I will keep doing projects until I fall out of the routine (IE: on Monday I fixed the bathroom fan.  I felt so good that on Tuesday I fixed the old broken drawer in the junk room.  That went so well on Wednesday I painted the bathroom.  Things looked so nice on Thursday I built a flower box for the wife.  on Friday I went out with my friends and didn't do anymore projects again!)  After you get used to dedicating 1 hour of your time to being productive, you can try splashing in the photoshop, fruityloops, or duolingo for one of those hours.  If you find that you're straying from task, stop, and go back to something 'physical' until it's set in your brain that the 1 hr is 'productive time'.    Finally, if you can, extend that time to 2 hours.  I've managed to get to the point where I am not allowed to do computer or tv stuff until after 10:00 PM (I work 8AM-5PM).  I use my after work time to include 'self help' things like the gym and leading a walking group.  Anyway, don't expect 100% 'at home' effort, but progress will come!"
DecidingToBeBetter,36e6es,therespectablejc,1 point,Mon May 18 20:21:31 2015 UTC,"This advice only works if you have the extra cash to make it work, but here goes:  Don't go home. Home is for you (and me) a place to loaf about, basically a simple food repository and a bed to sleep in. So instead of duolingo, take a class/join a club. Instead of photoshop, join a club and learn to take a better picture in the first place. Instead of fruityloops, take a music lesson. Basically you need to take your hobbies away from the computer and out the front door with you. That's my advice for you."

DecidingToBeBetter,36b0p5,Stiltskin,10,Mon May 18 05:16:17 2015 UTC,"Agree with anti-FB sentiments, generally. Although I believe it's good if you can get to a place where you don't feel threatened or intimidated or insecure about what others are doing. Note I'm talking to myself as well here. This is a huge problem for me.   Also - I can do you a favor and put that feeling of inadequacy, that feeling of being ""lesser as a person,"" under impartial scrutiny. I'll do that by telling you that college has very little to do with success. Sure, you can look at income correlations as much as you want, but that's just our society and cultural narrative reinforcing itself - it may even be darker and more malevolent than that, there's a lot of money to be made sending naive kids into holes tens of thousands of dollars deep in debt. Point is, you define what success means to you. Don't let our society's bullshit machine do it for you. Money, career, status, property, and advanced degrees have no intrinsic value. What is valuable is you and what you can give to the world in whatever form you choose.   I was one of those very young, naive dickheads posting graduation pics to FB when I graduated a few years ago. Fast forward 4 years and one advanced degree later, and my years spent in college and grad school plague me with regret and self-loathing on a daily basis. I have a job in my field, but I don't have much money and I'm 50k in debt. I'm looking for alternative careers, I'm lonely living in a city with no friends and I struggle with depression. This is just a personal anecdote, but hey, it's something. On the worst days, it's hard to convince myself that going to college has brought me anything but a shitload of debt and biting self-doubt. Fuck, I certainly don't feel successful.   Good for you for dropping out due to ""financial difficulties."" At least you were honest with yourself. Me, I didn't even conceptualize that student loans were real money until the payments started taking chunks out of my bank account.   Seriously, fuck college. Fuck externally imposed definitions of success. Express yourself, value who you are and what you can do for others."

From now on, it's just going to be sunshine and rainbows, right?  Ha. As if.  Those people may have a degree, but they likely have not yet faced up to the challenges of the real world: the difficulties in finding a job, the increasing responsibility of adulthood, the need to pay the bills, the realization that the things they learned in college are only a small part of what it takes to be a stable, well-rounded person.  They're about to face up to the reality that you, my friend, have been living in for years now. They're about to realize that graduating from college isn't the end point to their success, but just the beginning. And this is the stuff that quarter-life crises are made of. I'm willing to bet that you're way ahead of them in terms of facing up to these kinds of challenges.   Granted, I'm painting with a pretty broad brush here, and I might be taking a rather uncharitable view of your friends. But most people end up having to deal with these things at some point or another, and it sounds like you just had to deal with them sooner than they did.   So you should be proud. If you've accomplished things despite not graduating from college, you should absolutely be proud of that. Because navigating the real world is immensely more difficult than college.   Forge your own path, whatever that may be. And don't bother comparing the details of your life to someone else's highlight reel."

So yeah, a lot of my friends from school who were in my higher up classes have all done Uni and many are living the high lives. I'm still lodging at my aunt'a house, only just learning to drive, and still reassembling the good me who I lost during my later adolesance. Fat, damaged social skills, bad habbits and bad attitudes. All needs to be ironed out.  So, that'a your first priority. Bettering yourself. If you're happy with yourself then awesome! Job done! Time for the next step.  Next step, at least for me, is looking somewhere else for a future than I had my life before now. My prospects were academic, and then whatever the fuck from there. Now, I've pretty much accepted that I wont be going the accademic route. Maybe in my 30s I'll take a few part time courses, but for now, I need to build myself some foundations.  So, where I come from, the answer to that is a trade. Electrician, plumbing, brick layer, whatever. Save up a few grand and take a college course. Then use your new specs to get into the business, and just work hard at that. Give it 10 or 20 years, you can have your own business.  And for the mean time, do what I do and unfollow your successful friends lol. I know thats bitter and avoids the problem but you dont go to Facebook to feel bad about yourself.

This can be many things, some of the things I have tried, with my personal results:   Meditation: visualizing what you want in life and asking yourself the things that you need to do to make them happen. I found I was sometimes holding myself back in my thoughts because of love for my family or things I liked doing. But you have to be cut-throat. If you feel your mortgage is tying you down, get rid of it. If you feel your job isn't exactly what you want to do, quit. If you have negative people in your life, cut them out, don't respond to their calls or msgs. Who cares? Life is too precious to be wasted. Like Steve Jobs had said: if you were going to die tomorrow, what are the things you'd change? Change in diet: /r/keto folks will tell you that almost completely cutting out carbs change your life. It's been the case for me too. In the last month that I've been on this diet (on-and-off), eating butter often, drinking coffee with a tonne of cream, I'm been WIRED. My coworkers notice the difference, and honestly, we've been killing it since. And if you're doubtful of this diet, all I ask is, do it for 3 days. It will be hard but if we can't change something so fundamental as our diet, just for 3 days. We are getting way too comfortable. Go visit the gym: I don't know if you hit the gym at all. But if you don't  have the habit of craving the gym, just go to the gym and sit somewhere and watch people do their thing. For 3 days. I swear to you, by day 3, you'll be so pumped to hit the gym. And when you do, set the treadmill to interval (something that stretches your limit) for 10 mintues and TOIL through it. Like, BEAT that machine. Finish that 10 minutes even if you're crawling. Then do some weights and push your body to what you thought was impossible. And, keep this as your habit. Because a better body gets you so far! Look at what others do: people like Dave Asprey, Sam Harris, Tim Ferris have spent a tonne of time and money hacking themselves. Take tips from them, read/hear their books/videos. They're much older than I am, so I bet you, it's not an age thing. I have met a 80yo Buddhist monk who travels 10 countries every month, making our achievements look like peanuts.   (bonus) 5. Have a night out: after you've started feeling the change, and feeling amazing, take the people you love out. Enjoy the camaraderie with your brothers/sisters who live for positive experiences. And if you've got the hookups and trust, you may experiment with things that people in /r/Psychonaut/ talk about. And before you judge their experiences, please understand that the point of all this is to take you out of average day-to-day experience and show you other possibilities that you're not aware of.

Even if you can't catch a wave just sit out there and oscillate up and down with each wave on your board.  Feel the sun on your face and the cool water gliding past your toes.  Hear the rhythmic sounds of the ocean meeting earth.  Something about it brings on a cognitive shift.  I sound like a total hippie I know but I know you'd benefit from some quality time out there.
DecidingToBeBetter,3697li,silverrain64,2,Sun May 17 17:36:16 2015 UTC,You are right there is something magical about the ocean.  Something that makes you feel part of something bigger than yourself.  Although I don't live near the sea it might be worth a few hours drive.  I had not thought of it but I know exactly the feeling you mean and it's the feeling that gives me inspiration.  I used to love to sit on the porch when i was a kid and feel the power of storms  as they rolled through. I used to pretend to be a power ranger but maybe I was  on to something.  Perhaps i have just been cut off from the power of nature too long and starting to stagnate.

I'm a medical hypnotist myself and I saw a client last year that was describing exactly the type of life you are. Just a feeling of having lost their 'spark'. Because you've had it once before, it's relatively easy to get back again, especially with a bit of hypnosis.   You could also get it back following a lot of the other advice people have mentioned on this thread, but I think a session or two of hypnosis is the 'fast' way to do it. :)"

There's a lot of napping and walking. Maybe some rowing. Usually it takes a few weeks of really paying attention to my head and my body to figure out the direction. Sometimes it's just a day or two.  Then I spend some time figuring out how to start moving in whatever new direction.    Fyi- it's rarely something life changing that I need to fix.

Also, use the ""yes and"" idea to build on other people's jokes. Don't just wait for a lull so you can deliver the line in your head.

DecidingToBeBetter,3678we,Stuck_in_Limbo44,32,Sat May 16 21:06:46 2015 UTC,"Your situation is not totally unique so dont get too down on yourself about it.  I recently attended a seminar led by a highly successful consultant who told a story about having to work at a 7-11 to get by eventhough at the time she had two masters degrees.  I also knew a guy who had a PhD in non-linear particle physics. Hes doing really well now, making a great living doing work he loves. for years before that though, he worked at a taco bell because he didnt think he could earn a living using his brain.  I went through it myself, busing tables at an Olive Garden for $6.50 + tips when I was 30, with a college degree. Im a releatively smart guy, just made a lot of bad decisions and had a lot of ineffective thinking and habits. Shits way better now, but for a while I had to surrender to the humbling exoerience and do it for a few years. Looking back it was a lesson in acceptance. I was doing the best I could and was probably one.of the few jobs I could hang onto despite the mess id made of my life at the time.  Thats mainly what it comes down to is clear thinking, effective success-focused habits and having some good role models. Role models as in finding people who have the life style, values, type of personality/character you'd like to have and studying how they do it. Now matter what your goal is, there is already someone out there doing it. Find them and learn from them.  Also, dont down yourself for your position. Getting into a managment position regardless of the industry demonstrates leadership quakities. Thats something that you can leverage to get yourself into a better position in life.  You can turn things around for yourself relatively quickly. A vision for your life that inspires will help you get there faster. So figure out what you need to do to forward in the short and midterm and figure what really excites you and make a plan to go for it. Then do it. And get other people involved and rooting for you irl like youre  doinghere on reddit :) sharing your challenges and success and failure  with other people can be a really powerful.thing becuase you never know when youll affect.someone else's life in a deep and meaningful way."

DecidingToBeBetter,3678we,asterixpro,4,Sun May 17 10:41:47 2015 UTC,"First thing I would do is go to your local community college and get some information about the things that interest you and go from there. I'm not sure about technical school, but I'm sure you can find info online. Oh and try talking to a counselor at the community college and tell him/her your interests and see if they can recommend some sort of path. It's also cheaper for you to be there, so let's say you take intro to tech (I have no idea what classes you'd be taking, just throwing out an example), and you end up hating it. I guess what I'm trying to get at is that you can take different classes and see what peaks your interest."
DecidingToBeBetter,3678we,Dusas,7,Sat May 16 22:35:35 2015 UTC,"Here's what I have done in the past, and what I would do in your current situation because that is not a fair wage by any stretch: * 1) Don't quit your job, yet. * 2) print flyers with tear off numbers and a cool picture offering computer services (Repairs. Troubleshooting. Virus, Malware and popup removal. Networking. Data backups. OS installs. Parts advice and supply) and put them up around your area/ wherever you are willing to travel to. Community noticeboards, power poles, wherever you can put them.  Make it clear that there is a $30 callout + $25 per additional hour. * 3) Buy yourself a couple of 2TB USB drives * 4) Create a few bootable USB rescue sticks (Trinity rescure kit, hirens boot CD and a couple of easy to learn linux distros)  Soon you will start getting calls, just tell people you are booked up until time X, with that time being when you finish work or before you start for the day and go and sort out their shit. In my experience, home PC repair is never difficult, but can be time consuming. You'll need to decide if you are willing to take people's PCs home or just work at their place, but be upfront about the timeframe to completion. These things take longer than you might think and if you do it at their place, your time is taken up so you have to charge them. I sometimes found it better to do it at my place so I could do other things during installs etc, but I don't know if you have a vehicle.  It takes a while to get your name out there, but word of mouth is powerful, so is advertising. Craigslist, gumtree, whatever you have.  If somebody asks about upgrades, yes, you can do that. Order parts off ebay and come back to install when they arrive or buy locally if you can get a good price. (wholesale status is easily achieved).  Soon you will have a bit of extra money:  *5) choose a few quality bits of gear and buy them from china (aliexpress, DX.com, banggood.com), add those to your flyers. I'm talking LED torches, UHF radios, Computer peripherals, whatever.  Congratulations, you now own and run your own business. Don't be shy of approaching small business owners in your area with a card, their problems are generally not that much more difficult.   As well as making extra/ better money depending how you go, if you do this for a couple of years you will be extremely surprised the impact this will have on your employment prospects. I once scored a 90K per year job based solely on the fact that I was running my own small business whilst maintaining study and other employment.   Many will disagree with me, but at 24 years of age the prospect of completing another degree or starting from scratch with your studies seems like a bum steer. You need to be making money, now. I'm assuming you're in the states; from what I've read you are not even guaranteed a living wage there once you've got a degree (and a pile of student debt).  All the best."

Sorry to hear. :( But there are two things to sort out here: there's money, and there's finding work (ie. a vocation) you love. You want to end up ticking both boxes - so that means making sure you're on the right path to doing that.    You're clearly a hard worker and you really care about fixing this. Put those things together, and that means you can fix this. But as Dusas said in another comment - it's important to nail what you want to do, as well as what you can do. If you want to do it (plus, if you've done your homework into the money side of it), you'll have the mental stamina to stick at it until it pays off, and it'll give your depression a good kicking along the way. It'll make you feel like you're in control again - and on a mission to fix your life.  You're in a position of power right now (it might not feel like it, I know) because you're employed and that gives you the financial freedom to look around, try things out in your free time, and see how they feel. You have the breathing-space to get this right. So start tomorrow.  The other thing I'd say is, look for people in the field you want to end up working in, and ping them an e-mail. Reach out and ask for advice and see if they respond. Get the reassurance you need, and ask for their stories, how they got to where they are now.  That might be just the inspiration you need."

It makes you aware of what you care about. Have you checked out ""The War Of Art"" by Steven Pressfield? He equates days like this to a victory for Resistance - the malign force inside that wants to pull everything apart. Every day is a battle to be won or lost, and while the war is never won, every day gives you the chance to win another important victory that adds up to meaningful progress. And - one of the weapons Resistance uses is comfort. Comfort dulls awareness, ambition, momentum.   If there's something on your To Do list and it's making you break out in a sweat, and you find yourself avoiding it...do that first, any way you can. The emotional payoff will be awesome, and it'll help you tackle the next thing, and the next thing, and the next...  Discomfort usually points a way out of itself."

Iv played for the last 15 years, iv played in bands, iv studied the greats, obsessed over what makes Hendrix a god, played until my fingers literally bled.   The reason I wanted to play guitar, was because after I heard AC/DC for the first time, there was nothing in the world more important to me than learning how the little guy in the school boys outfit did the things he did. I was obsessed.   Learning an instrument has nothing to do with giving you self worth. In fact if you do it right, you'll always feel inferior to the people you looked up to. You'll never be good enough, you think of all the time and energy you put in to it and realise, it was a wasted, and that could have been better spent learning something useful."

DecidingToBeBetter,35xetr,purpleball007,3,Thu May 14 09:04:33 2015 UTC,"Success isn't a bad thing. Even this sort of self obsession. Many ""greats"" had this quality to them from before they reached this. Madonna said that ""she knew she wanted to be somebody."" Freddie Mercury said ""I always knew I was great, not it seems the world agrees as well.""  Those are just singers but you'll find that with others as well. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg all had this drive to be the best. It's okay to be driven by success.  Here's where it needs to change: You need to fail gracefully. You need to realize there's not a moment where it just clicks, eureka; and then you're successful. It's a continuous spectrum of ups and downs. Remember he failed 1000 times before Edison made his lightbulb. Its okay to fail, because you're always going to be moving forward. It doesn't matter at the end of your life if you had more failures then victories. You'll have been successful by the fact that you made it.  Another thing is that you're not better than people measured in success. Poor people are not worse than you and rich ones are not better. You're just a member of society whose goal in life is to be successful. Some people just want to go home and drink a beer. Others live to fish and hunt. Others to produce art without caring whether they have acclaim. All these people have an equal worth no matter their goals.   Dreamers go far and learn to see this desire positively. Let this be the north on your compass. But there's no reason for you not to go off into the woods and explore. You'll always have your compass to guide you back."

Have you improved in any way? That way the competition stays the same, instead of always adding new ""opponents"" with very different starting conditions. Failure is a way to learn and improve. There wasn't ever anyone who never failed. Really successful people overcome failure well.  Standard cliché answer, but it does help."

DecidingToBeBetter,35qwmv,MauPow,66,Tue May 12 19:44:11 2015 UTC,"Part of the human condition is dealing with a mental concept of self, you can call it ego. Bascially, you are identifying with this mental concept of self, whether it be a future projection or a projection on how others view you. You want to stand out from the crowd, become ""better"", but your ego is more concerned with the fear of failure, and the humiliation and ridicule it can come with. So the desire to ""enhance"" oneself is overrided by the fear of failure.   By just being aware of this mental concept of self, you dissolve it, and transcend mind indentification. You put a space between you (the observer, your true self) and the stream of thoughts/images/emotions/sensations that pass through your consciousness. When you (the observer, the awareness) identify with those thoughts/images/emotions/sensations, you form a mental concept of self, an ego. The nature of the ego is that ii feels incomplete. Its always searching for fufillment and it looks to the world of form (validation/approval, materialism, ideology/belief systems) to complete itself. However, all forms are fleeting and unstable. Feelings of satisfaction quickly dissapate and you are left again with emptiness. The ego can never be satisfied, it always wants more, it is its nature.  If you observe and become aware of your own ego, then you won't governed by it any longer and you will drop thinking and enter the present moment. When you are fully in the present moment you simply just do things, there is no thinking involved. Its like you're on autopilot, everything is flowing, and you take right action without having to analyze the situation.  Many people, myself included, find this incredibly difficult because we are so addicted to thinking that we don't even recognize it anymore. We end up identifying with that voice in your head, the one that tells you not to do something to avoid embarrassment. If you can recognize that voice as your ego, and not who you truly are, then you will experience an awakening, enlightenment, whatever you want to call it.  Also, this is incredibly difficult because we resist unpleastent feelings, usually escaping them with drugs, hobbies, thinking, etc. You can call it the pain-body, which is just painful emotions from your past. This is usually why we resist what is. We run from the present moment because a lot of the time we don't like ourselves in the now. That is why we reject what is, and project ourselves into the future. But, if you can learn to ACCEPT the present moment, even the difficult feelings of humiliation, ennui/emptiness, longing/lonliness, sadness/despair, anger/restlessness, anxiety/fear, physical discomfort/pain, and the pain of loss, then those feelings will eventually dissipate and be transmuted into positive energy and you will experience true joy. And it will come without validation, things/money, or another person, it will come from within, and you will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.   Read A New Earth by Eckart Tolle if you are interested in recognizing the nature and structure of the ego, he illustrated it beautifully. As well as the timeless widsom that has helped people transcend it."
DecidingToBeBetter,35qwmv,CrownChief,8,Tue May 12 21:07:10 2015 UTC,"Man, I'm going to have to do some more Tolle reading. I've read Power of Now and it really helped, I'll have to revisit it.

DecidingToBeBetter,35qwmv,TheCleansingFlame,5,Tue May 12 21:40:19 2015 UTC,"The power of Now is worth reading a few times. I always seem to find something I didn't understand or missed out while my mind was away. It's important to get that part right because you are getting the building blocks/fundamentals that will help you reconstruct your thought process, awareness and mindfulness. It also helps because some patterns played by the ego are actually quite intelligent. You won't even notice that you are associated with it while thinking you are aware.   What has helped me the most is to make audits as the observer of my mind. If you read the definition of what an audit is, it helps you be impartial and allows you to create a bigger gap between being and thinking."

I'll look into that audit part again, sounds interesting and I don't remember that part."

You could be embarrassed by your lack of knowledge and beat yourself up over it. ""How could I be proud of doing this? I should have already known how to do this!"" Or you could be scared of success because that means more responsibility, expectations, and attention. You might not trust yourself to make success sustainable so you think moving away where nobody knows you gives you a chance to rebuild trust in yourself with no eyes on you. There's a lot of potential reasons why."

This is it exactly. I don't trust myself to continue with my successes. I've been going to a therapist lately, which I'd never done before, and she made me realize that I never learned how to fail. I'm the typical breezed-through-school kid, but I never put any real effort into it. I was always decent to good, but I never trusted myself to make anything I ever did great. But when I do fail, I don't know how to deal with it except by withdrawing and not trying to make up for my mistakes.  Is it bad to want to run away? Should I?

If you lose weight, many people will congratulate you, but others, often close friends or family, will resent you for making changes they wish they could do.

Of course I'm afraid of failing, isn't everyone? I'm fine with it, I've failed lots. The part I have trouble with is learning from the failure. Usually I let that little voice pervade my mind with thoughts like ""See, of course you failed, because that's what you are: a failure"", ""Yep, that sucked, I don't know why you even tried"", etc."
DecidingToBeBetter,35qwmv,Feelngroovy,6,Tue May 12 21:37:40 2015 UTC,"[Erm, sorry, this got longer than intended, and perhaps more blunt than it should be.  FWIW, this is meant entirely in the spirit of betterment.]  After reading through your other responses... I kinda get it -- feeling like you've got no motivation and no self discipline, not mentioning even trivial goals because you feel like you'll just fail again, etc.  So I'm going to be blunt, because I think I understand what you're dealing with, and I think you can hear it.  You know you aren't that happy with how things are now.  You wouldn't have posted what you did if you were.  You want things to change, but you're afraid to make them change.   Of course I'm afraid of failing, isn't everyone?    No.  And that's part of the problem.  You've very likely tied your identity to your smarts, and when you fail, you feel it as a personal affront to your worth as a human being.  When you fail, you don't say, ""damn, that sucked,"" get back up, and try again.  Instead, when you fail, you say, ""damn, I suck,"" and you take it as a sign that you should never try that again.  Quite frankly, that's bullshit.  Yes, failure can be uncomfortable, but there's a difference between being discomfited by something and being so afraid and embarrassed about something that you shoot yourself in the foot.  So, what to do about it?  Hell if I know how to fix it (... this may simply be me projecting my own issues on you! :) ) , but for what it's worth, here's some things I've found helpful:  Repeatedly do something, and celebrate when you do it.  The task isn't important -- the action and celebration pairing is.  Pick something trivial and do it on a regular schedule (e.g., every day).  And every time you do it, celebrate immediately in some small way.  Even if it's just a fist in the air in the shower because you remembered to freakin' shampoo your hair.  The task itself doesn't have to matter; the idea is to build a positive feedback loop in your own mind that you can do something you choose to do, instead of being a slave to your feelings.  In the same vein, also consider doing something like the X Effect.  Pick something easy that needs to be done, write it down, and mark it up.  Give yourself visual cues of your success -- and your failure.  And here's the important part:  When you fail -- and you probably will -- make yourself mentally get back up and try again.  Start small.  Don't tell anyone.  Do something -- it really doesn't even matter what it is at first, just choose to do something, and follow through with that choice."

Alison Armstrong is awesome at relationship stuff, and studying the differences between women and men. She has some videos on youtube. One book that has helped me recently is called Compelled to Control. I have issues with admitting I'm at fault which is largely do to my shame.. I don't want anyone to think I'm not good enough, smart enough, etc, I just want to fix THEM. It's been a tough read. I also had a crazy volatile relationship that I got out of last fall. It was like him and I just really brought out the deepest shadow shittiness in each other. Which was awful in the middle of it but a really awesome chance for self evaluation. As far as therapist.. I went to see one and didn't have much luck, but later on found a more life coach/spiritual guidance type person who helped out a lot.

But, to me, it seems like you need to learn how to say NO. If something doesn't feel right to do then DON'T do it. You are a grown man now and you can decide for yourself.   Elliott Hulse made some cool videos on the topic:   https://youtu.be/OPVWU6oSPZg https://youtu.be/K64Oz83swmA   This is something you MUST deal with. If you do not do it now, you will be tossed around for the rest of your life! It will prolly create some not-so-enjoyable confrontations but in the end your family will respect your point of view because they love you. GL&HF buddy :))))"

I know I just need enough energy to be able to be strong enough that what they say won't phase me. I spent 1 year living with them after I had to come back to San Francisco. I'm now living on my own and yesterday was just a special occasion. Also, saying no in Chinese is considered a formality. You're suppose to say no, but not mean no. I don't know how to communicate that when I say no, I mean no. I tired joking like ""man, I'm getting so fat"", but they respond with ""oh you're fine, don't waste it"". I don't get along well with the traditional Chinese culture.  I'll give the links a review though. They seem helpful to get my mind in the right state. Thank you kind stranger."
DecidingToBeBetter,35loj6,FinnianWhitefir,2,Mon May 11 16:25:40 2015 UTC,"""I'm just going to spend more time away from them""  Sounds like a good solution.  ""I've told my mom the level of anxiety it causes""  Sounds like a good source of drama.  To explain, I've grown convinced that the majority of this anxiety is learned.  We learn as kids to be worried, we learn that when we speak our mind or say 'no' that we'll be attacked, we learn that sharing our true selves in a social situation is dangerous and risky.  And as kids, we mostly learn this from our parents.  So I try to help people out on /r/SocialAnxiety by explaining that any progress or change in yourself really needs to be completely separate from your family/parents.  Don't explain to them, don't try to get them to change, don't try to include them in any progress you are trying to get.  A lot of intense therapy helped me get better and able to handle stuff like refusing demands by my family and saying no if I didn't want to do stuff.  You learn a lot of skills about how to interact in a safe and secure manner, and then can use those skills in more 'risky' interactions."

DecidingToBeBetter,35m7zy,WoahhhManRelax,2,Mon May 11 19:01:50 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have an attitude problem.   I'm not trying to be judgmental, because I have that too. I'm naturally lazy. I used to be quite overweight and to this day I struggle to maintain a proactive mindset. I have a tendency of putting forth just enough  effort in everything I do in order to get by. I'll wait until the very last minute to do things, and I'll stop working on personal projects when they're just good enough instead of great.   This is something that you need to work on every single day. Anything less and nothing will change. When you hear that little voice in the back of your head pipe up and start convincing you that you don't really need to do that right now, or that something doesn't really matter, shut that bitch up and go do that thing.  It's not just with exercise, this is a mentality that you can apply to literally everything you do. It could be the laundry, could be making a nice dinner, could be going out on a Friday night when you'd rather stay in. You just need to get in the habit of actually doing things instead of not doing them.   You're probably wondering how this will help you choose a major. I don't know you, but I'd wager a guess that you don't know what you want to do because you haven't really tried to do very many things. You haven't experienced anything that's really engrossed you to the point of wanting to do it for the rest of your life. So look harder. It doesn't sound like you've been looking at all, and you used the time away from college as an excuse to be lazy. You'll get nowhere doing that.   Look, at the end of the day nobody can help you but you. Coming to Reddit begging for answers will give you the sense that you're at least making some kind of effort to improve yourself, but you have to understand that it isn't good enough. You need to get to the heart of the problem, rip it out and replace it with something that will benefit you. In other words, you need a work ethic transplant.   You can start this literally right now by getting off your ass and doing something that you need to do. You know there's something. And don't stop. Quell that lazy voice. Go take a class in something you know nothing about. Go out and meet people. I don't care if you're awkward. Power through.   It's up to you mate. I can't help you. Reddit can't help you. Only you can help you. So stop making excuses and start.   Best of luck"

I've been stuck in this funk of wanting to get shit done and being too damn lazy to get it done for a year or so. I'm lazy as crap and I eat crappy food and feel addicted. I just don't know how to get out of it, it sucks. I haven't really ""exercised"" in I couldn't tell you how long."
DecidingToBeBetter,35m7zy,CircaSurvivor55,2,Mon May 11 22:56:09 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer:  This is in no way meant to sounds 'dick-ish' or judgmental or anything like that, I just was in a similar place a few years ago when I was in school, and found myself in a similar situation at the start of this year for some time. Just a harsh truth that I need a reminder of now and then...  So I've suffered from anxiety and depression since about the 3rd grade. It can be debilitating at times, mix in a natural laziness as well and I tend to let it hold me back quite a bit.  Anyways, I noticed something in this last comment of yours that I have a recurring problem with - I allow myself to perform below my potential, and in all aspects of my life. In relationships, in jobs, in how I even treat myself. I know what I'm capable of accomplishing, but I will give up at the first sign of adversity or difficulty, or really, anything that I need to actually work for. I've abandoned a lot of things I've set out to accomplish just barely after starting, and then later feel depressed or angry or whatever when I'm not where I want to be.  The problem I struggle with is accountability. I'll chock it up to the anxiety or depression, or that I wasn't given what I needed to accomplish my goals, etc etc etc. I was okay with that for a long time, and constantly copped out of accepting responsibility and blaming other people or circumstances on the outcome of where I was at that time.  This is where you come in - 'I just need some tools to do better.' I understand what you mean. What you want to accomplish with your life to be better goes against everything your natural instincts have always told you to do or is acceptable, and you feel like you need tools or help in order to do that.  '...I eat crappy food and feel addicted.' again, another cop out. You don't want to eat like crap anymore and you want to lose weight or whatever, but this addiction is holding you back.  Before you can move forward and start on the road to being the person you want to be, you need to take a harsh look at yourself and take accountability for where you are right now. This can be pretty tough and I don't mean to make it sounds like I'm saying 'just do it', and it certainly doesn't happen overnight (it's also something you need to continually work on or else you'll tend to 'relapse' and start blaming other things for your situation again).  Thinking you need those tools to be a better is really whats holding you back - saying that you just need some tools in order to be better better relieves you of the burden, and places the responsibility elsewhere. Same with the idea of addiction. It's okay to admit that you just really like eating crappy food. I love crappy food. Haha. One of my favorite past times is finding a good movie and sitting down with a ton of crappy food and just binge eating. But if it's not inline with your overall goal of weight loss or being healthier, then you need to own it.  It's really not all bad though - where this harsh realization originates is also where you can find the best motivation to keep going, and stick on that road of becoming a better you. When you own the negative outcomes of your actions, you also see that you own the positive outcomes. You can always fall back on knowing that with a little perspective, or a kick in the ass, your goals really aren't out of reach. The way I look at it, is not to make it into this mountain of a task that you need to overcome to get to your goal.  One kind of stupid idea that makes it easy for me is this - think about life like the old school super mario games, regardless of what you do, life will always be moving in the same direction. It doesn't matter how much you kick or scream, it's just the inevitability of our reality. You can't go back and choose to go a different route, or start over from the beginning, and you need to accept that. But that's okay. Its behind you now. What you can do is choose to take a step in the direction you want to go, and let the momentum of good decisions help take it from there.  If you find yourself driving in the opposite direction of where you want to go, do you keep going in that direction hoping you'll just end up where you wanted to be? Of course not. Well it's similar to your life... turn that bitch around and start heading in the direction you WANT to be going, but enjoy the ride. You will need to work for it, and you will face some difficulty, and it won't be easy.... but it isn't impossible either. But setting yourself up for success and just enjoying the ride is how you not only get to your goal, but it's how you find what you really love in life.  I apologize for the ridiculously long rant, but I'm also kind of reminding myself about all of this. I also didn't mean to sound preachy or like I've got it all figured out. I don't. I just know that putting things into perspective and getting out of my own way is always the first step that I need to take, or else I just end up in the wrong direction again.  Regardless - good luck, and remember that you only just turned 21. A year from now you're going to be a completely different person, and a year after that, you'll be someone else. Enjoy this time while you can, and just keep working on taking small steps in the right direction!"
DecidingToBeBetter,35m7zy,Goldie2000,2,Tue May 12 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"So one constant theme I see in subs like this one (/r/selfimprovementis another) is the theme that people think they are lazy.  They are caught up in a circle of self-doubt and low-confidence due to the simple fact that they have so much choice.  You have a plethora of choices in front of you.  Not only do you have so many to choose from, but making the wrong one can seem absolutely terrifying.  So we don't make one at all.  We make excuses:  I'm lazy.  I have no money.  I have no discipline.  I have no ideas, etc.    The reality is this:  self improvement takes work.  It's going to take introspection.  Possibly meditation.  Some journaling.  Digging deep to figure out what you want to do.  And then taking that humongous step to actually do it.  And keep doing it.  Eye on the prize.  It takes discipline and hard work.  In the end, it's worth it but it sure as heck isn't easy.  At least not at first.  It's like a muscle - you'll build it over time.  Of course, there is the option of joining the military.  If you let them, they'll teach you discipline.  They're darn good at it.  They break you down and build you back up and along the way you'll gain confidence and discipline which can carry over for some into civilian life.  Heck you could even make a career out of it.  Either way, you need to make some choices.  They aren't easy, but once you do make them, you will have your direction.  Best of luck to you."

DecidingToBeBetter,35iawi,lifedreams,36,Sun May 10 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"I am a huge fan of stoicism but I don't really like the tone of this video. One hour listening to your friend bitch about work is an hour you get to console someone for work sucking, or you get to be there for someone in need (though maybe not DIRE need). I think the takeaway is hidden deep down which is that if you valued your time a LITTLE bit better, you'd find that there is enough of it to do the things that you love to do. But surely I can't shirk the responsibilities of sending out an envelope or working a 9-5 job (I mean you CAN technically but that would be selfish to someone depending on the income or the envelope arriving), there are just some things that maybe you don't want to do, but you have to. I have to work to support my family and the stoics, especially Marcus Aurelius, talked a lot about upholding their responsibilities even in the face of personal and emotional adversity. Marcus Aurelius never really wanted to be emperor but he know things would turn to shit if he wasn't watching over humanity.  Life is NOT short and you certainly shouldn't waste a second of it, but this video takes that idea and sort of runs away with it."

DecidingToBeBetter,35iawi,OriginalName75,2,Mon May 11 05:08:11 2015 UTC,"The idea of budgeting time wisely is somewhere in this mess of a video.  Something tells me this 22 year old hasn't settled into a job, nor has he gotten married. (Or have had children)  Sure if I didn't have to work 8 hours a day I'd have plenty of time to do as I please.  Never disagree with your spouse? Never listen to a friend in their time of need? Don't watch television or drink?  Shall I become Amish while I'm at it?  Humans sacrifice what time they do have- to make their budgeted free time more enjoyable.  Not everyone can be a free spirited wanderer.  Life seems too short to the 69 year old man because, frankly, it is.  Most 69 year olds I know still don't know ""what it is they want to do with their life"".  We humans all die young in spirit. You have to try your best to get paid to do something you don't hate.  If that's being a full time janitor-wonderful...take pride in your work.  If you hate it, try to move to something else more fulfilling.  We can't all be astronauts and physicist- but if we're wishing away Monday through Friday...that's a significant portion of life wished away. 69 years of Saturdays and Sundays only certainly feels short.  Some people are lucky or talented enough to find that perfect balance,  where work is at the very least tolerable or rewarding.  Some may never find this.  It's a bit condescending to assume they don't know how, or don't want to, and need a 22 year old scholar to show them the error of their ways.  Perhaps it's just because they realize (consciously or not) that on a cosmic scale- it doesn't matter if they find happiness.  Sometimes life's circumstances are not conducive to being happy.  Most people who ""complain"" about life being too short aren't ""wasting their time"" (those silly 69 year old fools, if they'd only watched this short video) , rather they have genuine despair that they don't have more time for happiness, and fulfillment, because those things don't come so easily to everyone."

I worked at Geek Squad for about 6 months before someone I knew was willing to put in a good word for me at my current company.  It's possible, but you need to start networking with people. IT is such a vast field and people are always looking for computer help. Talk to people, let them know you are good with computers, and help them out (be careful about working for free though... you want to avoid calls from people you helped 6 months ago looking for a favor).  Once you've helped out a few people, maybe a small business or two, you can start using them as references. Not having a college degree is definitely going to keep some doors shut, but it isn't the end of the world.   I personally would think about taking out some student loans and going to college though. Once you're in the industry you may realize that it isn't what you want to do for the rest of your life. I'm currently in the process of getting a computer science degree because I can't stand the IT culture for the rest of my life. Having no education past high school really limits my opportunities with moving companies/roles.   Getting A+ certified is a great step forward if you want to go the no college route, but you'll need to get more certs than you'd think to compete for the high paying IT jobs. If you're dead set against college you should look into Red Hat certifications as well (they can pay really well if you like being a Linux admin).

After as little as a year as a desktop technician you can move into something that is part desktop technician, part systems administrator, but having just that 1 year as a desktop technician will open a lot of doors in this field. I went to work for a medical practice after LESS than a year as a desktop technician. This job pays better and comes with less BS but different BS.  After about a year or two doing that, you should have a good idea where you would like to go next. Certifications aren't really necessary unless the titles you hold require them, and you can often convince them to pay for the certs.  The college degree isn't really necessary in this field. Work experience is needed though. IT guys like to change teams every few years to get a significant pay raise unless they are happy with the freedom of their current jobs. Build a /r/homelab to play around with network administration. Learn to cable things pretty."
DecidingToBeBetter,35jh0v,Pokiarchy,2,Mon May 11 14:35:38 2015 UTC,"The problem is that any bigger company with decent salaries, benefit and maybe interesting projects is bound to their strictl defined processes. Which means they often are unable to higher  you even if they want to because you don't match the company's defined criteria.  There is a reason why people say that they solely go to college for the paper.  You still can find a job but many companies you would like to work for wouldn't be able to hire you you also can't participate in some trainings  that require you to have a relevant degree. So getting a promotion  is harder to justify so will just get stuck."
DecidingToBeBetter,35jh0v,Shizo211,3,Mon May 11 08:14:25 2015 UTC,This is not always true and it gets less true every day. I got hired by the r&d arm of a large company that I've always respected. I make a fair amount with great benefits. they had specifically changed the job description to not require a college degree because they weren't able to find a good candidate until they got rid of it. I imagine many more companies are realizing this.
DecidingToBeBetter,35jh0v,fewdea,2,Mon May 11 11:34:15 2015 UTC,"It surely depends from company to company, yet, certificates are always good except if  you are specialized in a very niche type of thing and they are desperate to fill that position then you might get lucky, but then your job chances probably aren't that good to begin with.  If you do something that is not so niche then you have plenty of competitors with an actual guarantee and a validation of their set of skills.   they had specifically changed the job description to not require a college degree because they weren't able to find a good candidate until they got rid of it.   This is the main issue. By default it requires the degree and only if they can't find someone they consider rewriting the job description (if they do anything about it at all) but that basically hopes for the premise that you don't have any qualified competitors when applying for the job.  Also a college/university degree suggests the development of certain social/soft skills that aren't guaranteed from someone who spend most of his time at home.   If a company has two candidates with the same qualifications the nit's a non-brainer to hire the one with the certificates because if the employee messes up then it's easier to justify an employee with certificates than one without one. It should be obvious that the responsible person can get in trouble for hiring someone without certificates for hiring someone with apparently no qualification. This can also cause compliance and ethical issues. Talking from the experience from the big corporation I currently work with."
DecidingToBeBetter,35jh0v,Shizo211,2,Mon May 11 11:49:59 2015 UTC,"That piece of paper is important. It reduces the risk in hiring you. I'm guessing you're in the US, because of your concern about college costs. Is there a community college near you, where you can take classes part time? All the community colleges near me offer IT Associates degrees. That will make a difference. Tuition plus fees are $181.00/credit, and there are opportunities for financial aid.  While you're studying, keep applying for IT jobs. I've always looked very favorably on people who've shown the motivation to put themselves through a degree while working."
DecidingToBeBetter,35jh0v,baddspellar,2,Mon May 11 10:24:24 2015 UTC,"It is possible, but you'll lose out to people with degrees for years, until you gain YEARS of experience and have a good resume.   It also depends where you live. If you live in an area with low demand college is a must.  It will also take years of study to get to the point where you'll be hireable too.   Computers are one degree where, as long as you go to a reasonably priced school, you will be able to pay off your debt and will make considerably more money if you do."

If you can try to get on with some company that offers tech service (like Best Buy's Geek Squad) then they might be more willing to take you under their wing than other companies. Also try to look into getting certifications, but make sure you get the ones that more relevant to what you want to do/the demand is. You don't want to spend a lot on certifications that you may not utilize.  Not having a college degree makes it more difficult, but if you keep searching and trying something is bound to come up. The important part is to keep moving forward. This means you keep applying to places, you keep seeking out opportunities, and you don't work for free unless the connections you'd get outweigh the cost of your labor. That's different for everyone, but it's something that everyone seeking a job should keep in mind."

At the moment I do alot of free or cheap things so I can save to go travelling.  But I sometimes splash out and go to a gig and see some new bands.    Do whatever you want.  Enjoy being alone,  enjoy making new friends.  Try everything,  if you don't like it,  don't do it again.  But at least you tried.   There are so many things to do in life I think that it stops people doing something as they can't pick.  So just pick at random and go from there.  Let friends pick for you.  Enjoy you free time!!!

The key to making good use of your free time is to do something that progresses you to any one of your goals, whether it be learning how to program through Codecademy, finishing an art project, biking a certain distance, or even beating a video game on the hardest mode.  One thing that I've come across this past year is The Impossible List. The Impossible List is like a bucket list on steroids. It's a tiered list of goals that helps you be productive and keep being productive in your life. Use it to devote your free time to any one of your goals, even if it seems like a small one. That way, you're progressing towards something and not just letting your time waste away.  That said, it's okay to relax once in while! I find that playing Skyrim, watching my favorite TV show, or browsing reddit are all things I do when I need some time to recompose myself."

Wake up, brew a nice cup of coffee and sit somewhere with a view for a while. This peace will have a lasting effect on your day and mood. Read books Go outside Fix that thing you've been meaning to get to (keeping a list is good for this) Go for a walk in the woods! Go for a bike ride Teach yourself to longboard. This is actually pretty easy once you get the very basics down. Get some plants and take care of them. I personally like to get stuff like herbs or aloe, which I can then use! Give an area of your place a deep clean (kitchen, bathroom, whatever). Take everything off the counters, give it a good spray down. Clean your sink, your toilet and your shower. It's AMAZING how great a clean bathroom feels. Make a little craft, like a painting. Don't take it too seriously. Watch classic movies that you've been meaning to get around to. Culture yourself.

Then I read a nugget of wisdom: stress isn't a result of having lots to do (that never changes), stress is a result of uncertainty.  In most most (but not all) circumstances, if you map out the very next step to solve a problem you'll find you head will begin to clear, and the stress will go away.  And I mean the very next small step:  make the call, send the email, walk to the drug store, sketch the outline, etc.   Determining your very next action on all of your open-loops can take some time (the first time around).  Block out a couple of uninterruptable hours and write down whats stressing you out.  Then for each item, decide on what you can do, as the very next step, to move things forward.  This exercise alone will make you feel much better, probably not perfect, but you'll be in a much better head-space, I promise.  Good luck!"

It's super helpful, and can vastly reduce your stress about a situation.   One thing that you have which is incredibly valuable is an end goal. You ""really want to make sure she can live comfortably for the remainder of her life."" That is a fuckin' awesome goal.   With that in hand, you can break down various specific things that will get you to that goal. What exactly does 'comfortably' mean to you? Does it mean the same thing to her? Have you asked? When I say specific here, I mean something measurable - ""$50K in savings"", or ""own a house without a mortgage"", or ""allowance of $X per year from me"".   Once you've figured out what specific  financial goal you're working towards in the long term, you have a guiding star. You can navigate through your life considering your decisions in relation to that guide. ""Does this decision get me closer to GOAL?"" is a question you'll have to get used to asking. In the long term, make this question a habit. In the short term, give yourself some reminder of it. I used to write my question on the back of my hand every morning.   Once you've got the goal and the question, you can look for next steps.   You've got a sense of where in Europe would be inexpensive for the both of you. One good next step would be to, BEFORE YOUR DEGREE IS OVER, reach out to people in your field in those areas. Try to cold-contact them. In this day and age, most people who are tied to a profession are in some professional network or have an email address publicly available. There are good guides to cold contacting on the internet, so I won't go into specifics here.   Other next steps might be working on your resume, or going to a career counseling service at your university.   Try to take one step towards your goal every day. The knowledge that you are getting closer to your goal is the best stress reduction technique I've ever found.   You have a good goal, and you have time to get there.   Good Luck."

So when you sit down you say ""OK I only have ten minutes to read this chapter"" and then you set a timer. Ten minutes is up and you decide ""read more of the chapter or browse reddit"". Maybe you will decide to go for Reddit. Set the timer and when 10 minutes are up you can say ""OK well I don't need to waste more time here, what can I do in the next ten minutes.."" and set the timer.

I taught a 39 year old to drive and here's what I learned:   Most people learn how to drive at 16ish when you don't have any real understanding of consequence and haven't lost anyone to the road yet. You're learning as an adult. Keep your head in check and you'll be fine.  Trust no one. Treat every single car as thought the driver is about to fuck up. This doesn't mean freak out and dodge everything but you should definitely be watching everyone and never trust an indicator. Don't mistake knowing how to operate the car for knowing how to drive. Once you can drive the car, you then have to learn how to negotiate the roads and all of the hazards associated. As /u/EstherHarshom mentioned, you really do keep learning once you get your license.  Until you've been in an accident, you can't appreciate how quickly it happens. Don't use your phone, don't speed, don't drink drive.

A gun should be treated with respect but a car can possibly do more damage much easier and so you should drive with that level of awareness.

Do not live your life in fear. Bad things happen. Good things happen. That which you cannot control (Examples: wreckless drivers, bad weather) should not dictate your life. Some things are just unavoidable. Focus on what you can control. You can be focused. You can be vigilant. You can be aware. You can anticipate. You can practice. You can be positive. There is a freedom that comes from driving. It is very convenient. You can go where you want to go, when you want to go. Modern society requires some sort of transportation to actually survive. I believe you want to learn how to drive because the hassle is becoming to great to avoid learning. If you are not comfortable...don't. However, note that fear is self inflicted. Fear is your subconscious mind telling you that you are at the border of your comfort zone. You can only grow when you push past the fear and take action. Driving is a privilege. It is your choice if you want to. Don't feel forced. Live your life the way you see fit. If you can do without driving and live a happy life, by all means remain happy. Remember that everyone is human and makes mistakes. Some mistakes in driving cause accidents, but you can do your best to avoid those mistakes. Be brave. Do your best. Be yourself. Best of luck to you in whatever you decide my friend."

Don't let honky Mcgee get go you. 2) Spend some time in a parking lot getting used to the car.  Have fun, not crazy un-safe fun, but like how fast can you stop? Go? Turn left and right etc. Get a feel for the car. 3) Always pay attention to what is going on around you. This includes  knowing where you are going, watching the road and other drivers, watching for pedestrians, reading and obeying traffic signs. 4) Don't be doing anything else other than driving.  No cell phone, even just leave the radio alone. 5) Keep 1 or 2 car lengths between you and the person in front of you always. 6) Use your signals to let others know where you want to go or are going.  Hmm that's all I can think of for now!  Wear your seat belt and make sure you have insurance!  Otherwise just be safe!"

He always felt rushed by people behind him. People in cars behind you don't matter (unless they're trying to overtake you while you're trying to change lanes or something). If you don't think there's a big enough gap for you to get into then don't go, it doesn't matter if there's 40 cars lined up behind you waiting, you wait until YOU think it's safe. Let those fuckers honk all day if they want. When I was learning to drive I stalled the car about a dozen times on the one roundabout (it was slightly uphill and after the first two times I was flustered). The people behind me just had to wait.  When you first get into the car take as long as you like to get settle, find all the switched and levers, adjust your chair, adjust your mirrors etc. Take half an hour if you want. It's your time."

I made small but stupid mistakes (not coming to a full stop at a stop sign, for instance) but finally got it right.   Learn to shoulder check, and always check before doing a lane change. Keep a decent-sized buffer between you and the car in front, and take your foot off the accelerator and prepare to slow down or stop the moment you see the lead car's brake lights come on.  Also be aware of whether a green light ahead is ""stale"" (i.e., if the ""Don't Walk"" signs are already flashing) so that you don't have to panic-stop to avoid running a red light. In bad weather, triple the stopping distance."

Age is not a big problem. The important thing is not to panic and be alert. The more relaxed you are the more able you are to notice hazards and react. It is difficult if you have an impatient instructor who's always yelling in your ear. Your instructor makes a big difference so pick wisely. There is a huge difference when I'm relaxed and driving and when I'm tense and harried. Its literally as if two different people are driving. Just relax completely and if anything goes wrong, just brake. The brake is always there when you need it."

I waited until I was 18-19 to learn to drive due to similar problems/anxieties with parents not around to teach me and seeing people get hurt, so you are definitely not alone. The best advice I got while learning is to not let other drivers intimidate you, just go at your own pace but make sure you're being safe and aware of all your surroundings at all times. Even if you're being careful you gotta keep an eye out for the people who aren't. And no texting and driving, but I'm sure you're smarter than that ;) I always just throw my phone in the backseat so I'm not even tempted!"

But in the end, the games of life and death trapped them and they were back to the daily grind. I feel like that's what gets us you know?

And even with that you don't have to jump right into boot camp, start with running for a week for example, drink more water. The next week maybe some sit ups and more vegetables, etc. Take a few months to just focus on that and once you're in a comfortable routine, go to the next on the list.  If you try to change everything all at once you'll be completely overwhelmed, and the chances of sustaining those changes is pretty low. It takes time, a lot of time, but every small step you take makes the next one that much easier."
DecidingToBeBetter,35bbxr,Drillsgtsandwich,5,Sat May 9 05:35:03 2015 UTC,"Ok. Let's address these points, and the attitude behind them. About me: I had no education past the third grade. None. I was scrawny, weak, afraid, and alone. Now I'm fit, I have a great social circle and an amazing marriage, I have a great technical job, and I'm a drill sergeant in the reserves. I'm literally trained and experienced in taking scared kids and transforming them into Soldiers. I use my personal experience and training to do that. You want to transform yourself. Here's my advice.  Step one: Cancel the pity party. Beating yourself up and bemoaning your situation is making excuses. You've decided you want to improve yourself and your situation. That's great! Too many people sit around and wait for their lives to suddenly fall into place. Nobody ever got better by blaming the world around them.  As far as wasted time goes, there's a saying: ""The best time to start is 10 years ago. The second best time is now."" The past is the past, and you needed to go through it to reach this point. Consider it the tuition you needed to pay to learn an important lesson.  This seems huge and overwhelming, but it's not. One thing you're noticing a bit is that these things are interrelated. Improving one portion can improve other portions, or make them easier to tackle.  The first thing you need to do is figure out where you are, and where you want to be. Not in a ""I suck, and I want to suck less"" way, but in an objective manner. Let's address your goals in that light.   Career - What would it take to get back to school? Choosing schools to apply to, filling out applications, having somebody proofread your essays, having transcripts sent, etc. Figure out what steps you would need to do to get back into school. Would you work and go to school at the same time, apply for scholarships, or take out loans? Is school the only option you can take to have a better career? What else could you do? Finance - What debts do you have? How much do you make, and how much can you put aside to pay down your debt? Look into the ""debt snowball"" or ""debt avalanche"" method. How will your finances be affected by going back to school? Personal growth - Getting rid of your anxiety is a useless goal. Sorry to tell you, but nobody gets rid of all of their anxiety. But you can learn to deal with it, and make it less of an influence on your life. This takes time, and a lot of hard work. Some things to consider: Therapy/medication, progressive exposure (do things that make you anxious bit by bit, and expand your boundaries,) personal introspection (why are you anxious? What makes you most anxious? What thought patterns hold you back?) One powerful phrase I've used is ""Who said being anxious about something meant I didn't have to do it?"" When some young private at the top of our rappel tower tells me they're scared, my response is ""so what? I'm not telling you not to be scared. I'm telling you to get off of my tower."" Health - This is the easiest one. First things first, make a plan to start cultivating a habit of health. For instance, what would ""eat healthier"" mean? What sorts of meals would you want to eat? What would that grocery list look like? And for exercise, the important thing is to do something instead of nothing. Even just starting out with 1-3 scheduled days a week is better than nothing. When would you do that? Make a schedule. Look at your sleep habits, your diet, and your current state of physical fitness. Start small. Try the C25K program. Having a set schedule and milestones will help. Family - You don't have control over them, but you have control over yourself. What parts of these relationships are you responsible for? How could you be better at that, regardless of their actions or response? Therapy might be helpful here too. Relationship - Again, what's your role in this? Would you want to be in a relationship with yourself right now? Why or why not? What could you do to be a better person in a relationship? Again, look into professional therapy to help you address these. Social life - Friendship isn't something you ""get."" Being a good friend and interesting person leads to friendships. Look at the sorts of people that you would want to be friends with. What sort of traits and characteristics do they have? How could you cultivate those traits? Literally every skill that exists can be improved and practiced. When you work on those, the friends will be a side effect. Choose friends that support and encourage who you want to be. Attitude - No. Getting a better job or friends won't change your attitude. Changing your attitude will lead to an improvement in yourself, which can lead to things like a better job or attract more friends. Wanting your situation to change your attitude is asking the world to be responsible for what you control. Your happiness isn't going to automatically improve if you get a different job, or a relationship. You need to learn to focus on what you can control internally.   What you need is a fundamental shift in how you're looking at things. You have a lot going for you, more than some people that have made more of what they have then you have. And it wasn't because of their situation. Their attitude showed through in their results. And their work and effort paid off. Every single day, you have an opportunity to improve yourself and your life. Take it.  If you want, send me a PM, and I'll help you look at your situation and come up with some action steps you can take to develop your habits and attitude. Not some magic pill or process you take to suddenly have an awesome life, but changing how you address life to start a continuous path."
DecidingToBeBetter,35bbxr,_playitagain__,2,Sat May 9 22:02:27 2015 UTC,I think you should start with your attitude. Start by being positive and changing the way you think about things and then start making other changes. You got this!!

Throwing yourself into one may be a good idea. Particularly if its a physical one.   Personally I found martial arts was a good outlet in terms of meeting new people/ punching the crap out of some pads to rid pent-up emotions and a general all-round improvement in self-confidence.   Mindfulness is also a very under-rated tool (is it still under-rated?) to govern your emotions and to learn that you are in control of them. Shit loads of information can be found online. It can help you stop over-thinking things and making yourself depressed by realising when you are going down a negative thought spiral.   Also, you say that you think a lot of your issues stem from having no long-term goal but you also say that you wish to become a particle physicist. Well then that's your long term goal!

''If your ego starts out, 'I am important, I am big, I am special,' you're in for some disappointments when you look around at what we've discovered about the universe. No, you're not big. No, you're not. You're small in time and in space. And you have this frail vessel called the human body that's limited on Earth.''  Think about all the people in history who felt this way, and consider the amount of time and effort that they spent expressing this to the people around them whether consciously or subconsciously. With few exceptions, all of them are largely forgotten by history.   Perhaps a question to ask is if your are living life by your own values, or are you living a life based on ideas that people around you value.

DecidingToBeBetter,358skx,FeloniousMonk94,8,Fri May 8 05:12:31 2015 UTC,"One idea is that of the fixed vs growth mindset.  In the first, you were told you were smart/pretty/socially adept as a kid, and you're trying to preserve that by never looking like a fool.  You'll avoid challenges because they're threatening to your status, which could be lost or severely compromised by just one embarassing event.  You think of your worth as something you have innately, but can only lose and not gain any more of.  In contrast, there's the growth mindset, where you focus on the effort you make, and reflect on how to get better at things and be a better person.  A lot of ""threats"" are seen for what they are: opportunities to develop as a person.  To be honest, the stuff you wrote sounds narcissistic.  (not in the common sense, but in the psychological one).  The upside is that you have the introspective ability to see that things aren't perfectly fine with the person you are right now, and clinical narcissists do not have such insight into their personality.  It is your self-honesty in evaluating your character that allows you to grow- without it, you'd be fucked, like clinical narcissists are.  There's a philosopher called Derek Parfit.  In ""reasons and persons"", he outlines his view of personal identity- what makes you you, over time and space.  His view is that it is psychological continuity that makes you you, and that at a future date, the you that you will be then can be very different from the you you are now, and that it is only the sequence of mental events, experiences and so on that connect these two persons that make them the same person.  That is to say, that there are probably strangers in the world that are closer to the future you than current you is to that future you (Parfit uses this to argue against egoist ethics, but that's another discussion).  It's your actions in the present that determine what sort of person you will end up being."

I've noticed personally that I don't really care much about other people (except for their opinions about me). When I'm nice to people it's often to seem nice and to ""do the right thing"" rather than legitimately caring about them. This is not overly a problem (I'm not THAT shitty of a person) but its another thing I've been trying to fix.  And the view on personal identity you talked about is very interesting. I read somewhere years ago that the self is constantly dying and being reborn and so there is not one continuous self but a new self for each new moment. (Might have been a buddhism thing?) That kind of resonated with me, and I think it fits into your point that future me will be different than present me, so that I should work for personal growth to make future me a better person.  This helped a lot, thanks."

And if they do, you shouldn't care if they do. Sometimes, people will break that rule. Spend your life with those people. I mean, spend you life with those who share your interests. You don't need to impress everyone. You will naturally impress those who care.  Also, I don't have a link or anything to back this up, but some studies show that admitting mistakes, showing embarrassment, and accepting loss around other people makes them trust and accept you. People don't like feeling inferior and they are less likely trust and accept you when they feel less threatened."

Not saying it is the case for you but it is possible that at some point you felt inferior to others and started to try to feel and become superior to hide your true feeling of seeming inferior.

I was really shy and didn't talk/interact with people much for fear of making a fool out of myself. It makes sense that this fear stayed with me when I developed this need to be superior. I've improved my self-esteem for the most part but there are some lingering insecurities that probably add to this superiority complex I have.  Thanks for the comment
DecidingToBeBetter,358skx,autowikibot,2,Fri May 8 21:25:14 2015 UTC,"You pay too much attention on how other people think about you, and that eventually become the way you evaluate yourself. When you put opinions of other people to be the center of your life, you will miss things you really need to care about.  It's not about how other people think about you, its about how YOU think about yourself.  I was just like you, I wanted to be envied by people surrounding me, but these kinds of thoughts did not bring me anywhere closer to my goal. Now I do things because I want to become better me, and praises from other people become the nice little icing on top of the cake."
DecidingToBeBetter,358skx,stuffedweasel,1 point,Fri May 8 06:08:07 2015 UTC,"like /u/kerbyderwood said, this is about you worrying about what others think of you. First point:   You are letting them have power over you because you are changing your actions (not taking risks) because you're worried about what they might think. That's going to seriously hamper your ability to get shit done. In 5 years, you don't want to be regretting all the things you didn't do because you were afraid of someone else critiquing you. Further, many people are going to doubt you anytime you do anything. It's easy to cast doubt on people, and some people like to bring everyone else down. See Crab Mentality. This is just a fact of life, but really, no one has the right to criticize you if you're taking action and doing things and they are just standing on the sidelines. It's like when people watching a basketball game on TV yell at the players and get angry at them for making the wrong decision. It's always easier for an observer to be critical, but they have no skin in the game, so their opinion really doesn't count for shit. Trust me, professional athletes don't give a shit about the opinion of the guy on the couch. Why should you? The only critic you should definitely listen to is yourself.  As a side note: If you get defensive every time you aren't the best at something, it's just going to make you look insecure. You have many qualities that make up your identity. Just because you lost at a card game doesn't mean you're a useless person. You should have the confidence to say, ""Yea I lost that card game, but I'm still awesome at plenty of other things, so I'm fine with losing this one.""  Second point:  I'm a software engineer. You're some kind of engineer. I have lots of engineer friends in different fields and work with a lot of engineers. I don't want to generalize, but a common theme with engineers (and people in related disciplines) is the desire to be the smartest person in the room. For most of your life you were probably the smartest person in the room, and liked it. It's a part of who you are. Now you're in college, where (all joking aside) there's a higher percentage of smart people around you. Add to that fact that you're in engineering classes, with an even higher percentage of smart nerds, and they are all used to being the smartest person in the room. Now you can have a serious identity crisis as you cope with the fact that you may no longer be the smartest person in the room, so you try not to show any weakness as you fight to stay established as one of these very smart people in the eyes of your peers. And let me tell you, it's easy to tell who suffers from this mindset, and they are terrible to work with. They are terrified of looking dumb. They are constantly trying to defend their opinion even when it's not right. They will criticize your opinions and look for holes in them and try to make you look stupid. They will put more energy into having people think they are smart, than they will in actually getting work done. Don't go down that path. This may or may not be what's going on, but I see it happen all the time. It's more the rule than the exception in our fields. And it'll screw you.  I'm telling you right now you will not always be the smartest person in the room, and you don't want to be. You want to find the smartest person in the room, and learn from them. Worrying about making mistakes and looking dumb can seriously hold you back. No one knows everything (not since Aristotle anyway), so if you don't know something, admit it, then go ask someone who knows about it.  Lastly: good job for recognizing this and admitting it as a problem and looking to fix it.  TL;DR - Everyone's going to doubt you, ignore it and do what you were going to do anyway. You won't always be the smartest person in the room, find out who is and learn from them."

The metaphor refers to a pot of crabs. Individually, the crabs could easily escape from the pot, but instead, they grab at each other in a useless ""king of the hill"" competition which prevents any from escaping and ensures their collective demise.   The analogy in human behavior is sometimes claimed to be that members of a group will attempt to ""pull down"" (negate or diminish the importance of) any member who achieves success beyond the others, out of envy, conspiracy or competitive feelings, although this is not the behavior being exhibited by the crabs which are simply trying to escape themselves, without any knowledge or understanding of the supposed ""success"" of their fellow creatures.

Go into it with a positive mindset, and keep that positivity throughout the trip - especially when things start getting weird. You will laugh a lot, and your empathy and understanding will expand.

Passion isn't something that magically is handed to you, you have to get kicked around a little by real life.  Instead of worrying about your job and money for a moment, let me ask you: have you gotten out of your comfort zone ever?  What's something scary you wouldn't see yourself doing? Backpacking in another country? Moving to another city? Joining a fetish club and meeting a kinky person? I'm serious, sometimes you have to force yourself back into the variety of life. You have to go out, try something new and FAIL MISERABLY AT IT. You have to injure yourself physically and/or emotionally, and piece yourself back together a few times. Real life experiences don't happen because you successfully climbed a mountain in the Alps, they happen because you spent a lot of time preparing, training and practicing for your summit attempt, and suddenly you have a bad accident, have to spend a season recovering, and during this time you meet a cute physical therapist and fall in love.

See, people don't race to great results; they creep toward them, day to day.  If in 20 years you're a VP at a tech company, earning decently in the 6 figures, able to afford to do pretty much whatever you want (within reason), wouldn't that be a decent life?  You need to remember what most peoples' lives are like in this world, living on a few dollars (or less) a day.  You also could consider going back to school--not fulltime, but a class a semester.  Study either something moving toward your dream, or toward a Bachelor's.  Or take a flier on other kinds of classes--improv, acting, piloting, scuba.  We have a ton of young people on reddit.  So what I'm about to say may not seem very valuable.  But as a friend told me once, if you can find a job you don't hate, and it lets you earn enough to do things you love when you're not at work, that's not so bad.  This is what life is for the vast majority of reasonably more successful westernized people.  It may contradict the sense of exceptionalism with which so many grow up, but it is reality.  And speaking from the other side (though it sounds like I had more challenges than you (which may have colored my views)), it's okay."

DecidingToBeBetter,3574zk,orwellsocietyguy,1 point,Fri May 8 08:45:39 2015 UTC,"So I feel like this all the time. Im 22 years old living at home, with an Associate's Degree in Business Economics. School was never my passion I had a hard time focusing and would often sit there day dreaming about nothing. I've worked a lot of odd jobs and have yet to find a calling for something greater than myself. I went thru a downward spiral where I didn't know who I was, what I wanted with my life and I never really came out of but I learned a few things. Just because you live at home with your parents is not a bad thing, I love my family and we are so fortunate to have a family surrounding us. Look up to them, talk to them, they have often given me a valuable insight of what it is like growing up. You are doing well for yourself, keep going to the gym and eating healthy that will go a long way.   .. But if there's anything I have learned it's that life truly is a marathon, when god made time he made plenty of it. You are only 24 years old do you understand how much life you have yet to live. Computer skills are a great quality to have especially with the way things are moving forward, just take a look around find out what makes you happy and put more of your focus and attention into that. We have a long life ahead of us, no sense in thinking how small we are strive for the world we want to change."

DecidingToBeBetter,35465p,lifedreams,13,Wed May 6 23:21:58 2015 UTC,"Give up caring what other people think of you. I know it seems counter intuitive as we humans are primal pack animals that don’t want to be cast from the village, but spending time worrying what others think, is a waste of energy. You’ll never please everyone and it’s none of your business what others think of you.    I would like to know how other people in this sub have accomplished this. It seems to me it often really matters what others think of you, such as a job interviewer you want to impress, or your boss. While it would be nice if your resume or work was all that mattered, that doesn't seem to match reality."
DecidingToBeBetter,35465p,greenkey901,6,Wed May 6 23:38:00 2015 UTC,"Obviously, you will care, to some degree, what people think of you. A better way to put it would be ""Give up worrying about what other people think of you."" I feel it's a ""Be who you are"" kind of statement. You need to be happy with yourself first, the rest will follow.   I highly suggest reading The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. He does an amazing job describing how to not worry about the past or future, neither of which you can control, and helps you focus on the current moment and also how to be happy with yourself."
DecidingToBeBetter,35465p,DahmerRape,3,Thu May 7 01:07:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for responding - here is a specific situation. I am 36 and my whole life an issue has come up over and over. My tone of voice is a problem and makes people think I mean something other than I intended. I'm aware of it and I work very hard to say exactly what I mean with appropriate tone. But today I was called into a meeting with three of my managers about this issue because I gravely offended the trainer in a training class by my questions (which I thought were appropriate and I thought would be helpful clarifications). Basically I'm in trouble because if what they think of me. I would love to learn how not to care since the way I talk just IS the way I talk. But....i have management on my back and I feel really low tonight thinking over how many times this has come up in my life.
DecidingToBeBetter,35465p,greenkey901,4,Thu May 7 01:28:20 2015 UTC,"That's definitely a tough situation. It's unfortunate you are being reprimanded for someone misconceiving your intentions or ""tone"" of voice. Try and talk to management about the situation and your feelings, and possibly even how people tend to take you the wrong way. It'll either go your way, or it won't. If it doesn't go your way, perhaps it's time to look for a new job, ideally one with more like-minded coworkers. I know it's all easier said than done, but I feel communication, or lack thereof, is what will make or break situations like yours. To me, it simply doesn't make sense to feel low or bad about how many times it has come up in your life. It's apparently who/how you are. It'd be like being upset because you have brown hair, or your height. It's who you are, and that is what you need to remember. If others have problems with it, and they will...oh well."
DecidingToBeBetter,35465p,DahmerRape,2,Thu May 7 01:44:53 2015 UTC,"I have this exact same problem, I have since I was a child. It's been an issue in multiple jobs and relationships. I wish I had some advice for you but since I'm still working on my own ""tone"" issues (which boils down to mainly trying to be extremely mindful of the way in which I say things, all the things, all the time) all I can really do is sympathize and let you know you're not alone."
DecidingToBeBetter,35465p,ErinGlaser,1 point,Thu May 7 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"I think for most, age is a big factor. When we're young, our entire world is mostly contained within the walls of our home and our school. It's hard to not care what others think because we're trapped in these environments the majority of our lives; caring what others think is necessary for survival. The most trivial of offenses are magnified at this scale.  Then most people join the workforce or go to college and begin to see the bigger picture. They start a career and a family and their consciousness expands globally. Now, something as trivial as what someone said to someone else about you means so little to everything else going on your life: child, wife, career, mortgage, ailing family, civil rights battles, healthcare, taxes, war, genocide, and on and on. These events force you focus on things you never had to before: homelessness, poor health, financial constraints, etc. Who cares if someone said my shoes looked hideous, I'm wearing them to protect my MCL from tearing further, go fuck yourself.  Of course, there are many exceptions to this story, but I think for Americans this is the experience of the majority."

DecidingToBeBetter,35465p,Rlysrh,4,Thu May 7 12:30:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like this list is missing one important point: Give up 10 minutes of your day to meditate.   Seriously, I've been meditating every day since new years day, ranging from 5 to 20 minutes a day and I've found myself caring so much less about what other people think of me, its easier for me to let go of embarrassing things, and not spend hours dwelling on them. I don't constantly re-live conversations from each day in my head until I've convinced myself that some minor thing I did was actually really weird/embarrasing. I don't hate the boring things I have to do every day anymore, like public transport and walking the same way to work. I find it easier to completely unwind and relax after work too. Its easier to let go of things that make me angry. I feel more life satisfaction overall. I feel more confident. The list could go on.  I used an app called headspace to start out, but now I've got the hang of it I just set a timer on my phone and just sit, concentrate on my breathing and the sounds around me, and I try to listen to the silence in my head. If anyone wants to start meditating, I'd reccommend either using headspace or just googling 'mindfulness meditation'. There are so many guided meditations on youtube, including some LOTR themed ones which are fun. (search for 'middle earth meditations')"
DecidingToBeBetter,35465p,mal5305,2,Thu May 7 17:24:50 2015 UTC,"i second this. meditation can be difficult and frustrating to get into, but start yourself out at a time length you think you can handle, even if it's only a few minutes.  it's less of ""thinking about nothing"" and more of ""letting go"". i would also recommend the Headspace app to help start out."

DecidingToBeBetter,35465p,almondbutter1,2,Thu May 7 14:56:03 2015 UTC,"EDIT: No idea how to fix the formatting, so they're all just gonna be #1 apparently.    All quotes will be from here: http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html  There's a lot of overlap here, and some of these quotes are not explicitly used for the contexts I have them in, but if you read them with an open mind, you can see how they apply.     Give up caring what other people think of you.    ""When any person harms you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he acts or speaks from a supposition of its being his duty. Now, it is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but what appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from a wrong appearance, he is the person hurt, since he too is the person deceived. For if anyone should suppose a true proposition to be false, the proposition is not hurt, but he who is deceived about it. Setting out, then, from these principles, you will meekly bear a person who reviles you, for you will say upon every occasion, ""It seemed so to him."" ""  ""Remember, that not he who gives ill language or a blow insults, but the principle which represents these things as insulting. When, therefore, anyone provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion which provokes you. Try, therefore, in the first place, not to be hurried away with the appearance. For if you once gain time and respite, you will more easily command yourself. ""   Give up trying to please everyone.   ""When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, never shun the being seen to do it, even though the world should make a wrong supposition about it; for, if you don't act right, shun the action itself; but, if you do, why are you afraid of those who censure you wrongly? ""  ""If you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, so as to wish to please anyone, be assured that you have ruined your scheme of life. Be contented, then, in everything with being a philosopher; and, if you wish to be thought so likewise by anyone, appear so to yourself, and it will suffice you. ""   Give up participating in gossip.    ""Does anyone bathe in a mighty little time? Don't say that he does it ill, but in a mighty little time. Does anyone drink a great quantity of wine? Don't say that he does ill, but that he drinks a great quantity. For, unless you perfectly understand the principle from which anyone acts, how should you know if he acts ill? Thus you will not run the hazard of assenting to any appearances but such as you fully comprehend. ""   Quit worrying.    ""Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things. Death, for instance, is not terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death that it is terrible. When therefore we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles. An uninstructed person will lay the fault of his own bad condition upon others. Someone just starting instruction will lay the fault on himself. Some who is perfectly instructed will place blame neither on others nor on himself. ""   Let go of insecurity.    ""Don't allow such considerations as these distress you. ""I will live in dishonor, and be nobody anywhere."" For, if dishonor is an evil, you can no more be involved in any evil by the means of another, than be engaged in anything base. Is it any business of yours, then, to get power, or to be admitted to an entertainment? By no means. How, then, after all, is this a dishonor? And how is it true that you will be nobody anywhere, when you ought to be somebody in those things only which are in your own control, in which you may be of the greatest consequence? ""But my friends will be unassisted."" -- What do you mean by unassisted? They will not have money from you, nor will you make them Roman citizens. Who told you, then, that these are among the things in our own control, and not the affair of others? And who can give to another the things which he has not himself? ""Well, but get them, then, that we too may have a share."" If I can get them with the preservation of my own honor and fidelity and greatness of mind, show me the way and I will get them; but if you require me to lose my own proper good that you may gain what is not good, consider how inequitable and foolish you are. Besides, which would you rather have, a sum of money, or a friend of fidelity and honor? Rather assist me, then, to gain this character than require me to do those things by which I may lose it. Well, but my country, say you, as far as depends on me, will be unassisted. Here again, what assistance is this you mean? ""It will not have porticoes nor baths of your providing."" And what signifies that? Why, neither does a smith provide it with shoes, or a shoemaker with arms. It is enough if everyone fully performs his own proper business. And were you to supply it with another citizen of honor and fidelity, would not he be of use to it? Yes. Therefore neither are you yourself useless to it. ""What place, then, say you, will I hold in the state?"" Whatever you can hold with the preservation of your fidelity and honor. But if, by desiring to be useful to that, you lose these, of what use can you be to your country when you are become faithless and void of shame. ""  ""You may be unconquerable, if you enter into no combat in which it is not in your own control to conquer. When, therefore, you see anyone eminent in honors, or power, or in high esteem on any other account, take heed not to be hurried away with the appearance, and to pronounce him happy; for, if the essence of good consists in things in our own control, there will be no room for envy or emulation. But, for your part, don't wish to be a general, or a senator, or a consul, but to be free; and the only way to this is a contempt of things not in our own control. """
DecidingToBeBetter,35465p,almondbutter1,1 point,Fri May 8 02:53:35 2015 UTC,"Stop taking everything personally.    ""If anyone tells you that such a person speaks ill of you, don't make excuses about what is said of you, but answer: "" He does not know my other faults, else he would not have mentioned only these."" ""  ""If a person gave your body to any stranger he met on his way, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in handing over your own mind to be confused and mystified by anyone who happens to verbally attack you? ""   Give up the past.    ""Never say of anything, ""I have lost it""; but, ""I have returned it."" Is your child dead? It is returned. Is your wife dead? She is returned. Is your estate taken away? Well, and is not that likewise returned? ""But he who took it away is a bad man."" What difference is it to you who the giver assigns to take it back? While he gives it to you to possess, take care of it; but don't view it as your own, just as travelers view a hotel. ""   Give up spending money on what you don’t need in effort to buy happiness.    ""The body is to everyone the measure of the possessions proper for it, just as the foot is of the shoe. If, therefore, you stop at this, you will keep the measure; but if you move beyond it, you must necessarily be carried forward, as down a cliff; as in the case of a shoe, if you go beyond its fitness to the foot, it comes first to be gilded, then purple, and then studded with jewels. For to that which once exceeds a due measure, there is no bound. ""  ""Don't be prideful with any excellence that is not your own. If a horse should be prideful and say, "" I am handsome,"" it would be supportable. But when you are prideful, and say, "" I have a handsome horse,"" know that you are proud of what is, in fact, only the good of the horse. What, then, is your own? Only your reaction to the appearances of things. Thus, when you behave conformably to nature in reaction to how things appear, you will be proud with reason; for you will take pride in some good of your own. ""  ""These reasonings are unconnected: ""I am richer than you, therefore I am better""; ""I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better."" The connection is rather this: ""I am richer than you, therefore my property is greater than yours;"" ""I am more eloquent than you, therefore my style is better than yours."" But you, after all, are neither property nor style. ""   Give up anger.    ""Begin therefore from little things. Is a little oil spilt? A little wine stolen? Say to yourself, ""This is the price paid for apathy, for tranquillity, and nothing is to be had for nothing."" When you call your servant, it is possible that he may not come; or, if he does, he may not do what you want. But he is by no means of such importance that it should be in his power to give you any disturbance. ""   Give up control.   ""Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.  The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.  Aiming therefore at such great things, remember that you must not allow yourself to be carried, even with a slight tendency, towards the attainment of lesser things. Instead, you must entirely quit some things and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would both have these great things, along with power and riches, then you will not gain even the latter, because you aim at the former too: but you will absolutely fail of the former, by which alone happiness and freedom are achieved.  Work, therefore to be able to say to every harsh appearance, ""You are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be."" And then examine it by those rules which you have, and first, and chiefly, by this: whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or those which are not; and, if it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you. ""  ""When you are going about any action, remind yourself what nature the action is. If you are going to bathe, picture to yourself the things which usually happen in the bath: some people splash the water, some push, some use abusive language, and others steal. Thus you will more safely go about this action if you say to yourself, ""I will now go bathe, and keep my own mind in a state conformable to nature."" And in the same manner with regard to every other action. For thus, if any hindrance arises in bathing, you will have it ready to say, ""It was not only to bathe that I desired, but to keep my mind in a state conformable to nature; and I will not keep it if I am bothered at things that happen.

Monday Wednesday Friday, school days. Simply put the blockers on for those specific days, and start looking for things you can enjoy about school. Start separating your life into blocks by day or time period - it's totally fine to play games if you've done your homework for that day. Or if you're working on a project, and you're still on time, you can say ""I'll keep working on this for 30 more minutes, and then I'll play the rest of the night"". Be honest with yourself. Don't be so harsh.  I struggle with the exact same issues. Sometimes I have a really shitty day and I just want to veg out. Other days will be good, and I say to myself ""Today is going well, I still have some shit to do but I want to keep this train going, so I'm putting off fun for a few more hours""  If you find yourself still hating your life/self after a few weeks of trying this out, maybe look for a therapist, you can google low-fee therapy in your area or check out psychologytoday.com. If you're like me, it's not so much of an addiction as it is an escape from all the shitty shit in life. ;)   Also, another school year is not the end of the world - I've dropped out of college, and skipped tons of classes, and I only need 3 credits to get a goddamned degree - but now I'm working full time and can't even go back because I'm trying to deal with all the other stuff I've got going on.

For whatever reason you've decided that video games/convincing yourself that you'd be left out is a valid reason to be skipping school. I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but I just think it's complete laziness that's holding you back.  Do you pay for school yourself? If you don't, maybe you don't realize just how much money you're wasting. I would never even THINK about skipping class considering how much I have to pay every semester.   I guess my advice would be is that if you're scared your parents will kick you out, do what it takes to get rid of that fear."
DecidingToBeBetter,34yi3m,leslietheriveter,3,Tue May 5 17:32:16 2015 UTC,"My friends don't coerce me into playing video games with them, its just that I feel left out since they are on most of the time, and then I convince myself to skip. I just feel like I will get depressed b/c my friends are a big part of my life. I don't pay for school rn, but i feel like maybe if I do start paying for school, it would be better, since it will be coming out of my own pocket and not my parents money. I guess I just don't know what to do in this situation I'm in rn, with the semester closing in, and I haven't been to one class in a month, I don't know if there's a chance for me to pass that class (I'm currently taking 2 classes, the one class i haven't been to in a month, the other I've missed a couple of classes but not too much)."
DecidingToBeBetter,34yi3m,Cosmonaut_Kramer,7,Tue May 5 18:10:17 2015 UTC,"Try to recruit your friends as encouragement.  Give them your class schedule so that when you're Skypeing or playing games they can tell you to stop and go to class.  Make it a team effort.  If they're good friends, they'll support you."
DecidingToBeBetter,34yi3m,smiles0,2,Tue May 5 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day, your friends are going to be the ones missing out. An education means a lot, opens up a lot of doors you've never even seen before. If they want to play games all day then maybe they are not the type of friends you need. Surround yourself with people that want to succeed beyond getting to the next level or beating the next boss. Life is long. Video games are not."
DecidingToBeBetter,34yi3m,meizakat,0,Tue May 5 22:40:18 2015 UTC,Maybe you can suggest to your parents that you start paying for part of or all of school. Explain to them that you have a problem with feeling left out if you don't play video games with your friends. Tell them you want to fix this and you may need their help. There's nothing wrong with needing help. You could try setting up a reward plan for video games. Like you're only allowed to play video games for this long if you get x done. Maybe enlist your friends to help too. A therapist might also be good to help you deal with feeling left out. There could even be a different reason contributing to you skipping class that therapy would help you figure out.
DecidingToBeBetter,34yi3m,JohnnyBrillcream,6,Wed May 6 00:26:08 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat 7 or so years ago. I would constantly skip classes to stay home and play video games. I didn't even have a dedicated group of friends to play with, it was just an escape mechanism for me. It took the school kicking me out and telling me to come back in a year after reevaluating to make any changes. I never went back to that program.  It took me a while, but I realized that the reason I didn't go wasn't because I wanted to play video games or talk with the few people I met through the game, it was because I just didn't want to go. I had one or two classes I genuinely enjoyed, but the rest of them I despised going to. I disliked the material, I disliked the program, and I was lazy. I didn't want to learn, so I stopped going to class. Being kicked out was the best thing to happen to me. Five years later I went back to school for something I found a passion for - I'll be graduating next month!   I think you need to take some time to consider what you want. Take a day, take a week, take a year if you have to. Are you happy in your program, or are you just doing it for the diploma? Will this program get you to a place you want to be? Do you have something you're passionate about? If so, dedicate yourself to learn. Exercise discipline and get through those courses. Find a friend that will help keep you on track - if they're in your program even better, you've found yourself a study buddy! If not, take a year (or five) off from school, don't keep wasting your time and money. Work at your job, earn some money, get tired of that job, discover your passion."
DecidingToBeBetter,34yi3m,leslietheriveter,3,Tue May 5 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"I skipped classes when I went to college, why? I didn't want to be there.   First decide if you even want to go to college. Take all the other factors you mentioned out of the equation, don't waste your time or money on something that will never afford you any return. It's foolish, especially if you are doing it to keep your parents happy. My exact story.  I finally had to grow up and have an adult conversation with my parents. They weren't happy but I assured them I wanted to work.  And that's what I did, I loved work.  You mentioned you like the sandwich shop but don't want to make that your life.  Don't.  But also don't think it is not helping you learn about life. You are in a business environment, learn from it. Strive to make shift manager or higher. Take that experience with you as you move up the ladder. If you are in an area with a somewhat strong economy you WILL move up that ladder. Being able to work with and manage people is a valuable asset that can translate to a wide spectrum of jobs.  You mention your friends. I'm tossing a dart here, you enjoy the job because you get to interact with people, your coworkers. They have somewhat become friends. Good. This will help you. You need friends to make you feel whole, a group of work friends will do that.  Relax, your young. You have time, just don't find yourself wasting a lot of it.  Also listen to this when you get down, it will give you a little boost."

Can you start by skipping video games for an entire day just to see how it feels? What if you physically move your setup away from you? (If it's a laptop, can you print out whatever needed for school and put the computer in the attic? If it's a desktop, just put the monitor in a closet. If you're xboxing, put that in the closet except for Saturdays till you get your life in order.)  Right now, you need to learn enough to pass your exams and not flunk out. How do you do that? Is it doable at all? Write out how you do this, if at all. Is there tutoring? Study sessions? How many hours per day do you need to catch up on the essential reading, study sheets, question sets, flashcards, etc? Can you find someone from class to chat with about it?   You also need to maintain your relationship with your parents. They might appreciate it if you ask them for help with this. Are they helpful? Are they competent functioning adults?  As always: sleep, eat, exercise, and try a daily short (ten minute) meditation practice. The first three are mandatory."

I don't really have any friends in my class to talk about how the class went today, I'm a pretty shy guy, and I keep to myself most of the time, even to my parents. As for my relationship with my parents, I'd say I'm pretty close to my mom (you could call me a moma's boy), but my dad is a different story. I've never really been close with my dad. He can be kind of a dick sometimes, and its frustrating to talk to him. He is overall very smart, (he used to be an airplane engineer), as I would like to somewhat follow his footsteps, not as a airplane engineer, but as a computer hardware engineer, and as for sleep, I don't get enough because all of my friends are on late, so I end up staying up late with them as well, I wanna say I eat pretty healthy compared to my friends, and as for exercise, I workout 5 days a week, and I've been doing that for about 2 weeks so far."

As for my personal opinion, employers don't like the idea of training someone to see him leave in a few months, but usually that can be handled properly.

DecidingToBeBetter,34wmxn,babblingme,13,Tue May 5 04:08:02 2015 UTC,"Hello there!   I think you should really take off a week, and start brainstorming. Start a new document and write down what are your inner goals and desires. It will be hard at the beginning, but after a few paragraphs you will slowly start to be honest with yourself.  Firstly just imagine yourself who you want to become in a year. If you think you're satisfied with what you see, just start to write down what you have to do to get there.  Break down this to-dos to daily habits and start to implement them into your life. My favorite tool for that is habitrpg.com, for me it worked like charm.  Meditation can have a great effect on your life too, I suggest you to start with the app called Headspace. It explains the basics and mindset of mindfulness and meditation from the very beginning, I can't think of a better place to start.  Also start a journal in which you are truly honest with yourself and just write down your thoughts without judging them.   I think that will be enough for beginning, if you have any question, feel free to pm me ;)"
DecidingToBeBetter,34wmxn,mrm4rc1,7,Tue May 5 04:42:13 2015 UTC,"Though self-help books might seem a little tacky, one book that has really helped me is The NOW Habit.  It is a short read, so it is definitely worth looking in to.  Essentially, the book discusses why we procrastinate; most of our procrastination stems from our inner-voices that tend to bring us down.  Even if procrastination is not your problem, this book tackles self-criticism in a way that is logical and structured.   Again, I don't advocate using self-help books to fix your life, but I would try to keep an open mind about this one."

It is the fear of failure, the fear of being imperfect, and the fear of impossible expectations that prevent us from acting  Procrastination is not a character defect, rather, it is an attempt at coping with the often incapacitating fear of having our worth help up for judgement  The fear of judgement is the key fear that stems from over-identifying who you are, your worth as a person, with your work   damn. awesome. thanks for this!"

I'm 35 and I'm finally starting to resolve some of the questions and issues you're dealing with now. finding a direction takes a long, long time and lots of introspection. focus on the process, not the destination. some good books have been recommended, but i really think you'd benefit from Unstuck.  One important thing to keep in mind is that while you may feel like you are 'waiting for life to happen,' this is life. it's the whole process, the whole journey. to extend the journey metaphor, right now you're unfortunately facing a slight delay in a shitty airport. that's cool, the plane will take off eventually. you're right to incorporate meditation into your life. it'll help you to be aware and appreciative of the airport - the sounds, the smells, the feelings - rather than dwelling on being a bit stuck.   I wish you all the best. You're gonna be fine."
DecidingToBeBetter,34wmxn,Curt04,6,Tue May 5 13:28:09 2015 UTC,I know how you feel. I've been there. A lot of people are and they go their whole lives lying to themselves about how they feel. At least you have enough self awareness and honesty to recognize it. Your passion doesn't have to be your job. Of course it seems like you have realized this after pursuing a college degree you didn't really care about (again i've been there).   You should try to find a new job. I don't belive that you have to have a job that pays a lot but find a job with less stress. Why make $10 an hour with no benefits and still work like you are making twice as much? I don't know about the job market where you are but there should be jobs in that same range that are simple. That will give you more energy in your off time to really figure out and pursue what your real passions are and maybe meet some new friends or boyfriends while you are at it.

I have never had any idea what I wanted to do with my life, never had really any ambitions or a great thought of ""that's the job for me""  (except for idiotic fantasies). It is the weirdest thing, I never really clicked with anything in school or activities, and it made it so weird that I feel like I am adrift. Eventually I will land on something, but till then, who knows.  I am searching for jobs better than the one I am currently in, but in reality, I have no clue if the job I will get will be something I like because I have no real ambitions.  Right now, things I am doing is working on are resume builders like certificates, hoping my brain will click and say ""this is for me"".  Hobbies like Longboarding, Gardening, and manly construction things like painting and using concrete and swinging an ax like a lumberjack.   I'm thinking of taking up an instrument, but not sure which one. Thinking of taking up an out door activity, but not sure which one.   Do things that you feel you can start off and understand the basics and not get discouraged.  If you go with something that is hard (to you) and you quit you may feel worse.  My advice: hiking, aerobics, Zumba, things that require using arms and legs. Cooking and if you can do it cheaply even better. Learn news languages, or software.     (unless someone knows how I can make money watching t.v./netflix/hulu/youtube and playing candy crush)   Start a blog.  ""Babbling On: Whats new on Hulu"".  That's all I got best of luck to you."

You sound like you have a lot of insight into your problems and that's a great first step because you can't really solve problems that you don't know you have.  Now it's just a matter of time and experimenting and trial and error. No one can tell you what you should or will be passionate about, you just have to try different things. Give anything you can a shot, and see if it's something you can get excited about. If not, then try something else. It's not a failure if you can't get excited, it's the normal process of self discovery. Once you do find something you can be excited about, confidence will come, and you'll start to think of goals for the future. For now, just get out there and try new things."

It's very low carb and some of the restrictions seemed arbitrary (they have this rule about 'don't eat anything that looks like food you like!' which seems ridiculous). I can share more of my experience if you are interested. It might work better for you. Good luck!
DecidingToBeBetter,34vpai,idamayer,1 point,Tue May 5 01:20:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I should also mention I think it matters a lot whether you currently pack your lunch / cook all your own food and whether you eat pretty healthy now. It didn't work well for me because I eat most of my meals in a cafeteria and normally eat pretty healthy, so Whole30 left me making decisions like ""that salad looks delicious but there's a tiny bit of cheese on it, so I guess I have to eat an entire plate of sweet potatoes instead"""
DecidingToBeBetter,34q91v,CrisNikolov,29,Sun May 3 16:29:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is one very bad title.  ""35 Things happy people have in common"" would have made more sense."
DecidingToBeBetter,34q91v,unfinisher,5,Sun May 3 20:10:26 2015 UTC,"For me 15 years ago this would be ""35 things I will never have in my life"" or worse. Today I could give you a painful story of how I came to learn each of these things.  The ""problem"" is that there is no explanation of how to get there. You can't just decide to believe these things, they kind of need to be beaten into you via misery until you give up and desperate to try anything. In the mean time it just looks like exactly as you describe.  It is also totally subjective. They are paths you either believe you are on, or not, and WANT to be on, or not. Such beliefs can be very powerful, and also exhausting."
DecidingToBeBetter,34q91v,adelie42,2,Mon May 4 09:13:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Now I am at a point in my life where all/most of these are true (or at least, some of them I am aware of and being mindful of to obtain) but it was not an easy ride.   The change happened almost imperceptibly. My life was very sad in the past though.   Edit: Maybe not all that sounds cocky but I mean I am happy now, before I was not. It is a nice list but kind of defeating to someone who is already struggling, they may feel worse knowing they are ""unsuccessful""."
DecidingToBeBetter,34q91v,collegehelpmycareer,3,Mon May 4 10:54:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know what is cocky about that. In a way you have merely managed to manage the pain, but at the same tile it feels huge if you decide to.  Some of the changes were imperceptible for me, but some of them, as I said, had to be beaten in to me. For example, ""12. You know the importance of saying ‘no’."" was something I thought I knew until I got into a work environment where I had what I will call ""unlimited opportunity to express my potential"". It was brutal. It was one of the most painful voluntary experiences (meaning I kind of knew what I was getting myself into) of my life. I very nearly said ""fuck it!"" to everybody and everything I had worked for. Once I calmed down I realized a much more reasonable, but more difficult, approach was to manage my priorities. Someone once described it as, ""weighing your cart before adding another stone"". If you wait till the cart is too heavy to pull, you will need to break promises and let people down who may have been depending on you. The problem is that you need to anticipate which ""straw will break the camel's back"".  When people are looking for help, they poll. They will seek out people to help them. If you say ""no"", they will just move on because for them that is the next step in getting the job done. It is also universal, meaning that everybody can do it; if everybody does what they can do well at their pace and honest about what they can do and can't do, collective productivity is maximized and misery is minimized. I've seen people treat stress like a status symbol, and in the past I tried to respect it; now I just see it as poor management and leadership. In such cases I only try and lead by example rather than be forced to resonate with it. Same goes for people appear to confuse work ethic with being in a constant state of crisis.  Anyway, congrats for feeling good about your path. Happy travels!"
DecidingToBeBetter,34q91v,adelie42,1 point,Mon May 4 11:21:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks, congrats to you too!! I loved reading your insight/experience.   I am similar to you...while I would say collectively this happiness happened almost imperceptibly, thinking back individually to each one (for example, saying no) there were some very hard lessons I had to go through.   It's really important to be aware of bad behaviours/habits and notice them when they are happening so you can shut them down or solve them. For example I think complaining was on the list? Sometimes I find myself complaining about such little things and I have to shut myself up and remjnd myself that there are things to be happy...if the thing I am complaining about is serious I stop myself and think, ""Well, what are my options going forward to solving this problem?"" As opposed to in the past suffering and feeling like I had no control over my life."
DecidingToBeBetter,34q91v,collegehelpmycareer,2,Mon May 4 11:41:38 2015 UTC,"I guess the lessons were hard and sudden, but the increased happiness really did creep up on me. I think I see what you are saying there and certainly agree.  I was kind of the opposite extreme on the complaining part, sort of. I rarely complained about anything to anybody, and if I did it was only after hyper rationalizing the need to say something, and even then it had to be tied to some external factor. It was never because of how I felt, at least not directly. It has only been within the past year that I discovered that all this work being ""nice"" actually made me an asshole. Many aspects of what I thought were ""good relationships"" were based on what I thought the other person felt while the reality was that on my side I was always resentful. I just thought I was good at hiding it (and lying to myself) for the sake of the relationship. Looking back makes me facepalm.  I am still good (at least as much as ever, I think) at being calm and collected, but I decided many months ago now that I would try just being brutally honest with people and kind of ""letting chips fall where they will"" and not try and control or mitigate their reaction (or acknowledge to myself that I was consciously building a shitty relationship). It is still kind of a work in progress, but I am very often left a bit in shock at how much people appreciate or otherwise respond positively.   ""Well, what are my options going forward to solving this problem?""   The past is just data that you have available to make the best decision you can in this moment, and shame over the process or what information you might not know that would let you make a better decision is a waste of time unless you come back at it with that same question, ""what are my options going forward?"". More and more often I find myself shamelessly asking for help and communicating what I don't know and where I could use some assistance; and once again, this has improved practically every relationship in my life more than I could have ever hoped for. I mean, I was just desperately hoping for ""not so bad that I can't recover"". Man, that fear of vulnerability was such a waste of time.  Do you find some of these things to still require constant conscious effort, that is worth it, even after many years of practice, or have they mostly integrated into a sort of Standard Operating Procedure?"
DecidingToBeBetter,34q91v,adelie42,1 point,Mon May 4 13:03:05 2015 UTC,"That's great that your relationships improved. I think things like being able to speak up when something is wrong or asking for help, they make people around you respect you and like you more since you are being more honest and true to yourself.   Complaining is something I largely end up doing internally and then I get anxiety over it, but now with practice it is mostly a default process to move on. Whether these things are standard operation or active effort both have helped my quality of happiness.  Again I really like your insight, thank you!"
DecidingToBeBetter,34q91v,collegehelpmycareer,55,Mon May 4 16:43:36 2015 UTC,Some of these points made me feel worse about myself. Wow.
DecidingToBeBetter,34q91v,mirazsyed,9,Sun May 3 19:12:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah unfortunately that title combined with the way it was written belongs in Decided to be better, not deciding to be better.  Generally the points in the article are the goals you should aim for when thinking about how you think.  Meditating on the way your brain works and how you tend to look at life is extremely helpful.  If you keep in mind that many, but not necessarily all, of the points in this article are good targets to aim for, you can make your meditation even more productive.  Take, for instance, #7 : You love yourself instead of the idea of everyone else loving you.  That is extremely important in my opinion to living a happier life.  I used to be really depressed about a lot of things ..... it took a lot of introspection to come to terms with why I felt depressed over my place among other people in life rather than my own personal place with myself. Simply put, What do >I< want for myself, rather than what do other people want for me?  edit: Another big thing, in my opinion, is coming to terms with the difference between what is in MY control, and what are things I need to just accept. The article covers a lot of things that are generally within your own personal control. If you don't do those things, maybe spend a little time thinking about why, and if you are OK with that or not. Being OK with things is the goal, so if you are OK with it, then great! If not, then being honest with yourself will get you in the right direction."

They are part of the adventure! At least that is what you need to believe to get where you want to go.

If it doesn't get thick enough, add a bit more oil (or alternatively lemon juice) and blend again.  However be warned, it seemingly does not work with every possible soy milk / oil combination and not with every blender. So there's quite a possibility it won't work out on your first try. I had a few failed attempts in the beginning but since then I've made Mayo about 100 times without any problems.  Finally, about ""getting back in the game"", I'm sure you already know about /r/vegan, also feel free to bother me if you've got a problem, question or whatever. :>    For the record, I use this kind of blender, this oil and this (unsweetened) soy milk - however, considering you're not from Germany this probably isn't of much help as you have no access to these particular products. :|"

Apples and bananas are pretty cheap fruits. For veggies, spinach, kale (I buy both frozen so they last longer), cabbage, sweet potatoes, onions, peppers are all inexpensive. Then there are canned or dried beans, lentils, peanuts or peanut butter. There are a lot of cheap options in every category, it's just a list to pick from.

Spreading them out and freezing all the chunks/pieces separately on a cookie sheet first is the trick. Then bag. This ensures they won't stick together, making it easy to measure out as needed."

DecidingToBeBetter,34pfht,johnyp97,4,Mon May 4 07:19:19 2015 UTC,Try frozen veggies. They are usually wayyyy cheaper and still just as healthy.

DecidingToBeBetter,34pfht,CoochQuarantine,1 point,Sun May 3 14:29:07 2015 UTC,I've heard that frozen vegetables are actually healthier because the cold keeps the nutrients from degrading.

This made me reflect on previous relationships I had been in where maybe I was the one who was living with the anxiety of abandonment.  So with this in mind I offer you this advice:  Accept that you can only control you.  If you think you need help get help and reflect on your power there.  I'm no life guru but recognizing your power on your life is the first step of self validation.  This being said also keep in mind that depression and anxiety are real illnesses and you may need professional help.    Additionally do not let fear of losing a relationship prevent you from taking care of yourself.  Relationships come and go, sometimes they last sometimes they don't."

Doing all the giving is exhausting and doing all the taking will leave you morally bankrupt.  The equal give and take is what makes a healthy relationship.  From my experience I can say relationships are way more fun when both people are self assured.  It makes communication easier thus brings strength and clarity in direction.   While you cannot make another person do anything you can have more visibility about the future and be better prepared for it (which would reduce your anxiety).  One of my favorite quotes is ""You cannot direct the wind but you can adjust your sails"" (thanks Civ IV).  Your primary goal right now should be learning how to adjust those sails.  Find the power in yourself.  I can't tell you how to do that but I always felt flying a kite at the ocean was incredibly therapeutic.  Best wishes!"

So the second thing I guess I want you to know, is that you're already doing great by recognizing that this is something you need to fix.  One of the biggest things that helped me, and helped my relationship at the time, was finding a really good therapist and practicing cognitive behavioral therapy. Also, one day I sat down and tried to think about what would really, truly make me happy. I had long thought it was if my then boyfriend asked me to marry him, or wanted kids with me. But when I really thought about it and was honest with myself, even though those things would make me happy, I realized it wouldn't provide the fulfillment that I needed or wanted. It would only be a temporary satisfaction. So I had to figure out what it was that would really fulfill me. And that was really important, because I then realized that my happiness wasn't in the hands of someone else like I'd long thought it was, but it was actually in my own hands. It was really empowering."

That's not a way of telling you you're making excuses, it's an actual question.   If it happens that you're making excuses, it could help to say, maybe even out loud, ""THERE ARE CERTAIN MILD SENSATIONS INSIDE OF ME SO I CAN'T HANG OUT WITH MY FRIENDS""   Because that's what discomfort is.

I met so many new people and had so many new great experiences. I need to start doing this again more myself.  As to your question of how to do it, you just make the decision to do it. It's really that simple. You decide that, within reason, you're going to say yes to more opportunities, and then you do it. And even when you don't feel like leaving the house, which believe me, I'm one of those people too, you make yourself do it. But of course, use discretion. If you have finals coming up, that's a pretty good reason not to leave the house. I don't think you have to say yes more when you have legitimate reasons not to, but more when you just don't feel like it, or feel uncomfortable on the situation, etc. Those are the times need to force yourself to say yes. You kind of need to retrain your brain that saying yes can actually to good things."

DecidingToBeBetter,34lqrw,Beestonian,2,Sat May 2 07:36:45 2015 UTC,Sounds like empathy to me. Make sure you end your experience with your resolve and how they can take the lesson you learned and apply it to their situation. Although maybe the answer is just to listen more to what they're saying before you response. Sometimes all ya need is someone who'll listen longer than 10 seconds before pulling out their phone..
DecidingToBeBetter,34lqrw,JarofHearts,3,Sat May 2 07:47:10 2015 UTC,"Second this. Empathy doesn't mean you can't talk about yourself, it means the reason you're saying what you're saying is to try to be helpful to the other person, rather than to just talk about yourself.  Just hear the other person out as fully as possible, and try to listen for the implicit reason they're telling you their thing. Sometimes they just need to say something and have it heard, sometimes they just need to be told everything will be okay, and sometimes they're looking for advice or someone who can relate to what they're going through. Empathy is figuring out what that implicit request is."
DecidingToBeBetter,34lqrw,Renaissance8905,2,Sat May 2 08:40:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think your problem is with empathy.  I think you're doing fine with that, but you still may not be providing the support someone needs in a situation.  Perhaps try flat out asking them if they're coming to you for empathy, advice, or just someone to listen/vent to (or a combination), because not everyone needs/wants support in the same way.  This can seem a bit cold at first, but honestly it really can allow you to provide what someone actually needs out of an interaction.  Advice is pretty straight forward and I'd say empathizing is pretty much how you talk about it.  Trying to put yourself in their shoes by relating it to things you've experienced.  However, if you haven't experienced something as traumatic or deep as them, then you can run the risk of basically talking about how their broken arm reminds you of a papercut you had last Tuesday.  In that case, you need to switch to just listening.  (Also if you feel like you're running into the problem of constantly trying to ""one up"" people's trauma, try switching to just listening for awhile instead.)  Just listening is sometimes about sitting on things you WANT to say and merely focusing on validating their feelings and nothing else.  Saying something like ""Oh man, that sounds like it sucks!  I'm glad you're okay!"" and otherwise prompting them to vent their feelings out while honestly saying what parts you agree with their actions/emotions and basically trying not to speak as much as you may normally want to at first.  I find that the offer of physical comfort is often also a good part of learning just to listen to someone, because it's about validating and comforting them without putting yourself or your experiences in their mouth.  Tell them how shitty you think their boss/whatever is and then let them talk more."

Running 2 miles burns roughly 200 calories (granted, you'll burn more if you weigh more, so let's call it 400 for kicks.) If you're eating a surplus of 400 calories every day over your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure, it's what your metabolism burns just to keep you alive every day,) that run is doing nothing to make you lose weight. It's just keeping your head above water. On the flip side, you could eat 500 calories under your TDEE and lose weight without running at all.  Serious weight loss has to be done in the kitchen, and this often involves significant changes in a person's food habits and relationship with eating in general. If you want more information, check out the wiki on /r/fitness. I apologize if you already knew all of this.  Remember, a journey of a thousand miles is completed one step at a time. If you fall, just get up and keep going. It's a lifelong pursuit. Good luck man."

Losing weight doesn't change who you are. It doesn't fix problems, it fixes a symptom in most cases.  Learn to find joy in moving your body and being active. Learn to love cooking and eating healthy balanced meals. Start now. Love the journey."

DecidingToBeBetter,34ilnu,takishan,1 point,Sat May 2 01:59:26 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate this.  Today, I cleaned the laundry room, the kitchen, did a couple loads of dishes and got most of my laundry done. There's a lot of clothing there that's being sorted through, what's not being kept is being bagged and donated to one of the local poordrobes.  I'm not high-riding recently, it's been about a month of this type of mentality. It's stayed pretty steady, even with my landlords breathing down my neck and a continuing search for new roommates that's gotten stressful.  Now, to address your concerns of biting off more than I can chew, I've tried to break them down into a ""when this happens, then this starts happening"" sort of system with no real plan, just destinations. As for the concerns about dietary needs, me and the other housemates have come together and formed a standardized grocery list, so we are stocked up on dried beans and rice, frozen vegetables, chicken and fish, fruit and peanuts out the wazoo, juices, milk, teas and practically no over-sugared, fatty items in stock. That coupled with a better attempt on my part on portion control seem to be a good step in the right direction.  As I said, by all means, make suggestions."
DecidingToBeBetter,34ilnu,takishan,3,Fri May 1 21:27:48 2015 UTC,"No offense, but this sounds like mental masturbation.  Good job! You realize that you have potential and that you're wasting it. Thing is, that's only the first step in the million-step journey. Talk is cheap. It's the walking that really counts.  Life cannot be neatly mapped out. You will only overwhelm yourself trying to fit chaos into different sized boxes. Now, that doesn't mean you shouldn't put effort into changing into a better version if yourself. But please, for your own sake, take things one step at a time.  You want to draw? Start off drawing for minimum 3 minutes a day. (Once you start doing something, usually you will want to keep going. Make it a low minimum and it'll be easier not to procrastinate)   After a couple weeks of that, maybe you realize you don't want to draw. Maybe you realize you want to draw in a different style you couldn't predict before. Maybe your 'beautiful missus' that left but didn't really leave leaves again. Things change, and they can change rather quickly and violently. Do you see? The wise man makes plans that are flexible.   You sound like you had a difficult experience growing up. Worse than others, better than some. It doesn't mean anything. You simply are what you are. People have done a lot more with a lot less than you have and there are people that would cave immediately under the pressure you're facing. The point I'm trying to make is don't let your past become an excuse. I make this point because of your introduction outlining what got you into this position. It doesn't matter.  Also, I suggest starting off with your fitness and health related goals. You are grossly overweight and simply getting to a normal level will dramatically improve your mood and outlook on life. This will help you achieve other things faster.  Good luck and if you actually end up achieving any of your goals, post an update here to share with others."

Now, I'm not going to sit here and stroke your cock and tell you how big it is. A brief review of your comment history tells a pretty clear story about a cynical prick who doubts most of the things that he/she sees on the Internet, and for good reason, but that's just it. A lot of ""harsh truth"" comments that you have to read between the lines to get any form of sincerity from.  First off: I'm not making plans, outside of personal health goals, I'm setting destinations. I'm a formally trained artist, but I'm running myself through a series of refreshers. In effect, nothing new, just retraining myself to get back into old, artistic habits. I already have time set aside for it and everything.  Don't misquote, it was ""wonderful"" not ""beautiful"". The leaving, but not really leaving was a euphemism for a more spiritual loss, her finally succumbing to a sense of loss and the beginning of a separation from me. Like I said, I want to rekindle my passion and romanticism for her, but I'm doing for myself. Ergo, so if something does happen between us, that part remains intact.  Frankly, the past does matter. It's context. It's where you've come from. A ""wise man"" wouldn't discount that.  Thanks for the suggestion, it was a thought that had crossed my mind.

And perhaps from your missus.    You wake up. The hour does not matter to you anymore, because you have nowhere to be, and nothing to do. This is the curse of man, you think to yourself, as you do every morning. Waking up. Consciousness. Death would be preferable, if only you had the courage to seek it out.  You stumble towards the kitchen and make a dull mockery of what was once known as breakfast. The less effort you put into it, the better. You make your coffee, without which you couldn’t bear to attempt the long walk between your kitchen and your computer room, and then you enter your prison.  8 hours later, you realize you’ve wasted the best part of another day. You’ve done nothing, attempted nothing, learned nothing. Deep inside of you is a man, a real man, a screaming person in chains. He hates you, and you’re afraid of him. You once wanted to be this man, but along the way you decided his path was too difficult. You chose a different road, of safety, and comfort, and hatred towards those who do what you can’t. You followed this road as far as anyone can follow it and remain sane. And too late did you realize that it was a downhill road, covered with a slippery layer of frost, and the further you go, the steeper it gets. With every day you don’t stop, you make it harder for yourself to crawl back up the mountain. And it’s a long, hard crawl.  So you surrender yourself to the descent, letting it take you as deep as it can, and you ignore the desperate screams of the suffering spirit chained inside you, but ignore it as you will, it’s echo still reaches you.  “This is not the way that you’re meant to live.” And then, one day, you stop. You stop long enough to appreciate the strength of will it takes to stop, and then you’re off again. You underestimated how hard it would be.  But even that little effort gives hope to the prisoner inside you, and hope is the only sustenance a man truly needs. You stop again and again, and relapse and fail, but every time you stop, you last a little longer, and the man inside you comes closer and closer to breaking his chains.  And then one of the chains break. Hope gives way to fury. You stop. But you don’t resume sliding. You begin the upwards crawl. The mountain still looms enormous, but now the man inside is breaking his chains in a demented rage and you feel his strength carrying you up. You climb, and climb, and then without expecting it, you realize the prisoner inside you has broken his last chain some time ago. You have let him take over, and you have become the man you had in you since you were born. And now you’re at the top of the mountain, fitter and stronger than you’ve ever been in your life, and you see that it’s only the first mountain in a range where each coming mountain is taller than the last. The range has no end, the peaks climbing eternal into the sky. Each one is a hard climb. Each one intimidates you. But now the man inside you is running the show, and the difficulty is a challenge you’re only too happy to take on.  You wake up. It’s 6am, and the hour matters. You wouldn’t sleep past 6 for anyone or anything. You’re out of the house by 7, fresh and clean and energized by a freezing shower and a well made breakfast. You’re on the road, and you know where you’re going. Maybe to the field, to race against yourself, the most difficult opponent you will ever face. Maybe to the water, once again, to race against yourself. Maybe you’re on the bike, or on the rock, or on the mountain, or in the river. Maybe you’re in the air.  You know this is what you’re meant to do. This is living. This is courage. This is confidence. This is what it means to be alive. At some point, however, you stop and ask yourself.. Where is the coward? Where is the doubter? Where is that old deformed being who dragged me into the darkness and kept me in chains so long ago? Does he also exist deep inside me, a prisoner but still alive, still hopeful, still waiting for his return?  And the answer comes to you in the silence – you can’t hear him anymore. You haven’t heard him for a long time. You were sustained through the darkness by hope, and hope is a brave man’s mistress. The coward had nothing, and starved to death long ago.

DecidingToBeBetter,34hdg6,MyMonochromeLife,10,Fri May 1 04:26:29 2015 UTC,"Read the book Who Moved My Cheese. It talks about people and change--folks who are scared to make changes, refuse to, or even ones who make changes early. I wish I had read it much earlier in life.   As a teacher, I can promise you that you will always find students and parents you love and cherish. Finding a positive working environment is much rarer and valuable. Finding a place where the admin treats you well is also rare and valuable.   If you love teaching, please find an environment where you are happy, even outside of the classroom."

DecidingToBeBetter,34hdg6,unvaluablespace,2,Sat May 2 04:40:53 2015 UTC,It's a good point. But in my country it's not wise to move around a lot with jobs. Makes you seem undependable.
DecidingToBeBetter,34hdg6,midnyghtchilde,8,Fri May 1 15:30:47 2015 UTC,"Its cool that you love your students and their parents, but if you truly feel like your coworkers are bringing you down with them, then you need to make a change to make YOURSELF happy. prior to my current job (in which so far I'm finally TRULY happy at), I wasn't very happy with my previous ones. That was beside the point though, as a happy environment makes working for everyone much better. Those that refuse to realize or accept that just want to bring those down with them. No one says you have to be the annoying ""always cheery"" one, but its always nice to try and find a positive light on all subjects of your position. I had pretty cruddy low wage part time manual labor jobs, and most of the time my coworkers were always bummy about their job. I didn't care, and I'd either make a light hearted joke or try to point out the positives. Sometimes I'll even go out of my way to put a smile on their face.   The ones that refused to try and enjoy their job, I'd just shine them on, ignore them, or remind them that it could always be worse. If your coworkers hate their environment, maybe its time THEY move on and find another field that makes them happy, or another school to teach at if this one doesn't do it for them. They should be happy to teach and leave an impression on their students, the future of what may become. Maybe they have crappy kids to work with? Then perhaps they should reinvent their teaching methods to better reach out to their students.   Your not the problem: your coworkers are. Kids don't need to be in a learning environment full of asshole teachers that don't give a damn about their well being or potential. A lot of kids nowadays already have plenty of stress at home, personal struggles, family issues, etc that school should not feel like a chore for them, but a place to get away, while being inspired to learn.   I know this doesn't really help much, I don't know you, so my god I hope your actually good at teaching, but THANK YOU for being positive about your job. I personally don't have kids of my own, but I know that if I did, I'd want them to have a happy positive teacher that enjoyed their job enough to look forward to teaching my kid(s). Seriously, our school systems need more people like you teaching."
DecidingToBeBetter,34hdg6,cobalt503,3,Fri May 1 05:00:02 2015 UTC,"I second this advice. I will also add that while you can ignore 1 or 2 negative coworkers, the more of then there are, the harder it is for you to ignore them and try to be happy. It creates a toxic work environment, and unfortunately that is very very hard to change on your own.  OP basically has 2 options: find another school or district or try to get any other positive coworkers together and enact a change. Personally, I recommend the first option and hope that you find a new school with teachers who are not so jaded and negative. From friends that are teachers, I find a lot of older teachers are very cynical and jaded and negative and this seems to be a common issue."
DecidingToBeBetter,34hdg6,ShaolinPigeon,5,Fri May 1 13:05:32 2015 UTC,"Address them directly. Call them out on it. Teachers lounge drama. Make a broad statement at first and if none of the teachers get it address them individually. Like something teacher-like would be an overly cheerful colorful poster that says ""leave the negativity at home."" Teaching should be a positive environment. Then the next time someone says or does something specific, remember it and take them aside and pummel the shit out of them. JK violence is wrong. But seriously take them aside again in private area like the lounge and tell them their negativity is dragging you down and to keep it to themselves. Most logical people will have a moment of introspective clarity and realize they're fucking it up for the rest of us type thing. If it's only temporary the next time put them on blast in front of their peers. ""If you don't like your career choice, then move on, because no one cares to hear about it."""

I have seen first hand how hard it is to not take their negative attitude with you in a school environment. Teaching has a very tight knit social aspect and it is hard to avoid the negative, jaded people.   I tell her to remember she is an amazing teacher who is doing amazing things for the KIDS.

If you say that every time they start to bring on their attitude maybe it will start to grow in the back of their minds not to say anything. It might not work initially but if you're resilient with that phrase and constantly repeat it something might give. If they counter with another negative comment immediately reply with ""You know what I love? Roses"" or ""You know what I love? A blue sky."" or ""You know what I love? The smell of cinnamon."" Pretty soon you won't have to say your first comment but just tell them what you love and they will get the hint to keep it to themselves."

If you can't find other teachers as enthusiastic as you at your school then it might be time to look for a new school.  If you must stay where you are, keep the goal in mind - if the purpose of that field trip was to fire up the students, not the teachers, then mission accomplished!  And you can let the grouchy teachers fade into the background.  It sounds like you're accomplishing your goals as a teacher - remind yourself that changing your coworkers' attitudes is NOT your goal.  It may also help to seek out positive communities online - like on blogs or a subreddit or something.  Are there ANY other teachers with a positive attitude at your school?

We ought determine what is right through reason, and bend our will and intuition to conform with that ideal.  Still, I think there's something to be criticised in the notion that reason sort of trumps emotion; it plainly doesn't.  Our intuitive selves and reasoning selves can play nice, and they need to if you want to be effective at what you do.  But there are very good ethical reasons to be suspicious of our intuitions; most of us are unconscious racists and sexists, for example.  It cannot seriously be suggested that we ought regard our unconsciously racist and sexist intuitions as worthy of acting upon, let alone celebrating."

I feel like the article makes wide assumptions and then shoots them down (straw man?).  The article speaks about millions of years of evolution but doesn't go into the brain science of intuition. From what I understand, intuition stems from our subconscious mind (system 2 from Kahnemn's Thinking Fast and Slow for those who are familiar). Much of our intuition stems from past experiences and knowledge, so often this knowledge can be wrong or misunderstood. There are many great books that tackle the topic of intuition and biases. Intuition, however, does have it's place, especially when we have to make quick decisions and it is certainly something we should acknowledge when we have depression or anxiety. I agree with the article that we should explore what intuition says and pay attention to it.  I think a good example of intuition was Steve Jobs. He recognized the importance and value of intuition in India and sought to implement intuitive design in Apple products. He spent many years developing his intuition, as do other successful people, but even after success intuition isn't perfect though it's still pretty good. Yes, I'm generalizing here"

DecidingToBeBetter,34cr4n,porkgreen,11,Thu Apr 30 02:37:54 2015 UTC,"It's crazy how clear everything is from rock bottom. Listen, you clearly have the strength to push through your problems. You wouldn't have let your consciousness stream out like you just did if you didn't.   So here's the truth: even if you quit all the bullshit the moment you hit the save button, your odds of relapse are high. Almost all addicts relapse, and almost all relapse multiple times. But you have to remember this moment if you want to be better. Remember the misery that brought you here. Remember that the real you wants to stop, and even if you find yourself fucked up a few years from now, you will find the innate strength within you to quit again.  Keep quitting harder than you keep getting high. The real you wants that. You want sobriety. You want life free from chemical dependency and depression. And the people you love want those things for you, because they love you too.   So you have to stay strong, yes, but you also need people around you. You don't have to tell them all all your sins, though. Everybody deserves secrets and privacy. But you have to let your loved ones in. Let them know that you love and care about them, and you'll be blown away by how quickly the quality of your life can change.  And for heaven's sake, don't blame yourself for every little mistake you're definitely going to make. You know for a fact nobody's perfect. We all make mistakes. We all make HUGE mistakes that alter the courses of our lives foerever, but if we focus on making our lives and the lives of those we care about better, it turns out those mistakes fade into the past just like every awkward, shitty moment we've ever endured do.  So enjoy your life. Enjoy the company of loved ones and strangers. Enjoy the assholes who weave endlessly through traffic jams even though they're only saving, like, at best, 40 seconds at the cost of pissing off 100 people.  And try to enjoy, even though it's kind of impossible, those moments when you are screaming at yourself to get high.  Enjoy those dark moments, the memories of what you've done to try to become who you want to be, because it's all part of your unique journey through life. Also, listen to The Foo Fighters, Alan Watts, and your heart.   And stop getting high. You don't even fucking like it."

Hoping for the best for you, but I honestly can see this still going pretty bad for you.  Life is about making your own decisions.  ""Deciding to be better"" is an initiative that you, yourself, have to take.    With that in mind, check out /r/WWOOF.  I think it would be a great personality for you to not only help out, but to also learn more about yourself."

DecidingToBeBetter,34dnmz,snowlune,6,Thu Apr 30 11:36:05 2015 UTC,"This is a horrible idea.   To make a good informed decision you should look into what industry skills you have and move to an area of that industry. If you do not have a real resume, then your best bet would to go off which state has the lowest rates of unemployment. Which would be Wisconsin.   You do not want to go to Florida if you are looking for a lifestyle change. Florida is heavily reliant on ""ghetto"" culture and you will find yourself trying to escape the same problems either way, on top of it employment isn't the best in Florida unless you have a tech or cooperate management job.   Remaining in Michigan and moving to another city wouldn't be bad, with an unemployment rate of 5.6% However looking to what exactly gets you a  job in Michigan is really, engineering. I would recommending schooling far more than moving. With homelessness and low cost of living you could attend college using Pell Grants and possibly state grant and work study if you don't move out of state to start over, but maybe school was just not your thing, I'm not sure. http://www.michiganbusiness.org/grow/industries/  If you are looking into low cost of living and dont mind agriculture than Indiana would be your best bet. It is considered one of the lowest cost of living states. http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/09/07/wscs-10-least-expensive-states/15075077/  Most importantly you need to learn HOW to make good decisions. What works for you? You have the internet at your fingertips to research and study literally everything, you are at rock bottom with no where to go but up. So where do you want to go? What do you value? What do you absolutely NOT want?  P.S. hold onto your car, until you are financially stable enough that you could purchase a new one cash. Getting out of homelessness is a long and hard road and that car can be the difference between life and death. Dont assume just because you have an apartment the threat of homelessness has gone, its not gone until you are out of poverty, and that takes a very long time.  http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm"

I haven't been able to get my financial aid because my adoptive parent hates me and refuses to give me the information needed for it. The community college I attended is incompetent as well and lost important documents that made me miss a semester. I'm already paying back my student loans sadly. I tried filing independently but I don't have access to the documents needed to do so. Hell I can't even donate blood because I don't have some documents showing that I'm adopted.   I came up with this idea because I figured it'd be a nice social experiment and could help in the long run. I honestly don't know where to begin to get my life on track but leaving Michigan just seems like a good start.  I've tried learning a skill and using it when I made my first mobile app. Invested money heavily into it, and I failed.   I tried writing a book and so far I've only sold 7 copies after I invested a ton of hours into it.  I've tried school. I've tried applying to jobs. There's simply just not much out there there.   I just want a fresh start more than anything..."
DecidingToBeBetter,34dnmz,spider_saint,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:37:11 2015 UTC,"As someone who was also homeless, due to my biological parents hate me, I totally get where you are coming from. I recommend trying to deal with your documentation as soon as possible, but I'm unsure of your age and weather you are considered an independent adult yet. If you are over 23 you should be able to call around to get whatever documents you need. This should be priority #1 in your life, as the issue will only get worse as you age. Change your name if need be. Don't put it off. The last thing you need is for your asshole parents to call CPS on you in the future and have your kids taken away because some documents were missing and you are therefore not allowed to have them in your house or whatever bureaucratic crap happens. Check out /r/raisedbynarcissists for horror stories on how badly that can go for you, then go deal with that problem.  While I understand where you are coming from, understand that this wont be a social experiment. Reddit and people are pretty predictable when it comes to polls like this. People will vote for crap like ""OH, Florida sounds nice it has beaches"" and honestly, if that's the kind of forethought that you need in your life choices, than empower yourself and make that choice. The whole point of this subreddit is that self-empowerment. Failure is OKAY. Heck, you said yourself the only way is up, so why not make your choices be the ones that lift you up? Can you imagine how good that would feel?  Next up, you've learned form 2 entrepreneurial efforts that you are not so great at entrepreneurship. Get the idea out of your head that you need to make some big career move like ""I'm going to be a writer"" or whatever crap and simply straight up make a list. I HATE cold weather. (Okay well Wisconsin is probably out) Or I learn with my hands (farming with WWOOF might be good for you)  You are not in the position to decide on a  career, you need to work on you first. Find out who you are, present that, make a choice from that position. Don't  know who you are? Congrats, you and everyone else! But you have a great chance right now to figure that out, and it won't be done by having others make your choices for you. Think of it like a back brace. People where a back brace for extra support, but if you wear one all the time it actual ends up hurting you, why? Because you never strengthened that muscle in the first place. I have no issues with using reddit to help you figure you out, but letting them make the choice is unwise from a personal development sort of view."

Now think of a being—present, past, mythical, or actual; per- son, pet, or even stuffed animal—that you can imagine having warm affection for you.  Picture this being in your mind, and see their warmth, kindness, and compassion.  Imagine their affection and let it envelop you.

Of course we all do it, but it doesn't serve us or make improvement rewarding, because if you're always comparing, then you will never be satisfied. We should compare to OURSELVES and where we used to be, not to others. An easy example would be weight loss, perhaps. There will always be someone thinner or with a more perfect body. You will ALWAYS fall short and always feel disappointed, unless you step back and look at YOUR OWN progress rather than someone else's.   It's deciding to be ""better,"" not deciding to be the ""best"" or deciding to be ""truly happy."" There is no best or truly happy. It's all relative. There is only better than before."
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,Karunamon,2,Wed Apr 29 17:18:56 2015 UTC,"I think I take the opposite view on this - absent a comparison, you don't have any way to objectively measure your own behavior. ""Become a better programmer"" is an example - better, relative to what? How do you measure improvement without something to measure against?  Satisfaction is one thing, but satisfaction also has the uncanny ability to make one become complacent.  Dissatisfaction need not necessarily include unhappiness."

There may be a 'lesser' you in the past, or a 'better' you in the future but you can't compare time.   There is no standard person that we measure people against. We only do that with ideals which is a future prospect. You can't compare a present self against a future ideal.

DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,george137,2,Wed Apr 29 21:39:29 2015 UTC,"But that's looking backwards, not forwards. ""How much I've progressed"" is a heartening thing to see, but it does nothing for determining what you should strive for.  A good goal is specific, measurable, and attainable.  Absent a comparison, you can't measure a goal. Example: ""Get twice as good at cooking as I am right now"".  How do you quantify ""twice as good"" and ""where you are right now"" without an external relation? Twice as good as what? Where are you actually right now?  ""I want to be as good a chef as Gordon Ramsay"" isn't very good either, but from there, we can break it down. We can look at what that he knows and go from there. You can study his techniques, dishes, business practices, personality (okay, maybe not that one :3), and so forth.  ""I want to learn how to make Beef Wellington like Gordon Ramsay in a few weeks"" is better. Enough of those kind of goals and you'll pick up enough of the other things along the way that maybe, you just might become as good a chef as him, at least to your own reckoning.  The hate on comparison is misaimed, I think. The problem isn't with comparing yourself per se, the problem is with setting unmeasurable and unattainable goals based on those comparisons."
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,george137,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:42:11 2015 UTC,"Writing down your goal and tracking what you do is probably the most important thing you can do because above anything it keeps you honest. You can't deny that you have a goal and your trying to do it.   Your right if your not specific in your goal then your not going to to get anywhere. If you don't know exactly what your end goal is you still need to try something. You should be writing this down some where because as you work on it you will notice things. You'll come up with new ideas and you'll notice patterns. From these ideas and patterns you can tell which direction you should be going because you'll notice what works and what doesn't. Which will lead you to be able to better define your goal!  Once you've been able to define your goal. Then you need to keep track of the things you do for the same reasons as above. Completing a goal is not linear. You'll have ups and downs and you want to track what did work and what didn't. This way you can take what you did in the past that did work modify it a little bit and replicate it and do it again and that will move you closer to your goal.   Lets go back to your cooking example. If I was going to learn to cook and I had no idea how to cook. I'd start out by stating my goal as ""I want to get good at cooking"". Then I would cook a number of things that I would want to cook. Then I would take a look at my goal and then redefine it again. To something like ""I want to get so good at cooking that I don't eat out anymore"" Then I would go about figuring out how to do that. Next step would be to redefine it  again ""I want to get so good at cooking that I enjoy my food over restaurant food"" and go about doing that. The point is as I get better at cooking the more defined my goal becomes and the better I get a cooking. And that's exactly how sweetgoals helps me."

I see comparison as a ""roof""  of what is possible. Sure you can set the goal of breaking the roof too.  But you must first see what is being done at the comparative level."
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,kkristynn,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:09:52 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. I think that the people who really want to improve will do it because they want to get better at something not because there is someone else out there who does it better.
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,PervyLemming,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"But how will you know you need to improve if you have never seen better. For example... Say you think you are good at cooking eggs. You think you are quite good at it. You are content because you don't know there's a small Chinese boy out there practising cooking eggs 300 times a day.  He strives to be the best God damn egg cook the world has seen.   Now until you met the guy or heard about him or tasted his out-of-this-world eggs,  you were fairly content with your own egg ability.  Post tasting his eggs, you now know there's so much more you could do.  Perhaps you will never make it to his level, but it may spur you on to Improve your own cooking because now you are aware there is a new level."
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,PervyLemming,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:12:19 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on the skill you are trying to improve. Let's say you're a welder and you just welded some car parts together and after the owner leaves and  welding breaks then you know that you need to improve your skills. This can be applied to the egg cooking as well. If u cook someone eggs and they tell you they had better ones than u know you need to improve.   The real question is when do you stop trying to improve. You become the best egg cooker but you're not perfect because there is no such thing as perfect. So so you stop trying to improve because you are the best at it?   This got a bit derailed. I have no idea what I'm talking about and trying to prove :D
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,PervyLemming,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:26:44 2015 UTC,Haha I think you are proving my point. Glad it clicked.
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,PervyLemming,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:33:59 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but I guess there are different ways of looking at this.  Personally, if I was this egg guy and I thought I was really good and then I tasted the best eggs, I would probably get discouraged by the thought that my eggs would never be that good and I may give up on my egg quest entirely.   Not exactly proud to admit that, but that's how my brain works a lot of the time.   However, if I were to compare my very first egg attempt to my latest and see that there was noticeable improvement, I would prove to myself that change and betterment IS actually possible, and if I got better from then, I can surely get better from now - motivating me to try! That was the point I was trying to illustrate in my comment above.  So, actually, these things can go hand in hand. If you're a person like me who leans toward negative self talk rather than embracing a competitive spirit, then I would suggest you stop comparing yourself to others and reflect on your own personal growth and success for motivation."
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,chattymcgee,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"I would of thought someone who thinks fairly negatively doesn't necessarily looks for solutions but simply looks for excuses.   The whole negative narrative of... I'm not good enough... Doesn't come with a side of ""but I can be better"".   I agree with the point about going from the first egg to the last egg and the difference being reason for celebration, but I still contend that beyond learning not to break the eggs and spill it on the floor, what improvement would you ever strive for if you are satisfied with the first couple of attempts and are certain (failing a comparison)  you have pretty good egg making skills?"

DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,LeCaptainInsano,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:58:04 2015 UTC,"Critical thought is about addressing the negative. It is not the same as negative thought. We use critical and negative interchangeably sometimes when we shouldn't.  If you're satisfied with your eggs, you won't improve them. But I think if the only reason you pursue making eggs is that they be tastier, you won't improve them either because you'll never be satisfied.  But if you make eggs because you love the way they look and feel and taste and the idea of making one thing into an endless number of dishes over and over is your idea of heaven and you want to share in the delight of others who love eggs and maybe you like chickens a little bit because it's not just about the eggs... Then you might have something because nothing compares to that even if the eggs don't turn out."
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,idamayer,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:40:32 2015 UTC,"I think you are onto something here. I feel like this is heading towards the 10,000 hour rule Territory. Where by complete obsession and a tonne of practice leads to mastery. And agree that is the methodology and reasoning behind it.   But ultimately it doesn't answer the fundamental question of... Why should I improve?   It isn't really possible to know that runny, disgusting off green eggs are not the colour and texture they should be... Without a comparison of better eggs."
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,idamayer,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:14:05 2015 UTC,"There is no rule of mastery or of anything really. Anything we measure is subject to error, misinterpretation and spectrums of reality. There is however a point where your reason can cloud your intuition.  Should implies a moral imperative and there isn't one. You can improve if you want to, if you feel like it. Most people want to improve. People who can't beyond a certain point, we call them disabled because we value the outcome more than the intent and we devalue their contribution. It doesn't diminish their desire to improve. People who don't want to contribute in a normative fashion, we label them with mental illness because the outcome of their efforts is not aligned with our values and we misunderstand their intent. So we see some people as unable to make good eggs and others as making bad eggs on purpose to inflate our own valuation of competence and contribution. There are lots of words for this when someone does it to us: self centered, petty, narrow minded, fussy, cynical. But as a society we redeem it and call it competition.  I know bad eggs are bad because I can sense that they are. They smell bad, taste bad and feel bad on my mouth. The subjectivity of experience overwhelms the outcome so we judge good/bad. But if I sense the intent of the egg cooker to be good it redeems the experience even if the outcome is not ideal. When people talk about bad service it is rarely about pure incompetence but more out of a feeling that the server did not CARE.  Focusing on learning the rules, methodology, reason of everything can prevent people from just doing it and deciding by their own experience what the value of things are, in truth. Learning by study of process and measurement of outcomes alienates us from the very thing we want to accomplish. The improvement lies in between the methodology and the metrics and exists completely without both. Methodology and metrics can't exist without what happens in between which makes them pretty irrelevant."
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,idamayer,1 point,Fri May 1 01:24:18 2015 UTC,"You know you need to improve because you desire it.  The desire to improve your eggs would still exist without tasting the best eggs. That kids who cooks 300 eggs a day is not driven because they have tasted all the best eggs in the world and therefore know the best their eggs can taste. They cooked 300 eggs because they wanted to, loved it or perhaps, say, for economic reasons HAD to.  The decision was not to improve, it was merely between doing it and not doing it."
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,dragonsmke,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:29:59 2015 UTC,"But he may not have improved if he needed to do it for economic reasons. Think of a minimum wage burger flipper. Do you think after flipping 5000 burgers they are any more inclined to care about the quality of the food? If it's passable and there were no complaints most of the time, there is no motivation to improve... Even if you do 300 eggs or burgers a day."
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,FlyingNarwhal,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:15:43 2015 UTC,"The reason we 'look' to improve is because seeing the work of others and or even the outcome of our own work is a 'looking outward'. Our focus is shifted to things outside our control.  If we focus on the work, our thought process and joy, that stays internal, you control it. Stay there. Aim for nothing. Just pursue the experience of the work and that will 'improve you'. If your only pursuit is to do better to please your ego, you might be working on the wrong thing. Ultimately if your aim is only to improve, the only thing you will improve is your ego."
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,dragonsmke,6,Thu Apr 30 00:10:57 2015 UTC,"I consider myself at what you are calling point y, but it didn't come about by getting anywhere.  The difference between point x and point y is that at x you need certain things to be happy, and at point y you are happy, and you only want things.  I have recently started working out and dieting.  I want to be healthier and I would like more positive attention from women.  However, I am not waiting for anything, there is no need, there is no place I am trying to get to where I think things will be ""better.""  I have goals set, but these are tools to measure the process I am using.  They are not reflective of my worth.  I don't expect to be happier when I am at my goal weight.  I do expect my clothes to fit better.  I do expect to sleep better and have more energy.  At point x we believe that there is something wrong with us, and that external things will prove our worth, to ourselves and to others.  At point y I believe that there is nothing wrong with me, that my worth is intrinsic, and that external things only alter the quality of my life.  I would like a relationship to add to my life, not to prove that I'm worthy, or attractive, or ""a man,"" or whatever other validation people seek from relationships.  So, I aim for the mythical point z.  I want to fulfill my potential and I recognize that I will seek higher and higher mountains to climb.  But I'm happy today because all the external things don't matter. I got to point y, and it was not what I expected it to be."
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,animalmind,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:55:48 2015 UTC,Good succinct answer. So you feel you truly came from a point if despair or pain to a point now where you feel totally comfortable with yourself and anything extra is a bonus?
DecidingToBeBetter,349xf6,FlyingNarwhal,4,Wed Apr 29 17:04:28 2015 UTC,"In 2000 I was depressed and overwhelmed by my ""failures"" in life even though I was objectively successful.  I was on the edges of suicidal.  Then I started getting treatment for the depression I didn't know I had.  The meds made a difference, solving maybe 30% of the negativity.  But most of it came from how I thought about things, about my lack of perspective on what really mattered.  So I started working on that, and it got better and better.  Lots of books, lots of self exploration, some therapy.  I put in the work of getting better.  Then a few of years ago I was diagnosed with cancer, and dealing with that blew out the last vestiges of bullshit left in my mind.  That is not to say I don't have any negative thoughts or feelings.  But, instead of being consumed by them I immediately isolate them and try to figure out where they are coming from.  When I look into the mirror and I see an overweight man, I think ""okay, what can I do to improve this?"" instead of ""I am awful, what is wrong with me?""  If I am trying to be cleaner, and a certain habit isn't sticking I think ""how can I make this better?"" instead of ""I am a dirty lazy slob.""  I had the ""good fortune"" of having to stare my own mortality in the face.  I remember the night before surgery I wrote out all my online passwords in case I died the next day.  After going through that, how much can little things possibly bother me?    I think the cancer gave me a shortcut, but I think it's possible to get here otherwise.  It may have taken me another ten years though.    This really is a much more pleasant way to live."

Perhaps not consciously but on a subconscious level you become aware that you could be weeded out of existence, none of the minor shit matters, you have no time to waste etc. And looking around at others who are squabbling over the temperature of their milk in their Cafe late you probably realise what you need to do to improve."

It's actions that define who we are. You have 1440 minutes every day to be alive and awake. If you can't spare one to do 20 push ups or a couple pull ups it' no ones fault but you.

DecidingToBeBetter,345hd3,kylesbagels,5,Tue Apr 28 19:39:44 2015 UTC,"Youre probably wondering why this is downvoted- it might not be the pessimism.  Lifting weights is perfectly fine for your joints if done with proper form. Mobility issues caused by muscular imbalances will wreak havoc on joints and put you at a huge risk for injury.   Not squatting to at least parallel, for example, wont successfully activate your glutes and hammies, causing the quads to overpower everything in your legs and putting loads of tension on the knees."

There's a balance between kicking your own ass into gear, and driving it into the ground, you're a person, you're worth something.   I'm a slow learner    I used to think like that. You know what actually makes for a better learner? Learning. As a personal example, I've been studying for a certification I want recently, and I've been surprised at how much better my memory has gotten, just because I'm forcing myself to use it. You can do it if you put your mind to it.   Anyways what are my options?    Firstly, get your dad, sit down at a table, and talk to him. Tell him he's right (I'm not saying he is or isn't, however agreeing with him will remove him from the same defensive stance) agree terms, if this is all to do with you not studying, ask for help.   Tell him you want to be better, but you need some help becoming the person you want to be. At this stage, that might mean agreeing to spend x amount of time a day looking for work, discuss your options.  Above all, I really hope it all works out for you."

Jobs are plentiful right now, so you have absolutely no excuse.  Go to any Best Buy, Yogurt Shop, Subway, McDonalds... ANYWHERE.  Everyone is hiring.  Then, the moment you get the job, start looking for rooms to rent in the paper. They should be very reasonable, and it will be an avenue for you to meet new people. Probably people that are in the same station in life you are.   You can then work together with your new acquaintances to learn how to be better in general IF you want to.

Make sure it's close to work or near public transportation so when your car inevitably breaks down, you miss the bus, etc you can still make it to work.  3) Never call home and ask for anything.

DecidingToBeBetter,345hd3,Fuquawi,8,Tue Apr 28 16:59:57 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of suggestions in this thread for tangible actions to take. Start exercising more, sell your gaming stuff, get a job, etc. I won't say this is bad advice, but it's only part of the full picture.   I'm reading a lot of negative self talk here. While it's understandable you feel like shit in your situation, that sort of thing isn't going to help.   When you say ""I'm a lazy piece of shit"" or ""I'm a whiny bitch"" what you're doing is subconsciously creating belief systems around that. You're training your mind to believe those things.   Then, when you do try and make a real change in your life, you're going to fight against not only your habits, but your ingrained beliefs as well.   Ever heard of the phrase fake it 'till you make it? It's true with just about everything.   The first step toward changing and deciding to be better is to believe you can actually be better. And if you're telling yourself you're a lazy piece of shit, you'll have a hard time believing you're actually worth anything and can be better.   So that's where I'd start. Believe you can actually be better.   Find some quotes with which you resonate, and read them often. These are your bible. Post 'em around your room. Here's my desk, for reference: http://imgur.com/azZ3hQT  Read them out loud. Even if you feel ridiculous doing so. Hearing them out loud can help make them more tangible.   Here's a good source for thought-provoking quotes if you use Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-entrepreneur-star/bljnhgkajocmhlflgefahihojeajhjji?hl=en  So why should you listen to me? I'm certainly not the peak of productivity. But I'm far better than I used to be, and all this helped."

Either way your attention is oriented almost entirely to internet sensory and memetic phenomena so you can't pay attention to the real world. It's not that you're a piece of shit, but rather, your brain is broken. This condition sucks and the result will be a lot of anhedonia while you reorient you dopaminergic system to sources of happiness other than the internet. Fortunately you are very neuroplastic, expect life to suck for awhile while you reorient, then slowly find new sources of satisfaction.  The longer you go without masturbation the more your testosterone will increase until you are no longer so shy.

Huh. Almost like, oh, I don't know, someone tore down your personality and built it back up again systematically.    We are obsessed unto obsequiousness about the military in this country. It does not have to be that way. We have been at war almost constantly for our entire history -- and rarely for good reason. I strongly believe it takes away much, much more than it gives.   Every time you see some kind of media figure fellating ""our troops,"" or dollars wasted on weapons that don't work, or costly flyovers at football games, remember this is a choice. Why do we do never question those resources? Why not art? Why not housing, or hunger? Or education?   Have you thought about why the military has become an employer of resort in the last two decades (and, yes, it has - standards for intelligence and mental stability are significantly lower)? Who is rich as a result? Where have jobs dried up since Reagan? (The same billionaires funding the Republicans? The Heartland, where there is a stronger military tradition?)  I didn't put forth anywhere that you were interested in being a ""baby killer,"" but again, interesting that you react that strongly. What I would say is that you may not have made a very good decision for yourself. Fact remains, in the Big Picture, the primary purpose of a soldier is to kill. How anyone could deny that is beyond me.   Sadly and unfairly, vets have an enormously hard time transitioning back to real life, and they have worse-than-average rates of employment, to the point where we need government programs to help them get jobs, and the plague of suicides and PTSD that we don't know what to do with. I happen to think it's a big deal that other mother's sons and daughters come back from service unable to feel love. Our worship of war has ruined far more lives than it has helped."

So, what I understand from your post is that you are more or less stable. You kind of know where you are and what to do (exercise, meditation). Its not perfect, but allright. Manageable.  The one problem right now, the one thing in your mind that pulls you down is the job thing. If thats true so far, then we have a lot in common right now. (tl;dr Im 28, did school, some college, never finished, had jobs, paid my bills, got chewed up a bit by those jobs and life, fell down a bit, got help from parents, am standing now but unemployed and not sure where to go next).  Here is what I figured out. You gotta define for yourself when you have ""made it"". Is that when you are rich? Is that when your parents are happy? Is that when you are a surgeon/architect/actor? Is that when you are the best at something? Maybe your job isnt an important part of that. Maybe its just so you have some money.   I dont know my passion, I dont know if I really have one. I think for me its not about to find that and make it my job. Its not necessary. I know I want to pay my bills, I want to have time and energy for spirituality/meditation, I want to live happy&healthy. If on most days Im able to do my job, chores and enjoy the sunshine or some company, then I made it.  And what does that mean for my career? I guess for now that means that my job should pay the bills and mustnt drain to much of my energy. So, no nightshifts, no emotional stress (children, special needs, ect) and no shady stuff like selling something that i know is worthless.

Learning a guitar (or piano), however, has a lot of skills that easily translate onto other instruments. If you learn guitar, picking up a ukulele or mandolin, or even sitting at a piano will come a lot more naturally and it will only take you an hour to figure the instrument out. learning a Ukelele, and then trying to learn a new instrument would be a lot harder. Id recommend the guitar just because free resources for it are infinitely larger online than for the ukelele and a guitar will teach you a lot more about music concepts than a ukelele. (IMO)"
DecidingToBeBetter,344whe,dwolfy,15,Tue Apr 28 18:53:33 2015 UTC,Guitar is easy to learn most popular songs once you get used to the physical side of playing and holding down the strings. In a year or two you can play most common riffs and some solos. I've been playing about ten years having not played much last few years and can still pick up and play most songs and used the internet to learn. Nowadays you have YouTube to help as well. Sure you may not be able to play any Steve vai for a while (but you'd be surprised what you can do with a metronome and patience) but most popular rock metal pop and indie will not be a problem after a year if you are consistent

I learned how to play entirely from it,  it's really effective and with a great community which makes a lot of songs available via mods.  Its took me a year to be able to play most things I tried"
DecidingToBeBetter,344whe,Adfero,2,Tue Apr 28 10:51:05 2015 UTC,I'm thinking about getting that. How advanced does it go?
DecidingToBeBetter,344whe,jumbohumbo,2,Tue Apr 28 11:04:29 2015 UTC,"Its pretty advanced compared to the original game.  It's able to pick up palm muting,  finger muting,  finger tapping and so on.   It has a teaching mode where is teaches you different styles and techniques.  You also have the guitarcade which has a bunch of modes where you can get used to moving about the guitar while playing mini games. And finally the main 'learn a song' mode where you can learn how to play various songs.  The game moves forward only once it is satisfied that you are understanding what notes to press and how.  It will then add in another note or two and see how you react.  If you are  getting it then it will update the rest of the song with that change.   if you don't it goes back down until you are a bit more confident. Eventually after many replays you will be playing the song as its played.  And with the more often you get play particular section perfectly,  it will start making the notes disappear.  Making you rely on your memory.  If you mess up it will fade them back in for a bit.    try and get the pc edition if you are able to run it.  There is a website where people share songs they have tabbed themselves.  There is pretty much anything you can think of there.  And if there isn't you can request it.  Its called customs forge"
DecidingToBeBetter,344whe,Adfero,3,Tue Apr 28 12:05:32 2015 UTC,"I'm learning guitar right now and once you build some calluses on your fingers and can play and switch between open chords, it does get easier...at least to the point where you can enjoy playing a lot more.  Better yet, it has kind of retaught me how to learn things.  College was easy for me, I never learned how to learn if that makes sense.  I just understood everything pretty quickly or was able to understand enough to BS through a test or homework.  Going into the ""real world"" I didn't fully comprehend the struggle to learn something that doesn't take less than a day to learn.  I would get frustrated that I didn't pick up on something right away and quit.  My 20's were littered with bad examples of this.  Playing guitar is super frustrating at times....I can go 1-2 weeks and feel like I'm not improving at all or I'll never pick up the concept I've been practicing forever, and then one day it just kind of clicks and you start to understand that all the frustration was worth it because it allowed your body and mind to master the concept.  Crazy as it sounds, I find myself tackling more difficult projects outside of guitar playing...it has really helped my motivation in general."

I bought my first harmonica back in October 2012, I believe. While my skill thus far isn't anywhere near what you might expect, I enjoy playing it (when I do get the chance from time to time).   Like said, it's small so it's very portable. Have to go on a trip and would like to keep practicing? All you need is your pocket. No batteries required like the keyboard I have. Best of all, it's very easy to teach yourself how to play. There are TONS of lessons on Youtube, and even without those, a lot of songs are easy to learn to play as there are tabs abound.  Plus, they're (generally) pretty cheap. I bought mine on Amazon for $35."

DecidingToBeBetter,344whe,anonymau5,10,Tue Apr 28 11:34:10 2015 UTC,"Hey man!  Musician here with ten years of experience and I play 7 instruments (details).  Not trying to be like ""here comes the right answer!"" just saying my credentials.  In my experience, the ""easiest"" would be sound itself (as in running the board and being the sound guy).  It takes a while to develop an ear for it, but it's 100% science.  Nobody can tell you you're doing it wrong because it's not debatable.  I mean, it's debatable how you prefer to mix things (I prefer to have the vocals sit slightly higher in the mix so they stick out more but most bands I work with prefer to have the vocals on the same level as everyone else), but you can't really say ""oh, it sounds tinny"" (legit word) ""because the lows are too high"" because science says you're a goddamn retard and it's because the mids are too low.  (Semantics kicking in in my head in 3...2...).  Anyways, my point is that while being able to be good at it (to hear a sound, identify it, and correct it) takes time, it's also easiest because it's an exact science.  Best instrument?  Best in terms of usefulness, piano hands down.  It's the most versatile and because of the key structure it will give you a visual map of every single music theory you will ever possibly need.  It has the widest range of any instrument and once you start delving into synthesizers it lays the groundwork.  In fact, it lays the foundation for pretty much any instrument.  I would encourage anyone interested in music or sound to at least learn basic piano.  Best in terms of best sounding or most fun?  That's 100% opinion.  I think the drums are the most fun instrument I've ever played, but I think 8 string guitar is probably the best sounding just because of the sheer versatility, especially when coupled with effects processors.  Finally, easiest other than sound.  Bass guitar, hands down.  You can pick up a bass guitar and be ""join a band"" ready in less than a month.  Now if you want to get ""badass"" good, that's gonna take some time and effort.  But you can pick up a show-worthy bass and amp for less than $1000, learn intermediate bass and enough music theory to effectively write and communicate your ideas in less than a month on 1-2 hours of serious practice a day, easily.  As far as lessons, if you're interested in any of the instruments I listed, I'd be happy to offer whatever I can.  I'm pretty rusty on some of them, like violin and piano, but I still remember how to play them properly and will happily offer any resources I have.  Definitely pick something up if you're interested.  Music is my obsession for a reason.  It's so goddamn fun and universal.  Best of luck!"

DecidingToBeBetter,344whe,Theso,2,Tue Apr 28 15:10:56 2015 UTC,"As a hobbyist producer of electronic music, thanks for including mixing and synthesizers! They're quite fun, but I'm skeptical about how ""easy"" they really are... Piano/keyboard is a good suggestion though."
DecidingToBeBetter,344whe,PM_me_guinea_pigs,2,Tue Apr 28 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"I think the hard part comes in when you start getting into the details, like building your own synth sounds.  It's just like guitar.  Anybody can turn it on and pick a preset and jam and maybe even make some music.  But when you start getting serious and go ""I want this specific sound,"" that's when you have to start knowing what you're doing.  The first time I got serious about my guitar tone, the guys at Guitar Center thought I was on crack because I insisted on having a legit rackmount compressor instead of a guitar pedal compressor, but they didn't understand that #1) I'm an expert (or at least ""advanced"") at live sound (started at age 15) so I know exactly what all the knobs do and I know exactly what kind of sound I want out of them, and #2) I know exactly what kind of sound I want.  I can't do two knobs with a preset ratio or gain output.  I needed the hardest ratio I could get.  I needed the most sensitive threshold I could get.  I needed the gain output to be specific.  For the wealth of knowledge I've accumulated, I'm still totally lost as fuck when it comes to building my own synth sounds.  I've got a friend who does EDM and one of these days he's gonna sit down with me and go over in detail what every setting does so I know how to use a synth properly.  I'm pretty excited for it though.  Synth is high on my list of ""instruments I wish I had better mastery over.""  As far as how ""easy"" mixing is, like I said it's easy in the sense that there's an exact science to it.  It takes a while to get good at it and be able to hear a sound and know automatically how to correct it or tweak it, but it's not like guitar where you go ""am I doing this right?  Well technically there's no right or wrong..."" (to an extent I mean, obviously there are a few hard do's and don'ts).  Even I'm not a total expert.  I knew one guy who could hear a sound and instantly tell you the exact frequency that needed adjusting down to the steepness of the bell curve and exactly how many decibels.  It was like watching fucking Mozart compose a symphony out of thin air.  Gorgeous."
DecidingToBeBetter,344whe,Theso,2,Tue Apr 28 17:07:02 2015 UTC,"Synth programing gets bonkers, especially when you go modular or into VSTs that can do so much stuff. There's some incredible sound design out there in the electronic music scene, and that's definitely the hard part I was speaking of. Timbre options are literally infinite... And then you bring in modulation over time and its an entire new dimension as well. In this way, synths are the most exciting instrument to me. You can have completely control not only over the music you play, but how it sounds too. It feels less ""human"" to some people, but the possibilities for expression are just too great to ignore."
DecidingToBeBetter,344whe,PM_me_guinea_pigs,2,Tue Apr 28 17:20:51 2015 UTC,"Adam Young of Owl City said that's why he was so attracted to electronic music is because the possibilities are so vast.  Nah, when I said it was easy what I meant was that if you can play piano, you already have a solid understanding of how the synth works in the same sense you would any other instrument - you understand the chords, the triads, the scales, etc.  I think every musician should at least learn their scales and chords on piano so they can carry that knowledge and understanding on to the next instrument.  That's really why I suggested piano as the ""best"" instrument."
DecidingToBeBetter,344whe,Theso,2,Tue Apr 28 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you there. Piano is pretty valuable. Most synths use a piano keyboard as an interface, so it carries over. And yes, it's wonderful for learning theory. It's my preferred way to visualize it all."

If you're trying to play Jazz, prog, or specific people (Lee, Martini, Protest the Hero), then it'll take longer and more dedication (which I noted). But you can absolutely pick up a bass and be good enough to hold a solid rhythm and play competently within a month if you practice. You may not be doing blazing solos or super funky grooves but you can easily do passing notes, most intermediate rhythms, and basic scales.  Bass is not as hard as we bass players like to pretend it is until you get into the super advanced stuff like the people I listed."
DecidingToBeBetter,344whe,PM_me_guinea_pigs,2,Wed Apr 29 15:09:10 2015 UTC,"I can tell the difference.  But that doesn't make what I said untrue.  I've seen people pick up a guitar and be pro-quality players in literally a year.  I've seen people pick up piano and be playing symphony-level pieces in six months.  It's all about what you put into it.  Is he gonna be ""band ready"" if he picks up a bass and plays My Chemical Romance for thirty minutes a night?  Fuck no.  But if he turns off the TV and sits down with a bass and proper instructional material and puts in a solid hour or two of practice every night, he can absolutely be band ready in a month.  Not to mention it depends on what you're playing.  Don't forget that there's different styles of music.  They're not all equally difficult or easy.  I specifically made that point.  Does he want to be in a punk band?  A month is generous.  Does he want to be in a Rush cover band?  A month is doable if he's practicing the equivalent of a full time job.  Congratulations on playing bass for 20 years.  Stop being an elitist and stop twisting my words.  Go back to your cover band."

A musical instrument isn't something you play with your hands, you play it with your soul. Even if you find an instrument where you press three buttons and a song comes out, you won't pick up the habit and will ditch it. You have to find which one you enjoy the most, not which one is easiest. This gives you the drive to actually play it rather than some stranger telling you what to play.

It's set up in scales, and all you really have to do is learn triangles and boxes. Plus, once you've learned a song in one key, you can just move the same pattern up or down 4 strings and play the exact same song in another key, up to 4 or 5 different keys.

I forgot about things that I loved, people I cared about other than him, and really I felt that I forgot who I really was. I didn't realize when I finally ended it with him that I had put my own goals and priorities off for so long, that it really took a negative toll on how I dealt with stress/pressure/deadlines. I had to relearn the things that made me happy and I felt like I was playing ""catch up"" with others that have been focusing on themselves the whole time in the same field. You just kind of have to take it day by day.  Your situation may not have the same context, but I know exactly how you feel. Some days, you will feel really confident in your abilities. Other days, you might be getting a little too down on yourself. But trust me, letting those emotions of guilt or resentment towards yourself get the better of you will only keep you from progressing more. When you feel like distractions are getting a little too overwhelming, stop what you are doing. Think of all the ways it's going to effect you negatively if you continue to be distracted. But also, think of how good it is going to feel when you are on time with work and studying. You can still make leisure time for yourself, but just make sure it's when you have more important things out of the way first. I still struggle with this, and it can take a lot of willpower at times, but it will get better.

None of this stuff is easy, it just takes time and practice. Organization and discipline. It's a lot harder in practice than it sounds, but I believe in you. Even the fact that you are aware of issues you may be having is a good sign, a lot of people just accept that they are having a difficult time as a sign they are gonna fail. That is absolutely not true. You just have to keep pushing when it things seem tough, and when you can, ask for help. There are a lot of great resources out there now, especially for programming, and people eager to help. Don't ever get down on yourself if you need help or if you make mistakes. It's all part of learning, and being aware of it correcting yourself means it's not likely to happen again. But...practice practice practice!

Keeping positive vibes and people around you is definitely a necessity, starting with the most important person of all, yourself ;)  Other thought came to mind about the ""going very slow"" thing. If and when you have such thoughts, just ask yourself what's the better way then? Stopping alltogether?

Yes this came from a feeling of discouragement, and one of the most powerful things I ever learned but manage to forget in dark times is I cant escape myself. So let me be here now and start from here, not mourn how far away I am from there. Starting from here will probably mean observable tiny achievements. You're right, I can only go forward, no matter how slowly. Eek. I feel more vibrant today, every day is a struggle but as far as mental and emotional practice goes, I think I'm making progress...tiny progress and that's what's important.

But don't STOP making those steps.   As a general goal, I try to say - if I'm changing SMALL things, I want to change those small things frequently.  What I mean is - if I set a small goal - wake up 5 minutes earlier - it's not going to be a 3 month goal.  It's going to be a 1 week goal.  Then I change another small thing.  That way the 1 change might not be large but over the course of say, 6 months, I've made LOTS of small changes that cumulative in a big change.  Conversely, if I make a large goal - lose 25 lbs - it's going to be a big goal I'm going to focus a lot of energy on it.  At the end of 6 months I've only progressed in a large way on one goal.  Either way, both scenarios saw me make a LARGE change - either in 1 chunk or spread over several small bites."

DecidingToBeBetter,342p9q,noviakaunt,9,Mon Apr 27 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"I'm particularly fond of the ""becoming a tourist in your own city"" technique.  Basically, take some time out to see your own city with new eyes. If you don't know where to start, then as soon as you have the time, take a stroll through downtown. Usually, you know exactly where you are headed. You get in, out, home. This time you don't.  Instead, try to take notice of every shop, restaurant, pub, bar and kiosk that you pass. What are they? What's special about them? Why do they exist? Become interested in the things you see everyday but never notice. Try out what you haven't tried before.  I recently discovered that my town has two luxury wine shops with monthly tastings. I went to my first tasting. It wasn't the most mindblowing experience ever, but it certainly fills up my life with little experiences like that.  It can also be going down little side roads you've never seen before - I've found a ton of good restaurants and clothing stores that way. Or try finding new spots outside - like a hill with a nice view or a quiet sunny spot next to a river. Go places where people normally don't go."

Wandering is good."

Not only will you know all the exact places to go for any situation, you'll also start to take notice of little events going on. Wine tastings, conferences, after-hour courses, dance classes, you name it.  Now that I'm in a bigger city, I can sort of pick and choose what sounds better, but when I used to be in a smaller town, I'd just set a couple of bucks aside each month to participate in anything at all. That definitely creates a spike in the ""interesting"" factor in your life, when each week, when somebody asks you what you've been up to lately, you can start going: ""well, Tuesday I was in a dance class, which was boring as fuck. Thursday I went to hear this author speak. Never heard of him, but he had a really interesting life..."" Etc.  The real mistake most people make is that they try to form an interesting life from their boring houses in their boring neighborhoods, when they could up themselves 200% by just attending a few mediocre events a month and putting themselves in relation to that."

Set yourself a goal of something locally like 'this month I'm going to visit every park in my city' or 'I'm going to eat at every restaurant in my city this year' or something. To be more productive at home, set yourself a time limit on the TV or internet.  I'm not allowed to 'veg out' until 10:00 PM.  I get home from work at about 6:00.  I fill those 4 hours with doing some chores, going to the gym, going on walks, or getting a project or two done around the house. Say 'YES' more often when invited to something.  Let it be known to your social group that you'd like to be invited to things - even if they suspect you wouldn't enjoy it or say yes.   Just some food for thought."

Psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck laid the groundwork for the study of these distortions, and his student David D. Burns continued research on the topic. Most notably, Burns’ 1989 book, The Feeling Good Handbook  presented information on these thought patterns along with a proposal of how to eliminate them.  Cognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately. These thinking patterns often reinforce negative thoughts or emotions.  Cognitive distortions tend to interfere with the way a person perceives an event. Because the way a person feels intervenes with how they think, these distorted thoughts can feed negative emotions and lead an individual affected by cognitive distortions towards an overall negative outlook on the world and consequently a depressive or anxious mental state.

Some little perseverance is needed anyway until rhythm kicks in, and the building-up of the new inertia push oneself forward easier. A good analogy is like in climbing a mountain; it's not how fast and strong one starts, but on moving and stopping as much as needed in the beginning, until the body finds its inner rhythm and one can walk and climb great distances gradually. Somehow this approach works for so many things."

This is not how life works. There are no guarantees, but there are benefits to be drawn from whatever you do. What is going to happen if you fail at something? ""Oh no, I became a better person for nothing..."" ""I can't control it."" Yes you can. You were born a human being.  You probably cash in on 'potential', as if that is something good about you that brings value. Be very wary of this. Your fantasies about success or heroism or whatever are puppet shows you play for the back of your brain to trick it into releasing feel-good chemicals, just for a little bit. You'd probably have trouble stopping that if you tried. Habits are very difficult to change. Once you change them and break them with new habits, it's as hard to change the new ones as it used to be hard to change the old ones.

DecidingToBeBetter,340smc,Broseidon241,1 point,Mon Apr 27 12:50:04 2015 UTC,"""I can't control it."" Yes you can. You were born a human being.   Hi Broseidon, I agree with your sentiment of 'you can do it', it is possible to lose control of a desire or dependency - that's the basis for addiction. I think it's important to acknowledge that some things can not be brought under control by will alone.  For OP - I somewhat share your passion for fast food. Especially when I bummed out after work, and heading home for the night, I love to grab a snack. I have a long ride home and a fast food place right beside my office.   I am starting to do a lot better, but what didn't work for me was just cutting everything comforting to eat out all at once. If you are like me, fast food makes me feel a lot better for the moment, which is a hard thing to kick.   If I can suggest an approach, try gradually stepping away from the habit. To being with, figure where you are at and don't feel ashamed. So if you eat fast food twice a day on average, try not to worry. (That doesn't make you any less of a person, it's just a situation.) Instead just plot a course, and step down in small increments. Go to once a day, plus a snack, for say maybe a week. Then once a day, then once every 2 days, and so on. With that method I personally am down to about once a week. Eventually I will be at once a month, where I intend on staying. (I am not a doctor but the occasional junk food night should be fine and I mean we have to live!).  Best of luck!"

Sometimes people read self-help books and never put them in practice which gives knowledge, but we really need to do it if we want permanent change. If you bought 7 habits of highly effective people, there's a passage that states that changing habits take's 80% of the energy at the beginning so the start really is difficult, the good news is, that it gets better down the road.  Good luck OP"
DecidingToBeBetter,33zjdu,TheCleansingFlame,2,Mon Apr 27 13:41:20 2015 UTC,"Such a great step :) Just remember to keep it low-pressure! I think one good way to go about it (so you don't use up all your will-power at once just to read them all) would be to read one or two chapters at a time and to apply them to your life gradually. I think making little changes actually reaps more rewards than trying to make a million changes at once (the change-my-whole-life-upon-waking-up-tomorrow head trap).   Another thing to help you stick to the advice in the books would be to keep a little journal. You could write down a few of the most important bullet points from each chapter and at the end of each day, assess how well you were able to follow it, the reasons you had certain successes and failures, and small changes you could make so that you can improve more the next day.  Best of luck! Keep us updated!"

Learned helplessness theory is the view that clinical depression and related mental illnesses may result from a perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation.

DecidingToBeBetter,33zicx,normalfag,3,Mon Apr 27 02:24:04 2015 UTC,"I just recently had to teach a friend of mine who grew up in New York City how to drive and she was terrified.  What we did was went to a mall after it had closed and most people had left (usually around an hour after it closes) and just drove around the parking lots and the little road that circles the mall.  There are plenty of streetlights so you'll be able to see everything.  You can go as slow as you want, learn what all of the buttons and stuff do, and relax knowing that nothing bad will happen.  If for some crazy almost impossible thing happens and you do happen to drift off the road, there is no chance of hitting anyone or anything.  It also helps learning how to park, which is probably the most difficult part of driving.  Once you feel comfortable at that, you can move on to back roads during the day with some other cars.  Only when you feel really comfortable will you move onto the highway.  Things to remember... 1) you do you.  If you only feel comfortable going 35 miles an hour in a 50 speed limit thats what you do.  If people are lining up behind you honking their horn just relax, pull over to the side of the road and let them pass.  2) Don't over think anything.  If you come up to a ""Y crossing"" and don't know which way to go at all, just go right.  Right turns are easy and if you made the wrong turn who cares?  You just go back around.  3) Wear your seatbelt, don't let anyone ride in the car with you without it.  Not wearing one is just stupid whether its your first time driving or your Dale Earnhardt Jr. 4) Learn in an automatic before switching to a manual.  Its easier for beginners.  4) Just relax and have fun!  I love driving!  If gas was cheaper or I had more money I'd almost never leave my car.  If you have any other questions let me know!

Go a speed you're comfortable with and most importantly feel in control with. Also, try starting off practicing in the day time, in areas with not a lot of things going on, rural and what not.   Hope this somewhat helps, kinkajow said the majority of it :) Good luck man! You can do it!"

DecidingToBeBetter,33zicx,literallyblack,2,Mon Apr 27 09:00:04 2015 UTC,"Get friends to drive with you instead of parents. My parents tried to teach me, but they would get panicky and were more worried about me hitting something than teaching me to drive, which meant I could only drive on empty suburban streets at 15mph in the middle of the street- and was never pushed to improve. I eventually learned to drive from a very calm friend that had the confidence that I wasn't going to wreck his car. Drive very late at night or on backroads for practice. With your family, drive for nearby errands. Pick 3-5 places in town you need to go regularly and get familiar with that route. Since you know the route so well, there will be no surprising and you can focus on other aspects of driving."

I was pretty scared to drive too, but trust me you will be more comfortable with it the more you drive. I'm been practicing driving for the pass 3 months or so, and one day I got in the car and was just... comfortable. I don't know where all my nervousness went. My mom was in the car with me the day this happened and as she was on the phone with her friend she said ""I guess she just woke up today and was suddenly a good driver"". This literally just happened on Saturday. So trust me you will be more comfortable with time."

It may take some time before you notice any substantial changes but once they start happening you will feel great."

New years was when I decided to stop being skinny and change my diet. I went to the gym 5 days a week and meal prepped for the whole week every week. Now I gained almost 10 pounds in muscle mass while losing belly fat since then. Definitely a confidence boost. I hope you stay on the right path!

DecidingToBeBetter,33yfc1,chattymcgee,2,Mon Apr 27 10:39:12 2015 UTC,"Good for you.  Making the decision is the biggest part of change.  However, your tone scares me a little, so let me offer some advice.   Slow your roll.  I believe that you can completely change your life, but you can't do it overnight.  Write out your goals and prioritize them.  Build a ladder of goals that will get you where you need to go.  You can't change 18 years of habits in 18 minutes.  Plan on 18 months (and even that is hella fast).  Focus on changing one habit until it's effortless, then move on to the next.  If every activity is a battle of willpower you will burn out, so focus your willpower on one goal/habit at a time.  Be patient.  Focus on the man you want to be at 20 or 25, not the man you want to be in 20 minutes. Be prepared to fail repeatedly.  Change is not easy.  Be prepared for when you do something wrong.  Be prepared to forgive yourself, figure out what went wrong, and get back to the plan.  Don't feel like a failure because you went off plan.  That is a chance to learn something.  Don't worry if you make a mistake.  Worry if you make the same mistake twice. Look for role models and find good information.  Losing weight is incredibly simple, eat at a caloric deficit.  That's all.  However, applying that to daily life can be extremely complicated.  What works for one person will not work for another.  Question what you see out there.  If it looks too good to be true, it is.  Excellence takes hard work.  You need to work smarter, AND harder.  Don't just decide to ""eat healthy"" and ""exercise.""  Figure out what that means.  For me it's a thousand calorie deficit a day while trying to maintain .8 g protein/pound of lean body weight.  Exercise is a modified stronglifts 5x5 program, alternated with cardio training on off days.   Don't be afraid to reassess goals and plans and timetables as you go along.  Don't forget you are making these changes to be happier, to have a more fulfilling life.  Be proud of yourself and be happy.  Good luck."

I've been exercising (jogging, weights, hillwalking) pretty much every day for a couple weeks, (compare that to the exact zero I was doing before) but because of the shit food I was eating, it was like pissing in the wind. I guess I reached a turning point and made a decision when I outgrew my jeans and met Hannah (The two events are mutually exclusive)."
DecidingToBeBetter,33zly2,MichaelJCooley,4,Mon Apr 27 02:56:05 2015 UTC,I quit smoking over a year ago. I was a pack a day smoker for 6 years. The only way to do it is cold turkey.   I used twizzlers to deal with the oral fixation and going to movies I wanted to see. Your stuck in the theater and it's a little easier to deal with the cravings  The first three days are the hardest. After that just remember how hard those days were and ask if you really want to do that over again.   How ever hard it is think that every day will be better and if you go back to smoking you'll have to do it all over and it'll be harder.   The app I used is called iQuit. It gives little goals and achievements that kinda make it like a game.   You got this.
DecidingToBeBetter,33zly2,wyndhamheart,3,Mon Apr 27 04:07:36 2015 UTC,I'm a big hookah smoker (4-7 bowls a day) and when I can't smoke due to money or something else it usually helps to just get busy. Also taking a really hot shower but just sit in the heat of your bathroom for a bit it helps sweat out the bad stuff and takes the edge off. Thats helped me when I quit smoking cigs.
DecidingToBeBetter,33zly2,manowar572,2,Mon Apr 27 03:58:37 2015 UTC,"Myself and many of my friends used Allen Carrs Easy Way to Stop Smoking book. It's all about attitude and mindset towards the cravings and, as the title suggests, is it quite easy, I made some notes which I used very little but will post here but consider getting the book as it really does open your mind to a quitting method that will make it easy and something you won't miss, which is also a big part of stopping.   Note: After 9 years of being a non-smoker I was out with a mate having drinks and he was smoking, it was a beautiful summer night so I thought I'd have a smoke as it seemed like a good thing to do....and that was me smoking again, smoked for 3 months then bought the book again and quit like again.   Best of luck  Smoking rules I Know that “I will NEVER smoke a cigarette again” Never mope about not smoking…instead rejoice and never doubt the decision, this is the EASY WAY to quit and the key to success. Stop kidding myself, I can do it…it’s easy Stopping smoking is now the most important thing in my life, right now Realize that I am not giving anything up, but gaining many, many great things. If I Don’t feed my monster and it will die, remember it’s a game and the monster will try many tactics to win. Enjoy the game Cigarettes don’t fill the void, they create it Cigarettes create the symptoms they relieve My body gives us warnings like coughing and dizziness Be free from the slavery of smoking Each day, as I improve I’ll think, ‘isn’t this great, I’m not going to die’ I suffered from the fear of not smoking, I am rid of this fear When I was allowed to smoke, I wished I didn’t smoke, when I couldn’t smoke, I wished I could It was costing me thousands of dollars to ruin my physical health, destroy nerves and confidence, to endure a lifetime of slavery, bad breath, smelly clothes and stained teeth Smoking is a chain reaction, never have ‘just one’ My health is my most valuable asset Smoking does absolutely nothing good for me Enjoy the cravings, see the cravings as death of the monster I have a drug addiction and a disease Re-read Ch’s 15, 29 and 42 if I am ever having any doubts “Just one cigarette” does NOT exist. I am now a non-smoker who will never smoke again Isn’t is just great that I am a non-smoker Never think that I am making a sacrifice by giving up and never wait for the urge to smoke, always rejoice the decision"
DecidingToBeBetter,33zly2,Allyanderson00,2,Mon Apr 27 09:16:29 2015 UTC,I quit nine years ago. Just remember that any nic fit no matter how bad lasts for only a few minutes. If you can last five minutes you can get that much closer to quitting.   Don't go cold turkey tomorrow. You will want to identify when/why you smoke and seek to change your routine at those times. I used to smoke after every meal and did dishes before i crashed. While I was quitting I did the dishes right after eating.  Avoid as many triggers as possible.   I wish you the best of luck. For me the first four days and the third month were the hardest.
DecidingToBeBetter,33zly2,chattymcgee,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:45:19 2015 UTC,"I just stopped vaping this past weekend.  I used to smoke, until I got cancer (actually smoked a little [very little] during treatment as the cigs helped when the chemo nausea got really bad, but don't tell my doctor).  Once chemo was over I switched to e-cigs.  I figured my big problem was the carcinogens, not the nicotine.  But I got to the same place.  I can't have a healthy relationship with nicotine.  It's all or nothing for me.  So, I was thinking about quitting and then my charging pack broke (right after I bought $30 of tanks).  I decided that instead of buying a new charging pack I would just stop.  After about three days the nicotine was out of my system and the ""itch"" in my brain was gone.  I will still occasionally think of smoking when something triggers the habit, but without the chemical component I can just put it out of my mind.  Those three days were actually pretty easy for me, as every time I had a strong craving I asked myself if the craving was worse than chemo.  Obviously it wasn't close, so I knew I could handle the craving.  This approach may not work for you, but try it.  Recognize that the withdrawal only lasts 3 days, and that it isn't really that bad.  It's like mild hunger or thirst.  It's not even pain, it's more like an itch.  Now, like everybody in this world, I'm sure you've been through some pain at some time.  Use that pain as a comparison.  If you survived that, you can easily deal with this itch now.  All you need to do is keep that up for a few days and the cravings will become rare.  If you get one after that, use the same technique.  Good luck."

DecidingToBeBetter,33xcfd,Changingmyshittoday,19,Sun Apr 26 15:23:35 2015 UTC,"Years ago in Maryland when I was nineteen being in your shoes, an old deaf man with a familiar face sat down next to me at the park and asked me if I knew the secret to life.  I didn’t really know what to say; I never really thought about it and I had no clue what the secret was.  I said, ""I don't know.""  He was not kidding because he looked at me with the most serious face I had ever seen and he simply said… ""You"".  Me?  I didn’t know what he meant by that but I guess he could see the confusion on my face because he started to explain what he said. He told me the secret to life was me. Not other people’s lives but mine alone. Not money, not power, not brains.  There wasn’t some huge mystery hidden in the Egyptian temples or written in the scrolls of Greek scholars.  All that life is - is me.  At this point I still wasn’t sure what he was saying, but he went on.  You hold keys to your own life. Keys to love, religion, wealth, power, hope, truth, fame, sorrow. Everything you can think of, but it’s up to you to figure out how to use these keys.  He told me to love with a passion. Love my family, my friends, and my enemies. He told me to find out what religion is to me. Do not join a church because your friends join it, don’t have a faith that is forced upon you, go out and read, study, pray, and find out the truth for yourself. Because until you find out for yourself what the truth is, you’ll never truly have something to believe in.  He told me that a person is not measured by his wealth. For he who has everything and shares nothing will be lonely and meaningless. Wealth creates greed, hate, selfishness, spoiled-ness, and ungratefulness. Measure a man not by the vastness of his wealth, but by the humbleness and giving of his heart. Because to give is to truly receive.  He told me to be humble and give all that I have to those who have nothing and I’ll be rewarded someday beyond my imagination. He explained to me that when times are hard, they can always be harder… When I have lost, others have lost more… And the life that I would sometimes kill to be out of, there will always be someone who would kill to have it.  He told me to learn all that I can in all that I enjoy. He told me to read books to broaden my imagination, write poetry to show my heart, and to pay attention to all forms of life because you can learn from everything and everyone.  He told me that I can learn from those I teach. I am just as able to learn from a 2 year old as I am from a 50 year old with a doctorates degree.  He told me to honor my mother and my father. Because until I have children of my own, I will never know the hardships they faced to give me all that I had, I will never know the countless hours spent trying to make me happy when they were going through their own personal trials and tribulations. Also to love my siblings because they are flesh of my flesh and blood of my blood.  He told me to appreciate life everyday. Close to every 8-10 seconds someone dies. Who’s to say that in the next 8-10 seconds you won’t be the next one? He told me that everyday is a blessing and that I should enjoy it, thank the universe for it, and tell those you love you love them. If you are called away from this world tomorrow, tell everyone you love them today.  He told me that someday I’ll find someone that makes me happy and makes me feel like I’m worth something. He told me to hold on to that person and cherish that person, appreciate that person and hold that person, allow yourself to love that person and let go of petty things.  He told me that no time is worth a stupid argument and never go to bed angry, hurt, or upset. Fight for what you believe, believe in what you know, and know that they were sent to you for a purpose.  He told me to not allow myself to become troubled by those things I cannot change and those things that are out of my hands, let them go and let the universe handle them.  He told me to stop and thank the universe everyday for everything. To stop being selfish and only keep the hope going when I need something or when times are hard. Because 10 times out of 10…the universe's the reason good things happen as well. Stop what I’m doing at least 3 times a day and think about the universe to appreciate everything that the universe has provided.  He told me to be great at who I am and do my best at what I do. Try your hardest everyday and the work you put out will show in the end. Embrace who you are, appreciate who you are, and don’t try to be anything or anyone else. If the universe wanted you to be similar, He would have made you a twin. But you’re an individual, you’re special, and you’re unique. Don’t let anyone or anything change that.  He told me not to judge a book by its cover. People look one way on the outside and can be totally different on the inside. You make fun of people who have flaws when what you need to do is make fun of your own flaws. They have jagged teeth, you have big ears. They have a learning disability; you barely made it past the third grade. People are how people are and who are you to criticize them, who are you to make jokes about them, and who are you to crush their self esteem, self respect, and spirit… When you yourself have troubles in all those categories. When you have the same troubles they have.  He told me that if you have to cry, then cry. It doesn’t make you less of a man and those who think less of you are idiots. He told me if you have to fight, then fight. Fight for what you believe in, fight for your family, and fight for those who can’t fight for their selves. He told me if you have to love. Then love with all your heart, your mind, your body, and your soul. And if you have to hate. Then hate that you didn’t try your best when you could have, hate that you are selfish, and hate that you allowed yourself to not believe in yourself in any aspect of life.  He told me that life is what I make of it and everyday I have the chance and opportunity to make it what I want. He told me that life is as hard as I make it and I need to let go and do what I can when I can. He told me that I make my own decisions on how my life will be led, I have the ability to choose right from wrong, and I am the only thing holding me back from my dreams.  This old man shared with me that the secret to my life is me. What I choose, what I say, how I act, what I believe, how happy I let myself be, and who I allow in my life.  He told me that nobody can live my life but me and I’ve known the secret to life all along, I just never opened my eyes long enough to realize it. I have the keys to everything I need, how I choose to use them is up to me. I am the secret to my life.  I shook his hand and he stood up and walked away. I never seen him again since then but I still have a feeling we’ll meet again.  TLDR: You're the secret of life."

DecidingToBeBetter,33xcfd,shanemitchell,9,Sun Apr 26 18:41:45 2015 UTC,"Grumpy old guy here.  This may sound incredibly trite, but I think it bears saying.  You are 19.  Every single 'problem' that you identified - antagonism with your father, laziness, shallow friendships, OCD, lack of discipline, are very typical of people your age.  So much so that that I question whether these are even problems.  Ever hear of the term, 'sophomoric'?  It it is a derogatory term that basically means 'immature,' and refers to things that are done by US college sophomores, typically 19 or 20 years old.  So, guess what?  You fit the profile for a typical 19-year-old, legally 'a man' (over 18, votes, can be convicted for crimes) but not yet 'an adult' (under 21, cannot consume alcohol, enter certain events.)  The solution, I think, is to simply chill out and accept that you lack sufficient life experience to put everything in your life together in a cohesive, tidy package.  Your energies are going to be scattered, and you are going to find that some things that you are doing are going to lead you to blind alleys, detours, confusion, and the like.  But each person needs to find out what works for them alone, and nobody can do the work for you, nor tell you that there is a single, comprehensive 'discipline' that will solve all your complexities.  One man's bottomless pit is another man's gold mine.  So, just gather as much 'experience' as you can at this point, be willing to go down some dead ends, commit to some fruitless endeavors, and, well, be occasionally sophomoric.  But don't berate yourself for not having the focus and singleness of purpose that a 40-year-old has.  While it would be nice to simply make all the right choices at your age, it's likely that you are going to make some mistakes.  So own it.  One of the fine attributes that people your age have is resiliency, which will allow you to bounce back from those undisciplined errors much more rapidly than older folks are capable of.  So, embrace the chaos, diffusion, angst, irrelevancy, and downright stupidity in your life right now with a little humor and grace.  The stage in your life that you are in right now is just fine, and an absolutely necessary stepping-stone to the next one.  Relax, you're normal."
DecidingToBeBetter,33xcfd,pizzaforce3,2,Sun Apr 26 18:23:17 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Welcome to your journey.   Identify what your goals are. Identify what steps you need to do to reach those goals. Break those steps into tiny, bite-sized, prioritized habits or actions you can do over time - weekly, for example. There you go.   Also, if you feel absolutely in a rut, try finding a counselor you click with. 2 months of therapy is not going to break the bank. And like compounding interest! 2 months now or 12 months when you're 30 with a family to provide for.   And because I never got any use out of internet gems such as this comment, grab Canfield's Success Principles and dig into it for about 4 hours. Pay for it so you're invested in doing the exercises.   And hey, go easy on yourself. Celebrate little successes and know that some days are just there for resting & recuperating. Some days are for hanging out with people, doing stuff, and getting out of your head.   Good luck :)"

Calling yourself ""weak"" and fighting those feelings will not make them go away. I promise.   If you want to make a change, you must first accept yourself as you are. Meditation is great for this. I recommend downloading an app called ""Headspace."" It's guided meditations that will help you feel your thoughts and emotions, without being overcome by them. Give it a chance and see what happens."
DecidingToBeBetter,33y1f5,rbr88758,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:03:07 2015 UTC,"So, because you're not stone-cold calloused to the world, because you care about emotions and you don't like conflict, you're weak? I can tell you dude, telling people this is pretty fucking strong. The world's tough, sure, but you can take these things you see as weaknesses and turn them into strengths.   Drink does shit to everyone's barriers. For some, (like you and I) it makes us emotional, and spill the beans on whatever shit we feel is important (""I don't want just any girl, I want her"" was a favourite of mine :p). For some, they turn into grabby, arrogant pricks who seem to get all of da pusi b0ss. Others just get a confidence boost, like myself. I get a boost of confidence, followed closely by a wave of emotion that I can't deal with.   But, with regards helping you with your problem, the best I can say is to not call yourself weak. If you tell yourself that you're weak, you'll come to believe it, and then it'll be the truth. You need to believe you're strong before you can become strong. Things like this take time. For some people, it clicks at a certain point. For others, it needs to be built. You and I, friend - we're young.   Now is the time of our lives to be building this feeling about ourselves."
DecidingToBeBetter,33y1f5,ManxmanoftheNorth,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:23:48 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between being sensitive and being weak. What you describe sounds to me like you're a sensitive man who has not yet learned that it is OK to be sensitive.  I've struggled with this myself. I have always been more sensitive and emotional then my guy friends. I'm familiar with the feeling of thinking I was broken and wishing I could just ""man up."" Fortunately I've been able to move past that (for the most part, I'm not perfect) and accept that being sensitive is a gift, thought it may sometimes feel like a curse.  There are two things I suggest:   1 - Learn what it means to be a sensitive man. Here's a good starting point: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sense-and-sensitivity/201411/sensitive-and-strong-can-we-really-be-both  2 - Find a counselor/therapist to help you learn to accept and love yourself.  Asking for help is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of strength and courage. You've shown strength and courage by sharing your story here, a therapist could help you learn who you are and how to see the strengths you possess more clearly.  Some of the difficulty you've experienced in controlling your emotions could be a chemical issue that medication could help with. One of the best things I ever did was deciding that I was willing to try taking medication to deal with my depression/anxiety. It has made a world of difference. There's no such thing as a happy pill, but it has helped regulate my moods and emotions in a very positive way.  Medication is not a cure-all and is not for everyone. I only mention it because I know how strong the stigma around anti-depressants is. It took me almost three years of therapy before I was even willing to consider it as a viable option. I wish I'd have been open to it sooner."

Once I accepted it, I actually grew away from it.  We are who we are.  Fuck me for taking it personally,  right?   So you've embarrassed yourself in the past.

The year I gave up reading my mind literally slowed down. My vocabulary suffered, my critical thinking skills slowed down, my ability to process incoming information was hurt.   When my next birthday rolled around and I began reading books again it took only a few weeks before I could feel myself begining to think quicker, remember better, and all around use my brain the way it wanted to be used.   As a side note, I don't read non-fiction or self help or educational books. I'm strictly a Fantasy Fiction, wizards and dragons kind of reader. So it wasn't the material presented in the book so much as the process of reading itself and how it affected my brain."

I used to be a voracious reader but for some unclear reason I stopped reading books for about 6 years. Absolutely ridiculous in hindsight - I became addicted to reading only the Internet (for the most part not a source of quality reading) and playing video games and binge watching Netflix. My mind has totally suffered as a result.  Edit: I know exactly what happened. I had to get my first smart phone (for work) and started surfing Reddit on my phone during the times I would have usually picked up a book. Oops.  I started reading books again last year. I'm not as quick a reader as I used to be, and my vocabulary has atrophied, and sometimes it feels like a chore when I'm low-energy and craving some ""instant entertainment"". But I'm fantastically pleased to have this be a part of my life again.  Oh and based on your stated reading preferences I highly recommend ""The Wizard Knight"" duology by Gene Wolfe."

The interesting thing, looking back on it, was that up to that point I had sort of a public reputation for reading a lot, ""oh he reads so much!"" and so forth, so I had sort of internalized it as part of my self image. So I went on buying books and downloading stuff that was public domain, anything potentially interesting. And then I would be spending my actual free time playing video games or surfing the web mindlessly. I would put podcasts on and play Diablo and zone out, thinking I was learning stuff when really I was just getting stoned (I really mean this) off of watching pretty numbers while comforting sounds play in the background.  And then one day I looked at my shelf and thought, I haven't actually read a fuck ton of these things. Its a weird moment when you realize that your self image and your actions aren't lining up, that I was to a certain extent faking being some kind of quasi-intellectual. I haven't purchased a book in like a year now because I'm working my way through my backlog and trying to be more honest with myself about where my time goes. It really is worth it.  Also Gene Wolf is the man. The Book of the New Sun is the best science fiction series I have ever read."

DecidingToBeBetter,33v35i,StoneSpace,5,Sun Apr 26 01:40:50 2015 UTC,"When I was your age, I felt extremely short-changed because I'd been sold a narrative that if I studied hard and graduated from uni, I would prosper. But we're Millennials and and that narrative doesn't exist anymore.  Yes, some office jobs are sole crushing but not all of them are. Don't let that turn you off the idea of an office job altogether. I'm in insurance, an industry I never, ever thought I would be in. But, I have a disposable income for the first time in my life, I love the people I work with, I'm not bored for a nano-second and that's more important to me than finding depth in what I ""do for a living"". I didn't get it on the first try; it took me several jobs to get to where I am.  What I do from 9-5 doesn't define me; rather, it allows me to enjoy my actual life in the evening, weekends and annual leave. And anyone who wants to roll their eyes when I say I work in insurance can go fuck themselves.  Do not get your masters because you don't know what else to do or it's what all your friends are doing. That's the coward's way out of adulting. I graduated uni in 2008 so all of my friends went to grad school, half of them dropped out and now they have triple the debt and are 2-3 years behind me in job experience. This doesn't sound like a lot but is the difference between ""entry level"" and a management position in my industry.  Yes, some people ""have a masters degree"" but in my experience, employers are more interested in whether or not you know email etiquette and how the fax machine works than your higher education.   I have found that my friendships from uni are hard to cultivate in the adult world. I'm still close with my uni roommate but otherwise when I hung out with my ""crowd"", I felt like I was desperately grasping onto a really happy time in my life that no longer existed. Like you mention, it wasn't the same and that fucking sucked. I've since found a new circle of friends who are more reflective of where my life is now instead of trying to hold onto something that once was. I'm not saying dump your friends but like any transition in life, there will be shifts in the people you surround yourself with.  If you're living with the parents, take advantage of that opportunity. Want to grow your online shop? Get up, get dressed, devote yourself to it 6-8 hours per week day. Always wanted to work with animals? Apply for a vet tech position. Just need to get out of the house? Go to your local cafe and ask if they need help; learning how to make coffee is an excellent life skill, there will always be demand for baristas. See a job for landscaping? Fucking go for it and get some Vitamin D. Maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll hate it but you might come away with some funny stories.   Few people know what they wanted to do with their lives and most people fall into an industry or career by mistake (see above: left-wing, bleeding heart liberal majoring in Social Work ending up in insurance). I don't want to minimize that it might be difficult for you to be back home, but you should feel a little bit terrible about saying that about your parents because it is an excellent financial position to be in.  And I second /u/StoneSpace, go for a walk. Take along a notebook and write down ideas and thoughts. No on ever regretted going for a walk."

Sure, you want to live your life and have fun, and I'm definitely not saying to avoid that. But many of my nights spent with friends end up leaving me feeling unfulfilled. It gets old. You want what you can't have, and the grass always seems greener on the other side. You know? Also, to quote my man Arnold Schwarzenegger, ""if you're out there partying, or horsing around, someone out there is working hard, and someone out there is winning. just remember that.""  If I were you, I would continue to live with your parents, work on and hustle your business for like... 6 months, and see what happens. Obviously make time for friends when you can. Perhaps I've been reading too much r/personalfinance, but the chance to live for free allows you to get far far ahead of most people our age -- especially the people who are at university for X more years before they become viable earners. Plus, if you start life as an entrepreneur, you may just fall in love with it. Failure is inevitable, but it will ultimately lead to success. Just my 2 cents -- I wish you much happiness.   P.S. I wasn't able to see a lot of my friends for a year after I graduated college. I was stuck at home with parents, working a full-time job and feeling trapped. When I felt depressed, I started a workout program. Focusing on improving yourself can have an array of positive benefits beyond what you initially intend.

I did the latter. I actually had a less than stellar experience with AmeriCorps, but if you PM me, I'll explain how to avoid some of the mistakes I made.

DO NOT GO BACK TO GRAD SCHOOL for the sake of going back to a predictable environment.   I also volunteered a lot while working retail jobs, since I knew I didn't want to do retail for the rest of life. So I volunteered as a Big Sister, English as a Second Language tutor, ESL TA, 6th grade co-teacher, among other things ...   Edit: Formatting"

Too take a moment and think about how glorious the idea of humanity is, is to realize that your problem is minuscule and can be solved. The stress from not being able to pay your rent or something comes for a belief that you can't. But you end up doing it any way. I've had this type of stress before and I always end up finding a way. The time I wasted stressing about it is what caused me grief. Realize that you can do it and think of solutions. Don't let the problem overwhelm you."

DecidingToBeBetter,33r2s2,Lu93,17,Sat Apr 25 05:39:29 2015 UTC,"Well your website is your job then and you're generating revenue from it, thus you have a vested interest in posting here. I much prefer seeing posts that are genuine requests because I think ""these people actually want help"". You're just trying to make money out of gullible people online and it's reprehensible.  And I don't think your tips are helpful. If anything, they're cliched, new-age psychobabble.  Especially this part:   If you have the technology and skills to read this sentence, you are the wealthiest 1% of the world.   This is just patently untrue. There are major inequalities between rich and poor in society. The 1% are billionaires and millionaires. Having technology and the ability to read does not make you the 1%. Even people in poor countries in Asia have mobile phones and can read yet they live in little huts. They're not in the 1%-they're in a third world country. There's no point glossing over social inequality by telling people to be grateful. That's not an answer to anything. If anything, it reminds me of George Orwell's 1984 and groupthink. Critical thinking is very important as it enables people to think for themselves and reflect on issues and come to their own solutions...solutions that suit them and their lives.  And your advice on minimalism is just not practical. What about people who have children-who actually need money to educate them? People need a car to be able to go to work. There's nothing wrong with owning possessions...it's actually a good thing. We live in a capitalist society. Having financial independence gives people choices. If someone is in an abusive relationship, having money means they're able to leave the situation. Having money means someone is able to travel the world. Having money means that you're not stuck in life.   I also don't think it matters whether you take a cold shower or not. I don't see how this would automatically lead to improved discipline. A more practical tip would be to encourage people to actually work harder than give them quick-fix solutions that won't solve the problem. If you're not achieving enough, then you need to work harder-that's the bottom line."

Some businesses have a stakeholder model whereas others have a shareholder model.   They expect money, because they have to live as well.   Businesses need to make money however it's also good for them to have ethical practices. I don't think it's ethical to come on reddit and tout for business. Reddit isn't supposed to be used for advertising. It's a free website for users.    My problem with this post is that I am not sure if it is plausible. I think it is broscience.   Agree with you here. I think it's pseudo-science and none of the claims given above can really be backed up by any evidence. For example, is there any proof that cold showers make people more disciplined and productive? Some successful people might have cold showers however that's just a personal habit of theirs. There's no correlation between their success and taking a cold shower; thus it's an illogical conclusion."

I also am suspicious of the ""self-help"" industry as it can make some dubious claims that are actually really harmful to people e.g positive thinking cures cancer. It can financially exploit vulnerable people who may be battling illness or mental health issues. I think that's morally wrong. The self-help industry is completely unregulated. Literally anyone can set up a website and call themselves an expert but the OP didn't even list his qualifications or training. I don't think that's good enough.   If a user posts here saying that they found something helpful, that's different because it doesn't involve money. There's less chance of financial exploitation and a higher probability of the post being genuine."

I do use some mindfulness techniques for stress management however I also balance that with a common sense approach.   I also didn't resort to an ad hominem attack on the OP. I addressed each of his points and argued against them. You clearly have a weak argument if you have to resort to a personal attack.

I don't need your permission to voice my opinion.    It just sounds like you cannot see things from a different perspective   No, I think this is your problem, not mine. I addressed each of the OP's arguments so I disagreed in an assertive manner. Whereas you were aggressive.   something I am not perfect at   I'm well aware of that-you don't need to tell me that.    Calling you ignorant wasn't a personal attack, just a statement,   It's a personal attack. A statement is a fact and objective whereas calling me ignorant is subjective and merely your opinion. You didn't like what I had to say but instead of addressing my arguments, you resorted to insults. That's childish, juvenile behavior.   because you didn't reconize that OP and others might benefit from these advice(s?).   The OP has a vested interest in posting here. He's just promoting his website. I would rather read posts from people who don't have vested interests- that way, it's non-biased and impartial.   I got the feeling you were aiming for money   You jumped to conclusions and assumed what my motivation was as opposed to asking for clarification.    while I care more about mental health and peace of mind.   It seems like you can't tolerate people with different values to you. You talk about Buddhism and peace of mind yet you seem to have these rigid views and dislike when someone disagrees with you. Tolerance is about listening to other points of view.  I actually have an interest in mental health and wellness too so it just proves that jumping to conclusions can be unwise.    I doubt you would agree with my anti-capitalist pro minimalism thinking.   The OP's post is an advertisement yet you're defending it. You're contradicting yourself right there. I would like this subreddit to be an advertisement-free zone whereby no-one can post links to their website or blog. I'm surprised it's not against the subreddit's rules.    I (like to) think I have a pretty good argument (okay, I actualy do),    Even using filler words such as ""like to"" and ""okay I actually do"" demonstrates that you have a weak argument. If you had a strong argument, you would be able to argue your points effectively however you haven't demonstrated this ability therefore I must conclude that your argument is weak.    But I do reconize I would not have Internet nor smartphone, and maybe even running water, if it were not for capitalism.   Having a smartphone is not minimalist. Surely a minimalist would say that you don't need a smartphone-that you could get by with a less fancy phone.   Again, you're contradicting yourself. You're complaining about capitalism yet freely taking advantage of its benefits.    Rent can be paid pretty easy if you didn't always needed more and more.   This is untrue. Rent is expensive in many areas."
DecidingToBeBetter,33r2s2,Matt1441,3,Sat Apr 25 07:05:07 2015 UTC,"Oh stop it.   Stop asserting myself? Is that what you mean?   Yea I am contradicting myself   Finally, you admit it   I do this because I don't have 'the correct answer' - if this even exists. To contradict oneself is not wrong   Contradicting yourself means that you have a weak argument. If you had a clear, concise argument, you would adopt a definite position however it seems as if you're not even sure what you believe in.    I do see some obvious faults with capitalism (greed, climate, inequality, exploration of the weak ect.), but I also reconize it advantages (moving the species/west forward at a greate pace).   I already explored some faults of capitalism above-i.e. social inequality. I actually explored the pros and cons of capitalism above. I talk about ethical business practices above too. I think the OP was unethical for advertising his website here.  However, I also said that I live in a capitalist society so I have to make the best of that system. I have to pay rent so yes, achievement and status are important to me. Without achievement, there would be no advancement in society. Things would remain static. Scientists wouldn't be able to come up with new treatments for illness. You wouldn't even have a smartphone were it not for achievement. Even having running water requires having an efficient water system. So education and training is really important.   I think that it's possible to have an interest in well-being while still wanting to achieve in life.     I don't need to be right, especially when you seems to be very touchy, need-to-be-right or something. Fine with me, but you got me all wrong.   If you don't need to be right, then why did you post such an aggressive response to me? You resorted to insults as opposed to addressing my argument. Therefore, I stood up for myself and clearly, you don't like that however that's not my problem-it's yours."

DecidingToBeBetter,33s09h,ohsnapt,2,Sat Apr 25 01:40:49 2015 UTC,"I think revenge is a tempting suggestion however I think it's best to think long-term. They do say that revenge is a dish best served cold so don't make any sudden knee-jerk reactions. Think it through logically and then do what's best for you. If someone has dumped you, then they don't really want you so they might not even care that you are with someone else. And even if they do, you're just wasting energy engaging with the person. So my tactic is to feign indifference-ignore the person, cut them out of my life completely and give them no attention at all. This can really piss people off because no-one likes not getting attention.  Withdrawing from life isn't the answer because how long can you do that for? A day or two-fine but that's it..stop moping then and go for a walk, do something to engage with life again.  You can fuel your anger into achievement..into setting goals. Into exercise-into running and cardio..any kind of vigorous exercise. It just gets the anger out of your system.   I don't find that writing my feelings down when I'm angry helps. I actually have to calm down so whether that's by going for a walk, having a shower, having a cup of tea, watching a film, socializing with friends. Distracting yourself and keeping busy helps a lot. Dwelling on it doesn't help. I don't find talking about a breakup for long periods helpful either. I think it's fine to talk about it for a while but then change the subject. Even if you want to keep talking about it, resist that urge.  tl,dr: think logically, think long term, think about the consequences of your actions. Focus on goals. Distract yourself. Exercise a lot-run and other types of vigorous exercise."

The metaphor refers to a pot of crabs. Individually, the crabs could easily escape from the pot, but instead, they grab at each other in a useless ""king of the hill"" competition which prevents any from escaping and ensures their collective demise.   The analogy in human behavior is sometimes claimed to be that members of a group will attempt to ""pull down"" (negate or diminish the importance of) any member who achieves success beyond the others, out of envy, conspiracy or competitive feelings, although this is not the behavior being exhibited by the crabs which are simply trying to escape themselves, without any knowledge or understanding of the supposed ""success"" of their fellow creatures. Thus the analogy fails and can be seen as merely the attempt to shore up a pre-existing political viewpoint using a spurious appeal to ""natural"" behaviour..

Or would you be cheering him?  It better be the latter!  Be the friend you want to have and ditch the ones you don't deserve.  You deserve friends that cheer you on!  Don't get me wrong - it's okay to think ""Man, I wish I had a great job like that!"" but you should also be genuinely happy for your friend too!  Anyways, Congratulations on all the awesome work your doing.  And I hope you and your new gal work out!  As well as that new job!  Yay!  You've got some exciting things going on right now and that is awesome.  Don't let anyone hold ya back!"

The dynamics have changed and they felt threatened by it but it's not your problem-it's theirs.   I'm not saying you were a loser ever but I think that's how they saw you-that you weren't a threat to them back then and maybe that you were too passive-willing to do them favors all the time etc whereas now you're more assertive-you're pursuing activities and goals that you want and maybe these friends aren't getting their way with you now. Maybe you're telling them ""no"" more and they feel frustrated because you used to say ""yes"" to every request.

I think it is normal for people to have a small amount of jealousy in these types of situations but not a large amount of jealousy or acting out.  For example, it is normal to be disappointed and hurt to be passed over for a promotion.  Perhaps the fact that they told you about it indicates they consider you to be a friend.    On the other hand, it was totally inappropriate for your friend to be ""livid"" that you went on a trip that the friend really couldn't go on anyway.  Your friend does not control your life or make the rules.  The friend could calmly express disappointment and suggest the two of you go on another trip another time.  As for the dating, rejection is a normal, albeit painful, part of dating.  These ladies will get over it."

I definitely think that you should bring up all of these concerns with your therapist because it seems like there must have been some kind of events or people in your life that caused you to view yourself like this and your therapist should help uncover those and help you understand why you view yourself like this, which is where you can start to heal.

I was in therapy before and found the time in between sessions unbearable too so you're not alone there.  My advice would be to distract-go for a walk, exercise, keep busy. Also self-soothe-make yourself a cup of tea, put on body lotion, have a shower, watch a film, read a book, put cosy clothes on. If you feel sad, go for a walk whereas if you feel anxious or angry, do vigorous exercise-cardio, running, jogging. The walk will just give you a gentle pick you up whereas if you feel anxious/angry, then the  exercise will release the cortisol generated from the stress.   Make sure that you practice good self-care too..eat well, get enough sleep, exercise, manage your money, manage your time etc because if you don't practice good self-care, then things just seem even more stressful.  This is not a solution per se but it'll enable you to get through the week and manage the time in between therapy sessions."

I try to only vocalize 1 out of every 5 things that I think of.  Also, I read a leadership article that mentioned that people will more often join if they are asked rather than told.  Use your bossiness to your advantage.  I've been the den mother/organizer of a group vacation for years and it takes some bossiness to keep it running smoothly.

DecidingToBeBetter,33o7nw,throwawaysunshine2,2,Fri Apr 24 09:33:22 2015 UTC,"Don't give people advice unless they ask for it. A lot of the time, if people are complaining about something, they just want you to listen to them..they want emotional support/to be able to vent. A bossy person will interpret this as meaning ""they want me to fix the problem for them"" and they end up telling the person ""do x/y/z"". I was bossy in the past so that's how I know this. I ended up having people who swore on my advice..who'd ask my advice on everything and it was exhausting. Or else I'd have people who hated me for giving unsolicited advice.   I also prefer talking more than listening. Learning how to listen was key. It makes me seem more approachable, reasonable, willing to compromise. The way I learned how to listen was not to interrupt people. I'd interrupt people all the time-let people finish their sentence no matter how stupid you think it is and then respond. Sometimes, this does involve biting your tongue but just try it out anyway and you'll find that you get good results from it.  I read books on communication skills. ""The Feeling Good Handbook"" by David Burns is a good one because it has chapters on communication skills. It gives you certain lines to say in conflict situations like ""I understand how you feel however I think..."" and that seems more reasonable to other people than telling them just how wrong they are.   It also gave a tip of focusing on the problem as opposed to the person. Don't make it personal..don't make personal attacks. Focus on the person's behavior. So say your boyfriend hasn't washed the dishes, don't say ""I can't believe you're so lazy"" because this is seen as blaming and will just cause your boyfriend to be defensive and things will escalate into an argument. Say something like ""I would appreciate if you wash the dishes"" and if he refuses, then set some kind of consequence like setting a rota so that you still get what you want but aren't seen as overbearing either. I think that reading about assertiveness would help too because bossy behavior is seen as aggressive by other people. A bossy person would say ""I'm only standing up for myself"" so reading about assertiveness will enable you to still stand up for yourself but also get along with people more.   ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie is a good one too. It has advice that praising people in work is more beneficial than criticizing them...that it'll get them to do what you want. This bit really helped because if I was dealing with incompetent co-workers in the past, I'd feel so frustrated whereas Carnegie says that ""you catch more flies with honey than vinegar""..basically, that if you're pleasant, people are more inclined to do what you want than if you're mean about it. The book also says that people love talking about themselves so act like you're interested in what they have to say even if you're not (basically what I said above about listening but the book gives lots of practical examples so even if you don't know where to start, you can just underline the examples)."

DecidingToBeBetter,33nbv7,jinbeizame,2,Fri Apr 24 02:26:58 2015 UTC,"I had this problem too and I found that doing one thing at a time helped me focus. I can't multi-task. I need to concentrate on what I'm doing so that means no talking while I'm doing it, no music or TV on.   I was in a 12 step group and they have a saying ""first things first"" which basically means do the most important/urgent thing first and then work from there. I know that it can feel incredibly overwhelming when you have so many many thing to do and feel that you'll never get it all done.  If I feel really unmotivated, I tell myself to take it five minutes at a time. I used to use this for the gym so I'd spend 5 times at a time on the treadmill and before you'd know it, I'd have completed the 30 minutes necessary. Then I'd go on the cross trainer which I hate but again, I'd say ""I only have to do this for 5 minutes"" and before you know it, I'd meet my goal that way too. I'm using the gym as an example of where I found it useful but you can use this method for anything.   If you're setting goals, figure out your overall goal but break it down into short-term ones and set yourself clear targets. In layman's terms, think a week ahead, see what progress you're making and then review to see if you're doing well or whether you need to do anything different for the following week.  I think that keeping a log of what you do can be useful as well. I don't find ticking things off helpful though. I literally need to write it down and log it for it to count. I'm sure there are apps for this if you dislike having to write things down but for me, writing it down works well."

DecidingToBeBetter,33ngnf,CynicalJill,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:54:09 2015 UTC,"I'm copying and pasting this old comment of mine that I left earlier, for someone who asked the same question:  Organic really just means that they don't give the cows hormones or put hormones in their feed/are grass fed, and don't use antibiotics on the cows. I think that is certainly a nice thing for the people consuming the milk, but it doesn't really protect the cow from the standard cruelties of the dairy industry.  Cows produce milk when they have a baby (just like all mammals, such as human women!). Diary farmers inject bull semen to impregnate their cows, and after the calf is born, immediately separate baby/mother.  This usually happens the same day or the next day after birth. Normally cows nurse and raise their calves for 9 - 12 months, but this separation must occur to prevent the calf from nursing from the mother and drinking her milk that is supposed to be sold by the farmer for human consumption instead. So in practice, what we have is humans drinking the milk that belongs to the calf, and the calf usually given formula (if it is allowed to live).  The question of what happens to the calf depends on it's gender - if male, it will likely be sold off for veal, or in a few cases for cheap beef. If female, she will be raised on formula to be a replacement dairy cow. Dairy cows are usually impregnated and go through this calf-separation many times during their lives because they produce the most milk in the 3 months immediately after giving birth to a calf. This is why many people say that a glass of milk is a glass of veal. After the dairy cow is spent, she is sold for slaughter and is made into beef. The average age for slaughter of dairy cows is 5 years, while normally healthy cows live for 20 - 25 years. Please remember that the standard procedure of ""humane"" slaughter is to first be shot in the head with a stun bolt to be knocked unconscious, then hung upside down by the legs, and then having the throat slit. The animal is then bled out for several minutes until they finally die.  A lot of farmers and people say that dairy cows don't care or even notice when their calves are taken from them - this is a bald faced lie. Cows are loving, caring mothers to their calves and absolutely are distressed when their calves go missing immediately after giving birth. Please note that these practices are universal and without them, dairy production would not be financially possible no matter what. This includes small family dairies, even local, loving ones who care about their animals. I don't doubt that some farmers care for their animals and avoid abusing them, but these practices are inherent in dairy farming. There is only one slaughter-free dairy farm in America, and one is in the UK. The US one is in Pennsylvania, and is a non-profit run by a hare-krishna woman with very limited, local distribution for about 15$ a gallon, and further subsidized by many generous animal lovers who donate to the farm. The one in the UK is called Ahimsa dairy. I emphasize that their production is extremely limited, and only possible because of donations.  Anyway, I expanded in case you were interested and didn't know. I encourage anyone sympathetic to the suffering of baby calves and cows to try ""alternative"" milks like almond milk, soy milk, rice milk, oat milk, hemp milk, cashew milk, etc! :)"

DecidingToBeBetter,33ngnf,livingforblank,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:42:23 2015 UTC,"You said that meat consumption is an issue of ""individual will power"", which implies that people who eat meat are inherently irrational.

DecidingToBeBetter,33ngnf,fernguts,2,Fri Apr 24 22:34:11 2015 UTC,"Isn't that the reason most people eat meat? Because they enjoy the taste? I've come across a lot of people who agree that eating meat is ""wrong"" but continue doing it bc they like it too much. That's an issue of will power.  Of course there's also people out there who don't think eating meat is wrong - but their ""reasons"", yes, are based in some irrational reasoning, for the most part. ""Unhealthy"" ""Too expensive"" ""Too complicated"" ""We need meat"" etc. ""Without meat those animals would never have a life"" ""They'd go extinct"" ""They'd take over the world if we didn't kill them"" ""God put them here for us to eat"" ""They don't feel anything"" ""They aren't sentient"" ""Killing animals is the same as killing plants"" ""Plants suffer as much as animals"" ""Dogs/cats abuse is wrong, but meat is okay"" ""I like eating meat so that makes it permissible"" ""We have always eaten meat"" etc. The list is endless...  I'm not being condescending, I'm really not. I used to be a non-vegan too, I get it. I'm just saying that the only factual reason people continue to eat meat in this day and age is because they enjoy the taste of it. So I don't think it's inaccurate to say that limiting/eliminating our animal eating is a matter of will power."

Remember, we all slip up, especially in the beginning, and doing something and caring, is always better than doing nothing. Even just starting with eating less of the animal stuff is great :) I recommend almond milk, by the way!"

There are some fantastic questions at the end of the talk if you make it that far.  I appreciate that this subreddit is all about self improvement and at first the idea of falling into mediocrity might seem like a get-out clause. It is not meant to be taken that way at all.

It's a bit of a brute force method, and involves repeated practice and reinforcement, but it worked for me.   I tell my girlfriend that your thoughts become reality. They affect your mindset, which in turn affects your actions and decisions.  I learned this when I was in high school. One day, I got tired of being down about my lack of physical ability, relationship prospects, family stuff, just lots piling on. Then, I decided to start telling myself that I'm awesome.   It started out feeling like I was lying to myself. Over time, I got into a habit of thinking, ""Of course I can do this. I'm awesome!"" I held that thought for a few weeks, then I thought about it reflexively. At that point, it had become part of my thought process, which affected my actions and feelings.   I want to ask that girl out? Of course she'll say yes, who wouldn't? This skill I'm learning is extremely tough. But hey, other people have done it before, so I can too. I'm nervous about going to this party where I barely know anyone. It'll be fine, I mean, I'm interesting and funny!   It may sound arrogant, but the trick is to make yourself believe that you're whatever you want to be by telling yourself something over and over. Just don't get so carried away that you think you're MORE awesome than others around you. They're all just the same as you.   Basically, start by telling yourself that you're already the way you want to feel, even if it feels like a lie. Then eventually, it becomes part of who you are, and becomes true.  I may just be spouting nonsense, but it worked for me, and has stuck for 15 years so far."

Look a specific tasks where the secondary effect gets you to where you want to be. As you start where you are make it as small as possible to start building momentum. Think of it like creating an avalanche. Its a lot easier to start pushing single pebbles instead of trying to launch an entire boulder. Once you get momentum you can increase those daily to dos into bigger things.  Do it. Whatever that daily thing is just do it. Make it a priority. It doesn't matter when or how much, something is more than nothing and something counts.  Track it. Those days when you feel less motivated or more helpless having a physical tangible object to look at or hold can help you push through those days. Give yourself a reward for your accomplishment. Make it immediate and make it meaningful. It doesn't have to be big or cost anything but it needs to be something.  Give it time. The Great Wall of China took 200 years to build, the pyramids of Egypt 20 years. It will take time to get beyond your feelings of helplessness and it will take time to see results from your daily ""do-ings"". Track it daily but give it time to see results, it won't happen overnight.

Any evidence that this is going to do some good?""    I'm not going to denounce analytical therapy that way.  It's just hard to evaluate insight about the formation of personality.  There's a myth about therapy, promoted by old Hollywood movies, that it cures people very dramatically.     As I understand it, what's called psychodynamic or analytical therapy has some support from research.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy has far more support from research, if only because it's much easier to study.    A psychologist would look at a problem like yours and think about reaching goals defined in terms of behavior, maybe with a set of objectves beginning with something really easy, which gives the client confidence.  There might be attention to impulse control.  Some think of the ""neurotic"" tendency to get panicky in stressful situations as learned (maybe imitation of a parent's reactions).  CBT teaches flexibility - calm consideration of alternatives to panic, deciding on the best response. If somebody reacts to any little setback by flying off the handle, he can learn the habit of slowing down, taking a few slow, deep breaths, and working out the solution.    The client who thinks of himself as imprisoned for life is set free.  BF Skinner, who devoted his life to a technology of control, the author of Beyond Freedom and Dignity, is remembered as the grandfather of a technology of liberation.   More and more, psychology is making use of mindfulness.  To learn about this, see ""How mindfulness can change your life"" on You Tube and MBCT.com.  There's also a short video with DBT founder Marsha Linehan explaining slow, deep ""paced breathing"" - an important stress-reduction method - ""Using mindfulness to regain control during crisis.""

In there I also have my to do list and when I get things done I move them to another page that I call my ""to done"" list and have a new page for each quarter of the calendar year so I can see what I did over the year and which quarter it was done in. It helps with writing annual performance reports.  Then I have a projects notebook with a section for each separate open project. I collect all my work on a weekly basis into that so I can go back from the day I took over the project and see each day I did it. I also take meeting notes right in the program (work laptop). The software also will keep files like a file folder and allow me to place notes next to each file so I don't have to open the file I can see at a glimpse what it is.  Personally: I use it to go on trips, I can put mass transit maps, pictures, and information about why a certain thing or place is significant, I transfer this over to my phone or tablet. I am about to start using it as a personal journal/diary.  As far as the usage of it goes it's setup to act just like a notebook with tabs/section and pages.

Also, it gives you tips on reads and videos. Audiobooks and interviews, it's stimulating! I suggest you, as I do to everbody, to read The 5 majour pieces of the life puzzle by Jim Rohn.

It's key to self improvement!   Jim often talked about keeping a journal, but just how should you do it?

And then you can learn how to here!  What can you advise me to read/listen next? What is your favourite Jim Rohn's book? I am re-reading the 5 pieces, and when I finish it I want something else. But I don't want something that says exactly the same thing. I want something a little specific. Not too specific, but something to focus on one specific argument.

I highly recommend trying ""The Willpower Instinct"" by Kelly McGonagall. The book is great because each chapter introduces you to a new technique for achieving your willpower goal and the science behind why you may be failing.  I have struggled with procrastination for my whole life (I am 25) and this book is helping me. I listened to it last year and am listening to it again now. I am on Chapter 4 (week 4) and do all the exercises as proscribed. Essentially introspective journaling, taking notes, and making a weekly plan.  I still fail some days; last night I played FIFA 15 with a friend until midnight instead of keeping my commitment to no electronics after 10pm. But since McGonagall explained why I fail at times I am feeling confident I will recommit.  Sorry for the long message but I find detailed messages of success and failure can really convey a strong message. I really hope this message helps you. Procrastination (or failing on your commitments) can cause a lot of pain and I hope you can make lasting change.  TL;DR -- The Willpower Instinct is a great book to help you achieve your goals and understand why you're failing in the first place!  P.S. -- Not a paid shill but I am carrying guilt because I use the audio book I found on YouTube :/ (for the record I did buy the book but didn't enjoy it as much as the audio)  P.P.S. -- If you're looking for another resource check out procrastination.ca there are great podcasts on there (a little long but still great)."

DecidingToBeBetter,339h49,gibmelson,16,Mon Apr 20 20:35:51 2015 UTC,"I've been there and the one advice I'd give myself is this: People and most of culture got this life thing backwards. Good outcomes doesn't make you happy, loving, secure, etc. Being happy, loving, secure, etc. leads to good outcomes. And the key to being happy etc. is all about your psychology - e.g. your ""intention"" and how you relate to everything.   Most people don't really have conscious intentions because they think it's all about outcome and technique. But we know for a fact that you can consume a pill and depending on if you think it will help you or hurt you - it will help you or hurt you. So you apply this to everything you do - when you wake up you give your day a positive intention (""Today I'll be happy, have fun and strengthen my body""). You do this when you catch yourself in the middle of something, e.g. when you browse reddit instead of saying ""I'm just here procrastinating"", you say ""I'm empowering myself and connecting with awesome people"". You can do this when eating food ""I'm giving my body good nourishment"", and you'll eat more slowly and consciously, your posture will naturally improve, you'll breath deeper, etc. all because you have a positive intention. If you go for a run with a negative intention ""I'm ugly I need to get in shape"" you'll hunch, your muscles will be tight, you resist every step you take - and you'll be ugly, perhaps injure yourself and give up.  As for how you relate to what arises in your psychology, the irrational advice I have is: love everything that arises, see everything as being helpful and working for you - even depression, your adhd, bad emotions such as: guilt, fear, envy, shame, impatience, feeling awkward, etc. by fully embracing them you transmute them.  As for outcomes - they don't really matter. You can fail miserably and if you see it as a learning experience you'll be content, maybe even happy and grateful. But if you focus on your intention you don't need to keep spinning and juggling outcomes, putting it in a good light (it's kinda exhausting). You can just focus on your intention and the good outcomes will follow.   If you really grok this it will liberate you from a lot of anxiety (such as worrying about circumstances, future events, etc). You'll be more empowered as you no longer depend on others as all your power is within. Just like a depression undermine what you do - taking charge of your psychology in these ways will enhance everything you do - it just works on a deeper level.  TL;DR: Good outcomes doesn't make you happy. Being happy leads to good outcomes. The key to being happy is your psychology - your intention and how you relate to everything."
DecidingToBeBetter,339h49,beyondtheridge,5,Mon Apr 20 22:50:13 2015 UTC,"The way I convince myself to do things I could put off is this:  I can hate seeing the dishes and garbage piled up, hate having to look at the mess, hate the smell, get aggravated pushing things out of the way to prepare food, etc., or I can hate the time I spend cleaning up, but them like having look nice, smell good, make food prep easy, etc. In other words it's worth the short hassle to clean up as I go than to have non-stop unpleasantness. I don't know if that helps you, but it works with my mind.   I wonder what is stopping you from looking for a new job. Is it fear you won't get it? Do you believe there will never be as good a job as that one you had? What other interests might you explore (because work shouldn't be your only motivation for living)?

Before making this thread I was reading an article on a Zen teaching ""Wash your bowl"" (http://www.asianefficiency.com/habits/wash-bowl/).  I think the idea is similar - focus on the simple / insignificant things as a start, since they are easy to do, which builds a foundation to fighting procrastination.  So when you eat a meal, you wash your bowl, so you don't have to do it before your next meal.  (In the religious text, I believe monks would only have one bowl they'd use for rice.  And of interesting note, another Zen teaching is while consuming the rice, since it was so easy to do, you could meditate at the same time - talk about multitasking!)"

Imagine that you're out at night in -30 C wind blowing as hell, and you are asked to design the next groundbreaking thing  on the spot.    Now imagine that you are asked to do the same thing in broad daylight in a comfortable breeze of 20C.  You will obviously perform better in the ideal setting. Those settings are your emotions, and everything you try to do is akin to mitigating the weather.  We understand weather patterns and we're slow to change our way of life in order to minimize the variability even though the planet is going to hell. In the same way, you need to figure out your deep rooted issues in order to tamper those mood swings, instead of trying to figure ways of maximizing the little time you have when your mood is ideal.  I've done it by myself with an indirect help of a girlfriend that put light on something that I didn't want to face. My girlfriend goes through counseling on a regular basis to keep herself centered.  The simple trick though is to meditate. When you have that nagging thought that relates to some serious deep issue of which you can't let go and fucks up your meditation, don't let it go. Take note of it, stop meditating, and put all your effort into solving it.  Example: your family saps you. Put boundaries. Your friends sap you. Put boundaries. You regret some shit. Fix it. You're not healthy. Get healthy.  Get help if you need to. It is much easier to get help when you finally defined the problem. All the stuff you've said are just symptoms. It's like having a runny nose, it can come from alot of things.  Good luck."

DecidingToBeBetter,339h49,The_Linear_Spiral,2,Mon Apr 20 22:00:31 2015 UTC,"Hey,  The idea came from reddit a few weeks ago where someone posted a concept where a teacher used gamification to help their students.  As you did homework, answers questions in class and so on, you earned points which could be traded in for unique perks like being able to bring a cheatsheet to an exam or skipping a question on a test.  For me, I made a spreadsheet with various tasks I want to accomplish and assigned a point value.  Then I made a list of things I can reward myself with and gave them a value.  I have some columns for tracking.  I also have some 'skill tree' goals.  For example, I want to improve my work/job seeking, my health, self care and routine (cleaning, chores, etc.).  Each area has 10-15 tasks, such as 'going outside' or 'take a 10 minute walk' for health/exercise.  I also have things I can reward myself with like 'play a game for an hour' or 'have a candy bar'.  For the skill tree, I imagine it like an RPG where as you progress up the skill tree, you are learning new abilities / skills to use.  However, instead of unlocking abilities, I made it as a progressing chart to track myself / motivate myself.  So at the bottom of my tree I have simple stuff like going for short walks or doing 10 minutes of job seeking.  These lead to harder tasks such as running for 10 minutes or doing job research.  As I progress, I can mark these areas off as 'complete'.  At the top of the tree are my life goals like finding a rewarding career, losing weight and conquering the world with robots.  Finally, as a monthly goal, I setup a milestone system with fun rewards.  Ie. After completing 50 activities or 1000 points I get 4 'entertainment hours' on the weekend.  I also have fun tasks like learning something new, playing with my pets, and similar things to get me out of my old groove.  However, I just started this a few days ago so I am still getting use to it, but it is pretty fun to keep track of the things I did and reward myself for it.  I am using only excel to keep track of things.  Though I've heard there are apps out there to help you out as you go.  Wikipedia on it (in general): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification"

DecidingToBeBetter,339h49,WAAITT,2,Tue Apr 21 04:52:15 2015 UTC,"Meditation and journaling are what are currently helping me get over similar problems. The meditation helps to train the mind to focus and gives you the perspective you need to do the things you need to do, and the journaling helps you to keep track of how you're doing and what you need to do.   I recommend meditating first thing in the morning and then journaling at night before you go to bed. I journal about my day, how I'm feeling, what I'd like to accomplish etc. Keep a list of goals/daily to do's in the journal that that you can check off as you complete and even reward yourself xp for . Also check out Headspace for a free 10 day guide to help you get started on meditation."
DecidingToBeBetter,339h49,Blitzcrankk,2,Tue Apr 21 14:58:00 2015 UTC,"sounds like me.  I started doing a little exercise, by walking in place in front of the tv for 5 minutes.  This helped with my concentration and energy levels.  I slowly increased it, but because I didn't do too much, I was always wanting to do more.  Exercise is like a miracle drug.  It helps with depression and ADHD as well.    Also, there's this medical intuitive called something Myss and she says that will power is in the throat chakra, so since I have a tendency to have a lot of throat infections, I started a regimen of gargling, flossing, putting vinegar in my ear, saline in my nose for sinuses and post nasal drip, to kill any possible type of infection.  So far, so good."

Or at least the same type of job somewhere that pays you more so you get a feeling it's worth your time.  My boyfriend has every other weekend off work. The other weeks his days off are all over the map. But for those weekends, we try to do this:  Friday: Lazy day. Absolutely no plans. He gets to sleep in and has no responsibilities.  Saturday: One fun thing and one big chore. So we might spend the morning bouldering with the dog at the lake, come home, make lunch and watch a movie. Then we spend a couple of hours doing yardwork. Shower. Make dinner. Spend the evening relaxing watching TV or reading or playing games.   That works for us. We accomplished things we planned and didn't overload ourselves.  Weekends are simply just too short. It never feels like it's been enough time. Find ways to feel accomplished about what you do get done. For me, sharing those accomplishments with someone (boyfriend, friends, family) makes it feel ""real."" Hope this helps a bit."

DecidingToBeBetter,3351pm,Meikami,7,Mon Apr 20 05:41:32 2015 UTC,ha! Good catch. It actually is Saturday and Sunday.  This is the first time in our adult lives we've had normal weekends off and my brain is still trying to adjust. ;p
DecidingToBeBetter,3351pm,rmck87,19,Mon Apr 20 05:55:43 2015 UTC,"Do something I love, just for me. Do something productive, usually a task around the house that has been haunting me all week. I try to do the productive stuff on Saturday so Sunday is spent enjoying the fruits of that labor. Get enough sleep. Get outside and enjoy the fresh air.    No matter what you do, though, it will probably feel like it's over too soon. If you finish the productive stuff early, though, it will feel like you had more free time, because you spent less of your weekend worrying about what needs to be done."
DecidingToBeBetter,3351pm,abstract_buffalo,16,Sun Apr 19 19:45:30 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a deeper issue than the weekend.  You're looking for something deeply satisfying -  regardless of the time constraint.  You're organized, being productive and accomplishing tasks, but your soul feels unsatisfied.    I'm not a huge proponent of finding hobbies...  It's a term  that now gets thrown around as a time occupier.  Riding your bike is the hobby but you're looking for something that gets you excited in the morning and keeps you up at night.    I can't really tell you how to find that other than  to say keep looking.  Keep searching inside for something that will truly give you meaning.  Ask yourself what are things you dream of but scare you the most.  That's a good place to start.  It might be creative, it might be helping people, it might be starting a company.  But ultimately, that's probably what you're looking  for to truly feel satisfied."

That's why I mentioned to keep searching, without actually saying how to do it.  I really don't believe there's an easy formula for it.  I believe some people stumble upon it easier than others and some never find it at all.  But if OP does somehow solve the illusive passion,  they  might no longer always feel that sense of unsatisfaction at the end of the day.   People say do something you love and love what you do.. But i love watching hockey and eating cookies.  My hobbies are blading and doing yoga...  While I love those things and they are my hobbies hobbies they certainly don't get my head dreaming and my heart racing.  I think that people are given a false impression..  So yeah.  All I can really say is what I think is missing and how to maybe look for it."
DecidingToBeBetter,3351pm,unionicola,11,Mon Apr 20 18:57:55 2015 UTC,"I get that feeling too. It sounds to me like you're definitely using your weekends well, so the issue is just that you're worrying about not using your time well, when you actually are. I took up mindfulness meditation at the start of this year and its about spending time being completely in the present moment, and letting thoughts arise and then letting them go  and going back to the present moment. And the app I use tells you to apply this during daily life, to clear your mind and be completely present with whatever you're doing. And honestly it sounds simple but it can be difficult, but once you start doing it so much improves. If you try to be in the present moment more during your weekends, you can enjoy your time, really feel like you engaged and fully enjoyed what you spend your time doing, and most importantly not be worrying about not spending your time well. I used an app called headspace which is a really good introduction to meditation, and you get 10 days free, so you could try it, and then if you didn't want to pay anymore you could find more online guided meditations once you get the basics. /r/meditation is a great resource. :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,3351pm,Rlysrh,2,Sun Apr 19 20:34:31 2015 UTC,Do you pay for headspace? Is it worth it?
DecidingToBeBetter,3351pm,the_fail_whale,2,Mon Apr 20 02:09:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do. And I think its worth it, because I was a complete beginner when I started using it, and I really had no idea what I was doing and headspace guides you into it, and gives you a lot of really useful information which is great if you're like me and too lazy to spend forever researching and trying to understand the different types of meditation online. But if you're already into meditation, and know quite a lot about it, its probably not really worth it."
DecidingToBeBetter,3351pm,FUNNYinside,4,Tue Apr 21 22:53:09 2015 UTC,"Have you considered downsizing your life financially so that you have more free time?  You could try to have a 4-day working week and then have 3 day weekends, either split up or in one chunk at the end of the week.   Now that I think about it, you could even try to negotiate with work to have longer days 4 days a week, so your overall hours are the same but you get 3 days off.  This would be good if you find you're  a bit useless after work in terms of making good use of your spare time, and you get a longer break to dedicate to yourself."

If you could ignore that voice in your head, a weekend such as this looks more like long weekend like a vacation and satisfying. You feel fresh on Monday. everything works out well. Slept for most part watched some TV/Gaming (Thinking you are wasting your time doing nothing Productive):  Worst weekend you will ever have, and each subsequent weekend will worsen the effect the guilt. Wasted almost whole weekend , BUT did one thing that you are passionate about:  If you are really involved in once thing for a few hours , it makes the whole weekend worthwhile. Doing a lot many Things , like a Duty, not enjoying: This seems to be your case, you are too much worried about productively utilizing your weekend, which in turn makes your expectations very high, you do a lot of things and which wears you down, and if on Monday you are more worked up than on Thursday, you are doing it wrong.   It is just two days, don't put too much pressure on it or on your mind, enjoy relax do something crazy, but enjoy, do something mundane and enjoy.

For example a one week vacation that has one peak experience and ends on a high note, feels both better at the time and as a memory (all we have really and it changes depending on our mood when recollecting it) than a two week vacation that has maybe 3 peak experiences, one bad experience and ends on a average or sour note."

DecidingToBeBetter,3351pm,unpotamus,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:57:14 2015 UTC,"I think you might need to look at changing your perception.  If you're only valuing your time by how much 'productivity' (using that for lack of a better word - it seems like you're even measuring your leisure by how much of it you can get in) you get out of it, you're overlooking the things you're already doing.  There will always be more to do.  Instead, try focusing only on the thing you are doing.  Do it until you are satisfied with that one aspect.  Maybe it's rearranging the garage on Saturday morning.  Once you've done that to satisfaction than you can mentally reaffirm yourself by saying 'I was productive today.  I completed my project.  I am satisfied with my project's result'.    Then, no mater what else happens, at the end of the day you can look back and be satisfied with that aspect.  If you completed one goal, you've progressed, and that's a good thing."

From reading your paragraph I get the feeling you are go go go even when you try to relax. You are searching so hard for that easy time that stress takes the joy out and makes it end before you can begin. Begin to relax is what I mean in this case. Begin to be present. Being present is the hardest thing I've encountered but totally worth it. How does one become present? In this capacity I am no professional. I recommend counseling on the topic. ""How do I become more present."" is the goal to tell the therapist that you wish to reach. I know this sounds ridiculous. I believe in it I will suggest it none the less. There are many resource materials on the internet in general. Be careful which one you choose. You are in your own hands when you take this rout. I hope I've been forthcoming yet not rude.

Find out what they did to make them competitive to be accepted. I don't know about MIT but I always hear those schools look for people who are ""well rounded"" not just academic hounds. Learn how MIT defines well rounded and do those things, become involved in them. If you find people to talk to and they know people who applied and were not accepted, find out why person A was accepted and person B wasn't.

I had some success in becoming happier without recognising that I identified with my depression, anxiety and PTSD, and once I got to a certain degree of success I fell into a devastating identity crisis.  I had spent so long identifying with this narrative of things that have happened to me, taking it away made me unsure of who I was as a person.  That is the key, or at least it was for me. I had to ""discover myself"" - I read a lot, wrote a lot, and did a lot of questioning myself. What my values and priorities were, what I wanted for the future, and what kind of person I really wanted to be.  One of the most helpful tools I used was meditation. It might not be for everyone, but it might help you, along with answering the questions above.  Best of luck to you."

DecidingToBeBetter,334bdx,Meikami,4,Mon Apr 20 13:19:50 2015 UTC,"You're doing what many of us do or have done, and you're falling into the temptation of self-pity. It seems like such a cushy place, where people will take care of you and you don't have to take responsibility for your mood. Life made you this way! But it's a lie.   The events that happen in your life will be part your control, and part outside of your control. Sometimes shit will happen. You will be dealt a bad hand.   But, it's still YOUR life. And you are still the only person responsible for how you live with the cards you've been dealt.  Here's the key to it all: YOU get to have the final say in how life affects you. YOU get to say ""yeah, well, I'm happy anyway."" YOU get to choose how you react. YOU are the boss of how and to what extent external factors affect who you are. You get to decide whether A) your life is going to be something that just happens to you, or B) something that you're an active participant in.  Hint: even if you trick yourself into thinking it's A, it's really B. It's always B. A is a lie.  Playing the victim or going ""woe is me, life is hard"" is your choice. These events didn't make you a victim. Bad luck didn't make you a victim. Your mindset did.   Now that said, yes, depression and other mental ailments will make it harder to feel in control. Depression especially has this fun way of taking all of the fun out of taking responsibility for your own reactions to things. It can be hard. But damnit, it's not impossible. You can still take responsibility for your outward reactions to things, even if the chemicals in your brain aren't letting you feel it on the inside. You can still choose to say ""hey, check it, I've got this cool sleep robot, and every night I'm part cyborg"" instead of ""how terrible is my life that I have to deal with this CPAP machine."" That's your choice dude. The more you spin it in a positive way, the more that positivity starts actually changing who you are. Flex that muscle enough and you get strong.  Don't over-analyze the situations you're in. Won't help a bit. Don't sit there and think ""how could this happen to me..."" because that's just more moping. The more you switch that to ""how do I want this to affect my life?"" the more you will start to internalize that control and the more it will have a positive effect on your overall mindset.   You choose how you react to the things that happened to and around you. Your life and who you are will be defined by those choices."

Avoid the blame game in dialogue. You want others to perceive you as the type to own every situation.   There is only one person in this world that both can offer you validation and the only one's who validation actually matters in the long run. And that is the person you see in the mirror.   No one worthwhile respects the victim mentality. They'll either exploit it for personal gain, see you as someone who makes excuses, or use you to justify their own victim mentality.   Don't get too high off compliments and don't get too low on criticisim. Both don't really matter and people offering one will almost always flip flop to the other.   Worry about one person. The person in the mirror. It sounds cliche. I promise you it is not bullshit. Every night before you go to bed If you can look that person in the eyes knowing you tried your best. Knowing you are learning from both of the day's successes and failures. Knowing it will make you a better  person for tomorrow.   You can't bullshit the person in the mirror.

DecidingToBeBetter,334bdx,CreamWafers,3,Mon Apr 20 09:28:38 2015 UTC,"Are you me??  Everything you've said has happened to me.  Hospitalised thrice, depression and anxiety disorders, sleep apnoea.  I attended CBT courses for depression and anxiety, which was a good start. Took me around two years of trying different meds to find ones that work (well, work enough). Lots of psychotherapy from psychiatrist and psychologist, still ongoing work.  I can offer stuff I've learned, but everyone is different! So whatever I say will sound commanding, but I need to be concise, for times sake sorry.  Understand that you're not ""broken"" or need to be ""fixed"". There's just healthy thinking/actions and unhealthy. And it's all very grey, not black and white (either you're this or you're that). So feeling like a victim, what do you think you are a victim of? As that word suggests there are attackers/oppressors. Who are they? If it's yourself, then this is a long hard road. I did and still do this.  CBT starts with examining thoughts, specifically automatic thoughts. Basically, our brains have neuroplasticity and can change. We do this by repetition. An acrobat practises a flip by doing it a million times. This strengthens neuro-pathways. Think of these as roads. By putting yourself down a million times, over time that shitty dirt track becomes a super-highway. Your brain likes to travel down the highway because hey, it's easier. This applies to a wide range of stuff; addiction etc.  Now, you need to develop a skill. This skill is to be aware of what you're thinking. This takes practice in itself! And you need to get better at it. Now, when you think a thought, guess how quickly that thought comes, considering your brain and lightening and stardust and human superpowers and more neurons than galaxies and all that. Pretty quick, right? It's futile to stop it, because it's there before you know it. The trick is to be aware that you thought it. Then you examine it. Challenge it by using logic and better or even just neutral language, such as ""I fucked that up, God I'm such an idiot"" to ""Well ok, that didn't go as well as expected. I'm not an idiot because everyone fucks that up sometimes. I'm not bad at it, I just didn't do that as well as I liked, but I'm still ok etc"" (sorry, shit eg). Then you purposely think that thought again, but think the revised one that is now healthy for you. This will feel stupid at first, but you have to keep doing it until your shitty thoughts become the overgrown dirt track and your new thoughts become the automatic highway. Hard stuff, I know. This is a very concise summary, sorry.  Sleep apnoea: I trialled CPAP but which obviously fixed it, but I couldn't tolerate it and by 3am I was ripping it off me, I felt I couldn't breathe properly or get the humidity setting right. I settled on a mandibular splint, which is basically two mouthguards; one for the top and bottom, which lock your jaw forward, keeping your throat open. The dentist said depending if and how overweight someone is, that it's not recommended or effective for really bad apnoea, but my sleep study went ok with it.  Sleep and mental health is huge. Don't underestimate the effects of sleep! I won't go into details about how to get better sleep. I am still guilty of a few bad habits.  I have what is called an ""unrelenting standards schema"" (amongst other things). So for eg at work, I would work harder and harder and have this perfectionism and was feeling empty. I sought other people's approval and accolades because I wasn't/couldn't pat myself on the back. I brushed off compliments anyway and still focused on the flaws. I wouldn't ""just bask in my own glory"". This is important to take the time to do. Even if it's just for a short time.  Anyway, I hope some of this helps. It strengthens my own knowledge to type this out. And that's all it's about, really. Knowledge. I think they should teach mental ed in schools so adults don't keep becoming unhealthy. A farmer has to learn how to farm and milk cows and build fences and shit before he's a great farmer, so we must learn how to alter our thoughts and then feelings, but we need to learn the science/biochemistry behind it.  One more tidbit: first we have thought, then feelings, then behaviours. You ""mess up"" the thought, you'll have a shitty feeling, then you're behaviour will be unhealthy for you.  There are three things: an event/environment; your cognition/thoughts/behaviour; and then symptoms.  So you ask someone out to dinner, they say no. Event.  You feel down because you think you're unlikeable. Cognition.  Now you're depressed even more and eat a bucket of ice-cream which makes you feel worse so you don't go outside for a week. Symptoms.  You only have control over ONE of these three things. Can you guess? The middle part, cognition.  You ask someone out for dinner. They say no.  You feel down because you think you're unlikeable. You think, wait a minute, I'm likeable. Take these other people for example, they like me just fine. Maybe there are other factors I have no idea about because I'm not a mind reader. Maybe they have other stuff going on with them. Not over their ex? Their dad just died? They don't do ""dinner""? They help the homeless at night? You caught them off guard? They don't like you that way because they are just one in millions who don't like everybody that way? Now you don't feel so bad. Or at least you've challenged your shitty, unhelpful thoughts.  You're a bit deflated, but you can still do something else that's fun that night.  TL;DR: You do it to yourself, you do. And that's what really hurts."
DecidingToBeBetter,334bdx,SunMoonTruth,2,Sun Apr 19 22:03:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, well said. That was some intriguing mental health education. This guy is right, OP. No matter what circumstances life gives us, we decide how to react to it. We either fall into a cycle of self-pity, or we break that mental habit and choose to change ourselves for the better.  You're not alone, /r/Bdi89. And most especially you're not ranked among everyone else who have their own problems.   We think we are victims because we compare ourselves with others too often and accept defeat.  And for you and me, we don't want to accept defeat. It's too easy. Life is hard because it forces us to grow up, take responsibility, and accept reality.   Our goal is to have our happiness become equal with reality. And assuming you are young like me (19), we have plenty of time to grow up and continue trying better each and every fucking day to escape being a victim and become who we truly want to be.   As a last note, I'd like to leave this blog link http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html. In a nutshell it gives an analogy with our life in weeks. Each week is a .05k carrot diamond and our entire lives on average fit in a tablespoon.  It's up to you how what to bring to life each day, week, month, year to break the victim mentality."

The problem for me has been that usually my free sessions have run out before we get really into the swing of it (6 free sessions with a psychologist here in Australia), and I haven't really pursued it much online with self-help. Maybe ego plays a part in that there ('Í'm a psych student/ work in human services, I know better or at least should').  Thanks though for promting me again on what I already knew but never really put into practice myself, about the automacity of thought and behaviour. I tried shifting this a bit with meditation and exercise etc, but was never disciplined enough for the former, which is a shame because I think alongside the rational cognitive elements of assessing the thoughts and consequences of environment and behaviour, meditation can open up a space for that awareness. I will try getting back into it with more of an open mind I think. What I touched on with the dualistic nature of high perfectionism and low self-esteem were what really opened my eyes. I think I too suffer from unrealistically high standards that I can't actually live up to, knowing full well this is the fact but still beating myself up over it.  I think sleep and sleep apnea are hugely tied into it. I can't seem to get more than a couple of hours lying there without ripping it off or wanting to. I'm worried about the dental option in terms of affordability, but it might pay off in the long run if I'm using it more. How does it feel? Is it more comfortable than CPAP?  We sound eerily similar, actually. Thanks for your lengthy and well-thought response. I really do need to revisit alot of the CBT stuff. I'm going to dive into a book called The Happiness Trap, which is based on ACT and mindfulness which I'm really into."
DecidingToBeBetter,334bdx,chasingbunnies,3,Mon Apr 20 09:59:33 2015 UTC,"Hello. I have also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, been hospitalized for it once. I sometimes have the problem you speak of and here are a few of the things that help to put the situation in perspective. Sorry if anything seems cheesy as I am not really planning this out.   Reject the concept of blame. Unhappiness stems from countless factors - short-term, long-term, animal, mineral, vegetable. You could put the blame on anything if you were creative enough. You might blame yourself and your ""victim mindset,"" which is what you're doing right now. It's better not to worry about that. Especially when fighting depression, unhappiness becomes a comfort zone and analyzing the causes of suffering just makes it too tempting to retreat back into that zone. Doesn't matter what caused the problem, you are Deciding To Be Better and that's all that matters. You can acknowledge the severity of your past sufferings without feeling like a victim. There was this girl in my psych ward who had been through a great deal of abuse. When asked for a ""positive message"" during group, she said ""Think of it this way: you're not a victim, you're a survivor."" Acknowledge that shitty stuff has happened to you and be proud that you're still standing. You don't have to think of starving homeless kids, you don't have to berate yourself for not being grateful enough, you don't have to force a smile. You have a right to be unhappy as well as the strength to become happier. If you're strong enough to have made it this far, you'll be able to improve things. Be kind to yourself without focusing on yourself. It's hard for me to put this right because there is a fine line between what I'm trying to say and some tough-love ""stop being such a navel-gazer"" bullshit. I guess the idea is to pay attention to what things you like, what things bring happiness (even if it is a small whisper of it). You might be into a certain TV show for instance. It can be little things at first, then maybe you might get really into a sport, maybe painting. Either way you make certain habits that are personally gratifying. This detracts from your identity as a victim, and gives you a new identity as a painter, sport player, fan of a certain TV show. Define yourself by what you do, not what has been done to you. Similarly, your interactions with others should be based on something other than validation-seeking. Find which people you admire or respect, and the qualities you appreciate in them.   I understand that having depression mucks this up a lot. Hell, depression isn't a way of seeing the world - it's a whole different world to live in. In fact what you describe as a victim mindset sounds like just another manifestation of depression to me. You're fighting it though. This makes small victories valuable. Any progress is good."
DecidingToBeBetter,334bdx,shamelessnameless,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:41:44 2015 UTC,"*Very true. I have a huge tendency to blame my own victim mentality yet do little to work on changing it. And you're right, I'm sick of overanalysing about what led me here, why I can't seem to get better. I just want to start acting and behaving more self-compassionately. * That point particularly resonates with me. Feeling ungrateful for what I have can often send me into feelings of guilt and push me back instead of forward, it's part of that world of depression. * I've already been trying this out with myself by getting back into the gym, picking up bass guitar and other stuff. Again, feeling like a perfectionist often makes these things more of a chore at times, but im trying to be mindful of that and just enjoy it. * This is one reason I have largely cut out toxic people, party animals and drama llamas from my life.   Thanks for your kind words. Really, I know I can be better, and I dont feel physically the effects of depression (thanks medication) but I still really need to dig deep and work on the cognitive side of things. Thanks."

""the alternative would be unlivable.""  For me I decided then and there, reliving my mistakes was making my immediate life unbearable and that I was doing it to myself.

DecidingToBeBetter,334mz3,T_Rasa,24,Sun Apr 19 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"Nothing you've described sounds like narcissistic behaviour. In fact, everything you've described is fairly normal, and even positive behaviour: studying harder so that you can do better than someone else at a subject that's important to you is a healthy response. Zoning out sometimes when someone talks isn't the most polite thing ever, but we all do it sometimes, I wouldn't worry about it. And attention-seeking is not in and of itself a bad thing, again, we all do it, it's only a problem if it becomes destructive, which isn't something you seem to be describing.  It's good that you're trying to be self-aware and examine your own behaviour. It's a positive thing to try to step outside yourself and see what you are doing from an objective standpoint. What I see, though, from your description, is normal, healthy behaviour."
DecidingToBeBetter,334mz3,heartspackle,7,Sun Apr 19 15:47:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, I am 16 and used to be anxious about this as well. My advice would be to relax and focus on something else, like playing Civ for instance. Everything you describe sounds quite normal, except how upset it makes you.  Narcissists tend to obsess and overthink on behalf of their egos. In this case, by worrying that you are a narcissist, you are working against yourself. I remember noticing this and getting extremely frustrated about it. Funny how ""I want myself to be less narcissistic"" is a paradox.  The only way out is to notice when the unfavorable moments like you described happen, try to act differently, and let it pass when you fuck up instead of dwelling on it. When zoning out of a conversation, don't ask yourself ""Aren't you being selfish by not listening?"" Instead ask yourself, ""Isn't there something important they might be saying that you should know?""  Another simple example, you have a hat on and are heading into a friend's house. You don't think ""I should take off my hat because I want to feel like a respectful person"" but ""My friend's parents would appreciate me taking my hat off as a sign of respect.""  But overall, just try to be calm about it. Give yourself a break. This is the kind of issue that goes away if you deprive it of attention. Easier said than done, but I think you can do it.  Edit: a word"

Everybody has a few narcissistic tendencies, especially teens, and if it doesn't hurt others and it helps you establish your identity, it's no worry. If you want to be better, just be nice to others, especially when you don't have to be, and don't lie."
DecidingToBeBetter,334mz3,wearebornfree,5,Sun Apr 19 16:06:27 2015 UTC,That's just being 15. It is normal. Don't worry about it.   Start to worry when you are out of college and still acting that way despite negative consequences those actions cause you.
DecidingToBeBetter,334mz3,ChagSC,3,Sun Apr 19 17:06:54 2015 UTC,"From a personality disorder perspective, you exhibit qualities that are more histrionic than narcissistic. Narcissism is more centered around a grandiose self image where histrionic behavior is more about the need to be the center of attention. However, I do not believe you should be diagnosed with either.  It's great that you recognize that you have some attention seeking qualities that may be a bit over the top. Maybe you should practice taking a step back from each situation and notice when it is appropriate to act. Stopping impulsive behavior can also stop attention seeking behavior too."
DecidingToBeBetter,334mz3,presley250,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:52:39 2015 UTC,"Well, it sounds like you know your ""problems"" (not all are necessarily bad from time to time however). If you want to change just start listening to people, laying low, and admitting that there will always be someone better than you. Nothing wrong with any of the things you've mentioned as long as you keep those tendencies under control. Everyone loves themselves, sometimes seeks attention, competes, etc. Narcissists just do those things to extremes that hurt other people."

However, simply disregarding your own level of interest in order to listen to someone go on and on is not necessarily ""good"", some others are not able to read social signals that they are carrying on too long.  Also perhaps you lost interest because you weren't getting a chance to be active in the conversation, which is supposed to be an exchange between people, not one way.  Finally, you are an age where your brain and emotional skills are still developing.  Some of this will occur naturally with maturing.   You can also seek role models whose values you respect and try to add their good qualities to your life."

DecidingToBeBetter,334mz3,Devvils,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:45:40 2015 UTC,"Egocentrism:       Egocentrism is the inability to differentiate between self and other.    Although egocentrism and narcissism appear similar, they are not the same. A person who is egocentric believes they are the center of attention, like a narcissist, but does not receive gratification by one's own admiration. A narcissist is a person whose ego is greatly influenced by the approval of others while an egotist is not. Similarly, egocentrism and absolutism appear to be the same but are not.  Egocentrism and absolutism differ in the sense that an egotist's opinion must always allow everything to center around themselves, while an absolutist can form an opinion that does not center themselves, yet believes their idea and opinion is non contest. [citation needed] Although egocentric behaviors are less prominent in adulthood, the existence of some forms of egocentrism in adulthood indicates that overcoming egocentrism may be a lifelong development that never achieves completion.

So don't worry if you may be a narcissist or whatever instead, I feel that being a narcissist is a great reason to love yourself more because you love yourself so much already and theres loads of depressed people who cant even feel that way! Just dont forget about the golden rule: treat others as you wish to be treated...  so when someone calls you mental or you feel mental, you know you're just feeling mental... but you know you're probably just feeling a bit down. Of course, if you ever consider going to a psych... it's a darn good idea regardless. going there doesnt make you crazy ;) you go there to check, and if you are they help you!  uhhhhh also good advice for myself hahaha"

That initially sounds scary in combination with what you said about getting thrilled by the worst outcomes in life, but I think you just find bad things fascinating. That is normal to a small extent and might be exacerbated by your depression.  I'm sure your psychologist will be suggesting some kind of treatment, but what would perhaps be best is for you to interact with a lot more people. Try to focus on the good attributes of people you meet (be aware of the bad ones but don't get carried away). Think how great it would be, if only from a karma perspective, to have tons of people who know that you dealt with them fairly and/or did them a favor.

It's great (and nothing to be ashamed of) that you're seeing a psychologist right now. I know for a fact that you aren't alone.  Baby steps are definitely the best way to approach ""learning"" positive emotions. Of course your psychologist is best to listen to, but maybe you could find an emotional role model and compare how the ""genuine"" positive behaviors they exhibit may be different from the fake ones that you behave. Maybe even ask reddit why they feel how they feel.  For example, I genuinely feel happy when I give food to the homeless because I have created a tangible, assured impact on their life. Since they received a meal they probably wouldn't have gotten otherwise, it makes me feel like a good person to have literally contributed to their life. No denial that it is egotistical, but in the end, I feel happy for me, not necessarily for them."

So in this sense if animal agriculture was taken off the menu- and animals were not specifically bred and farmed in mass for our consumption, you would be saving a lot of plant/water consumption that could go towards feeding the world's poorest.   For example 5% of water consumer in the US is by private homes, whilst 55% of water consumed in the US is for animal agriculture. In terms of your Californian case study on average Californians use 1500 gallons of water per person, per day.

But the question is, would humans eat/consume less than farmed animals. Somehow, I'm not so sure this would be the case.  Also, if you are going with the ""reduce strain on the environment"" angle, better options would be: 1. Kill yourself (reduces your usage/strain to 0) or 2. Consume only minimal-resource food, like Soylent and the equivalents.  In order to keep your actions consistent with your views, you must also stop using virtually every product on the market. Given that every product has some sort of animal involved in the process, and every product has a negative effect on the environment (with the exception of recycled things, which originate from things that do).   For example 5% of water consumer in the US is by private homes, whilst 55% of water consumed in the US is for animal agriculture.   Source please?

Close to half of this is associated with meat and dairy products as 2 500 gallons of water alone is needed to produce only 1 pound of beef.   If you say that a person's water usage is including the usage to make the meat/dairy products, how do you incorporate the fact that a single animal can provide food for multiple people? Could you again source these numbers?  All in all, you are certainly right in the general idea. I just don't think that a few individuals switching to a vegan diet is going to help. At all. And instead of pushing for just ""no meat/dairy"" the better push would be to the conclusion: something like soylent (which, yes, is now vegan). Granted, soylent still uses resources, but the idea is to ultimately make food from water/light (or other easily renewable resources).  Ultimately, I don't see how any particular individual switching their food choices will help at all. You'd need massive shifts, and before that you'd need markets and store owners to stop buying/serving the stuff. As I see it, stores will have the products in stock whether I personally buy them or not. Might as well enjoy them."

This isn't an insult. It's a cold, hard fact.   I am a talented artist but rarely end up making anything.   Then you're not an artist.  If you don't write, you're not a writer. If you don't sculpt, you're not a sculptor. If you don't mine coal, you're not a coal miner. If you do not do the thing that defines you as a member of a group -- in this case, creating art -- then you're not a member of that group. Don't treat creativity as a special case. You have to put the work in, because ideas aren't worth shit without the effort that it takes to do something with them. If they were, novels would be just as short as the blurb on their back cover.  Whether you consider that as being worth making time for... well, that's up to you. Personally, I think it is, and I think it's important to put the effort in -- but make no mistake about it, the value is in the end result, not in the half-formed imaginings. Every picture is perfect until the paint hits the canvas, after all."

If the idea is a big project, I'll figure out what the next thing to do is, however small, and either do it immediately or put it on my projects list.  I just read the book ""The Checklist Manifesto"" and can recommend that too.  Take all your projects, write them down, and get all your ideas out of your head. Then do little things to get them done.

In Australia we don't have an internship but we do have a mentor year. However, there are literally no jobs in dietetics, a few casual hours here or there. Like you I don't really enjoy it either. I was interested in nutrition which is why I enrolled in the degree, but I'm no longer interested. I'm also stuck in a low lying dead end Job in an unrelated field. Tonight I've been research appropriate masters that I can enrol in.

At the same time, I almost applied to do my MBA, and even almost applied to law school. Until I came across a site from a University that saved me from spending all this money and going down a path I would have not enjoyed.   What the site said was... why do you want to get your law degree? People applying for their law degree need to ask themselves, doing this degree is going to bring me to this ""specific position"" or help me do ""specific role in life"". If you don't know the answer to that question, don't do your law degree.   And it was sooo right!! I had no idea really what exactly I wanted out of it, nor did I even know if that was going to be what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.   What I ended up doing is making life a study. I figured out my strength, who I was (Myers Briggs test etc..), and started studying Life (Happiness, Wealth, Habits, Psychology etc...). This led me to find a job that would help provide me with the transferable skills that I needed in Life no matter what I ended up doing in the end. I figured out how to make myself more valuable to the marketplace and haven't stopped since.   Anyways to your actual question.  I'm curious.. what's the worst that can happen if you decide to move forward? and what's the consequences if you don't move forward? in other words.. what do you have to lose if you decide to move forward?

If you currently have no debt and you have almost $10k in the bank, you're doing a hell of a lot better than most. So keep that in mind.  Don't get caught up thinking about buying a house. Houses are not a measure of success. They are a place to keep your shit. Depending on your situation, it may not be in your best interest to buy a house. They may be too expensive in your area, and they tie you down to a certain area. There's nothing at all wrong with renting or having roommates.   What is it that you like about your current job? If it's selling things, then get a job selling more expensive things and making commission. If it's managing people, then get a job managing more people who do deal with more important things. There might not be a similar job that pays more, but if there is, go for it.  I don't think that your problem is being afraid to do something. I think that you don't have a good plan in place. It doesn't seem like you have any plan at all, really. Make a plan and know exactly where you should be in 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years.

It wasn't malicious, they just didn't realize your your past experiences made you react badly to that joke. They aren't being affectionate? They still love you but had a bad day and want to shake it off so as to not ruin your day too.   When I've had this mindset I've found that we fight less and enjoy each other's company more."
DecidingToBeBetter,32wjgf,bluebuckeye,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:00:53 2015 UTC,"It's hard to give general advice...I find it good to reflect on certain situations that went poorly and figure out what I could have done differently to make things go smoother. It takes a lot of self-reflection and work at understanding yourself. Sometimes I find I was angry only because my s/o pointed out something that I already thought about myself, but didn't want to give voice to.   Also, like anything, practice. Unpredictable situations can arise and you can't be prepared for everything. Just try to create space between your thoughts and your actions, so you're not reacting without considering the other's feelings. Interpersonal relationships are one of the biggest life challenges we all face. You can even practice the same principle with your friends. There are things unique to romantic relationships, but many of the same ideas apply. Good luck!"
DecidingToBeBetter,32wjgf,yeadoge,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"Conflict can be an irritant in relationships. I'll tell you what's a bigger irritant -- giving in to the other person's wants.   Half of the time, others are acting out of what they think they want, of what society has told them they want, and so they're not acting congruently with their own needs. When you give in to someone's needs that you don't respect, when you meet someone halfway when you don't respect where they're coming from, you lose self-respect. Know that you can stop, pivot on a dime, and walk away without looking back when you are disrespected strongly enough. Make sure your partner knows this too. It sets a strong boundary. Everyone loves boundaries."

Granted both are from Christian (I am not Christian) writers but I like what they talk about. In summary of both - learning what unhealthy things you do that sabotage relationships and figuring out what the other person needs to feel loved.

I think one of the better pieces of advice I've ever received is around descalating angry situations before they irrevocably break things. You can really destroy a lot of good things with one shitty out of control argument."

For instance, I joined a running club and from that other social activities occurred. When I was deep in my depression I isolated myself. It made me feel like I must be an introvert. Now that I have events to look forward to with other smiling people, the depression has started to become a distant memory and I find that group activity invigorates me. We are social creatures and I found I was able to crawl out of the depression when I surrounded myself with people who liked the same activities as me. That and lots of therapy and meds! 😉"

I like the idea of joining clubs etc., and would really like to but I feel like I have virtually no passions right now. I am a beginner almost everything, and don't even really know what I like yet. And it's becoming a matter of switching my brain to ""go"" mode. I can't seem to understand how to decide what to do with my time, like I'm completely dry of any idea that won't make my life boring, mundane and repetitive. I've tried looking into things that spark my interest, but I'm having a hard time diving in because I feel like I'm just not even used to concentrating and continuing to do things because with depression I did nothing but work and sit on my couch and sleep."

Those words of infinite wisdom are, ""the only thing that separates you from the next person is your mindset."" Now, I'm not telling you what to do or how to achieve happiness; to be straightforward with you, words are wind unless proven otherwise. However, with that in mind, I would not be where I am today without that advice. Regardless of how you start your day, the end of your day (and your life) depends on how you choose to end it.

DecidingToBeBetter,32ttme,ColorBlindPanda,25,Sat Apr 18 16:14:51 2015 UTC,"One of the most important things for me was accepting that depression will stay with me, but that it doesn't control me. I've been ""recovered"" for a few years now, but I still have what I call ""depressive days."" Here are a few things that have helped me build a life I love:   Look up free events in your town. I joined a meditation group, started volunteering, and took a beginner's swing dancing class; all of it free, and all of it fun. Plan things with people. Be a social organizer. This one took me way out of my comfort zone, but it's made a huge difference. Just text people you know and say ""Hey, want to get lunch this week?"" and we'll just talk. If you don't know people... Be direct about friendship. When you enjoy talking to someone, say ""Hey, it was great to meet you, let's swap contact info and get lunch sometime."" Or anything similar. Figure out what you want to talk about, and bring it up. I have a few conversation routines I can fall back on and that is incredibly helpful. Basic stuff like ""What do you do?"" followed by ""Do you like it?"" or ""How did you get into that?"" See a therapist. If you already are, don't stop just because you're ""better"" now. Therapy is a turbocharger for self-improvement of any kind.  Embarrass yourself deliberately. For a long time I would go up to strangers and say ""Hey, I start one random conversation every day, how's it going?"" Sometimes it was awkward, sometimes it sucked, but it got me used to the feeling of being a bit of a weirdo, and no one ever got offended or creeped out, because they had an immediate response, ""What on earth possessed you to do that?"" Lots of good stories from that one.   In short, I figured out who I wanted to be by trying to be a lot of different people."

Like for example, I'm always scared to invite new friends out to hang out from fear f 1) awkward conversations and 2) them knowing I'm trying to be their friend. I don't really know why it's a fear.   I really like these ideas, do you think maybe if I do just one of any of these on my day off (so twice a week) that would be enough? I don't want to go overboard, that scares the fuck out f me and is guaranteed to make me never do it again. But if only doing stuff twice a week is too little, that's also shitty. I feel shitty."
DecidingToBeBetter,32ttme,morton_luthor,9,Thu Apr 16 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely just doing one is fine. I didn't mean to imply you need to start doing all of these at once! I've built up that list over the last 4 years. It takes time.  Start with baby steps. Pick the least scary one and remember that success = trying. As long as you try, you're succeeding."
DecidingToBeBetter,32ttme,morton_luthor,6,Thu Apr 16 18:58:24 2015 UTC,"I've been doing baby steps for a couple months, like reaching out but I do this thing where I'll try for a day and then give up for a few weeks and try again, so I haven't seen much progress. Maybe I'll make a list of three things I want to improve. Like improve my friendships with people so once a wee hang out with someone. And I want to learn a skill, so maybe one a week work on learning about it? I know it takes time, I just kind of want to skip to the middle where  I know enough not to get bored, scared or burnt out. I've never really been able to stick with something once trying it for a few weeks. Idk what to do about that."
DecidingToBeBetter,32ttme,morton_luthor,6,Thu Apr 16 19:07:33 2015 UTC,"Focus is definitely important. I like the idea of picking three things, because then if one of them is giving you trouble you have two others things you can work on and keep feeling like you're making progress. That feeling of progress is very important to staying positive.  One alternative to baby steps is taking a leap of faith. Like when I tried to start a conversation with someone new every single day. I didn't do it every day, but because I was aiming high, I did it a couple times a week. If I set the goal of doing it a couple times a week, I'd do it maybe every other week. And so on. The upside of the leap of faith is that you see results sooner. The harder road is the shorter road, as the saying goes, so you can get the discomfort out of the way all at once, and get to that middle part sooner. You might also get burned out if you try to do too much at once.  Think of this part of your life as learning about yourself and how you grow. You're trying all these different ways of improving yourself and seeing what works for you, and what doesn't. If you keep getting burned out, you may just need a new angle. As long as you keep trying, you'll find it."
DecidingToBeBetter,32ttme,morton_luthor,7,Thu Apr 16 19:15:45 2015 UTC,"I like that idea! It would be hard to tell myself ""do it every day"" and then not and not beat myself up, but maybe my goal will e to do all three things every day and settle for less because goals aren't mandatory, only suggestions. or maybe one out of the three once a day? It's weird thinking of it this way than every other way I did before with depression. I really want to learn but I get bored and lazy quickly because I'm not used to focusing or even believing I' capable of anything extraordinary."

Originally, there was this terror and piss-in-your-pants-fear of looking foolish, or ""whatever"" from speaking in front of others. Consequently, I strongly recommend Toastmasters to get over that fear. I was lucky in that I had a job that required speaking in front of others - so I got paid to get over that fear.   Lately (like the last year), the thing that gets me out of my comfort zone is group dancing classes. In most of my classes, I am the least competent dancer. In most of those classes, I'm the only guy."

Another thing was never blaming myself for being silent, and not allowing myself to think people would judge me for it. This means I can enter a conversation after 5 or 10 minutes without feeling awkward for having waited so long. Another thing that really gets me going is trusting myself. Whereas before I would try to compose really good or convincing sentences in my head so people would like me and be impressed, I just jump into a conversation and a social setting, trust myself and try and pick up on people's cues. I smile, make eye contact and ask when I don't understand, I am done trying to make an impression."

Idk, I guess my biggest problem is I can try and put myself out there but ideas to do it I have no idea how. I work with people every day and practice my social skills there, but home alone my mind feels blank and I have trouble searching for ANYTHING to do or where to begin or what. Or just anything that I would like or enjoy. I have no idea, I'm so lost. I don't have many fiends any more and most have drifted away from depression. I'm just starting to get to know my coworkers. I don't know much about what's going on around my city or fun things to do during your spare time. I don't have many passions and if I do they are just budding and I want to develop them but again it's hard to start when this is an entirely new concept that you don't grasp yet. What do I do to put myself out there in a way that I will want to continue doing it?  I like your conversation ideas! I definitely do what you did. I want to make a list of all the silent, fake rules I make for myself and try and stop beating myself up over them or get scared to do something because of them. I'm letting it rule my life."
DecidingToBeBetter,32ttme,yourmatchmyfire,4,Thu Apr 16 18:22:30 2015 UTC,"Actually it took me a while to figure those things out, trial and error mostly. I am now convinced that most people are just waiting for someone to break the ice and to show interest in them to open up. By doing this consistently, you are bound to meet people that share your views and interests, or with whom you just 'click'.  If you are not sure what interests you, just go for as many things as possible. In the past I felt like I had no real personality, no interests, nothing really that seemed to define me. Then I just tried out a bunch of different things, it takes a bit of pushing at first, but once you get there you just got to take a deep breath and realize you came all the way there, so you might as well go for it. Today after work I decided to go to a lecture about magical realism in Latin-American literature. Turns out I read it wrong, it was actually some sort of workshop, and the craziest part was that it was happening in Spanish. At first I thought ""wow wow wow no way, I am not comfortable with this"". But I decided to fuck it and stick with it anyway, at first I was really silent, listening and smiling, then some guy started talking to me, shook my hand, smiled and said ""you don't talk a lot"", so I smiled back and said my Spanish wasnt that great. This kind of gave me the nudge I needed to open up, some more people struck up conversations with me and before I knew it we were all chatting and having a good time. Right now my best assets are eye contact and showing interest. I have been told I have an open face, people always feel comfortable asking me for directions on the street, which is a change from before. So I guess my bottomline is, don't try to jump too many steps, be comfortable with yourself, with the fact that you are undergoing a constant process of change for the better, be willing to try things out, accept the fact that you can be silent at times."

Another Redditor suggested making a goal of doing something every day that will get me closer to my goals, but not to beat myself up if I don't do it every single day. I made a little list of things I want to do every day (Yoga for ten minutes, meditation for ten minutes, make or eat at least one meal a day, tidy one thing) and a few optional fun things I can pick to do once a day too (see friends, learn more about traveling, practice drawing), so maybe that will work?

I used to be part of a drama group, it also made me get out of my comfort zone. I still spend loads of time on my own, but now I do it because I enjoy my own company.

I'll try to put words to what I've done to exist in my post-depression world.  Say ""yes"" to (within reason) to everything. Someone invites you somewhere but you're not entirely sure if you'd like it, or maybe you're pretty sure you wouldn't like it? Agree to go anyway. The big thing I found that was holding me back was thinking I didn't like x, y, and z because I'd never liked it before. However, that was when I was depressed, and I didn't like anything then! You've got a new mindset now and you should see what that new mindset enjoys.  When I stopped being depressed, I found my productivity and dedication to my work skyrocketed. I would not mind so much to work on my work for university or my job. I'd also get it done faster, giving me time for hobbies. Similarly with what I said above, try everything. See what the new you enjoys, because it is almost certain that you'll find a hobby you love.   I suppose in general, try everything again. Act as though you've never tried anything before, because in a sense you haven't. The way I see it, you wouldn't say ""I hate playing tennis, I never want to play it again"" when the only time you played you had broken arms or legs. It's as if now you can try things without a huge block in the way of you enjoying it.  I hope this made sense, friend.

Most helpful is to be doing things...hobbies you enjoy, time spent with friends, taking steps to better your life one day at a time. Improving health too like eating better, working out, keeping drinking moderate etc all give you more confidence and you realize slowely that things are in fact getting better. Believe me I COMPLETELY understand the blank 'where do I even start' feeling and have discovered that sitting alone mulling it over in my head...over and over just leads to a mess.

I stayed off Facebook, deleted people from Facebook who I didn't like seeing, I stopped watching depressing television (love Futurama for happy TV), got more active (started walking to work, parking far from the door of places I was trying to go, running with my dog, etc). Maybe the most important thing I did was make a commitment to myself to always do the right thing.  I tried to be nicer and more thoughtful (and succeeded). I tried to be more outgoing and social (not really my schtick, but I tried). I started sending postcards, people love postcards.  I decided to make my life more about other people and less about myself. Doing the right for the sake of doing the right thing was helpful. An attitude of active resilience changed my life: battle back against depression, you only lose if you don't fight.  Watch the ""This is water"" speech by David Foster Wallace."

For a while music made me want to vomit and yell at shit. Depression is so weird. It  gave me this weird sensory disorder where sometimes I faint if I don't life the way things sound or feel or look. Whatever. So that's started to get a bit better too because my brain isn't all confused and overloaded as is. I found out that my favorite genre is rap, of all things."
DecidingToBeBetter,32ttme,AerinHawk,2,Fri Apr 17 06:26:13 2015 UTC,"The realisation that whatever triggered it, genetics, environment, stress etc, depression and anxiety are on a continuum that we all experience, regardless of diagnosis or lack thereof. You don't necessarily have to experience severe depression all the time (some do, Major Depressive Disorder), nor anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) or even psychosis (manic states in Bipolar I, Schizophrenia/Schizoaffective Disorder). I've experienced anxiety and depression for years on varying ends on what feels like a continuum. Being realistic and being about managing the two instead of magically wishing for an outright cure have helped a lot. As has meditation, exercise, eating healthy, medication - when I can remember to do all or even some of them regularly! Social support is massive too, as other people have echoed in this thread."
DecidingToBeBetter,32ttme,reeblebeeble,2,Sat Apr 18 14:22:06 2015 UTC,"Well... That's true for you but my situation is different. I think you might be mistaken in assuming I diagnosed myself with this remission, but I promise I had several doctors give me the official mental health diagnosis. While I understand depression is not chemical often, it was the route of my depression as a child. And while yes, there is along road as far as non-chemical therapy is concerned, it is very different noticing the difference between, non chemical and chemical depression.Both are equally valid, though chemical is a bit more tricky when it comes to controlling it mentally. So, while I have symptoms of depression, my brain chemistry has literally changed and it feel sgood to think this way effortlessly. There is no magic cure, that was the opposite of my point in this thread. I have ""cured"" myself of chemical depression, now it is time to tackle the habits it left."

There is a hugely genetic and chemical basis to my mental health issues, as is most people's. In fact, it is almost categorically impossible not to have a chemical depression... you can have neurotransmitters that are back in good balance but still be sufferinga lot of the behavioural and cognitive challenges with negative thoughts etc.   Im not implying you self diagnosed and I'm not trying to insinuate it can just up and leave. The point I was aiming for is it's something that will need to be managed and controlled, for good, even if only to help prevent relapsing into future episodes. The whole diet exercise and sleep triad of advice is so overused and kitsch it hurts to hear. But IME and that of others,  really investing into each and being strongly consistent will work wonders."
DecidingToBeBetter,32ttme,Devvils,2,Sat Apr 18 14:13:47 2015 UTC,"With me, i started completely fresh. I abandoned the old friends at first and changed who i was. i picked up the very first thing that sparked my interest which was oddly... dancing with the stars while i lay moping on the couch too lazy to get up and change the channel. I went on Groupon on my family comp, took a salsa class, found some tango peeps, and started dancing. i stuck to it for a few months, then i contacted my old friends and caught up.  i was real with them. told them I had a depression issue and it never came up again. i literally snapped my phone in half because i didnt want to talk to anyone during this period.  I think the major point that i learned about me was pick something and stick to it, no matter how lame or stupid it is. I'm not as big into dancing as i used to be, but i am really thankful for it because it gave me structure and reason to go somewhere.  Also, shoutout to my friend who came knocking at my door because he was worried. Shit woulda been a lot worse if he didnt do that.  thats what worked for me at least  TL:DR pick something no matter how lame and stick to it. once you get into that routine,  then you can act normal with your friends again.  edit: sorry i wrote this before i read your responses to others. but it sounds like you're on the right track when it comes to trying new things and becoming normal.  another thing that worked for me is just reprogramming my mentalities by rephrasing my mind. Like rephrasing ""i can't because blah blah"" to ""blah blah is challenging me to""   i hope that helped.  anyways. thank you for posting this, ranting about how i improved myself is cathartic and helping me be more productive.

When that happens, I have to get up and do something. If I don't, the situation gets worse, and I do things I end up regretting or get suicidal, etc....  Think of things you should get done, even if they're boring or unpleasant, and it will feel so much better to be doing something than sitting and staring at the wall. And from there, if you have any impetus to do something, even a small one, do it! If you want to write, write a short story. If you feel restless, go for a run. So on and so forth.

There is nothing wrong with YOU! You are ENOUGH just the way you ARE.  From what you write, it sounds like you were severely oppressed for a long time. You had to learn to isolate yourself as a defense mechanism against things that happened in your childhood. You were not born depressed, you were made depressed.  I've been there. I tried ""being like normal people"" for two decades. I finally overcame all my depression when I realized that I WAS NEVER THE PROBLEM. To really heal, I started collecting a few people around me who make me feel like I'm part of humanity. There are plenty of them, but you won't find them if you keep thinking there's something wrong with you.  In my case, I suffered a physically and emotionally abusive mother, and an emotionally absent and verbally abusive father for most part of my life. They see their children as their possession to do with them as they please. I almost instantly healed my depression when I realized they were doing all the damage, not me.   I divorced my parents, cut emotional ties and cut social ties with them. For a few days I felt lost, but then magic happened: my long oppressed personality suddenly awoke. Confidence came back to me with force like the Three Gorges Dam burst.   You have to find out what made you depressed in the first place, and get away from it. Sorry to tell you, but in most cases of childhood depression, it really is the parents. This may be difficult to accept at first, but it's the only way. Most such parents never come around, it's pointless to try to change them."

I was soooo dysfunctionally shy as a child, but I figured it was sink or swim, so I constantly put myself in uncomfortable social situations, and eventually got really good at it.  I literally faked it until I made it.  I had been a bartender into my mid twenties and I thought I had women and dating pretty much totally figured out.  It wasn't until I took a job selling pest control door-to-door in a state 2000 miles from my home that I REALLY figured it out.  It's simple: life is a numbers game.  I can tell you with almost absolute certainty that someone in a given area is willing to sign a $600 pest control contract; you just have to knock on enough doors and someone will eventually let you in.  This is the law of averages, and it applies to dating too.  Just start talking to girls, even the not-so pretty ones, and don't shit on yourself for getting shut down; instead, even if you piss yourself and stumble over your words, at least you fucking tried, and that's what matters.  You'll get better at it over time until one day it's second nature.  I'm still a bartender and still the same introverted kid at heart, but now I surprise myself sometimes at how easily I'm able to relate to other people. It's all just practice.  Oh, one last thing, a piece of advice given to me by an older friend in my early teens that has served me well: ""Be nice to the fat chicks; they might have cute friends."""

Also, listen to more fun, dancey music and avoid slow depressing ones. Music helps set your mood. This will surely help boost confidence and your ability to be more enthusiastic.

I was pretty introverted too in school, and still am a bit, but its much easier now.    Before I technically started my first job out of college, the company had a 'party' where all the new hires were invited too.  I was nervous as hell but sucked it up and just went, and made an actual effort to talk to some people.  Ended up meeting a friend who I still hang out with 20 years later.  It wouldn't have happened if I had convinced myself not to go.    As far as the girls go, look at it this way:  EVERY girl you do not talk to is an automatic rejection (because you'll never get to know her).  At least some of the girls you do actually talk to will be willing to get to know you a little more.  The best pick up artists?  They still get rejected a majority of the time.  They just are a little better at it, and they talk to LOTS of girls."

If you are studying at University level a year or even a term abroad can be good and will throw you into a situation with new people.  Depending on how country you are sites like meetup can plug you into groups that are not sports related.  You can also do a summer working in different countries which is good.  Basically you need to find ways to maximise meeting people in the real world, part time employment can be an easy way.  I would also say there is nothing wrong with gaming but it's not the best topic in social situations.    Tinder or similar apps are good for getting out and meeting people  in a  dating environment, in gives you practice to develop a little chat, but in general just being interested in what the other person has to say is a start.  Photography is a good type of hobby to talk about in this type of thing.   There are a bunch of sub reddits that are good for picking up tips on being better."

This would be a much better solution IMHO for meeting a group of people where you could build stable lasting relationships, rather than getting a date for Friday night, and leaving it at that... =p  I would say start with what interests you, and go from there.  I don't think its possible to be so boring that nothing at all interests you.  You say you like games, go to a gaming meetup... games are a great way to socialize and get practice socializing.

It might take a while, and you might not always notice the progress you're making, but keep it up!  I've found that it sometimes helps to ask, instead of ""What can I do to be a nicer person?"", try saying ""What would someone who is already nice do in this situation?""  Maybe study some examples of good people? You may think it's corny, but try checking out a few episodes of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood for examples!   A more painful thing you may want to consider is breaking away from your current group of friends. I'd guess that they somehow encourage the behavior you're trying to eradicate. Even if they're not, you're used to acting that way in that environment, so it'll be harder to change.  Fake it till you make it. Make an effort to compliment someone each day.

My advice is to take this realization and take it seriously while it is still fresh. Seriously, go into your computer settings and change your password to something like ""IWillBeNiceToPeople"". Trust me, no one likes an asshole and many assholes never realize they are the asshole until something happens. This is a big moment for you and a big step to adulthood. Once you enter the real world where anything goes and people are cruel, your image will determine if they will reject you from society or help you. See how you just lost a friend? Well, she probably told a couple more people behind your back and who knows how far it spread. This could greatly hurt you because imagine all the people that know what happened and now will avoid you. Those potential people could have helped you in some way in the future. Go do some heavy research on how to be a more likable person and take notes.  Enough bashing for now. I wasn't trying to hurt you. As an adult making it on my own, I really want you to realize how grateful you should be for something like this happening to you! Either sit around and feel bad and go into depression or be a FUCKING MAN and go through hell and back to pull that girl you hurt aside and tell her how sorry you are and that you had no right to call her ugly. You destroyed her self esteem and it is your duty to build it back up. Actually, go overboard. Go grab a rose and then pull her aside. 1. Apologize. 2. Tell her you had no right to call her ugly and that you were being an asshole. 3. Tell her she is beautiful person. 4. Ask her how you can make it up to her. BONUS: Show her this post on Reddit you made.  If you don't believe me, switch the situation around and put yourself in her shoes. Wouldn't that change your view? The worst that can happen is she blows you off. Then what? Your image is now the guy who hurt a girl and then tried to apologize for it afterwards.  Either apologize, sit around in depression from your crippled self esteem, or revert back to being an asshole. Choose wisely.   PS: Lemme know which you decide. Thanks."

I agree with this comment and I'm going to re-write it in my own words.  OP, you hurt someone badly (accidentally) and then found out about it and you feel bad about it. You have two choices going forward:   1 Make it about you. 2 Make it about her.    For 1), that means you lie in bed contemplating what a horrible person you are, how much it sucks to have hurt someone accidentally, post on reddit about your sins, and avoid interacting with people because you're a horrible person and you just hurt people and they're better off without you around.   For 2), that means you put yourself in her shoes as best you can, realize that she's a human being with feelings who got hurt, and do your best to fix your mistake WITH HER.  Apologize.  Don't make the apology all about you (""I intended it as a joke and I didn't mean it and I feel awful.."").  Own it, be sincere, and accept that it won't erase the past, but it's what you can do.   Going forward, the way you be a better, nicer person is to think of other people is people.  Consider their feelings. When someone talks to you, do your best to first think about things from their perspective instead of how it applies to you.  When you hurt someone, think about how you can make it better for THEM instead of wallowing.  When you are having a good time, check that other people are having a good time. If you ever listen to gossip about celebrities and such, note that the people who everybody talks about positively, the best kinds of people are not the ones who make a lot of money and look hot and are important, they're the people who help others, who genuinely care about unimportant people, and who make everybody they interact with feel special."

Even if that's not true, sometimes the little lies can do a lot more good than the truth. If you just straight up apologize, she'll still think that's how you really feel and keep internalizing it. That's technically on her to change, yes, but it's hard when you've already got low self esteem."

It's weird but people want to help other people, if you tell her what you've said here, that you're looking for clues on how to not be a fucking dickhead, then she might be able to give you tips, or at the very least, you could ask her to let you know if you do or say something that makes her feel bad etc.  The thing is, I'm guessing you feel like a piece of shit right now because you've seen your reflection (finally) that you've been avoiding for a long time, and just like Dorian Grey finally seeing his demons, it unravels you. It's fucking scary to take an honest look at yourself and anyone who doesn't agree either hasn't looked deeply enough or they have never had to fight for something in their life. Trust me, I've been learning about myself since I was like fucking 11 and I STILL get scared when I look deep into who I am, it's part of being a person and it's part of what makes good people into great people, they see themselves, they're afraid, they lean into the fear and they decide to use it to motivate change.  Look, one thing they teach in psychology is to be hard on the problem and soft on the person because it's not the person that's the problem! The behaviour is the problem !  The fact that you want to change expresses something VERY fucking rare, not that you are self aware enough to see that your behaviour is destructive to others, most assholes see this, but that by hurting others you hurt yourself now that kind of insight makes you capable of being a fucking great person, in my opinion. Why? Because you realise that you are connected to everyone around you! Everyone around you is connected to you! Why is walking dead the comic so popular? Is it because it's about zombies? No. Is it because it's full of gripping moral lessons? No. It's because it's about people working together to survive against the worst fucking odds. In one episode a group of survivors actually melees an entire horde of zombies. Hundreds of zombies. Literally, shoulder to shoulder packed fucking horde. How do they do it? By working together! They trust each other! They are inspired by a great leader, and they selflessly decide to look out for HIM and thereby they one at a time come out, making each of the people before them EVEN MORE SAFE!  Okay. So. Holy shit this is the tangent to end all tangents. Next topic. Why are you a scumbag.  The thing about human behaviour, we act the way we do because at some point it helped us. So how does being mean and putting people under us help? Well as a kid I BET you felt inferior to somebody at some point. If they did it, you probably deserved to feel that way (in other words, you agreed when they judged you by saying 'You're so __ and I'm not so I'm better than you!' to clarify; you would have agreed but you wouldn't have admitted it. You would have sensed a tension in your belly and your heart, you would have reacted to this tension; 'NO I'M NOT DON'T SAY THAT' opposed to a more rational rejection 'lolwut? that aint me'). If you did it to yourself (inferiority complex), then well, you have some issues to work through, get a therapist or start meditation or tripple your points by doing both.  Now why is this relevant? Well some people make themselves into victims, their environment as a child helps them out when they cry, so they learn to cry well, they learn to cry often. Some people make themselves into helpers, their environment helps them out when they take responsibility for others (that's most counsellors, nurses, etc.) so they learn to help people out (guess which kind of kid I was [: ), some people learn to perform when they're kids, they're your jim carreys and robin williams', some people, like you, and most surgeons, and like maaany others in our broken bleeding hearted world learned to put people down because it served them somehow.   The point is this; accept it. It's simply what it is, there's no point denying and there's no point resisting. Simply observe it. If you get a hunger to eat something cause you're depressed, don't whip yourself and beat yourself in order to punish yourself for a habit that helped you feel good in the past, your ego is a simple animal of course it's going to want to do what it used to do, and what always worked for it. Instead of beating your inner child, simply feel the hunger. Sit still, feel it, watch it, feel how it moves your stomach, feel how it frustrates your throat. Observe your thoughts as they show you all the images and smells and sounds of your favourite foods floating around. Listen to your voice as it tries to rationalise 'this is stupid, this is pointless, that guy on reddit is a fucking asshole'. Just watch the entire process and I garuntee after you've done that you will be able to decide a tiny wee bit more consciously whether you want to go with your automatic pilot (reach for the snack / bully a mother fucker / rely on your passive aggressive 'joking' way etc.) or whether you want to go with a different option. An option which at the moment, since you've never actually DONE anything other than autopilot your way through, you don't even know exists.   But trust in your body, trust in your mind, trust in your intuition, the reason you've made the decisions to hurt yourself (eat too much / live on the couch instead of on the field) and others (say mean things) is because you have been denying the feelings your body has sent you. Why would you deny your intuition and your feelings? idk, tell me about your childhood and we might figure it out.   Okay so to wrap up; beat yourself up as much as you want but remember that we're all the same animal and you're not alone in this. Much as you may want to be special or whatever, we're all fucking damaged little emotional derpinoes and it's easier to fight your PROBLEM than it is to fight your IDENTITY so just try to focus on what it is you want to be and deal with all that existential shit when it's important (trust me it'll have it's time). The reason why humans are AWESOME is because they CONNECT to each other, anyone who doesn't connect is damaged and needs to protect themselves from other humans (because they have had FUCKING TERRIBLE humans in their lives, this is totally okay too, it's life) so if you want to be a good person and you're being genuine, and you're not just looking for sympathy because you're fucking SCARED and WEAK right now, then follow my advice; serve people. Find out what you have to give people, what you enjoy giving people, and what you can give people that they want, and hone in on that skill. Are you an artist? Make art that expresses your fucking damage, tell the story of a victim and allow someone else in the world to say 'holy fuck I'm not alone'. Tell the story of a villain and allow someone else in the world to say 'holy fuck I'm a scum bag' (LOL!). If you like to hurt people then start paying attention to how to HELP them too, because imagine this; imagine if every single time you hurt someone, you actually used their pain to heal them, by offering them the pathway out of their own suffering. Pretty crazy idea right? If you can do it AND make them laugh, bro, you're in the money right there. Lastly, in order to trust your gut, you have to sit still enough for long enough to observe what it's truly saying to you. Because every single time you feel threatened your ego will definitely yell loudly enough that it drowns out what your body wants from you, it's how almost all of us live in the western world, it's why we find eastern philosophy and spiritual mysticism so bullshit and laughable, because our heads are stuck that far up our own asses that our brain is full of shit and how is a brain gonna make observations and educated decisions when it's floating in shit?   Finally, I highly encourage you to reply and tell me how far on point and how ridiculously off track my post has been, whether it helped you or not etc.   TLDR Now, I don't want you to get a head any bigger than it already is (lul) so I wont praise you for your self awareness but I will say; you're on the right pathway. Keep it up, do the hard work, and you could not only turn your life around but you could also one day help other people turn their lives around! Good luck."

DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,Cheesyflakes,3,Sun May 31 21:46:00 2015 UTC,"Human beings are very judge mental to each other by nature, even though the truth is life isn't easy and what we should be doing is pulling together and encouraging each other. I am more often frustrated and annoyed by people than compassionate to them and I have also realized this lately.   I think one thing that helps is realizing our own personal inadequacies. That is not to say that we should obsess over them but realize, ' I'm feeling judge mental and superior against this person, but why? It's not like I don't have my own mistakes and issues."" I think too just the basic notion of how you would want people to see you. Having a sad/grumpy day? Bad hair day..skin day? Lost your job, had a breakup, found out you owe massive med bills, failed a class....this list could go on..whatever your problem that day you know that you would want people to see you with kindness and patience. We each have our mess ups and for some reason we judge each other harshly for them. I am not in any way criticizing you here because I know I'm totally guilty of the same, but consciously thinking of it this way and striving to be kind to people when you don't feel like it goes a long way. The change in attitude can take time, like any bad habit it can be hard to break. I grew up in an environment that was pretty lacking in compassion and full of judgement so I think that's where it's coming from for me. But realizing I'm an adult now and making lame excuses as a way to justify being that way is wrong. Perspective changes everything, and although we want instant results slow and steady perseverance is what wins in the end :)"

DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,r0bbitz,3,Thu Apr 16 03:16:40 2015 UTC,"I can't give you much help in the way you're asking but I do have an element of experience I'd like to share. All jokes directed at another person have some element of hurt attached to them. I used to tease a guy at my school for being fat and I'd regularly say 'I'm just joking!', but dressing up an insult as a joke doesn't change the core. I made a comment one day intending to poke fun and it really upset me, and he said that just because I say 'just kidding' it doesn't change anything. So poking fun at someone else, even if you get the tone and everything else right, still has this element of one-upping yourself and belittling the other person.  Sometimes the 'just kidding' element itself gets to burn the person another time too, for 'not getting the joke'.  It might help to be introspective about why you say those things. For me it was twofold. I was incredibly insecure at the time, and maybe 1/10 'jokes' were met with laughter and approval from those around me, which I really craved. So I was degrading people to put myself up, because I was insecure, and seeking approval, again because I was insecure.   I'm not saying that insecurity is your cause too, though it does tend to have this effect. Thinking and what and why, and not wanting to hurt people (the bit you've come to on your own already) is the best start to changing your behaviour. Good luck :) Feel free to PM me if you want to chat some more about it."
DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,anyideas,2,Thu Apr 16 05:37:53 2015 UTC,"I have been in your shoes. I used to be very sarcastic. Unfortunately, folks in life have really sensitive areas, and when they are joked about, they are already predisposed to feeling hurt about it. It's sort of like joke punching a friend in the arm, but then you find out they had a deep bruise there and you caused them actual pain.   Sarcasm is not a good trait. It's fine when you're out on a Friday and your assholish friend and you are making catty remarks about random folks. It's not fine when you're trying to build relationships and be caring.   First, apologize. Be sincere. I became master of apologies. There are steps.   You need to apologize, tell why it was a bad thing, acknowledge how it hurt the other person, tell how you will change your behavior in the future, and ask for their forgiveness. You may even want to ask how they would like you to interact with them in the future.  The worse the thing, the more I follow that formula. The less the thing, I cut part of that out. If I sound really formulaic or formal, I don't give a crap--I want them to know I'm serious.   At the same time, cut yourself a break. You can't MAKE anyone feel a way. You can't MAKE someone angry, you can't MAKE someone happy--that's on them. Their feelings are independent of your actions.   For example--giving flowers. You give flowers to someone and they might smile or be suspicious or be angry because of their own feelings about this. They feel the way they do because of how THEY think. Not because of the action itself. Give yourself a break this time.   Remember, long term, no one wants to hang out with the sarcastic guy. That guy never makes folks feel great about themselves."
DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,JohnnyRyde,2,Thu Apr 16 09:29:40 2015 UTC,"I've been really touched by this. My advice: lose the sarcasm. I did (or at least trying to do) the same not long ago - I decided that not hurting people is more important than being funny, so I deliberately eradicated all jokes, which are funny at the expense of someone else. I still struggle with jokes I make at the expense of myself - it comes so naturally to start taking the piss out of myself, it's hard to stop. Being funny is not important, let it go."
DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,valleycupcake,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:00:47 2015 UTC,"Realizing it is step one. I can identify with your position, and I have flipped the tables to find a level of stability and happiness in my life, having come from a place of immense anger, frustration, bitterness and depression.  When we are mean or make degrading jokes, it is a signal that we ourselves fear what we have projected towards the subject of the joke or comment. It is usually a big indication that you are feeling a consistent level of insignificance about yourself inside, and it's not like you have said or done something to purposely hurt or degrade someone, but you have said something that you believed would make others laugh, or see you as a comedian (something children learn at a very young age is an attention-getting routine). Attention is another word for significance in the human psyche.  You were looking for attention. It may have been because you were not given enough attention when you needed it most in your life. Whenever you do this, it is a reflection of trying to reconcile your standard feeling of rejection or loneliness or insignificance.  Think about if someone made a joke about your appearance to heighten their image in the eyes of a group of people. Wouldn't feel very nice, would it? Now also imagine that person has given you a great compliment - has really and truly accoladed your greatness in public. Makes you feel great, doesn't it?!  You might think more highly of that person who complimented you right? So that person who complimented you has gained accolades in return for giving accolades.  You see, you are trying to get what you want by giving other people what it is you've always gotten - a lack of significance or degrading humor. This way of communicating will consistently get you what you DON'T want.  Whatever you want in life - give it. Want love? Give love. Want compliments? Give compliments. Want friends? Give like the best friend in the world. Want compassion? Give compassion.  You will receive back in a massive measure the things you give. Every time you think one of your jokes will raise your status or make you appear to be funny - do a stop-check-redirect pattern in your mind. Stop - will this comment or joke really make me appear to others to be funny or is it only a cognitive distortion of mine? Check - what is it I am really after out of this situation? Is it really love? Can I get the same attention from people by giving love, where I was previously (unsuccessfully) seeking it using humor or degrading comments? Redirect - Seek to give people around you what it is you are looking for within yourself. Get really honest about what you're missing from your emotional well being, and GIVE what it is you are missing. It may be hard at first, but the first time you make someone genuinely smile - man, will you be hooked on love.  :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,smo0f,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:29:26 2015 UTC,"I think your example is a good example of the potential difference between what you INTENDED versus how your actions/words are INTERPRETED. Even if you meant something as a joke, you need to think about how your words might be interpreted by the other person. Even an awkwardly phrased but well-intentioned comment or question can be hurtful, so trying to be more mindful of that will give you a little more empathy and might prevent some foot-in-mouth moments.  If someone does call you on something, or if you feel like something you said/did wasn't received well, take a minute to think about what went wrong and how you can learn from it in the future. Like others said, it's really great that you've become conscious of this problem and are actually trying to make yourself better. We all have things to work on, and it's great that you've become aware of an issue and actually care enough to work on it! Always remember that it's a process; don't beat yourself up for well-intentioned mistakes, as long as you're constantly trying to learn from them."
DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,farmcodegary,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:15:58 2015 UTC,"The fact that you recognized this as bad behavior puts you way ahead of the game.  I know a lot of people who try this sort of insult, banter type of humor and have no idea that they're doing it wrong.  There's a guy I work with who is always making those kinds of comments.  I used to get insulted until I realized that he wasn't serious; he just has a really bad (or missing) sense of humor.  My advice is to just stop this kind of joking completely.  At least until you really know the person and know where his/her limits are.  You can't joke with every person in the same way."
DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,shminion,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:54:49 2015 UTC,"I think you can develop empathy by understanding others. You do this by asking questions non-judgmentally and listening for the answer. Also, studies have shown that the more time teens spend with electronics, the less they develop this trait. So keep that in mind if you are a teen--your brain is still developing until your early twenties, especially the frontal lobe which helps with emotions and impulse control. You want your brain to be as healthy as possible for the rest of your life, so treat it well."
DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,Fuquawi,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:50:10 2015 UTC,"Well, if you truly care about the friend(s) you just lost, start with apologizing to them and if you trust them, and want to remain friends with them, explain to them your predicament and ask them to help you out by calling you out on any future crap you say or do.   The key to being a truly nice person is empathy, being genuine, and being nice without expecting anything in return, without manipulating a situation, and not getting upset that being nice is not returned back to you in the same way that you give it out.  I'm sure you've gotten really good advice by some of the comments in this post, but being empathetic is not a switch that you can just turn on, but something that you will have to practice. In the beginning, give more thought to what you are about to say before you say it. There's things you can rag about with friends, and things you shouldn't. One thing you shouldn't rag about are personal traits/conditions the person can't change about themselves. Also, weight. Never make fun of someone for their weight, since a lot of people are very sensitive about it and have self image problems, whether you can tell or not. In general, especially for your situation, cut out ragging on anyone, regardless of how good of a relationship you have with them. And never say anything that might put someone down. If anything, say positive things. The level of which people like you or not is not determined just by what you say to them, but mainly by how you make them feel when they're around you. How they feel when they're around you is much more memorable (consciously and subconsciously) than anything else.  Other than that, it sounds like you're on the right path. Best of luck. And thanks for wishing me a good day!   edited for typos"

You are free to find yourself some other, and ma fellas are free to give more recommendations in comments.   Edit. Oh yeah. Optional. If you want to redeem yourself, bring her ego up. It is much harder to pull off, because it's actually a good deed, unlike apologise, which is around null. For example: Say her something along the lines of you made a great mistake, you secretly like/love her, and that's why you insulted her, because you are somewhat insecure. It will show her she is sexy to someone. Be ready for all the rumours. If this is a lie, so what? It's a lie that she is ugly, and you said it already. If it's not a lie, i am fucking god."
DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,Lu93,5,Thu Apr 16 14:14:34 2015 UTC,"IMVHO This is a shallow and manipulative approach, a sincere apology and show of regret goes much farther than a superficial boost to someone's ego. Fake ego boost leads to her having a shallow sense of self esteem built on the lie of another person, just imagine how you'd feel if someone who valued and respected you, was secretly a liar and only wanted to boost your ego because they ___. Very bad advice. A boost of ego is like a shot of an energy drink instead of motivation, yes it gets the job done, but if you do it the hard way then you get the true value of having learnt more about your character. In other words, you get ego STRENGTH instead of ego SECURITY. The security can be taken away, at any time, the strength, that shit's for life.  People who take short cuts in a race will make it to the end quickly, then they will get the first prize, but they will stand around with everyone else and deep down inside they will know that they lied to get there, that in fact, these other people won through hard work, and they got their because they were ruthless and selfish, they will feel this no matter how much they deny it, because they are social humans. This person is what a thug would call a 'fake ass motherfucker' and what a counsellor trained in humanistic or person centered would call 'incongruent'.   Anyone who doesn't feel the weight of their conscience when they make a decision to lie or cheat their way through life has high sociopathic tendencies and the last thing should be doing is involving other people in their perspective. Look at the movie Wolf of Wall Street for a perfect example of this, yes he has all the success and trappings of success, rich as fuck etc. But look at how he reacts to those fbi agents on his boat after he learns he cannot cheat them, in other words, after he sees what a man of INTEGRITY looks like.

I thought about downvoting you but I realised that your comment although I strongly disagree, your comment still added value to the discussion. I don't know what book you're talking about.  As for the unrealistic picture, you call that 'normal' and I call it 'insecure'. To me, there is no benefit in building a bridge with a shakey foundation, it is going to fall. Better to let the structure fall and then build something sturdy in its place. Something with a solid foundation. Ego driven compliments do not lead to a strong or sturdy foundation. They lead to a weak foundation which gives the impression of strength. In my opinion it is better to have no house, and the heavy responsibility and weight of freedom (you can build what you want) than to have a house that LOOKS and APPEARS to be strong, but in fact will cave in and crush me due to poor foundation. I don't know what you are suggesting is scary, lieing to people to make them feel better? Putting a band-aid compliment on a deep existential cancer? I don't know what you mean by this; scary for you, scary for me.   I think the world would be better if the world was honest to itself, when it looked in the mirror it said 'Are people resistant to me because I'm ugly? Maybe my ugliness is internal...' To me, THAT honesty is the much more frightening option, and to me that honesty is the much more appealing option, than to look in the mirror and say 'Well, he said I'm hot so... Maybe I only feel insecure for no reason?'   The truth will find you, no matter how hard or how far or how fast you run, it will find you. Better to turn around and invite it, than have it tear down the walls of your home.  [edit] also, there is no 'broscience' in my post, because it's just my opinion. Broscience is when you say 'Scientists proved that if you do blah blah then you get blah blah' and people blatantly lie about what they're talking about, pretending that it's factual and not just their own experience. I did not lie or state anything of fact, just how I see the world. If you disagree, then please tell me what is brosciency about my post and I will address / correct myself so that I am more clear about the things I say being my opinion.

DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,nomalaise,2,Thu Apr 16 22:51:46 2015 UTC,"Broscience is to create your own theories, which sound plausible but have no backup in experimental results (or anywhere, for that matter). For example, you compare psyche with constructions, and deduct that it should do nothing, because ""structure will fall"". You are obliged to yourself to keep your opinions as truthful as possible, so the fact ""it is just your opinion"" does you no good. Better be convinced before discussing with others how wrong they are. I would recommend you to go to lesswrong.com, it cleared my mind when it comes to these topics.   I say boost her lacking confidence, show her someone noticed her effort to become better, and she will probably try even harder. Have in mind that one asshole who fell in love with you does not make situation SO much better (I don't want to insult OP it's just how world looks from her perspective), but it is some progress nonetheless."

Who's state of the world is it that you're talking about? That of a high school aged girl who has issues about her weight? Or that of a high school aged girl who has issues with her self esteem? Or that of a high school aged girl who has issues about her value as a human? Because how you frame the topic in your own mind will effect how you use the word 'is'. I stated imvho because I was aware that when I said 'your theory IS blah blah' I was stating my opinion, not some sort of objective truth about reality in the world. No. My language is framed like this; here is my opinion, this is how I feeeeel about what I'm saying, this is what I think the world looks like and this is what I believe about the world due to how it looks to me. Based on these things, I use my broscience (you call it broscience, I call it intuition), this is the result I believe you will get from behaving like x y and z. I'm not trying to prove you wrong, I understand that your opinion is your opinion, I don't want to prove that mine is better than yours, or even challenge yours in any way. What I did want was to offer an alternative response to your opinion for anyone who might feeeel the same way that I do when I read your opinion (ie. manipulation is a shallow solution which causes more trouble than it's worth, strength of character goes much farther than any paper thin compliment). Notice the IS in my statement, this means I'm stating how I see the world, even though it sounds like (and feels like) I'm making a blanket statement about the world.  'You are obliged to keep your opinions as truthful as possible' I don't understand, who is obliging me? You? You already admitted that you lie for personal gain, so..? Are you saying that I am obliged to myself to keep my opinion as truthful as possible? But how do I assign truth value on my opinion? Do I want to do a masters in logic and syntax in order to understand the 'Inherent Truth Value' of the statement; 'liars cannot be trusted?' This is my opinion, so how am I going to 'keep this opinion as truthful as possible'?

DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,Lu93,1 point,Fri Apr 17 08:27:31 2015 UTC,"Now, that is a long post.   Again, you call it progress but when you use the word 'is' it sounds like you're talking about the state of the world. Who's state of the world is it that you're talking about? That of a high school aged girl who has issues about her weight? Or that of a high school aged girl who has issues with her self esteem? Or that of a high school aged girl who has issues about her value as a human? Because how you frame the topic in your own mind will effect how you use the word 'is'.    Uhm, how many girls are there, lol... Idk now. The one that OP said is ugly person. She had problems with her picture of herself. Saying i love you can be seen as progress in her eyes.    I stated imvho because I was aware that when I said 'your theory IS blah blah' I was stating my opinion, not some sort of objective truth about reality in the world. No. My language is framed like this; here is my opinion, this is how I feeeeel about what I'm saying, this is what I think the world looks like and this is what I believe about the world due to how it looks to me. Based on these things, I use my broscience (you call it broscience, I call it intuition), this is the result I believe you will get from behaving like x y and z.    If you are not ready to stand behind your words, this whole discussion is pointless. How do you give advice if it is based on something you don't even believe in (i say ""you believe"" when you can take responsibility, and stand behind your words.    I'm not trying to prove you wrong, I understand that your opinion is your opinion, I don't want to prove that mine is better than yours, or even challenge yours in any way.    Well, you said straight ""no"". And gave arguments, so you challenged my opinion. I mean... Opinion can be right or wrong. Opinion is not polar bear, safe from any criticism.    What I did want was to offer an alternative response to your opinion for anyone who might feeeel the same way that I do when I read your opinion (ie. manipulation is a shallow solution which causes more trouble than it's worth, strength of character goes much farther than any paper thin compliment). Notice the IS in my statement, this means I'm stating how I see the world, even though it sounds like (and feels like) I'm making a blanket statement about the world.   A is B. This is statement. It is false. If you believe in it, stop. Change your beliefs.    'You are obliged to keep your opinions as truthful as possible' I don't understand, who is obliging me? You?    I am obliged to myself, you are to yourself.    You already admitted that you lie for personal gain, so..?   This lying is for others personal gain. But that is not what makes it right to do. If the world (from global look) is better, objectively, after some deed, be it lie or hard work, you should go for it.    Are you saying that I am obliged to myself to keep my opinion as truthful as possible? But how do I assign truth value on my opinion? Do I want to do a masters in logic and syntax in order to understand the 'Inherent Truth Value' of the statement; 'liars cannot be trusted?'    You can do as much as read few articles, or some book. For example, lesswrong.com, or you can find books about rationality. You don't need full master studies, though if you feel passionate, go for it.    This is my opinion, so how am I going to 'keep this opinion as truthful as possible'?    Prescriptive statements can't be true or false. Descriptive statements can.    Do I set out a scientific method to test for 'trustworthiness' and then go and find liars and incentivise them or otherwise trick them somehow into doing my test? And then what? Do I need my paper reviewed and approved in peer level scientific journals? And what for? So that I can say 'Yes, now I can have faith in my opinion because it has a Truthfulness rating of 10 / 10 and will continue to do so until someone finds a better Theory of Trustworthiness' or is it more likely that I will accept that every person in the world has their own truth, and that my truths, though I can value them as higher or lower than that of others, cannot be really judged in terms of comparison unless they are judged fairly, that is, against my other truths.    This is fucked up. I think there is one universe where we all live in and every statement that describes this universe can be right or wrong.   In other words, what the hell are you talking about 'truthfullness of my opinion' I don't think I understand you, please help me out because although my attitude might come across as quite negative / condescending to be honest I'm really enjoying this exchange with you because most people I disagree with give up far before this point and your challenges have really helped me clarify my thoughts. (thanks)   Well, long post almost averted me as well. Go for books about rationality, man. This site i gave you, it's totally worth it. I see you are curious, that will help you a lot.    I don't expect you to agree with me, by the way. I don't expect you to value either your opinion or my opinion over the other, because to me, the markets of opinions are separated by the people who hold them. In other words, the value of my opinion can't be judged by it's worth in a foreign market, unless of course the owner of that market decides to look into the opinion and decide for themselves if it interests them.

DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,MyMonochromeLife,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:35:35 2015 UTC,"Okay I guess I see where we differ. Your education has shown you that logic if you learn it deeply enough will always lead you to the same place. No matter who you are or what background you have, an education in logic will take you down the same roads to the same destination (conclusion). This I don't agree with. I think that the psychological make up of a person, the events they've had, the memories they draw from, the experiences that have shaped how they see the world, is going to colour the way they see things, so that if I'm for example, a lawyer defending a case in court, my defense will be different than if you are a lawyer defending a case in court. Even though we might both be brilliant lawyers.  I feel like this conversation is pointless, because you haven't really addressed any of the points that I feel are important. I mean, you say 'she is better off if she feels better' and you assume that lieing will do that. And I say 'but what about the morality and from a position of ego strength?' and you ignore this and say 'broscience makes your point invalid' yet obviously my point isn't valid if only two people commented on your posts and both of them (me and the other guy) have only one problem with it; manipulative and shallow.   The thing is, to me a purely rational logical statement doesn't hold weight. I'm not swayed by rational / logical statements. I'm swayed by how I feel about things. If you look at MBTI scores, you can see that there's 'thinker / feeler' section, which describes how the person makes decisions about the world. The way that I see it, if my intuition tells me that something is dangerous or offputting, I'm going to trust waaaay more than what my mind is telling me (but it's logical, 'you'll fit in' 'you'll make her happy') whatever. I feel like talking to you is wasting my time at this point because you continuously ignore the point that I'm trying to make. Like, with your answer 'how many girls are there' did you misunderstand what I was saying, or are you being deliberately avoidant of the point that I was making? Obviously there is only one girl. But the point I was making was that the way that YOU see her, the way that YOU internally see the world, that has an enormous impact on the statement you will choose to make. For example 'she will be better off if I lie to her' is a statement you would find as logical. But coming from someone else, who has had a very different EXPERIENCE of life, might say something like 'if I am honest with her she will get more options of how to behave / what to do with her life'.   Of course I stand behind my words, again, you're saying things as though they're statements about the world that everyone understands. But I literally have no idea what you mean 'stand behind your words'. I told you, if you want to critique my words, that's on YOU, just like me critiquing your words, is ON ME. Right?   Look, morality doesn't fit very easily into a logical framework, why, because morality is subjective. What is 'RIGHT' for you is actually 'WRONG' for me. Get it?   No deed is separate from the world. Everything that happens has a lasting impact. If you lie to her, it will influence what she does that day and how she feels. How she feels will influence what she says to herself when she gets home. What she says will influence what she thinks when she wakes up, the influence of one act will continue for ever. If you deceive someone to make them feel good, then their feeling is built on a deception, it means that their feeling of goodness is just as shallow as if someone feels good because they are rich. The money can be taken away, what then? They will have to face what was beneath the money, they will have to face the emptiness inside their heart. The reason I give you such long responses is because I get the feeling that you don't understand me. So I think maybe if I give lots of examples, then you'll get what I'm trying to say. (notice emphasis on trying, I put emphasis because I understand that you can misinterpret what I'm saying, why can you misinterpret what I'm saying, when someone else doesn't? Is it because I'm not being clear enough? Not giving enough examples? I think it's because You and ME have DIFFERENT psychological makeup, just like physicists saying 'it's a wave' and other physicists saying 'no it's a string').  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)  ^ All these physicists think they were commenting on the world, but they were commenting on themselves. This statement; the slide shows a string, becomes this statement; I see a string in the slide.   BIG DIFFERENCE."
DecidingToBeBetter,32rdkx,Lu93,2,Sat Apr 18 08:56:19 2015 UTC,"Observer effect (physics):       In science, the term observer effect refers to changes that the act of observation will make on a phenomenon being observed. This is often the result of instruments that, by necessity, alter the state of what they measure in some manner. A commonplace example is checking the pressure in an automobile tire; this is difficult to do without letting out some of the air, thus changing the pressure. This effect can be observed in many domains of physics.  The observer effect on a physical process can often be reduced to insignificance by using better instruments or observation techniques.  Historically, the observer effect has been confused with the uncertainty principle.

Also, if you visit my profile, I had a post very similar to this and I can happily say I am not the happiest I've ever been right after a menacing depression.   Once you get a regular routine like HindranceWasTaken suggested, try doing very simple stuff like finding some clubs or activities to do on your days off. You will naturally find friends that way, since you said your downfall started with a break up, I would suggest hitting a bar on a regular basis (keep drinking to a minimum and know your limits) and start chatting some people up.

An example of something that I would find productive but not others, would be video games. I have always been a competitive gamer so I always put in some time to be better at what ever game I'm playing. Whether it be trying to push to master league in Starcraft or getting 2200 rating in WoW arena, I try just to get better.   I workout about an hour a day 4-5 days a week and play guitar about the same amount of time. I study hard for my tests (last year of college) although the amount of time I put in depends on what kind of test. Right now I am studying for my Mutual Funds and Securities IFC exam and I have put about 3-4 hours per day the last couple of weeks. It's hard to stay focused studying consecutively so I take breaks, like this reddit break I'm taking right now :)  You can definitely improve your stamina over time, I believe so anyway. I noticed that when I started being healthier in general I was able to do more of the things that I wanted/needed to do in a day. Things like drinking alcohol less and quitting coffee were huge factors in that department. Exercise obviously gives you more energy as well. I was a late bloomer and just started getting my shit together at age 27 (young I know, but I used to be a mess) so I don't mind missing unnecessary reasons to put bad things into my body.

An effective dosage leaves me groggy and lightheaded in the morning; also in a pretty bad mood. But if I take lower dosages it does nothing overall. I've stopped taking Melatonin and just stopped looking at the computer 30 + minutes before bed."
DecidingToBeBetter,32plbq,Kvaw,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:20:53 2015 UTC,why does it say do not take for more than 3 weeks in a row on the bottle?  also what is a good dose?
DecidingToBeBetter,32plbq,Vicious_Tardigrade,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:56:00 2015 UTC,The effects of melatonin increases as you continue to take an amount each night. And it's different per person. I say use a pill cutter and start with half a 3mg and if you feel it's insufficient. Move up to a whole one. Don't take more than one pill per night
DecidingToBeBetter,32plbq,bscoop,8,Thu Apr 16 19:24:37 2015 UTC,"First: Sleep comes in waves. They're usually abut 45m-90m apart. If you miss one, you're gonna have trouble sleeping till the next.  Second: Lying in bed, not sleeping, so long as you're managing to relax yourself and not stress, Is almost as good as sleep. If you find yourself lying in bed unhappy lying there (depressed or overly stressed) you're probably better off finding something productive or fun to do (work out, catch up on school/work or read.  Do this until you feel sleepy then IMMEDIATELY go to bed; do not miss the wave.  Finally: Someone already mentioned it, but meds won't make you feel great. Just use them to reset your clock if you need to do it quickly or if you're at around 3-4 days with no sleep.  Don't forget, restfully lying in bed not asleep isn't so bad."
DecidingToBeBetter,32plbq,izwizard,3,Wed Apr 15 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"Addition to the second point: Lying in bed relaxed and not stressed while browsing the internet/using a computer doesn't count. Be sure that you aren't using electronic devices (phone, tablet, TV, laptop - anything with a screen) in the hours before or in bed. The light temperature from these devices mimic daylight to your body and keep you awake. If you absolutely must, be sure to use something like F.lux or Twilight to adjust color temperature."

DecidingToBeBetter,32plbq,kumarisin103,2,Wed Apr 15 20:51:40 2015 UTC,"I started taking it about six months ago when I really needed to sleep, and after using it a while my body synced up with the sleep schedule and I haven't needed it lately.

DecidingToBeBetter,32plbq,Marcools,3,Wed Apr 15 22:21:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's a hormone. No, it's not physically addictive. It's not dangerous. It's not like testosterone where it can fuck up your body, it just makes you sleepy. If you take too much you'll still be sleepy the next day, so that kind of defeats the purpose, but that's all. It's over-the-counter for a reason."

My brain and body just never seemed to be good at shutting down, and I always envied my friends and partners who could seemingly fall asleep at the drop of a hat.   The best solution, the one that actually has me yawning and so bleary eyed that I can't stay awake, is forcing myself to work out every morning at 5:30am. I have never been a morning person, but switching my routine to 4:30am wake ups has been the best thing I've done. I get my workout taken care of right off the bat, I feel awesome and energized for the rest of the day, and by 8pm I'm so tired that if I don't go to sleep soon, I will pass out wherever I happen to be. And I actually stay asleep, which is amazing!  It really sucks for the first little while, because I essentially had to force myself up at 430 the first morning, but I was so tired by the end of the day that I slept like the dead. And it gets easier every day."

DecidingToBeBetter,32plbq,TankSpank,2,Thu Apr 16 01:21:27 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it fully does. Do I miss staying up all night playing video games? Sure. Do I miss texts from my friends when they are doing something awesome because I'm asleep? Absolutely. Do I have trouble staying up late when I DO go out? Of course! But I'm trying to do a thing for myself, and to do that I have to put myself first. I've definitely had to make some sacrifices.   So I don't go out a lot during the week. Those things will always be there. There will always be another party. And I do still regularly hang out with friends and do fun stuff -- but I try to stick to weekends, with only the occasional weeknight. Or I just have to leave early. I have a routine, I am getting into the best shape of my life, I can sleep and I feel awesome about myself and what I've accomplished so far, so it's hard to just ignore the results because I think I want to go out and have fun and party every night, you know?  I'm not saying it's for everyone; working out no matter what time of day will probably help you sleep better. But for me, becoming an early riser has changed my life in such a positive way, I don't think I can go back!"

DecidingToBeBetter,32plbq,bicyclegeek,2,Thu Apr 16 00:02:16 2015 UTC,Morning exercise.  Once you try it you will love it.  Since it is in the morning you get all the physical energy out of your body which allows you to hit flow state(the mental zone) much earlier in the day.  You can burn the midnight oil at midday.  And by the time night rolls around you are extra tired from the exercise and your day.  If you exercise later in the day you don’t get the early flow state advantage and it can energize you and keep you awake.

When I was younger I would hope and hope that they would answer, as they had been a good friend, and it would drive me crazy.   Yes, a direct approach hurts, but at least it's a one time hurt, and not a long, drawn out hurt.   ""Hey So-And-So, I know I haven't been in touch. Our past was difficult for me, and I realize that overall our friendship had a negative effect on me. I'm moving forward, and I hope you will too. I wish you the best, but I would honestly prefer no contact from this time forward.""  If it is someone you may run into, you can tack on ""what do they do if they see me in person?""

DecidingToBeBetter,32ngyh,WildContinuity,3,Wed Apr 15 06:28:00 2015 UTC,"Ive been the person youre talking about before. A girl I knew as a teen, and I ruined our relationship say 5 years ago when we went out, and I was just bad for her. I wasnt nasty or amything to her, I was just a dickhead teenager. And with other circumstances in her life, I was just bad for her. I used her and ignored a lot of her needs. Not proud of it at all and I'd take it all back if I could.  I did the same: every few months or so Id make contact with her. At the start, she was doing it to me, too. Then she realised how she needed the toxic people in her life gone, and rightly so she went about burning bridges with them, which included me because therw was history and mixed up feelings still there between us. And she was smart enough to see that it had to stop for ever.  And the way she did it was just ignoring my contact. And, after a few times of getting only silence from her, I got the hint. And as I got older, I realised more and more why, and how neccessary it was.  These days, we have occassional contact. She said one time that she underatands that we were both young and stupid. She was so good about it. And we kinda found a truce. And these days, I let her make contact with me. I dont want her to remember me unless she wants to.  So anyway, point is, just ignore their contact. It really is the best way. If they absolutely will not take the hint, then you have to explain exactly why you dont want their contact, because as I said, it took my stupid arse a matter of years to grow up enough and realise just how warranted her burning of our bridge was."

There was a girl I knew for a few years and we were somewhat close.   One day I was evaluating my life and those around me, and I separated from those who were not a positive influence on me and she turned out to be one of those people.   She moved across the country so it became easier to not contact her. I took the ignore approach, but she was pretty persistent. I actually marked her text messages as spam. One day I checked my spam messages and there were a ton from her. She basically told me I was a horrible person and what have you.   I knew what I did was a bit childish, so I sent her a text back, aplogized for ignoring her, and let her know what was up. She pretty much cursed me out, and told me to go fuck myself. It solidified my decision and made me regret being honest with her. However, in retrospect, I am glad that I ended up being honest with her. I'm also happy to say that she has not came in contact with me since I gave her closure.   In the end, the choice is up to you on wether or not you want to ignore them or just be straight up with them. If you want them off your back, tell the truth. If you don't mind deleting their texts, then ignore them."
DecidingToBeBetter,32ngyh,cmputrnx,14,Wed Apr 15 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"The simplest answer is just to block them on your mobile device. If you have a smartphone, this really couldn't be simpler. Just select their number and hit Add to Reject List.  The second-easiest solution is to change your phone number (and obviously don't tell them about it). If you're concerned that your friends might share your new information with this person then be sure to speak to them and let them know why you're doing this. Good friends will understand and respect your wishes.  I would avoid directly confronting the person you are trying to avoid and consider it a last resort. It will only result in hurt for both parties, they at being rejected by you and possibly you as well from repercussions of their hurt feelings.

DecidingToBeBetter,32ngyh,MyMonochromeLife,0,Wed Apr 15 15:48:11 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, and it's an unfortunate reality of this type of situation. If someone is truly having a negative affect on your life and you need to get rid of them, then you need to harden your heart to them and move on. It's self-preservation, pure and simple.  Please don't think that I'm being aloof and that I don't understand the difficulty of OP's situation. I had to do exactly this to someone that I cared deeply about many years ago, and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done. In short, they were in a bad place and I wanted so badly to rescue them from it, even though there was nothing I could do. The end result (and I did this multiple times before wising up) was that I would end up hurt and depressed and no one would be in a better place than they were before, only a worse one.  So, while having thoughts about the emotional well-being of the person you are attempting to cut off contact with is compassionate, if you truly intend to remove them from your life you need to harden your heart and take the necessary steps regardless of the consequences to anyone but yourself. It's an extremely hard thing to do, and it is not a decision to be taken lightly."

It worked for me. ymmv  If you don't want to be rude, write them a letter, say everything you think you want to. 'I don't want you in my life any more, I've taken your influence as something I want to remove and I wont be responding to your contact any more. I anticipated a reaction (outbursts, controlling, manipulative, guilt tripping, outrage, suicide threats, murder threats, fucking sneaking in and melting my icecream while I sleep threats, whatever) thus I chose to write a letter because although you'll no doubt take this badly, it's better than being a coward and not saying anything to you, this way there's no confusion. Please sort your shit out and leave me alone, thank you for reading and have a nice life'"

You dad sounds tired from working all day, and your mom sounds like she doesn't believe you can make it on your own.   So when your dad comes home after a hard day in the coal mines, what does he come home to and what have you been doing all day?  Are you contributing to the stress everyone is feeling?  When he comes home does he find out you were productive, kept the house clean, cooked dinner, did laundry, kept your room clean, looked for job, etc.?  If not you deserve to get yelled at, you are 21 years old, start acting like it.    Contribute around the house, use this time to learn how to keep your place clean, how to cook (you will need to cook for yourself, eating out all the time is very expensive, cooking for yourself is cheap and girls love guys that can cook a nice dinner), do laundry, etc.  All the ""grown up"" stuff."

When I was nineteen I used to look around at all the outgoing, happy people and say to myself 'what am I doing wrong? Why can't I have that?'  I'm twenty-seven now and I'm just starting to get myself figured out. Other people don't make me happy, only I can make me happy. Find the things that really make you feel good about yourself and do them, for YOU and only you. For me it was martial arts, working out, and even simple stuff like styling my hair and wearing nicer clothes. I always told myself those things were preppy and stupid (why would I care what I look like to other people?) But I tried it, and it makes me feel good and confident.  You're 19. In ten years, I promise, you will be a completely different person. You have a lot of time to figure it out, and the fact that you're thinking about it means that you are on the right track.

Being a few years older than you I can see in retrospect how everyone around our age is fighting just to hold it together tbh.  I don't really have any advice for you other than try not to compare yourself to others, comparisons really help no one. Work on your issues by breaking them up in to small chunks and make small easily achievable goals. And try to lose the 'my whole life sucks' attitude because having that attitude just sends you on a downwards spiral of fail (I know this s easier said than done, and we have all been there!)."
DecidingToBeBetter,32kk4s,andrew_omg,8,Tue Apr 14 17:18:46 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel like you're projecting here. My first thought was, ""That's not true at all.""  Maybe I was just surrounded by extremely confident people but it seemed to me that late teens, early 20s is about when most people feel comfortable in their skin. Then life starts to make them doubt themselves. But, that's just anecdotal.  At 19, I was athletic, popular, confident and smart. I don't know what happened but extreme anxiety due to weight gain robbed me of that confidence in my late 20s. Took a lot of work to find myself again.  I only mention all this because saying, ""19 year olds are awkward and unsure of themselves,"" isn't helpful or maybe even true.  A well-adjusted person shouldn't feel like that. And, if they do, the answer is not simply not to compare oneself to others. It's to be better. Anyway, just some thoughts. Cheers!"
DecidingToBeBetter,32kk4s,andrew_omg,2,Tue Apr 14 18:30:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks that's an interesting perspective. As you might imagine I disagree! I can only speak from my experience, but I would hazard a guess that despite your perfect young adulthood, that perception of self is far from the norm. I'm not denying your experience, but I'd argue that your confidence might have blinded you to reality. I'm a person who relies on my friends for support, and it continually amazes me how much people open up when you show some vulnerability - everyone in my circle has had issues of some kind and it is normal.  I'm not saying it's healthy or ideal, but it is normal. This is only a theory, but maybe someone like yourself who had no vulnerabilities missed these kinds of conversations and therefore took the confidence of others at face value. Believe me, I've seen some amazing feats of saving face. Again, I'm not trying to argue or say you didn't experience what you did, just theorising.  I agree though, of course OP should try and be better. But that's not going to happen if he/she believes everyone else is cruising through life effortlessly and he/she is just a lost cause, because that couldn't be further from the truth. Comparisons are stupid because everyone is doing their best to make it look like they're doing great.. indeed many are doing great in every respect, but most are not."

I am, just now, at 30, able to put myself through school because, well, the universe shits people out and then says, ""Good luck, sucker!"" I'm certainly not experiencing the world through rose-colored glasses. I just find it hard to believe, given all my experiences and conversations with others that most people are more lost than not.

I'd never bartended before and dreaded the thought but knew I had to do it. I put on a happy face and bullshitted my way through the interview, landed the job on the spot and started the following day. Over the course of a couple of years, I learned new skills, made new friends and grew my customer base substantially. The girl who would go home and cry her eyes out for five hours out of pure emotional exhaustion after each shift had become the one who could sling drinks and entertain folks without a second thought. My eye contact improved, my self confidence improved and when I opted to leave bartending and go back to school, I found myself a much more fulfilled and confident person. I rarely second guess myself now.  Next up, take dancing lessons to improve my physical sureness.

Something that makes you think ""In what way can I improve myself?""  /u/andrew_omg brings up a very valid point, that you absolutely cannot compare yourself to others.

What I would like you to realize is that in this day and age, you are really very, very safe. There are few REAL threats or dangers on a daily basis (unless you are in the Middle East, and if that is the case I apologise). Ultimately, getting out of your rut will require you to wake up some day, say ""fuck it"" and walk out the door to do something different. I'd love to say there is a miracle cure, there simply isn't.

I don't know you and if I saw you on the street I would assume you have a normal life. Most people have no idea what your problems are or even care.   So work on you. You really are in a really good position if you recognize it. You're 19. I wish I was 19. Write a list of things you want to do with your life and then go about figuring out how to accomplish those things. Figure out what the hell makes you happy? Piece by piece day by day.  You don't need to work on everything  all at once and I would advise against it. But work on it piece by piece. It also doesn't mean that you will see large improvements in one day. Baby steps. Piece by piece. If you fall off your wagon and go back to watching TV then just recognize you've fallen and get right back on the wagon.   You mentioned something about being more sociable. Ok. This will take work. You will have to put in effort to change this. One of the things that I would recommend is joining some meetups. www.meetup.com. Then once you get into some groups talk to people about anything. Then when you go to stores. Talk to the people who work there. If you frequent stores definitely talk to those people. Get to know their first names and about their lives. Shake their hands. I've found that by doing this you also will get better service when you go to those stores because YOU care about the people who work there and therefore they will care more about you.

Further, if you have everything figured out at 19, then you must not have big plans or aspirations. I'd personally say that it is a great sign you are so unsure of yourself.

I took the circuitous route to happiness, but I'm happier than I have ever been. But overall, it's about knowing the real you. Someone, somewhere, made you feel you weren't enough. But inside of you is someone incredible and powerful. It's about nurturing this being. If you're different, embrace it. I know that's extremely hard as a 19 year old. But that's the key. Many successful people in life will tell you they felt different, they felt down. But recognizing that the thing that makes you different is what draws other people to you and shapes your purpose - that's powerful. That said, it sounds like you are down, so I would recommend talking to someone like a professional. They can hook you up with some powerful practices like CBT, Mindfulness, and others, but also listen to you compassionately - that helps."

DecidingToBeBetter,32kk4s,Bdi89,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:50:59 2015 UTC,"It seems one of your biggest underlying issues is a lack of confidence, which isn't an easy trait to build. My advice would be to focus on bettering yourself physically, mentally, and spiritually (if you're into that sort of thing).   Exercising, eating healthy, and getting adequate sleep will do wonders for not only your physical health, but will also improve your general disposition. You'll be stronger and will gain the satisfaction of investing time and energy into your well-being. I started at home and eventually moved to the gym, you can do it too.   Don't feed your body garbage. It's the vessel that carries you through your brief existence, treat it well.  I was, and still am to some degree, a very self-conscious person. If you're the same and appearance is a source of your fear then do something about it instead of wishing for change. You're confidence will explode if you're willing to put work and sweat into a better you.  You're the only one in your head and the only one who will ever be in there for the rest of your life so stop being such a fucking dick to yourself. The self pity/loathing needs to stop if there's going to be any progress. Keep comparing yourself to others if you have to, but strive to be the person that you want to be not who everyone else wants to. Also realize that you cannot lie to yourself, only rationalize your actions. If you choose the weak, timid, stupid option it's because you convinced yourself it's okay for you to do it.   I was lucky and found a great field of study that I'm passionate about during my first year of university. You don't need to find what you want to do for the rest of your life, but try and find something you can be passionate about. Something you can talk about with emotion and confidence. This can be anything, but obviously will be most beneficial if it has the potential to make friends or to make you stronger, smarter, or richer. Some of my hobbies include weight lifting, running, rock climbing, and video games.   If you spend more than an hour a day looking at porn, then you need to face the reality that is addiction. I'm not going to go on some rant about how porn is evil, but I will say that I feel better having cut (most of) it out of my life. I have more time in the day and I think the act of restricting myself from something I used to spend so much time doing has been a huge boon to my mental stability. If I can control my cravings then maybe I can go to the gym, or not spend the next 4 hours on reddit, or do my homework early, etc.  To summarize everything: If you invest time and effort into yourself, you will be happier with yourself and will become a more confident person. And remember this is all a process and expecting instant results is the easiest way to halt and reverse progress.   I think when you find yourself you'll realize that happiness isn't being the social maverick, smiling all the time, or surrounding yourself with outgoing friends, it's being able to accept yourself and working towards your potential. Please don't give up.   That's all I've got for now."
DecidingToBeBetter,32kk4s,yes_darling,1 point,Wed Apr 15 07:23:48 2015 UTC,"I had a spell of this when I was 19. It was my freshman year of college and I got homesick. I would barely go to class and any other time was spent on the computer or with a small group of guys I met. I slept almost 10 hours of sleep a night, and when I woke up I felt like complete shit. There was a point sometime in my second semester that I decided that I didn't want to do this anymore, I needed change. It was at that point that I made a pledge that I was going to start making myself follow a list rules that I made. I started waking up early, ate healthy meals, started exercising, read a book for pleasure for an hour a day, went to every single class and spent less time watching tv, there were definitely results. I felt started feeling happy when I woke up, more confident. The confidence helped me meet new people, who I now consider good friends.   Now mind you this wasn't over night, it took me a while to start feeling better with myself. I would sometimes regress, but at those moments you have to remind yourself what you want in life. Personally, what I want is to be able to enjoy it the most I can while I'm here. To be able to do that I need a good education, and good friends. That is still what drives me today. Although I do give myself ""cheat days."" These were days were I straight up vegged. I laid in bed till noon watching netflix and smokin. I could do anything I wanted (these days occur sparingly when I have no responsibilities). But the next morning it's right back to reality.   If you don't think this will work for you, or you think I'm full of shit I'm alright with that. But there is one thing I want you to do, just take a look at your life. Look at your past, present and where you want to be to 10 years into the future. That's it. I know that if you're really feeling how you are you'll want to change. Best of luck, you can do it."
DecidingToBeBetter,32lg7z,The-Redwing,4,Tue Apr 14 19:04:55 2015 UTC,"I get easily stuck in a very similar kind of place! At the very least, you're not alone in the world :)  I would say this, though: the fact that you feel some amount of conflict as you have gone between these phases is a positive sign. It shows a level of self-awareness that's going to be key in finding more balanced rhythms in the long term!  I think that questions about motivation can often be tackled with asking yourself why you do anything. When we struggle with self-worth, sometimes our actions are the ways we try and compensate - and so our motivation comes entirely from the struggle to be valued. When we start making progress and feeling our own sense of value more, suddenly our main source of motivation has disappeared along with our inadequacy! The easy trap to fall into is then feeling inadequate, locking yourself into old patterns.   So, here's an idea: avoid letting this become another battle for self-worth, and seize opportunities to find awesome motivations to do things. Put improving yourself to the side for a little while, and instead ask yourself why you want to do anything. Think about your own desires, your values, the people you care about. Connect with your passions. If you find yourself without passions to hand: don't despair.  Sometimes it takes a little time and searching. It's cool.   Any help? :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,32lg7z,beardyjim,3,Tue Apr 14 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"I read an analogy right here several months ago.    Let's say you have a favorite BBQ place that you frequently go to.   The food is great, nice atmosphere, it just has everything you want.    Then one day a friend invites you out to a different BBQ place, and oh man, it is just plain better.    The fact that the new place is better doesn't make the old one retroactively bad, you follow?       It is the same thing with self improvement.     I'm good, but I could be better.   I'll work on being better, and if something doesn't pan out then oh well I'm still good."
DecidingToBeBetter,32lg7z,abiteveryday,2,Wed Apr 15 22:53:09 2015 UTC,"I guess the way I got over this is by being okay with the fact that I am a work in progress. Don't feel bad about wanting to relax, don't feel bad about wanting to improve - all of these feelings are natural human instinct, just embrace them and embrace how they affect how you feel.   As far as avoiding 'wasting' time (for extended periods) - that'll take some kicking of your own ass. Find something you like - I recently stumbled across an interactive site that teaches Java. When I notice myself spending time on reddit, I'll put a 10 minute timer on, and keep goofing off until the timer goes off, then get back to work. This allows you to postpone the return to work just enough that you still get the mental satisfaction of blowing off some steam. Meditate, and identify why your insecurities exist. How do negative thoughts about yourself come to fruition? What has happened in your life to invoke these thoughts? Once you can identify those things, and take a scientific method at tackling those things, they will no longer bother you.  All of that was a little jumbled, but I hope it helps!"
DecidingToBeBetter,32lg7z,youlovethisish,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:12:30 2015 UTC,"I'd say give it a few months and see if you balance out naturally.  Just relaxing gets boring.  You need the instincts to improve for yourself instead of for others to kick in.  It's a completely different kind of motivation that you haven't used yet.  That fact that some part of you is questioning your new killing time approach to life, and that you're still doing your schoolwork, is enough for me to say just give it some time."
DecidingToBeBetter,32lg7z,chattymcgee,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:09:30 2015 UTC,"It's one thing to think you aren't good enough and another to think you are a work in progress. After a stressful time, it is completely natural to just relax. That's what happened to me after I quit law school. That said, you should use this time to find out more about what you really love, and enjoy yourself and don't feel guilty (guilt is a counterproductive emotion in the long run)! By starting to determine what really means something to you, you can naturally be drawn to work hard to improve in that area."

But I can be BETTER!  I WILL BE BETTER!   The reason I look at it this way is because while, yes, I am doing okay: doing okay in school, am in half-decent shape, have a stable living arrangement, I do feel that I can always improve and that I want to be in a much better place than I am right now."

DecidingToBeBetter,32lg7z,chris2point0,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:16:20 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, I know what this feels like.  I suffer from autism spectrum disorder, PTSD, and have had clinical depression for most of my life.  After I attempted suicide back in winter of '08, my failure steeled me into pursuing self-improvement within my own life, but for all the wrong reasons.   We tend to feel like we are moving slow in life, but then look back and realize how far we have come. I've been learning to embrace mindfulness in this area, and it's difficult because I am impatient. We are all impatient. When we want change, we want it now! I am tired of working with physical, mental, and social dysfunctions.  I too go from being strong on self-improvement to having days of doing little. In reality, you are being too hard on yourself. What matters is not how slow you are improving, but that you are improving. Learning patience with yourself is a hard thing to learn, and you have to just cut yourself a break. Figure out how much you can handle, and just push yourself little by little. Take a personal inventory and see what you can do now that you couldn't before. If it's emotional, see what you can deal with now that you couldn't before. Growth has no context if you can't see where you started from. You want to find balance? That's the key.  I have had to learn social skills. I have to struggle to overcome fear and paranoia. I have had to turn a frail body into something to be proud of. You are the author of your story. You are the painter and life is your canvas.  Make a masterpiece, but don't worry if you do it slowly.  ""You don't set out to build a wall. You don't say 'I'm going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that's ever been built.' You don't start there. You say, 'I'm going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid.

DecidingToBeBetter,32m27a,haimaro,5,Tue Apr 14 21:44:26 2015 UTC,"It sounds like part of it is that you don't have a support system. While its embedded in American culture that you should just pull yourself up by the bootstraps (the original saying was trying to point out that its impossible), most success is because of a combination of luck, persistence, and surrounding yourself with people who are also trying to grow. You've got the persistence part down: you've given each idea a try and haven't given up and stopped trying new things.   Who do you know who you think will support you? What promising local resources (entrepreuer groups, meetups, guilds, societies, clubs, gyms, support groups) have you not tapped into yet? Who could you ask to be a gym partner, who could you ask to discuss business ideas over lunch, who could join you with making friends and expanding the pool of people who are potential dating parners?  One way to help yourself is by providing the support you need to others. There are a lot of volunteer opportunities, to personally help children, the elderly, or animals. When you were a child were you in scouts, sports, or some other group that was a positive experience, something that you could carry on now? Helping others will help you develope follow through, will distract you from ruminating on your own problems, and introduce you to people who are in the habit of helping people and may find a way to support you.  Also, what's really helped me was seeing a therapist, so that's worth a try too. The point is that there is hope, there are a lot of paths to choose and none of them are ""right"" or ""wrong"", what matters is that you choose something that feels right to you. No matter how many things fail, there will always be more options, or more times to give it a second try. Don't think of it as failing, think of it as growing. This is just the beginning of your life, not the end."

What has to happen before you are allowed to quit? This sets a limitation,  allowing you to become capable of handling everything within that limitation."

DecidingToBeBetter,32jyec,Crucifixian,9,Tue Apr 14 12:01:28 2015 UTC,"Let's do an exercise. Call it Meikami's Time Tested Get-Your-Life-Back-In-Focus Method.    Pause.   Take a breath. Take another.   Now, I want you to take some time and pretend you have nothing at all on your to-do list. Nothing anybody is waiting on you for, nothing you need to turn in, nothing you need to study for. You literally have not a thing that anyone or anything in the world needs from you. Nothing ""on your plate,"" so to speak. You're entirely, 100%, completely, free.   If it helps, picture yourself as an old man on a mountain peak who has achieved and accomplished all he will in his life, and now can just focus on breathing and smelling the clean air.   Take however long you need to get yourself in that mindset before continuing.     Now, very slowly, start looking at your life from the most basic, big things to start. Don't get ahead of yourself. Work your way through this list carefully.   Are you breathing? Good! Success there. High five to your body for working.   Did you eat today, or do you have access to some food? Great! Doing better than a lot of people out there. Keep going.   Got clean water to drink? Faaaantastic.   Do you have access to a place to sleep? Perfect!   Do you get enough sleep? If you're still not getting enough sleep with your 11pm schedule, this is the first thing to put back on your plate. Block out 8 hours (you may need more, you may need less, but at this point in your life you probably won't actually know what you need...so start with 8 for tonight) on your currently wide open calendar to sleep. Set an alarm for 9pm to turn of all of your electronic devices, screens, tv, etc. and get ready for bed. At 10:00, you will go to bed. Set another alarm for 6am, and get up then. With that as the only thing on your calendar so far, let's move on. Are you safe where you are? Nobody's coming after you to attack you, and you're not in danger of being harmed or robbed? Awesome. Again, you're doing better than a whole lot of people out there. Good job.  Are you healthy, for the most part? If not, make note of what you know is off, and what you can do each day to help keep you alive. Let go of ideals of how healthy you'd like to be for now, and just focus on maintaining a functioning body. No need to overachieve right now.    Alright! First part complete. You've established that you are succeeding at surviving, and even going beyond that. If you're alive, then there's no hope lost. You've still got time.   Now, while you're still in the mindset of nothing on your plate but the basic maintenance, start thinking, slowly, about the big picture of your life right now.    You're enrolled as a student. Ok. That's good! You're still enrolled, which means you've still got a chance at staying enrolled. Don't add anything about that back on your plate just yet. Just leave it at that for now.  Remember what you're in school for in the first place. Chasing a specific degree? Doing what is required to get into a certain career? Just getting school experience under your belt?  What other big things do you have influencing your life? Not things like assignments or individual classes, or self-imposed obligations like working out. I'm talking big things. Maintaining a marriage is a big thing. Going in for surgery is a big thing. Keeping a baby alive is a big thing. Having a job is a big thing. If you have any of those things, then you're going to need to put base level maintenance for THOSE things back on your plate like you did with base level maintenance of yourself. If you don't have those things going on right now...all the better! Less to worry about.  Do you have loved ones? You don't need lots of them. You mentioned you've got at least one person rooting you on; if you like you can count me in as another. That's good. How about your family? Siblings, parents, people there that you can lean on if you're in trouble? Acknowledge those people that are there for you if you need them. Remember that they are there and that they can help.  Think about other big-picture things about the stage of life you're in right now, and just make note that these are the things governing your life right now.   Okay. End of part two. Good work. Keep the clear headed mindset.  Before moving on, take these to heart. The facts of the matter are:    Failure is just another word for tripping up. You can trip and fall and stop, or keep going on. It is not a permanent state.    If you're alive, you've got nothing but time.    If you've got the basics covered, you're not failing.    The next part is the hardest. This is where you take that perspective and put it to work. You're going to need to look at all those ""big things"" in your life and, on a piece of paper, draw out a bubble diagram for each one of them. Then, starting from the most basic objectives at the biggest middle bubble and working your way to the smaller tasks out at the edges, write down the things that are your responsibilities. Focusing on the big things first (such as ""I am working towards X degree"") will keep things in perspective. Write down the things needed for each of those big things. For a degree, they'll usually involve things like get X number of credits in X number of things, and those will go in the first tier of bubbles. For a job, it'll involve show up X number of hours and get work done, and... that's about it for that diagram, to be honest. Since I know school, I'll focus on that part for the rest of this.   The next tier out on that school bubble diagram will include the individual classes. Make note of the minimum that you need to stay enrolled. Fit the minimum into the chart before all the others. Then step back and assess how much time is needed to get just the minimum requirements under control. Does that leave any time left in your week? If so, then add back in the things that go beyond the minimum one at a time.   The next tier out will involve the things for those classes that are needed. Big assignments, projects, etc.   Get those diagrams drawn out for the big things and assess how much time is needed for all of it. Understand that until or unless those big things are fulfilled,  you do NOT need to focus on anything else beyond the basics we talked about above. Your only objectives are to A) survive, and B) take care of the big things in your life.   You do NOT need to focus on being a successful cartoonist right now, so let go of that. It's okay. You'll have time for that later. You do NOT need to focus on anything else at all. Let go of that pressure right now.   Slowly and deliberately put things back your plate like cartooning and lifting, knowing that those are self-imposed things and that nobody else but you has been holding you to them. Give yourself permission to let go of that pressure. Once you've taken care of the basics in your life, the fun stuff works its way back in. Reddit, Facebook, games, whatever all come last in this big picture hierarchy...so don't let those come before the big things.  Now, take the time to chip away at those big things that need to happen.   If you need to take more time to complete them, ask for that time. (I myself had to stop and take an extra year in the middle of university to get caught up before continuing on with my degree program...which was scary, but in the end, WORTH IT.) Taking more time is NOT the worst thing in the world. Losing an opportunity that is important to you because you think you can't take longer to complete it? That's worse.   Breathe again. Exercise done.     Well that was a giant wall of text, wasn't it? Here's the TL;DR: Stop, breathe. Bring some perspective back in to your life by focusing on the really big picture, and don't let yourself add stressors to yourself unless that big picture is being taken care of.  It'll all work out. Promise."

Be brutally honest - even it sounds foolish. It may be physical, mental, occupational...etc.    Why do you dislike the point(s) above?     Is it something recently pointed out by others? Or perhaps, something that you simply don't want to be associated with?   What do you like about yourself and Why?   There has got to be something!  It's important to acknowledge your good traits too, so you don't lose them.    Hopefully this helps you gain insight on your thoughts, motivation, strengths and weaknesses.  This is what self awareness is all about.  As for next steps, find a comfortable process for self-introspection and do it routinely.  Some like journalling whereas others stare into a mirror.   A potential plan is to write in a journal 15 minutes each morning checking in on the previous day (did you meet your goals, what made your day great...) and the day ahead (goals...).

DecidingToBeBetter,32iuvk,Decemberistz,2,Tue Apr 14 06:09:48 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem, going through the same process. Recently a friend of mine told me that refusals are a thing I do badly. We were just having a relaxed conversation when she said ""Hey, there's a tennis field right next to my house, we should totally play sometime"". And I said ""I'm sorry, I won't"". Bear in mind I'm quite possibly the laziest person you know; sometimes I skip meals for a couple of days because I'm too lazy to get up and cook or even grab a packet of biscuits. She explained that even when I 100% don't intend to play, I should rather say ""Sure, sometime"" and then let her forget about it. Apparently saying no outright is rude because the person is excited about it, and it makes them less willing to invite me to things at another point. I personally would have thought lying is ruder but apparently your mileage may vary."
DecidingToBeBetter,32iuvk,bk7j,3,Tue Apr 14 08:25:35 2015 UTC,"That interaction may be a bit more complicated than it looks, which is why it seems so confusing.  Invitations often hold unspoken emotional messages along with the explicit verbal ones.  Here's how it might have gone in your friend's mind:  Friend: ""Hey, there's a tennis field right next to my house, we should totally play sometime.""  Translation: ""Hey, you're my friend and I am looking for something to do together.  Also, I like tennis and think that would be convenient and fun.""  So when you reply with ""I'm sorry, I won't,"" you think you're just replying to the tennis part, but it comes across as also pushing away the friendship.  When she says that she would rather hear ""Sure, sometime,"" she is (probably unconsciously) asking you to acknowledge that spending time together would be fun (and maybe tennis).   Since this can be confusing to people who try to communicate very literally, the option I prefer is to explicitly address the unspoken part of her first statement while being honest about not wanting to play tennis.  Here's how my refusal format goes:    Acknowledge that an invitation holds an unspoken message of friendship, and offer gratitude for that.  Offer regret that I am turning down the invitation, because refusals can hurt, even tiny, insignificant ones. Optionally suggest something that I would like to do (if it's a friend I actually want to do something with) to return the friendship message and keep lines open.    Something that fits this might be something like:  ""(1) Yeah, it would be great to do something together! (2) But I'm afraid I'm really not a tennis person. (3) Maybe we can bake some cookies together instead?""  Other examples:   ""Thanks for the party invite! I'm sorry I can't make it. Hopefully next time!"" ""I appreciate the offer from your company, but I'm afraid I must decline at this time."" ""I would love to meet up for drinks, but this Thursday doesn't work for me. Could we do Friday instead?""    In part 2, you don't actually have to give a reason for your declination.  However, if it's a good friendship, I find it best to be honest, as long as you do it gently.   She's right that just saying no will likely making people less interested in inviting you to things in the future, not because you aren't lying, but because you are shutting down the offer AND not offering anything in return.  Friendships involve give and take on both sides, even in little interactions like this.  I would use this same general method on a casual invitation from a friend, an invite to a business lunch, or to a big date.  The only change is in step 3: If i don't value the relationship all that highly, I may not offer anything in return."

But I want to warn you, because it can be disheartening while you're learning, that the first step to changing anything is being aware of the problem.    Right now it sounds like you aren't really aware of the things you do that might be socially awkward or rude, but other people are.  As you pay attention more, the first thing that will happen is that you'll become more aware of these things that you are doing (often after the fact), and it can be really depressing.  Sometimes it even feels like you're getting worse.   With practice, that awareness will gradually shift from something you feel helpless at doing to something you can ponder before it happens and make a choice about, and that's when positive changes start happening."

If the dude was busy with his hands or away from the register and you set it down on the counter and slid it to him when he looked up, its fine.  On the other hand, if you were looking him eye to eye and just set it on the counter in a ""go ahead pick it up"" kind of way, that would be rude.    I can miss social cues as well sometimes, but that shit is gonna happen.  Just do the best you can do and apologize if ya goof up."
DecidingToBeBetter,32iuvk,pomegranate2012,1 point,Tue Apr 14 08:21:31 2015 UTC,"Rather than focus on avoiding rudeness, try to practice being more polite. First impressions are really important to people, and what your doing really isn't outwardly rude; based on your example it might be that people are basing their opinion of you by your first interaction with them. I have a sort of 'polite mode' I practice when I'm speaking to coworkers or service workers where I make sure to let them know I'm not hostile or in a bad mood or something. Simple things like speaking with a smile or patiently waiting for a good spot for them to finish what they're focusing on before interacting with me. I'm a bit like you where I sometimes avoid speaking when I probably should, but really its just polite to interact and no one generally thinks its socially unacceptable to greet or acknowledge each other."
DecidingToBeBetter,32iuvk,pomegranate2012,-5,Tue Apr 14 18:37:21 2015 UTC,This is clearly a matter of not caring. People in the service industry complain about the most unbelievably petty things. It's 100% your choice how you pay a service guy. If he thinks you're being rude it's because he literally has nothing else to think about. One day he'll get a real job and real problems. Don't worry about it.

TLDR The point I am trying to make is that if you love yourself it can make up for not having certain things, and can be (one of) the greatest motivators for deciding to be better."

This ruined fiction for me and opened the door to a whole new world of awesome that is history, in addition to curing my anxiety. Forget Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings, listen to this, it's absolutely fascinating. Freakonomics radio: Give it a try, some episodes are really great. It's not really about economics, although that's what the title implies. Start by ""the suicide paradox"", it was really touching somehow. Hardcore History by Dan Carlin. You've probably heard of it elsewhere on reddit, the episodes are huge but this man is the greatest storyteller I've had the pleasure of listening to.  Fareed Zakaria's GPS.

I got tired of it so what did I do? I moved to the opposite side of the country and pushed myself to explore new things. I'm not saying you need to do that, I'm simply saying do whatever you possibly can to step out of your comfort zone. Getting stuck in the mindset of just being comfortable and not moving forward is very dangerous, and if you want to change then just do it. I know it is easier said than done, but just force yourself to do things you usually wouldn't do. Worst that happens is you don't like it and you can try something else.  tl;dr, try your hardest to step out of your comfort zone, it will be difficult, but it will make you feel like you have a purpose and that you did something to better yourself."

I am an introvert as well, and I understand how exhausting it can be to interact with people all day. I would say you're better off joining something. Maybe you always wanted to try boxing, find a boxing club near you and just head over. Or maybe you wanted to learn more about cooking, find a cooking class and join it. Do things that you think you might want to do, and that will force you into these situations that you're going to feel awkward in, but over time it will become comfortable. I would say if you don't need one, and nothing you really want to do is coming your way, hold off on the job for a bit. Work on yourself and find some things you really enjoy. The point is just to try new things for fun, and if they end up not being fun then you know and you can try something else."

DecidingToBeBetter,32l027,Khanthulhu,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"So - the complete drop in confidence that comes from some poor obese 12 year old with shitty parents who feed them shit and let them laze around all day - that's the kid's fault? They should just pull themselves up by the bootstraps, take up football, ignore the fact that the entire team hates his fat ass, ignore the helmets being thrown at him each day because ""he needs to take control of his life?""  And so he or anyone similar to him, who actually have less power to control it than you think deserves to be made fun of?   The vast majority of reddit users are adults and are fully capable of tending to their own physical and mental well-being. If you want to be fat, fine, be fat, but don't use genetics or a bad childhood as an excuse for not being able to improve yourself. That's a load of horseshit.   I understand ""tough love"" and ""not coddling"" people, but I also understand not being a fucking prick when someone is struggling with something, and I understand that positive reinforcement is much more sustaining than negative reinforcement.   Different people respond differently to different types of motivation. Some people need to be kicked in the ass. Positive reinforcement isn't always universally effective. I don't frequent the subreddit, but I've definitely seen multiple self-posts from people thanking /r/fatpeoplehate for motivating them to change. If it isn't for you, fine, move on find something else that speaks to you. If it makes you mad or upset, good, maybe you'll be motivated to change. If it demotivates you, then you're weak and looking for an excuse to fail; it's as simple as that.   you don't think a lot of people here are formerly fat or currently fat? Do you think they'd be here if ignoring all that shit and becoming better was that accessible?   It is accessible. If it wasn't accessible, this subreddit wouldn't exist. This subreddit serves as a primary means to give people drive to become better, because it's always possible. Fatpeoplehate does the same thing but in an obviously much more abrasive manner."

So has the idea that there is health at every size or that people who try to encourage people to have a healthy body that exercises and eats healthy are "" the problem "" . There is a problem with rising obesity in the world and some people want to address this problem and others do not. I think people who are actively encouraging people to be fat are people who may be worthy not of hate maybe but definitely of social rejection. Actively encouraging people to be fat is things like saying that one can be healthy at any body size, that encouraging people to lose weight causes anorexia, that people who are too fat to fit on a plane seat shouldn´t be obliged to pay for an extra seat, and the whole THIN PRIVILEGE thing which is the stupidest thing I´ve ever heard.

They claim to simply be annoyed at the arrogance of fat people, but the copious use of the term ""condishun"" and hypotheticals and strawmen suggests that they just hate fat people.   The sub is huge, and they spill out everywhere. Try to cite science articles upon articles upon articles supporting why it's hard to lose weight? ""Quit making excuses, fatass."" This happens everywhere on reddit. They'd much rather discuss the merits of ""calories in vs. calories out"" over the complexities of satiety, psychology, why overeating happens, and every other nuance that goes into understanding the complex nature of food, our metabolism, diets, and activities.   They're some of the dumbest people on Reddit. Armed with the simplicity of calorie counting, they look to put down whomever they can because they for some reason cannot live with themselves.   That negativity sucks. You either feel bad about yourself because of it, or you become a horrible person to others, and in turn, an asshole. Good on you for cutting it out of your life.

But remember, trying to undermine another's choices does nothing to justify our own. Decide what is right for you, and stand by that choice... or change your mind if and when you feel compelled.

Are you referring to the term ""Farm Sanctuary"" being a sanctuary for farms? Are you saying that the non-profit feeds their animals poorly? Or engaged in wasteful feed practices? I'm not trying to be difficult, I'm honestly having trouble following the premise of your comment.  If you feel like clarifying your position, I'm genuinely interested. Thanks, and yeah, I think they're doing pretty great work too."
DecidingToBeBetter,32d36e,Kafke,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"Serious?   Absolutely. Killing plants instead of animals is not a morally superior position. If you want to play the ""I'm more moral than you"" game, then go eat soylent for every meal. It's vegan, and reduces the amount of consumed life. The idea is to eventually get it to be as efficient as possible, with the goal being to only require water and light to make.   And through this process people that eat animals are eating WAY more plants.   So? The issue is discrimination, not volume. Even if you cut out factory farming completely, there's still thousands of animals being killed daily for food. And there's even more plants being killed. If you are using this argument, you are literally not allowed to have a pet, since it'd be immoral (since animals eat plants).  The issue is hypocrisy; avoiding eating a specific thing for one reason, but not applying that reason to everything you eat.   Eating plants is both an inevitability to sustain life on this planet   It actually does more harm than good. To sustain life, the ideal move would be to not have children and go kill yourself. Reducing your usage to 0. Most people over consume almost everything, not just food. If you are going for the ""it's better for the planet route"", you must necessarily not be using a computer right now, since not only was slave labor required to make that computer, but it also requires energy to run which burns fossil fuels. A much larger strain on the environment than eating animals.  You must also walk to work, since bikes cost materials and energy, and cars are the largest consumption of fossil fuels.  Food is only a tiny bit of that. And again, you should go all the way and eat 100% soylent, since the entire idea is to reduce strain on the environment and work towards sustainability.   and morally just,   Discriminating against particular types of life is not just. Regardless of how you put it.   given the lack of a nervous system and consciousness.   Using this argument you must agree that you'd be fine chopping off a paraplegic's legs to eat, and to kill and eat people in a vegetative state and/or coma (that are on life support). The paraplegics don't use and can't feel their legs (making it fine to eat). And those on life  support are a huge drain on the environment, and can't feel their bodies anyway.  Seems fucked up if you are okay with eating these. Yet, that's the position you are endorsing. You should also have no problems with non-factory farmed animals, considering no suffering is going on (with the nervous system).  It's also worth noting that plants do react to being attacked, and have various defense mechanisms. Which is why we can't eat every plant. Or, if we do, we have to do a fuck ton of stuff to make it actually edible.  Again, if you want a plant-focused diet, you'd go with being a 'fruitarian' (like steve Jobs was  for a while) and only eat fruit from plants, which are made specifically to be eaten (by the plant).   But remember, trying to undermine another's choices does nothing to justify our own.   Of course. I certainly agree with your position that factory farming should be reduced. I just don't think ethical veganism is a morally coherent view. That's like using all-wood products because you want to reduce human slave labor. It doesn't make any fucking sense. It's still bad. It's just not directly causing problems for an animal (but still impacts the world, and still harms living things).   Decide what is right for you, and stand by that choice... or change your mind if and when you feel compelled.   I have issues with hypocritical views. Not ""morally evil"" ones. If you have a consistent view and follow that view, I have no problems. I might think you're a bit strange, but you'd be okay in my book.   Expending our time and energy trying to poke holes in other people's life choices is a waste of both.   I'm not trying to poke holes in your life choices. I'm poking at the name of the charity (which I'm not particularly fond of organized charities either, for a different reason).  As I mentioned in my original comment, it's a noble goal. Factory farming certainly is a problem, but not because it's ""ethically wrong"". All the ethics would be perfectly fine provided the animals were treated humanely, produced only to meet a quota, and weren't abused. There'd still be problems, but that'd get rid of the ethics problems."

Once again, considering the plant's inability to feel pain (based upon our scientific understanding of how pain is transmitted via the nervous system), one could make a strong argument that eating plants is absolutely a moral superior position. Less pain. Also, a vegetarian/vegan is destroying fewer plants than a carnist. Less harm. If such a thing exists as moral superiority, one could make a cogent argument toward exactly that in this case.   go eat soylent for every meal   I do eat soylent though not for every meal. Anyway, soylent is made with oat flour (a plant) and a LOT of other plants. What do you think is in it? And if you don't ask for vegan, there is fish oil in it too. FYI.   The idea is to eventually get it to be as efficient as possible, with the goal being to only require water and light to make.   Whose idea? Yours? I know a lot of vegans whose main concern isn't efficiency. And you use this exact assumption to argue your next three paragraphs.   If you are going for the ""it's better for the planet route"", you must necessarily not be using a computer right now,    Why? You're pushing this agenda that any harm done invalidates any harm avoided. The size of the footprint is the issue, not the fact that we have one. Based on your argument, you think that human beings should apologize for their existence. I disagree. We can be better earthlings, but we're allowed to be here.   To sustain life, the ideal move would be to not have children and go kill yourself.   Ironic.   Even if you cut out factory farming completely, there's still thousands of animals being killed daily for food.   Yes. Very true, but factory farming is the biggest contributor. Try to make the biggest difference you can. We're a long way from where we want to be.   And there's even more plants being killed.    In this context, I'm not concerned with plants being killed. While your moral argument is shaky at best, it is, at the very least, far from the biggest concern at hand. No, I don't want the Amazon burned to the ground. But I don't think there is an ethical issue with eating plants in a responsible manner.   Using this argument you must agree that you'd be fine chopping off...   First of all, this is so disgusting I can't even retype it. Secondly, this is a strawman argument. Both of the people that you mention eating have nervous systems and/or consciousnesses.   You should also have no problems with non-factory farmed animals, considering no suffering is going on (with the nervous system).   Really? Being killed long before your natural death isn't suffering? See my response above regarding factory farms vs family farms.   I just don't think ethical veganism is a morally coherent view...It doesn't make any fucking sense. It's still bad. It's just not directly causing problems for an animal (but still impacts the world, and still harms living things).   Your general argument can be reduced to ""using any resources at all is morally reprehensible"". I don't find an ethical dilemma in sustaining my own life, provided I'm avoiding causing pain and harm to other intelligent beings (as being denoted primarily by the existence of a nervous system). In your efforts toward an argument, you've concluded that corn and soybeans are intelligent life. I respectfully disagree.  In addition, I don't feel that an effort toward doing good has to be defensed against not being perfect.   All the ethics would be perfectly fine provided the animals were treated humanely, produced only to meet a quota, and weren't abused. There'd still be problems, but that'd get rid of the ethics problems.   I disagree. Once again, killing an intelligent creature, one that feels happiness and pain, for any reason beyond defense (a bear is attacking my family) is not ethical in my view. It's not about over-consumption. That is important, but not the root of the problem. Humans can live perfectly healthy lives without killing animals, (therefore it is not required) and animals are intelligent creatures that deserve the right to live their own lives. If there is a ""quota"" of animals to be killed, we are still doing it wrong.  Overall, I feel like you misrepresent my argument pretty drastically to make your own. But hey, if you don't like the name of the charity, you don't have to. Thanks for taking the time to discuss."
DecidingToBeBetter,32d36e,trancematik,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:40:39 2015 UTC,"Once again, considering the plant's inability to feel pain (based upon our scientific understanding of how pain is transmitted via the nervous system), one could make a strong argument that eating plants is absolutely a moral superior position.    Except that entirely depends on how you define 'pain'. To rephrase what you just said: ""Killing and maiming plants is fine, since they are biologically structured differently than humans."" Which I can't say is any morally superior than ""No, gay people can't get married, because they are biologically structured differently than straight people.""  And again, there are people who can't feel pain. Plenty of them. Does that mean eating them is fine? You can't use ""doesn't feel pain"" as an argument if you reject the notion of eating something that doesn't feel pain. It's an inconsistent position.   Less pain.   Same goes for coma patients, people who can't feel pain, etc.   Also, a vegetarian/vegan is destroying fewer plants than a carnist.   I didn't reject that. I'm saying ethical veganism isn't a self-consistent view. I have no problems eating people, animals, or plants. Because living things need to eat other living things to survive. That's how biology works.   If such a thing exists as moral superiority, one could make a cogent argument toward exactly that in this case.   By claiming you are a vegan for ethical reasons means you are trying to take a morally superior position. I'm calling bullshit on that. I'm not saying 'eating animals is morally superior'. I'm saying that applying no discrimination to what you eat is more self-consistent than discriminating about what you eat, and then not being consistent with the discrimination.  You can't say you are reducing suffering by eating more plants instead of animals. You are still harming and killing the plants.   Anyway, soylent is made with oat flour (a plant) and a LOT of other plants.    Is it? Could you give some links? From what I can tell, the idea is to reduce any need of actual farming/killing, and rely solely on renewable resources. It might not be there quite yet, but that's the goal. And removing all animal products is the first step (which just happened). It's fairly new, so give it time.   What do you think is in it?   Various ingredients that can be acquired by many ways. Though, I'm having a hard time finding where the ingredients are sourced from. So if you could send a link or something, that'd be awesome. I do know that the goal (as stated by the guy who made it) is to ""make food out of water and light, like plants do"". I also know that with each iteration, less actual required resources are needed. And that the newest version is vegan friendly.  If you were eating based on moral reasons (not wanting to kill anything), soylent is your best bet at the moment. And I plan to make the switch to it as soon as I get my current living situation in order.   And if you don't ask for vegan, there is fish oil in it too.   There's only a single ""option"". There's not vegan/non-vegan options. It's all just a single thing. No fish oil.   Whose idea?   The guy who made it. That's literally the whole point. To remove any 'fluff' time used in the preparation and consumption of food. All the way from gathering the resources to actually preparing and consuming the food. Efficient and sustainable.   I know a lot of vegans whose main concern isn't efficiency.    The way I see it, there's only a couple reasons to actually be vegan. The first is the sustainability problem. Large-scale farming as a whole is unsustainable (both plants and animals). And there's a lot of food going to waste (so much, that if we simply distributed the current food in america properly, there'd be no one starving). Switching to a vegan diet reduces the strain in terms of animals. And depending on the plants consumed, may reduce it in general. Then there's the health reasons. Which I'm not entirely sure if those are valid.  As you'd still need supplements and such to ensure all the nutrients are obtained. And then lastly, there's the ethical reasons. Which I call bullshit on for the reasons i've outlined.  All three of those are solved by soylent. As the entire point is to increase sustainability, increase the health quality of people's general diet, and to allow people to eat ethically.   You're pushing this agenda that any harm done invalidates any harm avoided.   No, I'm saying you should have a consistent worldview.   Based on your argument, you think that human beings should apologize for their existence.   Nope. I'm saying you should be honest and have a consistent worldview that you act upon. And I'm saying that you shouldn't say you are doing something to try and 'look good' (kill and eat plants to avoid killing animals). If your goal is to reduce suffering and killing things, then don't kill anything. Period. It's as simple as that. If you have a problem with fiat currency, don't use it. If you think living an unsustainable life is wrong, then don't live one.   Ironic.   Isn't it? That's how horribly inefficient and unsustainable humans are. That it'd literally be better for every thing else if we just died or disappeared.   Yes. Very true, but factory farming is the biggest contributor. Try to make the biggest difference you can. We're a long way from where we want to be.   Sure. I agree with reducing and removing factory farming. I just don't think doing it for 'ethical reasons' is valid. And if you really want to push the view, you should also realize that unless you buy directly from the factory farms, you really don't make a bit of difference, since the stores already buy the meat and do so at a consistent rate.   I'm not concerned with plants being killed.   And I'm not concerned with eating any and all life. I find discrimination to be the larger problem. Animals don't discriminate. They just eat what they need to eat. And then they are later eaten by something else. I don't see that as a problem. What I do see as a problem is arbitrary categorization simply to try and give yourself a moral pedestal.   While your moral argument is shaky at best, it is, at the very least, far from the biggest concern at hand.   I agree. Which is why it shouldn't be your reason for being vegan. The ""suffering of living things"" is by far not even close to the reason anyone should do anything. There's much more pressing matters.   No, I don't want the Amazon burned to the ground. But I don't think there is an ethical issue with eating plants in a responsible manner.   This is a direct conflict in your worldview. Are you, or are you not okay with plants being exploited and killed for human benefit?  As far as eating goes. It's identical to animals. As I mentioned. You are still killing something solely for human benefit. I see no reason why you should pick one or the other exclusively.   Both of the people that you mention eating have nervous systems and/or consciousnesses.   Well the guy in a coma isn't conscious (and thus also can't feel pain). And the guy who can't feel his legs obviously can't feel them be amputated (and it's not like he uses them anyway).  So if you are using the ""pain receptors is what matters"" then you should be fine with eating the coma guy and the legs of the paraplegic. You should also be fine with eating the people who can't feel pain (it's a disorder). Since ""pain receptors"" are what you are using as your guideline for what's okay to eat.  See the problem? Plants are just like those guys. Sure, they might not have pain receptors like humans or other animals. But they still have reactions to pain. And they are still living.  Basically by still wanting to eat plants, but not these other things, you are saying ""Plants don't look like animals and people, so it's okay to kill and eat them"". Which is fucking absurd.   Being killed long before your natural death isn't suffering?    Pain receptors aren't being triggered, so according to you, yes. Also worth noting that death isn't necessarily a bad thing. You are assuming it is.   Your general argument can be reduced to ""using any resources at all is morally reprehensible"".   Not quite. Using resources necessarily increases suffering. At least at the moment. Regardless of the method you choose. If you want to reduce suffering, you must not use resources. Otherwise you get a morally conflicting view.   In your efforts toward an argument, you've concluded that corn and soybeans are intelligent life. I respectfully disagree.   Depends on what you mean by intelligent.   Once again, killing an intelligent creature, one that feels happiness and pain, for any reason beyond defense (a bear is attacking my family) is not ethical in my view.   So now you are discriminating once again. Putting one life above another. See? This is the problem. You discriminate when convenient, and to try and obtain a moral pedestal. That's the problem. If you are okay killing the bear in defense, you should be okay killing the bear to eat. Otherwise you have an inconsistent view.   Humans can live perfectly healthy lives   They can do so without killing plants as well. Therefore it is not required.   and animals are intelligent creatures that deserve the right to live their own lives.   And plants don't deserve the right? Why not? Apparently that bear you killed didn't deserve the right either. I don't understand your hypocritical view.   If there is a ""quota"" of animals to be killed, we are still doing it wrong.   There's always a quota. At least until we remove the need to kill things entirely.   I feel like you misrepresent my argument pretty drastically to make your own.   Your point is that we should discriminate what we kill so..... I don't know. I don't know why you would discriminate.   But hey, if you don't like the name of the charity, you don't have to.

We partner with charity: water, which is an incredible non-profit based out of New York. It is a totally home-grown effort and we've been working on it and preparing for around 8 months now.

The question you need to be asking yourself is not would a random, generic person be happier through following this lifestyle, but would you be happier -- and that's a question you can only answer by trying it. If you give it a fair shake and it works for you, then great. If you give it a fair shake and it doesn't, then try something new, and keep trying something until you find a system that works.  It's good that you're trying to find a solution, and there's nothing wrong with aiming big. The important thing is that you remain open to fine-tuning your system until it meets your needs."

Now at least I know a reward system doesn't help and big lists and complicated schemes make me focus more on the lists and schemes than on the changes I want to make.

DecidingToBeBetter,32bwdl,akb47,3,Tue Apr 14 23:49:18 2015 UTC,Yes. It definitely is going to be hard though. Most people here will recommend baby steps but I recommend drastic change. Just attempt it for one day to see how it goes. Also why 6:30am? That seems way too early. Chances are you are a night-owl by nature and you will function better by waking up at 8:00 am and going to sleep at around 11 pm. (I think it's the perfect time to wake up unless you have an early job) Also consistent wake up times are very important if you want a consistent sleep schedule. Don't give yourself extra time on weekends. Instead wake up everyday at the same time.  This is going to be very tough to keep up at first. But if you keep at it for a week you will build new habits.

DecidingToBeBetter,32abfc,Zenix95,4,Sun Apr 12 04:13:46 2015 UTC,"Change your mindset.   Initially, it's (possibly) going to be uncomfortable to put yourself into new situations to meet new people. It'll get easier the more you do it. Look for clubs in any hobbies/interests of yours, even if it's as simple as a walking group. I've found the easiest way to meet a stranger is to smile with a friendly ""hi I'm ChaoticBonsai, and you are?""   Be willing to open up (at least a little) to strangers to form those friendships.  Also take an honest interest in other people. Actually give a damn about them - meaning if you ask ""how are you doing"", listen and care about what they have to say. Ask about careers, dreams, aspirations, fears, family, favorite foods, books, or whatever feels ""right"". Suggest making plans to meet up for [insert activity]. Don't be afraid of rejection. It happens, and it is not the end of the world. Life will go on.   Stop beating yourself up. The first best friend you need is yourself. Suppose a friend said the same thing as what you posted, ""it's too late for me!"", ""I wasted my 20s"", etc. What would you tell your friend? What advice would you give? I doubt you'd continue to berate your friend, so don't do that to yourself. Stop worrying about the perceived notion of what your life ""should"" be like.   You're human, you'll make mistakes, and not everyone you meet is going to like you. And all of that is ok. Stay true to yourself, and those that stick around will like you because you're you."

DecidingToBeBetter,32abfc,threequincy,6,Sun Apr 12 07:21:14 2015 UTC,"Quick point I want to make is that I don't beleive for a second that it's too late for guys like us to make improvements to our life. It would just be nice if there was someone whose already done it that could shed light on overcoming the obstacles that come along with starting late.  Late-blooming is a unique experience that's different from trying to improve your social life in your late-teens early twenties. There's so much negative self-talk that revolves around things like ""It's too late for me"" ""I should have been doing this years ago"", you start obsessing over missed opportunities, fear of exposing yourself as a late-bloomer, fear of the shame that comes along with that.  Also society has sort of unanimously agreed on time-frames for which you're ""supposed"" to do things that don't neccessarily correlate with reality. For example your high-school/college years are your ""party years"" and your 20s are about ""discovering your identity"" and your 30s are about ""establishing yourself"".  So for guys like us it's hard because there's no way for us to operate in the paradigm. We have to break ALL the rules to improve. We have to become outliers. Which to me is fine and like every obstacle in life has it's unique advantage.  I feel SO optimistic that there's a way out it would just be nice if there was someone whose already done it who could share experiences to help us relate to. And there is stuff out there, it's just so hard to find."

He was surrounded by like-minded people who also liked to go out and felt OK.

DecidingToBeBetter,32abfc,DrPoopingPooperson,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:46:47 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar situation. I started realising that something is wrong about two years into college, when I was about 22. To put things in perspective, I had a couple of friends from high school, but we didn't meet very often. For certain reasons (which have passed away with time) meeting with them just didn't work at that time. I found myself almost totally alone. I was the guy who would stand in the hallway between lectures at Uni and just pretend to write messages on his phone so that I look busy. All the other people were gathering around, chatting, etc. but usually - not me. But I was in a fairly good position. I was studying psychology at that time, so at least I knew the theory of what is going on (more or less), I knew how, theoretcally, friendships work (although be aware that psychology students don't focus on studying study friendships a lot, it's just one of the small themes), and maybe I had some tools to start working on change. It gave me a mindset of putting the responsibility to change on myself. It also made me realise that there are some things that cannot be changed - like being an introvert. It's an almost biological thing. But! there are plenty of well-functioning, social introverts, so there was (is) hope.  It took a long time before I learnt how to take action to change this. The most important thing, I think, is introspection. The second most important is action. At least it works for me. It made me realise that it was my self who was making it difficult. In the beginning of college I rarely accepted invitations to parties/get togethers/casual meetings. I never came out with an initiative to meet with people (because who would want to meet up with me? [don't think like that]). So soon people just kinda accepted that, and gradually stopped inviting me, as they formed their own groups and friendships. And that's just one of the factors. When we go deeper, we find anxiety, self esteem, untrue presumptions about other people, etc.  I was always socially awkward, but I started persistently putting myself out there. There are lots of advice on the internet, and not all of it is good for you, but I gained a lot from it. For example, how important it is to try to simply have fun and be outcome independent. Getting out of bad feelings about yourself (you can check out cognitive-behavioral therapy for that, and I don't mean necesserily to go into therapy, but just to get yourself familiar with the principles - they are surprisingly uplifting sometimes). It's all about putting work and effort into it. You will probably fail many times, just like me, but in general, you will be getting better at this.  I can't say I know exactly what I'm talking about, because I still have a long way to go, but I guess I made significant progress that I'm happy about. If you have any questions or something, go ahead.  tl;dr I was on the same page as you a couple of years ago. Start reading up, take the advice you get, but don't accept it blindly. Work on it, work on it, work on it, keep persistently putting yourself out there. Don't expect immediate success. Be critical, but kind to yourself.  edit. As for specific book recommendations, I think it could be interesting to look into CBT (Judith Beck and her books about depression or anxiety) and social pschology, if you are interested in some cool theory (http://www.amazon.co.uk/Social-Psychology-Elliot-Aronson/dp/0131786865 this one is particularly well written, really pleasure to read). This is true scientific shit, but in a very easy language. If you're not sure if you trust a random blogger, here you will find only truth."

DecidingToBeBetter,328g0a,mrgeof,32,Sat Apr 11 15:52:56 2015 UTC,"Yep:   Some of the tell-tale signs of meth abuse include sores, scabs and acne on the face.  Meth causes many users to feel a crawling sensation under their skin (called “formication”), causing them to pick obsessively at their faces. Heavy meth usage cuts off the supply of blood to all parts of the body, which destroys blood vessels.  The result is acne, sores and scabs that can dramatically alter a meth user’s appearance.  Meth suppresses the immune system, leading to slower healing of acne, meth sores and scabs, and the skin loses its luster and elasticity as a result of decreased blood flow.  Heavy meth users often look years or even decades older than their actual age.  In one of the most circulated and shocking slide shows ever distributed, the Multnomah County Sheriff compiled a series of mug shots showing the before and after pictures of meth users.  The photos are testaments to how dramatically meth can affect the appearance of users.   http://www.livingsober.com/why-meth-users-have-sores-and-scabs-on-their-faces/"

I suppose in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter, but when I look at myself and my goals, it just wouldn't line up with what I want in life. Then there's the ego where I think  I could get away with it once, just for the experience, and then beat it and never use it again. Maybe some of these people also fell into that trap?

It just feels so good, they don't stop using it. Avoiding the come down for days and drinking soda while on it cause a lot of that decay.  Opiates like heroin are a bit different. You've all likely met many people on opiates without knowing at all, since it's such an internal thing.  In a perfect simulation, you could arguably do pure heroin forever. If it was an endless steady supply with prepackaged doses. But that's not the world, people start withdrawal, they do stupid things. They steal to get more, they take more than before since they didn't realize their tolerance dropped while locked up or dry, etc.   Just saying, as someone who's been down those roads (not anymore thankfully), that video doesn't fully handle all of the hell that is meth.

If these are morally ok than so is any other substance. If you use any of these you cannot reasonably take a stance against any other drugs other than to say they are illegal or perceived as potentially harmful.

Hell most people I know have tried coke, pot and the likes - and besides by proxy I don't know anyone that have gotten fucked up by any drug (at least more so than being addicted to nicotine).  It is a massive shame however when some does get lost to drugs and two friends have lost family due to Heroin and it is the worst fucking thing esp. given how wretched the life is to the addict and those that care about him/her.

Nearly all of these people are obviously HARD drug users so I think that's something you should include in the title. 2. Some of these photos were taken 5 or more years apart. Of course they're going to look older! 3. Just like when ad companies take pictures of people who look ""ugly"", slap a little make up on them and say it's because of their ""new and improved acne cream"" or whatever, police stations and agencies are pretty well known for doing the same thing in reverse; taking attractive/normal looking people and then taking another picture after they've found them strung out for 4 days lying down in a pile of dirt. Have you ever seen someone right after a huge meth binge? it's terrifying, but they look much better after they've had a few days to recover.  Now I'm not saying go out and do hard drugs, far from it, please don't. But let me just say psychedelics have made me a lot better person to date and helped so much with depression. And I doubt that's going to resonate with anyone on here but I just think these photos are the adult version of D.A.R.E. and you're going to see them and think total abstinence is the only option for you because you don't want to look like a meth-head.

Once an addictive personality develops (primarily lack of self-discipline), there are many addictive behaviors.  For my son it could have been pot, alcohol, porn, etc. but his choice of addiction is online video games & he's destroying his college career and hence his future that way. Not to say all video games, drugs, alcohol, porn, etc. are bad, but for people with addictive personalities they absolutely can lead to destructive behaviors.  That is a fact.    It's be great if Redditors could somehow elevate the discussion above pointless arguments about addictive ""things,"" and address addictive behaviors, addictive triggers, behavior therapy, coping mechanisms, developing healthy habits, etc. instead."

If you get bored with a topic, don't abandon it, just take a break for a bit and revisit it later.  You may just be a little burnt out.     Also in my own experience I tend to stay much more interested in subjects if I am active in communities that discuss the subject.  Go ask questions and participate in discussions with people who are also interested in that field. It's not bad to want to see what else is out there though."

You'd have to be insane to get bored with that rate of change of pace. It feels like holding on to a steaming locomotive. Something boring and calm might be nice sometimes is what I'm saying. Mind you, I might regret that if I did that too :p   Mostly, just find something you can find satisfaction in. Not interest, satisfaction. It's like a carpenter making a chair - it's not always creative, but you get to look at the thing you've made and know you've done a good job. This thing is going to help someone, it's going to be a little piece of their life from now on. Find that feeling.

Every month I set about doing something new and interesting and honestly one year feels like a life time!  I think if you follow the ""traditional"" path of getting old, your years definitely go by very very quickly. But time seems to slow down significantly if you're always experiencing something new and achieving new things while pushing your own boundaries.  An example: A few months ago, I decided I would make a website for a specific purpose. I worked on that thing for 7 days, but it felt like a month had gone by! I also enjoyed every moment of it."

I do think it's important to give subjects/professions a fair chance, though. In my experience, it's hard to know whether you're a good fit for a career unless you've done it for at least a year. Every job is going to have boring parts, as others have said. Work is always going to be work.  It's also important to remember that actual careers are different than the academic subjects behind them.What you're good at academically also won't necessarily be what you're good at in the working world. While you're still young, get internships in fields that interest you. It's short-term too, so no ""job hopping"" blemish on your resume if you find out something isn't a good fit."

Don't attach yourself to a path, do a lot of things and eventually you will find something that is in tune with your values and is enjoyable in the simplest possible way. Do have a sense of leadership though, don't spread too thin, unless that satisfies you.  I've seen a night-shift janitor who expressed inner joy, not because he enjoyed it. He was grateful that he can pay the bills and eventually have his kids go to a proper school. He was grateful that some people gave him compliments as of how clean the place was.

DecidingToBeBetter,326a2c,flodnak,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:26:15 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like you're describing two problems.  The first is that you're afraid of limiting your options. Good news! You don't have to spend the rest of your life in the same job. The days when that was normal are long gone. You'll probably change careers, maybe more than once. It's not only acceptable, it's expected. So don't worry about the rest of your life - worry about right now.   Boredom is a more complicated problem. Some boredom is inevitable. Every job that has any degree of responsibility comes with meetings, and the simple fact is that there will be meetings where 90% of the agenda has nothing to do with you and your job, but for reasons which shall ever remain mysterious, you need to be there anyway. Every job has paperwork, and much of it will be routine, and the point of it will often be unclear. But it will still be expected of you. Every job comes with some boredom. Life comes with boredom. The universe is not here to entertain us.  But other times, boredom has a lot to do with attitude. So your boss sent you to a seminar for something you know how to do already. You can look at it as being sentenced to three days of boredom. You can look at it as paying a price of three days of your time now in return for opportunities for more interesting tasks later. You can look at it as a chance to make sure you really understand the fundamentals. Heck, I remember playing a mental game back in high school: How would I explain whatever the teacher is talking about to a Martian who landed in my backyard?   As for me, I knew I wanted to keep learning for the rest of my life, so I became a teacher. My husband had the same goal when he became an engineer. Both of us have to do work that bores us on a regular basis, but neither of us are ever bored with our jobs - and that makes all the difference."

I have a terrible attention span, but then at moments I can sit and obsessively concentrate on things (like minecraft or youtube...or when I'm lucky, violin practicing) for hours. The goal is, of course,  to gradually replace the bad obsessions with the good ones."

DecidingToBeBetter,31y6ke,Creshfollows,2,Mon Apr 13 01:41:44 2015 UTC,"1) Set one goal in each area. 2) Buy a notebook and write a plan for each goal. Break it down in to the smallest steps. Put a box next to each step. 3) Start with the first step. When you finish, check the box and move to the next step. 4) When you finish all the steps for a goal, make a new goal and repeat.  It takes some discipline to write out all the steps, but once you do that part it's kind of like a game to accomplish them and check them off. I've done a lot of things I otherwise wouldn't have. It helps to have really specific goals (instead of saying ""lose weight""  you can say ""lose 15 pounds in two months"").

You've got a job, look for acting and musically related stuff. Force yourself outside of your comfort zone. Reality is always going to be subpar compared to our dreams, but if we work towards our dreams we can make them a reality.   You've been through some shit. That's good, as crazy as it may sound. Adversity builds character. Everyone who has ever ""made it"" has been through some serious shit.   Tomorrow, I dare you to do a Google search for acting or improv classes near you. You don't even have to click on any of the links. Then next week I dare you to look at one of the websites. Then the week after I dare you to drive past in your car. Then go inside. Keep pushing yourself. I swear to god, if you have the balls to do a Google search that will lead you towards following your dreams, you will start down a road that will be greater than anything you could have imagined. And it'll be real.   It's going to be scary. It's going to make you uncomfortable. Just remember that anyone doing anything for the first time is always uncomfortable. Always always.   I believe in you. You came here to seek help and the best help you can give is to yourself.

People who spend a significant amount of time on Facebook daily are more likely to be depressed because they're comparing their daily life to everyone else's highlight reel. You're doing the same to an even greater degree. Now your coping mechanism is the reason you need a coping mechanism. If you have a job and a decent place to live, and this is your greatest concern right now (not to imply that it's not a worthy concern), your life probably has a lot of potential for happiness, but you'll never appreciate it while you're competing with a fantasy superhuman.  For all of these reasons you have to find a way to start seeing a professional. Willpower and frustration alone probably won't get you out of this hole.

Conscious fantasy of article  Fantasy %28psychology%29:       A fantasy is a situation imagined by an individual that expresses certain desires or aims on the part of its creator. Fantasies sometimes involve situations that are highly unlikely; or they may be quite realistic. Fantasies can also be sexual in nature. Another, more basic meaning of fantasy is something which is not 'real,' as in perceived explicitly by any of the senses, but exists as an imagined situation of object to subject.  In everyday life, individuals often find their thoughts pursue a series of fantasies concerning things they wish they could do or wish they had done...fantasies of control or of sovereign choice...daydreams'.   George Eman Vaillant in his study of defence mechanisms took as a central example of 'an immature defence...fantasy — living in a ""Walter Mitty"" dream world where you imagine you are successful and popular, instead of making real efforts to make friends and succeed at a job'.  Fantasy, when pushed to the extreme, is a common trait of narcissistic personality disorder; and certainly 'Vaillant found that not one person who used fantasy a lot had any close friends'.

DecidingToBeBetter,31r13g,Literally_Badass,5,Wed Apr 8 04:52:55 2015 UTC,"I also recommend that you reduce your list of goals, but if you really want to try this list I'd say break each of these goals down to one simple little actionable item. For instance ""Learn a new language"" becomes ""learn a new word"". Then make a daily checklist of all these little items. Your goal is now this; Check one of the items every day. If you do more, great, but one is your goal. Every morning the list is reset. With time you can try for more checks each day or make the items on your checklist more difficult. And don't be afraid to drop goals completely if they don't seem interesting anymore.  This way every day is a step towards your goals. And every day a small victory."
DecidingToBeBetter,31r13g,Niccofyren,6,Tue Apr 7 16:44:48 2015 UTC,"I'll chime in with the advice already given. Start small.  Instead of telling you what you should start with because everyone will have an opinion, find what you think is easiest.  Start there. Give yourself leniency, take a cold shower for instance. If you need to take a hot shower 4 days in, allow yourself to, day number 5 turn that hot water down again."
DecidingToBeBetter,31r13g,afderrick,3,Tue Apr 7 16:22:50 2015 UTC,"Check out Duolingo for the language. There's a great app and you can also play on your browser. It lets you set daily goals and will buzz you with reminders (which you can turn off if it's annoying).   Duolingo turns language learning into a game, you have lives that you'll lose if you get questions wrong, and you'll win exp and lingots which you can use to buy alternative lessons like 'flirting' or idioms.  If you're able to, I'd recommend using duolingo in conjunction with something like rosetta stone or maybe memrise. News in Slow French has been good for me, and I know there's also at least a spanish version. Lastly, movies and tv can be a good way to wrap your head around the pronunciation. Kids shows are best, since they speak slowly and enunciate each word.   You also included public speaking and improvisation. For that I think you'd do well to check out your local community college. Where I am, the classes are quite cheap to begin with, and financial aid is super easy to get. Some people I know even end up with surplus cash thanks to unused book/lunch/travel allowances. The speech class I took really gave me a lot of confidence in my speaking, and was actually tons of fun. While you're enrolling in classes, you might see something else you're interested in to get out of that comfort zone. Engine repair classes will almost certainly pay for themselves throughout your life, and some schools even offer stuff like kickboxing.  Good luck, and if you do sign up on duolingo you can pm me your name and we can try to beat each others daily exp scores."

My immediate thought is maybe start doing whatever is calling out to you the most and if it's compatible with the other things in your life right now. And the more you think about any one thing, I've found, the faster the answers start coming. Of all these on your list, I think the most compatible would be mindfulness, which ties in with love, focus and attention. It seems all things in life are better savored and benefited by just being more present. Anyway, it's powerful writing out a list like yours, and I wish you luck!"

That'll get you a bunch of Baroque music playing with some other similar classical mixed in, for example. This will gradually increase your repertoire. I've created playlists for some of the greats, such as Bach, Beethoven, and Tchaikovsky, etc. and it has worked pretty well."
DecidingToBeBetter,31r13g,keenman,2,Wed Apr 8 05:24:25 2015 UTC,"So this is music that I like personally. It's on the more ominous side of the classical music spectrum. A good amount of them contain a contribution from the brass section (being my preference).   -Dvorak's Symphony no.9 New World -Beethoven's          Symphony no. 7 second movement...         Symphony no. 9 second movement...         Fur Elise...         Moonlight Sonata -Mozart's Requiem: Lacimosa or Dies Irae -Holst's Planets: Mars an Jupiter -Copland's Fanfare for the common man -Mouret's Rondeau -Bach's           Cello Suite No. 1...          Toccata and Fugue in D Minor  -Barber's Adagio for Strings -Elgar's Enigma Variations   I hope you're able to download these 14 wonderful pieces and have them on your playlist. It is easily hours worth of music and will, hopefully, be easy for you to enjoy and gain an appreciation for how beautiful they really are."

DecidingToBeBetter,31r13g,Suited-Teacup,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:13:09 2015 UTC,"I'm big into diet and nutrition.  I say just buy real food and cook some simple recipes.  Try to avoid the aisles in the grocery stores and shop in the meat and produce sections. Here's an example of a quick, easy meal I make multiple times a week :  Put pan on medium heat with coconut oil.  While it's heating, chop up onion.  Toss in pan.  Add your favorite spices (I usually just toss in a bunch of Indian spices - curry powder, a little cardamom, a little cumin, some chili powder, a LOT of turmeric, and some coriander.  I usually cook the onions until they are caramelized.  Chop up two medium sweet potatoes, add to pan.  Cover and cook until they soften up, about 10-15 minutes max.  Add in 1-1.5 pounds ground beef, add all your spices again.  Cook until ground beef is done.  Serve with salsa (or chop up real tomatoes) and/or avocados.  You can add any veggies to this.  I sometimes do brussel sprouts instead.  You can get a couple big meals out of this for ~$15 total.  Anyway, I don't know if you already cook, but that's the biggest part of diet.  Don't be fooled by those frozen meals that advertise low calories.  They're filled with preservatives and they're aren't really filling.  Buy $20 worth of salmon, throw some dill and lemon juice on it, and bake.  You can get 3 or 4 good portions from that.  Or just grab any fish and do the same.  The main arguments I hear from people who eat out a lot is time and money.  With a little planning, you can cook and eat healthy for nearly the same as you would anywhere else.  And honestly by the time you go to whatever restaurant, order, eat, and get home, you could've just cooked your own food.  And I don't know if you exercise, but for full health optimization, a solid 3-5 sessions of exercise per week is much, much better than just diet alone.  It's the same in reverse, too.  Exercise alone isn't nearly as good as diet and exercise.  They're like peanut butter and jelly.  But let's go with almond butter and fresh preserves.  EDIT - and good luck with your list.  If you ever wanna talk nutrition, hit me up.  I can talk about it all day."

Exercise  Become more observant  Focus and concentration  Push myself out of the comfort zone  Self awareness with mindfulness and meditating  Become more calm under pressure   Especially that last one. It's called a ""relaxed-ready"" state, where you aren't tensed up, but also not relaxed to the point of being slow to react to external stimulus.  Basically, if you want to get any decent progress in martial arts, you'll find that you have to do the other stuff on your list, so it's kind of like piggybacking your willpower in order to get more shit done."

What I would recommend is: re-analyze your list, and pick the easiest targets.  The lowest hanging fruit.  By that I mean the items that would cause the most amount of change with the least amount of work.    Start with your diet - easy.  Easier than suddenly adding 1.5 hours/day of exercise to your routine or a few hours/week of Spanish.  You already eat, so just start eating better (there's plenty of research on the internet/reddit).  Add cold showers/meditation to your morning routine -- you already have  amorning routine, it just might suck :P  As for the items that are pure additions: like I said above, pick a couple of the best and target them.  There is near 0 change that you're going to turn in to superman and learn to juggle while learning French and changing your diet and pumping iron to become like Arnold while also becoming a charismatic public speaker and also learning to make an oak table with one hand behind your back.

Complacency and apathy are symptomatic of a bigger problem and are not solely caused by where you are. Even if someone does decide ""Right, well, it's time for me to stop being lazy and move out!"" and does that, if they have an underlying problem that they didn't address, they're going to slip right back into where they were at some point or another. It's better to not have bandaid solutions, and to actually work yourself up to a point where you CAN leave. Maybe they aren't there yet. You don't know any of that.

DecidingToBeBetter,31pjnb,JohnnyIvory,3,Tue Apr 7 03:39:34 2015 UTC,I've not run or exercised at all while losing weight with a very sedentary lifestyle. I've lost about 16 pounds in two months.   Just start by eating less and counting calories on My Fitness Pal.
DecidingToBeBetter,31pjnb,eninc,2,Tue Apr 7 18:07:25 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I did. I'm fairly active, but started losing weight once I stopped consuming 4,000+ calories a day in food and drinks and started counting everything. Word of advice for My Fitness Pal users: Stick to the suggested calorie count, do not off-set the calories you burn off exercising by eating more. Just count the exercise as a bonus. I've lost 13 pounds in less than a month. It works."
DecidingToBeBetter,31pjnb,faceback,2,Tue Apr 7 20:50:56 2015 UTC,"When it comes to losing weight, the consensus is that 80% of weight loss is the result of diet, while only 20% is working out.  Exercise is important to keep your body functioning and looking good, but if you're worried about weight you should be primarily concerned about your diet.  I'd suggest looking into nutrition, doing some looking into the nutritional content of what you're eating, and find where you're lacking. Make small changes. For everything you cut out, add something to your diet as well. Take a couple weeks with each small change - this gradual change is the best way to see success.  My first changes were cutting way back on sugar, and eating more vegetables.  Get moving in a way you can enjoy. Go walking with some music on maybe, or go for a walk down a quiet trail with some vocal birds. Maybe you'd prefer biking? It doesn't matter, it doesn't have to be cardio, it just has to be something you want to incorporate into your lifestyle. The more of a chore it is, the less likely you'll stick to it.  Good luck. I'd suggest maybe visiting /r/loseit for advise or a bit of motivation."
DecidingToBeBetter,31pjnb,Rakaith,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:45:01 2015 UTC,"I found that it was a huge help to listen to some of my favorite music while working out. Also, I really hated running when I started to work out too. Nothing felt better though than weightlifting. Yeah, you're not gonna burn so much fat, but the rewards are so much more obvious that I think it could be easier to stick with. Try it out.   There may be other issues at hand here though. People who are depressed often have difficulty motivating themselves. I am not a doctor, but I think that your self-hatred is defeating your desire to improve yourself.   My honest suggestion is to start with some therapy. Some scoff at therapy and think it's a load of bullshit, but it's so much more than what it is portrayed to be. These therapy programs are statistically proven methods of retraining your brain.  I wish you the best."
DecidingToBeBetter,31pjnb,bignosebigmoney,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:31:48 2015 UTC,"Here's what I think. There is no better time to start getting into shape than right now. There will never be some magical morning where you wake up and the Rocky theme song starts playing in your head, and you say to yourself ""Today is a wonderful day to start running!"" Therefore, if you're not going to start today, then when are you going to start?!  Starting out in fitness is intimidating. The scrawny dudes feel awfully stupid trying to bench press 45lbs while somebody else next to them puts up 225 like it's a joke. The overweight feel stupid huffing and puffing down the sidewalk while beautiful thin ponytail babes pass them by without breaking a sweat. But remember that 99% of people will be happy and excited for you, because you've decided to better yourself.   Most importantly, it can take weeks to realize that you are actually getting better at running! Check out /r/C25K, it is a running program designed to get people off the couch. It was the first fitness program I ever completed in my life, and I'd recommend it to anyone.  Fitness is all about seeing positive feedback. When you break your records in running, when you lift more weight than ever before, THOSE are the times when you are most motivated to run, lift, whatever. That is what makes C25K so great. You will have a concrete record to break every time you go out to run. Seeing yourself make progress is what makes running not suck, and eventually become enjoyable.  Good luck!"
DecidingToBeBetter,31pjnb,awco,1 point,Tue Apr 7 06:03:54 2015 UTC,"Everyone is going to be a little bit different about what they find motivating. A couple things I've found helpful:   Committing to doing something small each day, and tracking it daily with a tool like https://chains.cc/ or even just on paper. See /r/theXeffect. The idea is that you want to build up a daily habit, and get to the point where you don't want to break your chain of progress. Not only that, commit to doing something super, stupidly easy, and work up from there. Commit to something like doing one push up, or one jumping jack, or running in place for one minute. Sometimes the hard thing about working to change yourself isn't the actual thing you need to do, but getting the inertia to actually follow through. More often than not, what I've found is that I do that one minor thing, think ""oh, that wasn't so bad"", and it's actually motivating to do a couple more. Third, whatever it is, do it now. If you want to make a change, start it immediately, within the next five minutes. Don't wait for your brain and your laziness to catch up. Also, do some thinking about your attitude towards improvement, and perhaps your motivation for doing whatever you want to do. Write them down. Having some actual concrete goals, and working on them consistently, will help keep you moving forward."

And I have trouble getting motivated to ""work out"".  The task seems daunting somehow.  But do I know that will make me better?  Yes, so I break it down.  Am I willing to put on my running outfit?  Yeah, I can do that.  Do I feel like running now?  If not, can I go outside or drive to where I plan to run?  Yeah, that's doable.  Do I want to run now?  If not, I'll walk the first half mile - and that's no big deal, I can do that - well, now I'm out here, I'm dressed for it...fuck it, I may as well go for a run =)  And THEN, I feel good and it's easier the next time.  If I have another day where it's not easy, I just repeat the step by step process and take myself through it that way.

DecidingToBeBetter,31poyk,ShitAtCode,5,Tue Apr 7 04:27:54 2015 UTC,"Dude, life is a huge struggle. You're not a piece of shit. There are so many difficult things about being human.   If you can't afford therapy, there are free options. You might not be too keen on the idea of therapy, but I assure you that these are statistically proven methods of retraining your brain.  Some people weren't meant for the society we have built. Some people aren't good at the things society values. It doesn't matter. The important thing is that these people learn to accept and love themselves. Progress and happiness comes as a byproduct. Therapy will guide you through this process.  If you don't want to do therapy, the inspiration has to come from within. You have to challenge negative thoughts and ideas about yourself. Your mind is biased towards the negative at the moment. You need to teach it that negativity is not always the proper response to any perceived faults you may have.  When you're feeling confident, everything else comes easily. School? Won't seem like such an insurmountable struggle. Relationship issues? You will have the level-headedness to approach tense situations reasonably. Drugs? Won't even seem appealing. You won't want to ruin your life.  Don't hate yourself because of how society might view you. Be on your side, do what you like, and stop fearing your own future. It's so much easier said than done, but put your mind to it."

The thing with TV is that you end up watching it even if you don't want to. It's sort of like having narcolepsy. You're cleaning your house. You're doing good, making good time. Getting shit done. You walk past the TV and a commercial catches your eye, and then Judge Judy's back on and then you're sitting there for the next 15 minutes trying to find out if Judy's going to let Trevor get away with doing this crap to Shantessa or not.  Why was the TV even on? You weren't watching it. It costs money to run it. It's noisy. It pollutes the air and has that weird ""screen on"" whine coming from it 100% of the time it's in use, even if it's muted, and now, on top of all of that, it's keeping your dishes dirty, too. And why? So people can sell you Charmin Ultra. Fuck that noise."

If I go someplace that has normal television on (cigar lounge or something) the commercials drive me out of my MIND now.

DecidingToBeBetter,31m65z,forgiveangel,2,Mon Apr 6 16:50:23 2015 UTC,People always ask me why I am such a positive person and I am sure at least 50% of that is because I never watch the news and barely read it either.

Idk if it's the same as yours, but it was basically ""therapist-in-training"" and they helped me quite a bit. If I had any questions they didn't have answers to, it would always have been answered in the next session due to the therapist asking their ""supervisor"" who was a licensed psychiatrist.   I made sure to not use my university, since mine was basically known for business & I sought a university that was well known for sciences."

From what you describe it sounds like your assessment that ""following their dreams for me instead of my own is what is pushing me into this hole. I feel like I'm just working myself toward another crash"" is spot on.  The dynamic that lead to the situation is likely where your key to healing lies, and is probably symbolized best by the statement, ""I always found it best to keep my mouth shut, as doing so often avoided severe conflicts.""  You're avoiding conflict by continuing to silently suffer through living someone else's goals for you, and it's making you miserable.  Whether you stick with the opportunity you have or choose to start a new path, learning to love and accept and honor yourself is where you'll find lasting happiness."

I often compare who I am now to who I have the potential to be. That's kind of how I set my goals. Unfortunately, in doing this, I often find myself thinking about my characteristics/traits and how different, how much happier, how much better of a human I would be at this stage in my life if I maybe stood up for myself a little more earlier on. If I focused on just doing me, so to speak.  I try not to dwell on the past. After all, it's all long gone and all that matters is what you do today to determine how your tomorrow goes. But that mindset is something I struggle with, because everything that I am - everything I read, see, hear - are all interpreted by a mind fueled by a cumulation of past experiences I have witnessed, that lead me to see the world in the way I see it now.  I am attempting to love/accept/honor myself more and more. Reading a lot of self-help books have taught me that happiness begins from within, so every day I try and put myself in the best possible situation.

While happiness does come from the inside, you're never going to manufacture it with sheer will. You find it when you live true to your ideals and purpose.  For me, I had to physically distance myself from the world I grew up in, because I recognized that it crippled me. I had a kind of hypersensitivity to how my actions would impact everyone around me and killed myself trying to everything that I thought would make them happy, content, proud, etc.  In reality, most of the gravity of those feelings was my own extrapolation of a few past experiences/ situations/ comments. Everyone was much happier to see me figure out what mattered to me and stop worrying about what I thought I needed to do for everyone else.  At that point, my life did a complete 180. I knew what I wanted. I knew what I needed to do to get there. I did that. I go back home for visits, but I still prefer to live over a thousand miles away.  It doesn't mean I love any of my friends or family any less. I just know where I work. I could probably go back now and be fine, but I love the outdoors too much to give up easy access to mountains and rivers."

How long did it take you to come to the decision to make that change? I'm hoping that will be something I'll get to experience soon, but the question really is just how long until I can make it happen? My head says I'll need to wait until I graduate as having a degree will open up my options.   I love my family/friends also, but yes, being apart from them definitely works. A ten minute phone call from them can restart the panic I've worked all day to settle.  Having easy access to mountains and rivers is a blessing. In a way, I'm glad I became sad, because otherwise I don't think I would ever have held the same appreciation for nature as I do now. We recently moved again, so home outside of uni for me now is in the most beautiful place, with gorgeous scenery right in my backyard. I am so lucky. Being inside the home is a curse, but stepping outside and being able to go for a 5 mile hike up a mountain is absolutely glorious!!"

We taped half-sheets of paper up in columns (categories) with goals on them. Once we accomplished the goal, we removed the sheet of paper. You could do something similar with pushpins instead of tape. Pop your goals for the day or week or month up there and flip them over when you accomplish it. Flip them back before bed if you need to accomplish that same goal the next day.  Visually seeing my goals every day helped tremendously.  Ultimately, though, you're just going to have to do it.

DecidingToBeBetter,31i588,LJI0711,5,Sun Apr 5 09:49:55 2015 UTC,That's what I'm not too sure about.
DecidingToBeBetter,31i588,uch,27,Sun Apr 5 09:50:32 2015 UTC,"I read once that the figuring out what you want is the most  important thing you can do.  I'm still working on it,  but the method I'm using looks like this: 1. Break it down into 5 categories: Professional,  Financial, Personal, Fitness and  Self-fulfillment.  Professional is pretty obvious. Financial is somewhat obvious as well,  but more broad; eliminate debt, build an emergency fund, safe for a house/retirement, etc. Personal is a little tougher,  but I'm thinking about things like maintaining healthy relationships (SO, family, friends) by being disciplined, honest, ethical. Fitness is pretty obvious as well, but often overlooked. Self-fulfilment is what you make of it; what you want to do/learn/see/experience/be known for in this life. Want to learn to play piano? backpack across Europe? repair old motorcycles /cars /stereos? Think find and enjoyment and time well spent,  not profit in this category.  2. Now pick one category and brainstorm things you want in that area.  (Google ""brainstorm methods"" if you've never done it before).  There are no bad ideas at this point, so write everything down, but try to stay focused on only one area at a time. Once you've listed all the things you want in one area, move onto the next.  If your unsure if something goes on one category or another,  list it in both.  Take your time and don't be afraid to go jump around; sometimes an idea in one category will remind you of something similar in another.  Brainstorming is non-linear.  Just go with it.  3. Now the hard part.  Separate the wheat from the chaff.  Take the list you made for one category, consider each item carefully and decide whether that item is important enough for you to make sacrifices to attain it.  Take the list for that category and distill it down one or two items that resonate with your very being. Do this for each category. You now know what you want,  which puts you ahead of 99% of the population in the game of life. Note how the items you choose from each category line up,  how they seem to complement each other. Take pride and celebrate getting here. If you do nothing else beyond this,  you have a framework in place year few others do,  and every decision you make can be considered against that framework. When a decision must be made,  you can ask yourself, ""Does this support my long term goals or not?"" When you plan your day,  you can compare that days plan against your wants and know instantly if your helping our hurting your long term success that day. If you do nothing else,  you've already won,  but don't stop here.   4. Turn these ""wants and ideas"" from each category into into Goals.  (Google SMART Goals) These goals can and should be considered at t+1 year, t+5 years, t+10 years. t=0 is today. You may find that your original lists have some of these different linear sub-goals already. For example,  you may want to own a home, but you have $15,000 in credit card debt,  paying off the debt would be a good start toward owning that home.  5. Now that you know what you want, you can start planning how to get there. Make a plan for each category.  Set sub-goals  for each large goal,  and put a time target on each. Don't get discouraged.  I guarantee you'll miss some goals.  You'll find that you cannot achieve your plans in the time you alloted. That's OK.  You've never done this before and you're learning the whole time.  Don't lose heart.  Don't get discouraged.  Your plans are living things.  They'll have to adapt as your life changes."

Every few months I'd go to Target amd try on smaller jeans. I always took photos of the tag to remind myself that on this day I was a size 18,16,14,12!! Holy fuck, a 12!  And then I fell off. Keto is all about extreme restrictions. Basically, no carbs. No bread, no pasta, no sugar, no rice, no corn, no beans, no ice cream, no milk... That's a big area of NO. Temptation is constant. Everywhere you go there's snickers bars and soda and free bread at every dinner, free mints waiting in lobbies, parties at the office. Even ordering coffee became a hassle.   For a while finding new and clever ways to order out, to bring my coffee cream with me, to shop and to eat was fun. I loved it. I counted my carbs and calories and raked in the compliments from friends and family.   And then one day I had a piece of cake. I was sick as a dog. But it didn't dissuade me next time, or the next. My weight loss became a plateau. The other night I stopped at taco bell after work. I tried to talk myself out of it for miles before I got there. In the drive through line (yes, I waited in line) I called my husband and asked what he wanted to have for dinner when I got home. He didn't have plans and I was too ashamed of my shitty food choice (taco bell of all things!) to tell him plainly that I needed his help. ""Get me out of this drive through,"" is what I should have said.   ""I'll see you in a bit. Almost home.""   Taco bell wasn't even good but I ate it like I hadn't eaten in days. Did it make me happier? No. Did it assuage the sting of fucking up my progress and ruining my diet? No. If anything I felt worse for not being honest with my best friend, for letting myself down, for being weak willed and fat and nasty and....   My point is: you need to forgive yourself for fucking up and treating yourself poorly (by eating to your detriment). Start there.   Second, find a supportive group or person with whom you can be 100% honest. When your naughty self seeks to undermine your good will and your progress, seek out those people/that person. Lean on them, not junk food. If you're working out, I want to say that there are others near you who will be very supportive and kind to your struggle.   Third, continue to forgive yourself for your fuck ups. There will be more, but it's okay.   Lastly, take photos NOW so you have tangible evidence of your progress later. I also took measurements of various points on my body to reference directly later.  .  .  .  .  All this to say, friend, that you will change your behavior when you are truly ready to; when hope to be better outweighs whatever morose comfort you (and I) find in wallowing in junk food."

I fight junk food at the store, not the kitchen. You need to treat bad habits like a drug. Get as far away from the temptation as you can.

I read an article  a while ago that really clicked with me. It turns out that habits are basically unconscious decisions, made without thinking. You might say that ""we can't help"" feeling dem urges. For example, I have a habit of opening certain pages when I'm bored. More than a few times I've closed a page, zoned out for a bit, and then reopened that same page out of habit.  closes reddit  opens reddit  Then I'd stop and realize what I'd done, and feel pretty fucking stupid.  My point is, habits have ""preconditions."" In your case (and many other peoples'), being bored. Maybe another precondition is being at your computer desk. My advice is to think about what ""triggers"" (god I hate that word) you to eat food, or drive all the way to Wendy's to get chicken nuggets (I don't blame you, they're fucking good), and avoid those scenarios. Maybe move your desktop computer somewhere else, reinstall Windows, perhaps install a ""productivity partition"" with another operating system, perhaps make strides to not make your desk your ""default relaxation spot."" For example, I can work efficiently with my laptop on campus, but I am a useless piece of shit when I'm home and using my desktop computer. Try to change your environment and do some new shit.  that being said, it's kind of hard to just ""not be bored.""  I don't have any advice for you there....  Hmmm...  Good luck! :) lol"

If youre gonna eat a small pack of chips a week and that keeps you on eating healthy the rest of the week then go ahead. If you're just gonna completely stop, your brain is going to crave it and you will end up completely breaking your diet. And eat less carbs. Carbs arent especially tasty anyway. I personally eat a square of chocolate every day as a reward for eating less carbs and exercising. I still lost 2kg in a month. Maybe my rate of progress is slower than someone who doesn't eat chocolate sure, but the difference is I'm happy to stay on my diet instead of seeing it as a chore.

There is no magic pill, no quote that will magically make it all better, and you won't suddenly wake up one day as a perfect functional person.  Let me tell you this; it's fucking hard, and you have to work hard to change your perception. You are not succeeding immediately because its a journey, a long one, and you wish so hard to stop feeling the way you do so any time you falter because you are human, you are going to feel like a failure.  You may never be the perfect human, but you can make small steps to change your life. I have fallen into severe depression so many times on this journey and have failed at suicide, but I refuse to give up. Its like trudging through mud, but every year I look back and I have noticed the changes I have made even if they are small. One example is that I used to blame others for my problems, and I never do that anymore.   There is no magic in this, because you have to get down and work at it.

Takes 5 minutes before bed.  Next time you talk to someone, remember a thing from your list:    ""Oh, wow, yesterday I listened to this amazing new song..."" (Thus begins a discussion on music)  ""There is a cool new event happening weekly at..."" (This discussion can run to: the type of event, the place it is run through, or the people organizing)  Or, start learning things about current events:  ""Did you read in the news that...""  It's a skill you have to learn.  A lot, and I mean most, people communicate via complaining. It's just a form of bonding, but I think it does dampen the spirit of things a little.  Once you learn how to communicate positively, you'll have to start learning how to re-direct other people.

Complaining is   neutral, it is the attitude that you put towards it that makes it positive or negative. Don't complain if your not going to do anything about it.  I would suggest reading A Complaint Free World by Will Bowen. In the book he tells us of the negative effects of complaining. Quick fact; the average person complains an average of 40 times a day. That's a lot of negativity for one person. Imagine that in an office, or school, or city.   It will be hard to stop complaining at first. You just have to think about what your going to say before you say it. If you don't have something positive to say, don't say it. It will feel awkward at first, but you don't have to say anything if you don't want.   Bear this in mind though, if you do end up not complaining anymore, your world will change. People you thought were positive people will become negative and it will be harder to talk to them. I know a lot of people that don't like me and just don't talk to me because their only means of communication is through complaining. I don't let them complain and when they do, I offer suggestions to fix the issue. Complainers just don't like it. They want their complaints to be acknowledged.  If you are whole-heartedly into trying to be complaint free, pick up the book i suggested and follow the plan. If you don't want to spend the money, I can just tell you the way he teaches you to become complaint free. It's a real simple concept."
DecidingToBeBetter,31fkq1,Endless_Search,4,Sat Apr 4 19:00:47 2015 UTC,"Negative tone. The peculiar nature of a complaint is that it has a negative tone, and can be read as such, and it doesn't always help the situation along. Whereas a positive tone, or one that encourages conversation, and asserts action is one that seems to be generally appreciated.  It isn't the act of complaining that's negative. That isn't the problem. The nature of conversation is such that when you feel relaxed enough you can, will, or do complain and talk openly when you talk with other people after rapport and comfort has been built. Conversation can go any number of ways, but a good start with some crashing down and complaining makes for what can be constituted as  a normal flow of conversation.  The problem is that if you complain all the time the image you give off is someone that looks for things to complain about, be negative over, or talk about without asserting action. The other side is that it also takes you down in the process.    The one solid piece of advice to give you is: watch yourself. See if the tone you are giving yourself sounds like complaining to you and if it actually providing a benefit to the situation or the circumstance.   Anyone can complain in much the same way that anyone can be an armchair philosopher, or a reddit lurker. The reality is that if you don't contribute somehow either to yourself or someone else. Then you have no reason to complain because the only individual you are putting down is yourself. (In part because even when you talk to other people, you also talk to yourself too as you hear the sound of your own voice.)  So give yourself some respect, catch yourself, and if the statement you provide does not help the situation or produce and outcome. Then don't say that statement.   P.S. At most the advice I'm giving will give you a solid reason to recognize why the complaint isn't the most important statement to make when talking with other people. However the decision and the interpretation will have to be your own."

""This sucks, and I am now taking steps to fix it"" is a positive statement. But if you just say ""This sucks, and now I'm going to wallow in it"" then you're negative.  So don't complain unless you have actions to back it up. If you don't, which you usually won't, (which is fine) then either say nothing, or change your words to ""It could have been worse if..."" or ""Thank goodness it wasn't..."""
DecidingToBeBetter,31fkq1,CaptHayes,5,Sat Apr 4 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"Complaining is an extension of feeling helpless. You subconsciously hope that the person you complain to will help you. I've found several things that help with that, but two of the best ones are these:   Exercise. It boosts the chemicals in your body that make you feel confident and in control. Plus, actually sticking to a routine is evidence that you have some control of your life.  Before you say something negative think, ""Is this person able to help resolve my issue?"" If they can't, drop it. If they can, ask yourself a second question: ""Can they help me in a way that I could not possibly achieve without them?"" If the answer to both of those questions is 'yes', instead of complaining, openly ask them for help."

Example, ""the weather yesterday was just dreadful, but, I'm looking forward to the nice weekend."" Or, ""I didn't sleep a wink last night, however, I'm hoping that I will make up for it tonight.""    I personally believe that positive behavior is addictive and begins with hopeful thoughts. When you carry hope of things that make you happy and you let those things influence you, it helps turn negative thoughts and habits into motivation for being better."
DecidingToBeBetter,31fkq1,letswrestle,2,Sat Apr 4 22:21:58 2015 UTC,"I used to be the same way. I got myself into a lot of drama because my negative statements were often about other people. I understand what you mean when you say that you don't feel negative, that it's just a verbal crutch. However, it seems like you already realize the energy this gives off to others.  Luckily, we learned this speech pattern as kids and we can learn a new pattern as adults!  What has worked for me over the years is to go opposite. Instead of complaining about things to make conversation, I flip it around to hopeful or positive statements.   On a snowy cold day you might say ""I can't believe we're only two weeks from spring, yay!""    In the kitchen at work, talk about how delicious/healthy/interesting your/their food is.  No idea what to say? Start with a complement and follow up with a question. ""I saw that report you did for the team, I was impressed. What made you think of that?""  Always have a favorite tv show to discuss.   Mentally note the funny/positive things you see in life. They'll be easier to reach for in a moment of awkwardness if you're already thinking about them.  When in doubt, shift the focus to the other person. Ask questions and get to know them. When they complain (they will), don't commiserate. Just laugh/smile and find the silver lining.  Finally, find a positive friend! Watch how they interact with people and snag a few of their go-tos."
DecidingToBeBetter,31fkq1,JDNow,2,Sun Apr 5 01:49:38 2015 UTC,"I used to communicate through complaints, too. It was a way of expressing dissatisfaction with the world, which is appropriate if you are trying to change it but not if all you're going to do is complain. As the saying goes ""criticism is welcome, but it must be constructive."" Otherwise, it bleeds the positive energy from those around you.  /u/EBWasLeftOut and /u/Aw3some-O are on the right track about the spin at the end, while /u/wirhaben has a fantastic way of changing your mindset of how to express yourself. And, after all, isn't that what you're after? If you have a positive outlook and describe yourself as an optimist, but express your views negatively through complaining, you are communicating only the negative and come across as a pessimist. How can anyone know you otherwise? Your words are the vector by which you transmit your thoughts to other people; to expect someone to look at the entirety of your behavior otherwise is an expectation of superhumanity on the observer's part without even going into why someone would go to all that effort. Your words must carry the truth of who you are, else they are lies.  Going further, your words also affect your mindset through your own internal dialog. If you repeat constant negativity, you will become a negative person. I'm sure that a cursory search of this subreddit will find enough examples of why negative self-talk is a bad thing that I should not have to go into further detail. If you are going to be a happier person, express yourself as happier and your mindset will follow.  TL;DR: Don't worry, be happy."

It also brings to the table a few techniques that give you a quantum leap into being more present which is something that is lacking these days.  The 7 habits of highly effective people is pretty good. I have spent a year on the first chapter and another year on the second chapter. It's about shifting your perspective and become principle centered. It pushes off feelings and gives space for values that mean something to you. You get a sense of direction and purpose in life.  Finally I enjoyed Demian, it's an existential book on duality and is more of a story. The internal struggle described and some of it is pretty poignant, it kind of gives you an idea that life isn't easy, that's okay.

DecidingToBeBetter,31ef8a,fuckuppunk,12,Sat Apr 4 07:23:13 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you a story.    In 2012 I went to university with the expectation of studying IT. The first couple of months went well, then I just... stopped. I gave up, failed, and dropped out. So I went back home. I had no job, next to no money, and I had to live with the shame of failing a course because I couldn't be bothered.  I spent a couple of weeks like you are now: feeling sorry for myself and wondering if I could ever do anything with my life. But, luckily, my (then soon-to-be) stepdad had just moved in and we had a conversation about where I was and what I was going to do about it. I decided to claim Job Seeker's Allowance until I found some work and while I waited for my application to be approved, I went to Scarborough to help my Nanna pack up her stuff to move house.   It felt good to be doing something again, so when I got back and had my initial interview with the Job Centre, I then set about redecorating the house with my stepdad when I want applying for jobs or attending weekly meetings at the Job Centre. On top of this, I happened to have my weekly meetings on a Thursday, the same day that my mate would meet some others for pool, so I went along to that as well. It really helped.   I eventually found a job as a Housekeeper for a large hotel chain, which I kept for 18 months. This job allowed my apply to uni again (this time studying education, which in thoroughly enjoying).    My point here is that no matter how screwed you think you are, there's still a chance to fix it. I'm glad that suicide is not an option for you and that you recognise your worth.   I can't give you first hand advice, but I can point you in the direction of some reading material. First, for general background stuff I have The Art of Manliness' 30 Days to a Better Man series. It gives you a small team to do each day that (of you do it properly) well make you a better person. I've linked the first task: defining your core values. Their case study into the life of Winston Churchill also has a lot of useful information on manhood. They also have a sporadic series called Lessons in Manliness, where they take a good person, or someone who lived the Art of Manliness and explains why. Here's the article on Atticus Finch.    I simply don't like most people... [a]ll of this hatred is 100% superficial    I think that if you look to simply ""be kind"", type not going to get anywhere. Instead, practice being warm to others, look to offer compliments, and give real smiles. After all, you need to act at something before you can think it and be it, not the other way round.  I hope you read this, I really do. DFTBA."

I have had some similar feelings, especially about getting fit and the money aspect.  Everyone's motivation for getting up and doing things is different. I personally like having tangible external goals. I discovered that having workout stuff at home doesn't work for me. I need to go someplace with other people to workout. I joined a gym and I go to 2 classes every week. People know me there now too and it's not just about going to the gym, its about being social too.  Sometimes it's also just about making yourself do it even if you don't want to. When I feel like crap and I don't want to go out, I find that when I make myself go out I feel so much better.   As for the financial stuff, check with your local public library and see if they have a financial planning program. You would get to meet with a  financial planner free of charge and get some of your questions answered. You should also see if anyone in /r/personalfinance can give you so money tips.

You have problems going back years--give yourself years to fix them.   Learn to fucking meditate. You're getting all crazy because you're bouncing between which thing you're fucking trying to solve. You don't have to be solving your problems all the time. Just learn to sit. Then start an exercise routine. Join a jogging group or basketball league or whatever. Get your heart rate up every day. Try a 7 minute workout.  Then diet. That comes a lot easier once you're exercising. Just start every freaking meal with vegetables and protein. No simple refined carbs. You can watch your brain start screaming for suuuuuuuggggggaaar. That's an addition right there. Kill it.  Your blood sugar is shit, which compounds the temperament stuff--the depression & enervation. Hopefully, once you get past your sugar withdrawal, you'll even out. Finances. Set up automatic payments for your bills. Write a budget. Stick to your budget.  Find someone to talk to about this all. It can't be just your fiancee; she's not your therapist.

DecidingToBeBetter,31ef8a,androidangel,2,Sat Apr 4 10:58:36 2015 UTC,"Hi!  First, you're not ""below our pay grade"".  This sub is for anybody who wants to be better.  You want to be better.  Therefore, you qualify.  Second off, I don't know you terribly well so maybe I'm not the best judge, but you don't really seem to be exceptionally bad at life.  You have some serious problems that are causing you a lot of stress and making you unhappy, absolutely, but there's a difference between that and ""fail at life"".  Let's do a breakdown of the problems you're having.  One. Poor financial management.  You spend more than you need to, you don't pay your bills on time, and you have bad credit.  The answer to that is just to make a budget.  Then, anytime you make a purchase, make sure you're budgeted for it.  Just being aware of what you're doing as you're doing it works wonders.  If you're going to eat a big plate of french fries, or buy some useless consumer crap, or ridicule somebody on the net, just stop and ask yourself: Is doing this going to be of benefit to me?  Is it going to help make me the person I want to be?  And if you can honestly answer ""yes"" to that question, then go ahead and do it.  Two. You're fat. This is honestly not even remotely uncommon in America.  People are always trying to get you to eat crap.  As a vegan you're more aware of that than most people, but that doesn't make you immune to the problem.  You're going to be strongly tempted, particularly when you're stressed, when your mind is otherwise occupied.  And the answer to this is pretty much the same as the answer to problem #1: Being intentional, planning things out ahead of time.  It's a pain in the ass to plan your life out, but if you make decisions about what to eat and what to buy on the spur of the moment, they're more likely to be bad decisions, because there's a lot of social impetus and psychological persuasion going into trying to get people to make bad decisions.  This means that you should plan your meals in advance.  Tell yourself when you are going to eat and what you are going to eat, so you don't have to think about it, because if you start thinking about it, the first thing you will be thinking is ""Oh my God, sofritas are SO GOOD.""  So don't even go there.  Make a big pot of beans and rice on your off-time.  If you flavor it up right, it will be just as delicious as sofritas.  Then when it is time for lunch, just microwave your beans and rice, and you will be eating better and eating delicious.  Three. You want to go to therapy but are afraid you can't afford it.  OK, here's where I get to give some different advice.  Acquire knowledge.  Find out what your options are.  My experience has been that there are a lot of resources available for people seeking mental health.  Do some research, make some calls.  Don't just assume that nobody will be able to help you.  Same goes for medications.  Most mental health drugs are out of patent and are available as generics.  You might find that they're more affordable than you assumed.  Or maybe not.  I can't make any guarantees.  All I'm saying is that you should know whether you can make therapy and medication work for you, and if you can't do it right now, you should figure out what you need to do to get to the point where it will work for you.  Even if you can't afford medication and you can just afford therapy, well, I think it's worth pursuing.  I've certainly had times in my life where I was only doing therapy and wasn't on any medication, and overall it worked out pretty well for me.  There's the three major problems you've identified.  Reading your post I see signs of a fourth: Low self-esteem.  When I read your post, I see someone who's judging themselves very harshly for having problems, in a way that's pretty out of proportion to the problems themselves.  Human beings live according to narratives.  If the story you've built for your life is that you're a horrible fuck-up and failure, you're going to live in ways that confirm that story.  When you make statements about yourself and about your life, try to make them specific and meaningful.  Statements like ""My life is a goddamn mess"" and ""I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing"" simply aren't supported by the concrete evidence you've provided in your post.  When you find yourself saying things like that about yourself, I recommend comparing them against specific facts in your life and revising them until they are supported by the evidence.  My experience has been that doing that in and of itself will point you in directions that lead you closer to solving your problems."
DecidingToBeBetter,31ef8a,pfannkuchen_ii,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:23:05 2015 UTC,"Vegan on the roll is sometimes difficult. I recommend lots of raw foods that you can buy in the supermarket that provide you with everything you need: fruits, veggies and nuts while you're driving. Plus there is always hummus and something to eat it with - whole wheat bread, carrots etc. As for regular meals, go to a normal place, you can always get a vegan option that is not shitty. Beans and rice or similar things. You don't need a ""complete"" meal if you eat fruits, veggies, seeds and nuts all the time. And you'll start losing weight if you avoid all the crappy food. And feel better.  Exercise is also important. Running for example has been shown to be more effective than antidepressants in treating depression. Try programs like ""couch to 5k"" to start building a habit. The right attitude is key: I ""lied"" myself into liking running in the beginning, and two years later I cannot imagine a life without running, it's very addictive. It really helps me to relieve stress and reflect on my life/actions.  Do you know the reason why you are so judgmental? That might be worth reflecting on. I think at this stage medication is not necessary, but seek out a specialist."

It sounds kinda dumb, but the way I got more exercise and changed up my hermitage lifestyle was setting little goals. Like instead of driving to the nearest gas station for that late night soda or whatever, I would walk. Sometimes it's that simple. Plus, you would probably benefit from a regiment of loving yourself. Now before you go ""there is no way I could ever love myself"", take a second and look at the changes you've already accomplished. You realize that your life is important and worth living, take that and run with it.

But I do know how it feels to feel like everything has spiralled and there is no way back.  Do you make lists? I find lists are the easiest way for me to break things down and fend off the feeling that I'm on one side of an insurmountable mountain. Write out everything that is making you like this, and underneath each heading, dot point ways that it can be fixed (not just ways you can fix it, but get outside yourself for a minute and write down every possible solution to each problem). Everything can be fixed.   Don't try and fix everything all at once, taking on too much is a sure fire way to fail. Make little changes. Take healthy snacks with you to work instead of grabbing stuff on the road. Salads, fruit, healthy crackers etc. You say you can afford therapy but not the medication. Can you find someone that can act as a life coach as well as a therapist? It's better than nothing, and talking things out can often make it easier to deal with.   Good luck, OP. I believe in you, go change your life!"

Learn how to deal with critique - ask for critique instead of avoiding it or defending yourself. Dont judge other people as you are reflecting to yourself. The more you are invested in things you want to hide or are important for you the more you want them to defend. Read When I Say No I Feel Guilty and The Power Of Now.

Most of your problems are solvable with a change in attitude. Most of the others will resolve themselves once your mental and physical habits have changed. If you get anything from writing this post, know that your acknowledgment and identification of your perceived problems is the first step in deciding how you want to change yourself.   I'd start by defining your values in life so you can commit to the things you know you believe in. That sounds like something your fifth grade teacher (or UK equivalent) might say, but try to figure it out. With commitment will come respect for yourself. With respect you'll begin to define your standards in life. Commit to those and you'll build self esteem and healthier habits."

The good news is that you're already here asking questions, so you're doing well already.   The thing to do it invest in some self improvement. It's what I did when I was in a similar position. I recommend The Art of Manliness (A self improvement site dedicated to helping adult males become men as defined throughout history, not the caricatured version that's portrayed in film and men's magazines). I'd start here with their 30 Days to a Better Man series and the life skills series. There's also a Churchill School of Adulthood series.   You're more than capable of changing yourself. I did it to.

DecidingToBeBetter,317skb,MenaFinds,23,Thu Apr 2 18:05:03 2015 UTC,"My $.02:  The short answer? You can't explain it. I feel I'm pretty good with words, but I've never been able to put the black, unrelenting, sluggish agony into words. I just tried it there, but it doesn't feel like I hit the mark. I haven't actively looked for it, but perhaps a writer or poet has been able to touch on it. But the more I think about it, the more it feels like something you can only truly and fully grasp by suffering from it yourself.   People can witness it, though. Sometimes that helps them to comprehend. A good friend's girlfriend fell into a depression because her birth control messed her hormones up something fierce. After he told me that, he said to me ""You should be glad you're sitting here now, having a beer with me."" It felt good to get that recognition from him, for having wrestled that 'black dog' to the ground. I'd told him about my depression before, but I'd never gotten this response from him. He had to see it first-hand to really get it.  Others just don't understand. They want to, but they just don't. I think we'll always have people like that around us for the foreseeable future. Some even simply don't believe it's a real thing, or that it's as debilitating as it is. I'll say things like ""it's a sort of special hell in your mind, tailored specifically for you,"" or ""I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, I kid you not."" People give you a nod and and 'uh-huh', but they don't get it. They just don't know. How could they?  It's too alien a concept. You're unable to feel joy. Hell, you're unable to feel a lot of things, save for guilt. Maybe I wouldn't have been able to grasp that myself before it snuck up on me. Moreover, my therapist didn't know what it was like. He simply hadn't ever suffered from it, and thus just didn't know and didn't pretend to know. I found it highly strange that the man helping me with every step of my recovery didn't have this fully complete knowledge of what we were fighting. At the same time, I applauded his honesty.  I've beaten my depression, for so far as you can say that. It's always there though, even if it's the tiniest speck on the horizon. Both two years ago, when I was in the thick of it, and today, I have always been very candid about it. If it's relevant, I'll probably bring it up. I won't hide the fact any more than I would another, less stigmatized disease. If that makes people uncomfortable, then that's their problem, not mine. I've got enough on my plate without having to hide it for fear of being misunderstood.  The funny thing is it says a bit about people. How they react when you tell them straight up. You can tell if they know what it is, or they can imagine, or they believe you, or they think you're weak and crazy.  Again, ultimately, I don't let a lack of understanding from others become my problem. I will tell them whatever they want to hear and show them whatever they want to see, but their understanding is not my problem. Depression, however, is, and that's more than enough for me.  I hope this shines a light on something or other. Your first video was very touching to watch, and I thank you for it."

That means they've never had to suffer from it or had anybody close to them suffer from it. They may be jerks and make dismissive comments, but I would rather have someone do that than have them have first hand experience with it.   I totally relate to your feelings of your therapist not really understanding it.

But you obviously can't, you have work today. So you get up and go to work and are assigned a hopelessly large amount of work to do. You want to complain, but you notice all the other people around you are somehow managing it. It doesn't seem possible, but you decide you at least have to try.  Its hard to focus because of your lack of sleep and it takes every ounce of your willpower just to go about your work at a snails pace.  But what other choice do you have? So the day drags on. You eat by yourself and you don't talk to anybody because you think it would be more work than its wort'h. You're exhausted, what could you contribute to the conversation anyways?  So work is over, but you can't go home yet. You have to go wait in line at a supermarket to get some food for dinner. Run to the bank to cash a check. Small things. Nothing hard, but in your current state it all is miserable and takes forever.  Finally, you make it back to your house. You make some ramen or something easy because everything else would be too much work. Maybe a friend calls and asks if you want to go get drinks, but even the idea is tiring and you just want to be able to go to bed. Maybe you play some games or watch some tv, but its hard to really enjoy it much. So you decide to just go to bed. Its warm and comfortable and feels so much better than the rest of your day. You quickly fall into a dreamless sleep.  Then you wake up, and do it again. day after day, month after month, year after year. That if anything was a pretty good day. You didn't feel the strong desire to jump off a bridge or run a razor blade across your arm. The sky was sunny unlike the cold rainy days to follow.   Like many other people said, its not really something that can be put into words. The lack of motivation, the exhaustion, the hopelessness is like nothing else in the world.

It makes you see everything good as temporary and everything bad as the mean that life regresses to. It is the specter of doom in your waking existence and it follows you around and prevents you from seeing the good in life. It's like wearing sunglasses so long you forget the world isn't actually that color. It's the fixed perspective which gives you the excuse to stop trying and failing. It keeps you alienated and alone because all you see is walls people put up and their indifference to you. It is filling the unknown with the boogeyman and saying not today. It is the force that keeps people from achieving their dreams. It possesses you like an unending sorrow but you don't even feel sad. you feel nothing. life has no color, no sound, no taste.

DecidingToBeBetter,317mmx,arrogantthrowaway1,10,Thu Apr 2 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"gonna say something that may not be popular...  but since you're using a throwaway I think can say this and not feel like I'm taking a jab at another person:   If you're having issues with reading comprehension, then there's not much to be arrogant about.  Thinking that you know everything is a childish trait that will go away as you mature into adulthood.  The good:  You've managed to see this as a hurdle in your personal development and that's great!  Most people don't recognize their own handicaps until much later in life.    The solution:  As a guy with a family and mortgage and all the stuff that reminds me that I'm actually an adult, the most liberating thing in the world is knowing that I don't know much - this acceptance makes me eager to learn and take it all in.   My mother used to say ""The more I know, the more I know I don't know.""  Its certainly true for me.  So pick up a book. Let it fill your head with the cool stuff that's inside it and resign yourself to the fact that if you already knew what was in that book, it'd be your name on the cover.   Also stop reading Art of War.  Leave it to the 200 level classes at the military academies that can actually make sense of that drivel in practical situations  EDIT: lines and squiggles added here and there"
DecidingToBeBetter,317mmx,Nachotime,3,Thu Apr 2 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"Best advice I can think of would be: step outside of your usual circles and give something you really don't know a try.   Go volunteer at a soup kitchen. Help a local refugee community. Go watch documentaries and talks about experiences from entirely different parts of the world. Hell, even just pick up a book written by somebody (preferably living) who is from a completely different walk of life than you.   Philosophy is great and all, but if you're stuck feeling like it's all obvious, then it's context that you're lacking."

Basically you lack an awarness of the knowledge and vision.  I used to be somewhat like this, but once I realize some ideas can have two interpretations / perspective and both have legetimate reason to be right. To really determine (AKA dig deeper), which is right you have to obtain more information, but then this information is in most cases impossible. You will finally realize you really know nothing because you don't have evidence, but only assumptions you made yourselves.  Look into Socrates, his philosphy, and his phrase, ""I know that I know nothing."" Truly try to understand how someone so wise would say it. My first interpretation of the phrase was wrong, but after taking a philosphy class I have a different interpretation, which I believe to be right. Who knows I might have a different one as I learn more about the world and mature."

Imagine if your car needed to be ""warmed up"" for a few hours before you could drive it. I repeat, it's not normal to feel this way and you should definitely seek help. Your troubles getting up in the morning are a likely by-product of what sounds to me like depression or anxiety disorder.  How is your daily routine, diet, excercise etc.? Do you use alcohol or other drugs?"
DecidingToBeBetter,318jut,KristjanHrannar,1 point,Fri Apr 3 07:19:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe I was a bit overzealous in my explanation. Its not that I wake up in the morning like ""fuck someone please shoot me I don't want to do this."" I have nearly perfect attendance in all my classes, I work out 6x/week lifting and cardio, diet has improved somewhat but its tough to do while dorming and being poor, I used to drink heavily but have pretty much cut that out completely, haven't smoked weed in over 2 months, and the only drugs I've done in the past 6 months were mushrooms. I suppose the negativity is more of ""nah not trying to wake up at 5 right now"" ""I didn't fall asleep until 12 that's not enough sleep go back to bed"" etc. In other worrds, its really easy for me to rationalize going back to bed, and I'm not thinking clearly enough at that time to fight that urge.   So my question still is how do I change my routine, what strategies have you used that might be helpful？"
DecidingToBeBetter,318jut,KristjanHrannar,1 point,Fri Apr 3 08:01:37 2015 UTC,"Ok good to know, the reason I asked is because negativity in the morning is one of depression's key symptoms (and believe me, I've had some!). I've just been there so many times, drank heavily to fix myself, which only made matters worse, and when I tried to stop and I didn't have that fix the mornings became unbearable.   Concerning getting up, it might be helpful to look at your goals, not make them too difficult to begin with. Absolutism isn't helping. Make a weekly plan with ""Get up before x"" and give yourself a smiley when you do. After three or four weeks, see if you are getting any improvement. Even if you have relapses, it's just good to know where you stand.  Second of all, if you can't help it when you get up, you can decide when to go to bed. Don't use laptop or phone in bed, reserve it just for sleeping. Half an hour before you go to bed, prepare yourself mentally (dim the lights, be mindful about your surroundings, have a cup of relaxing tea etc). Don't jump into bed straight away after watching TV, your mind will still be spinning. Unwinding your mind helps. If you lie awake longer than 20-30 minutes, read a book. And don't force yourself too much. It took you months to get into this cycle, and it will take months to get out of it. Good luck!  I could write a ton more, but will let this suffice for now."

DecidingToBeBetter,310an2,Stargazer34,7,Wed Apr 1 12:36:51 2015 UTC,It doesn't work like that. Tried it before e.g. going out every day and talking to strangers or do fitness exercises every day (different muscle groups ofc) and doing something for one month won't improve your life at all. It's important to start yes but there is no point in doing something for one month extensively and then you burn out from it (exaggerated) and simply quit.   TL;DR The way you improve your life is to create habits and apply the changes on your regular basis.

You have one month time and want to get the maximum out of it, start with food. After eating healthy for a couple of days, you will have way more energy, more concentration, you will sleep better and you will get an extra boost because you physically feel that you have changed something.   And then you can use that energy wherever you want, be it educational, physical, spiritual :)"

But I imagine if you must do this in one month, what area do you need to improve? What are some negative behaviors that are so drastic that they need to get modified so soon? I guess a good coverall would be to 1. Exercise daily 2. Stop eating fast food and soda. 3. Feed your spirit (church, being thankful, being kind, loving others). 4. Feed your mind, read a book on sales or business, watch online an online university class about mathematics or some other subject like  science, fine art, take a painting class, learn a new language. Do something along the lines of those four options over the course of thirty days."
DecidingToBeBetter,310an2,ZoticusTurpin,3,Wed Apr 1 03:45:15 2015 UTC,Travel and do the things you never have time for. That would give you some change in perspective that isn't easy to get.

DecidingToBeBetter,310an2,midastouch42,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:26:10 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be playful with this comment and take it on face value. If I had one month to dramatically produce some lasting change in my life, I don't think the solution people are saying like diet, exercise, and mental health are it. What I really need, what would really give me a leg up in my life, is just more money. I was in the military and got a GI bill to pay for college, but half way through my degree I changed majors, and now my Gi bill is spent. Being as I have a wife to pay for I still need money so I have to work alot and more than anything bills are everywhere all the time, and it effects my education.  So if it was demanded of me to improve my life I would get rich quick, and probably the only way to do that would be illegally. I have thought about banks, stores, etc. for a good place to case, but after a time I think the best places to hit would be pawn shops. The security is extremely low in most, almost non existent at night, and they tend to leave the jewelry out in display cases at night. So on just one night after a couple weeks of casing the places I would rob about a dozen pawn shops out of state for there jewelry, and just that. Then I would separate the gems from the gold and sell the gold for it melt value. That should net quite a bit of money in just gold value as a lump sum. From then on I would slowly sell the unmarked gems (some are tracked by serial) online for there best resale value as a monthly stipend.  Questions?"
DecidingToBeBetter,310an2,jgi,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:46:32 2015 UTC,"Spend the month meditating on what you can control and what you cannot. You can only control yourself, your actions, your feelings. Everything else in life is outside of your control. Unhappiness stems from believing you can control something outside of yourself and then getting disappointed when it doesn't work out like you wanted.  We expend so much effort trying to control the uncontrollable. Some people work themselves silly trying to acquire money and power just so they feel they have some control in their life. They do not have control. Steve Jobs, a visionary and billionaire, still died of a nasty cancer. We will all die. We don't know when that will be. Revel in it and be happy! You can control how you react to the externals. You can make decisions on your actions. You can play by your own rulebook.  Once you realize this, everything else will fall into place."

DecidingToBeBetter,30x0kg,MALEDICTIONS,1 point,Wed Apr 1 08:20:36 2015 UTC,I'm going to agree with you on this one. You don't just decide to not be depressed anymore. It's usually a long process involving medication and repeat visit to the doctor. I think this type of post downplays how serious depression can be for some people.
DecidingToBeBetter,30yisy,pm-naked-indians,11,Tue Mar 31 19:08:21 2015 UTC,"I bloomed even later buddy, like 23 or 24. I over think as well; use it to your advantage. If you have a goal in mind, use the over thinking to plan out all the small details and possible hiccups that may occur. Use that over thinking to make sure it won't matter if you're the last kid picked for the team; go make your own team. (with blackjack, and hookers!)  Find an outlet, If you can play the guitar, even just a little, practice that shit! Get better! I can't play an instrument at all. If you can get good at something like that would it improve your self worth? It'd make me feel like a badass if I could. You'd be surprised how little it takes to impress people. Learn a few songs and go sit out somewhere and play so people can see you excelling at your skill. Sit at a park or something like that and just jam. If someone tells you ""you suck"", tell them to fuck off. I bet you'll get more people giving you positive feedback than negative.   The point is; turn your negatives into positives. You've got to find the things you like about yourself and nurture those aspects and try to fix the things you don't like but accept that SOME things  can't be changed. That's where self-love comes from. I could talk about this in length; I struggled with the same issues (more or less), trying to define myself and figure out who I was/am. That's pretty much the point of life I think; to end up being the best, whole person you can be.   I honestly remember feeling like I was behind the curve when I was 19. I really do. But stay motivated, stay open to what people are willing to share with you (if you're observant you'd be surprised what you can learn from others' experiences), and I know it's hard but stay positive. That is still hard for me. I try to keep the things that bring me down in perspective; like, is ""x"" really THAT bad when there is so much worse shit people have been through? It doesn't dismiss your problems but it won't make them seem as big.   I'm not going to lie and say I still don't get depressed sometimes, but I just keep going everyday, trying to make myself a better version than the day before. Because at the end of the day, you are the effort you put into yourself. If you are strong and kind to yourself, others will take notice.   That was kinda long, does that help?  P.S. I'm 28, so don't think this is coming from some wise 50 year old guy whose seen it all, I'm still learning just like everyone else."
DecidingToBeBetter,30yisy,Giggles10001110,5,Tue Mar 31 22:25:46 2015 UTC,"Life is not a race. Why measure yourself against the rest of the ""pack""? The people you are measuring yourself against may not be able to do the things you do or possess the skills you have.  Take things slow. The fact that you have realised that there are issues in your life and that things need to change is the first step. A lot of the way you are feeling is down to self-loathing. You want to stop hating yourself? Become the person you want to be. There is nothing and no one stopping you but yourself. Get in shape, you said you've already started, continue with that. Improve your diet, more often than not a better diet can help with depression. It did with me.   Rather than spending time on Facebook or Reddit or video games, do things that you enjoy and that further yourself. Learn a language, read more books, get outside. Join an acting class, improve the skills you clearly already have and meet new people who enjoy the same things you do in the process.  You are loved. Your family love you. Your friends love you. You will be loved by another girl/boy romantically again. You can appeal to others romantically by being an interesting person who is in shape and possesses skills and passions.  Bad things happen in life, sure, but we only grow as people through struggle and you'll almost always come out stronger and wiser for it.   Make sure you are doing something to improve and better yourself everyday. Even if it is just one chapter of a book read, one pushup pushed, one stranger smiled at. Why give up now? Look back at the person you were in the mental hospital. That guy would probably kill to be out where you are today. You going to tell that guy you're giving up?  Who do you want to be in 10 years time? Not what. But who? That person is already waiting for you, hoping you make all the right steps to getting to where they are. Don't let them down."

Do things at your own pace. There's no rush.  Practice things you enjoy, and do well in them. Immerse yourself in achieving higher. Don't do things half-assed and it will pay off. Be the team player, and soon you'll be surprised finding yourself being picked first.   Instead of looking down at the floor, look up at the sky. Believe and you will achieve.   The trick to being happy it to look at how things will go out amazingly instead of seeing things in the future negatively. What is happening to you is the nocebo effect, you have to be more positive and create your strengths."
DecidingToBeBetter,30yisy,Anjz,3,Tue Mar 31 22:45:26 2015 UTC,"Oh don't worry! I was so upset when I was 19 years old because I was working at a shitty movie theater that was run by an abusive boss. I lived in a shitty city with shitty parents and I didn't have any friends I could trust (save one or two, but only to talk to). I had severe General Anxiety Disorder and some bad, baaaad depression that my mother refused to get looked at because ""No child of mine is crazy"". I felt just like that, like I was no good and useless and I was just going to go nowhere in life because this was all I had.  I'm 26 now, and have been doing alright for three years. I sought help with therapy, but eventually had to move to taking Bupropion for my anxiety and depression (If you haven't tried it and your depression isn't right yet, maybe try it! The side effects are only temporary and I stopped a lot of my bad habits within 2 weeks. It also doesn't wreck you like SSRIs do). I'm still struggling a little bit with not feeling useless, but it's okay.  I went to a technical college and will be graduating with an AAS in accounting in a month. despite doing poorly in high school (well, not awful, I graduated with a 3.4 /: ) and my first run in college (mostly because I was forced to drop out), I've got a 4.0 this time and that has really boosted my self-confidence in a big way.   I changed my habits. This is very difficult if you're anything like me. I started eating healthier-- you don't know how much diet changes your overall mood until you try it--, sleeping more (even if you can't get on a schedule proper) will also help you. Play your guitar, work out, express your creativity. It really helped me back when I was younger.  It won't happen overnight. Though the bupropion took away a lot of the bullshit, the self-hatred stopped, the depression was lifted, I still have to work through my social anxiety, my self confidence and, more specifically, my self-doubt. I'm in a place now where I can evaluate myself without wanting to cry or make things worse. If you can get here, you will have half the battle down.  Tell me about you. Are you in school? Are you taking a break from school to work? What do you do for yourself-- specifically for you, be it fun or relaxation or whatever. How is your social life, and how do you prefer it to be?  I'd really like to hear back. I don't know if I can help, but you sound a lot like me and if I can give you even one shred of advice that will help, I would be glad to. Take care."

I would go even further to say they stem from a lack of self understanding. What I mean by that is...   Have you ever taken the time to really reflect on who you are and what is important to you...what you love.. what your strengths are? To the point where if someone came up to you in the street and asked the following, you would be able to answer without hesitation..  1. Define your core values in life and rank them in order of importance. - In my opinion there are 6-7 core values for everyone - Example: Spirituality/Freedom/Purpose, Health (Mental/Physical), Family, Social/Friends, Work, Education/Personal Development, - Think back when you were a child - what were you doing when you were having the most fun? what character traits were YOU?  2. Define your virtues in life. - Virtues are character traits or qualities that you value in life.  - Examples: Integrity, honesty, humbleness, excellence, love, sharing, lifelong learner etc... the list can go on  3. Define your key principles in life. - Principles are the law of your life. They help you make decisions for the different situation in life.   I encourage you to take the time and start there. Really understand who you are now, so you can understand where you want to go and have confidence in those steps forward."

Hack way: read into Buddhism and realize the 'self' that you loathe doesn't really exist. There is no continuous 'ego' that exists through time, and it's impossible to carry guilt. Guilt is just a song that's playing over and over in your head. Shut down the ego and the song can't play any more. The ego is not the mind. The ego is a program that runs within the mind. The mind is a fragile network of cells. If you want to think about this more, start with Sam Harris' Waking Up."

DecidingToBeBetter,30xvpg,GoldenOtter,1 point,Wed Apr 1 10:44:11 2015 UTC,"Hey man. 21 is just a legal age where people have decided for you whether you are an adult or not. Physiologically, you've got another 4 or 5 years.   Also, hey. you've completed a step a LOT of people don't: You admit to your faults and you seem to understand where they stem from. This means you can work them out.  It's okay to be sensitive, it's okay to be weak-- not everyone has the will of a steel elephant, y'know? all you have to do is work on it.  You already have a list of your faults. Maybe try writing this list down, and next to them, write down in a few words what you can do to help. Are you lazy? Make it a point to do one or two household chores every day. Write it down when you do. Keep a journal-- this will give you a concrete thing to look at when you're feeling down about yourself! Make notes of when you do things that better yourself. Do you go to the gym? Maybe you could try! That would certainly count.   Insecure and envious are a little trickier. I was insecure in the way I really needed attention because I never got the kind I needed from family and friends. I never had a problem being envious, but what makes you say you are insecure? What are you envious of? What makes you angry? You're already getting inside yourself, but you must go deeper. What can't you do for yourself? Cooking? Laundry? These things can be learned. Easily! I didn't start cooking until I was 23, and while it started with boxes, I now cook completely from scratch.   You can do this. You can do whatever you want. You're not a car. Think of yourself more as a computer that's got some viruses. All you gotta do is do a scan-- seek some therapy if you have to, it's really only a help-- and start cleaning them out. It's not quite as easy as a computer's anti-virus, but each step closer to your goal is a file that's been cleaned.   Also, please remember that success and recovery is not one straight line up. To learn how to walk you first must be able to hold your head up, roll over, stand up, and there's an awkward phase where you're slapping your feet on the ground. That isn't being useless or bad at something. That is learning. And in that process you're going to fall. You may fall once or you may fall many times. Whichever the path is, it's okay.  You still have your parents. You have at least one friend. Talk to your parents- it seems like you have a pretty good relationship with them- and see if there's anything they can help with. Ask if there's anything to learn. Everyone has something to teach.  I really hope I've been able to help. Try to stay positive and remember that there is a huge difference in just one year."

With that said, you are taking the first step. That is being fed up with who you are and where you are going. It means deep down you want a change and that's a good thing. Some people go through their entire lives without that self-awareness.   Second thing is, start slow. Don't beat yourself up if you have a bad day or are lazy one morning. Nothing happens overnight. Find 2 areas in your life you can make improvement in tomorrow. Make your bed and fill out a job application. Or whatever. Just the fact that you are doing them is important.   What you will find (or what I found) is that I enjoy getting shit done. It makes me feel good. And that just compounded and I rolled with it. I got a good job because I filled out job applications, I got a gf because I started going to the gym and went out after work instead of sitting at home playing League again.

I isolated myself in high school, became super social and well-liked for my first two years of college, and am now crawling out of a major relapse (probably around 6 months) of spending as little time with people as possible.  You can't just change everything about yourself at once with one grand master-plan to be awesome. Get in a rhythm in one area of improvement and then slowly add one thing at a time.  I always feel exercise is the best place to start because I've always found it really helpful towards my mental health."

DecidingToBeBetter,30uh0r,silveri5,13,Tue Mar 31 09:21:37 2015 UTC,"You're not wasting your life away, yet. You're still young and able to make any choice you want.   With that being said you lack discipline and conviction.    I can't stay motivated to do anything!   You can't rely on motivation to be your driving force. Discipline is what will get you through the tough times and, luckily for you, discipline is a choice that you can make. You can choose to be disciplined.   You can make a decision today about how you're going to live your life in the future, but you need to make an important decision. You need to decide what you're committed* to having in your life, and what you're interested* in having in your life.   Tony Robbins nails this one on the head and this is an excerpt from his book, Awaken the Giant Within:    Think for a moment. Is there a difference between being interested in something, and being committed to it? You be there is! Many times people say things like, ""Gosh, I really would like to make more money,"" or ""I'd like to be closer to my kids,"" or ""You know, I'd really like to make a difference in the world."" But that kind of statement is not a commitment at all. It's merely stating a preference, saying, ""I'm interested in having this happen, if I don't have to do anything."" Not only do you have to decide what results you are committed to, but also the kind of person that you're committed to becoming.    From the brief overview you gave, you also seem to lack goals. Have you ever set goals that were definable/quantifiable? That's a great place to start. Decide what you want out of life and make the decision to actually pursue that goal. Commit yourself to succeeding. Don't say I should/could/would. Say I will. I will go to the gym today. I will keep my room clean. I will pursue my dream job. I will travel the world. Commit, commit, commit. Remember that there is no such thing as ""failure"" in life. It is merely the lack of results. If you ""fail"" realize that you didn't get the desired result and try again. Reassess your situation, reformulate your plan, and commit yourself. If you truly choose to be the person you want to be, you cannot fail.   Most of the other things on your list will solve themselves when you begin to make conscious choices about your life. When you commit to the gym, your confidence will go up. When you commit to getting that new job, you'll grow as a person. When you find that new hobby, you'll find something that makes you happy. When you begin reading more, you'll become more interesting.   To start, I'd highly recommend reading the book I quoted earlier. It really helped get my initial burst of motivation in taking control of my life. It had some very good parts to it. I'd also recommend some philosophy readings from the Stoics (Letters from a Stoic - Seneca, or Meditations - Marcus Aurelius) to help you get control of your emotions and self-pity.   Lastly, I'd like to recommend one trick to help jump start your motivation. I call it the 10-seconds of laziness trick. Don't fall victim to anything that can be solved with less than 10 seconds of work. Just finished that bowl of cereal and put it in the sink? Don't! Take the extra ten seconds to put it into the dishwasher. Throw your shirt on the ground? Don't! Take the extra ten seconds to put it in the bin. You'll notice everything is less of a drag on you and that you'll start building good habits this way.   Good luck man."

DecidingToBeBetter,30uh0r,ZombieJorge,21,Tue Mar 31 13:30:59 2015 UTC,"Your first problem is that you identify with your brain. Your mind is an instrument you should ideally choose to use (and choose when not to use). Whenever that voice begins saying negative things, learn to accept them for what they are and then let them pass right through you. I suggest reading The Power of Now if you really want to understand that you =/= your mind.  Secondly, you need to form habits. Good habits are the cornerstone of bettering yourself. You say you know who you want to become. That's a good start, you already have a goal in mind. But this can be a double edged sword. What I mean by this is it can lead to you being frustrated when things aren't coming fast enough. (You shouldn't however for reasons I explained above).  Bettering yourself is a process. You're not going to do it all in once. So separate the different aspects of the process in to managable steps. Maybe even write it down and hang it up somewhere. The more you look at it, the better. That way you'll really understand that it really is possible to attain.   But make sure that you start small. For example: drink less soda and more water or take the steps instead of the elevator. And slowly build on these habits. Remember that forming habits takes a while (a month at least iirc). So stay conscious of the things you're trying to achieve throughout your day.  Now, I don't wanna be cheesy but in the end it all comes down to the fact that you only have one life. So take every opportunity -and by this I mean every day, hour, minute even- you can get and make the most of it. Oh and know that you'll never be perfect. Your process you wrote down never really ends, you can always improve upon yourself. If you keep these things in mind, I think you have a good shot of improving your overall hapiness.  As for the whole subreddits you lurk in, reading these can be helpful but ultimately you're gonna have to actually go outside and do stuff instead of sitting behind a desk reading about them.

One thing I've realised is the snow balling effect is completely true as soon as you do one thing the next thing will be easier and you just keep going with it.

They paint a very grim picture of who they believe women are (shallow, manipulative, conceited, etc) and then exercise ""techniques"" that, surprise, attract exactly those type of women (again, insecure women). It's a sad cycle for both sides."

And if I don't say that I am a woman, and that I disagree, I am just doing myself a disservice, aren't I? I will not be cowed into silence simply because he said he reads that trash.

DecidingToBeBetter,30uh0r,kelpants,1 point,Tue Mar 31 05:23:17 2015 UTC,"Interacting with women in the real world :) It's very easy to imagine that an anonymous voice on the internet is not a representative of ""normal"" because there's no way to gauge them other than one statement in a vacuum, so it's super easy to dismiss what people say for any reason, so sometimes, in my opinion, it does make sense to try to discuss on their terms, if it means helping them understand. I know what you're saying though.  Honestly, I do think the ""red pill"" peeps have one thing right - PLENTY of people say they want one thing and then really want another. Of course this goes for both genders, but it's really not as simple as saying ""all women (or all men) want X"" - including ""wanting to be treated equal"", which to many means ""treat me the same as you would a man"". I know LOTS of women that want to be in a ""traditional"" relationship with all the lame trappings of divided roles and ""happy wife happy life"" bullshit.  Stay away from generalizations as much as possible, is all I'm sayin. One day I hope they do all just want to be treated equal... sigh"

There's a lot of gunk in there but the core belief is just to become a better man. Respect people but first and fore most respect your self. Don't let people and life walk all over you and make you always feel inadequate. Ever. I've helped a lot of struggling dudes on their and I like that sub. I just take mainly about 25% of what people say one there to heart. Just do what makes you happy and don't let other people tell you what that is. You have to feel that for yourself though. It's with in you you just have to find it yourself.   That being said. No girl will ever help you unless you're already there by yourself. Finding salvation in outside resources is always going to be superficial.

The independence will give you more confidence to do the other things you want to do. Get your ass back to the gym, make some sick gainz and stop making excuses. Things aren't going to change over night it's going to take time. Your current image of yourself is not good obviously and you said the only thing stopping you from doing the things you want is you. So mentally destroy and erase that part of you and rebuild yourself as the person you want to be. I don't know another way to phrase that but basically you need to build your self confidence up from scratch.   For a start, you could practice self affirmations. They sound dumb but it actually works. Just repeat confidence building phrases over and over again to yourself until you begin to believe it.   Dude dw I was where you were a few years ago and I'm still trying to push the limits of my comfort zone and improve myself everyday.

DecidingToBeBetter,30wbu7,ZeroAurora,2,Tue Mar 31 05:54:40 2015 UTC,"What you just wrote sounds almost exactly like my college experience, to a freakin T. Graduated 13th place (nominal, not %) in a magnet high school - we sent over 40 kids to ivy leagues during my year. I literally had to do no work except maybe in AP Calc and Physics. I wrote my English AP final paper literally the period before it was due - single write through with no proofing. Coasting was awesome, but it was also the worst thing.  Because of our ""gifted"" status, and the inability of the public school system to challenge people like us, we never learned what it is like to work really hard for something. As you're finding out now, that ish don't fly at college. You gotta put in the hours to succeed. I instead became a rather epic WoW player. I don't want to admit, even on reddit, the # of MONTHS of game time I logged. It's horrific, in retrospect, how much of my life I spent chasing virtual goodies that I ended up abandoning anyway.   Fortunately for you, you've got time to turn it all around. Unfortunately for me, I never did. It took me 6 years of working an OK but really mediocre and, and this is key, intellectually unstimulating job to finally realize that if I wanted to live the life I imagined (and know myself capable of achieving), I would need to make some serious life changes.  So I can't tell you any eazy way out. I can only tell you that you don't really understand how much it's costing you. Sure there's the GPA and and girl prospects. But it's even more far reaching than that. This is the time that will dictate the next at least 5-10 years of your life. It is the difference between a boring 9-5 and you dream job. Settling for someone or finding the woman of your dreams. Worrying about rent and taking Eurotrips on a whim. College is fun, but you have no idea how much fun there is beyond - and how completely debilitating to know and see what you could have had, if you had only put in the effort to get it.  So, don't be me! It took me 6 years to turn my life around. But don't get discouraged. Don't beat yourself up. Forgive your past self. This is key. You do yourself absolutely no good by not letting go of your mistakes. Admit to them. Own them. And then let them go.  Because it's never too late, better late than never, etc etc etc... And you are coming to this realization sooner than later, and you are admitting that you have this problem. This is awesome. Now you can do something about it!  Start small. Well, you may not have the option with this paper due today - you just need to push through it. But with that out of the way, start small. Little changes.   For fitness, do 10 push-ups. Right now. It takes no more than a minute or two. Can't do 10? Do 5. Or 3. Heck, do ONE.   Social skills? Join a university club or team. Stick with something that interests you. Go out to a bar alone. It doesn't matter if at first you feel awkward and weird. Just keep going or switch and try something else. Doesn't have to be often, doesn't mean you'll have fun right away. But do it.  School work? Again; small chunks. Got 60 pages to read? Read 5. Or 3. Or even one!  Because change is incremental and requires not just new habits but also new ways of thinking, ones you aren't used to. If you try to change everything without your mind adapting, you'll crash and end up right where you began. The concept im referring to is something I read on a different reddit post (can't find link now, so doing best to paraphrase). It is the concept of no more zero days.  What's a zero day? A day that you do nothing to advance your goals. And that's why I say, do something small, but do it every day. Read one page. Write one paragraph. Code one subroutine. Do one push-up. 11:59pm on the clock and haven't done anything yet? You still got a minute to make it into something - fortunes have been made and lost in less time. Do that one thing because 1 is more than nothing.  What you'll find is, once you do that one (which is easy mentally), soon you've got energy for two. And then 5. And on and on it goes. It will snowball and one day you will look at yourself and not even remember how you could be any other person.  You'll stumble. You'll fall. And that's ok. You are human. Forgive yourself past self when you do. And when you succeed, THANK yourself. Explore that feeling of self satisfaction and accomplishment and cheer yourself on. Even if it's for just doing the one push-up. Because 1 > 0.  Edit: Found the original post. Read it.

DecidingToBeBetter,30wbu7,B4SSF4C3,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:35:20 2015 UTC,There is an entire process to help you really connect with the goals you set.   To start off.   The first goal you have - build internal motivation - I would argue that motivation is built up from setting goals you want to achieve.. that you are passionate about doing. Ask yourself the why to each of your goals. I want to build internal motivation.. why? Because you want to build better habits? because you want to accomplish more? Or because you want to feel energized? Break those down until you find the reason behind that goal.   Let me know the results. Thanks!

Look up NOBNOM by Tim Ferriss as a side note. Music Improv - if it's something you could see yourself doing, it's a very positive, fun environment. Experience Flow - I feel like finding a hobby / work you can be incredibly invested in makes the moment so much more enjoyable. Gratitude - crucial, especially when things are going well, I find! Personal Development - really worked for me. I used to listen up to 3 hours a day, and it would help me find a better direction in my life (combine this with cognitive reappraisal). Volunteer Exercise (generally): Best mood booster. I actually get fitter when I exercise how to improve my mood vs. improving some physical attribute (personally).

Or, if you really want it you'll find a way, if not, you'll find an excuse.  No more excuses.  You, and you alone, are responsible for the current state of your life.  You have autonomy and the ability to make choices.  Your environment doesn't matter.  Moving to a new place won't change you, you'll just be the same person with different stuff around you.  That's lazy thinking.  If you really want to change you have to be prepared to work hard and be uncomfortable.  There are not tricks, no cure alls, no overnight successes.  We don't need to tell you what to do, you already know what your weaknesses are.  Pick a small challenge, and work on it.  Diet, exercise, paying bills on time, cleaning, getting enough sleep, ironing your cloths, shining your shoes, polishing your coin collection, whatever.  Work on it until you fix it, no matter how long it takes.  Then, once you've proven to yourself that yes, you can do this, pick another thing and improve that.  The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.  The second best time is right now.  If you take responsibility, stop blaming others, and work on yourself, you'll be grateful in 20 years.

DecidingToBeBetter,30tlkq,a_dago_ate_my_baby,2,Mon Mar 30 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, it's not about loathing or loving. It's about habits.  It's important to understand what a 'habit' actually is, and I'll supply a dramatic example you're probably familiar with: the commuter's space-out.  Most people who drive the same route to work everyday eventually admit (often uncertainly, for fear of judgement or consequence) that they have had the experience, at some point, of not remembering that drive, either to or from work. For some, it's common and they get used to it, though they are still reluctant to acknowledge it and may even lie about it it. For some others, it's a rare or one-time thing that startles and concerns them (though again, they might not talk about it). It is almost certainly much more common than surveys or people's admissions suggest.  For most, the general experience is that they remember leaving, but little else before reaching work. Sometimes nothing at all. Most startling (especially for those who don't know what's going on) is the experience of 'waking up' just in time to avoid some accident. But an interesting detail is that near-accident is almost never their own fault, but someone else's. That's an important clue to what's going on here.  What's common to all these experiences is that they are all the product of firmly established habits. There are different kinds of habits, but the most durable of all is this hardwired kind. And the term is not allegorical, but nearly literal: If you repeat the same action enough times, your brain eventually builds physical structures that provide the most efficient pathway for performing it. The purpose of that is to relieve your thinking mind of tasks that are well-practiced enough that your brain can do them automatically, without you having to think about them consciously. That frees your higher mind -- your thinking mind -- for tasks that demand that level of analytical cognition.  Hence, the space-out: Once you're on the road, your brain shifts that task to the dedicated structure it's provided for it, and your conscious mind is then free to wander, and often will. You 'wake up' once you have completed the task, and need to start paying attention again. It's a bit like a railway conductor waking you up at your stop, when you need to take over the task of moving yourself around.  This is not nearly as dangerous as it sounds, and it's likely not dangerous at all for most people. Your unconscious brain is quite likely at least as good a driver as your conscious mind, since it's able to focus on the task without distraction. It will alert you if it requires analytical or executive function -- if something outside the practiced routine of the habit occurs -- and that's why some have the startling experience of 'coming to' in time to avoid an accident. (Note that this is entirely different from 'drifting off at the wheel,' meaning falling asleep -- which kills many people every year. Your conscious mind remains awake and alert, and 'on call,' but no longer needs to do all the fussy things you have learned through repetition.)  This is what musicians are trying to achieve with practice. They call it muscle memory. Their brains learn what to do and how to do it automatically, so that they no longer have to think about it consciously. This is also why martial artists practice the same moves over and over, to train their body to respond without thinking. In time, they can perform the move reflexively, before they're even consciously aware of it. When Bruce Lee said to fear the man who has practiced the same punch a thousand times, this is what he was talking about.  It's the reason police and armed forces run simulations over and over, so that in the heat and stress of conflict, they'll respond without having to think about it, and do the right thing in the right away at the right time. It's why firemen run drills, and why athletes practice all the things they do over and over and over. They're all trying to build those physical pathways that we call habits.  A habit isn't just an action you repeat. It's a part of you, a part of your psyche. Given enough time, anything you repeat enough, in the same way, becomes a habit, until it not only becomes automatic, but you don't feel quite right if you don't do it. Try taking a different route to work to see what I mean; it feels a bit weird, even though objectively it's the same task with the same purpose and result. The habit is built of many discrete details, though, and contradicting them is what creates the sense of confusion or anxiety.  When we talk about 'breaking' a habit, we are using a misnomer. Short of some kind of trauma, you can't really 'break' an ingrained habit, because it's literally part of you. But you can overcome it, through determined practice and repetition of contradictory actions. To quit smoking, you don't 'break' the habit of smoking, but instead build the contradictory habit of not smoking.  It may sound like a merely semantic difference, but it's not: You defeat a habit by 1) reducing or eliminating reinforcing actions and 2) practicing contradictory actions. This process is called extinction. It takes time and determination, and the transition also creates a sense of confusion, which may make you feel uncertain, anxious, or psychologically uncomfortable in other ways. The challenge is to persevere through that discomfort, until the balance shifts from the old habit to the new. From that point forward, it gets easier.  Up to that point, however, it can be an uneasy ride. One trouble many people have (I did, too, just about every time I've used this technique) is what's known as an extinction burst. This is the brain's instinctive attempt to gain expected results by repeating practiced actions, in the hopes that that persistence will work out. Wikipedia's section on this is pretty dry, and hard to follow if you're not in the field (source: am not in field), so I suggest this much clearer explanation from David McRaney's excellent blog (and book), You Are Not So Smart.  (One note: He seems to say that the extinction I've described above is a 'misconception'. That is hyperbole on his part -- a dramatic or forensic device to emphasize a point through exaggeration -- and should not be taken literally. Extinction does work. It's just not as simple or easy as it sounds. This page describes one of the most challenging complications that can arise, and a common point of failure for those who don't fully understand the process so that they can work through it and get past it. You're not going to be one of those, though, because you're learning all about it right now.)  From my own experience of quitting smoking, I will next give you pointers on what worked for me, how I did it, and why I believe those methods worked. These are not 'tricks'. A trick is something that is not what it seems, or that appears to accomplish something it shouldn't, or something illusory. Everything I'm saying here is real, and based entirely in reality. There are no shortcuts, no easy workarounds. You accomplish this by ploughing straight through the problem headlong. It may sound like the hardest way, but it's actually the shortest, fastest, and most reliable.  (The next part is appended to this comment as a sub-comment.)"
DecidingToBeBetter,30tlkq,sylban,3,Mon Mar 30 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"It took me seven tries to quit smoking, over a period of nearly ten years. But it got easier each time, because I paid attention to what worked and what didn't, and tried to figure out why. So I went into each successive attempt armed with more and better knowledge, and more awareness of myself and my responses. I don't even remember the point where I finally quit, it was that undramatic.  You must forgive yourself. Shame is a common factor that weighs people down and holds them back. You must accept that humans are animals, only recently risen from the grasslands, and we are driven by many ancient and primitive instincts we find very hard to control. Your dog doesn't decide to panic when there's thunder; he does it automatically. The bulk of human behaviour is, on some level, only extensions of those ancient instincts. Overcoming them through sheer willpower and determination is hard. So don't be ashamed if you fail. Just assess what happened, try to learn from it, and apply that knowledge the next time. However many tries it takes. It's common to fail at something hard the first time or two or few you try it, or even many. So don't let it get you down. And also don't let anyone else get you down about it. They may have their opinions, but that's all they are. All that matters is what's actually true, and if you know what that is -- that some things can be hard -- then you can just deal with that, and ignore all that background noise.  Persistence is key. Habits require reinforcement, or they will fade. The old saw about riding a bike is only partly true: If you haven't done it in a long time, the reality is that you'll suck at it and stand a good chance of falling over. What it really refers to is the fact that once you've learned something, it's easier to re-familiarize yourself with it. You do need to relearn how to ride a bike; but this time will take you only seconds to remember the basics, so you're less likely to fall down immediately. You still can and might, though, because your muscle memory will have faded.  The first step in eliminating a habit is to do it less. In some cases, that means quitting 'cold turkey'. It's probably inadvisable to wean yourself off of something like heroin, for example. But habits that are not directly or immediately threatening to you, or do not function through changing how your brain works, you can take a bit at a time. Smoking, for example, alters your brain chemistry, so weaning is difficult; in that case, cold turkey is better, if you can do it. In your case, gradual reduction is likely to be the easiest way to reduce reinforcement of the existing habit.  Identify specific reinforcement behaviours associated with the habit. Pick ONE of them. Just one. Work on reducing and then eliminating that one action. When I was trying to quit smoking, the one I chose first was no smoking in the car. That was easy, in a way, because it was something I wanted to do, but I knew I'd still get to smoke later, so I was able to withhold that; in time, that little thing by itself became automatic, even though the rest of the habit remained. Over time, I added more limitations -- one by one, waiting until each took hold and felt natural and gave me no stress, before adding another.  This works best if you pair it with a complementary action. For example, when I wanted to cut down my ravenous desire for ice cream, I decided no more than one pint a week. It didn't matter what kind, just that it didn't exceed that number. Later, I added new flavours only. And so on. What this does is build the contradictory habit of not doing that particular thing. Over time, adding new details gradually whittles away at the main habit. If you do it slowly and carefully enough, you can avoid the extinction burst, because your brain is replacing old habits with new ones, instead of just feeling the loss of old ones.  Do not be arbitrary. There's a reason fitness clubs offer January deals: They know that many people make New Year's resolutions to get in shape. But a deal you make with yourself based on something arbitrary has no concrete meaning for the habitual parts of your brain, which are completely ignorant of things like calendars and social graces. Your habits don't care if you're unhappy or embarrassed or if they're killing you; they're just blind, dumb programmes your brain has learned to run automatically. They are not threatened by arbitrary promises. They are only affected by persistent conditioning.  Most habits include some kind of reward. It's not important what the reward is, or how big it is to your conscious mind, or if you even consciously like it. Your habit only cares that there's a predictable result to a given action. I developed the habit of brushing my teeth every night before sleep through sheer persistence; there's no direct concrete reward for it, but it's one of the elements of a routine that is part of the going-to-bed habit, so it became natural and expected -- to the point that if I forgot, my brain would keep poking me to get up and do it. That's the point you want to reach.  Messiness is an abstract, aesthetic concept. It has no meaning whatsoever to the lower parts of your mind where habits dwell, that drive our behaviours. Look at a dog or cat: What do they consider 'messy'? Nothing, that's what. They have no concept of that; it's strictly a concept of higher thinking that they do not possess. Your cat would think it ludicrous to move stuff around just so that it's somewhere other than it was. Who cares, as long as you can lay down?  For that reason, you cannot attack this on those terms, because habits can't understand it on that level. Habits only understand discrete, concrete, physical, real-world things. Tangibles.. A pizza box is a tangible object. If you have a habit of not discarding those, then pick that one thing to deal with. Train yourself to always remove the pizza box. Never mind anything else, just worry about that box. If you repeat that enough, often enough, it will become a habit, and you'll eventually find the box intolerable.  Once that becomes natural, to the point where you catch yourself doing it automatically, pick something else to focus on.  This approach might seem hopelessly painstaking, but I assure you, the mess is not unlimited. It's finite. There's only a certain number of details about it, and if you constantly work on eliminating just one at a time, you will eventually get to all of them.  Particularly because of this one last element: acceleration. If the goal is tidiness and cleanliness, then the above process will start to achieve that by sheer reduction alone, until that result itself increases as a predictable result, and one you'll start to pursue without even thinking about it consciously. You'll desire it, and work harder and more earnestly to achieve it, even if you didn't consciously intend to. The more you do it, the more that reinforces itself, and that acceleration of progress -- the shift of balance from messy to clean -- becomes its own set of complementary concrete habits that end in that abstract result.  Good luck. I know you can do it. I know you will. Because I did, and I'm not any better, smarter, or stronger than you are. I don't recall ever having the simultaneous courage and self-awareness to compose a post like yours, and I think that's a very hopeful sign. I want you to believe in yourself because I believe in you. Just remember that you're only human. Humans have enormous potential, once we learn the methods of tapping it. It's rarely easy, but mastery can deliver enormous rewards."

Edit:  So, just to illustrate, I'm just getting to the end of a book called ""Talent is Overrated"" (recommended by this sub).  In it, the author relates the story of Benjamin Franklin, certainly one of the most learned and witty gentlemen of his time.  In it a young Franklin is having an argument, over letters, with a friend over the rights of women (Ben is for them).  His father comes across these letters and informs Ben that while his letters are superior in the grammatical sense and in spelling, they are not in argument and wit (apologies, I can't remember the actual words used).  Ben realizes he needs to become a better arguer.  He realizes he lacks a good vocabulary.  He sets about studying people he admires, re-writing in his own words the arguments he reads, setting them aside and then later comparing the to see if they are as good.  He takes up poetry to further his vocabulary.  He does this for years, at night, on Sundays when he should have been at church, etc.  In this way he becomes one of the wittiest and most sanguine men of his time.

While I get leaving if there's a concrete opportunity, you risk setting yourself up for disappointment if you leave what seems to be a solid stable environment (education, relationships, roof over your head with what I assume is pretty cheap to no rent with your folks) for a ""change of setting"".

Both of my feet are on the ground, so therefore that means that I am alright. The logic is this: my feet are on the ground and it means I am connected to the foundation of my existence. Am I happy? Maybe, maybe not. But do I have a stance on this planet? Yes. I have my health, I have my true friends (you mentioned being at a friends house), I have the luck of being able to squeeze the grass beneath my feet in between my toes. If my feet are on the ground, I am where I am supposed to be. Here.   We are each given the opportunity to be here, alive. If you look at the statistics of the likelihood of you even being alive in this unforgiving universe, the chances are slim to none. But here you are. Celebrate that by having  the knowledge that as long as you can feel the ground beneath your feet, you are connected to this world.

There is something about taking off your shoes, sitting down in a quiet place, and letting your feet touch the grass. It reminds me that I am part of the world, I am HERE. If you have some nature that you love, go there and spend some time. Second on the days when I really felt like checking out, I would make a list of all the things I wanted to do. Places I wanted to see, foods i wanted to taste, sorts of adventures. And then I would start on that list with the idea that if i finished all that and still wanted to leave then I could consider it. But i never ever made it close to finishing. The point of the list is to take me outside of myself, outside of my normal life, and get me moving and thinking. Change of set and setting changed my mind, and meeting new people and adventuring made me want to stay. Another thing that helped was to change my company. I had very close friends that were all very destructive and kind of toxic. I started seeking people that I wanted to be like, that inspired me, that made me want to accomplish cool stuff too. I exercised when i was around them, i didnt drink as much, and i didnt behave in destructive ways. It was the beginning of changing my habits. Over time I found that i didnt want to leave my own life any more. And if you just want an internet stranger to chat with I am always here!

I'm a 22/f and I have been struggling with this thing for a while. It turned out that I was in fact in the throes of a pretty nasty episode of depression and I'm still not 100% out of the woods.  For what it's worth, I did not find counsellors to be helpful at all, but I did find a psychiatrist to be. I found that counsellors were good for people that were feeling down, or stressed- but this is something different, it's chemical, lifestyle and emotional and it is not enough to just white knuckle through it.   To start- tell your doctor exactly this. Find a proper mental care practitioner. Get informed about your options for care- head on over to /r/depression, you may find some comfort or something- and at least realize you're not alone in this. It definitely sounds like you're struggling with depression and the hard fact is, it is an illness. Try to think of what you're experiencing right now as being a physical injury, like a sprained ankle or fracture. You're going about life as if it's not sprained, but you're impeded by it. You've got to get that splint to make the mend!  Your hopelessness and sense of alienation are symptomatic of the injury. Luckily there are a lot of people out here in this world who can help and are willing to- but you have to let them know. Believe me, it's worth trying.  xo. Good luck to you."

From my experience lack of sleep will cause this lethargy, its not necessarily a tiredness but a zombie like apathy. Figure out a way to get a good and consistent sleep cycle. Maybe take a melatonin supplement 2 hours before bed. Turn the brightness down on your screens, being exposed to lights can keep you up. Consistency is the key to sleeping better.   Make sure you dont have any blood sugar problems, because it's well known that those can make you feel lethargic and apathetic... also spending a lot of time sitting/laying down can effect these blood sugar levels.  Life is always going to be a journey of discovering what makes you happy, so you're not alone on that front, we're all searching. Some figure it out faster than others, some don't. Self discovery is a lifelong process, and the mystery of it all is what makes it worth living, because any known future is just a past... the fact that we dont know whats going to happen tommorow, is what sets the stakes today. If you could tell the future, then what would be the point of doing anything, because you already know whats going to happen.  Isolation is a self fulfilling prophecy. We protect ourselves through isolation, and in the process alienate ourselves. Nature tells us that balance is the key to everything, so a good balance of being isolated and social is the key.  You're an artist and you can channel all of this into your art.. Maybe pretend to be your future self, and have that person write current you a letter. The possibilities are endless when it comes to articulating this confusion/pain you are feeling. Sometimes just expressing it through art is all you need. We all need mirrors to remind ourselves of who we really are.  baby steps, just takes small steps every day. You will get out of this funk. I know people who have been in funks for years and broke out. I honestly believe that these funks are our bodies way of telling us that something needs to change. Our subconscious is incredibly smart. INCREDIBLY SMART, thats why your dreams at night are photorealistic, and it's hard for us to replicate that beauty in waking life... Knowing this, your subconscious feels you need some sort of change, and its giving you this ""pain"" .  If you were raised by dogs, you would be barking right now. If you were raised by cats you'd be meowing. all we are is a reflection of our environment. If your environment is stagnant then you will feel stagnant. If you spend days perfectly still, watching tv, your heart will become a reflection of that stillness. Try new things every day. Take a different route to school. Listen to a new song. Life is another word for change. and if you want your heart to be bright and lively and happy, then make your external reality a reflection of that."

Often i get burned out and feel uninspired and unmotivated and I don't even remember why i got into it. It's really hard to find your voice, and especially when you don't have a lot of energy. It's a common idea that many famous artists harness their angst or depression and channel it into brilliant art. I've found it to be completely untrue for me. I produce my best work when i'm content, when i feel good about myself, and when i'm happy with my social life. When i feel like crap i don't do anything or produce anything.   I'm a bit awkward myself. I've gotten better though. I backpacked for a while and i spent a lot of time meeting new people on my trip. Every night it was a new hostel and new people and i got to sort of practice meeting people. I think small talk and general social skills are something that actually require practice. They atrophy if you don't use them.   If you can, you might try to find some social activities you can do, classes, volunteering etc. I understand some of these things conflict with your classes. You might try meetup.com. I've met a few people that way. One of them we just show up and doodle a list of things. A boat, a coathanger, a jar of peanut butter etc... half the people there aren't pros (myself included), but it doesn't matter. We just draw and chit chat. And i think half the people there are lonely or looking for friends, or just trying to connect like me, so I don't feel so nervous about it.   I guess to end, the best thing for me has been activities where i don't necessarily have to talk to people. That way i don't feel like i'm on stage, or have to perform. If that's volunteering at an art thing or taking a class or whatever, then it's not about socializing -- it's about doing whatever i'm supposed to do and not about how fabulous i need to be so that people will like me. And simply being involved in whatever thing it is, and just being around people, it's helpful for me."

I would also say explore some different stuff related to art. For me, fine art was too nebulous so I started to sway towards design and by doing this discovered a whole world of stuff I wasn't even aware of. Be curious and explore some new things.  Have you considered getting a part time job? As crazy as I sounds, having some structure (as in you have to be somewhere at a certain time) might be just what you need.

I've had these depressive states before, and if it wasn't for my shitty job I probably would have spiraled down into depression, as odd as that sounds. It taught me to schedule, to take better care of myself so I can be there for others, to exercise every day (if you bike to work). I also could socialize lightly with people about things, while always being able to default to a conversation topic related to work if your and their personality aren't compatible. That's how I slowly built confidence in chatting up others.  One of the best things for depression, I think, is taking ourselves out of the picture (since we will absolutely get lost in our own minds when we are pensive, anxious, and stressed out) and learning to help and value service to other people. This could mean volunteering but in your context I would try looking for part-time work at some semi-public work environment. The opposite of helping depression is fapping too much (which is just empty dissociation which provides zero enrichment) and going on social media too much (which just increases envy and makes us feel more isolated and left out than we actually are. You're comparing your bloopers with everyone else's highlight reels on FB).  Another good first step you can take is to do a chore a day, like sweeping up your place or doing laundry or keeping your desk and clutter under control as much as possible. Eating a good healthy meal and avoiding junk counts too. If you do this, in spite of all the other perceived problems you have you can at least say, ""today, I helped myself out, and did future-me a favor."" Then next day you get up and you express gratitude for your past self for deciding to help you out for a change. This makes you feel better about doing another chore or responsibility the second day, since you know there is a reward. Of course if we are not thinking along the lines of being able to help or work with others (in this case it's working with ourselves at multiple points throughout time) then we won't see the point of working on ourselves to build self-esteem. We will just focus on what's pleasurable and entertaining to us now. That kind of approach just makes normal people hate themselves.  Anyway these are all just suggestions. Some will work for some people and some for others. Hugs."

You have to make things happen.  For starters, if you think you want to be an artist, you can figure out the answer to that pretty quickly... find some freelance art sites and try to pickup a few jobs.   Find a meetup.com group that you're interested in and that meets weekly. Start going and you'll make friends there eventually. Get your license. Only masturbate before bed, this may help you fall asleep Don't go on social media at night Don't go to the gym at night   And of course, talk to your doctor (or a doctor in your school's health facility). Don't some of these things, try all of them."

First, it's great that you're going to the gym, because taking care of your body can not only give you confidence, but improves your mental outlook. Part of this is to start making a schedule and sticking to it for 30 days. My current plan is to start small - wake up at 8:00am without snoozing, make my smoothie and be at school by 9:00am every weekday. It may also be cheesy, but I have made 30 cue cards with inspiring quotes on them. Each day I grab one and put it beside my desk where I can see it and always be reminded of my goals. I have also been reading the infamous 7 habits of highly effective people on nights when I am not busy and avoiding looking at my smartphone and doing random sh*t.  A good friend of mine gave me some simple but powerful advice - simply BE the person you want to be. It's definitely not easy, but if you can change your inner thoughts to : I am a happy, confident, smart and worthy person you will eventually start to become it."

It's just that the depressing feeling comes in spells and it gets harder to recover from them. I want to say it because I'm graduating soon and I stressed out for whats ahead because I feel as though I gave nothing now and I feel I won't have anything in the future. It's really hard to be on campus and see all the interactions students have with each other while I'm alone. I am better than I was but I'm not good enough,  not even close enough to being want to be. Everyone around me are starting their lives and I feel like I'm sitting still. I gave tried making schedules but I never block out enough time and I wake up on  time,  but I cannot get out of bed. I will challenge myself this week However and start making small goals.  I don't have low sugar and I get enough sleep.  I really don't want to take antidepressants due to no insurance and it would freak my mom out.  I will also take work at the depression forums."

You're literally the only one who remembers those embarrassing moments in your past, because nobody else remembers.   It's generic advice, but it's really the only advice you need: be yourself, pursue things that genuinely interest you, and don't be concerned what others think of you because, in large part they don't think of you at all.

DecidingToBeBetter,30me8m,BananaPeddler,7,Sat Mar 28 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"I've been struggling with the same issues recently. It's a little funny to have the same perspective reversed and see someone else say a lot of the same things I say to myself. Maybe I can offer some advice.  I guess the first thing I'll say is that the past can't be changed. You spent your youth how you did and you are where you are now. This can't be altered now. But that's okay. Think of it this way - how your teens have been spent has led you to the point now that you care about how you spend the rest of your life. You want to effect change in your life. That's significant. Many people find their comfortable niche and sit there because they never mustered the energy to get out of it or didn't feel a desire to raise their standards. As long as this fire is lit underneath you, you won't end up that way. It's gonna be painful from time to time, but you'll quickly learn that it's unrealistic to expect otherwise. And it'll be worth it.  Moreover, figuring out how the world works and where you fit into it IS the journey of life. Everyone is in your boat, whether you or they realize it. The only difference is they either happened to find themselves in circumstances that forced them to learn quickly (perhaps their parents couldn't pay for college, so they were forced to learn the work ethic the hard way to carry themselves through while picking up a job, as just one example). Or maybe they haven't quite ""woken up"" yet and don't have the same existential crisis you do just yet. The bottom line is that the thing you're afraid of diving into - pursuing the unknown and learning ""what it's all about"" - creates the drama that will turn into the stories you tell your children. It's scary, but running from it is the last thing you wanna do!  /u/BananaPeddler is totally right about folks thinking about you only 10% of the time, and probably only an other 10% of that thought is dedicated to your blunders. Embarrassment serves a significant purpose. You never forget those moments so you don't make the same mistake again. But the intensity of those feelings can be overwhelming to the point of hindering you from taking chances again, and that response is certainly disproportionate to how much thought others give the same events. Master those feelings. Use them. Learn from them. But don't become handicapped by them. You'll be unstoppable if you can allow yourself to find out how.  /u/Schlickbart is right, too. Cut yourself some slack. You only have a reason to be upset with yourself if you choose to cling to the past but don't learn from it. What's past is past. Let it be!  Hope this is of help!"
DecidingToBeBetter,30me8m,RabidNapkin,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:43:49 2015 UTC,My parents didn't really pay for my college but they did do a lot for me growing up and they treated me too nicely and didn't discipline me at all. Everyone thats ever been succesful were never spoilt pricks. They all had hard lifes from a young age and that set the tone for the rest of their lives. I was doomed from the day my parents spoilt me.
DecidingToBeBetter,30me8m,araesk,3,Sun Mar 29 14:11:53 2015 UTC,"Who are you to not be spoiled? Why are you entitled to a better life when all you is dream about it while blaming everything else for doing bad things to you - everything but yourself?  Nobody owes you anything. You want something? Get up from your couch and do what it takes to get it. Nobody will bring it to you, and you succumbing to wishful thinking will only further this illusion.  Your problem is not that your parents made you weak - it's that you're not willing to make yourself strong. It's easy to blame parents for doing no good for you, but it's a path of the weak, it's only a defence - one of many - to justify world treating you not the way you wish it to, when the truth is - world treats you no different than it treats the next guy who makes millions by the age of 25.  The difference between you and him is that he doesn't believe in any duty of the world or his surroundings to him - instead, he seizes opportunities that arise because he knows: work will grant achievement, not wish. There's no self to take pride in, or to protect, or to give constant joy to: there're goals, wants to feed and methods to achieve both of those.  Don't get me wrong: it's not this abstract and evil self that's your enemy - you are causing your trouble, and nobody else. You have no excuse not to do what you want to do, and whatever comes to mind is an excuse you make up to defend yourself, as if you're made of glass. There's nothing to defend: whatever you find worthy of such an act is ephemeral and of no use to anybody.  You're afraid because you want it all to be perfect. Well, guess what: nothing is ever perfect, and you'll break your neck faster than you achieve perfection in everything you do. The only person who's not making mistakes is the one not trying to do anything. You will make mistakes, but those won't be yours. They just happen, especially when one's dealing with stuff they know nothing about.  So, maybe I'm not saying those perfect words that will suddenly change your mind and make you a better person. Maybe there are no such words. Well, fuck that: I'm gonna say what I want to say anyway, because you're worth trying, and there's nothing that will make me stop helping others, because people deserve help from those who can help.  TL;DR: Fuck you. Now, do what you see as best."

You have to understand that you are the master of your own fate (corny I know, but its true). When you wake up in the morning, its either you can decide to turn a new page in your life and say you CAN do this, instead of you can't. I used to be depressed that I wasn't a social person and getting upset that o wasn't able to talk to people or be as socially involved as the majority of the rest; but you know what, I started working at it. Every day. And as long as you keep working, and working, and working, you'll come a very long way relatively fast.   I implore you for this next day, instead of having a negative attitude at things, try looking at the bright side. Instead of asking yourself ""What if I can't do this?""

I went to university for engineering from 19-24. I didn't love it and wasn't great at it. I worked an office job in a different field for a couple years that I also found didn't like. I backpacked around Asia for half a year after quitting my job which was awesome. While travelling I decided to pursue a different, more ambitious career path so I'm back in University as a mature student. I'm very passionate about what I do now so I don't mind going back to school from age 27-34. Also I'm in my peak years because I'm smarter than all the younger students in my program and I'm physically stronger now than I was in my 20s.  Yes studying does set you up for a better life later, if you're in a program that facinates you. But that doesn't mean you can't be enjoying your life in the meantime. In fact, it's the best time to learn, grow, and try new things if you explore your possibilities and manage your time well. It still beats working at the same desk all day every day."

Empathetic listening means putting yourself in the speaker's place and trying to understand how they feel.

Now in college I learned that when I'm really stressed, I stop eating. Not a eating disorder because I'm not self conscious about my weight and I love food.

At 27, I still feel as though I'm on autopilot. Motivation seems hopeless, almost laughable, because each time I was motivated before, each time I had drive, focus, intensity, passion, and an ounce of momentum, it faded away overnight. It's as though all of those positive feelings were a daydream, a quick respite from the depression that is reality.   Whew, got myself worked up thinking about it.

One of the most frustrating aspects about being aware of my state of mind in the current moment, what is going on right now, is the feeling that I can't quite latch onto anything.  Fleeting motivation and random bursts of focus and drive generally come along with that flair of elation or sometimes less frequently, euphoria.  It feels so raw and primal, and I've come to regard it as a manic state.  And I expect that this feeling will crest, unconsciously while it seems I'm always distracted and not always able to focus on the ""coming down"" part. Rapid cycles within larger fluctuations.  Again and again.  At nearly 22, I really am just scratching the surface of a more mature interpretation of what you must experience every day, and it makes me fucking scared of what a 27 year old me could look like.  That's almost as long from now as when I started university when I was 18, which seemed like yesterday.  Taking into consideration that my fathers side of my family must be genetically vulnerable to depression (my dad's mother has lived with it for as long as I can remember, as well as my dad currently and his sister in the past), it seems I'm inherently following that pattern.

I think the first step for you is going to see a professional who can answer your concerns about various mental illnesses and help you find a starting point for improvement. Finding the right therapist is hard and it will likely take a few tries to find some one you mesh with. The fact that you want things to get better is a wonderful thing so don't lose that desire.   Something that usually helps me with anxiety/depression is spending 5 minutes exercising, 5 minutes stretching, and 5 minutes sitting outside not thinking about anything that stresses me out. I try to do that everyday, and I have the 5 minute minimum because it is a small enough task to manage even when I feel bad and makes me feel productive on days when I can't do much.  I think it's great you are reaching out for help, it's one of the hardest things to do and I hope things work out for you."

You haven't replied to anyone telling you to go talk to a therapist/psychiatrist. You've diagnosed yourself with several significant conditions, but you haven't (or haven't mentioned it) spoken to a professional.  This isn't a problem you're going to solve by browsing the internet really well. This is a problem that you will solve in real life, with real people helping you, or not at all. Sometimes you need someone to call you on your shit and tell you 'no'. I didn't find someone like that until way too late, in fact, I've been missing someone like that lately and my mental health took a massive dive.   Go see a therapist. You don't have to stick with it, you don't have to make any commitments, just go one time and see what it's like. If you're anything like me you have a boatload of excuses, you justify all your actions in retrospect to make them seem reasonable instead of just lazy, and you need a kick in the ass to get out of the house and change things.  You need to stop thinking so much. Are you skinny? Eat more. Right now, go eat a sandwich. If you don't, it's because you're lazy and you're comfortable with this rut. You are the one deciding to write out long posts on an internet forum instead of eating a sandwich. You are the one who is refusing to talk to a therapist when the whole purpose of their existence is to help people like you. You are the one who doesn't get proper sleep, who pretends they're fine to their loved ones, who wastes hours and hours doing nothing and then spends the rest of his time feeling guilty about it.   You don't need any more internet help. You need to eat a sandwich and see a therapist. You need to take a walk and appreciate the outdoors. You're malnourished, it's as simple as that. Eat more food, shove it into your mouth and chew it up. It is nothing but fuel, and you've been starving your body of it.   I'm sorry if I'm unreasonably harsh or if I did make too many assumptions. I just think you need a kick in the ass. Talk about this with someone who cares about you, it will feel so good to let it out.  And seriously man, every single one of your problems is a symptom of improper diet. Eat more man."
DecidingToBeBetter,30kd45,eastcoastk,4,Sat Mar 28 07:36:27 2015 UTC,You're absolutely right and it's easy to make excuses. The only person accountable for me is myself.  A kick in the ass is the kind of thing that would make me shake the irrational perceptions that are justifying my laziness.  It's resoundingly apparent that it's time to talk to someone about it.

Hey, I have some similar issues as you - rotating between feeling on top of the world and feeling absolutely down in the dumps. Something I started doing that I think helps is I'll make an audio recording on my phone on the days I'm feeling good. And I often will even note in the recording, ""I feel great now. It's important for me to remember that I won't always feel this way, but I have this as veritable proof that I can feel good and be good"". See, because when I get in those low states - I get this hopeless feeling like things will never be ok, and that this sad person is my TRUE self, and those other times are me just faking it. And that's really just not true - I'm just really good at tearing my self down when I'm feeling low. Playing an audio recording of myself that's explaining how I get low like that, but that it's temporary and that I can also be that other guy I'm listening to - it helps me. I know the whole process might sound kinda weird, but it's been helping me."

I am your constant companion,  I am your greatest helper or your heaviest burden.  I will push you onward or drag you down to failure.  I am at your command.  Half of the tasks that you do you might just as well  turn over to me and I will do them quickly  and correctly  I am easily managed,  you must merely be firm with me.  Show me exactly how you want something done;  after a few lessons I will do it automatically.  I am the servant of all great people and  alas of all the failures as well.  Those who are great I have made great,  those who are failures I have made failures.  I am not a machine, but I work with all the precision  of a machine, plus the intelligence of a person.  Now you may run me for profit  or you may run me for ruin.  It makes no difference to me.  Take me, train me, be firm with me,  and I will lay the world at your feet.  Be easy with me and I will destroy you.  Who am I? I am called Habit."
DecidingToBeBetter,30kd45,jet_silver,3,Sat Mar 28 16:27:29 2015 UTC,"You know what? Feeling bad is fine. We all feel bad from time to time, for as long or longer and in as big or bigger amplitudes as you. Bad things happen, and you feeling bad about them is the normal way to process them: that's how you know there are things to change.  So, your best thing to do right now is to accept what you feel as fine. It may not be good, pleasant, interesting or attractive to feel, but it's fine, because right now, there's nothing you can be other than you.  Stepping forth with this processed idea and deciding to actually do something - ask for help, for example - is a good thing, but it's not the only thing you have to do. I'm not bipolar, but I understand how mood swings can affect your life, both in lifelong and day-to-day terms. I've had days when I want to do this and that, and I start planning for this cool thing to achieve and that one thing I've been willing to do for so long!.. only to find out the next day that I don't have enough mental strength to do all of it - sometimes I even think that I won't ever get it accomplished.  And you know what? It's fine. That's what I feel, therefore that's what I feel. It may sound simple to the point of stupidity, but I've noticed that exactly such simple things we tend to overlook when thinking of ourselves. We want to think of ourselves as all-powerful, mighty creatures of natures, but in reality, we often scramble to make day-to-day count for something. And it's fine: that's what we are.  I've learned that grand ideas, whenever they come, are not good unless there's either a clear and reasonably hard path to do it or a big incentive. The former means that you know how to do it and can spare enough resources to it - time, money, effort, food, willpower, so on - to not harm the important tasks of your life - eating, sleeping, socials, self-expression and the ultimate goals or conditions that make you feel like they're worth doing (for me, first of all, it's writing: I've always felt like that's the only thing I'll keep doing even when broke and broken, because I greatly enjoy envisioning stories and telling them to others; then there are a loving family with kids, independence and self-reliance). The latter means that you can gain great increment towards any of your ultimate goals or conditions or basics of living (all listed above): exercising all day every day for a month might be tough on you, but if your goal is to be strong, mentally and physically, then it's worth doing, as it will give you the strength if done right.  Same goes for the little things you do. I'm highly sensitive - apparently, one of this kind of people - which, basically, means I notice more than a normal person. I can tell you that many things you'd dismiss can either show you what you really feel or change how you feel after doing it. It's not a reason to be obsessed over it - obsession is just another kind of fear, and it seems that you have enough reasons to feel emotionally pressed already - but you might want to look into what you really feel and work with it. Maybe there's something inside of you you're not seeing; I'm not saying there is, but experience tells me we miss a lot of our own thoughts and feelings. It's called introspection.  You want to find support groups and people that will help you go through with it, as well. Support is very important when you're going through hard times, as you seem to do right now. Support groups are led by people who've been there or those in the know of what you have to do, so they're your best chance.  Before I say the last thing, I must note that I'm not an expert. I urge you to contact proper medical authorities in order to test the theory before trying it on yourself, as it might have unforeseen undesirable consequences.  So, one last thing I'd advise you to do: eat not how much you want, but how much you need from the perspective of normal calories intake (you'd have to research that on your own, but I'm sure Reddit can help you out with info sources). Since you have to eat more than you have to to feel better, treat it as exercise: you may not do it, but you will feel worse if you don't; I'm sure you don't want that, so go ahead and stick in a bit more than your body tells you to. Again, I'm no expert, so don't take my word for it.  Good luck, my friend. Have faith: you're stronger than you think."

On the topic of introspection, I feel this is an incredibly valuable trait.  I would regard myself as highly introverted, introspection and reflection are two innate traits that I have come to realize are part of who I am.  Spending a lot of time alone is allows for an amazing feeling of freedom I find, and by the same logic, depression and anxiety can be incredibly crippling and demoralizing for such people.  You make some excellent points.  On the topic of daily caloric needs, which I probably fail to hit some days, this is absolutely an area of primary concern.  After so many years of having a poor appetite, poor eating habits have gone uninhibited and probably compounded into a problem as destructive as any eating disorder.  Treating this fundamental part of my lifestyle may likely require some form of CBT to make lasting habitual change, but dealing with this particular area would be an excellent source of momentum that would undoubtedly bring immediate benefits in every other facet of my life.  Thank you."

Do never tell yourself that you can't do it before you've even tried: how do you know otherwise? You want to get healthy, not comfy, and that requires stading by your standards no matter how hard it is. It's a challenge, but it's one worth spending day's worth of willpower to.  While you're on the high wave, make arrangements. Print out daily intake numbers, start a log book (preferably one on the wall furthest from your computer or your bed) and stick to it. You already know how important it is for you. Remind yourself of what happened when you didn't eat properly and run away scared from the fucking thing like it's black plague: eat, jog, push up, whatever it is that makes you even a fraction of a tiny bit of a better person.  Small victories, my friend. You won't build your Rome in a day, but you might as well start today."
DecidingToBeBetter,30kd45,Zackcid,1 point,Sat Mar 28 06:55:45 2015 UTC,"Highly sensitive person:       A highly sensitive person (HSP) is a person having the innate trait of high sensory processing sensitivity (or innate sensitiveness as Carl Jung originally coined it  ). Some common signs are sensitivity to loud noises, bright or fluorescent lights, and strong smells. HSP's often describe themselves as having a rich and complex inner life. They may startle easily and get rattled when required to accomplish a lot in a short time. According to Elaine N. Aron and colleagues as well as other researchers, highly sensitive people, who compose about a fifth of the population (equal numbers in men and women), may process sensory data much more deeply and thoroughly due to a biological difference in their nervous systems.  This is a specific trait, with key consequences for how we view people, that in the past has often been confused with innate shyness, social anxiety problems, inhibitedness, social phobia and innate fearfulness,   and introversion.  The trait is measured using the HSP Scale, which has been demonstrated to have both internal and external validity.  Although the term is primarily used to describe humans, something similar to the trait is present in over 100 other species.

""At the end of the day, I answer to the unforgiving Bastard who watches me shave"" has become something of a mantra.

For instance: My new boss asked me to lie on a compliance report and I had to explain to him that there's nothing he could possibly do to make me comply with that request.   It was hard won, but truly sailing by my own compass is wonderfully freeing. It starts out being a lot harder than giving yourself over to what other people want/expect of you.

If there's something I'm dreading, worrying about how hard it'll be or how long it'll take, I start doing it and tell myself I just have to work on it for five minutes for real, and then if I feel like stopping I can. I almost never stop right after that. It's such a small unit of time I can't say no, and usually once I've started I see it's not so bad and I'd rather just finish then have to keep worrying about it.  That's another thing: I can tell myself ""If I finish doing X then I won't have to worry about it anymore."" Think about something like playing video games instead of doing homework you need to do. Playing video games is fun, but having that work looming over you kinda spoils it. Get it done and then you don't have that to worry about."

If its weight loss, never bring junk food into the house, make yourself go out specifically to get it and finish it. If its getting more work or studying done set up a clean desk space without electronic distractions, set up a time lock on your internet. If its being more creative, focus on bringing visuals and sounds to your space that inspire you. Its hard to stay motivated or even disciplined its a constant drain on your mind, so by removing the need to make as many choices and having an environment that is friendly to your goals you increase the likelihood of being motivated and cultivating good habits.

I remember this long post   After maybe 5 or 6 months I noticed that my mind was getting quieter. I used to talk in my head A LOT but that had diminished - and would continue to diminish over the months.   I had a very similar experience to what this guy was talking about.  I'd have this unmanageable negative self-talk but that faded away after daily meditation and I've had an unimaginably better time since. For example, when I'd walk to class I'd have so much self-conscious doubt about my appearance even though I knew I shouldn't but I just could not stop it. After meditation, these thoughts sometimes pop up but I somehow don't pay attention to them and they pass really quickly.   Also, I used to have those dips you're talking about. I'd call them ""low-points"" because after while I caught on that they'd just happening. Well those low-points still happen, and will continue to happen because perfection is a lost cause, but honestly they don't even last more than a few hours. They used to last days or even weeks. I suggest you look into it. I do the one where you focus on breathing, btw."

DecidingToBeBetter,30du2h,MUSXBEST,2,Sat Mar 28 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"This can be so difficult, though. It's so easy to believe that you'd do this until you're actually faced with being the one who helps them up the hill for a prolonged period of time.  I have a friend, someone who I knew since childhood. It's a very long story, so just have faith when I say that things went horrible for him. The roots to it all go back to even his own birth, but they surfaced with our drug use as teenagers, followed by his drug dealing, ending in his mental illness. Of course, the problems are still ongoing, but he has adapted to live with his condition over these past couple years.  When we found out he was ill, that he was psychotic, I was there to help him because that's what my job was. And it was easy because I had to do it, I had no choice. I stuck by him through the drugs, and the dealing, but this was the only time I ever needed to help him, during his illness. And that was in the form of being someone to talk to, and it turned out that I did a pretty good job of it. I could talk to him when his head was bad, and he and I could talk for hours, we spent every other evening for a few months together just talking and trying to put things straight in his mind, or even just relaxing and doing normal stuff, bringing normality to life, playing video games and stuff like we used to. Being childhood friends, people who shared everything with most of their lives, and as someone who had experienced to a much lesser degree the degradation of mental health which drugs can cause, I was someone who could help him in a large way.  But I couldn't do this for ever. I helped him out of the worst of it, to be sure. I helped him out of that rain cloud at the bottom. But halfway up the hill, certain relapses occured. He went back to drugs. I stuck with him but I wasn't there as much as I was. His psychosis was subsiding, but he was still not very far up the hill, and the drugs were like a huge boulder in the way of him climbing it. And I can't move a boulder.  A little later on, the dealing came back. Only for a short while, but this made the ground slippy. He was doomed to end up under the rain before long. Luckily, however, he had learnt from what it did to him before, and it didn't take long for him to stop. It was just a phase. I think he missed it.  Eventually, he became drug free and was more co operative with his psychosis and how it now affected his life, and how he needed to live around it. And he has been for a while now, and is making his own way up the hill. I haven't had much to do with his progression for the rest of it. He has other friends who are in the same boat as he is, and they're all pulling together to do it.  I was just exhausted from getting him out from under the cloud. It's hard to see down there, and the ground is just so wet and slippy. You just get nowhere fast. 20 years old and trying to turn the tables on a friend heavily at the mercy to the voices inside his head. I'm proud of what we achieved together, though. But once he got his leg up and got out of the rain, I did back off on the help. I was mentally exhausted. And Jesus, I can't begin to imagine how he felt.  The story has a happier ending than what I expected during the outbreak of it all, though. His psychosis is far less intense, and comes in shorter periods, these days. He has a job, he's training, he and his friends are still solid, and his relationship with his family has improved greatly. And when I see him these days, I rarely see him in anything close to the states which he used to be in.  The point is, don't beat yourself up if you can't get a person from zero to hero, because it'd take a damn hero to do that. And we aren't all that strong. I'm sure we'd like to think that we are, and shit it's good to try to be one, but if you get to a point where you don't have it in you to take them the rest of the way, that's okay. The hard part is that damn rain cloud at the bottom, and as far as helping people goes, that's the most valuable thing that you can do, getting them just out of the rain and up onto the hill."

This is a huge move - don't ever discount yourself for taking this awesome step in the right direction for you. My best advice for you? Get up 10 minutes (or maybe five- or even two minutes!) [That's 182.5 hours annually on working on yourself and your development.] early and reflect upon what you want to accomplish. Take 10 minutes at the end of the day to reflect on what you want to accomplish. And take another 10 thinking about what you've learned about yourself. Accept what choice you made - good or bad - and commit to doing better the next day. If at the end of the day you didn't do everything you wished, acknowledge and accept that and do better the next day. Forgive yourself and don't drag the guilt around. You will find that right now everyone wishes you well, but parts of your journey will be scary and lonely. Also - when you are seeing the fruits of your success - the nay sayers will chime in and say you are doing things wrong or whatever. IGNORE THE NAY SAYERS. They aren't your friends (even though they may appear to be). A saying I think about a lot in my life and my business is essentially ""Don't be afraid to rock the boat. They aren't your friends anyway."" Life is kind of a custom product and you are the ""customizer."" The rewards are awesome but the journey require work.

DecidingToBeBetter,30gpnd,masmasalfamidi,3,Mon Mar 30 02:41:09 2015 UTC,"This is great. I know that it can often be an uphill battle when making major life changes. It's confusing to know what to do, it's difficult to change your habits, and it's all too easy to slip back into what you're comfortable with. But at least you can recognize that you want to change. That's absolutely huge. Most people don't even make it to where you're at.  I think the most important idea to internalize is that you must live true to yourself. It's surprisingly hard to do. We often let other people dictate how we live our lives. It's easy to get swept up into what other people want for us because it takes effort and responsibility away from us, it's less of a challenge. But real fulfillment is out there if you simply make that switch in your brain... you're gonna live for yourself. You deserve it.  So take this new inspiration you're feeling and run with it. Little strides every day. There will be failures, so don't beat yourself up over them. Accept them, acknowledge them, and move on. Keep trying and keep growing. You got this."

I had my account from the very beginning of Facebook, back when you had to have a .edu e-mail address to even sign up!  For the first few days, I kept typing in the address and hitting enter before I remembered.    I have more free time now, which means that while I'm at work, I can get more actual work done, and while I'm at home, I have more time for the important things.  I downloaded and set up an account with a messenger that I read good reviews on called Telegram.  I use that to communicate with my wife and mom during the day (we used to use FB messenger), and I like it!  I don't find myself constantly checking it, and when I do go to look at the new messages when they pop up, there isn't the temptation like with Facebook to ""catch up"" on everything that has happened since I last checked, so it's not a time drain.  I also posted once a day for the last week to let everyone know I was deleting my account, and made sure to include my e-mail, phone number, and account information for Telegram.  Sadly, I only heard from 5 people, so I guess that just reinforced my decision to delete my account!  I've thought also about deleting my account here, but I don't check it as compulsively as I used to check Facebook, and there aren't as many posts to catch up with when I do check, so it only takes a few minutes each time, so I think I'll keep it for the time being. :)"

The ones I hang out with and care about are on my whatsapp. So yeah, facebook was useless to me, but I still kept checking it all the time.   When I deleted it, I ended up doing other useless shit like stalking sports forums and looking at pictures of cats - I was still bored and needed something to fill the holes in my day, facebook was just one of the several ways I could do it.  I wouldn't advise deleting it, just finding something better to spend your time on - me, I've gotten myself addicted to fitness and investment sites and it's helping me a lot. And while 90% of facebook is full of crap, the remaining 10% can be very useful - such as getting in touch with friends when travelling to their cities and reconnecting with people I'd fallen out of touch with.

It's also a magnet for attention seekers, posting stupid statuses that seek attention from others. I quit FB a while ago and my life is much better without it. I frequent Twitter personally and get more engaging conversations from the complete strangers who follow me and that I follow back. Good luck ditching FB"

Self control, moderation, and identifying the values it actually brings is a better course than escapism. My two cents."

We can't escape preconceptions, even if the most scientific and rational ones. We project our prior knowledge when trying to make sense of the body of data around us.

Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.” - Calvin Coolidge  “You go on. You set one foot in front of the other, and if a thin voice cries out, somewhere behind you, you pretend not to hear, and keep going.” - Geraldine Brooks  I struggle with some similar feelings. I too have a project that I am passionate about, but can't always seem to get comfortable starting on. I'm in a similar boat, but what has helped me make progress is to not view the project as such a major undertaking. Regular people did very large things, but not over night. Take small steps to build what you want.  Imagine if each day you grabbed a rock while you were out somewhere, and tossed it into a pile by your door. Each day the rock you collected was a different size, but no matter what, you made an effort to grab one and add it to the pile. Over time the pile of rocks grows bigger and bigger, and before you know it your pile of rocks turns into a hill, and then a mountain. This is what persistence is all about. But, to add, it's not all about being persistent. Nothing in this world comes without hard work. You get what you give, or ""you reap what you sow"".   It's about hard work and persistence.  “Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.” - Robert Collier  “If you can’t fly then run, if you can’t run then walk, if you can’t walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” -Martin Luther King Jr.  You've made some great progress in other places, so just apply those same qualities that got you healthy and establishing good habits to your work ethic on the project. When in doubt, ignore the thin voice, and Press On!"

I want to become an educated, self-sustaining person (and maybe a musician on the side), but I never seem to take the steps to make those dreams a reality. I easily side track to what makes me comfortable and give up easily.  I can't even say I've ever been successful in forming any good habit as you have, so naturally, I feel less confidence than you might in that area. But then again, what I lack in self development and academia, I make up for somehow at my jobs, having a reputation at most of my work places of giving 120% to everyone.  I don't have much faith in myself, based on my skeptical, unencouraged, and ridiculing upbringing. However, evidence does alot for me. Were it not for my success at my jobs, I'd probably have given up on myself years ago on trying to make a somebody out of myself. I'm trying to find out the correlation between my drives at my jobs to my drives on myself and my schooling. I'm trying to discover more about myself and how I work and I feel that that's my journey to success/adulthood. You've clearly had success so that is clear evidence that you can also figure this out too.  I don't have the answer yet, but that's why I'm coming here: So I can get some wisdom, knowledge, or support on the matter. Like Swullivan is saying, however you go about it, don't give up. I don't think I'm terribly smart, but once I put my mind to something, somehow I find a way. It should be the same with our situations. If we keep banging our heads (figuratively) trying to find the solution enough, it'll all click eventually, I think. Just be persistant."

DecidingToBeBetter,30et3m,dementiapatient567,2,Thu Mar 26 20:07:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't give you answers on how to achieve your goal, but I can share a process that's helped me figure out where to go:  Start with your end goal.  Ask yourself what you would need to do that.  The answer to the second question becomes the new goal. Repeat step two, again and again until you reach something actionable.  Next, figure out who can help you. People can help in many ways, whether it's emotional support, by teaching you a skill you need, or give you information to achieve a goal.   If you know what you need to do, but don't know how to do it, ask. If you don't know who to ask, go ask someone who you'd think would reasonably know. And if they don't know, ask them if they know who would know. Keep going and going until you get there.  The great thing with this process, for me at least, is that it breaks everything down into the smallest bits of the puzzle; small actionable things that you can do. I mean, you may not be able to walk up to a big research company and get a job as a researcher right now, but you can at least make a few phone calls asking people what you need to do, and who you need to talk to."

DecidingToBeBetter,30brm8,mavrc,23,Thu Mar 26 03:53:48 2015 UTC,"I went back to school in my late 20s/early 30s. Now I teach. Here's my list:   Make lists. I use a calendar, so that I get list plus dates and times. This is the only thing that keeps me organized. I use a combination of Google Calendar and Wunderlist, but the most important part is that you pick something and stick with it. Start assigned work early - as early as you can. My #1 problem with students is the ""due tomorrow, do tomorrow"" idea. This is great if you're that annoying smartass that can rip out an assignment in an evening with no hesistation. But if that isn't you (it wasn't me, and it isn't most students) you'll fail assignments because you don't have time to ask anybody questions. Which leads me to: If you get stuck, please, please don't stay stuck. Find out what your profs' office hours are and be there. If your professor is uncooperative, ask other people in the department. Set up study groups with peers. Ask around a lot. Find out if there are any study resources provided by your department or school. Expect that some things will be rusty and you'll need to take some time with them (typically math.)  Expect that you'll be frustrated with the speed at which your younger peers blow through their work. If you're not getting run down by the work, read/work ahead if you can. This will help you later. You will have frustrated angry nights when you want to just flip the table and bail out, and if you're ahead a bit, when you decide to blow off all your work for a night and just drink beer and watch TV (which will probably happen to you - it happens to everybody) it won't tank your grades.   Building good work habits is difficult. It requires both willpower and self-trickery. I'd love to say I'm an authority on this, but I'm posting this on Reddit when I should be working."

Get used to having an up-to-date calendar, as well as a to-do list.  I have my lists categorized by project...so I have a thesis to-do, a practicum to-do, etc, then I pull from them to set out my day.  Know that all of your projects and assignments and duties are on the lists and in the calendar, and then check them frequently.  I'm a former procrastinator, and those things have worked for me.  I use a modified ""Getting Things Done"" approach (Google it if you don't know what it is.)  Also, since it's been a while for you, grab a used textbook that you'll be reading next year and jump into it now.  It takes a bit of time to get used to reading academic stuff again.

Use Khan academy and other online videos to reinforce concepts. Do your homework and all assignments as soon as they become available, be it online or something you do on your own. Due dates are absolute maximum lateness. Rent your books. I use Chegg. Also check Craigslist to see if anyone's selling them locally for cheap. Ebay, too. Stay at school after class. Go directly to the computer lab. Finish all assignments before you go home. Get good sleep. Get up extra early in the morning, like 4 hours before class. Work out, shower, make breakfast, get dressed, organize your backpack, pack a lunch, leave 15 minutes earlier than you need to for school. My absolute best days start out this way. Set a schedule. As a student, school is your priority. Not Netflix or video games. All that shit will be there to watch or play later when you've accomplished your goals. I work in shifts.

Finished my Biology chapter reading and studied my notes for an hour? 30-minute break to ride my bike up to the gas station for a Coke. etc. Set timers and limits and stick to them.

Will they mistake me for the professor? Yes. That might happen if you go to a popular university, but fuck it.

If you're in a community college, you'll be surrounded by lots of people your age. Don't worry about the age, it's not a big deal.  As far as worrying about not getting through, you just show up. Show up the first day, then show up the second day. You'll eventually find yourself at the end of the semester. The difference in your maturity now will lend itself to having better study habits.   Last I'll tell you this, get a degree with some kind of vocational skill or qualification behind it.

Don't let this age difference get to you, though - find people in your classes with similar goals and values (i.e. not the ones there to party) and become friends with them.  Don't let feeling 'too old' stop you from socializing with your peers.  It's important to be able to motivate yourself to work, but it is also important to be in an atmosphere where your accomplishments are supported and you are encouraged to apply yourself.  It also doesn't hurt to throw in a friendly competition aspect, where you maybe see who can finish the assignment earliest while still getting the best mark, etc."

While it's nice to be able to make your schedule flexible, school will overflow its boundaries if you let it. As a guideline, you should spend two hours working outside of class for every hour you spend in class. Some classes will require more time than this. Some you can get away with less, but try not to. And try to schedule yourself one day every week to not think about school: no homework, no textbooks, etc. Just do some housework, go for a hike, whatever.

At 21 I took 2 semesters of 18 credit hours while working full time and got onto the Dean's list.  The same happened at 24, went back and got onto the dean's list and consistently scored over 100% on final exams.  Now I have over 100 credit hours and returning this fall.   It's taken me this long because I moved 4 times switching schools twice, I've opted for a lot of international traveling instead, and I was an alcoholic.    I'm finally ready to knock this undergrad shit out of the park.  Grades are only about hard work.  I read everything and put the time into studying and accomplishing my requirements and my discipline grows as I age.  last time I was in school I remember feeling sorry for some of the freshmen who I knew just weren't fully applying themselves.  They looked up to me like I was a genius because I was just under a 4.0 at 18 hours while working and taking the bus, but I was just more dedicated to doing what had to be done.  if I could do it all again, i wouldn't have even started college until 22-25.  And the girls were great last time around.  I was much more successful in attracting the lot.  I had a 19 year old freshman get mad at me when I was 24 because I had not asked her out.  And I was also asked out by a 20 year old who I would have thought was out of my league when I was 18-20.

Everybody says it, nobody does it (except the kids who are killing this college thing). I went to talk to my teacher after my first test; I made a 72 and I really needed an A in the course. She was not really hopeful that I could pull an A out, but gave me some great advice about study groups. I took her advice, and I absolutely got that A!  I'm also a procrastinator, so I'm coming from the same place, mentally. Truly, what helped me is study groups. I held them at my house, and I could NOT have these people over just to teach me! The scheduled study date meant that I had to study before hand so my guests didn't feel like they were coming over for my benefit. In the end, we all did really well.  Be social! If you don't feel like hosting study groups, at least ask others what they do to make their good grades. Somebody will have a gem that totally helps you get ahead!"

The only way to travel without feeling like a tourist is to travel to the same place multiple times. Even then, locals won't accept you as anything other than a tourist. Part of why travel is so great is going somewhere, feeling out of place, and then getting over that hump. Not caring is a great feeling.  EDIT: Also, you'll just need to get over negative experiences as a child. You know who else had negative experiences as a kid? Everyone. Everyone had bad experiences when they were younger.

Research your destinations in advance to get more familiar with the layout, points of interest, etc... Google earth is great for this.  But don't be afraid to get lost. Some of my best travel experiences have come from aimless exploring.  Don't feel like you have to cram in every photo-op and tourist trap. Take time to go to a park, coffee shop, museum, or what ever you might also enjoy at home. Then relax, sit back and watch the city and its people. Its a great feeling when you escape the postcard and gain a feel for the personality of a city/location.

Use it as a conversation opener,  ask them what theyre doing, why they're doing it, learn about them and interact. Dont use your map to follow a strict itinerary.

Get together three or four close friends (make sure they aren't complainers) and go somewhere new with them. Take a short trip, maybe two days to start. One or two good traveling experiences will totally switch around your attitude towards them."

The journey is fun - just did a road trip through Slovenia, decided we would dip into Italy, and ended up in Venice.

I've gotten to know many cool people, and also visited many places I would never have thought of seeing. Couchsurfing also helps me connect with other cultures better.

DecidingToBeBetter,308oxh,BeBuildHave,3,Wed Mar 25 12:54:17 2015 UTC,"I have a similar issue and have a couple ideas I'll share.  Can you start small? Maybe a half-day or day trip to check out some local things you've never seen. Then expand from there. Keep your focus on doing things you enjoy and finding joy in the new experience, which to some extent is a choice.  Can you engineer a trip - maybe just a short one at first - that excludes all the crap you hated about traveling as a kid? Bike or train instead of car. Hotel or couch surf instead of camp. That sort of thing.  Can you plan some travel around stuff you do enjoy? I've planned a couple long weekends around visiting different amusement parks, or participating in rec sporting events (paintball) in different parts of the country.  To some extent it may just be redefining what you think of as travel. It doesn't have to be long boring trips to destinations you don't care about with people you don't like. Make it whatever you want it to be. Make it something fun and easy and enjoyable for you. And if you simply don't want to travel, no big deal. Read about the world online for a while and if you come across something interesting, make a note that maybe you'd like to visit some day. Start keeping a list like that and eventually something may float to the top that you can't resist.  Just make it fun and enjoy the process :)"

DecidingToBeBetter,308oxh,psubold,2,Wed Mar 25 13:05:13 2015 UTC,"Travel can be so many different things, depending on what you enjoy doing. If you've had bad experiences in the past with family vacations, it will help to think of why they were bad. Was it the types of destinations, the mode of travel, or the people you were with (aka your family) that made the experience negative?  No one can tell you what will make for a great travel experience without knowing what you're really looking for. If it's an expansion of world view and personal growth you are looking for, I would recommend traveling to an international location with enough time so you can relax and enjoy yourself doing the things you love to do without feeling like you are in a big damn rush.  I recommend international travel because you will be exposed to different people from different cultures which is really what makes travel a unique, learning experience. As someone already suggested, if you are in the U.S. and don't feel ready to go international (it's really not that bad), go somewhere that's much different to where you live. (ie east vs west coast, rural vs urban, north vs south, mountains vs beach, etc)  As far as not feeling like a tourist, it's something that you can never completely avoid. You are a tourist. But I've found that going to places that don't have as much tourism is a great way to feel like a guest instead of a tourist. If you interact with locals in a heavily touristed area, you will be treated much differently than if you go somewhere people aren't used to seeing travelers. Usually in those places, they will be excited to have you and want you to have a great experience.  That said, my biggest general advice for travel is to learn to appreciate the journey itself and not worry too much about the destination. Also, try to be patient, open-minded, and without expectations. If you go somewhere with big expectations and can't think of anything but the destination, you are likely to get frustrated with the journey and probably disappointed with the destination.  Another tip for feeling less like a tourist is to find a way to spend quality time with local people. This could be as simple as doing what locals like to do and being outgoing enough to make friends (which is actually really easy to do because as a traveler you are someone unique and different and people usually want to know about you, why you came, and make sure you enjoy their home). Or you could try using couchsurfing.org to find like-minded people in your destination whom you could meet up with or even stay with if you are feeling ready for it. It sounds crazy at first, but I have been doing this for years and have had incredible experiences, though sometimes they can be weird.   Sorry for the long reply, I've been traveling for the last 2 years and am also very interested in personal growth, so I can assure that if you approach travel with the right mindset, you will learn and have a good time.  If you have any specific questions or you want to share more about what you're looking for from travel, let me know because I'd be glad to help."
DecidingToBeBetter,308oxh,Oberon_Swanson,2,Wed Mar 25 13:42:29 2015 UTC,"Look up traveling tips, like what to pack, what not to pack, best times to go to certain destinations, cheapest ways to travel, etc. If you just go without doing much planning ahead you're relying on a lot of luck to have a good experience. If you have a plan that allows for a lot of flexibility, it will be more fun. The place you want to visit might be closed. Your car might break down. The weather might be aggressively terrible. You might get food poisoning. You might find out you're allergic to something you've never come in contact with before. You should have contingency plans for things like that. Then once you have a bit more experience, you will need less time planning because you know what works for you.  One general principle I've found is that the more popular a destination is, the crappier it is to actually go there, unless it's something very physically big like the Grand Canyon or Disney World. Proper time management is one of the most important parts of making a vacation work--nobody likes waiting in line. So if you're at the Louvre maybe just skip trying to take a selfie in front of the Mona Lisa and instead enjoy all the other really awesome but less crowded stuff there."
DecidingToBeBetter,308oxh,gleisir,2,Wed Mar 25 14:00:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with this 100%. I'm lucky enough to travel fairly regularly and I've gotten into the habit of planning my trips very loosely when possible. I'm usually a person who likes to know certain things about the next 48 hours - stuff like where I'm sleeping and where my stuff is, and maybe a few ideas about things I'd like to get done in that time and a few places to eat or drink that look interesting that I might like to check out. Nothing too taxing, but just enough concrete that I feel comfortable going out and wandering without feeling totally at sea. I make it a point to include a lot of ""flex"" time, to check out something newly interesting, or have an impromptu meal, or to sit and have a cool drink or wander down a random street or three. To be honest, sometimes that does include waking up late, drifting to a local cafe/watering hole and just kind of hanging out, reading, chatting and drinking all day and skipping the touristy stuff.  It's so refreshing to have your time be your own, and to consciously make decisions about how to spend it which fit whatever you're feeling at the moment; it's a rare gift to most people. Time management, sure, but also time...enjoyment? Mindfulness? Something like that. For me, it's a big part of traveling, and something I really treasure.  On another note, I sometimes do something like Geoguessr or Google Street View of various places to get me excited to explore. Might be worth a shot!"

Has English speaking inhabitants who are very friendly, and..  well, it's just a beautiful place, to be honest.  I did a 5 week long backpacking tour of the country a couple years ago and it was amazing.  I ran into many other people who were backpacking through the country along the way - pretty easy to make friends that way and pick up tips on what to see next.  I use such trips to try to do things I've never done before - a long solo hike through the Southern Alps, bungyjumping, etc.  Out of all the places I've travelled to, New Zealand is probably what I'd recommend as the best starter destination."

As a kid, I was always really interested in Stonehenge. I just thought it was the coolest place. When the travel group in my high school announced a trip that included Stonehenge, I jumped on it. We did a 2-week tour of the British Isles and every minute of it was amazing. The next year, they went to Greece and Turkey, and then to London for a couple days (which I'd visited on the British Isles trip). Because I was so excited about certain locations on the tours (Stonehenge, the Parthenon, etc) it really set the tone for the whole experience.  So, my advice: find a place you're interested in. Something you think is really neat. For me, it was Stonehenge. I'm not sure what it might be for you. The Vatican? The Coliseum? The Parthenon? Maybe just a particular country. Maybe a particular landscape. Find one thing or place that you want to see in person, then plan a trip to go see it."

I talked about moving to Spain for two years, that was my life plan, when push came to shove I really wasn't sure if I was doing the right thing. Turns out I was doing everything wrong, it is quite difficult for Americans to live in the European Union, but I had already made it that far, so I decided not to give up.   Who knows... Maybe the same will work for you? If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. Happy to help."

Hostels are a low cost alternative that usually help you meet people, too. Basically, the best thing to do is find a free/cheap place to stay, meet people, and tag along on their adventures until you can make some of your own.  Travel for events like festivals, and you'll automatically have something in common with a ton of people who are also attending.  If you're going to a bigger city, check out the city subreddit, and try to see if anyone is available to meet up."

Find something small, something easy, that you can do RIGHT NOW. Build yourself up with small successes.  Maybe it's going outside for a short walk. Maybe it's just putting on sneakers. Maybe it's getting out of bed. However small your initial steps have to be, just do whatever you are capable of in any given moment. Use your victories to empower yourself to move forward."

How did you just start though? I find myself lacking motivation due to repetitive failures.   Great question! I set aside time for taking action and compared it to times I wasn't taking action.  I found action > inaction within myself and decided to keep moving forward with it.   Also, taking action means expending energy. If you find you don't have the energy for taking action, then I would address that. That could be something like altering your diet or addressing addictions like porn, alcohol, or drugs.  I was in your shoes though. You have to keep asking the question ""why?"" repeatedly until you get to the bottom of it!"

If you're born into a world that tells you you're a piece of shit and unacceptable from day one, you just accept that as the truth. There's no easy way to flick a switch and automatically believe you're worthy."
DecidingToBeBetter,3048cd,fallowmal,3,Wed Mar 25 17:42:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's pretty screwed up that people are taught to think that way, and no, changing such embedded thinking patterns can't just happen overnight. It takes some work, especially when we live in a culture largely oblivious to this idea.   It can be done, though. The idea may be unconventional, but it's certainly realistic and sensible. Ask yourself: What use does it do to you or anyone else to feel bad about yourself innately? Why not feel good about yourself largely for just being you? Why cause yourself unnecessary stress and self esteem problems when they don't have to be there? How does that help you or anyone, vs you accepting and embracing yourself and everyone else for just being human? Competition exists and is very natural but why take it personally and identify yourself with it? Why feel BAD about being inferior to others in some aspect(s), rather than consciously choosing whether or not you even want to be better or as good as them? Why have your own happiness, vitality, and zest for life depend on how you compare to others or arbitrary standards? I'd say zest, happiness, and energy are PRECURSORS to success and growth.   Simply questioning your beliefs in this way should help you realize that you can have a substantial amount of self esteem just for being alive. Developing yourself will definitely make you feel better about yourself and your life (mostly your life), but it's not imperative that you do so to embrace yourself and life itself, and see that nothing MUST happen except your own health and safety.   Yeah, I'd say if you want the good things in life you do need to be competitive (health, money, intelligence, personality, etc) to some degree, but it shouldn't be an exhausting pursuit with no end, and you shouldn't DEFINE yourself really by anything other than being a human and doing what YOU want to do. We've reached a point where you really can choose your battles, since competition isn't nearly as important from a survival perspective as it was millenia ago (especially if you live in a developed country). As for your personal value, yes titles, status, achievements, good habits, character traits, competencies, etc do contribute to it, and definitely make you even more valuable, but I see your intrinsic human value as contributing the majority of it (I see it as 75%).  Can you find decent, satisfying employment in something you naturally do well? Can you have fulfilling activities in your life that satisfy YOU (not your toxic expectation to define yourself by how you stand compared to others)? Can you have meaningful relationships with others? Can you live a healthy lifestyle that keeps your body young and vital? Well congratulations, you deserve to feel awesome (if you want to). Improve (if you want to), but otherwise live it up, express yourself, and explore. As said, you're already ""there."" Personal development is part of enjoying life, but it really is the PROCESS that's more important. If you're depending on any outcome anywhere in your life in order to feel long term, stable happiness (not the momentary high that comes with success), then you're really missing out on a lot. I'd say developing your traits and abilities builds confidence much more than self worth, which although tie strongly to one another, are slightly different. And if other people are skeptical of you for not relying too much on tangible aspects of your personality or external life for your happiness, it's because this idea is pretty abnormal. But I think it benefits everyone and is pretty natural when you think about it.  Other peoples' expectations to some degree will effect the choices you make and the opportunities you have, but I find that by first fully accepting myself and feeling great regardless of anything I think or do (because I will make mistakes sometimes), I naturally make healthier, better choices, aim higher, feel better, and have little to no insecurities getting in the way of my ambitions. In a way, I'm MORE competitive, and I feel like giving to other people.   Try noticing how you think about your self esteem, write down common thoughts, and question ones that seem unreasonable, especially negative ones. It takes persistence but over time I feel you can come to have this perspective, as can anybody who's dissatisfied with most people's screwed up views on self worth causing many to feel bad about themselves for no good reason.  I hope everyone finds whatever perspective works for them, but I'm confident that this one has something useful for anybody."

DecidingToBeBetter,3048cd,fallowmal,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:19:43 2015 UTC,"I accept other humans however they happen to be, but still think I'm fundamentally flawed. Technically, I am fundamentally flawed, because I don't have a ""normal"" brain structure. And, it shows.   I have learned to forget about other people's judgments, but I'm still not understanding how to see myself as someone to be esteemed. I have no materialistic inclinations, and I feel trapped in my current life. If I were to just decide to make myself happy, it would involve abandoning three young children. There's no way I'm going to ruin their lives just to ""find myself"". I innately believe they are more important than I am, because I also innately believe I was only born so they could be born. From that perspective, I have no reason to feel a need for a self, because I only exist to care for those three people. I guess I kind of think something like ""I'll be able to be a human once they grow up.""   On the one hand, I do what I can to find a sense of self within the confines of my life. On the other hand, it's not enough for me to feel ""right"".  I do an exercise where I write down negative thoughts, then find a neutral response and finally find a positive about it. This helps, to some degree. I journal all the time. I am constantly working to keep myself in the present and in a state of calm. I think I'll eventually be able to do this by default, but I'm not to that point yet.  Thanks for explaining this to me, I'm going to print it out to re-read a few times."

DecidingToBeBetter,3048cd,fallowmal,2,Fri Mar 27 12:15:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your perspective. I think this is something to strive for, though I can't really understand how to just all of a sudden ""love self unconditionally"". It doesn't stop other people from talking trash. (My negative feelings, for example, all come from things other people say to me. I figure if so many people can say these things, maybe they're true...)  How do you maintain the self-love while other people are still telling you you're worthless?"
DecidingToBeBetter,3048cd,Pongpianskul,2,Fri Mar 27 16:35:07 2015 UTC,"this is something to strive for   No it is not. If you're engaged in striving it means you are not satisfied with yourself as you are now and the only time you will ever have the chance to be satisfied with yourself is now - never in the future. If you set up “what should be” in opposition to “what is” you will derive very little enjoyment from “what is”. Additionally, you will never derive any enjoyment from “what should be” since that is in the unreachable future.  NO. If you want to be happy, you must love yourself exactly as you are right now, spots and all. It is a huge mistake to say “I don’t like myself now, but when I make a 6-figure income or when my art is sold at Sotheby’s or when I find the perfect spouse then I will be able to like myself and my life.” It will never happen.   You must understand that we live exclusively in the present moment by moment. If you want to actually live your life you must do so now. There is no other way.  People who don’t know this, tend to live very tentatively and superficially and in the end, when the end of life is approaching, they feel enormous regret and confusion. Where did the time all go? I was going to start living at some point but now it’s too late. Don’t be that way if you can possibly help it.   other people talking trash   It is always a mistake to concern oneself with what other people think (especially with what they think of us). If Mr. Jones thinks I'm an insufferable twit, so what? How is that going to hurt me? And if Mrs. So-and-So thinks I'm a world-class genius, so what? How will that help me?   It is only what you think of yourself that matters. You must be the person you would be if yours were the only opinion that mattered. This can’t be stressed enough.  As a corollary, you must know that it is always a mistake to compare oneself with other people. There is no value in it whatsoever. If you compare to your peers, you may find you are superior to John and you will become prideful and arrogant. If you find you are inferior to Mary, you may become insecure and anxious. Truly comparison must be avoided if one desires to have a happy and calm life.   That does not mean you should ignore criticism altogether, especially if it comes from a source you respect. One should be thankful to those who are kind enough to risk losing our friendship by providing us with pointers about things we might be doing wrong or ways in which we might improve. When this happens, it can be helpful to look into it and see for yourself if what they say has value or if it is bunk.  Regardless of whether you get insults or compliments, in the final analysis, you must please yourself because no one else can do it for you.  Should anyone inform you that you are ""worthless"" you must thank them politely and make sure you never take them seriously again if you can't ignore them altogether in the future.  Unlike your friends who may criticize you out of kindness, those who talk shit do not have your best interests at heart. I hope this is clear.  No one is ""worthless"" and those who judge others this way are the least worthy of all so why should their utterances trouble you? The world is full of crazies, including you and I. This is because we have been raised in a profoundly sick society and it has conditioned us in many pernicious ways that have lodged deep within our brains and can undermine any chance of fully enjoying our lives unless we act decisively to make sure this doesn't take place.  We are here to enjoy ourselves in a spectacular universe. We are not exclusively defined by the man-made world. All human beings have astounding powers. We have brains that turn electromagnetic radiation into colors and forms even from light years away. We have brains that turn pressure waves in air into sublime music. We are the most complex and subtle creatures that we know of by far. Every last one of us is wondrous beyond measure. I wonder why you don’t know this?  To think ""I am worthless"" is the worst possible mistake a person can make. It is to be ungrateful about the most mysteriously wondrous things, immune to and gratitude. Please think about this carefully and see for yourself if you are worthless of wondrous. If you find yourself worthless, I can’t imagine what it would take to satisfy you.  None of these things are taught in schools. We are not taught how to value what we have; we are taught to want more forever. And so we can never be satisfied. This applies to our status, our wealth, our friendships, our pleasures, our looks and all the rest of it. It is a mistake to accept such teachings.  Every  one of us living during this epoch of great bewilderment must find out for ourselves why we want what we want, why we believe every last thing we believe and why we do whatever it is we do. For most of us, the answers to these investigations all end up in the same place. We are this way, think this way, live this way, want this way because we have been conditioned to do so since shortly after birth. These things are not encoded in our DNA.  A child cannot question the wisdom of what his parents teach him. If they tell him he must become a rock star, that is what he will believe. ALL of it is this way.  Every single thing that impinges upon a human brain alters or conditions it. All we are taught, all we observe, all we experience, our values, our beliefs, our traditions, our ambitions and our morality are all conditioned into us like Pavlov dogs. (If you aren't thoroughly familiar with the concept of ""conditioning"" I urge you to look into it asap. Nothing is more important or relevant.)  One you realize where all ""your"" thoughts, desires, dissatisfactions and so on come from you must act to regain control of your own mind. It is not our faults that our parents have filled us up with terrible ideas that will make us wretched every moment of our lives. These ideas were passed on to them by their parents and so on all the way back to the days we lived in trees. If they are accepted without question, they will continue to infect every new human being. This is why each of us must question everything. If we do not, we are little more than robots, living according to our programs.   We are not responsible for all the distorted ideas, crazy ambitions, self-defeating behaviors and so on inserted into our brains but we ARE responsible for questioning every single one of these as adults. We must drag every belief, however innocuous it may appear at first, into the light of day and dissect it mercilessly. If we find it beneficial, we can keep it. If we find it askew we can alter it and if we find it is poison of the worst kind that will make happiness and peace of mind impossible every single day of our miserable lives, we must discard it without remorse.  In the end, the only person you need to please is yourself. You will be happy if you please yourself and miserable if you please others but fail to please yourself. You are the only person you can control (and even all the time).   I highly recommend you read this free pdf if you're interested in this sort of thing."
DecidingToBeBetter,3048cd,fallowmal,2,Fri Mar 27 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"I do understand what you're saying. I agree with you from a logical perspective.   Unfortunately, from an emotional perspective, I don't have the benefit of being (or capability to be) innately mindful. Yet.   What I mean by ""something to strive for"" is that I do know I will eventually get to a point where I am capable of that mindset. I'm just not there yet. I was broken far too early and far too many times. I don't like telling myself that story, though; it bothers me that I don't understand how to get rid of the idea ""that's my story"". I'd definitely prefer to never even reference or remember past events at all. I literally just don't know how to get to that point.  There are a couple of obstacles:  1) My brain is formatted in such a way that I do not naturally create the proper levels of neurotransmitters. As a result, I have issues with escaping rumination. I don't even realize I'm ruminating until I find myself in a deep state of anguish, weeping and feeling physical pain about a specific line of thought. 2) I have issues with flashbacks. I don't have severe PTSD anymore, but I still have vivid dreams and memories that cause me to feel anxious or highly agitated.   I'll check out that paper to see if it can help. However, I've already been doing these things you're saying to do. I'm still missing some piece of the puzzle. There's just something that's not quite clicking.   This is why I say I don't understand how to just automatically be self-loving. I don't really have a ""self"" identity at all. Realistically, I spent 28 years being and believing whatever everyone else told me I was. As ridiculous as that is, in retrospect, I still don't really know who or what I am. I always just accepted that I was whatever everyone else said I was. Now that I do not accept other people's opinions, I don't even have an opinion of myself. I'm just whatever I happen to be. And, I think that's where my misunderstanding comes from.   How can I love someone who doesn't exist?"
DecidingToBeBetter,3048cd,Pongpianskul,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:57:27 2015 UTC,"When we are broken, the cracks are how the light gets in. No matter how painful, it ends up being worth it if we can see clearly what's what. Those already comfortable in the world do not have to look deeply, why should they? Those who's every waking hour is agony are the ones desperate enough to find real answers and unshakeable truths that lead to the end of suffering.  Seeing how things really are is not something we accomplish with thought or learning or figuring it out like people doing math or physics. Actually you are closer than you think.    I'm just whatever I happen to be.   This is actually a far deeper insight and a far greater type of wisdom than you give it credit for. I studied Zen for ten years just to learn this simple fact. The only thing I would add is that ""what happens to be"" is the ""I"". There is no ""I"" that experiences things, there is just the experiencing of things. There is no center, no ego. These are abstractions and do not actually exist. In other words, there is no difference at all between you and what is happening to you right now. They are the same thing.   When we fully understand what we are we surrender unconditionally to the inevitable and stress evaporates. We understand that we will never ever think our way out of this mess in our minds. It isn't possible. Insight comes when we stop trusting thought as the illuminator or truth. Thought, no matter how sophisticated or profound, is not capable of discerning truth. When we learn to put thought aside (temporarily of course!) then the light is there. It is always there. We don't see it because we have turned away from it and give all of our attention to the part of our mind that consists merely of thinking, the part that is conditioned. (If you are not familiar with the concept of ""conditioning"" I urge you very strongly to look it up. Since we are all conditioned by every single thing that impinges on our brains from birth this is something worth knowing.)  The conditioned mind is like a database. It is not the part that observes or creates. All it can do is repeat what it already knows. It contains every single thing we've been taught, all our beliefs, our values, our prejudices, assumptions, personal experiences, all our desires, our conflicts and so on. It is made up of thought and memory (which is congealed thought) and all thought is conditioned, incomplete, fragmented and so on. Thought doesn't expose the truth about anything, it only regurgitates what is already known by those who came before us.  Clearly a bunch of information is NOT self and the conditioned mind is nothing more than information. We've been told that this database is the self but it is not the true self at all. It is more like a computer that gets a bunch of data put into it along with programs to manipulate the data. We are programmed like computers via a language. This isn't just a metaphor, it is the literal truth.  If we identify the conditioned mind or database as the ""I"", we suffer. But if we are able to break through and identify with the part of our minds that is intelligent, the part that observes and creates and cannot be conditioned, we can see truth itself and it sets us free to be happy regardless of the horrible ideas that have stuffed into our memories.  Do NOT trust thoughts. I discovered that the thoughts in my head aren't even mine in any meaningful sense of the word. When did I decide that a good person is a hard-working person? When did I start valuing money? When did I decide that those who cannot conform should self-destruct? I didn't! These values are NOT my own. They tortured me for decades. I spent hours every day saying to myself ""I should die now"" or ""you're garbage"" over and over again like some sick mantra. And that was because that is what was put into my brain by others - not by me! I don't even value those things. I don't respect people who make tons of money. I don't hate those who don't conform! I love them. They are our only hope for survival. Because being well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society is not a sign of mental health. Not by a lonnnng shot.   A couple years ago, I discovered that the intelligent part of us can free itself from the influence of the conditioned mind that when it does so, true insight into the nature of existence and self becomes obvious. It can be done. It is worthwhile.  There is so much I could say to you. You sound so much like me. I too was told I had an imbalance of neurotransmitters in my brain and that was why I had been depressed all my life. This point of view suddenly emerged when the pharmaceutical companies started cranking out ""anti-depressants"" and making tons of money. It is a lie. We are OK. Our problems are NOT the result of brain chemicals at all! They are the result of living in a time entirely devoid of a sane social context. Social creatures cannot do well when order has deteriorated to the point where no one knows why they want what they want, why they believe what they believe or why they do what they do. I call this the Epoch of the Great Bewilderment and I don't know if our kind will survive it. We have made huge advances is technology and NO advances at all psychologically. Our cave-dwelling ancestors were probably way more well adjusted, sane and happy than we are today. I think this is obvious.   It took me years to understand that there was nothing wrong with my brain. Depression is PTSD. If you see too much horrible shit at a young age, the brain recoils. Then, to protect itself from further brutality it numbs itself out in self-defense. The only way to stop being depressed is to look into the self very deeply, expose all the lies and uncover the truth. One of the best discussions of this came from a link I found here about a year ago. It is a lecture on YouTube by psychologist Bruce Levine who says that depression, stress, anxiety and all the various disorders are the results of living in a coercive and terminally confused society. No other cause is needed. Even the most perfect brain will react to brutality by becoming hopelessly confused, miserable and neurotic.  You must find out what you are if you want to know sanity and happiness. There is nothing more important. The fact that you know this is proof that you can do it. Read the pdf I linked to in my previous post. Watch YouTube videos that feature J. Krishnamurti or any others that catch your eye, Bruce Levine and also the video (audio only) of David Bohm's Seminar on Consciousness because he delves deeply into the nature of thought and nails it though it takes a long time. It is worth putting up with every second of the slowness. These people will lead you to others worth knowing. I wish you the best. Write any time."
DecidingToBeBetter,3048cd,Pongpianskul,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:30:34 2015 UTC,What you say has been true in my life. At age 50 I decided that I would cease all efforts at self improvement. I decided I was good enough and that I'd stop fiddling with it.  This was the beginning of the greatest improvements imaginable.  Since early childhood I had been rejected by human beings for being unacceptably different and I had internalized that rejection and applied it mercilessly to myself for decades.  Once I decided to stop improving I found a way to love myself as is. And soon after a tremendous happiness that is not dependent upon circumstances became possible. I'm still amazed at it since it is so different from all I have known before.

DecidingToBeBetter,302xex,rakatin,14,Tue Mar 24 08:53:42 2015 UTC,"Any substance that takes away your ability to experience happiness from anything but more of that substance is evil.   Meth puts your neurotransmitters on overdrive, just completely draining your dopamine levels, and simultaneously inhibits your neuroreceptors which are responsible for the re-uptake of that dopamine to be recycled. A good analogy would be a mouth (transmitter) screaming at an ear (receptor) until it loses its voice and the ear goes deaf (this kills this brain cells). So it gives you a feeling of pleasure normally triggered by positive experiences like physical intimacy, a delicious meal, shooting some hoops, etc.   But this is a double edged sword, because once all that dopamine is depleted, not only do you feel incredibly depressed and hopeless, but those simple joyful things can also no longer trigger a positive response in your brain. The only thing that can possibly make you feel any better is more meth.   I can tell you from personal experience, the high is fun while it lasts but the price is too high. Way too high. Even using once can put you in a place where you need to use again and again. It doesn't take long at all to be totally miserable anytime you aren't using. Pair this with the long term effects, such as dead brain cells, permanently depleted dopamine levels causing long term depression, and do I even need to mention ""faces of meth""?  This drug is the epitome of the phrase ""not even once"". I'm one of the very few lucky ones. Even among users that actually go through rehab, only 12% manage to stay clean.   METH"

It really taught me that the things I had to say were important, that I had self-worth, and it taught me how to listen to the voice inside me saying what I would enjoy doing.  It also taught me that the interactions I had with my parents were very draining and ""erasing"".  I had to learn that it was okay for them to be rude and uncaring, and that it didn't reflect on me as a person.  I cut down a lot of contact and just accepted that they are not healthy/happy individuals.  Sounds like you might have something similar with them."
DecidingToBeBetter,301rc7,FinnianWhitefir,6,Mon Mar 23 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"This just blew my mind a little bit. I pretty much gave up video games about a year ago, it just kind of hit me all at once that I was wasting my time.   Meanwhile, Everytime I see a motorcycle I think I want to do that that, that should be me. Yet, I keep talking myself out of it because its not historically fitting with my personality. I don't want to spend all my money on games, I want to go fast, damnit."
DecidingToBeBetter,301rc7,FinnianWhitefir,8,Mon Mar 23 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"Hah,  I spent all my 20s and most of my 30s thinking I was playing video games because I wanted to.  When I realized that I was doing it to keep away from scary things like other people and social interactions, I ended up taking a two-day Intro to Motorcycling class and got my license.  I bought one, it was neat, it was enough of a hassle/anxious thing that I didn't ride it enough to get really comfortable and it's sat in my garage for a year.  Not to discourage you, just chiming in that I had the same thought and it provides a ton of self-respect for me to know that I wanted to do it and I did it.  For my story in case it helps, what I realized is that my parents are amazing nay-sayers.  I grew up with this constant ""Kayaking would be fun"" to hear ""Yeah, but it costs a lot, you'd have to drive hours to do it, you might fall in, it's really just boring floating around on the water, etc"" and really grew to accept that I should look at all the potential negatives and downsides to anything, and gave up ever trying to have fun.  Once I broke free of that, which was hard as there were decades of built-up anxiety and self-hatred, there was a lot of great ""I want a motorcycle, let's go get one"" to ""I want to go out and take a trip, guess I'll get a hotel in Vegas for a couple nights and go"", and today it's easier to accept that I'm worth doing all these things."
DecidingToBeBetter,301rc7,PervyLemming,7,Mon Mar 23 23:49:34 2015 UTC,I can see this as a movie of my childhood.

She's just so positive about everything,but at the same time she's not really supportive. Anytime I try to do something,she usually has an opposite oppinion than me,and we almost constantly argue about everything. Staying with you example,if I wanted to try out kayaking she would be like,yeah that sounds super,I'm so glad,but you know you have to go to all of the trainings,even if the weather is shitty and blablabla... And at the end it's always if you wanna do it,you can,that's awesome,and then she starts over with her arguments... She always just took my mood away,untill i was like ""I guess you're right"" and then just let it go. By the end of my little essay I think she might still be a naysayer...."

Basically, she gives some lip-service to ""Yeah, do it if you want"" but then includes a whole bunch of undermining ""It's going to be bad, things might go wrong, etc"" reasons not to do it.  I don't mean that my parents would discourage me from doing things, but they would come up with all these potentially bad things that might happen, and bring them up as reasons not to do anything.  I.E. ""The weather might be bad, it is cold there, you'd have to train a lot before you did it or enjoyed it"".  It is this break between ""I would enjoy doing X"" and ""X might be really unenjoyable"" that led to me never doing X for decades in my life until I was able to work through all these ""If I do X something bad might happen"".  I'm finally to a point where I realize I need to try 20 Xs, I'm going to hate 10, I'm going to experience 5 and never bother doing them again, and I'm going to love 5 and want to do them a lot more in my life.  But you have to do those 20 to figure out what those 5 are."

I also thought cutting my parents out of my life,but I definiately wouldn't be able to do it completely,since I'm still young and living with them.

It can literally be anything, anything at all, just as long as it makes you happy. From satire to horror movies to kittens to Scrabble to houseplants to music to children to comic books and everything in between. Probably better if it isn't booze or drugs, but if you're really, really struggling, it is whatever it is.   Next, let yourself truly embrace the pleasure of the thing you've selected. Seriously. Don't rain on your own parade. Love this thing.  Then, set aside a definite time for this everyday. Or at least as often as possible. But make it a definite time slot-- it cannot be indefinite or else it loses its novelty and appeal.   Once you have a target/goal, whatever it may be, that is entirely personal to you, view all of the other, far more unenjoyable aspects of life as merely necessary evils to achieve that special time for that thing that makes you happy. Before long, those other problems will begin to feel less important, less overbearing, and more like obstacles that will be surmounted one way or another. Because they have to be, so you can do your thing.   Finally, once you've mastered the process of doing this for one goal, seek out other things to strive for. Rinse and repeat. The burden will have been lifted and the energy will flow from within. Build a cycle of positive reinforcement."

You must enjoy yourself now or never. You must learn to be your own most supportive fan. You must change the habit of self-criticism to one of self-praise.   You do not need to wait until you believe you deserve unconditional approval, all you need to do is decide very deliberately that you will consider yourself marvelous from now on whether or not you succeed at various tasks and goals you may consider important.  This post says it better than I ever could. Don't balk at the wall of text. Read it all. It may be the exact thing you need for happiness in this life.   I lived what the person in this post is talking about and it's amazing. Now, after decades of being the most miserable person on earth, I've found happiness and peace that does not in any way depend of things going my way. It is extraordinary and all human beings ought to have it.   There is simply no good reason not to enjoy yourself during your very short time as a human being in a spectacular universe. Allow yourself to live outside of the man-made world as well as within it. Living exclusively in the man-made world destroys perspective and distorts our understanding of what's important and what isn't."

That's pretty much it.   The future doesn't exist yet, you can be whatever you want to be. If you do wake up one day as a person you don't like, you will be able to change yourself simply because you recognize you're a person you don't like.  Practice being mindful (present in the moment, thoughtful, living with intent) in your daily life, and you won't have to worry about becoming someone you don't want to be."

Of course your mind is giving you roadblocks. Changing is tough. Part of that idea is staying grounded. Reminding yourself why you've done what you've done.   I lost 70+ lbs. it changed my relationship with the world. I don't surround myself with really unhealthy people now. Not because I look down on them, but because you really are affected by things around you. If I hear someone saying they want to lose weight then give excuse after excuse as to why they can't, then I recognize they are an Excuses Person, and not something I want to surround myself with.   Guess what--you still are you. Your changes may also help you be MORE empathetic with folks. Have you noticed that most counsellors were once in the bad spot themselves? Drug counsellors, weight loss coaches, etc. If you have a very empathetic personality, there is zero reason you should worry about that going away.

There's no one, easy way out, but there is a way out -- we just have to figure out what it is.  First, a few questions:    What's your diet like? How much sleep do you get? How much exercise do you get? Are you taking any supplements, like fish oil? Are you on medication?   I'm not going to lie, medication played a huge part in my ability to cope early on, but once I was a few rungs up the ladder healthy changes in the categories above has made a huge difference in my well-being. Your body is a machine, right? The better you care for it, the easier it will be to weather what you're going through.  But I know about the fog, the feeling that you can't think and all you can do is sit there like a lump waiting for life to happen. Like I said, it took medication for me to shake me out of it, though fish oil helped to an extent, too.   And Vitamin D3. I don't know if you suffer from SAD, but I'm always a lot worse in the winter -- regular exposure to sunlight or Vitamin D supplements will help.  Look, all I can say is this: It feels hopeless right now. It feels eternal. But it's not. The moment you're thinking clearly for the first time, and that feeling of excitement and productivity hits you, you'll see it all was worth it. We're rooting for you."

DecidingToBeBetter,300ifz,dustylocks,9,Tue Mar 24 00:57:45 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear you are having such a hard time. I reviewed your post history briefly and unfortunately there was not much history for me to draw on, but what WAS there is very telling.  Obviously I don't know you, and your reddit history doesn't speak to you as a person. But it does give some indication as to where a persons mind is at, and from what I can see you have and are having quite a struggle with not just depression but an underlying feeling of inadequacy. Additionally you seem to have felt this way for some time and have struggled over time to improve or at least come to grips with how you fell.  Firstly, I TOTALLY relate. I absolutely know how that feels. Despite the fact that I graduated high school with a 4.2 GPA I'm the stupid one in my family. My father was chemical engineer then became a commodities trader to make shit tons of money. Then my brother has a Masters Degree and is working on his Ph.D. So believe me when I say I understand the inadequacy / not living up to your families aspirations feelings you are having.  Additionally, i've struggled with depression my whole life. I've seen several psychologists and psychiatrists (keep in mind they are different things)  and while it has been helpful to some degree it never really treated or solved my problem. But this betrays the fact that, if i'm being honest I don't think it is fixable. I will probably always struggle with depression from now till the day I die. I'm also only moderately older than you, so that awkward stage of life you are in right now I know all too well.   So I can tell you with absolute certainty, you are fine the way you are. I don't mean in the cheesy carebear bullshit way that ""everyone is great and a special snowflake the way they are"" way. I mean in the, ""There is nothing broken about you, you are not any less smart or valuable than anyone else"" way. I can guarantee you this with absolute certainty. You will look back at this point of your life, some time in the future, and wonder how you ever could have doubted you would make it.   Depression sucks, i'll tell you that much for sure. It saps... EVERYTHING out of your life. It makes food taste less good, it makes the sun less warm, it makes the grass less green, and it makes life less fun. That shit sucks man, no two ways around it. But, you can't let it control you, it's all in your head. To you, in the moment, it's very real. But there is no physical force keeping you in bed, there is no restraints binding your books closed. The only way to truly ""beat"" depression is to stand up to it, grapple that bitch by the horns, and refuse to let it beat you.  How do I know this? Because I live that shit every, single, day. I'm not just talking the talk, i'm walking the walk. And the walk is fucking hard. Now I could go on and talk about how great I am, but that isn't going to help you or make you feel any better.   The capital T Truth of the matter is, you just never quit. No matter what, do, not, quit. I don't mean ignore good sense and be reckless. If something is an absolute lost cause. If it is going to cause you or someone else physical harm or legal trouble, then maybe find something more productive to focus your energies on. In almost all other circumstances though the moment you quit, the moment you let your depression, self doubt, and wavering confidence get stronger. It makes it HARDER to come back the next time, not easier.   For me, what I refuse to quit is my coding. That shit is hard as balls, i'm not especially good at math, and my attention span is pretty short. Programming requires a lot of both, it's a real struggle for me some times. But, I do actually enjoy it, I like tinkering with a script that I just can't get right for hours and then when I finally figure out what the problem is it's very rewarding.   I may never get paid for what at the moment is a hobby, but i'm getting close to being a professional level at it. But i'm making progress. You can't let your existence be judged based on where you are, but rather how hard you work to progress.   You can be the smartest, strongest, fastest, most talented, and luckiest son of a bitch in the world. But you will get your ass kicked every single time by the guy who stayed up late, put in 100% every day, and worked their ass off. Even if you are (though you aren't) as shit as you say / feel you are, you put your all into it, and you will completely conquer everything.   This is running pretty long so i'll wrap up, but check out the poem Invictus, It's one of my favorites and applies here beautifully. You have strength inside you that you couldn't even imagine, it's just a question of letting that out. And if you feel like i'm putting you on, or blowing smoke up your ass, or some other cynical nonsense, don't. I feel this for everyone, not just those that I identify with personally (such as yourself). The thing that separates you from insert your hero here is time, and effort. Everything else is a secondary consideration. Some days, you will lose, you will fall, you WILL fail. I've failed. Everyone who has ever done anything of consequence failed. Do NOT let that drive you into the ground, forgive yourself, move on, and do better the next day. Keep your chin up, the world isn't as scary or hostile as it seems.  TL;DR I feel you man. Keep your head up, forgive yourself, know that there is nothing you can't do, and NEVER stop working."

Surround yourself with positive and encouraging company and remember to say positive affirmations to yourself aloud every day.  Don't think too much, and keep yourself busy. Doesn't matter what the task is, simple or complex...just stay busy. Talk to people with the intent to listen and make it your foremost goal to offer value to others and the world around you. The less you allow yourself to be affected by externalities (other's opinions about you included), the more control you will feel you have over yourself.  Don't live to gain approval...live to be useful."

Just because the first three weren't right for you doesn't mean there isn't one out there who will suit you. Use the first meeting like a job trial. 50% I knew weren't right after the first ten minutes. But I knew my guy was good before I even met him, his website just resonated with me.

Even if it's by yourself, shooting a basketball and watching it go in the hoop is so satisfying. Picking up a soccer ball and being able to juggle it to 10 hits is pretty satisfying too. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither will honing these skills, but as I said they are accomplishments.  Even if you say get an injury while doing any kind of activity. You can still go outside. I, personally, go outside and write screenplays for movie ideas at a local park. It's just a personal hobby and I hope to be able to pick up filmmaking in the future to show these ideas, but it's being outside that's truly the gift.  I used to spend my days in my dark room, watching movies, playing video games,  browsing the Internet & I just found myself way too depressed & flat out not happy with myself. Pushing yourself outside is hard & even I don't want to do it everyday, but it's really changed my life.  Try it for a full month. No facebook, no twitter, no social media. Go outside to a park whenever you have time. Maybe find a community pool if you enjoy swimming and try to reach lap goals. Try it."

You will slowly mature and learn step by step as you go. You will make mistakes, and you will learn from them.  My final piece of advice is to cultivate positive relationships.

You'll have to fight, try different strategies and tactics and maybe even lose an arm or eye along the way.  I know talk is cheap when you're at the bottom and there are plenty of people who are telling you ""there is light at the end of the tunnel"". They're right but that probably isn't that much use right in this moment.  Here's what I can say. It doesn't matter how shit you feel, there will be something for you that is a positive. Even if you're standing with the noose around your neck, there will be at least one thing that you are grateful for. Find it, and hold onto it for dear life.  For me, it was purely that I was lucky enough to be conscious and experience. It didn't matter that it was a shit experience and that my conscious mind was filled with muck and dark. I was PRIVILEGED enough to be able to feel and experience. I also discovered that flowers are awesome and a relative constant in my area.   This didn't change my depression but it gave me an anchor. Something to give me a break from the negative thinking. If you can find yours, even if it is ""I FUCKING LOVE SPONGEBOB AND I'M GOING TO WATCH IT FOR THREE DAYS!!!"" do that. Do your thing.

Though facing your depression is half the way and you should congrat yourself for doing this.  First step is to not treat yourself as being defective or shitty. You are not! Treat yourself with respect, analyze how you abuse yourself and try to change how you manipulate yourself. Then feed yourself with positive things.   That might not change everything but it is a start. Look further for help and don't let yourself down, that is the worst you can do. Search for psychologists that fit you. Try medication and if the first one doesn't fit try another one until you find something that works for you. There are endless ways out of this maze and you are not alone.

Some people are able to overcome the worst of it & change their thought processes, but most people will still have symptoms for their entire lives. You might benefit from a medication that boosts dopamine, though.  There is an easy way to change your life, but you still have to make changes. All you have to do is change one thing every so often.   So, for example, you don't like being a complainer. Next time you feel like whining, take a deep breath instead. Give yourself a chance to think, ""What could I do to change this?"" And then do what you can do to change it. It's effort on your part. Just keep doing these small changes every day, and eventually things will look different.  Realistically, nothing is going to change if you're not willing to do it yourself. Nobody else can fix your life for you. The whole point of therapy, for example, is so that you can learn new ways to cope in your life. Those new coping mechanisms have to be used, not just heard and discarded."

DecidingToBeBetter,300ifz,jet_silver,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:43:46 2015 UTC,"Here are some stories that may change your mind:   1) My friend's mom would periodically go away from their home. She would wind up thousands of miles away, without any idea how she got there. Repeat every six to eight months for several years. Medical puzzlement ensued. Some bright spark tried a bunch of primary (elemental) salts on her and found she had a boron deficiency in her brain. All she has to do these days is touch a huge crystal of boric acid in the foyer every day to retain her day-by-day stability; she hasn't gone walkies in years. It is micrograms per day of boron that changes her mental processes.   2) The CDC says 57% of people are deficient in magnesium. I'm one of them and I found that out because of a lucky accident: cramps. My shins and thighs would cramp up during exercise and it got to be pretty bad, so I started taking magnesium supplements and not only did the cramps disappear, so did my depression.   I realized I had been depressed, continuously, and because of a chemical deficiency, for forty years.   Don't live like I did, it sucks. Consider the possibility you are lacking an essential nutrient and consult a neurologist to see whether you are getting enough of the trace elements you need for proper brain function.   There are lots of causes of depression and not all of them are because of psychological issues. They can be physical, chemical issues and the way to fix those is get enough of the element or chemical that resolves it.   Part of the delight of that is how would you know you were missing a trace element? It's hard to think you're an unworthy person because you hate, for example, almonds which have plenty of magnesium."

I'm probably wrong and feel free to change my mind but it seems a little self-centred.   I see nothing wrong with the success posts. Sometime to acknowledge that you're doing better you need to actually acknowledge it by putting it into the world, whether it is telling your bff about it, your mom, or posting it on reddit. Sometimes it is okay to toot your own horn if it's for the right reasons; self improvement is one of those right reasons.    Can't we just want to be better people because of a genuine desire to have a more positive impact on those around you.    What does it matter what someone's reason is to be better? I'm not sure I understand your post, but it sounds like you feel like people are deciding to do better, and posting about their successes, and that is not okay because if they posted about it here, they didn't do it for the right reasons? It shouldn't matter who or what you changed yourself for the better for, as long as you've changed for the better.   Now, personally, the kind of posts I don't appreciate seeing here are the ""I'm depressed and there is no way out"" posts.

I didn't interpret what he said as relying on others' opinions for your self-worth. I see it as taking pride in being a positive contributor in the community.   For example: you volunteer for a night at a homeless shelter. A self-centered person would brag about it on Facebook and base their self-worth on the affirmation they get from that. A self-confident person doesn't bother telling anyone and finds self-worth in simply helping the people at the shelter.

DecidingToBeBetter,30005t,trancematik,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:57:33 2015 UTC,"To me having positive impact on yourself and those around you is intimately linked. This is because in my experience qualities of selfless service, compassion, unconditional love, wise action, etc. comes from loving yourself and being secure in yourself.  It's a common misconception among people in general that doing wise and good deeds is what gives you the personal qualities like strength, self-confidence, fame, status, wealth etc. E.g. by accomplishing a great feat you will start to think highly of yourself. But in my experience it's getting it backwards. You start by thinking highly of yourself, you start by loving yourself unconditionally, by being secure in yourself - and the good deeds, accomplishments etc. flows from that.  If you don't trust and love yourself your actions and the world will reflect that in many ways - people won't like you because you see the worst in them. You will self-sabotage your own and others efforts (because you don't like yourself). You won't be good leader or work well in a team so you will have problems with your career - unless you are a boxer or something.. you won't be curious and interested to learn about life because you fear and mistrust what you will find... the list goes on.   So love yourself. Think highly of yourself - because you are awesome. If you can do that you show others that they can do the same - you will be an inspiration. You'll naturally let your love flow towards others - and you'll have a positive impact on the world."

When setting goals for yourself it helps a lot to do so in a positive way. Don't use words like ""stop"" or ""do x less"", but turn it around and write out what positive effect you'd like to see. That way it's a lot easier and more rewarding to imagine yourself doing it, and thus easier/more rewarding to work towards.  For example:   Stop talking to yourself like you’re a piece of shit -> Talk nicer about yourself     Stop fixating on negative shit -> Start looking at the positive side in things    Stop doing things that require twists of logic and excuses in order to believe in their non-shittiness -> Start doing things because you genuinely think they would be the right thing to do   etc.  You're working on yourself. You're willing to change. Your motives are good, so don't berate yourself so much. You're allowed to be kind to yourself."
DecidingToBeBetter,3019hh,isogram,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"Start taking responsibility for your behavior at all times   It is possible to be kind no matter what kind of mood you're in. You can get control over your anxiety and do the things you want to do.  Speak kindly to yourself   See that post up there? You're in a habit of talking to yourself like that. You can change this. It will help you. Berating yourself AND over-pitying yourself are both doing harm. Try observing the self without judgment and being conscious of the things that cause pain. Respect the power of the written word. Negative tone can seep into your head, but positive tone can too. Things will start feeling better when you start flooding yourself with positivity.  In that same vein, try to entertain yourself only with positive content.   You have already taken steps to remove some of the known negative entertainment sources in your life. This is a good first step. It's hard to stay away from completely, though, so continue to stay conscious of your surroundings. Disengage when they start to feel bad. Keep up the work on your social media hiatus - there has already been positive change from this.  There are good and bad sides to most situations. Let's work on focusing on the positive ones.   People also all have these good and bad sides, yourself included. You want people to try to see your good side, so do them the same favor. MTV posted that surprisingly progressive article about chronic illness. It was nice to see that kind of content coming from that source. They did post it at a time when few people will see it, but posting it at all is a step in the right direction.  You'll find it easier to like yourself if you make a conscious effort to behave in a likeable way.   What does likeable mean to you? Thinking back to the times in your life when you felt the most self-confident, you were doing a good job at treating others in a way you could be proud of. That clearly makes you feel good. You can start doing that again and get the same outcome. You can settle a lot of your internal conflict by making a conscious effort to take the obvious high road. Behave in a manner whose morality you never have to question. You already know that liking yourself is far more satisfying than being liked by others. You can tell yourself that you're great every day; others will only do this sometimes. You used to like yourself, and you can get back to that place by improving your behavior. Make yourself worthy of the self-esteem you want to have. You have done this before and you can do it again. Remember that you will not develop a deep sense of self-confidence just by having kind thoughts; you must follow through with actions.  Being a good person doesn’t mean doing one really great thing once and then getting a free pass for the rest of your life. You have to consciously decide to be a good person every day.   You have done a lot of things in the past that you are proud of, but the self-confidence that comes with these wears off as they become more and more distant. Life hasn't been easy for you. You found it easier to be a good person before you got sick. You found it easier to like yourself while you were sick, because the mere act of surviving felt like an accomplishment. You're kind of new to holding yourself to ""normal people"" standards, now. Most of your teenage years were spent under very strange circumstances. It's okay that you're having trouble adjusting. But it is time to adjust to not being sick anymore. Take care not to fall into the trap once again of needing to continuously do great things in order to like yourself. This takes a lot of energy and is difficult to maintain. Work on developing that sense of inherent self-worth. Deeds will help this along, but try not to depend on them. There is a tendency to use talent as a reason for self-worth, but you've found that this isn't very satisfying either. It's time to treat your self-esteem problems not by just trying to become more and more talented, and to instead focus on character traits. What you're really craving is to feel like you're a good friend and someone who has integrity.    That felt really good. Great suggestion, thank you."

First, no one can tell you what job you should get. There's too many variables and the job market is to unstable for something like that.  Similarly, I don't think anyone can tell you how to overhaul your life, especially since you provided no information about why you feel you need an overhaul other than you want a good job.   What were you expecting with these two posts? There isn't an instruction manual for life on the internet, believe me I've tried looking. Lol however, if you want to elaborate a little more on your post you could probably get some advice on where to begin and go from there.  Also if you don't like anyone's advice, you can do a quick search for past threads made by people in a similar situation and read until you find some ideas you think will fit you."

When I just slow down I end up enunciating better, become much clearer, and stumble/mumble words less.   I also agree with /u/Camti5 in that learning to breath properly helps a lot. I have very rapid and shallow breaths normally, and that really exacerbates the problem. Taking nice deep breaths helps wonders. It also keeps you much calmer."

Short of that, I'd recommend simply envisioning that the person you're talking to is standing another 5 feet away from you. A former choir conductor of mine would go up into the farthest away seat in any auditorium and had us sing to him there, which made us focus on projecting. Might work for you.  As the other person said, breathing/diaphragm control is really important, but that can be hard to remember to do in the moment.   Edit: you could also ask this question on voice/performance/choir subs. Not sure what's out there as I'm not subscribed to any."

DecidingToBeBetter,2zy1c2,DrewNumberTwo,6,Mon Mar 23 01:13:53 2015 UTC,"If you say something and someone can't hear it consistently, then you should realize that you're intention is probably divided in your communication.  What this means is, essentially, when you say something that's meant to be heard, it will be. Same for when you are saying things that you don't really mean to be heard. If in general you are always low talking and people can't hear you, that means you consistently had a divided intention. One part of you is trying to speak, because logically and rationally, as well as pragmatically, you'll have to speak. But deep down, for whatever reason, you don't feel like speaking, or being heard. Or maybe that you don't feel like you deserve to be heard? I can't be sure. But you should really do some listening to yourself, and trying to get to the root of why that is. You are probably operating under some faulty beliefs. Try meditation to help you become more self aware with your feelings and what is happening in the moment. Maybe take a positivity challenge. Also focus on breathing deeper. If you low talk, then you want to focus on your diaphragm, throat, all of that.  When you are in such a situation, try to not get bogged down into self judgement, and just focus on feeling good in your body. And when you can feel good in your body, just try to talk as it feels good/natural to you. YOu'll find it easier to talk when you do  A more exciting route you could take would be to chellenge your self; with a public speaking class or an improv class, or something of the life. I definitely encourage you to go this route."

I feel very self conscious trying to boom my voice in any other setting, as it just seems rude. It seems to make normal conversation louder because yelling in that environment, especially if you don't normally speak loudly, requires exercising your diaphragm and chest in such a way to actually be somewhat heard and it seems to carry over.

I appreciated that in the class, I was able to go up and present prepared material on note cards (so I wasn't going into it blind and anxious), but I also had to avoid reading the cards as much as possible and make eye contact.   It also taught me that if I want to make a good point, I have to engage my audience. I had to practice my speeches many times in front of many different people, confidently delivering my words and making them fully believe me and even take my side.  The class helped me learn a lot about posture, using correct language to deliver my points, and generally how to improve in communicating what I have to say.  Additionally, perhaps a singing or chorus class can help you learn to project better. Even if you can't sing, it can teach you a lot.  TL;DR- Speech class or singing class could help you a lot."

So, it's similar, but different. but two things really helped me out:  a) my Daily Recital Pieces.  generally they're poems, but I don't really like poetry, so I started mixing in song lyrics too.  anyhow, pick one you like, or shit, you don't even really have to like it.  and every day say it two or three times.  Outloud. play aroundwith your annunciation and diction, and you'll find the right ""pace"" for that particular poem.  You'll also practice projection (which I really feel is quite different from ""volume""), and I'm sure someone more formally trained in eloqution can define it better, but it seems for me to be a matter of ""from the gut"".   Whether it's your faviroite verse from James Joyce's Ulysses, or Run DMC's ""You Be Illin'"", you'll find a great amount of pride and confidence in finally being able to rattle that off verbatim, with your own found sense of timing.  b)  I have a mental imagery for projection as well that is facilitated by my physical act of talking - and that is seeing my voice, my words, project in a comic-book-like cone of power straight to the last person in the room.   doing this, I find my tone steadies, my annuncation gets clear, my pace settles down to a rhythm, and it's easy to be understood at those distances.  Other than that, I think it's like any skill - it takes practice.    I hope this helps some.  feel free to ask questions if I wasn't clear.  Good Luck!"

Some of the best activities are those that will help you in all aspects from life, till the day you die. That activity is anything related to people skills. Anyone who is good with people will get very far in life.   I used to socialize by going to meetup groups (but that was very time consuming because I live far from the groups). I've now expanded socializing to playing basketball at the park. It's amazing because it's a combination of exercise and social skills improving. It's learning to make better eye contact, read body language while playing, and playing with other teammates. Obviously some people playing basketball have bad personality, so I don't play with those people. It doesn't take very long to smell those types.

DecidingToBeBetter,2zvvvt,TheTarkAttack,16,Sun Mar 22 11:18:16 2015 UTC,"Sure. You could use any app really, or even use youtube videos. There's tonnes of resources out there. I personally found it easier to follow a guided meditation to begin with.   The meditations themselves can vary quite a lot. I've never done more than 10 minutes, but I do plan to extend my times at some point.   One of my favourites is a body scan. You sit and focus on various areas of the body at a time and notice sensations in each area. For example you might start by focusing on where your butt is on the seat, the sensation of your back against the seat rest. Then you could start at the top of your body and work your way down, feeling each area in turn. This helps root your mind in the here and now.   Another breathing exercise that I found helpful: Focus on your breath. Not breathing deeply or any of that shit, but your normal breath. Where do you notice it most? Could be the rise and fall of your chest, or the feeling of the air rushing through your nose. Focus on that area and with each in-breath mentally say to yourself ""breathing in"", with each out-breath say ""breathing out"". This helps keep your mind occupied.   The most important thing is to simply try and let your thoughts pass. You are observing your thoughts, you are separate. If you find your mind wandering, simply note that it was wandering and move back to focus.   It's been ridiculously useful to me, I've helped myself focus by ticking off each day on a calender so I can see the progress. Once you get beyond a 3 day streak, it becomes really important to add to it rather than break the habit streak.   I hope you find this useful. I cannot recommend meditation enough.   Edit: As other people have commented, I would also recommend one habit at a time. I'm focusing on meditation for 60 days before I make any other commitments. Strangely enough though, the exercise thing happened without me trying. I kinda just want to. Its so weird."

Without debt, you can have as many beginnings as you'd like... no guarantee you'll get anywhere though. Money seems to be the only way up.

DecidingToBeBetter,2zqpwb,snooppugg,7,Fri Mar 20 21:09:58 2015 UTC,"I had a ton of free time this winter, and being that it was a Chicago winter, I didn't get out much. These are the things that I did to keep my sanity:  Work out. It may seem obvious, but engaging in physical activity has benefited me, not only by getting in better shape, but restoring my awful sleep cycle. I get a way better night's rest when I've worked out.  Read a book. Anything that will occupy your time will do. If you have a university library, check it out.  Learn a skill. If you have free time, and access to workshops, you can pick up a hobby in creating something. I've dabbled in blacksmithing and woodworking recently, and it ate up a ton of free time. These are just my own examples, but you can easily expand to anything the art department may offer(bonus points if you can do it as an elective class)  Lastly, I began trying to learn a new language. This may be a daunting task if you're still in school(I've been out for 5 years, so I have no other courseload.) Using Duolingo, I've been mentally engaged in a way I haven't been for years.  Heed my advice if you can, or ignore it if you'd like. These were the methods of keeping myself busy recently, and I feel it would be good to pass it on."

I'm definitely going to start making a list and force myself to get back into reading to occupy my time.  I'm happy to hear that you've noticed a difference from working out. It's one of those things that I always pushed to the back of my mind, but I really think I need it now more than ever.  Thank you for a response!"
DecidingToBeBetter,2zqpwb,Jambo_Sazza,5,Fri Mar 20 21:48:32 2015 UTC,"I can't stress enough getting into a good workout routine while you have the time. Once you establish a routine, it will most likely be pretty seamless to incorporate once things do pick up for you and your health should always be a priority.   Additionally, look into perfecting that one skill that will set you apart once you graduate college and are looking for a job in your industry. Whether it be a course in facilitation, becoming an expert in a particular software, or working towards getting published, it is extremely helpful and comforting to know you have that one leg up on everyone else. Now is the time to do it when you have the time and can only build upon the skill.   Also, spend some time and give real thought to a hobby that you think you could enjoy long term. It's so fulfilling to have something to tinker with and research when you have the flexibility of doing it on your terms. Photography, model airplanes, cooking, whatever, but it is also a great way to have an ""in"" if moving to a new city and looking for a new group new friends. Even clicking 'Random' on Reddit and looking into anything that fascinates you is a great way to get started.   Lastly, look to volunteer. You said you've been unhappy and volunteering can do great things for your self esteem. Try to find something you'll be comfortable with - don't like children? Don't be a Big Brother, don't like old folks? Don't deliver meals on wheels, but try to really look towards something you think you would enjoy. Now that it's puppy/kitten season it can be a great time to volunteer at a shelter.   Finally, I give myself the rule of 3's when it comes to anything new. Try it three times and if you aren't enjoying it move on. Often times we'll spend a lot of time trying to force a hobby or exercise when it's just not something that makes our heart flutter. The first time it's all so new you're anxious and not really absorbing it, the second time you're more familiar and a bit more comfortable and by the third time if you haven't yet got the 'bug' for whatever it is, look into exploring other options."

DecidingToBeBetter,2zpehv,PervyLemming,3,Fri Mar 20 15:00:46 2015 UTC,"Accept your ego but if you practice interrogating your thoughts it needn't be fragile or limiting. You're human, it's ok.  What do I mean by interrogating thoughts? View your thoughts without value judgements. That shirt is ugly, I don't like it. It's ok for me to not like it but for me to declare that it's ugly is a value judgement. It's not going to be ugly to everyone, calling it ugly means I'm comparing it to something else when it should be able to just exist on its own merits, ugliness is not an absolute value and therefore not a truth it's an opinion so why hold onto it? I can just let it go. It's barely important. I can observe the shirt and the thought, not be offended by it, not be sad that there are ugly shirts in the world. I can ask myself why is the shirt ugly to me? What need am I attaching that to? Why do I need it to be ugly? Usually the only reason to value and compare is to find the way in which we are special, notable or superior. And yes, being the worst and lowest and most pathetic or selfish are ways of winning this game. Why do I need to do that with the things I compare myself against in my thoughts? Practice just observing thoughts and not comparing them to things you think you already know. We can only recognize things in other people that we know within ourselves. You can see selfishness in other people because you know what it feels like to be and act selfish. You read guardedness and manipulation in others because it is what you practice. Observe your thoughts about others and when you identify them you will only be able to name them with things you know.   But if you observe them without intent you might start to feel other patterns emerge. It's hard at first. I think people have more success with it when then approach it as mindful meditation but it's the same idea. The purpose is to find authenticity in yourself so you don't have to constantly be comparing your inner and outer worlds and keep them aligned. I guess this is what people call 'being one with the universe', really just aligning your thoughts so you're not in conflict with yourself all the time.  Surrounding yourself with beautiful people is just an insecurity. Having others evaluate and esteem your companions visually means less work for you socially. You think their opinion of you is  improved by the pretty company you keep but if they don't know you, likely they don't care. Insecurity is a true vanity, or something like that.  There is no such thing as a 'nice guy' that's why the quotes are derogatory. If one of us is bad we're all bad because we condone the behaviours of the 'evil bastards' when we don't call them out on their bullshit even if we don't behave that way ourselves.   Maybe your authenticity lies somewhere that people shouldn't be comfortable around you because you don't want to be a selfish 'nice guy' any more satisfied with the status quo. Maybe you will start asking your thoughts why you don't talk to people about the things they do that bother you?   TL;DR: try meditation."
DecidingToBeBetter,2zpehv,PervyLemming,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:16:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you: your comment made think of what I'm doing and thinking about in a different light.  I shall, first of all, do a devil's advocate run on it (that is, I shall take the ideas you express and advocate for the opposite) to see whether I understand your ideas correctly or find out how can I apply them.  It doesn't mean that I support the opposite points to what you express: it means that I want to go from the other end of the question and find out where the two meet, which usually means that I will be able to find where the truth lies. I hope that you can answer the advocated points from your perspective, thus shedding light onto the issues given. It shall take quite a bit to read because I'd like to get through all the stuff mentioned as it presents utmost interest and high importance to me.  Here goes (until mentioned otherwise):   it's an opinion so why hold onto it?   Because it expresses the way I see the world. It may not be understood or accepted by everybody, but that's what I see the world as, and it's fine. We're all different, and it's more effective in relationship terms to accept that one person may have a different taste from another rather than try to stay opinionless (which is impossible, so why go there?).   I can just let it go. It's barely important.   Some opinions will be irreconcilable, which is a truth of life and, therefore, just as fine; I'm not going to tune in with the rest of the humanity, as it is impossible, - I want to be myself. Thus, it is the opposite of being barely important: it's something that defines me and should be at my disposal whenever I have to evaluate the situation emerging. There is no ""right way"" to do things, only the way you see as the right one, so why bother pretending that I'm nothing when I, for myself, am everything?   Usually the only reason to value and compare is to find the way in which we are special, notable or superior.   To assign value and to compare those assigned is the basic of evaluation, which every person is ought to be able to do lest they want to spend a life of a slave, mental or physical, to other people and their ideas. It is how you choose what's best for you, as well as for other people. Thus, be you selfish or selfless, you have to know what's good for you and what's not, and value is the material upon which you build judgement.  Why is judgement important? Same reason: to be able to choose the best in the situation. In fact, judgement as a function requires value as an input - otherwise, it's an empty function, doing and being able to do nothing. If we do not judge, we do not choose, - then somebody makes the choice for us, which never leads to happiness unless you're honestly happy when following somebody by the leash.   You can see selfishness in other people because you know what it feels like to be and act selfish. You read guardedness and manipulation in others because it is what you practice.   Does that not mean that I have the right experience to figure out whether the person in question is selfish? It seems to me that to find one takes one, thus, I possess the perfect tool to identify selfishness and, for my own good, avoid it and find other people, those less selfish, to learn from them.   I think people have more success with it when then approach it as mindful meditation   This will make any conversation a mental exercise, which means I'd be working my brain out every time I speak with somebody. As an introvert, I already have hard time coping with as much social attention as society I'm in (not talking about the whole world, but rather about first- and second-world countries).  This practice will probably make me even more insecure, as now I have to figure out what to say and how to understand every said word and the sentences whole - or it will make me an unbearably annoyingly slow with every conversation I have. People I'm very close to might learn to tolerate that, but the general public will not - why would they bother to fit into one person's way of thinking and talking?   The purpose is to find authenticity in yourself so you don't have to constantly be comparing your inner and outer worlds   We can't be the same people for everybody-on-the-street and people closest to us: there's always going to be a mask on your face whenever you're not at home (whatever that means for you). The reason this is going to happen is because we're all so fragile inside that even a tiny scratch on this sensitive braid that is our inner world, and that scratch will come inevitably when you're as open to strangers as you are to the closest to you. We're all different, and what might seem innocent and harmless to another person will be toxic to yourself.  Here finished the devil's advocate run. Now I want to talk about other points you've made.  I believe I understand what you mean by interrogating thoughts. I've learned of this concept - under a different name - quite a while ago and was able to invoke it at will, yet my mind goes back to racing thoughts around without me noticing. It seems to be a normal state to me to think about something constantly.  Just as back then, I think it's not always bad to go on with your inner dialogue: it may reveal gems that the subconscious contains, unknowingly to us - memories that help solving a problem, brilliant ideas fitting greatly into a story, things like this.  Still, I do find this dialogue-less state of mind peaceful and quiet and believe that it helps me, even if I don't notice it. I shall it give it more effort to not think when I don't have to and see where it leads me.  The concept of applying meditation state of mind onto conversations and everyday life is very appealing to me. It seems to be something I've been looking for for a long time. The trouble I'm having is with understanding the underlying principles of such thinking: I work best under a defined set of rules, which applies itself to the thought processes as well.  Is there a practical way to find such a set? I would certainly require outside help in the matter of the rules, since I'm only vaguely aware with how a mentally healthy, confident and mentally strong person thinks. Thus, finding a compiled list or a text from which I can compile such list myself seems essential for this.   Surrounding yourself with beautiful people is just an insecurity   I don't think this is what applies to me. I may be wrong, of course, but I believe it's a matter of personal preference rather than social dynamics.  In other words, while I might enjoy a company of a person of the opposite sex (no point hiding - I'm a guy, so that means girls) with the same circle of interests and similar passion for those, I gravitate, somehow, towards girls that are attractive physically rather than mentally, and even then the apparent beauty might be vain.  I don't know how that came to be. I do know that I appreciate physical beauty to a certain extent, but I also know this ""physical"" interest might fade away once I came to know the person - of all sexes - and found out that I can spend good time with them (which usually means talking about stuff we share interest for).   Maybe your authenticity lies somewhere that people shouldn't be comfortable around you because you don't want to be a selfish 'nice guy' any more satisfied with the status quo   Could you explain what that means? I don't follow."
DecidingToBeBetter,2zpehv,sihtydaernacuoytihsy,2,Sat Mar 21 14:07:17 2015 UTC,"I understand.  Focusing on your separateness, your definability, your opinions, your evaluations, your ability to judge and make decisions, your ""special snowflake""-ness is what is keeping you isolated from other people. If that is what you've conditioned yourself to do 24-7-365 I'm not surprised you're having social trouble. You need to balance that with some '""I just accept that thing, person, experience for what it is for absolutely no reason what-so-ever just because it exists, and just by existing, by gosh, it is the truth."" Because some things are really just like this. Your reason has clouded your intuition. You don't need to 'figure out' if someone is selfish if you were at ease with your intuition, it is something you would sense and you wouldn't feel so vulnerable socially which would make being around people a lot easier for you.  I don't mean that you should practice meditation while in conversation. It's something you can do for yourself to help you take inventory of your self judgment and help you get past it. You'd have to get pretty advanced to apply it to someone else's mind pudding :( But if you want to make that a goal, awesome.   Part of your problem is probably the reliance on rules and process. I love them too, so believe me, I feel your pain and it is not good times drawing a map to bring together the two worlds of structure and intangibles but if you can learn to just settle into the motion of the intangibles, it makes the structure more stable and it gives your forward thrust so much more power.   It's like driving a car. You know the vectors and the values and you could do all kinds of calculations to quantify what you're doing, but you don't because, well, you're driving. The car calculates speed and distance for you anyway without you even thinking about it, so don't think about it.   Meditation is really just about not thinking about the things you don't have to think about. The reason you have to learn to do it is that we occupy our minds thinking about garbage so you need to de-clutter. You don't need to have an opinion about everything. Apply your mental juices to things that really matter.  Don't hold on to ALL of your memories, some of them are really limiting. Not everything has to be better than the last time, HINT: it never is. Not everything has to be improved, some things are good just the way they are, just enjoy them. Whatever or whoever is in your environment whenever that happens to be, learn to enjoy that, regardless of the quality of it or your preferences. Maybe you like a lot more different stuff than you realize.  As for the nice guy comment, not wanting to rock the boat or hurt people's feelings or say what you're feeling, to me, is selfish. There is a limit on being polite, I'm Canadian and I say that wholeheartedly. Some things just need to be said, and authenticity is about being honest. If you have so many opinions and have so many preferences and can judge with so much discernment about who you are, talk about it. If you can't, then you haven't tested your character in the fires of other people's judgment so your decisions are probably crap anyway. The point is, yes, you CAN take off the mask. Nice guys are the guys that sit there and do nothing while assholes force their attentions on girls who aren't interested; nice girls are the once that sit there and giggle. Nice guys are the guys who laugh uncomfortably when jerks tell racists jokes at work and do nothing. Nice guys judge that things are wrong and decide to stay comfortable because that is their preference. That got a little ranty, I apologize, but you asked... I used to be 'nice' but when I started looking at what I was thinking when I was around other people, I realized I wasn't. Not really. I was actually a smug, superior, judgmental ass. So I started to change and it meant breaking a lot of my own rules and processes that worked for me before just fell away, I guess. I 'think' about stuff less now and I am more free to just do what feels right. I'm so much happier and so are the people around me, for sure.  edit: I might not have addressed everything point for point but I hope it covers the content of your query."

But the rest of the time, cut to the chase and go after whatever you're seeking. Friendships fall apart as you age and develop different interests--no judgment on former friends or on you required. (Missing old friends is normal.) Want more friends? Find clubs / activities / sports etc that you like. Join and be nice to people. (You don't need to be a saint, just be half-charming and kind.)   Wanna get over your tender, fragile ego? First, know that you're brain still maturing (if you're in college, you're probably about 20), and this will take some time; the part of your brain responsible for social cues isn't done cooking.

These are some things that worked with me, so hopefully you can utilize some of them!  First step is to get to the library! Make the library a place where you study and do nothing else. Do not go on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Youtube, Netflix, whatever. Put your phone on silent, and start reading the textbook. Train yourself that the library is a place for studying only. DO NOT try to study at home/ in your room. No matter how much you try to convince yourself that you dont need the library, you and I both know that nothing is going to get done at home.  Get into a routine. Set aside a few hours everyday to sit down and go over notes. Consistency is key here! Ideally you would do this immediately after your classes, but as long as you are consistent about the timing you will eventually develop a strong study habit.  As I alluded to in the previous tip, try going over notes immediately after the class. Even if you just take 5 minutes while eating lunch to re-read what was discussed in class, you will become more familiar with the material and will be able to remember it much easier the next time you use it.  Form a study group! The people in your group dont even have to be the same major as you. As long as you all follow a similar routine, it is much easier to check up on one another and make sure that you are committing to your routine and getting work done.  Hopefully some of these help! I didnt have much time to type this so its probably ridden with typos and grammatical errors. If I think of any more I will update the list. Good luck!"

Im naturally disorganized (either that or I just wasnt raised right... Probably a combo of both).  Im much better than I was though.   I think the hardest part is beginning.  And stopping.  You have to know when to stop or you will burn out and never clean again.    Your basic most time consuming and important categories are kitchen, laundry, bills and meal planning.  If you get those under control you are doing well.    Get your timer out and spend some time in each category.  You can spend 5 minutes or 30 it doesnt matter- it has an impact.  But make sure to stop and move on when the timer dings.  That's the key. Progress not perfection.  That will get you started.  Good luck!"

For me, cleaning about 10 minutes a day is pretty good. But be careful not to let the dishes and laundry pile up.

Your future self will hate waking up to a pile of dishes and no clean bowls for breakfast.   Can't be bothered to put your clothes away or do laundry? It will take your future self longer to find that shirt in the morning or to find it too dirty to wear.   Procrastinating when you should be revising for exams or completing coursework? Your future self will hate being unemployed or getting terrible grades.  Same goes for organisation. It all saves your future self time and energy so just do things as soon as you realise they need doing and gradually your future self will begin to like your past self.

Even take a picture and keep it there for a visual reminder of how it should look.  Sustain - keep it looking like your picture 100% of the time.

DecidingToBeBetter,2zj86j,5iMbA,16,Thu Mar 19 00:47:15 2015 UTC,"I feel I should start by saying just because someone has a major flaw doesn't mean they are a toxic person. If someone can recognize or admit their own faults, and work to improve upon them, you may have a friend with whom you can be better together.   But, I trust you are able to identify truly toxic folks on your own, so here is my humble advice.       Make a list of priorities that are unwavering to you. What qualities must you personally have that will make you the best person you can be? Now, what type of people would be detrimental in achieving those personal goals? E.g. If you want to quit smoking, you should probably remove yourself from smokers. It may be hard at first, but it is necessary that you set boundaries and say ""no, thanks"" to bad influences.   Now that your time is not wasted on people that do not matter, you must fill that time with positive influencers. Where will you find those you'd like to emulate? People making good choices may be at the gym, part of a service/volunteer organization, or some other hobby or event you hear about through work or school. Go to these things. Meet those people. Form bonds with these guys and gals and you'll start to notice you have better friends to hang out with.   Finally, don't be afraid to have some alone time. Being able to reflect on yourself is often times just as important as meeting new people, and it is much better than spending time with toxic people. So, find healthy habits to preoccupy your time with when you can't hang out with those you want to emulate.   Edit: I hit submit before I was ready to publish."

I was exactly the same as you, particularly with maths, but looking back now at the discrete maths we did in college it seems manageable, and with regular practice you'll get better.   I failed discrete maths 1 the first time around, the second attempt I scraped a 2.2, after that I went on a steady diet of an hour of math a day (usually through kahn academy and my text book) and for discrete math 2 I got a 1st. Persistence and determination is most definitely the key.  Programming concepts that had me questioning my mental ability for months at a time in college seem straight forward now, in some cases even obvious.    FYI - I graduated 8 months ago, and I got my first proper programming job 3 months ago.  You can do it if you put in the effort.

When you were less skilled, you thought that you were better than you were. Now that you're gaining skills and realizing that certain things are fairly difficult and that you have a lot to learn, you're thinking that everyone else is doing better than you are. You're comparing yourself to those who, for whatever reason, are doing the best, and realizing that they're better than you in at least some way.   Meanwhile, there are others who struggle more than you do. And those who don't appear to struggle might be more intelligent than you are, or they might be working harder, or they might not actually be catching on, or they might have previous knowledge which helps them understand certain concepts more quickly.  Whatever the case may be, the best thing for you to do is to keep trying and pushing yourself. Keep in mind that if you aren't pushing yourself and doing something that's hard, then you're wasting your fucking time in school. It's supposed to be hard."
DecidingToBeBetter,2zgvta,psychoconductor,7,Wed Mar 18 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"I have done my best to improve myself over the past years and have come to some conclusions that I'd like to share with you.  First, don't worry about IQ. Stephen Hawking said something along the lines of ""People who boast about their IQ are stupid"".   Second, don't worry about others around you. They are struggling and stumbling through it same as you. If they tell you they've got it all figured out they are lying.   Third, figure out what you need to do to succeed and do it. If you're having trouble grasping material, ask for help. Your colleagues, fellow students, teachers, whatever! Ask those successful how they do it and I'm sure they would be more than happy to share it their techniques with you over a cup of tea/coffee.  Fourth, memorization is NOT what you need to do to get by. You need to do more than that. You need to know the material and that takes practice and doing it over and over again. Once you think you've done that, try to explain it to someone else who has no idea what you're talking about.  Some other things that have done wonders for me:  Exercise regularly, even if that means just going out for a walk for ten minutes. Exercise increases blood flow to your brain.  Eat well, and eat right. Eat enough for your particular body type and activity level, there are loads of websites dedicated to this sort of thing. The point of this is to make sure your body isn't lacking any nutrients that it needs for cognition. Take a multivitamin!  Sleep. Holy shit, get sleep. Make sure you get enough otherwise you will be totally fucked. Lay off the alcohol/weed especially at night because it fucks with your sleep patterns. It's fine to partake in those things in moderation, but make sure you get enough sleep and go to bed/wake up at regular times. I know it sucks, but it'll be worth it. Even if you change nothing else and ignore everything else I've said, do at the very least this.   Good luck and don't give up!"

OP feels inferior to the people around him who seemingly have a higher IQ than him. Apart from that, isn't it also paradoxical to tell someone not to worry so much about their IQ, and then follow that up with a quote from someone who possesses a very high IQ?

DecidingToBeBetter,2zgvta,theazninvasion68,3,Thu Mar 19 07:12:45 2015 UTC,"Oh Boy... Prepare for a wall of text. The most relevant and important part is the top section. The bottom section is extra reading material to help stimulate your mind and give some perspective on the learning process and my post. Totally optional, but I'll leave it there.    Don't think of learning as ""memorization and rote learning""  Unless you're doing something that requires that...which boils down to learning new languages.   Think of learning like a toolbox. The things you learn are ways you can adjust, fix, and adapt your current understanding about certain things. For example, learning a new concept in math isn't just to solve problems specifically to that chapter, its to learn how to solve these types of problems, so you can go solve more complex problems later on.  Thinking ""This will solve X portion, and this will solve Y portion and I will have Z as a result"" is immensely more helpful than rote memorization.     There is a whole lot to learning, the process of learning, and definitions...etc. In fact, in my university, there used to be a whole class , in the psychology department, dedicated to how we Learn (and our cognition, and perception...).   Recently I've felt that my intelligence is limiting me.   There are a good number of theories of intelligence. My favorite theories are Fluid and Types of Intelligences. What does this mean?  In short,  Fluid Theory of Intelligence means that intelligence is fluid. You don't grow into a specific level of intelligence and thats it forever. It means that you learn things as they come to you, and lose them as you forget them. The best analogy I can describe is that your intelligence/brain is like a muscle. The more you use it for specific things, the better you will be doing exactly what you do often. This explains why Rote memorization works. It also means that you can always adapt yourself to your situation. If you're struggling to pass your programming or math class, you will eventually find a way to overcome this barrier.    The second one is Types of Intelligences. There is a whole lot of controversy about a few, but more importantly, It intuitively makes sense. Some people are great people-persons. Some are great at being outdoorsy. Some are great at abstract, logical things, and some people are great with handling emotions and expressions. To keep brief, it helps to think of it as ""I have my strengths and weaknesses. People have their strengths and weaknesses""  If you are continually having a difficult time with math, programming and you keep encountering yourself, saying ""I'd much rather this, that instead. I'm so much better at it"" Then perhaps math and programming isn't exactly your forte. For example, I really wanted to be a chemistry-type of guy. I loved it and love the science and cool things about it. However, I can't do the math, nor can I do the lab-portion very well either. After giving it a good couple classes and half a year, I decided I should re-evaluate myself and what I'm actually good at.   And besides this talk of intelligence, don't worry about IQ. Your intelligence fluctuates throughout your life and it isn't so important than you think it is. What is important is that you keep trying, figure out how you learn best, and execute.  As long as you got that, all you need is time and maybe an extra set of eyes, ears and hands :)"

What you want to do is improve your working memory and abstract reasoning. I'm on the phone now but if you want to improve you must take in account that you will have to train almost all your free time. As a few starting points I suggest n-back variants, mental chess, LOTS of physics problems, the harder the better, learning a very alien language like chinese, meditate daily, read philosophy and complex literature (Kafka, Borges or Cortazar for literature, Schopenhauer, Heidegger or Sartre for accesible philosophy) and spend your free time on /r/riddles and /r/puzzles.

DecidingToBeBetter,2zgvta,Push-Pull,2,Wed Mar 18 15:24:03 2015 UTC,"When I was in high school (many, MANY years ago) I had major difficulties with Algebra my freshman year. I struggled horribly to pass that class with a C average when I was doing AP stuff in science & physics. It was a major stress to me, as I knew that I was better than that. I did pass with a C, but only just barely. My sophomore year, I took Geometry and freakin' ACED it. As in, I was in the top 3 students in the class. There was nothing magical, I was just incredibly comfortable with it and excelled. But in my junior year, I was back in for another round of Algebra, and my struggles began anew. I tried, desperately, to get the teacher (who happened to be the same teacher as my first year of Algerbra) to help me and explain it, but I just wasn't getting it. At all. Out of desperation, I went to my old Geometry teacher, as I knew that he also taught Algebra, but I wasn't able to get him that year. He sat down with me, and within 10 minutes, I completely understood what I hadn't before. I started going to him for help when I needed it, and I wasn't struggling nearly as bad. I passed with a high B because I now could understand what I was doing and not brute forcing my way through it.   Now, the main thing is that I passed and understood the concepts better. But I learned something else as well. Nothing is outside the range of your knowledge if you have the resources to help you understand the concepts in a way THAT YOU UNDERSTAND. From that point forward, if I wasn't 'getting' something, I found someone/something else to help me with it.   TL;DR: It may not be you, you may just need the concepts explained in a way that you understand."

Mindful breathing (paying attn to your inhales and exhales) brings you out of fight or flight and into rest or digest. This shift from the parasympathetic to the sympathetic (I really hope I didn't misspeak, notes are downstairs) allows your immune system to turn back on."
DecidingToBeBetter,2zgzgo,hopeless_n_confused,5,Thu Mar 19 17:14:35 2015 UTC,Same page. Not as long as you but for basically my entire life until recently.   I'd say you're already on your way. My first step was realizing it. After I realized how I was I realized how it affected my day to day life.   I guess I lost my anxiety when I really did start liking myself. I still have moments but for the most part I'm happy with who I am.
DecidingToBeBetter,2zgzgo,GUY-WHICH-LAUGHS,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:50:09 2015 UTC,"How did you proceed from when you found out? I am trying to look at how it effects my day to day but I'm not sure if there is anything it doesn't effect to some degree.  I am in the same boat you were with the not liking myself at all, I always feel like everything I do is wrong and I apologize constantly, I have always hated that because I do it when I know the other person is in the wrong.."
DecidingToBeBetter,2zgzgo,GUY-WHICH-LAUGHS,7,Thu Mar 19 02:55:00 2015 UTC,"Think about it like this.   What has happened is the only thing that could've happened. If you fail at something it does not provide any value or definition one way or another to you as a person. It does provide experience though which without doubt will make you better one way or another, if you let it. If you use a failure as a learning point instead of another opportunity to get down on yourself then you are constantly getting better. You can't lose.  Go ahead and apologize if its right for the moment. Never apologize for who you are though; thats what I did. I'd say sorry this is how I am, sorry I have these anxiety issues, etc.   I just typed a post about my experiences the other day. I don't know if you'd want to check it out, it's long. But it boils down to this, I was my own worst enemy and I think you are yours. What you need is to develop an unshakable dedication to yourself."

Thank you for opening up to me, I don't have PTSD in the sense that so many soldiers do but I used to work with loads of military (all branches) and when they would open up to me about some of their problems I could always understand the anxiety they felt when they told me stories about what they saw and so on. I appreciate your words of encouragement more than you know."

DecidingToBeBetter,2zgzgo,takatakatakatak,2,Wed Mar 18 16:09:52 2015 UTC,"I found slogan training to help with the anxiety and beating myself up.   Have to find something short that works for you and use it as a pause before or during.  This helps you to identify how you physically feel when shamed or anxious.   Then hopefully you can start to catch it before it spreads.   ""Patience"" & ""practicing"" were good for when i got frustrated or screwed up.   ""Eso si que es"" (s.o.c.k.s.... it is what it is).   Was and is a big one for when I'm disappointed and need to accept what is happening.    Good luck to you."

DecidingToBeBetter,2zdz1c,ThinkEpiic,33,Tue Mar 17 20:04:24 2015 UTC,"You have to stop what you are doing some times, even if it makes you feel good. You need to ask yourself, ""What is the most valuable use of my time right now?"" I'm going to repeat this. Write it down. Print it out. Whatever you choose. Embody this question... ""What is the most valuable use of my time right now?""  Most people are not paying attention to that. They think ""life is just the way it is"". It's not like that. Life is the way YOU create it. It is what you do with your time that shapes your future. What you do now reflects on tomorrow. You have to carry that into tomorrow, and people just have to understand that.  If you are in your phone all day and are chatting up a storm, you are not getting to where you know you want to be. You are taking too many pit stops. What is the most valuable thing you can do right after you finish watching this video? ... Hold on... I had to stop, because I needed to share this. I'm currently putting together a project that I'm going to present to you guys. I'm writing out my goals. I write an idea out every 2 - 3 hours. It gets so cluttered in my head, I just have to get the ideas down. Some times I voice record. I just used myself as an example for you. You need a change of pace some times. Whatever it is. Go for a walk. Sometimes your head thinks you need to watch YouTube, but your body needs to move.   It seems days are going fast lately. You chill for a minute, then it is night time. You want to wind down. Why are you winding down, if you haven't done anything productive that day. Did you help someone? Have you taken care of your health? Did you do something to earn money? Have you helped your children with homework? Did you do something for your significant other? What reasons do you have to be tired if you've done nothing?  The key is not really so much time-management to me as life management. It is just paying attention to your activities more than managing your time. I've done the index cards and mapping out my day. It doesn't really work for me that way. I have to ask myself, ""What is the most valuable use of my time right now?"" Some times I question if I should even be doing these videos at times. I have to stop and go focus on something else I know I have to be doing.  Lock in on what you need to be doing to get you farther. One of my favorite books that has really helped me is The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. It goes into the psychology of why we do what we do and helps you break it down. I'm not a book guy who reads books and teaches them. My thing is to get to you directly.  I feel stupid trying to go through a book and read, read, read and show you what it does and stuff, when still have a problem with waking up at 7AM in the morning. You could not get up at 4AM to save your own life. You haven't walked around the block in years. You won't even eat an apple a day. We have to get that stuff right first. People ask, ""Jae, what kind of books do you read?"" It's not really too important what kinds of books I read. I only read books for the moment in my life that I am experiencing.  Some people are not even ready for books yet. That takes a whole other type of discipline. It takes discipline to read and actually finish a book. We could instead just go back to the root of the situation. Get all of the clutter out and get directly into taking action. Jump out there without caring what happens. Do the most valuable things at the time; that should get you the right results. Value. Results. Give value get value. Give results get results.  That's all I want to present to you guys today."

DecidingToBeBetter,2zdz1c,anonymau5,3,Wed Mar 18 02:32:15 2015 UTC,"A better way of thinking is, it's better to start somewhere, because if that first idea is not valuable, then you can at least narrow it down. Then start again. Until you find the right use of time. When the time comes, you'll realize that those first ""non-valuable"" uses of time were actually giving you more knowledge and experience as to what you've learned is valuable to your time along the way."

I moved back in with my parents after college for about six months until I got a job and moved out, and it was six months of hell.  My stepdad is an overbearing dickweed (forgot about that until I moved back in), they're both fighting with each other constantly, stepdad treats me like a teenager (despite being 25), parents watch so much TV it's disgusting, just a long laundry list of things I hate.  Not to mention that apartment is like, maybe 500 sq feet.  Three people in a space that small?  Hell.  Soon as I moved out, a thousand times better.  No more curfews, no more overbearing, no more having to walk on eggshells or put up with that insipid noisebox (I fucking hate television, in case you can't tell).

DecidingToBeBetter,2zhan2,trisharose,2,Wed Mar 18 16:37:41 2015 UTC,"From what I've learned so far, it won't work unless you want it to. Not ""wish it to"", mind you: there's a very important difference between the things those words mean.  When you wish to have something, you're dreaming about it in any sorts of ways. When you want to have something, you're dreaming about it - and you do what it takes to acquire it.  Because of that, you have to ask yourself: do you wish for the manifest to work, do you wish it made you what you wish to be, - or do you want to work on yourself with as much strength, mental and physical, as it takes to become what you want to be?  If it's the former, you might as well throw the manifesto in the trash bin. It won't do any magic onto you so that you'd feel better about yourself. Maybe you're not ready for this next move yet, or perhaps you just don't give enough shit for your ideals to stick with you.  If it's the latter, - persevere, my friend. Following ideals is hard, no matter what you write in the manifesto, and it might very well drain you mentally for a while as you get used to unexpectedly high standards you may or may not suddenly put on yourself with that piece of paper.  As for what to write there... David Cain of Raptitude.com said a simple yet one of the most profound things I've ever heard: we, humans, generally suck at following our plans, dreams and other sorts of wants and wishes - and it's alright. We want to think of ourselves as ideal creatures who're capable of sticking to the last letter of the New Year resolution, and we project same image onto others... yet we don't follow through our own little list of what seems most important to us - because that's what we are: humans.  We all start weak, so don't punch a mountain and expect it to break: nobody likes broken arms, especially our willingness to follow ideals. It is fragile, and only gets stronger through training, because it is, like almost everything about ourselves, a skill. Punch something smaller, less dense first: start with one idea, one habit, one action that you want to stick with you, but follow through with it for as long as it takes. As soon as you find yourself staying with that thing, take up the next thing and work on it for as long as it takes."

DecidingToBeBetter,2zdexz,nashife,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:59:19 2015 UTC,"Tasks is optimized to make lists and integrate them into your calendar and emails. I don't use it very much, so I'm not the right person to go into more detail on Tasks. I personally find it doesn't fit into my life very well.  Keep is more like a super flexible scratch-pad where you can write notes to yourself in any format you want (lists, blurbs of text, pictures, audio, etc).   It also lets you turn the note into a reminder that will ping you at a time you want it to.  I personally use Keep way more than I use Tasks.  I like its flexibility, and I like that it's not tied/dependent on any other google product the way tasks is.   More often than anything else, I just need a place to write stuff down real quick and have it remind me of it in 6 hours.  I can put random ideas for fiction, ideas for assignments for my students, reminders to buy things on my way home, and to-do lists all in one place."

DecidingToBeBetter,2zdbh1,Ballsy12,4,Wed Mar 18 00:50:10 2015 UTC,"The way I dealt with it is by remembering that failure is human. Making mistakes is completely normal, think of how many things you could screw up everyday but you don't.  Also remember that sometimes mistakes causes change. It helps you become aware of something you've done wrong and helps you remember to never do it again.   So maybe instead of thinking ""I suck, now everything sucks"", start thinking ""I didn't make the same mistake again, yay!"".  Just be grateful that you are not like the helpless people in infomercials."

DecidingToBeBetter,2zdbh1,hi_libido,1 point,Wed Mar 18 03:29:42 2015 UTC,"I have a similar problem that I only recently started to try and solve. A few months ago I began seeing a therapist to help work through thoughts/emotions/reactions going on in my own head (though I stopped upon moving to a new city), and I highly recommend that if it is an option for you.    One thing that has helped is to see a change you want- in this case not beating yourself up over small things- as a long-term goal. Do not put a time pressure on it. It took a lifetime to create a tendency, and it will certainly take some time to dismantle it.  This can help to lessen the feeling of urgency, which may result in a negative feeling.  A second thing I have found myself doing is thinking ""will this matter in ______ (a given time frame)?""  If I mess up at work, I think ""will this matter in 2 weeks?"" It rarely does. Will it matter in one year?   Finally, just try your hardest to resign yourself to the fact that you make tons of mistakes and can do things wrong, and it is okay. You are human. Every single one of us makes mistakes. Do you look at the small mess ups/mistakes your friends and family make and keep score and judge them? Do their small mistakes change your opinion of them? Chances are they don't, so why change your opinion of yourself based on yours?"
DecidingToBeBetter,2zdbh1,derpfreely,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:12:29 2015 UTC,"These are all really good suggestions, but I'll site what my therapist had me do: Forgive yourself.   It's kind of a weird thing to say or think (it was for me) but it helped because I was genuine with myself. I didn't use it was a joke. I didn't abuse it. I still held myself accountable, but when it came time to blame myself, I simply said ""I forgive me,"" and it allowed me to move on.   Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone falls into patterns. Those of us that are hyper-self aware can fall apart by these perceived patterns of mistakes. It's avoidable. You hold the key to change it.  Genuinely forgive yourself.   If you can't feel it genuinely and have a certain amount of sanctity for it, it won't work for you. You have to want it to work. And it will."

If you need more info pm me and I can share a bit more, my stuff is pretty personal so I'd rather not broadcast it. My life now as opposed to a few years ago is dramatically better and easier.

I've had friends leave my life by the two of us growing apart, suicide, and even murder. I've had to leave the lives of people I liked because in the long-term the friendship and circumstances of it was more damaging than holding on to that social tie. I'm learning to embrace the insecurity of the future by appreciating the now. I appreciate people in the past who I would have prejudged and not been interested in knowing previously. This doesn't mean we become great friends but is what allows for that possibility. That being said, I still get lonely sometimes when I'm alone but I've hung out with groups of people and had the same empty feeling. These days I'm determined to be healthier in all ways--mentally, physically, socially, etc.-- and, though it's a struggle, it's been very rewarding so far.  You're joining the military, assuming you don't die a horrible and violent death there will be so many people that enter and leave your life in ways that you have zero control over but you'll have forged an incredible bond with the ones that remain. Be open to appreciation."

I simply make sure I'm not too overly dependent on one or the other.   I just think too many people have this boogieman viewpoint of being alone. The 5 years I've spent by myself, I wouldn't trade for anything, because it's been during that period that I learned the most about who I was, what I wanted, what I needed to change, and who I was capable of becoming. It allowed me to learn to be ok with my flaws and my fuckery. Had I not had that time alone, I'd be a bigger wreck than I was before.   Best of luck on your journey friend ;)"

My girlfriend and I have both done alot of soul searching to get where we are now, alot of self improvement and hard realizations. But we've done all that by ourselves, only then did we find each other, when we were truly ready. And what's more interesting is that, there were multiple times throughout life where we could have met! Despite living in different states, we realized that we were constantly in the same places, at that same times. We went to the same summer camp, she was in my area every summer visiting family, Once even in the same building together during highschool! But we never met before we were supposed to. Before this year, and Before this time we had to work on ourselves, we agreed that we wouldn't have been friends based on our bad qualities and the way we used to be. But now, after this long process, we honestly couldn't be better for each other.   You're right, loneliness isn't a terrible thing if you know how to handle it. Most of the time, its just a segue into a period filled with friendship. Thanks again for the help."

The unknown can be frightening and daunting and its perfectly rational to feel that way.   I think the trick is to not get caught up on those feelings, don't let those feelings be the ones that drive your decision making. Make small goals on a daily basis for talking to 1, 2, eventually 3 or more strangers a day. Spend an hour focusing on a topic that purely has interest to you and you alone. Spend some time gaining a deeper understanding of things you already know about. Spend a little time building connections to old friends through social media (gchat, fb, etc.). Once you know where you will be deployed, start spending a small amount of time a day learning the local language.  In short, use this time to diversify and grow personally and two years from now you'll have turned all that lonely time into personal growth time and I promise, you'll be happier for having done so."

Just remember that just because you're no longer seeing friends/family/your gf as much physically, it doesn't mean that they've left you.  I know people in many different parts of the world now who I still consider friends and who I know think the same of me.    We are lucky enough to live at a time where talking to someone on the other side of the world is just as easy as talking to someone that's down the street.  It might take a little more conscious effort on your part to keep those friendships alive, but it's your choice whether you do it or not.  But trust me, you will feel so much better if you do.    But don't categorize friendships by who's permanent and who isn't, life doesn't work that way and there's no way you could ever know who would fit into which category.  If you like interacting with someone, send them a message.  Don't think any farther past that interaction: you'll just drive yourself crazy."

My psychiatrist does require that I get bloodwork done every 3-4 months because, while rare, Depakote can cause liver problems.  My point: There is a chance you may, at some point in your lifetime, be put on a med that requires some monitoring. If that comes to pass, ask your psych to help you with some coping mechanisms. Also, ask the phlebotomist for a butterfly needle or pediatric needle. They are a smaller gauge and make for a better experience, at least accordingly to my adult daughter, who isn't fond of needles."

My psychiatrist's office just recently started doing that with everyone; they wanna make sure we're not taking anything that could interact badly with the meds, which makes a lot of sense to me. And though he didn't say it, I figure they're testing some people to make sure that they weren't over-taking some of their meds too, lol.  I wouldn't be surprised if they had an incident not too long ago, either. Especially after one of the PAs they had working in one of the offices briefly (I had an experience with her and she seemed kinda haphazard in the way she was handling prescriptions.)"

A psychiatrist is also a medical doctor who will know how to supplement your therapy with the right medications."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z8qct,plimbaugh,10,Mon Mar 16 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"Ok so I'm going to tell you something you may not like but it's important to hear and there are some things you need to know.  The 100%, most absolute important facet to therapy is how comfortable you are with/how much you like the therapist.  The science of psychology often has little to do with it, especially in conditions like depressive disorders and generalized anxieties.  If you don't like the person you meet tomorrow, find another person to talk to.  It will of course have some awkwardness talking to a new person but after an hour you can tell if you click with someone.  I've had therapy sessions that felt like I was talking to a rock, and I've had ones where I felt like I was talking to a person I've known my whole life.  I don't think I have to tell you who it was that helped me learn how to be social,  ""confess"" myself to people and open up to others.  But I'm telling you, when you find the person you click with, they'll start telling you things that make you feel like the world just makes more sense.  I can't guarantee that for everyone but IMO if you're not leaving there either with a better understanding or a better mood then try going to someone else.  So just realize that if you get there tomorrow and it kind of sucks that in all honesty that's kind of common and to not sweat it.  You'll get more out of one session with someone who you understand than you will a year with someone you feel like is preaching to you or that you can't connect with.  Knowing this can save you some time (and money).  Edit: It's worth noting that one of the things that impressed me most about therapy my first time is how many of them are in fact easy to talk to and admit scary things to.  It's pretty possible the first person you meet is just freaking awesome.  That's really one of the coolest things about therapists, it's literally their specialty to get people to trust and open up to them so it's a lot easier to find a great therapist than it is to find someone outside of therapy to open up to."

To be honest UK counselling differs hugely to how the usa does it, so some things might be different, but over here if they thought you were dangerous to yourself or others you would be referred almost instantly for a mental assessment first,due to the waiting times for counselling taking maybe three or four weeks, which depending on your state of mind you may not ""have"".  If no alarm bells go off with your first meeting with a doctor, and assuming this part is the same where you are    as I am, you'll be referred to a counselling institution and offered group or individual therapy, or both.  Edit: Suicide is not a dirty word just to be clear, you can mention you've encountered suicidal thoughts without the doctor hammering a button under his desk and calling the men in white coats, it all comes down to how likely they gauge you to attempt it before therapy. If it's paid you a visit in the past, tell them and just be honest about it."

I then did a lot more research and found someone that got me a ton of progress.  The problem, at least in the US, is that counselor is often a keyword for ""I've had a little training but can't legally call myself a therapist"" whereas a psychologist has had lots of education, often a Masters, and bills themselves as a therapist.  I Google Mapped up all the ones near me, made a list of names, then googled those and found one that had papers published and was a leader of psychology associations.  It worked out really well."

DecidingToBeBetter,2z8qct,randomgirl2993,3,Mon Mar 16 19:40:46 2015 UTC,"As far as the difference between psychiatrist/psychologist/counselor/etc...   A psychiatrist, the type /u/SuperExcitedForMars is seeing, is a doctor who will usually make medication the main course of treatment. A few will include talk therapy as part of your treatment, but most of the time the most talking you will do is just so they can get your symptoms well enough to prescribe the best medication. Most(not all, keep reading), in my experience, will talk to you for a VERY short amount of time and then give you one of a few ""best current medications"" for whatever they diagnose you with. If it doesn't work for you, or has side effects you can't handle, they will just keep trying new meds or different dosages until they somewhat randomly get the right the thing(hopefully). I do think, even though it's hard to find a good one, that there are a few who are very good and can help a ton. Also, even the not-so-good ones may still find the right meds or dosage for you. I don't personally like this approach(have tried a number of meds for anxiety/depression myself and a number of psychiatrists), but I do know quite a few people who take psychiatric meds and it has helped them a ton.   A psychologist is basically a therapist with a doctorate in clinical psychology. Sometimes they can be better because of the longer education, but it doesn't especially go hand in hand. There will usually have one specific approach to helping with your psychological issues(cognitive behavioral, psychodamic, etc). That's kind of up to personal preference and your own beliefs and a good one will explain how it all works.   A counselor/therapist can be a lot of different things with all ranges of education and training. But sometimes someone with a 2 yr degree can be the person who might help you, but the ones with doctorates just don't click for you. You might get lucky and find a good one on your first try, but other times it's a lot of trial and error with what you like and need.   As for picking one - I've never found a very good way other than occasionally getting lucky and finding one with enough reviews somewhere online to feel ok about. But there are good ones I've had that didn't have any reviews too. You can also try asking around in forums, subreddits, facebook groups, etc., for your area and see if you can get a recommendation, but someone who works well for one person may not for you, so it's still somewhat trial and error.   Personally, what has helped me more than any individual therapist(of any of the above three types) has been free group therapies, such as 12-step groups(there are 12 step groups for a lot more than just addiction). It can be hard at first, but you get used to it fast, and unless it's a pretty rare bad group, you'll realize that everyone there feels like a mess too and noone is judging you AT ALL. Something about the group dynamic is awesome, you'll make some friends you relate to, you'll have multiple people to rely on 24/7 if you need to call someone who understands, and you'll learn a lot of coping techniques you may not hear about anywhere else. If you have any questions about those groups(or anything), feel free to ask(PM is fine too - for anyone reading)."

For a while I felt comfortable enough to be myself since no one knew me, I was pretty popular too(not to toot my own horn). That was all very short lived, but in that time I did manage to meet my wife. After a couple years of being extroverted and not knowing where it came from, I started to revert back to my own ways, but she never left my side and has been very supportive through all my ups and downs, even 12 years later.  Honestly, I'm not sure how I got so lucky.  There isn't a single doubt in my mind that if we hadn't worked out like we did I'd be alone, 100 steps behind where I am.

DecidingToBeBetter,2z8qct,omgstop,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:06:28 2015 UTC,I don't snore but I don't sleep well. I go to sleep around 11:30pm and wake up around 4am since that's the time I'm used to getting up for work. Even after a long time of not needing to.  When I get depressed I sleep like a cat. I can tell not long after I wake up if it's going to be a good day. By good day I mean the blinds will be open and I don't sleep the day away. If it's a bad day I'll sleep 7am to 4pm easily and still fall asleep at night with no more problem than usual. I've done this for a straight week at times.

Now you can see that the brain is easily controlled by repetition, and it doesn't need to be bad or negative, like those examples above.. you can brainwash yourself into being happy, and focused  and successful..  All you have to do is always try your best, and always do what you're supposed to do when you're supposed to do it..  Its a placebo effect, where subconsciously you know deep in your heart you are trying hard, and that you are focusing, and it will make you feel soo happy.

I've been through this cycle so many times and I really want to stop.   My own research has led me to believe that I am highly dependent on women for validation and self-worth. If this is true it would explain some things. After all, when I'm single my brain says ""women are ignoring you! You suck! Do something!!"" and when I'm in a relationship it's all cuddles and sex and cute text messages so I have the validation... no need to do anything says brain.   This also makes me codependent because I believe I must keep my gf happy and available at all costs. This leads to more losing myself and smothering her.   The solution, I think? Try to get my sense of self-worth from myself and learn not to rely on the validation of others. I'm hoping that this combined with discipline will help me in the future."

This is such bullshit. A really good way to stop this is to be responsible for you rather than continue on the path of unaccountability by off loading this onto your partner. How about if you see you're getting fat do something about it. If you don't see it then the string of partners leaving will be a cue alongside getting out of breath.  You are responsible for maintaining your attractiveness to your partner not him/her.  For real though, can you run 1 mile comfortably? Can you squat your own body Weight?

DecidingToBeBetter,2z8e1l,PoorAuthor9,9,Tue Mar 17 06:10:53 2015 UTC,"I have had this issue in relationships, but I've realized that relationships are really what you make of them.   The Spectrum: Comfort and Empowerment  On one hand of the spectrum, a relationship can be a great ""comfort zone"" where everything is as natural and comfortable as being on your own. It can be a relationship with lots of cuddling, lazy evenings watching movies, hanging out at home, going out with friends occasionally, etc.   On the other hand of the spectrum, a relationship can be an empowering partnership where both individuals motivate and support each other to push their limits and to reach their maximum potential in terms of their personalities, capacities and talents. This would be a relationship where each individual pushes the other to do things that they want to but are perhaps somewhat anxious to. And while pushing them, the person supports them, provides encouragement and advice, and the comfort of having someone back them up.   What This Means for You  The ideal relationship will have both of these aspects. It is a relationship that provides comfort and acts as a ""safe haven"" while still regularly empowering and motivating both partners to grow their selves and their talents.   It seems that your problem is an over-expression of the ""comfort"" aspect of your relationship, and a subsequent eclipsing of the ""empowerment"" aspect of your relationship.   The good news is that each relationship can become whatever both partners want it to be. Rest assured that a relationship can certainly become whatever you want it to be; a relationship which empowers you and motivates you is something that is very attainable, and will enrich you for weeks, months, and years to come.  The bad news (kind of) is that it will take conscious, careful, and organized effort. Growing, nurturing, or changing a relationship takes time, energy, and careful and creative thought. It is something that needs both people to be involved and buy into in order to be effective. The bad news, therefore, is that it takes energy to get your relationship to be what both of you want. This is ""bad news"" because it takes work, but its nothing too much to handle, and it is often fun and exciting to work on a relationship together. When you see how much a relationship has matured and evolved because of conscious effort, man oh man, that's a great feeling.    Recommendation  I recommend talking to your significant other, and explaining that you value a relationship that motivates you and empowers you, and ask what they think. Take care to avoid blaming others, and try to approach it as an exercise with your SO in voicing what you both, together, want the relationship to be. Avoid describing anything as negative, rather focus on extolling why such an empowering relationship can be beneficial for both of you.   Here are some things that you could say:   I value our relationship very much, and I understand the deep influence we have in each other's lives. We have a unique opportunity to influence each other and motivate each other in our interests and goals. Have you felt like this as well? (This is good because it starts off the conversation affirming that you appreciate and value your relationship and each other. Then you use that appreciation and value to build on your relationship even more) I really enjoy working out and taking care of my body, and I value reading very much. It can be difficult to live healthily and read often in our busy lives. What are some things that you value? Would you willing to support me by reminding me to work out every Monday, Wednesday, Friday? Would you like to read with me and talk about what we read every Friday evening? (This is good because you share what you value, and ask them to share what they value, and then you can talk about how to support each other in what you both value. Another good thing is that you take ideals and values, and talk about how to put them into practical, concrete habits. It's good to start with talking about values, and evolve the conversation into making plans for steps X Y and Z that you can take)   Here are some things not to say:   I hate how we always sit around the house and don't do anything (I recommend against this, because you are criticizing both of you and the relationship, and demeaning the relationship by focusing on a single negative aspect. Even if you sit at home all day, I am sure there is still the sharing of love and fellowship, and saying this wouldn't reflect that) I don't want our relationship to be boring and make me a worse person anymore. We need to try to be more motivated. (Again, this is demeaning the relationship. Also, it isn't directly blaming the other person, but they will very likely feel personally to blame, and this can create lots of insecurity within the relationship. Also, the demand for motivation is a single-sided demand, and its better to come to any conclusions together) I feel like I let myself go when I'm with you. I'm just not motivated. (This is problematic because it will often lead to the other person thinking that it is their fault, and this can lead to lots of insecurity which can undermine a relationship)   Summary  Every relationship is susceptible to too much comfort and not enough empowerment. Thankfully, relationships are dynamic, evolving, and can definitely be nurtured into what both partners want it to be. Have a loving, happy, and exciting conversation with your partner about the values you both share, and how to reach your goals together as a couple.   Good luck!"

DecidingToBeBetter,2z8e1l,stevew14,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:11:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this well thought out reply, it's definitely given me some insight into my own relationship. I can see how the two sides (comfort vs empowerment) play out in different ways over the course of a relationship, and even how my girlfriend and I naturally gravitate towards one side or the other.  I really value how motivated she is, and she values my ability to relax (something which isn't always easy for her). I think that we each struggle with our own disposition this way, either working too much or relaxing too much, so it's great to explore ways that they can actually complement each other (and a good challenge to be able to see the ability to relax as an asset and not just a liability)."

HOWEVER, one of my big issues with this is that I'm afraid that I will die in an unexpected circumstance, and that some people I love will read my uncensored thoughts and either judge me, or feel bad because of how I privately feel about them. I don't want either of those things to happen.  Obviously this is a ridiculous thing to worry about. If I'm dead, I'm dead. I won't care when I'm dead. But I worry about it anyway. I worry about the feelings of people I care about probably more than a normal person would. Being the source of pain for someone I love is the worst feeling in the world.  So I ask: Do you, OP, or anyone reading this thread, go back and read your words? Does it help? Do you think it would be helpful if I wrote all my thoughts down, but then burned them afterwards so I could feel that I could be completely honest with myself whilst writing? Or do you think I should only write down what I will want to read in the future? Perhaps you feel that burning your feelings after writing them down causes them mean less because you're not truly owning them... Whatever your opinion is, I'm interested in reading it."

I reread the entries in the morning to remind myself, and at the end of each week to reflect on how things went. That has been very helpful for me in terms of seeing progress, and making adjustments. And reminding myself of why I'm doing these things in the first place.  I'm not sure if I want to keep this journal or not, but I have found the process of writing to be very helpful."

DecidingToBeBetter,2z9lmj,snowlune,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:13:36 2015 UTC,"I think it all depends on what it is you get out of writing. Personally, I never really read what I write, because for me the therapeutic aspect of it comes from just writing it down in the first place. I might read it as I go, but I use it as a tool to organize my thoughts and figure out what it is I'm really thinking about more than anything, so by the end I feel alot better already. However, I could see it being useful to you to go back and read it. That said, if you're uncomfortable with people reading what you have to say, then I think there's nothing wrong with burning what you wrote once you're done. If it's keeping you from being completely honest with yourself, than do it. IMO it's more important that your honest with yourself, it will be more useful to you that way.  edit: Don't by any means take my advice over anyone else's here. Find what best suits your situation and roll with it. I don't have any expertise in this field or anything lol its just something I've done that's helped me before, so I thought I'd share"

Focus on one part of your life you'd like to improve, and just to some tiny thing to make it a bit better today.  Don't let a day go by without doing some bit to make your environment, self, or situation a bit better.  When you think of something to do, try to do it immediately, without letting yourself think about it at all.  Eventually it will start to reinforce and doing things you don't necessarily want to do will start to be a habit."

What is the difference, between playing a good game, reading some good book or watching good movie? As far as you are not addicted, It´s perfectly ok to play games. If you are somehow addicted, you have a problem, but that is not linked with games at all, you can be addicted to almost anything.    So no, quick workout instead of video games will not make you happy for lifetime. It will make you happy only if that´s your goal.    For example, I would be really pissed of, if I would discover in my 50´s, that I missed all of those awesome games and I will never have chance in my life, to play them."

I think, for example, it's a better for you than watching some mindless TV show - at least you interact with a game, put your reflexes to the test, etc.  I think the point of this post is to not completely avoid the things you should be doing to maintain your quality of life by eating well, exercising, not procrastinating on the necessary things in life by using instant gratification.

Games are way more addictive in and of themselves and demand prolonged attention. They're almost too engaging, and they're unapologetically escapist.  You can read a book on a beach or while you travel. Even the longest movie is a pittance in time compared to how long the average game takes to complete. Games don't make you want to get up and do something, they make you want more of whatever carrot-on-a-stick they're offering."

Books are much longer than any movie, they are addictive, you can´t get your hands down from book (few times, I skipped start of my school to finish reading a book). And I don´t even start on series like Breaking Bad, How I met your mother etc. For example: my experience from playing Mafia 2 is exactly comparable with reading of Godfather from Puzzo. So the only thing i see difference, is how easy is to get into games, compared to books."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z7eta,runnerofshadows,5,Mon Mar 16 16:08:51 2015 UTC,"Alright this might be a bit of a long post, but I see you're making your points on many other people's posts, so I'll have to take exception with some of what you're saying.   First of all, I've wasted a significant portion of my life playing games. In high school, it's basically all I did outside of schoolwork and social life. In my first couple years of university, it was also a huge problem, as I had more free time so I'd play for longer. I quit at the beginning of last summer once I took up DJing and now will only play a couple of games of DOTA every week.   When you're saying that ""you can just as easily get addicted to books and movies as gaming"", you're objectively wrong - look at the relevant brain science. The reward systems in video games are much stronger than in books or movies. Movies and books are more 'time-sinks' than anything, with little addictive power. Video games on the other hand are able to 'hijack' your brain to keep you coming back for more, just as a drug does - you seek the dopamine reward of completing a quest/level/boss kill/etc. Moreover, depending on what you're reading, books can be a good source of applicable knowledge that you can bring into everyday life. Video games on the other hand rarely have this benefit.   The biggest thing to bring up here is that you should be trying to incorporate more activities into your daily life that pay dividends in the real world, not just deriving pleasure from them. For me, it's DJing and school work because there are practical avenues I can pursue in life by putting time into these things. Gaming doesn't offer that (and don't say ""oh I can become a pro-gamer"").   Sure, gaming can be a fun past-time, but far too many people take it to the extreme and allow it to, for the most part, dominate their life and influence them way too much.    Something that bothers me in this subreddit is, that there are few general things that people take as ""good"" (fitness, books, clean eating) and they try to do them no matter how they like it, with blind hope, that when they will follow these things, they will be happy. I just don´t believe it is like that.   What you say here is simply your opinion, and obviously you're speaking from experience. The good posts in this subreddit will contain information that are generally applicable to people across a wide range of personality types. For most people most of the time, personal fitness, reading, and healthy eating are beneficial and productive things to be pursuing. You simply have no ground to stand on when you're claiming that video games are just a matter of preference or are in any way comparable to 'real-life' activities such as the ones mentioned above. The fact that I may not like going for runs or the soreness I wake up with after a work out says nothing about the objective, long term benefits that such activities provide."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z7eta,WizardofStaz,2,Mon Mar 16 16:40:44 2015 UTC,"Not every game is that way though. I tend towards games where I can save/quit at any time - or can be played in approximately 10 minute matches if it's multiplayer.   That way I can get a quick game in, quit, and do something else.  And only poorly designed skinner box games try to keep you playing all the time. You mostly see it in those ""free"" games that use microtransactions and MMOs."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z7eta,rommie47,3,Mon Mar 16 16:43:28 2015 UTC,"Games are fundamentally different from books and movies.

DecidingToBeBetter,2za9m5,SuddenDeathMelee,2,Tue Mar 17 06:20:10 2015 UTC,"I have a problem with this too. One of the best things you can do is set a time limit for each task. Then, for each task, first do a 'rough draft' of your work, that is, do the bare minimum or 'enough'. For example, I'm a programmer and I always do a 'rough draft' of the code first to get all my ideas down and to have something functional (rather than elegant) to show to my boss/supervisor. Then I go back and look at the code and perfect it. This takes a looot less time then aiming for perfection first, I think because it helps to get the big picture of what you want and what you need to do to perfect it (I think this approach is analogous for writing and other creative endeavors). For things like cleaning (I obsessively clean and organize), I have a similar approach. Set your time limit and start with most important (cleaning dishes, removing suspicious molds from the bathroom, feeding the pets) to the least important (all my books have to be in alphabetical order, all these pencils need to be in rainbow order, why aren't these objects perfectly aligned), then STOP when your time is up. You'll find that everything will indeed be 'good enough'. But 'What about those pencils that didn't get color organized???'. Well, since I'm a neat freak, I LIKE organizing those pencils. So what I do is I save those perfectionist tasks for later when I'm feeling procrastinaty or unfocused, or maybe I don't know what else to do. It helps me focus and gives me a break (as weird as it sounds to take a cleaning break).  But the main point is: do the minimum first - aim for functionality and adequate completeness rather than perfection. And also tell the neat freak in you that you can always perfect it later, and more often than not, it takes less time to perfect afterwards than to try and get it the first time.  TLDR; Set a time limit. Prioritize Tasks. Aim for functionality before perfection. Perfect after you have everything else sufficiently done.   Hope that helps :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,2za8jo,ChangeIsHere,6,Mon Mar 16 22:26:09 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give you is not to try to do these things all at once.  I've tried unsuccessfully many times to change everything about myself in one go, but I can tell you from experience that is just setting yourself up to fail.  Having said that, some of these things are fairly straightforward - making your bed, doing your washing up and brushing your teeth.  But some, like cutting out dairy and sugar and stopping smoking, are more complicated and difficult and will take some time.  Take baby steps.  Start with one thing at a time, and build up from there.  Instead of saying no video games/internet/streams until you've achieved all these things, cut the time you're spending on it down - if you're spending more time in your day on guitar, reading and spanish, that will cut down the time you have to spend on it anyway.  Also, be realistic.  Most people maturbate!  Good luck!"

DecidingToBeBetter,2z8h6f,ribbondino,14,Mon Mar 16 14:34:29 2015 UTC,"Here's a suggestion.  Don't depend on your head, it's unreliable.  Make yourself a system, no matter how small, that will offload a todo item.  This will free up some ""gotta remember this"" space in your wetware to do other things.  For example, just make yourself a morning checklist and put it by the door.  Keys, wallet, homework, phone, feed cats.  Whatever.  That's one thing you've removed from chance.  Pilots and surgeons all use checklists for good reason.  See also David Allen (Getting Things Done) for details about why it's important to get stuff out of your head and trust your system."

The first few times you do something will be hell - you'll have to ignore the 100 'reasons' (really excuses) you have for not doing something.  After you start doing it though, you'll recognize the advantages and then it'll become something you look forward to.  It's hard to offer examples of exactly where to start because you don't provide too much info.  What are you fucking up?  What are you behind on?  What things are making you feel doomed?  What is overwhelming you?"
DecidingToBeBetter,2z8h6f,The_Pag_Man,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:21:01 2015 UTC,"I think I'm in a similar boat as you. I'm sorry I can't say anything about the narcolepsy, but I can try and help with the college stuff!  Last semester and even in the beginning of this semester I struggled immensely. I didn't go to class, didn't do my work, and I became extremely overwhelmed which caused me a lot of anxiety problems which made things even worse.  I've by no means fixed all of my problems, but I'm definitely on the right path. What really helped me get started fix myself was finding someone to help me. When you're really overwhelmed, it's extremely easy to forget that you're not alone, and that there are plenty of other people out there who have been in similar situations and that want to help you.   For me it was my academic advisor. I went to talk to her about my classes because she was worried about me missing so much, and I ended up talking to her about a lot of my problems. She assured me that I wasn't the first person to have these struggles and that it wasn't to late, and it never is too late, to get back on the right track. She sat down with me and helped me organize my schedule, and helped me email my teachers and figure out what I could do to succeed. Try and find that person who will be able to help you out of the hole. Do not be afraid to ask for help!  Also remember that the first step to fixing your problems is recognizing that it's a problem at all. With this post you're doing just that. Recognize your problems, and be willing to put forward the effort to fix them. It might prove to be extremely difficult at first, but once you get back into the swing of things, it will only become easier.  I hope this helps! If you have any other questions I can try and answer to the best of my abilities :)"

If you spend time watching tv or browsing the internet, turn it off. Sign up for a gym, take up a hobby.

DecidingToBeBetter,2z840u,dearnancy,9,Mon Mar 16 12:18:14 2015 UTC,"Please excuse the very long rambling reply in advance. I've replied to your essay with an even longer one. This is just quite close to my experience and I felt like sharing my thoughts about it. I'm 22 as well, and have been going through an extremely similar situation to yours (also doing an English degree).   I'm kind of at that stage where I just want to give up because giving up seems easier than trying to get better.   Believe me. It's your brain fucking with you. It's a bit of depression talking, and a lot of people feel this way. At least you are noticing it. It's a momentum thing. If you spend too long in a circuit of inertia and apathy, you get comfortable, lose momentum, and doing anything to challenge it and speed back up makes your brain go ""no! no!"".   You have to recognise, your brain's not doing that because it wants to protect you, or because it knows achieving bigger goals is actually pointless or anything like that. It's just trying to protect itself from drastic change (which the brain kind of hates physiologically, but can deal with - it does the same thing with dieting, quitting smoking etc. but you know those are all obviously good for you). Its main goal is to keep your body alive, and its been train to believe that this is the best way to do it. But it has been receiving skewed data.  Seriously, it's all about momentum. If you start doing little things, towards your goals - any goals you like - you'll feel better, eventually, I promise. At first you'll be plagued with negative thoughts and want to not bother because you don't think you'll succeed, or you're scared you'll lose interest again. And a million other things - that's what being really sensitive is like, I know, you're like a walking talking exposed nerve to this stuff.  What you do with those thoughts is, even with all that, ignore them. Like you would ignore a cigarette craving. Recognise you're having them, and let them pass (mindfulness meditation is all about this mental process, although I'm not particularly experienced with it). You're training your brain to deal with stuff differently, and changing its shape.   The thing is, in reality you might not succeed ultimately with goal x, or you might lose interest in goal y. It doesn't matter though. At least not right now. What you need to do before you'll be capable of succeeding and finding something you're passionate about is build better habits by just ignoring all the other shit. It's like exercise, for your brain. It's horrible but you push through it. Eventually you'll make gains. You'll change mentally, and the way you'll approach things will eventually be different, more dynamic, and you'll have picked up momentum again, and eventually, you'll actually start to enjoy challenges. You'll probably notice yourself 'thinking' better, sharper, wittier. Some people talk about a fog clearing.  As for the social anxiety: I think that your self-doubt and abundant concern about how other people think about you probably comes from, on some level, a lack of other stuff in your life for you to think about. Social validation is a constant for pretty much every human being, so when you don't have much else going on in your life (me for about a year recently) you end up with social anxiety because social interaction (or your circumstance-induced lack thereof) is all that's there to consider, and you obsess over it. But the thing is, a lot of your problems socially aren't anything to do with you as a person - they're to do with the fact you're not out actually meeting lots of people. People who have serious jobs, or practical university classes are sort of forced to engage with other people, and eventually they find people they can relate to. You don't really have this luxury right now. But that's nothing to do with you as a person.   The solution in my opinion is to, again, just keep working on your smaller life goals. Don't worry about being better socially, yet. Do a bit of writing, submit it, go and sit in some open mic spoken word nights. Even write up a CV/resume, set up a blog, whatever. Just anything. Pick some thing you'd like to do, and in spite all of the doubt that might pop up in your head, just do it, thinking as a little as possible about how it feels. And really don't worry about other people at this point.   The other people will fall into place when you gain more confidence in what you're doing. Social anxiety, especially when you think you're 'boring', often comes from not feeling like you have an identity. You'll begin to construct one if you're just doing stuff, even somewhat related to what you care about, and without having to read How to Win Friends and Influence People, or think about Grice's Maxims all the time, you'll notice that it's naturally easier to talk to people. You won't be James Bond, but you'll stop ostracising yourself so much and will be able to think of yourself as more of a 'normal' person (and therefore will present yourself as such to other people without even trying to). And the rest will fall into place more easily (although it still takes work)."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z840u,greenelephants,3,Mon Mar 16 13:48:08 2015 UTC,"Ok. I'll quickly give you my experience and then shut up, just to show you what I'm yammering on about. I went straight to uni after I finished high school. I'm good at rationalising and expressing myself (although apparently not succinctly) so I was good at English, History, anything that involved essay writing and breezed through that stuff. I had a lot of friends because I was exposed to a lot of people every day.  First year, second year of uni studying English were OK, but I didn't really make any friends. It's a different thing after school, and because English studying is quite solitary and doesn't involve group work, I let it fall by the wayside. I had a girlfriend who I'd met through my home friends, and I went out with her from 1st year to about the end of 3rd year. I felt like I didn't need friends, I had the ones from home, a few of whom were at university with me, so they were my 'uni friends'. We were still living at all of our parents' at this point (my hometown is half an hour from my uni city).   OK, so that was fine, but I wasn't really doing anything. I kind of wanted to write but I wasn't sure what. And really I was just extremely lazy.   My girlfriend broke up with me, and I moved up to a flat near the university. I started my final year. I started to realise that I was actually really lonely. My best friend had moved far away, I was going to as few classes as possible, and with my remaining friends I was arguing and feeling completely worthless around. And not doing much else. We actually went out to clubs a lot, but every single time I was getting wasted and coming home miserable because I couldn't connect with anyone I met, nobody cared about me, I was boring etc. I wasn't making friends - and on top of that, the end of uni was coming and I had no plan, I hadn't practiced writing nearly enough, didn't have a portfolio. I had one shift at a supermarket every weekend where I spent the whole time feeling absolutely worthless and miserable and like I was letting myself and anyone who had ever given a shit about me down.   But still, I wasn't doing anything, because, well, like you said, making a stupid effort seemed even stupider and more risky, and more of a waste of time even. I did a dissertation in one day, missed a bunch of deadlines and eventually crashed out of my final year, with basically no friends, and no prospects really.   So I spent a year or so living with mum and dad, or in my flat in my room alone, kind of wanting to be a writer, but not doing it. I got so depressed and lonely, and I knew it was all my fault too.   One day, though, I just started going out running in the morning. I didn't even care about losing weight, I'm pretty slim and not so bad in appearance really. I was just so fucking bored and wanted to do something, however minuscule, that I wouldn't normally do. And when I got in, I felt a bit better. Obviously endorphins have something to do with it. But what I felt was like: ""Oh, yeah, I can actually do stuff to improve my life. I don't need to plan it all out and analyse it.""  So I reapplied for university not long after. Since then, it has not all been sunshine and daisies, but it's getting much better, because I have slowly applied all the stuff I was talking about above. I took some articles that needed written for the university newspaper and magazines and just went and researched them and did them (ignoring the voice in my head saying ""These are pointless, you want to be writing fiction not journalism, you suck at this anyway"") and I got them finished and printed. Seeing my words physically there, in stands all around the big campus, was a huge boost. And that feeling inspired me to start submitting poetry, fiction etc to websites.   I haven't been properly published yet, or anything, but some of my stuff has been featured and I'm getting better at it. I'm starting to see writing as a viable career option, and my life as something I might actually succeed in or even enjoy. I'm making more friends, but at the same time realising how important thinking about myself is too. I'm getting straight As and could land a 1:1 degree if I keep working at this dissertation (which I am of course procrastinating from right now to write this).     The point is, I'm not Stephen King, or even stable really, but I'm much better than I was a year ago, and it didn't take some big life changing thing. It took small adjustments in attitude and few instances of holding my breath and just jumping on the water slide without looking. And I'm finding that I now feel like I have a lot of options, and am more motivated to go for them, as opposed to being stuck thinking that 'realisitically' I'll be pushing trolleys for my whole life. In reality, I have exactly as many options as I had before. But my brain is changing, and less and less I'm slipping back.  Anyway. Good luck. Sorry for the ridiculous length of this reply. You'll be fine."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z840u,greenelephants,4,Mon Mar 16 13:48:15 2015 UTC,"My grandfather was 50 years old making $75/day as a cab driver with no retirement savings, no emergency fund, just living day to day, literally. He figured he would just work until his time comes, but something clicked where this wasn't the way he wanted to do things anymore.   He went out and got a second job, and started slowly saving. He then went out and got a third job. The poor old man was 52 years old working 3 jobs and his health was definitely not improving, but he kept pushing.   Throughout the years, he kept working harder, and in the process gave up some jobs in place of higher paying ones. Don't forget, only a couple years prior he had no money.   70th birthday came around which was an important day for him. It was his day of actual retirement. Over the last 20 years, he accumulated over $500,000 in retirement savings through a low-risk, diverse investment strategy. 20 years ago, he didn't think he would see the day of actual retiring. He ended up moving to Florida and kicked back on the beaches for the rest of his life.    I know this story isn't really similar to yours, but the point of it is that you're still a very young person with a whoole lot of life left in you and if you work hard enough towards your goals, you'll get there even if you're in the lower class bracket.   My dad told me this story over and over and regardless if some of it isn't true or made out to sound better, it's my basis for figuring out life.  My advice to you is take things day by day, because you never know where you will be in 20 years. and even in 20 years, it's not too late to be successful."

I was in a situation eerily like yours, and if I could go back in time I'd implore myself on hands and knees to pray.  I'd smash holes in the walls, run a car into the front window, set the police station on fire.  I'd do anything to persuade myself to start praying in the name of Jesus and reading the Bible.

To me, you're on track.  Maybe not 'the fast track' but I never cared about that anyway.  You're at a life stage now where you STILL GET THE CHOICE to decide who you want to be.  If the person you would like to be is more social than you, or does more things than you do - then pretend you're that person - fake it until you make it.  Look online go to meetup.com and join a group.  There's 10,000 groups of all sorts out there.  Experiment with them.  You don't have to be a diehard anything to check out a group for it.  I went to a Wicca ceremony with the pretense ""I'm not Wiccan but I thought it'd be interesting to see"" and everyone was super excited to have me and explain why they're not crazy witches and sorcerers and it was a great experience.   As for a job - I've found that it's 100000x easier to get a job after you've already got one.  So I'd start at your local McDonalds, coffee house, or whatever.  It literally doesn't matter.

If you can use public transportation to get around, then try to get a job. Keep going with your online job, that is a good start! That can pay for your bus fare etc.... perhaps you can find additional online work while trying to find another job?   Once you get some savings and have some idea of what you want to do career wise, then try a community college. A ""real"" job would help you work past your social anxiety, and after a while college would be a good next step.  Good luck!"

Reading fiction, for example, is not going to be as stimulating for some personality types. Reading fiction requires simulating the story and details in the imagination, and imagination is a function that people use or is activated differently. Perhaps consuming imagination is not their thing. Perhaps using their imagination to create artwork is. Consumption vs production.   I would rather someone be an artist or explore the world through travel, than stay at home and read half a book per day about art or traveling. What's sad should be judged on a per person basis.   Statistically, yes, I wish people read more. But I think our shared issues are with learning and a failing education system than it is whether people enjoy reading habitually."

DecidingToBeBetter,2z5jcu,cory-balory,2,Mon Mar 16 12:23:55 2015 UTC,Congratulations! I decided to re-read the Harry Potter series recently and it feels so good to rediscover a world that had such a huge impact on me when I was younger. Happy reading and best of luck to you!
DecidingToBeBetter,2z5jcu,Obti34,2,Mon Mar 16 13:48:38 2015 UTC,"Nice! Reading is always so rewarding! it's nice to make time for it, even a chapter a night is great, though i do find it hard to put some books down after only a single chapter!  I recommend checking out /r/books for discussions regarding books you have read. They have a great community over there!"
DecidingToBeBetter,2z5jcu,rommie47,2,Mon Mar 16 13:49:15 2015 UTC,"I love reading, especially sci-fi. Unfortunately I rarely have time to read mostly because when I start reading, I don't stop. I can read all day and night when I get a new book. And it's happened before, went to bed at 5:30 in the morning and had to get up at 7 for work. So I try not to read unless it's the weekend or its the summer. School comes first, then my job.   My favorite series are the Lost Fleet series by Jack Campbell, and the Demon Cycle by Peter V. Brett. If you have a inkling for space combat or magic, look into those. Have fun reading!"

If you still care about them, make an alternate account, and keep the alternate account signed in from an alternate web browser. But for your main browser, keep the account that is only subscribed to subs that you are certain are making you a better person. If it actually takes effort to read or participate in those subs, you'll probably gravitate away from them in times of laziness and go back to your work."

DecidingToBeBetter,2z929u,venusinflannel,3,Mon Mar 16 17:19:33 2015 UTC,"I'd advise you to learn why the people you call refined like certain things. Once you've done that, you might just find that you also like those things.  For example, many people don't get modern art. That's because modern art is based around textures and flashes of light. Globs of paint, rough brush strokes, the like. Modern art is less about what's depicted and more about the medium used-- while traditional art is generally the other way around.   Researching English also helps. Learn to express yourself in a way that flows gently."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z929u,21stPilot,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"I think you need to pick one (to start with) area you want to be refined in - e.g. music or art - and brainstorm what you think you would need to know and ways you could research this information.  For example, I really like history of art and I've always been really grateful I was able to study that subject for a period - I would recommend finding a history of art class and going to that.   Imo, to be refined at a subject, critical thinking ability is also really important because you have to be able to move on from 'I like this' to what objective qualities a piece has whether you like it or not. A lot of things I initially don't like, I'm able to think about until I can connect with their perspective, that's different from mine, and that will change my opinion. Not always, but practice makes perfect.  A class is also good way to get a general knowledge of a subject, which is also essential because otherwise it will be much harder to recognise when a piece of art is aiming for something different or new.  What kind of things do you want to be refined in?"
DecidingToBeBetter,2z929u,jniamh,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:28:01 2015 UTC,"Specifically art history,wine culture,various forms of art (everything from graffiti to ballet) and liturature. I'm already quite there;I work at an art gallery and I read a ton (mostly Albert Camus) but I'm looking toward to mastering this stuff. :) I would like to be more immersed in social justice issues and more specifically, underground artists."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z929u,jniamh,2,Mon Mar 16 23:13:59 2015 UTC,"that's ...a lot. I'm jealous that you get to work at an art gallery.  I don't really have any further advice to give other than take a break from Albert Camus and read something else. Read social justice theory. (something I realised very quickly when reading some myself: very few, or so far for me no, classic social justice texts, are free of some really bad ideas even while having many good ideas about other areas where social justice is required. I had to learn to accept that the bad ideas didn't invalidate the good ones. It's very easy to get into an all or nothing mindset with social justice.)   I don't think authentic discovery and interest in underground artists can happen until you're familiar with and spent some time on the mainstream artists first."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z929u,andero,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"Depending on how you learn, check out The Great Courses. I have pirated tonnes of their stuff through torrents and have become quite ""refined"" in exactly the areas of which you speak. For example, there is a course on wine (and spirits, by the way). There is a course on art (specifically painting). And honestly, anything by Prof. Robert Greenberg is solid gold. There are also courses on literature from poetry to British or Russian and on specific works like Ulysses or the Aeneid.  It really makes a difference. I got a job selling wine. I can appreciate going to a fine-art museum now. I went to a concert where a friend introduced me to one of the composers he had dated and we spoke about the show; she asked me if I took music in university and I said no, it was just something I picked up in my spare time.  Not to preach, but refinement is not merely for a social show. When you understand a subject more deeply, you really can appreciate it (and often related materials) on a subjectively deeper level. All those people who think wine connoisseurs are bullshitting and question whether they actually taste pear or apricot, they just do not know. Once you refine your palette, be it sensational or mental, you can really experience what life has to offer in a fuller way.  As for social justice issues, oddly enough, I recommend stand-up comedy. Stand-up has, for some of the greats, becomes a philosophical territory for raising issues. George Carlin, Bill Hicks, Doug Stanhope, Bill Burr, older Louis CK, and some Joe Rogan (to a lesser degree) hit on major social issues.  Then, and I cannot stress this enough, think for yourself. Read, appreciate, and learn, but when it comes down to evaluation, think for yourself. Was Ulysses really any good? How do you actually feel about Bach's music? Does it chance once you take the time to understand Bach's time and place and his musical language? Mine did.  Cannot help you on ""underground artists"". You could start talking to DJs or MCs or whomever is involved in the creation of the artistic or scientific medium of interest. Just start asking about them and their work. They are mere individuals, people like everyone, and you can just walk up and talk to them."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z929u,pfannkuchen_ii,1 point,Tue Mar 17 05:13:47 2015 UTC,"Well, for exceptional manners, I'd recommend reading some etiquette books.  Etiquette has kind of a bad reputation.  All good etiquette really tells you how to do is manage difficult situations without unnecessarily ticking off anybody.  I'm not sure when or how people started construing this as ""hoity-toity"".  As for ""exceptional taste"", well, the problem with this is that there's no real good arbiter of this.  Good manners can be measured, or rather, the lack of good manners can be measured, in awkward silences and pointless shouting matches.  Good taste, well, can't.  That doesn't mean you can't expand your cultural horizons, though!  Find something you don't know much about and would like to learn about, and start learning about it.  Use the Internet.  It's super easy.  This will, I believe, make you more fulfilled and happier than trying to conform to some arbitrary notion of ""exceptional taste""."

DecidingToBeBetter,2z929u,milojoker,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:31:28 2015 UTC,"First I'd start with some etiquette training.  Familiarize yourself with setting a 'formal' table setting and knowing what goes where (Note: almost no setting is EVER going to be the 'full' formal setting).  Certain things are easy to learn but make you seem like you're not a bump on a log, such as: Start on the outside and work your way in with utensils.  Forks on the left, knives and spoons on your right (except for break or dessert utensils). Your glass lines up above your knife.    Second - practice and use some more 'refined' vernacular.  Instead of saying 'yo, what's up?' get in the habit of say 'Hi, how are you doing today'.  Expound on things that you talk about and experiment with how much you can say before it gets to be too much.  For example, instead of saying 'Chipotle is good' try something like 'I enjoy eating at Chipotle.  I think that the flavors are really outstanding.  They do an excellent job of adding just the right amount of spice to complement their meats.  The cool and refreshing toppings, like sour cream and avocado really bring the whole meal together.' Which may have went a bit too far but you get the idea.  I'd start with that."

Like you said, you are probably better off in so many ways then compared to 50%+ of the world's population.   Not saying that you should be gratifying every single moment of your life (although that would be nice for all of us...), but you need start appreciating the little things.   If you wake up in the morning without serious bodily pain, the statistics are that, you are already in the top 35% in the world's population in terms of happiness. (Cannot recall exact source).   Admitting is the first step. If you think you are weak, if you think your are a ""pussy"" and that you feel inferior to others. Do something about it. Start with the little decisions and actions to slowly bear yourself towards greatness.   Remember, you don't have to always compare your life to others to evaluate your success, worth and happiness.

For me, when things fall from the plan or don't go my way I tend to see it as a speed bump. For example I'm a freshman at a private university and I didn't apply for FAFSA benefits because my parents haven't filed their taxes in 3 years so that was a huge setback. Neither did my parents have money saved up to help pay since we live paycheck to paycheck. Ended up using my father's unused military benefits and got the first semester paid. However, my second semester tuition bill is $7,000 and that's quite a large sum for my family. I considered taking out student loans but that means that when I graduate I'd have over $60,000 in debt when I graduate. Decided to join the military and have the government footing the bill for me. I have to take a break from the student role and serve out my contract but I'm looking at the bright side. Which is what I guess I'm trying to say.   Just look at the bright side. Be optimistic and see every setback as a new opportunity. That's what I've been doing and my life seems to be going well. My friends admire my ability to optimistic and comment that that my life must be free of problems. Which is far from the truth but when you're constantly finding the positiveness of a situation and not letting the negatives break you down, life seems to be great. I guess I'm just saying don't let the speed bumps bring you to a stop. There's always going to be speed bumps but that's all they are, speed bumps.  TLDR: When life slams a door on your face, a window opens up."

Take a deep breath and accept those feelings.  Then see what you can learn from the failure - as long as you learn something from the experience it isn't a failure! I try to look at everything as an opportunity to learn and not make the same mistake last time.  I'm dealing with this right now - we were going on a trip of a lifetime to Peru, supposed to leave in 2 weeks...and partner got a kidney stone. We could have still made it, but partner waited a fucking week just to get a CT scan. So now we're paying the fees to delay the trip and dealing with trip insurance. I keep pointing out that this is a learning experience - don't freakin' wait for diagnostic testing, the squeeky wheel gets the grease, ESPECIALLY when dealing with doctors offices who never return phone calls in the rat-maze that is the american health care system.

DecidingToBeBetter,2z5gcd,IHeartFraccing,2,Sun Mar 15 19:23:32 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to take some stuff you wrote into consideration for this answer, but really it fits for most people with problems of that kind - since i think you are far from being the only person in that situation. I hope it still helps.  From my perspective, there are two sides to this: Your everyday life and your generel life plan. For activities and motivation throughout the day, I highly recommend the website www.habitrpg.com. I've been using it since the beginning of 2015 and even though there are ups and downs it still helps me to get stuff done. If you take that into consideration, remember that the first days/weeks will be the easiest with a high motivation coming from yourself, but you will have to proof yourself in the long run. You can't rely on any form of external influence to keep you diligent throughout the day. What it comes for myself is having an ordinary structure for the day. Speaking of which, do you cook regularly? That would help improve several problems at a time, e. g. your workout plans.  So there is this. For other ""daily"" issues i would also suggest:  - Get a partner (in case you don't have one).  -  Talk to a consultant of your bank about how to manage your money.  -  Pick up one hobby and keep doing it until it becomes self-rewarding. Ultimately, try to make future plans. Doesn't need to be ""marry / get kids"". Just put some money aside and travel to a country of your choice. I would recommend either New Zealand or a South America Tour. Maybe don't just have vacation there, but participate in a volunteering program or travel with a group of people you don't know in advance (try lonelyplanet or other websites similar). So after all, do anything. You came to this subreddit seeking for help, but it's you who has to do it. That's all it is. Good luck."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z5gcd,mudsauce,2,Sun Mar 15 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"There's a few things you can do, some are hard, some aren't.  First, focus on your health. If you have a healthy body you're more likely to be in a better state of mind, and health is really important anyway. You should take a day and cook up a ton of meals. If you want something cheap, just cook up a ton of potatoes with onions and bok choy. Then make a bunch of turkey patties and wrap them in kale. Figure out how many calories you need each day. Aim for about 100 grams of protein (that's a total ballpark number, depends on your size and how much exercise you do but if you don't do much 100 grams should be chillin) and get about 50 grams of fat, mostly unsaturated fat (again, ball park number). Fill the rest of your calories with the potatoes/onions/bok choy. It tastes good and has a ton of nutrients, plus when potatoes are cooked than made cold again their starch becomes resistant which acts more like fiber. It's also super filling. All these ingredients are really cheap. FYI, a pound of turkey is about 100 grams of protein, give or take depending on if you get ground or breast.   Second, get real honest with yourself. Ask yourself if you really enjoy what you do. Don't make yourself like your job, and in fact, look for other jobs anyway. You might stumble across something you like more.   Don't forget, advice on reddit can't really compare to actually talking to someone. Go see a professional, they can help you sort things out.  Finally, and most importantly, if you want to be happy I recommend picking up a bible. Read one of the gospels (Mark, Matthew, Luke, or John.) I don't know if you're religious already or not, but if you're living life for Jesus then life itself becomes different. It becomes less, and at the same time it becomes so much more. Things that might seem lame become exciting, because you never know who you're going to meet and experience. Your job becomes a place to find others to love, and your work itself becomes much less of a focus.  If you think the concept of God is silly, I can go ahead and tell you what I have found. I'm a physics major at a california state school (in the U.S.), so I hope that can help show that blindly accepting things is not in my nature. I can tell you arguments and counter arguments for a lot of things, and I'll be honest with you when I don't know the answer to a question. In the end though, those sorts of discussions rarely lead to anything, so I can also tell you my story if you're interested.  Lemme know if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer. Good luck man."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z5gcd,little_seed,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:47:26 2015 UTC,"I would recommend reading books. You know that quote about how a person who doesnt read lives one life, while a reader lives a life for every book they read? Try that. Kindle App is free, and there are lots of great reads out there. To get into better shape, there are workouts you can do in small confined areas that dont require equipment (pushups, situps, butt-clenches) and you can make a game of it. Read a chapter of a book, do 10 pushups. Also, for financial issues, you can get books that will help you with that also, or you can subscribe to /r/personalfinance and see if that provides you the advice you are looking for!"

DecidingToBeBetter,2z59ly,greenchocobo,3,Sun Mar 15 18:29:45 2015 UTC,"It might help if you do a bit of soul searching - what is it that you do like to do NOW? What have your teachers and mentors and peers told you you were good at? What do you think you're good at?  Keep in mind - a lot of the whole ""follow your passion"" stuff is a little misleading when it comes to job searching and picking a career.   Mike Rowe said it best - you can dream of becoming a lot of things, but in the end you have to be practical about what you can do and what you're good at. Yes, you need to enjoy your life and your career, but (for example) loving video games is not the same thing as making them, or loving movies is not the same as being an actor. You can love something as much as you want and it still might not be a viable work-field for you. But, of course, you need to enjoy it and being good at what you do is a big part of that.  What about what you are studying do you enjoy now? What is it that drew you to these subjects in the first place? Between law, finance, and computer science there isn't a lot in common (as far as I know) except that they all involve a lot of analysis and (to some degree) problem solving - making connections about patterns to understand a certain legal/financial/computer situation. This is a skill that can be made use of in a huge wide-range of things.  This might be a good time to talk to some of your teachers, maybe - tell them you're not sure what you're going into and see if they have any suggestions to you based on the strengths you have. They've seen your work, they might have a sense of what you are good at and be able to make recommendations. (Also, bonus brownie points in getting them to think about and recognize you if ever you need them to give you reference for job searching of further study.) If they've worked in their particular fields at all, they might also be able to give you an idea of what the work is actually like.  Remember that a university subject doesn't necessarily translate into a specific work-field, at least not necessarily the most obvious one. Someone trained in ""Library/Information Sciences"" might not work in a library - his/her skills are in how to share information, resources and data, and so could be working for major corporations or banks to do that. Take a closer look at the skills that you are developing in the programs you are taking. Do they match the skills that you and your teachers believe you are good at?  Perhaps another possible way of dealing with this is looking at the future you want outside of a career. You've probably had plenty of subconscious thoughts about what you want, things that you want or assume about your future that you haven't really questioned. Do you want to have a stable, 9-5, something routine that will allow you to stay within a community that you like? Do you want to travel a lot? Are you okay in the kind of job that requires long hours, something you can really focus your life on, or do you want time for hobbies and other things? Do you expect to live in a city or a town? Do you want to work in a big company or start one for yourself? Look further into the kinds of jobs you can get in the studies your interested in - go for the ones that look like they'll help you build the life you want."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z59ly,veraciousful,2,Sun Mar 15 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"Haha, it's strange how similar you are to me: I'm turning 20 in April.  Right after school I got an entry-level job at a two-man software company as a juniour programmer and I studied project management at the same time. After I held that job for a year (and got certification for project management, it's only a one year course) I decided to leave both and study what I always wanted to: mechanical engineering.  I was at the university for three weeks and only officially registered as a student for four days before I decided to nope my way out of there.  What am I doing now? Setting up as many job shadow/work experiences as I can. So far I have looked into finance, cooking, IT and graphical design. I still have appointments to watch a journalist, editor, writer and novelist work. I'm hoping one of those will give me a nudge to enroll in a new course of study or get into another entry-level job.  What should you do? Your school should have career councilors and/or qualified psychologists. Go speak to them, voice your concerns and seek their advice. Additional, get a professional career assessment done. This is basically a ~4 hour interview and ""test"" which is then compiled with suggestions as to what careers might suit you.      I mean how do you study for something you lack a passion for?   You don't. I was the highest academic achiever in high school. I was head boy (don't know if your country does that, here's an explanation, it's basically just a huge honour and lots of work). I was dux scholae and everyone expected me to work harder than everyone else. But I hated every second of it, high school was hell for me. At the end of high school I was hospitalized because I had a simple flu bug which caused heart failure and swelling of the brain because I was under so much stress and never got any help for it. Don't do that, don't almost die like I did."
DecidingToBeBetter,2z59ly,DIA13OLICAL,2,Sun Mar 15 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"first of all, this sounds completely normal. When I think about it, it's pretty crazy that people expect college students to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their life and then study accordingly.  Realistically, most people learn what they need for their job while they do their job. College should be there to give you a foundation, and also to broaden your horizons and take courses you will probably never again take in your career.   I was one of those kids who picked a major because I thought it would be beneficial to my future career. What I realize now is I should have just picked a major I liked because my future career/endeavors were already going to teach me anything my major could have taught me.  As for how do you study for something you lack a passion for? You're absolutely right, it's very difficult. If I could offer one piece of advice, it is to keep searching for ways that make the topic relevant to you. Google things, watch youtube videos about it, talk to your friends about it, and eventually some aspect of anything you study might be somewhat relevant to you.  If you do happen to find something you're even remotely interested in, chase it down and give it a chance. Now is the time to do so."

DecidingToBeBetter,2z5ktl,bookwench,1 point,Sun Mar 15 23:20:27 2015 UTC,"It's all contextual, which is why there's no one formula. Which is why it's so confusing. Which is why some folks make big bucks off telling you the Secrets that will Definitely Work.   So if your only goal is to get laid, you can do that pretty easy: dress decent, be clean, smile, and say ""hey! You're gorgeous"" to start enough conversations in enough bars and a significant percentage of women will say yes half an hour later. Or use Tinder or whatever so you all know you're just in it for the hookup.   Relationships are different from hookups. Relationships are where you actually care who the other person is as a person, where you want to spend time getting to know them. Relationships are where timing matters- where you have to pay attention to body language, pay attention to the person as a whole, push enough but not too much. Learning how to be in a relationship is a whole other level. And you are totally going to fuck it up at least once, or a dozen times. Or they are. Getting two people to do something as complicated as a relationship well at the same time is the most difficult team sport there is.   The key to a relationship is to find someone you want who also wants you, be honest about what you want out of the relationship from the start and don't be the person who gets pushy, mean, or bitchy if they a) don't want the same things or b) change their mind. You want the freedom to walk away if she turns out to be crazy? Make sure you give her the same respect.   Respect is a big deal in relationships. Ones without respect on both sides never work. I'm watching a relationship blow up spectacularly because the dude didn't see anything to respect in the woman and made that evident to everyone including her. If you can't find anything to admire about a girl besides her looks, do not bother. Just don't. If she can't find anything in you that she respects, walk away from that shit too.   This is some stuff a lot of guys forget: if you're dating her for her D- cup breasts, don't expect her to have a sparking personality and integrity. If you look for sparkling personality and integrity first, you're more likely to find some physical attributes to enjoy down the road a ways.   In case you think this is a one- gender issue, it's not. Women are also idiots about this. Honey, if he's hot and drives a motor cycle and those are the only reasons you're with him- are you really gonna be surprised when the seat smells like someone else's cootch? Those are the guys you shag and ditch. They're not the guys you actually keep and expect to hold your hair when you get food poisoning, or come over and enjoy a nice home cooked meal and help you replace the squealing faucet.   Relationships are something everyone ends up figuring out for themselves, and then once they have the experiences, they have a common language with other people who have been in relationships to discuss what went wrong and what went right. But until you have the experience it's like trying to describe how to cook roast beef to someone who's only ever eaten sandwiches.   Books help. The better written the book, the more it'll help- and I don't mean self-help books, I mean books in which people are actually in relationships with other people. Chick books are full of this stuff, guy books are not. Which is one reason women are sometimes better equipped to deal with this stuff: we have examples, both good and bad, to draw from. Fictional, but based on real life. We also discuss relationships among ourselves - after all, people and why they do the things they do are some of the most interesting things on the planet. It's too bad this gets labeled gossip and looked down on for guys; makes it hard on guys when they have to ask stuff on the Internet from strangers, and they don't have any sort of background in discussing emotional connections and stuff."

Your sister has become a belligerent, aggravating, complaining nightmare as your mother naturally wants to do the best for her grandchildren. Your mother's in a tough spot and she's trying her best to not rock the boat.   As your sister realizes that she can get away with her shocking behaviour, there is no reasoning with her or pointing out that she's being horrendous - there is no reason for her to change her behaviour. Unless Mom suddenly realizes that she has a daughter that's leeching every single bit of left over energy and or money out of her and stands up to her. But then sis can play the ""I was bullied"" card.   So there it is in a nut shell. You have a choice here, if you think you can continue to stay and life in a peaceable state at home - this is not going to work.   Your sister has deemed you as a non essential element in her life and will never change her behaviour. As a mother she will be demanding this that and the other for the foreseeable future and not have any guilt about making you pay for it. Once entrenched in her attitude, people like that- they very seldom change.   If your stressed then no doubt your mother is too. But to be honest you have to take a long look at your options. Your best bet is financial stability and moving out. That environment is toxic and will make your depression worse. She should not be ""forgiven"" she's not seen anything wrong with her shit behaviour. Plus she's going to go back to making your life a living hell.   The healthy thing and the thing that will make you feel better is, that you can see this now. The only thing that will make this situation better is distance - and seeing things from afar. See if you can stay with some other family members or friends. Start to talk to agencies and look for work. If you have to stay at home, start leaving early in the morning and come back as late as you can. You don't have to engage with this behaviour as it can't be stopped.

While it is somewhat easier to get fixated on something like being on reddit, it makes it very hard to sit and do nothing. My mind fixates on a topic and I attack that topic. If I am sitting on reddit and the topic of male to female sex changes comes up, I can go into a deep hole of research that I don't even really want to do, just because of my level of concentration on a subject. But only if nothing else is on my mind. On adderall I compartmentalize my day a lot more, prioritizing things I need to get done vs things I want to get done.

Putting those together I realized my true calling was to be a motivational speaker. I joined Toastmasters International and began to seek out mentors who would help me get to where I wanted to go. Once I found one I connected with, our discussions turned to a stepping stone to get into the industry, in this case, a coaching background.

Granted, I don't know your whole life situation.   1) consider asking why you missed out on points on certain assignments. It's okay to see the teacher after class/school. A good 15 minutes won't kill you.   2) be mindful of of your friends. Your in a period of time where friendships and appearance have a significant psychological weight. Friends whom don't want you to succeed or help aren't your friends.   3) consider the time spent and your fine management. Properly allocating time can really help you get a perspective on the amount of time you need.   4) you're not perfect. Not having a 5.0 gpa means you're a failure. Nobody is the best at everything. Don't sweat the small stuff, a small dip in gpa could very well be a couple points throughout the year and you just fall one point short of a b+ and a b  5) you'll be okay.

You can use all of these depending on how hard you actually want to sleep :D Scanning barcode is actually great, e.g. make the barcode from something in the bathroom, so to turn off the alarm, you gotta go to the bathroom to scan the barcode, and you're already awaken, I don't think you'd go back to bed from this point considering that you had to wake up to do something.

If you really think you are right and your partner is wrong, try to help him see it (""But if timetravel will be possible, why hasnt anyone visited us from the future?"").

One thing that helps is to first figure out WHY you're doing it even when you wish you would stop. What is it you're trying to get out of it? Do you need to be right? To win the debate? Do you want that person to think you are smart? Maybe find the reason behind what you're doing and try to change that, rather than just trying to change the habit directly. Just one approach."

I've been in therapy that got to that and I'm on track to helping myself open up more. I still fear rejection, especially romantic rejection.   I've lost to my low self-esteem in this area of my life. I'm slowly improving it, but it's a long process to unravel years of self-negativity."

DecidingToBeBetter,2yuq6v,Sensual_Sandwich,1 point,Sun Mar 15 10:00:09 2015 UTC,"Trying to be more comfortable with who I am has helped me a great deal. Most of that vulnerability comes from a negative self image and it's associated effects on my self esteem. Trying to become fitter, more organized, anything that I think will improve myself or my environment has helped me here. I'm still early in this journey, but having that initial hope and belief in your own ability to make yourself better and not to wax depressive about how much is going wrong in your life is the most important thing. Basically trying to create good rather than lamenting the bad.  That along with some good friends to provide me with a sense of social support have helped me a lot.   My big goal is to become far more social, because I love people, I really do. I think people are interesting, beautiful creatures that I want to become closer to. It's just that doing so scares me, as of now. So that fear is what I'm shooting to conquer, that and my fear of not being able to change. No matter what happens, there's going to be something in your power to change, either in social situations or with your self. Taking advantage of that instead of lamenting what you can't control is a big thing too.  And thanks for the good wishes, I wish you the best too!"

However, I don't want my daughter to be afraid of water. I want her to respect the dangers but not be afraid. So much of the summer you can find yours truly in THE BLUE PART OF THE MAP!!

Maturity also encompasses being aware of the correct time and place to behave and knowing when to act, according to the circumstances and the culture of the society one lives in.  Adult development and maturity theories include the purpose in life concept, in which maturity emphasizes a clear comprehension of life's purpose, directedness, and intentionality, which contributes to the feeling that life is meaningful.

DecidingToBeBetter,2ys7he,kindnessprevails,3,Thu Mar 12 13:07:24 2015 UTC,"The way to break the mold is to change your desires or change the resources you have to meet those desires.  A lot of people are changing the way they live by simplifying their needs /r/financialindependence and /r/homesteading.  There are people out there living happy and fulfilling lives on less than $10,000/year and have no desire to make any more money than that and do not require or ask for government assistance.  The other option to breaking the mold is to do something special and make enough money to retire early.  I have opted for this route and have gone from the typical engineering salary of about $100k to around $250k by focusing on my career and making a lot of moves (changed jobs 4 times in the last 5 years).

I have always known that making enough money is nothing more than a mindset and figuring out what makes me personally happy.  Now that I'm actually starting to look at my happiness, the next part is the money.  There are thousands and thousands of ways to legally and ethically make money.  Having a job and working for 40 years is only one of them.  You can build wealth and have more money than you know what to do with if you want or figure out how to make just enough to get by and live simply if that is more your style, like MFTRW said.  Money is really just another mental barrier when it comes down to it as a lot of people have been conditioned to feel guilty about having it when, if you have legitimately earned your money, there is nothing wrong with it, even if it's billions of dollars."

Volunteer to help a person who works at the local coffee shop: instant positive vibes when you come in next time. Volunteer to help a stranger: you're one of the people who makes the world suck less.   Make it your mission to make a contribution wherever you go and with whatever you do. Do this even when no one is looking.   The whole universe will be your community. Plenty of friends are waiting to be made.

DecidingToBeBetter,2yrvcr,thombudsman,4,Sat Mar 14 02:38:46 2015 UTC,"There are so many university students and young adults who experience these things. You grow up and lose connection with your old friends, family is no longer enough to fill your social needs. Some fall in love and move in with a SO, basically starting a new family right away, others travel and spend most of their socializing with new friends, others live on a university campus and make friends they then spend lots of time with. And some haven't solved that problem yet, thus feeling dissatisfied or confused with the whole situation much like it seems you do.  I think what is important to realize is that 1) to be satisfied you need to be active in seeking out nice social relations, and 2) it's probably easier than it seems.   People who lean to the left are hardly scarce. Maybe you have other interests as well? Try to connect those dots with the additional social dot, and give those communities a chance. For example I really like being outdoors and apparently there are multiple groups doing just that quite close to where I live. So my mindset will be that unless I try that option, thus being active in fulfilling my desires, I don't have an excuse whenever I'm feeling lonely or bored. To demonstrate the mindset I'd even go as far as saying ""well I like this particular boardgame/book/movie/video game/etc, so I'll print some notices outlining that I'd like to play this game and even make some new friends, put an email address and hang them around town"".   I think for many people there are some psychological boundaries which make it difficult or exhausting to approach new social situations or new people, and you have to manage those, even break them down. You can only make friends if you try to."

But the great part is once you make a mistake, it's in the past and I bet you won't make that mistake too many more times. But, if you never even try you won't go anywhere.   I want to sort of disagree with what some people have been saying ""don't worry, it'll be easy"" for me it wasn't and still isn't. I get super nervous trying to be social with  new people, it's always harder than I think it will be BUT it is worth it, and if I stay in the mindset that it will always be hard then I know I'm doing the best I can, and that's all anyone can ask for."

If you're like me, you're going to try to find the perfect volunteer activity, or try to make a huge impact. This is just your brain's way of keeping you where you are. It thinks it's doing a good job. Thank it, and set it aside. Then go out and do your small deed.  Remember, go small. Build from there. And in between, be sure to keep your own list of goals updated.

I totally hear what you're saying. After you get married and have kids you just can't do spontaneous shit that often anymore. I was the same way. I went into the office and was pretty transparent to everyone. It seemed like everyone being promoted had some sort of connection and rose. I make a decent wage. I can't quit because my kids are getting ready to start college and the risk in this economy is too high. Rather than make some huge jump into something right now because it sounds like you're still figuring shit out do something new. Join a book club, a running club or find something you wouldn't normally do to see if you like it. I trained and did a marathon. After it was all said and done I did 9 marathons and a couple century rides. Now when those smug fuckers look at me when I wear my marathon shirt I know they aren't shit and I've learned to so something I really like. Figure out what works for you. But you have to try something. I've always loved reading. Literature, philosophy and history. My company has tuition reimbursement so even though I have an undergrad in economics I looked at what degrees my local universities had for evening programs. It fit within the company degrees so I went for it. I'm half way through getting my masters in philosophy. I've taken my wife and kids on this little journey too. My wife an accountant has joined a book club and she goes out for drinks with us after class. Most of these kids are half my age. We have fun. My friend take a step or leap and go out and have fun. You can still provide for your wife and kids. As for your relatives maybe you can initiate like a camping trip or something less expensive. I think its pretty inconsiderate they don't recognize you have kids to educate and can't make adjustments on trips. We have family trips where we meet somewhere on the Blue Ridge Parkway and you can either camp or stay in a hotel. We can hike, bike and just hang out. Some stay in hotels and some in tents. We don't judge. Maybe everyone can chip in for a cabin. Try it sometime. Well I'm not one for giving advice but this is what worked for me. I hope everything works out for you. Good luck."

DecidingToBeBetter,2yt02j,GreenMan48,2,Fri Mar 13 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"I did marine corp in 2013 too. Wasn't that when the hurricane was rolling in. It dropped like 20 degrees. I blew out my hamstring and made it to the bridge. I ended up having to walk most of the way after that. It was insane. My first marathon was a new years resolution type of thing. I wanted to get my shit together. If you are in decent shape, not too big and don't smoke it takes about 5 months to train. That's what I went by at least. I went on a marathon listing site and looked at marathons 5 months out. I ended up doing the Cincinnati Flying Pig marathon. We have relatives in the area so I was able to crash at their place. I'm not going to lie. It was hard and painful as fuck. It took me 5 hours and those god damn Kentucky foot hills were brutal. I got way out of my comfort zone and did something I would never thought of doing. I joined our local running club and met the craziest group of people.

Napoleon Hill talks specifically about starting each day by THANKING yourself for having experienced failures, adversities and defeats in the past. You express gratitude because for each of these events, a seed has been planted of equal magnitude to be harvested in the present moment.  Romantic failure? How did it fail? What went wrong? How did you react then? What can you say you've learned? The learned part is important -- until you internalize what you've been through and synthesize something you can say that you ""learned,"" you'll be swimming in a quagmire of defeatism.  Next time one of these thoughts comes up, sit down with a pen and piece of paper, shut off your phone, and allow yourself the time to write yourself a note about it. Explain what the situation was like. Explain how you felt then. Then, write what you've learned about it.  If you've got the time and inclination, take a 10-day silent course in Vipassana meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka. I see you've been through therapy. Taking a course after therapy helps to wash away the sediment that's been kicked to the surface during therapy. Taking a course also teaches one to deal with thoughts of the past, like what you would say in that situation you had with that person in the past, along with thoughts of the future. The end result is an ability to stop reacting to these thoughts, and to simply let them be and fade away.  dhamma.org"

As far as I know, there are three ways to do this:   Sit on a park bench and do nothing. Get up when you're done. Talk with a clinical psychologist trained in cognitive behavioral therapy for a few months. Pick up mindfulness meditation and/or yin yoga.   Each has its pros and cons. A combination of the three may be best.   As you spend philosophizing and believing that so long as you can think it out, a solution exists, the stronger the pattern of philosophizing becomes and the deeper down the rabbit hole you go. As far as I know, there is no bottom.  There is, however, a shortcut. Shut off your mind. Get used to having it off. Stop reacting to the ever-growing pile of logic you're developing around your ego-awareness. Introduce a pattern to calm the mind down.  Sit, breathe, rinse, repeat."

Now that you've mentioned it in this context, it makes sense: I can imagine those old wise guys who smile instead of saying low-weight words not thinking, but having their thought processes empty, giving it all away to the unconscious.

They should be greeted the same way you greet a passing breeze. Listen to the trees blow, but do not engage them.  A meditation practice that may give you a taste of this is to get comfortable, slow your breathing down, breathe simply for a few moments and ask yourself: much like a cat watching a mouse hole, ""what will my next thought be?"" You may experience a brief period of no-mind in the interim. Or, the thought could come up instantaneously without pause. Do this a few times and you may have some success.

When I was 17 I went abroad with a student group and I found that being alone let's you be more in tune with the environment you're in, the people you surround yourself with (family, lovers etc.) while travelling are pieces of your home, it's like you're bring a bit of the UK with you to get in the way of new experiences , without them it's just you and this new fascinating place.

I did it on my own, didn't know anything about backpacking, it was a great experience and it teaches you a lot about yourself and how to deal with problems, you can't expect anything to happen without your move... cause you are on your own.  I got hit by culture shock and anxiety on my second day in Indonesia feeling very far away from everything I knew, but when you really want something the world conspires for you to get it. My biggest tip is to do it because you want to and want complete independence.   Here's me at Rinjani Trek Looking at the volcano inside the crater. It was awesome.  Edit : I understand what you mean by not being able to share the experience. If you stay at hostels you will meet other intrepid travelers and you before you know it you will be doing activities together and sharing it with those people. There are cases where you will be alone. For example at the airport, in transits and sometimes in crappy hostels where everyone is hostile and unfriendly. You just have to go with it.

I did an internship for a big company for a few months and saved money by cutting on nights out and avoiding restaurants. In the end, some sacrifices have to be made. Pricing varies a lot depending on which part of the world you are travelling in and if you don't have a fixed schedule you can buy flights on the go for cheap and move on to the next destination...  If you don't have a lot of money I recommend South-east Asia. Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos are very cheap. I was spending 5-10$ in hostels for a night and another 5-10$ for food(daily). Transportation is dirt cheap. I once negotiated a taxi cab across a whole island for 10$.  Doing the american west coast was obviously more expensive. Most hostels were 8-20$ and you know the price of food... Transportation was also a big deal, buses were reasonably priced. I ended up renting a car with two backpackers to visit national parks. I believe we spent 80$ each for a few days including food. Although we slept in the car and I ate a can of sardines for supper. It sounds crazy, but again, it's the experience.  If you want exact numbers I took many, many flights with layovers. I flew 9 times in two months. I also flew with Asia Airlines and Malaysia Airlines which have a bad rep so their cheaper. I also had 3-4 sleepless nights   every month. A guy I met was sleeping at a place with 24 bunk beds in a single long hall. There's also Malaria and other mosquito infections you need to lookout for. I got used to that lifestyle after 3 weeks coming from a very clean and quiet environment. If you ever do decide to do backpacking with me up with a PM I can list you things to consider that are very important."

No, there won't be anyone in your life (family, friends) who you will share the experience with, but you will share it with them when you return. You'll always have that experience for yourself and people will always take an interest in you for having had it.   When you are alone and traveling, things will go a bit wrong, just by the natural order of the universe (Murphy's Law?). This is the best part. You are forced to work them out. There's no ""I quit, I want to go home, this isn't working"" YOU have to figure it out. It's an awesome feeling and amazing for personal growth.

It fucking changed my life.   ...  Honestly, to some degree I still view consumeristic travel as kind of stupid but I was not acknowledging a wholly different type of travel.  Solo travel allows you to gather your thoughts, engage your mind and exercise your creative investigative skills to explore your environment and ultimately to not only survive but to prosper and make connections with people around you.  It was while travelling alone that I decided to quit my job. It was while travelling alone that I had the most amazing ideas for my work. It was while travelling alone that I met some of the most amazing people who would end up changing the way I think. It was while travelling alone that I was able to write more than I had ever written before and start new habits that would eventually change the person I was to become the person I am today.  Yes.  It's Scary.  But that's the point. That is exactly why it's so worth it, because you'll have a tool within yourself that so many other people don't have. Do it, you won't regret it.  Also, you find yourself doing more daring things just because nobody knows you there. I was able to justify approaching girls randomly on the streets a lot more because I billed myself as a tourist.

Don't be afraid to engage total strangers in commentary about what you are experiencing/seeing.

You're in a really great position; you're male, over drinking age everywhere, presumably able and from the UK which  generally has the cheapest airline tickets I've seen around.  If you hostel you will meet other travellers, and you might travel with them for a bit. I socialize much more when I travel then I do at home  because everyone wants to talk in common rooms.  Also sometimes group travel makes a lot more sense. I did a large part of SA this way when it was unsafe for a woman alone or the sites I wanted to see were too awkward to get to with a group. There's still opportunities to go off alone during group travel, you just have to make it back. You make lots of friends, I still talk to most of them, two of them even got married last year!

I used to have social anxiety to the point where even getting on the subway could reduce me to tears. When I'm in a foreign country where I don't speak the language and don't know anybody, that pushes me WAY outside my comfort zone and helps me realize that things I thought were a big deal really aren't.  I've traveled domestically and abroad solo, and although sometimes I just want to go somewhere and be quiet, I've met some awesome people on my adventures as well - some people I may never see again and others I've become good friends with. My first solo trip, I did meet up with friends once I got into the country, but spent a lot of time on my own too. It helped flying somewhere I knew I could see one familiar face, but not needing to rely on them the entire time.  If I waited on others to come with me, I'd never get anywhere. And that's how I've done 6 - 7 next week - countries/3 new continents in 2.5yrs while working full-time. I squeeze travel in on my own schedule whenever possible. Go places that have always intrigued you - then, regardless of whom you meet, you'll come home with a host of stories and memories that will stay with you forever - and that will matter to you as you continue to grow and explore.

DecidingToBeBetter,2yp0ss,kkristynn,15,Wed Mar 11 16:57:19 2015 UTC,"This might sound a little bit cliche, and not the specific answer you are looking for but my answer is everything. We have all heard that you don't attempt something you fail by default, so why would you not just do it?  Any life worth living is made up of continuous effort. That doesn't mean that you have to constantly be putting forth max effort with everything you do all day long, but you should always to leaving your comfort zone to a degree and working towards something. All successful people have lives that are FULL of failure, it's just that people rarely notice the failures because the successes stand out better.  I think that the key is just changing your view on what constitutes a failure. This subreddit is about deciding to be better people, and growing and improving. In pretty much everything that you make a honest effort in, whether you succeed or fail at achieving your ultimate goal, you will improve as a person. Success means you are better than you were before you made the effort, which is almost always the case."
DecidingToBeBetter,2yp0ss,mkhnghn,3,Wed Mar 11 19:40:54 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly. As a kid, and while I was growing up, I excelled at a lot of stuff that I tried the first time.  I built myself up so high on the stuff I was damn good at that I only kept doing what I knew I would succeed at.    And that is a soul-crushing, hopelessly dull way to live life (so I found).  I would rather stare at an overgrown garden that I swore I wouldn't let overgrow, than never to have planted it. I would rather stare at tumbleweeds of dog hair that overrun the house, than to have never gotten a dog.  I would rather live alone, heartbroken and sad, than to have never taken a chance and moved across a state to live with my now ex-boyfriend.   Fail, fail again. It makes you stronger."
DecidingToBeBetter,2yp0ss,alliezoomzoom,2,Thu Mar 12 01:40:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I was in the same position as a kid, where I excelled at a lot of things right away, and always had people telling me I was really good at things as a kid so I always thought people were either inherently good or bad at something (rather than it being a product of effort) and I avoided the things that I thought I wasn't naturally good at. It is a dangerous way to think because eventually you get to a point or a level where nothing comes easy and the only people who succeed are the people willing to work hard and take risks.  Josh Waitzkin has an awesome segment of his book The Art of Learning (which I HIGHLY recommend for anyone who hasn't read it) where he talks about the value of failure as a kid, and how growing up NOT being great at things (when you know that your successes are due to intense effort rather than natural ability) often results in more productive, more successful adults."

I definitely fell into the former category--teachers, friends, my parents...all told me how smart I was.  And I really learned to fear failure because then I would lose that status.  Effort is something everyone can make, regardless of intelligence. In a way, the people I envy and admire as an adult fall into the ""effort"" category far more than the ""I made straight A's in school"" category.

I've started these 30 Days Fitness Challenges three days ago (today's the third day, haven't started yet, resting from a long walk). Five challenges, all with a single own exercise to challenge myself with. One exercise is squats, something I dreaded immensely before starting.  Now, I've been sitting before the computer screen... basically, my whole life after my back healed (so, it's been 13 years now). I guess you can tell I don't have strong legs because of that, so using them for a challenge - fifty fucking times in the first day - sounded so horrifiying, especially in contrast to 15 push-ups for a start (something I've already been doing for a while, so it's easy).  Guess just how much proud I was of myself when I finished those 50 squats! I lied there, on my bed, smiling like crazy for few minutes straight, just thinking of how I fucking came over this seemed-impossible obstacle. Impossible? Bah! Tough to do, no doubt, and legs hurt the next morning, but hey, it's a challenge for a reason, right?  The reason I felt so proud was in that I always wanted to be strong, mentally and physically, but until some time ago I was only dreaming of it, not daring to do stuff for it because I was afraid to fail. You know what? Over time, I got tired of being afraid because it pushed so many great things I can achieve away.  When trying new stuff, I guarantee you, you will be anxious for the first time, but that's no reason to not try. We all are, even the greatest and the most successful. Yet, what motivates is this: if they were afraid but went forward, how am I any worse than them to not try it out?  There's a great quote by Marianne Williamson that brightens my day every time I remember it. You can print it out and put it on your bed to read it the first thing in the morning, so good it is. Here goes:   Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.   So maybe you don't want to be physically strong like I do. That's fine. Choose your own path, look for what you're attracted to in life. Do you like music? Make some of your own, turn your audio recorder on and bang some rhythm on the table. Do you like baseball? Get a bat and a ball and train your hits in the backyard or a park. Do you like just how fascinating it is that some people can translate video frames into an amazing story? Go ahead and make your own movies with a shitty camera, a short script and a single actor - yourself.  Don't trick yourself into thinking that just because you can't make great things right now you can't start training with doing shitty things first. After all, that's how the greatest achieved their immortality - made their stuff crap, found out it's not good enough, figured out what was wrong with it, made another, better crap - up until when their crap is worth millions or serves humanity for ages to come."

DecidingToBeBetter,2yln7m,blahblah98,18,Tue Mar 10 22:49:13 2015 UTC,All this can make me think of is an ivory tower. A college degree does not give you functional knowledge. At best it can give you a foundation to build off of. At worst your professors have taught you poor methodology due to their own inexperience or incompetent teaching methods. The only real way to gain functional knowledge is through work experience.
DecidingToBeBetter,2yln7m,CargoHound,4,Tue Mar 10 23:52:41 2015 UTC,"Some are reading this as self-education vs. expensive university education, but I feel that's ancillary to the point of the author's claim.  Certainly there's no shortage of evidence of individuals becoming experts without attending college or universities, which are simply large-scale standardized and proven learning methodologies.    What the author is missing is that an accomplished self-learner would never claim expertise without validating it in a meaningful and defensible way: peers, real-world applications, testing, etc.  The ability to demonstrate and defend expertise is everything; how the expertise was achieved is nearly irrelevant; whether by reading 10,000 books, one book, or figuring it out on your own.  Without demonstrated validation, to read 10 books and then believe yourself to have achieved an 8 sigma level of expertise is delusion.    There's no shortage of self-proclaimed experts, exaggerators, charlatans and deluded people wreaking havoc in the world.  What we do have a shortage of are sufficiently educated people (self- or otherwise) who can question and challenge authority, dogma and unsubstantiated claims in a reasonable way.  Like this one."

DecidingToBeBetter,2yln7m,cloudsareunderrated,5,Tue Mar 10 23:32:44 2015 UTC,"Formal logic. It should be required learning throughout an elementary education, but of course our politicians and corporate leaders don't actually want a thinking populace that can spot a logical fallacy. Also, beware: if you read 3 books on formal logic, television will become completely unwatchable."
DecidingToBeBetter,2yln7m,magnus_von_black,2,Wed Mar 11 00:37:35 2015 UTC,Can you recall any examples of said topic? I'm genuinely curious.
DecidingToBeBetter,2yln7m,Nanniro,10,Wed Mar 11 01:03:34 2015 UTC,"Formal logic helps you to start seeing the world in terms of truths and untruths. It exercises your faculty for classifying information, drawing mathematically correct conclusions from real world data, and avoiding bad decisions because you can't clearly parse through all the aspects of a tactical life situation.  A good reason to study formal (and informal) logic is to spot logical fallacies that are being used against you. For instance (and this is kind of a stupid example that I'm just making up right now), let's say you support raising taxes to improve library services in your town. No doubt Fox News will run a headline that says something like, ""82% of Americans oppose stealing money from successful people to buy liberal books full of sex and violence.""  There a couple of fallacies at work here. The most obvious fallacy is the Straw Man argument. They are grossly misrepresenting the case for buying library books. Whereas you might want there to be a greater selection so that people can be more informed, and that economically disadvantaged people might have access to information that could improve their lives, Fox News has pointed out that the money will also be used to buy novels, many of which contain sex and violence. They have made you seem like a creep by creating a shitty argument that you never made and putting it into your mouth.  The other fallacy used here is the ""argumentum ad populum"". They are basically saying that because 82% of Americans oppose library taxes, that raising library taxes is objectively the wrong thing to do. But millions of people also buy Justin Bieber music, this doesn't make him an objectively good musician.  But aside from politics and argument, formal logic can help you make better decisions about your life. You begin to think in a more structured, peaceful way, and your ability to process and analyze your emotions improves. You can set a goal, collect data about your feelings, about potential obstacles, about strategies for achieving the goal, and begin to live in a more volitional, organized manner. That has been my experience. I am still a very passionate, artistic person, but I try to be as logical as possible about everything. Logic is the mathematics that underpins the relationships between facts, and understanding how facts relate and extrapolating those relationships into future possibilities is an important key to living a successful life. Well, that's my opinion. Feel free to attack my logic. =)"

You have to associate any tips or examples you might read directly to your own life. If the book recommends smiling think about where you could smile more, how your face looks at this very moment, etc and ideally create a trigger that will reminder you when to smile. Imagine very intensely and repeatedly in which situations you will smile more. Make the mental images concrete - e.g. if you intend to smile every time you see a mirror visualise daily situations where you see a mirror and how you will behave on them (smile) make them concrete - include the color of the work elevator's carpet in which there's a big mirror, the taste if the toothpaste while you brush teeth, play the situation out, etc.  Memories are encoded through brain networks, more specifically, once you experience something the very same network through which you experienced it basically becomes the network which contains the memory.

DecidingToBeBetter,2yky8k,undrstndngthmn,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:31:15 2015 UTC,"Stoicism:       Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that destructive emotions resulted from errors in judgment, and that a sage, or person of ""moral and intellectual perfection"", would not suffer such emotions.   Stoics were concerned with the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, and the belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy as a way of life, and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how that person behaved.   Later Stoics—such as Seneca and Epictetus—emphasized that, because ""virtue is sufficient for happiness,"" a sage was immune to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase ""stoic calm,"" though the phrase does not include the ""radical ethical"" Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.

The phone really is a constant stress inducer in my life. We have never been so connected via Twitter and Facebook, and it makes me feel more disconnected than I ever have in my life.

I've recently deleted my Facebook, which was really the only social media I used, and that was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time.  And I've made sure to do a lot better with my reddit time. I deleted my old account and started a new one with none of the default subs and just filled it will productivity, zen, etc. subs. And so instead of just lurking for hours and doing nothing productive, I'll go and try to join in conversations, share some of my experiences, make some new friends. I actually reaped the fruit of that almost immediately, I posted a picture of one of my art projects on /r/SomethingIMade (one of the OC art subreddits that has a fantastic and supportive community) and got asked to trade some work with a guy across the country. It's a small thing, but it's a connection that I never would have made and an experience I would never have if I hadn't focused on trying to be a little more conscious of my time, rather than wasting hours looking at who-knows-what and not getting anything out of it."

Everyone is dealing with something deep inside just like you. So go back to your positives and focus on it. Third - I got a divorce after 7 years of marriage - it was difficult - I was not used to being alone. But then I realized the opportunity for me to explore so many things. New sport, new friends, maybe learn to play the piano. I took it one day at a time. two years later - i play tennis 2-3x a week (never played tennis before), I am in a relationship with a wonderful man, love reading more than ever and so on... Focus on the possibilities and one foot in front of the other.. Have some goals and do something about it every day. This is not a uni-specific advice but i find that the tips are pretty universal.

The first thing you need to realize is that life is both really short and really long. What I mean by that is you don't need to be in a rush to get where you want to be, take a breath, and make each day a small achievement. This is where you are doing some self reflection, changing things you think are holding you back. Happiness does not just happen. I decided a long time ago to start writing a journal. First thing I do when I wake in the morning is write for :30-1:00 on anything. Usually it's thoughts or goals, but many entries are just mindless scribbling or the same words written over and over. You learn a lot about yourself in this way, and it will aid in the discipline you seek.  Second suggestion would be to make new friends. I'm not saying get rid of your old ones, but rather put yourself out there to experience new ideas and activities. It will allow you to immerse yourself in a new way of thinking, and it will allow you to grow.  3rd I cannot stress this one enough. Get a hobby. Immerse yourself it in. You would be amazed by the confidence you can achieve by building your personal skills. It will help bring some passion to your life. Also chicks dig a man with a hobby.  In my stupor the 3 greatest resources for me were: Napoleon Hill's ""Think and grow rich"" ""The Joy of Happiness"" from the Dalai Lama and The ill methodology(youtube it).  Life is not a race, it's a walk to be enjoyed. Took me a long time to figure that out."
DecidingToBeBetter,2yktju,Petyrgozinya,2,Wed Mar 11 17:29:42 2015 UTC,"I like this, I also 2nd the journal. When you're forced to put your thoughts down in a sequential manner rather than having everything roll around in your head with no real order, you're able to see your own thoughts in a new light.  To add to your 2nd point about making new friends, remember this: You're the sum of the 5 people you hang around most. So, maybe you do need to get rid of old ones if they're holding you back. If you surround yourself with positive/supportive people then you will absorb some of those qualities without knowing it. The people in your life are either a huge obstacle or propellant."

It's literally what you're      made of. Remember that.    To add on that, my life started to get on a more defined and successful track when I started going to the gym 3-4 days a week about 3 years ago. Once I started doing that, its amazing how everything else falls into place when you've got your body in the right gear. If your body is in tune, then your mind will follow suite. That's kind of the correlation I've personally noticed. So maybe take a step back and reevaluate your daily living conditions and if those aren't in check, its more than likely causing your mental issues with laziness and depression, not vice-versa.

Words of wisdom: do something that helps others, now.  Don't wait until you've ""made it."" Don't wait until you've built the next SaaS wonder-app that everyone uses and gets all the flair. Don't wait until you've got money to donate to charity. Don't wait until you ""figure out a value system.""  Do it now.  Our biology is rooted in helping each other. In an academic environment, we're often pitted against each other to get the best grades or to be the ""smartest."" You know what I'm talking about here. The smartest one gets to flaunt their smarts all over the place. This runs straight to the top of the academic platform. Developing a new life-saving algorithm is great and all, but will it publish?! This trickles down, especially in computer science, where you're often asked NOT to work with others on your homework.   Face it, academia can be a rough place to develop a love of helping others. The outside world, however, is a great place. It's full of people who are experiencing real pain, and need real solutions, today.  Find out who you want to help. Who do you know? What groups of people do you like associating with? Who would you like to associate with in the future?   What problems do this specific group of people face in life and in business? Why are these problems significant obstacles to their success? What would it mean to have these obstacles removed? How would that transform them and/or their organizations? What would they be willing to pay for this service?  (That second question ladder is field-tested. Please throw it at someone and watch how excited they get about answering.)  The smart person's adage is to rework the world in their own image. School trains us to build a grand machine and deliver it to the world, expecting payment and tribute for its grand design. As an artist, yeah sure, knock your socks off with that. As someone who wants money in exchange for their time, you need to know something about the person who'll be parting with their money. Focus on giving others relief for the pains they experience. Lessening suffering is divine. Asking for compensation is capitalism.

You want to be a woodworker. Not you want to be a novice woodworker or you want to be a person learning woodworking.  We often grossly underestimate what it takes to be good at something. What's important is that you take it a day at a time. ""Pushing yourself"" is just being consistent.  I decided a couple of years ago that I'd eventually like to write some articles and try to get them published. At first, I would get discouraged because I wasn't really writing magazine grade kinda stuff. When I'd get discouraged, I wouldn't want to write any more.  Then I just decided that I was going to write every day, no matter what. I wasn't going to worry about being good or how long it'd take me to get better, I just wrote. I learned to enjoy it each time I did it instead of worrying about progress.  Two years later, I recently had my second submission accepted for a regional publication. It's still not the big time, but it's a big milestone in that direction. I just did it every day that I could. Eventually, a year or two's worth of practice adds up.  Your life is really more like a garden than a race. If you plant your seeds, nurture them, prune the plants -- you'll get fruit eventually. What's important is that you're always there, putting the work in. It's not so hard to dedicate a small amount of time each day to ""practice"" as long as you understand that it's a small, albeit necessary, step towards mastery."

DecidingToBeBetter,2yj1m0,fuckoffjohnnyutah,4,Tue Mar 10 05:15:36 2015 UTC,"A couple of thoughts on this.     this could be a result of fatigue/exhaustion.  Are you sleeping enough?  are you eating properly, do you exercise regularly, do you have social outlets?  Are you drinking too much, on drugs or medications?  These all are foundational issues that if they are out of whack, everything else will be very difficult to achieve. When you're alone with your thoughts, what do they say?  Do you say flattering things about yourself while realistically acknowledging less than perfect actions?  or do you use phrases like, ""I'm a bad person,"" ""I'm an idiot,"" ""Why do I always do this?""  Self-talk is far more profound than people think it is and instead of being a symptom of your actions, is often a motivator for them.  So if you are condemning yourself as a person, then you are more likely to act in ways that make that true.  But if you say to yourself, ""I guess I'd like to this differently next time.  I want to do it this way and that will make me feel good about the situation."" You are more likely to act in a positive way. Has there been an event that has been hurtful in the period where you noticed a decline in motivation.  A divorce, an accident, a major breakup, a medical situation.  These can all put you in a phase requiring healing that will require time and careful treatment of your self.  Sometimes counseling helps, sometimes free expression like drawing, writing, singing, or even exercise helps.   You are not stuck forever.  Change can happen very rapidly and once you start down that path of real change, things can turn around very quickly."

Im sure there's many redditors here that are more than cappable of giving you tips and pointers how to turn your life back. Afterall you are still young!   First, it's great to hear that your parents are - to some extent - willing to support you and your endevours.   If money is the problem, why not try and get a part time job? Heck, even a full time one that doesn't require a college degree? You are a good looking guy, and reading how you write, you seem intellectual too!   Save some money, exercise in between (you dont need a bike to do cardio exercises) and reshape you and your life. Nobody can really control event. Events such as the family you are born into, your environment and where you live. But you have a choice as to how you respond. Your reaction, attitudes and even small decisions will take your life and turn it all the way around.   What are your goals? Do you want to go to high school just for the sake of experience? You don't necessarily need a degree or a high school certificate to work a 9 to 5 job.

Although you didn't really give enough information about your situation to tell for sure, it sounds as if you struggle with a heathy dose of perfectionism. If you never finish something it continues to live in its ideal form forever in your mind, untouched by the harsh realities of actually existing. Nothing ever lives up to the hype we give it.   The good news is that the solution is simple: Just finish.  When you get a few successes under your belt, you may realize that it doesn't matter anymore. Perhaps you are already successful in your own way. Maybe you are completing things and are not giving yourself credit for those things because, ""It doesn't count because it was too easy.""?  Maybe you are actually afraid of succeeding because you believe that you don't deserve it. Do it anyway. The whole concept of ""deserving"" is toxic. Life is what it is. You get what you get, both good and bad, whether you deserve it or not.  I could go on, but this is enough to get you started. Good luck and have fun."

Since everyone, regardless of being in a relationship or not, likes feeling like they have something to offer, it would probably be best to think about what you would like to offer the world in general.   What kind of person do you want to be?   If you have things you wanted to do or be when you were a kid, think about them now.  If you have ever thought about things you would like to do or be before you get old, think about them now.  Think about people you admire-in your life, history, in fiction, or even a more completely made up character you could admire if you ever encountered them that you made up specifically for this.  Are there any overarching themes or similarities?  If you do see a big dream that you could go for, and it is scary big, think about the absolutely smallest part of that dream you could accomplish regularly and start making it a habit.  As examples- lose weight=stop drinking soda and drink enough water every day, write a novel= write three pages a day, become a world traveler= leave the house every day, and regularly look for airline deals.     If you don't see a big dream or goal as you think about yourself, but some smaller stuff that looks like it might be fun to play around with, do it. Play is vastly underrated in our society. We learn so much by playing for fun. Pick up a hobby if you remember enjoying it, or think it would be a cool thing to do before you die. You might have fun.   And who knows, maybe while you get to know yourself, you become someone with something to offer people in general.   Maybe even someday you will meet someone who likes what you have to offer, and you like what they have to offer.   In the meantime, you are probably having more fun than if you hadn't done anything about how you feel about yourself by finding some new goals/habits/fun."

Sure in great amounts anger, envy, guilt etc. can be bad for you. But they are just as necessary and helpful in the right doses  as the other (good)virtues mentioned.

The original tale (which is a bit weirder) goes:   An Eskimo fisherman came to town every Saturday afternoon. He always brought his two dogs with him. One was white and the other was black. He had taught them to fight on command. Every Saturday afternoon in the town square the people would gather and these two dogs would fight and the fisherman would take bets. On one Saturday the black dog would win; another Saturday, the white dog would win – but the fisherman always won! His friends began to ask him how he did it. He said, “I starve one and feed the other. The one I feed always wins because he is stronger.""  Link to story in The Holy Spirit: Activating God's Power in You   EDIT:  After a little more subsequent reading, some commentary online also attached the story to 1927's  Steppenwolf by Herman Hesse.  So I don't really know where it came from.  :)  As the Zen Pencils guy says right on his site:   Regardless of the origin, it’s a great little proverb and one I wanted to adapt and share with you."

DecidingToBeBetter,2yfcmt,killertofuuuuu,3,Mon Mar 9 09:25:37 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I have the tendency to over analyze my work as well. Here's my belief as to why you do this (and I do as well) -- it's part of your personality. You prefer to keep your options open, seeking out the best possible solution to a problem. You are fearful of mistakes and waste. The unfortunately reality is you see too many options and because you lack enough objective criteria to make an easy decision, you squander precious time and productivity on ""what ifs"". What you need to do is narrow your choices, select the best of that list, and then act. There is no perfect option or you would have found it already, there are only trade-offs between good options, so choose what gives you the most of what you want and get moving. Action trumps perfection.  If you'd like to explore whether my assumption about your personality is true or not, try www.16personalities.com for a free test.   Now, more importantly, here's my suggestion as to how you overcome this indecision (and it will be a constant battle):  1) Decide on your goal/objective and visualize it clearly. Having a crystal clear vision is key to your success. If you don't know enough to form one, you need to ask questions of yourself or others. Why are you pursuing it? What are the key outcomes that must come from this work/decision? What are pitfalls to avoid?  Unless explicitly asked to do so as part of your assignment, do NOT try and devise a system. This is strictly a one-off project that you need to tackle and complete to be able to move to the next item on your to-do list. You need to keep this in mind, otherwise you will try and perfect little details that produce diddly-squat (yes, they need doing, but not this time around).  2) Assess the facts. Stay grounded in the present realities of the situation: what you know to be true or false. You can incorporate past experience and influencing factors, but don't stray from concrete evidence. It will be helpful to quickly make a list.  Now you have a objective and the structure in which you are working. You know your capabilities and time limitations. Devise your action plan and then stick to it. If you can, simply repeat what was successful previously.  3) Break down your long goal into middle and short goals. Write them down and then work through each one in sequence.  Only once you've completed your task in its entirety do you get to go back and analyze your work.  Hope this gives you something to start with and make work for you."

DecidingToBeBetter,2yfcmt,Meetnah,1 point,Tue Mar 10 06:20:46 2015 UTC,"thank you, that's excellent advice - I began making action plans in my life and it helped.  But I am still left with feeling over whelmed in the moment - like I am not good at thinking on my feet and dealing with problems immediately as they come which is a problem.  I wish I could respond to things in the moment and calmly instead of panicking and freezing and then not making a good decision.  I have trouble dealing with reality in the present"
DecidingToBeBetter,2yfcmt,futurefeelings,2,Thu Mar 12 04:46:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, practise makes perfect. Try and put yourself in situations where you have to make snap decisions to get comfortable with it. Start with small things and work up. Computer games are one - I don't have a link, but research suggests people that play first person shooters have better decision making because they are constantly subjected to a barrage of information and must make good choices to progress. Another could be to ask friends to put you on the spot - you have to decide what's for dinner or a movie etc. you can also do this to yourself- any time you have the opportunity to make a decision, you make it, and live with the consequences. Deliberately make some bad decisions and live with the consequences of those. Decide to eat food you don't like, just to remind yourself that not getting what you want ain't really that bad. Spend less than 10 minutes deciding where to to open a new bank account Remember - any plan is better than no plan. If you hesitate, you have no plan. Also, your new mantra is ""if no one died, and no one went to prison, that's a successful decision"". This will help you set the bar lower."

DecidingToBeBetter,2yfcmt,winklebean,3,Sun Mar 15 21:29:20 2015 UTC,"Over thinking is the opposite of intuitively knowing/doing things. If that intuitive stuff doesn't come naturally to you... Really, the only problem is how long it takes for you to come to a conclusion on things. In a perfect world, you could have all the time to think and come up with the best solution or have perfect clarity over what decisions you're making. But the world isn't perfect and we run on time. If you can't seem to change your ways, consider adapting your over thinking so that it simply takes less time. You could: - lower your standards of what types of outcomes are acceptable - instead of considering ALL possibilities, pick the mindset of a person most suited for the decision making you need to do and follow what you think they would do. (This helps me a lot personally) - be more open to new things, see it as a sign of growth or opportunity for growth - do reality checks before you sink into over thinking too hard: is it worth this amount of time, effort, energy? Is picking ""the best answer"" out of what immediately comes to your mind good enough? - consider forcing a time limit on yourself. Mistakes will be made, but you will adapt. Probably the last desirable option, though, so try the others first I think  Hopefully that might help. Not even sure if I'm interpreting ""over thinking"" right lol."

Pick a few relatively unimportant things that you (or others) realize that you overthink. I don't know, maybe you take 10 minutes to order food from a menu at a new restaurant or something. Now decide that the next time you have to do this task, you will give yourself 15 seconds to make a choice. You KNOW it won't be the best choice, but it will be done and you can move on. You can now see if you can get comfortable knowing that it was not the best, but it was good enough, and you saved time (your CRITICAL limiting life factor!), and the consequences were not as bad as you feared."

You could have been born with icthyosis and died a horrible death a few days after birth.   But you weren't. You're still here, you're in good health, you have access to the internet and free time in which you can speak your mind.   Instead of focussing on why you hate yourself, focus on what makes you a great person. Are you kind, loving, funny, creative?  The next time you have the opportunity to do something novel, just fucking do it. Don't neglect to do so and then complain about having less life experience than other people.  ""This basically guarantees that my life is meant to be in the gutter"" - no, it doesn't. Your attitude towards it does.

Do not complain about the circumstances of your birth; there are millions upon millions who would die to be in your position.   Who cares if you have to work twice as hard?

DecidingToBeBetter,2yem62,kkristynn,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"You may not have the ability to do what you want as fast as you want, or as well as you want to, but you're likely capable of more than you realize given your admitted self-hate. For example, even someone who only works an hour a day could make something cool if you gave him long enough, the right tools, and knowledge on what to do. Feeling left behind sucks but, in the end, your experience is going to suck if you only focus on the people who are ahead of you. It's also a good way to get demotivated. It's like running a marathon, finishing it, being pissed to come in after others' times, and then ignoring all of the people who finished afterward.   Plus, what does it matter if you beat other people? It seems like all that would do is give you a sense of superiority and confidence. That sounds great but it doesn't seem to be working, because you're already beating millions of people and you're not happy. (There are people with worse diseases than ADHD, starving people, people living with terrible birth defects, etc.) So, maybe you need to re-examine what it would take for you to feel not left behind. Who are you comparing yourself to? Why? Is it a fair comparison to make? It's a slippery slope to compare yourself to other people like that, and it seems like a good way to never be happy. For example, if you had millions of dollars, then maybe you'd feel left behind because billionaires made more than you did. It's the same attitude.  And being reborn probably wouldn't solve your problems. You might do some things better, but it'd be like the butterfly effect. Everything you did differently would mean that your life went in new directions, and you'd have to make whole new decisions. You'd also make entirely new mistakes, and they might be worse, because no one's perfect. If life were a video game, then the map would be randomly generated. It's better to focus on what you have, rather than hypothetical situations. If you can't figure out how to make this life work, then how is it guaranteed that you'd get it right if you started all over again? Grieving over being unable to hit restart doesn't make much sense.  Plus--unless you're a very skilled ghost who's somehow accessed the internet--you'll eventually get more life experiences, and you said you wanted those. Depending on what you want to do, maybe you could try something new once a week or month, and plan for new experiences in that way. For example, you could try a new type of food, go rock climbing, or whatever.   ADHD doesn't have to ruin everything, either. You said it yourself: with ADHD, you have something where you can try. In other words, your struggle is valid, but the ability to try ""twice as hard"" still means you're not totally incapable. Instead, it means that if you are in the gutter, then you can pull yourself out of it. Also, remember that it's the people who work hard who usually make things look easy. Even a star athlete spent hours in practice. Thinking you're automatically trying ""twice as hard to achieve a quarter of the success"" is likely an illusory thought. This is because you're not pointing to a scientific study when you say that, but your own perception. Many people's hard work either isn't admitted to or isn't seen. For example, ADHD is common and a problem, but so are other conditions like depression and anxiety and eating disorders. For all you know, some guy who's surpassing you might have spent hours in therapy. Math or whatever might come naturally for him, but his condition might have stopped him as easily as ADHD would have if he let it, and he may have days where it's hard not to be stopped. There are many people like that. Generally, their problems are kept invisible because they prefer it that way. Perfect lives with perfect circumstances aren't common."

Day 1 do whatever is comfortable.  Do that for a few days, maybe a week.  Once a day (or more if you're daring) do like 8 or 9 push-ups.  Then, start increasing by one push-up every day.  So day 8 do 9 push-ups.  Day 9 do 10 push-ups, day 10 do 11, and so on.  Do this 6 days of the week and rest for one day.  If you're looking to stop ""girl"" push-ups,  maybe switch it up every other day.  15 ""girl"" push-ups one day, 2 ""real"" push-ups the next day.  Then 16 the day after then 3 the day after that.   If you find yourself plateauing, just let it happen.  Stay on the same number every day until it becomes more comfortable, then start increasing again.    It takes a lot of perseverance and I've gone on and off the regiment but it's really helpful"
DecidingToBeBetter,2yau85,hedgehog885,2,Sun Mar 8 16:53:15 2015 UTC,"Every single decent exercise site I've read suggests this - just increase your numbers by 1 every time you work out. Work out 3-4 times a week, letting muscles rest and rebuild in between.  Slow and steady, you'll get stronger.  I've been doing that and its amazing. 3 months later and I'm up to over 30 minutes of working out. And now its a habit, and forming a habit is the hardest part!"

Turns out my diet was wrong in the end (I cut off fats completely, and almost all carbs as well, which is retarded) and I would also skip cardio, which lead to me never being able to do 30 real push-ups. I chose one of the most difficult kind and I would do them 2s down, 2s up. With this knowledge I'm sure I could reach 30 now, but I moved away from the gym hype, although I should go back to doing some exercise at least twice a weak, I know how much better I'd feel."

DecidingToBeBetter,2yau85,mr-monday,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:08:35 2015 UTC,"You might find this method works for you to build strength quickly without being overwhelmed.  Do one pushup,  rest.  Now a couple seconds later,  do two pushups,  rest. Keep adding one more until you are at ten in a row.  Rest again after every increase.  Now go back down.  9, 8,7... 2,1 and you're done!   This is a pushup ladder,  and i used it in the military to go from weak to maxing out my pushups in a week or so. Doing it in small increments helps with internal motivation as well as avoiding burnout, and at the end of 1-10-1 you have done a hundred!  Either way, congrats on your achievement so far.

DecidingToBeBetter,2yf35h,carrieamedford,2,Mon Mar 9 06:45:47 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with being a psycho. I wish people would stop saying psycho, because it doesn't mean psychopath when it's watered down this way, and frankly, psychopath isn't really a good term either.  Today again I heard that the best way to tell whether someone is a sociopath (more correctly: whether someone has a lot of antisocial personality traits) is much like the way to find out if someone is a Narcissist (you ask them). It went on like this: if you ask someone whether they have empathy and they tell you no, then they are a sociopath..and so if you ask a Narcissist if they are a Narcissist, a Narcissist will say yes and be delighted you noticed (they're proud).  The big problem here though, is that someone who doesn't know what empathy is never has known what empathy is, and that's exactly what helps someone meet the criteria for antisocial personality disorder.   Also, not all people know what narcissism means, and there are a lot of people who are narcissistic with very low self-esteem, who may out themselves as Narcissists but never meet diagnostic criteria for narcissistic personality disorder.  Everyone is narcissistic to some degree (have you ever looked in the mirror for hygiene?) just like everyone is antisocial to some extent (don't tell me you've never intentionally exceeded the speed limit).   It's just a matter of the amount of this type of behavior and context.   Nothing in this blog post is consistent with science on the subject."
DecidingToBeBetter,2ycl8r,IWCtrl,1 point,Sun Mar 8 16:59:33 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts: 1 - where do you see yourself in ten years time? What do you want to be or have done? Work backwards from there and put everything in a timeline to see what you need to do next. 2 - when doing the above, you will know what you want for yourself, and what you fee obliged to do. For everything you aren't excited about, but feel like you should do, ask yourself why, and try and identify an alternative that you ARE excited about 3 - it is difficult to know what you want, when you haven't listened to your inner wants for a while. Much as you can't go to the gym and lift 100k on your first day of exercise, you won't know why you want out of life the first day you think about it. So start small. What do you want for dinner. Why? What trade offs  are you making? Why? E.g. Flavour vs cost 4 - look at your life and understand why you are doing everything you are doing. Why do you hang out with your friends? Do they make you laugh? Do they love you? Is it just because they live next door? Take apart your life choices to understand how you got where you are. Really think about this. 5 - whenever you make a choice, explain your reasons to a friend or out loud to yourself. Putting things into words will make things so much clearer to you about your motivations. The more you understand these, the better future choices you can make 6 - make a choice EVERY TIME a you get the opportunity? Steak or burgers for dinner? Who cares? YOU DO. Make a choice and have a reason, even if it is crap, but have one. No more ""you decide"". You can always let someone else make the decision if You would rather keep them happy or if it is what you prefer, but at least practise making the decision and expressing an opinion."

""Hello is this the ife catalog hot-line? Yes, I'll be returning to the states soon and I'd like 1 high paying job, doing something I love and if people can give me a lot of respect with that I'd appreciate it.""   You say you know the meaning of hard-work and respect, which tells me it's something you crave now. Do you want to know how to get it? It's not just working hard. You have to work for it. Be reliable. With reliability comes responsibility. Dont dick people around. Don't ignore phone calls. If something is your fault, own up to it. Be straight-forward with people. Treat people(not just people you want something from. EVERYONE) with respect. Have compassion for people. Be passionate about what you do. If you want to be proud of what you do; be sure to do something not just that you can brag about, but something that helps people and fulfills you.   Respect and hard work come from within. Hard work is a skill that needs to be practiced. Respect comes from respecting others. And someone with self respect doesn't crave need a strangers respect or superficial respect(as in people only respecting you for your status, or wealth)."

I would say to myself that the anxiety was a mind trick someone was playing on me.  All I had to do to break the spell was to try.  Somehow this conjured up enough anger in me to defeat my foe, and I was able to try.  Once I got started, I could go longer than I expected before the distracting thoughts bombarded me again.  I call them my Distractor Demons.  I treat them like they are an external entity as well.  I know that they are illogical and they are nothing like my true self, so I separate them in my head.  If they really start to get to me, I ""yell"" shut up in my head.  I tell them that I'm going to work for 5 minutes and they can't stop me.    I know it sounds insane, but it helps me.  This kind of anxiety isn't a real emotion.  It's a trick your brain is playing on you so you avoid something it perceives as a threat.  Your subconscious will not trust you to take care of yourself that way.  This is a learned emotion, and it can be overcome.  Hang in there."

Do not look for a secret or a shortcut or a way to continue to do what you are already doing and have it be successful.   The line that was posted the other day: If you change nothing, nothing changes."
DecidingToBeBetter,2y8hnl,milojoker,2,Sat Mar 7 18:33:02 2015 UTC,Hypnosis can be used to minimize anxiety and to help with motivation as well. First thing that comes to mind since I'm a hypnotherapist.
DecidingToBeBetter,2y8hnl,milojoker,1 point,Sat Mar 7 19:07:48 2015 UTC,It seems like an interesting possibility. Is there any chance for me to perform autohypnosis?
DecidingToBeBetter,2y8hnl,sblaptopman,3,Sat Mar 7 19:28:54 2015 UTC,"Of course, here is a detailed guide on self hypnosis: http://www.hypnosiseveryday.com/how-to-do-self-hypnosis/  The key is to work on 1 thing at a time. Don't overwhelm yourself with suggestions: I want to run faster, sing louder, smile more, eat healthy, sleep better. Pick one thing and work on that for 2-3 weeks doing self hypnosis every other day. If you can do it once a day, then that's even better"
