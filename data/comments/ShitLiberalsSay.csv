It was this idea that slavery was justified because it elevated their [the slaves] material conditions slightly for those who would have had no jobs, that they would be worse off without it.  It's an logically caustic argument, which fails to address the systemic abuse in typical, liberal fashion. Capitalism begets worker competition, but we just need minimum wage laws in foreign countries, that'll surely stop the exploitation!"

Since citizens no longer have an economic incentive to work, there is no way to keep all of the populace working without resorting to the threat of punishment. Karl Marx describes it as the ""equal obligation of all to work"" rather than explicitly naming the use of force, but as with many of his other proposals, it is a half-baked and half-formed idea, lacking the courage to explicitly name the unpleasant mechanisms required for implementation.

It portrayed brutal racism and subtler forms of bigotry faced by black americans in the 20th century and envisioned the 21st century as a hyper capitalist shithole where poor people are rounded up into lawless enclaves where they murder each over scraps while the rest of society simply calls them lazy bums and don't give a fuck. Rom also leads a workers strike and launches the first successful labor movemnment in Ferengi history. Section 31 is also a good analogy for the CIA, support the idealized life of its citizens through clandestine terror campaigns and assassinations.

ShitLiberalsSay,3dx78w,jailbot,4,Mon Jul 20 20:54:11 2015 UTC,"If all that had actually been intended as an incisive commentary on the idealism of Roddenberry-era Trek, that'd be true. But to me it just looks like a failure of imagination on the part of the DS9 writers. They set out to make Star Trek more ""realistic,"" and the only realistic world in their minds was a neoliberal one. For all Roddenberry's many faults, he at least had the ability to comprehend that people will be different when they're living under different material circumstances. Just as a medieval peasant and a 21st century industrial worker would be incomprehensible to each other, that same 21st century worker would seem very alien to someone in the 24th century (and vice versa). His notions of exactly how that would happen and what form it would take were silly and idealistic, sure, but in some ways preferable to the DS9 writers' assumption that neoliberal individualism and military/security statehood will persist indefinitely into the future (part of that, of course, is also Roddenberry's fault; he was in the Navy, so he conceived of Starfleet as a navy, which was his failure of imagination).  There's obviously no guarantee that whatever economic arrangement we have 400 years from now will be communism, but we can practically guarantee that it won't be capitalism. Of course, even in DS9 whatever system the Federation has probably can't meaningfully be called capitalism (it's hard to tell; things like Sisko's father having a restaurant really muddy the issue), and yet the superstructure is virtually identical with some minor tweaks. It's like bad historical fiction that simply reflects the modern sensibilities of the writer but with different costumes, only projected into the future instead of the past.  Roddenberry tried. He failed miserably because he was a drug-addled liberal, but he tried. The DS9 writers just shrugged and said, ""lol I guess there'll always be the same ol' shit because human nature, y'know?""  Two points in closing:  1) I'm not at all a fan of the notion that science fiction should be a reflection of modern issues and problems but with spaceships. This is related to the historical fiction analogy above. Extrapolating from modern conditions via science fiction is great; taking modern conditions and slapping lasers on it is intellectually lazy. This is why LeGuin is one of my favorite authors. Even Frank Herbert with his weird feudal fantasies knew better, though. Science fiction doesn't have to labor under the burden of being ""topical.""  2) All that being said, you make a lot of good points that really affect how I look at DS9."

No and no. In Star Trek, there were currencies, references made to it, and using it. An example would be latinum as a currency to either use or purchase credits. Gold is also seen as valuable to people in Star Trek. The people working on whichever starship got paid a fee depending on their rankings and if they didn't, there are references made to them potentially being homeless. There's also a shitload of private industries. They don't have unlimited resources and the replicators can't replicate everything. There also a court system, military, police, legislature, president, and all the rad things that make up a state. It's also imperialist as fuck.

ShitLiberalsSay,3dx78w,zootrouble,4,Mon Jul 20 20:01:06 2015 UTC,"I was particularly referencing the federation, which doesn't have currency. The Ferengi and certain other species used currency and placed value on things but they clashed with the federation and humans a lot. Picard specifically states in First Contact that there is no money in the federation. Everyone also has equal rights to resources in this system also. There really isn't supposed to be any class system or inequality on Earth, etc.  Within the Federation, they eliminated poverty, disease, homelessness, currency, resource scarcity... But it was injected into the plot line sometimes to make for an interesting and relatable show. The show would have been dull to average audiences without conflict and negative circumstances."
ShitLiberalsSay,3dx78w,captainmaryjaneway,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:29 2015 UTC,"Then it would seem they're being entirely inconsistent as the currency they used was Federation credits and it's referenced in TOS, TNG, Voyager, and DS9. Not that that'd be unusual for that show to be inconsistent, considering the Borg in Enterprise, but in TNG, no one knew what they were and the computer had no records of the Borg. :P   They used the Federation credits for the same reason we use money today. Even people on the starships were paid in credits based on whatever their rank was and credits was used to train people to be on the starship. For instance, the people in charge of who was to be on the Enterprise in TOS, invested credits in Spock to have him perform as expected, Uhura bought a tribble, Kirk sold his house, Scotty bought a boat...etc. In TNG, Picard was purchasing old artifacts he found interesting, the Federation was paying some planet to keep a wormhole open, mom Crusher was using credits to purchase clothing. In DS9, Sisko kept telling Quark he better pay up the back rent he had for his bar and Sisko's son was always talking about selling shit. Voyager is a bit different because they were lost in capitalistic space because the rest of the galaxy is capitalist apparently, so they had to do what they had to do to return home."

Most people wouldn't watch the show if it came off as a complete utopia. Star Trek was made in the late 60s after all. Most of the audience wouldn't put up with straight up in your face classless, stateless, peaceful plot line.  Roddenberry did try to make it classless, stateless and peaceful but the writers had nothing to work with and would complain a lot."

You can argue that Star Trek depicts some kind of utopian communism (Marxism is a specific strain of communism and is not utopian, incidentally), although as you pointed out, the individual writers tended to muddy those waters quite a bit, but there's absolutely no evidence that Roddenberry had read a single word of Marx or that Marxism was any kind of influence on Star Trek. That's what I was responding to - Mike Wong's bizarre insistence on tying Star Trek directly to the ideas of Karl Marx."
