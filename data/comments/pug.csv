pug,3d0ucm,jonandlind,9,Sun Jul 12 16:02:19 2015 UTC,"One piece of advice is watch them during hot days. By hot I mean to pugs, mine start panting around 78-79 F. My smallest one loves to sunbathe (I know she is an idiot). If it's 85+ degrees outside we let her out, give her 5 mins and call her back in. They are  intolerant to the heat and need you to be mindful for them.  Other than that, clean their folds, teeth, eyes, and ears regularly. Make sure to scratch their butts, it's a requirement. =)"

The shedding on the other hand is something you get used to, we call it pugfur. They are great and loving dogs that can be best friends, remember they overheat easily and love to snort and snore."

Pugs are predisposed to hip dysplasia. Stubbornness:  Yup.  That's part of their character.  It does make them harder to train.  Shedding:  Pug fur EVERYWHERE."

pug,3d0ucm,melissa714,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:32:51 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it referring to common illnesses, more like ones such as aortic stenosis, ear infections, and brachycephalic syndrome, along with some other ones such as hip dysplasia, which you mentioned. Pugs are predisposed to a lot of illnesses that are uncommon in other breeds, and there really are few ways of preventing them, as a lot are genetic."
pug,3d0ucm,Runmenot,2,Mon Jul 13 05:57:04 2015 UTC,"One of mine has spring allergies. The other has only been sick once in five years. That was after having surgery to shorten his soft palate.  I think his immune system was just weak at that point.   One reason he had the surgery is that like many pugs, there is no quit in him.  His sister is the same way.  If they are having fun they don't know when to quit and can overheat. Bubba was almost completely ineffective at panting to cool himself until after the surgery.  The one downside, he doesn't snore anymore.  Pug snores are quite comforting.   My pugs will do anything for a treat. They were incredibly easy to train. You do have to be firm, but in no way unkind.  They try to be stubborn, but they respect the alpha. When they hear my tone start to change they immediately do as I say. I have never had to punish them, and I think doing so would be counterproductive.  They are somewhat sensitive that way.     One other thing on training; my pugs could only really concentrate on training for about 15 minutes at a time.  Anything over that was counterproductive.  Dogs Of other breeds I've  had in the past were still going strong at 30."
pug,3d0ucm,msundi83,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:36:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah you just have to be careful with extremes of weather.  They can't really handle a long walk in the heat.  They will eat and eat and eat so just find a consistant diet.  I feed mine twice a day and he maintains a healthy weight and is very happy despite wanting to still eat everything in sight.  I got mine when he was four and he was not trained much if at all (puppy mill dog).  It took patience to housebreak him, but he is more or less trained today.  I have a friend who got hers as a puppy and her dog is perfectly trained.  One thing im sure someone else will mention is they have lots of folds in their faces that can get infected and so I like to clean his face as best i can in between baths/grooming.  They have eyes that stick out and are more vulnerable so keep caution around new animals (cats).  One more thing i think.  I have another friend whose pug loved to jump from high distances and pound onto the floor.  After 5 years of this he hurt his back and actually needed surgery.  Mine did this too so i got a set of steps for a few of the places he regularly like to sit. If you let your pug in your bed or on funature you may consider this or not...I'm not sure if her case was a fluke.  Good luck with the new dog.  They are loyal and hilarious.  Any frustrations they may cause are worth it.  Edit...one more thing.  Mine has gotten ear infections before.  Once i started regularly cleaning his ears out with washing solution from my vet this stoped."
pug,3d0ucm,Greenheartpuglover,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:14:35 2015 UTC,"Hi! Really congrats, pugs are one of the best breeds, yes they have respiratory issues, but they can be as fit as you if you take them for walks every day. Also, always clean very well their faces EVERYWHERE or they could get an infection, and always keep those folds neat and dry. My pug used to be very stubborn but she learned how to pee in the right place and all, also yes they shed a lot but black pugs shed less. Dont forget to give them tons of love since they are great companions and for sure youll have tons of funny moments. Also you can check on youtube pug 101 from animal planet :)"

pug,3d0ucm,Frozty23,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:25:27 2015 UTC,"Since no one has addressed it regarding sickness; all three of our pugs have been prone to ear infections. We keep a couple of bottles of Tresaderm (from our vet) on hand to treat at the earliest signs of trouble. Works like a charm, usually by next day.  We were on vacation once years ago when one of them began getting signs of an ear infection. Since we didn't have a bottle of Tresaderm with us (it needs to be kept refrigerated) we called to try to go to a local vet to just get a bottle but they wanted a full blown new patient appointment and exam ($150), if/when they could fit us into their schedule if we came in and waited stand-by. We were two days from going home, so just waited it out... even in just two days the infection got extremely nasty and took another full week to cure. Now Tresaderm is always part of the vacation cold pack for us.  Keep those ears clean and nip those ear infections in the bud!"
pug,3d0ucm,Frozty23,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:23:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! Was wondering when you said ear infection, will cleaning their ears and face everyday helps to prevent those infections?"
pug,3d0ucm,rebelreligion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:14:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why you have to stay on top of keeping them clean.  Our pugs' ears' skin is really white when healthy... when it turns pink or red, that's trouble brewing."
pug,3d0ucm,lennypoo2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:45:20 2015 UTC,"I got her from a great breeder who raised and showed pugs and my pug was very healthy except for on-going ear infections.  I am certain her groomer got her ears wet when she bathed her monthly and her ears were button-style covering the opening of the ear and keeping in moisture.  You have to make sure the nose wrinkle is cleaned daily or the pug will be smelly.  Oh, and don't forget the anal glands.  I fed my pug extra fiber in her food and veggies, but still had to have them 'expressed' by the groomer or vet. All said and done she was the best dog breed for me.  She was funny, cuddly and sweet.  She was easy to train and loved being around other dogs at the park.  Mine loved to be on a floatie in the pool or laying on the air conditioning vent in the summer and in front of the fireplace in the winter. Be prepared to fall in love with your pug!"
pug,3d0ucm,elfwicket,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:36:32 2015 UTC,"I am so excited for you you have to post a pic of him or her when you get that sweet little baby you're going to absolutely ADORE it! The only thing I really have to add is although it can happen to other breeds as well my pug was diagnosed with diabetes. We found out because he actually almost died,  he was drinking a TON of water at a time, and losing weight very rapidly. The vet finally found out that he was diabetic which explained the excessive thirst. Now we give him insulin shots twice a day so that's something to be cautious of and not just with pugs but just with any dog in general that drinks and drinks constantly. But other than their stubbornness I don't know I kind of like the stubbornness it's what makes them unique 😍I always tell my husband that he is little pug with big attitude."
pug,3d0ucm,elfwicket,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:09:08 2015 UTC,"No long walks. Short is better. I like to walk mine is smaller increments during the day (7-10 minutes in the morning, midday (if I'm not working), evenings after dinner, and night before bed).  The clicker didn't work as well as food for incentive to learn tricks. When my pug knows there's food, he pretty much immediately listens to commands. If he thinks there's no food, he's much more reluctant and seems to have this attitude that says, ""I'm going to wait to see how much you really want me to do this trick. That badly, huh? Well okay I suppose,"" then he very slowly and lazily does his trick.  I don't bother brushing because he seems to just shed the normal amount. I just make sure I vacuum about once a week. Accept the fact that no matter where you are, you will have pug hair. My fiancé and I had gone to Germany and we put freshly laundered clothes into our suitcases and somehow we managed to find dog hair on us anyway. Oh and know that you'll probably end up eating it without even realizing it. It gets everywhere.  They are loud breathers even when sleeping, but you'll get used to it. My fiancé describes it as like going camping. You get this strange feeling until you realize that what you don't hear is all the city traffic and noise.  Quick edit: my pug is 6 and hasn't gotten sick (knock on wood). Regular check ups and he's perfectly fine. Make sure you regulate his/her food. Some dogs do okay with a bowl of food left out all day. Not pugs. They will eat their entire bowl in seconds (I recommend a slow feeder bowl. It also technically reduces the amounts of farts, but we had taken care of that years ago when we changed dog food brands) then act like their starving anyway.  Also, get a body harness and do not attach the leash to the collar."
pug,3d0ucm,airwolff,2,Sun Jul 12 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! And when you said use a body harness, is it true that using a  leash to the collar causes their eyes to pop out more?"

You don't do that...""  or whatever you tell her when you want to let her know not to do something. Remove her yourself if that doesn't work but be a little rough.

Pugs can be weird about that stuff sometimes. It's usually temporary. One of my Pugs was like that with our Lab rescue, he is the size of a small pony. After time they got used to each other and boundaries were set and now they are fast friends. Give it time and make sure to give the Pug lots of loves. Also make an effort to play with them together little bits at a time so the Pug realizes the puppy is a new member of the pack and not a intruder."

pug,3a7u3r,faithisrealcool,2,Thu Jun 18 01:32:49 2015 UTC,"We have three pugs... two are brothers we've had since pups and are age 10. One has no interest in toys, except for his one toy that he has had his whole life. To the other everything is a toy to be played with. Our third pug is a rescue we've had for two years (he was kept outdoors in a crate and used for breeding is our guess, until age 5), and he is just starting to discover and gain an interest in toys at age 7."

pug,3a4u3s,pullacatengo,5,Wed Jun 17 06:08:02 2015 UTC,Eli was recently diagnosed with a luxated patella. Turns out his tendons are actually tilorn behind his knee and he needs surgery. I have Googled some to see if any organizations out there might be able to help with the cost but didn't find much. Have any of you experience or knowledge of any organizations that could help? I just want him to be better soon and the surgery is pricey. He helped me through cancer and I want to help him though this. Thanks in advance.
pug,3a4u3s,Thepaladinofchaos,3,Wed Jun 17 06:11:25 2015 UTC,I think your best bet is some kind of group funding thing or setting up a donation drive in the community. I'm so sorry to hear this and I hope the little guy gets the help he needs

I was looking for a pug for my fiancé and came across him in an ad. Wasn't until I went to see him that I became aware of his condition. Couldn't leave him there. We went straight to the vet.

pug,2rh5s9,SirSaif,1 point,Tue Jan 6 03:37:26 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thanks so much. I didn't know there was r/pugs, only r/pug.  I live in Southern California so harsh weather isn't too much of a problem , although it is the cold season. What I am more concerned with is when I have to work. I work in the film industry and that means long hours.  Minimum of at least 12 on a normal work day.  Fortunately I live with 2 roommates, one who is a dog owner as well and we had a third roommate that moved out but he had a pug. So far Marty has been doing well in his crate, there was one mishap in which he peed because i put him there for a short moment while we had to move furniture and i guess he grew anxious. But thanks for all the info!  I truly appreciate it!"
pug,2rh5s9,evfuwy,1 point,Tue Jan 6 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"I would say yes. The breeders that I got him from crate train their dogs.  Yesterday was the first day at his new home and he did very well throughout the night.  He whines just a little bit when i put him in but calms down very quickly when I'm laying in bed next to him. Honestly I only want to crate train him so he learns good potty habits and because he is so young.  The last pug that lived here wasn't crate trained at all, there were definitely mishaps but by the time he moved out he was more or less house trained and could be left alone in the house uncrated (although occasional mishaps would still occur) . Its uncommon, but i know there will be those days where all three of us will be working so I'm thinking about splitting the difference.  Not crating him but also not letting him have the whole house to wander maybe section off half of my room?. But for now when he's very young, the crate training is working. Also good tip on the Kong toy, always thought those were just chew toys but now i read what they're about and i think thats a little better than just a nylabone."

pug,2ql6hd,lilmiss7citiez,4,Sun Dec 28 14:47:51 2014 UTC,"Usually seizures are controlled easily with phenobarbital. I had a pug with epilepsy and those meds helped a ton. Also, keep a log of his activity....when he has a seizure, how far apart, how long do they last, etc. Try to pinpoint anything he may do before he has a seizure. All that will help the specialist. Mine would lay down and vigorously chew at his feet a few minutes before. Have a thick blanket around and ready so when he does have a seizure, you can throw it over him and hold him down. This will prevent him from hurting himself and you."

pug,2p4obs,Protanope,5,Sat Dec 13 10:47:33 2014 UTC,"i highly doubt any knee surgery is life threatening.  it probably has a cruciate tear and needs a $1-2k surgery that honestly isnt even necessary.  the body will produce enough scar tissue in most cases to provide stability to the joint to such extent that the surgery is not always necessary.  if your vet is saying it is 100% necessary...you may want to get a second opinion from an experienced orthopedic surgeon.  the last clinic i worked at brought an ortho in for surgeries such as this and did them for significantly cheaper than most places, under 4 figures in fact."
pug,2p4obs,Computerzzz,0,Sat Dec 13 12:30:50 2014 UTC,"This is the most experienced vet facility in the region, and we have also done alot of research and consulted people knowledgable about both the breed and this specific conditon. If we didn't feel there was any hope of recovery, or the surgery was unecessary, we would either have put her down to spare her the pain, or considered other treatment.  Also, we live in Norway, where putting dogs up for adoption is just as risky, as the few animal rescue organizations here don't have a lot of money, and are more inclined to put the animals down than give them expensive surgery or put them up for adoption."

Everyone who has met him, from the vet office, neighbors, to even my mother, has said what a really pleasant dog he is. Even with a rather exciting/stressful day he was wonderful.

pug,2o7xm4,storm_queen,1 point,Thu Dec 4 19:18:29 2014 UTC,Owner didn't have much info on him. Didn't matter though. Saw that face and knew we'd deal with whatever.
pug,2o7xm4,Vilens40,5,Fri Dec 5 14:59:13 2014 UTC,"wow, that looks exactly like my pug crazy.   There generally isn't much they'll be able to tell you if they just got him that you won't figure out pretty quick.   It might be good to know if he's used to having other dogs around. My pug is a follower and would go insane alone."
pug,2o7xm4,40nSporty,4,Thu Dec 4 03:09:05 2014 UTC,Thanks. We have two young teens and a couple cats. One of the cats thinks he's a dog so the pug will have plenty of activity and companionship. Looking forward to being a pug family.
pug,2o7xm4,boochix,2,Thu Dec 4 04:04:49 2014 UTC,"I do know you're in for a real treat :) I got my Pug at two years old and it was a great decision.

pug,2nhl6g,prettyjewish,2,Wed Nov 26 16:16:29 2014 UTC,My old pug had something similar minus the green discharge. He couldn't move he only moved a little on his front feet but couldn't get from point A to point B. His back legs were definitely hurting and he wouldn't poo but he did pee. We found out he had really bad arthritis in his hind legs/hips. The vet thought he wasn't pooping since he couldn't stand long enough. But he was 13 close to 14 so it was understandable he would have arthritis. If you're dog is young that might not be it but your vet will be able to know. Also when the vet diagnosed him he gave our pug anti-inflammatory meds and then later pain meds and lived completely normally for several years.

pug,2n7stl,2dogmoon,3,Mon Nov 24 00:53:53 2014 UTC,"Pugs won't protect your house. Every pug owner I know will agree with me when I say that they love people so much they'd probably go home with anyone, even if that person was breaking into your house. Although they are really good alert dogs. If my dog hears something unusual he definitely let's me know about it."
pug,2n7stl,CamembertFiend,1 point,Mon Nov 24 07:38:00 2014 UTC,Maybe consider a mixed breed? Puggles are pretty common and would probably be easier to find. I think it's more important you find a reputable breeder when it comes to health concerns. Avoid puppy mills/craigslist/petfinder. You should be able to see the home the dog comes from (assuming you don't get a shelter dog)
pug,2n7stl,armamentarium,2,Mon Nov 24 04:07:28 2014 UTC,Even with a mixed breed with a longer snout there's no guarantee you'll get off scott free with the breathing and eye issues that pugs are so famous for. I have a friend who has a pugalier (50/50) with a longer snout and she still required surgery to rectify breathing issues.
pug,2n7stl,CamembertFiend,1 point,Mon Nov 24 07:42:21 2014 UTC,"i did look at a couple mixed options, but puggles to me always look very angry, their face is not appealing at all imo. i googled a chi pug and they look weird too. i also dont want to chance not having the other nice attributes of a pug which is up in the air with a mix. and its not very easy if possible at all to find a reputable place when getting a mix dog"
pug,2n7stl,armamentarium,1 point,Mon Nov 24 04:16:16 2014 UTC,"It's definitely not difficult to ensure you're going to a reputable place. Visit the home they're coming from. Ask how many litters they do a year (shouldn't be more than 1 or 2 tops) look at the living conditions it's coming from. Do they have a large backyard? Are the dogs you meet friendly and well socialized? There should be 100% transparency.  I think your best bet is to go for either a ""Victorian"" pug or just go for a mixed . There will always be some degree of temperament regardless of the breed. Even a longer snouted pug comes with possible health risks (eye issues are a good example of another extremely common  and expensive ailment of pugs)"
pug,2n7stl,armamentarium,1 point,Mon Nov 24 05:54:49 2014 UTC,"To be honest, pugs aren't really hiking type dogs even with a longer snout. Have you considered maybe a greyhound? They make amazing apartment dogs, are very lazy most of the day and are still able and down to go on more physically demanding outings."
pug,2n7stl,armamentarium,1 point,Mon Nov 24 05:57:27 2014 UTC,"oh im not a hiker, i didnt mean to give that impression, a walk in the park or some time at the beach is my adventure, i live in florida so there really isnt any terrain for hiking. greyhounds are too big for me and the italian greyhounds look to be too timid, i did consider them though but every picture i see of them they look like they want to hide under a rock somewhere"

I didn't realize they were poisonous to dogs until I noticed he picked one up when excitedly playing and didnt even chew it before he swallowed it which he didn't mean to do as he gagged when it happened. But fast forward a few days and he is slowing down, tired and not himself, then he starts puking after he eats (2X a day). We call the doctor after this happened daily. We were told to give him a bland diet and they prescribed a medicine that coats his stomach before he eats to see if that helps.  It did seem to help and after the 2nd day of that I saw that he needed to puke and took him outside and he vomited up an acorn.... I am convinced that it was the same acorn. He rebounded immediately."

I know it's hard when puggies get sick since they're usually so happy all the time.

pug,2kqq0q,Van_Gundy,2,Thu Oct 30 13:59:17 2014 UTC,I got it at Pet Co. randomly yesterday. It looks like you can find it on their site here.  I should say that it doesn't really fit or stay on him that well. Immediately after this picture I gave him the treat I was holding to get him to sit still and he shook the hat off :)
pug,2kqq0q,LibraryFreakandGeek,1 point,Thu Oct 30 15:56:05 2014 UTC,Oh my god where did you get that sweater? I love it!
pug,2kqq0q,LibraryFreakandGeek,1 point,Thu Oct 30 14:36:46 2014 UTC,"I got it in a Pet Co. store randomly, yesterday. Here is the direct link to the sweater on their site.  The less stretchy jackets don't really fit pugs well since they're so small but have barrel chests. So when I saw this small knit sweater I picked it up and it fits great!"

pug,2kiyvo,larinaluv,2,Tue Oct 28 15:44:00 2014 UTC,So sorry man. Pugs are amazing dogs and it doesn't seem fair that the lives of dogs are so short when they bring so much happiness.

pug,2j96st,mirandawrites,2,Tue Oct 14 22:48:17 2014 UTC,"When I was researching pugs, one excellent piece of advice I came across was, ""Never walk a pug further than you are willing to carry them.""  Mine however, is fine walking for a mile in one direction, but if you stop at the half mile mark and try to turn around, she'll stop every ten feet the entire way home. I've learned to walk her around the neighborhood in a loop instead of down the block and back.  Gotta love pugs and their stubborn little attitudes."
