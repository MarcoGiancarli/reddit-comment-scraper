FoodPorn,3dykkw,tp488,2,Mon Jul 20 23:36:05 2015 UTC,What's the difference between hong shao rou and lu rou?
FoodPorn,3dykkw,Demento56,8,Mon Jul 20 20:35:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert on Chinese food and I'm not sure what what you mean by lu rou, but I am Chinese so I'll give this a stab.   Hong shao rou refers to a specific style of cooking in which pork belly is braised for a long time, which causes the skin and the fat to melt in your mouth while the meat stays covered in the braising liquid. The braising liquid turns the pork red, which is where the process gets its name.   Lu rou, on the other hand, could refer to a number of things.    It could be venison, although I'm not sure about this because deer aren't hugely popular as food in any part of China that I know of.  It could refer to meat that's cooked on a stove (lu zi in Chinese), although that's a really generic term and could also be applied to hong shao rou.  It could be lu rou fan, which is minced pork rice. Its exact composition varies, but it always involves minced pork boiled in soy sauce and served on top of steamed rice. I've had a few different varieties of this too, and I actually like this better than hong shao rou."
FoodPorn,3dykkw,Hongxiquan,3,Mon Jul 20 21:15:15 2015 UTC,the techniques are related (braising in soy sauce) lu rou is probably the parent style (which is red braising in english)

Drop the cubes into boiling water and blanch for 1-2 minutes, then drain.   Heat a wok with the oil and the sugar until the sugar starts to darken. Add the pork cubes and brown them.   Add all the liquid ingredients, stir well and simmer until the pork is tender, the fat is gelatinous and the sauce is reduced to coat the pork (this is what you are meant to do). Instead, because I was cooking it for my lunch and my family's dinner that evening, I just put it all in a slow cooker.

I had it with red rice and spring greens stir-fried with shiitake mushrooms and garlic in oyster sauce."

FoodPorn,3dykkw,Death_of_Marat,-10,Mon Jul 20 21:30:02 2015 UTC,"I don't get how adding 3 spoons of light soy AFTER you've added 4 of dark soy means anything to this recipe. Such a large amount of dark soy completely obliterates the light soy.  Also pretty sure you can remove that first boil pork to remove scum step. AFAIK this is a common Asian idea that you're 'cleaning' the meat. It's a dark sauce, you're not doing anything with that step."
FoodPorn,3dykkw,alohroh,4,Mon Jul 20 23:22:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you can taste both things in a 3:4 ratio.....  Also the ""light"" soy is used for salinity. The ""dark"" soy gives the dish color and sweetness. They are quite different tasting and not interchangeable in usage.  And ""boiling off the first"" as you mention isn't only an Asian idea. Many Western countries practice that, particularly France. Removing the first rids of impurities, dirt, bone fragments, congealed blood, etc.... Although I agree that largely you won't taste a difference in this case."
FoodPorn,3dykkw,d3rtus,6,Tue Jul 21 01:13:07 2015 UTC,Dark and light soy sauce taste very different. Each are pretty essential if you're looking to achieve that specific flavor of this dish.
FoodPorn,3dykkw,rutgrrrrr,-7,Mon Jul 20 23:32:48 2015 UTC,a quarter cup of dark would completely annihilate the flavor introduced from 3 spoons of light. I don't believe it has any effect. Any claims one can taste 3 spoons of light soy mixed in 4 of dark are bullshit.
FoodPorn,3dykkw,d3rtus,3,Mon Jul 20 23:56:03 2015 UTC,How is 4 tbsp of dark going to completely overwhelm 3 tbsp of light?
FoodPorn,3dykkw,SaturatedEel,-6,Tue Jul 21 00:34:54 2015 UTC,Easy; Dark is super strong and overpowering vs. light. Obviously you've never used both if you think only the amount is meaningful. Or you're imagining you can taste it (you can't).
