ShingekiNoKyojin,3e0hu6,herminipper,14,Tue Jul 21 00:38:14 2015 UTC,"Unless becoming a Titan is because of some contagion, then it's not a contest. Modern artillery would make really short work of any Titans, not even accounting for things like cruise missiles, tanks, aircraft (especially close air support aircraft) or even nuclear weapons. Really, any military post American Civil War (maybe even before that) would make light work of Titans since they charge on sight. It'd be like an early WWI battle."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3e0hu6,hedonismbot89,5,Tue Jul 21 02:02:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, the mid 1800s already had Gatling guns and pretty accurate cannons, so yeah, even then, humanity should win a majority of the time."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3e0hu6,asianedy,4,Tue Jul 21 03:10:49 2015 UTC,"I was thinking after the birth of the Armstrong Gun in the mid 1850s since it could be reloaded faster than muzzle loading artillery, but, yeah, it'd probably be like the First Battle of the Somme where wave after wave of oncoming men were butchered."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3e0hu6,hedonismbot89,0,Tue Jul 21 04:00:40 2015 UTC,"A modern military could maybe win. If we aren't talking about too many titans. The thing is that we wouldn't know that the nape was the key to destroying them straight away, and while tanks and artillery are good and all they still wouldn't actually kill anything unless they hit and destroyed the nape. Which by the way would be a lot easier said than done considering how quick titans can move when they need to and that they usually don't attack alone.   The thing with aircraft is also that while the titans can't hurt the actual planes it wouldn't be very easy to prevent their air bases from being gradually overrun and destroyed as the titans spread across the world. Likewise with fuel and ammunition depots for the rest of the military. Nukes would be almost completely useless really, at most you would destroy a couple dozen of them per nuke or so, which isn't very good considering how expensive nukes are and that relatively few of them exist. If you bombed them while they were attacking a city and thus were a larger group you could kill more, but at that point you now have just nuked your own city in the process.  But yes, if there only are a couple of million titans or so it would probably be doable to defeat them, though after very heavy (mainly civilian) casualties.   19th century-early 20th century military though? Not a chance. Gatling guns or machine guns would be pretty useless against all but the smallest titans and trenches + barbed wire would do nothing at all to stop their advance. Anything except the artillery wouldn't really be able to do anything to hurt them and even artillery batteries would only be able to get off a little more effective fire than the SNK cannons before the titans reached them. Keep in mind that hitting moving targets with indirect fire is hard even today, and that you would also need direct hits on the nape to get a kill. It would be the equivalent of trying to take out tanks or armoured fighting vehicles with artillery barrages today, i.e. not very easy at all."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3e0hu6,Fat_Pink_Mast_,4,Tue Jul 21 11:48:21 2015 UTC,"You are underestimating modern day miltary equipment. There's no need to get the nape when the whole body is vaporized by explosives. We had the capability ever since the late 1800s. Incendiary mortars and pellet shots are pretty damn effective. And our cannons back then could pick off individual men. Also, a 50 cal bullet would be enough to destroy the nape, if they found out about it.  Also, you think nukes would only vaporize that little? Maybe you forgot how powerful those things are. And defending the bases is pretty easy if those titans dont aim for them. Not many people live there, and they also have AA defenses to thin them out. So when you say that the modern day military has no chance, you're ignoring some of the logical defenses."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3e0hu6,asianedy,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:31:31 2015 UTC,"There is no way that a mortar or artillery shell would vaporize the whole body of a titan as large as a 5 storey building. Most likely it would blow off the part of the body it hit and riddle the rest with shrapnel, all of which would be regenerated within a couple of minutes. They already shoot explosive shells at the titans in SNK and they don't do much. Cannons can only pick off individual men when they fire directly, which in military terms means within visual range. This means that they would only be between a few hundred meters to a kilometer or two from the titans depending on the terrain, meaning that they would have very little time to shoot them down before the titans reached them and ate them. If you instead fire indirectly, which is the common way to use artillery, you can shoot much further than that but then you just bombard the general area you have heard the enemy is in, and getting a direct hit on something comes down to luck. Now against regular humans you don't actually need direct hits to kill them, but against tanks, APCs or titans... this is not the case.   As for nuclear weapons a 300-500 kiloton nuke (which is pretty average nowadays) creates a fireball with a diameter of a kilometre or two. This is probably what the lethal zone is for titans. Outside of this zone you get heat waves, air blast waves and so on that can be deadly to humans (though it is possible to survive them with serious injuries) but I doubt they would be very dangerous to titans. I don't think something that can take an explosive cannonball to the face and keep on coming is going to die to something that gives a human third degree burns. In fact dozens of titans is probably an overstatement for how many you'd kill on average unless they are concentrating for an attack somewhere. A 2km wide circle would hardly have dozens of titans in it otherwise, more like just a couple perhaps? Either way pretty bad weapons against them. AA defenses on air bases wouldn't do much against titans either, since titans aren't airplanes. But yeah, a modern military would definitely have a chance and I wrote that. An 19th century - early 20th century military though? No."

Of course the characters could have other sexualities aside from hetero/homo, but I really don't see them as proper arguments in attempts to validate ships, especially when sexualities do not matter (and especially when Freckles is specifically stated to be in love with Tiny).  Also, I don't understand the Bert/Freckles ship. I was told that some people like their dynamics, but the only 'dynamics' I can find within their interactions is: 1. Manga Spoilers 2.

I usually don't give two hoots what people ship but in this case, Reiner even jokes about Ymirs sexuality (""You don't look like a girl who is interested in guys"") - heavily implying or even confirming that she's a lesbian, so I don't think her orientation is up to debate in her case. Making arguments (like the OP) as to why she ""could fall for Bertolt/any male character"" nonsensical."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,YumiruHisutoria,3,Mon Jul 20 23:21:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   The argument of ""Well, they could have [Random] sexuality and could fall for [Random character]"" is already pointless, but with Freckle's case especially.   Although it is perfectly fine to headcanon characters with particular sexualities in a way to describe how you may see them, based on their own canonically fluid sexualities, using it for a debate is pointless and in no way helps an argument (though, with the exception of Freckle's case because it has been stated, confirmed, and heavily implied that she is both a lesbian and in love with Krista)."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,pwnagekitten,4,Tue Jul 21 01:42:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah...ship/like what you want but erasing what is canon and trying to find arguments against it is hilarious/pathetic. I mean, I like the idea of Levi/Hange, or Armin/Annie but I can't find evidence to support them in the canon, so it stays that - a crackship.  I'm gonna have to open a popcorn stand for season 2! Gonna be fun!   with the exception of Freckle's case because it has been stated, confirmed, and heavily implied that she is both a lesbian and in love with Krista   Oh, not just her. It's downright highlighted in the official guide book that they're both attracted to each other. I dunno why - I thought it was obvious as day in the manga but I guess they wanted to make sure you get the point. Some people have been debating Kristas sexual orientation (you know, like it fcking matters), but I'm 1000% certain she's Ymirsexual."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,YumiruHisutoria,3,Tue Jul 21 02:55:07 2015 UTC,"Probably one of the most dumbest things one can do when in a debate about a character/ship is attempt to validate their argument by erasing and denying what is canon.

Ha, you could ask Ben if you can have some Ypopcorn!   With this, I was meaning in regards to the BY pairing. Of course it is a mutual attraction! Not only is it practically stated in the official guidebook and implied inside the manga, but all of the merch couples them (one in which both of their highest stats is their feelings for each other) and even the SmartPass AUs - which are supervised by Isa himself.   So, yeah.. They can keep debating until the titans attack, but there is no doubt that the goddess is in love with her freckled bae."

(I bring this up because I've seen that kind of argument a fuckton of times) On a personal level, I love this pairing because of the loyalty aspect and the complexity, and because I appreciate a good story. Whether others see it or not - meh. The smart ones will appreciate a good explanation and won't let it bother them at least."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,YumiruHisutoria,2,Tue Jul 21 10:55:39 2015 UTC,"Yeees! I personally like throwing logic and factual evidence at trolls to make them cringe and see if they can actually think of a half-decent reply.  Freckle's smirk is perfect for any case of trolling. It just completes the sarcastic edits.  The SmartPass AUs is a mobile app that is only available to those in Japan who pay about 300 yen a month. It features a limited amount of interviews and 'stories' of the characters. Although it is a canon material (because of Isayama monitoring and supervising it), not many people know about it due to copyright laws in Japan.   In one of the interviews, Tiny and Freckles must describe their perfect idea of a Significant Other. They pretty much described each other. In that same interview, Freckles says she would want someone who understands her. Tiny speaks up and says, ""I understand you!"" Again in the same interview, they agree that they would like to live together in a faraway place, just the two of them. In a separate story, it tells how they each get nightmares and whenever one does, the other embraces them and makes them feel better. It is flipping adorable.  My brothers are (I think) straight and even they see it. One ships it, the other acknowledges it as a canon ship. The only ones who do not see it are simply looking through straight shipper-goggles instead of paying attention to the heavily implied content. Personally, I also love this pairing, too, for these exact reasons. There is a great deal of emotionally deep and loving connections between these characters, and to add to it they are not portrayed stereo-typically/abnormal, in a sense, or sexualized."

Besides, if this was the case then why would such a statement like Manga Spoilers remain on the official website? And why would Manga Spoilers? Also, Manga Spoilers? I have already stated why I believe Freckles saved Bert.  Btw, I meant dude in a neutral way. I am a female who does not care for being called dude because I call everyone dude. I apologize if this offended you.  No, she is not a SJW. She is simply an avid reader and researcher of SnK. And no, I do not see how anything I said ""proves your point."" No one is trolling you, or even being hypocritical. I am not writing a load of anti-this and anti-that. I am stating facts that in no way harm you. I also stated that I do not understand the dynamics of your ship and that you are free to ship whatever. You are the troll who is harassing YH/YK shippers on YouTube, here, and most likely Tumblr, too.  Have a wonderful day."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,Yumiru,4,Mon Jul 20 19:49:09 2015 UTC,So fluid is her sexuality that she has only been shown to be interested in a girl and is even mentioned to not be interested in men. Fluid sexuality indeed.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,ShaggyA,5,Tue Jul 21 02:46:58 2015 UTC,"LOL, keep talking. You're amusing."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,YumiruHisutoria,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"wow, you must live in baltimore if this sort of entertainment amuses you."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,YumiruHisutoria,5,Mon Jul 20 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"And here I was, about to call you so you could stop this blasphemy.   Good to see you are already here dishing out justice!"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,HokageEzio,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:24:18 2015 UTC,so annoying people for a pairing you don't like is justice. and here I was feeling bad for spaming historia/ymir videos on utube with anti stuff and getting all my friends to do it.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,YumiruHisutoria,7,Mon Jul 20 18:34:11 2015 UTC,"No one is sending you hate for simply shipping something. Everyone is free to ship whatever they want.   You, on the other hand, are the one sending hate on YouTube for people shipping something you do not ship. People here are only calling you out on this nonsense. Ridiculous."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,Yumiru,-4,Mon Jul 20 19:21:57 2015 UTC,"really, cause why were the first couple of comments stupid hate comments. really, did the mean anti beruymi comments came first when I mentioned the youtube or before, and if you can post hate for beryumi, then I can post hate for yumikuri.  and mention where anyone discussed my comments on utube, go on, I will wait, :)"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,YumiruHisutoria,7,Mon Jul 20 19:26:46 2015 UTC,"Look Christina, really look. No one sent you some sudden ""I HATE THIS"" messages. No one called you names for shipping what you ship. It is how you act and your lack of reddiquette/Internet etiquette that is what is driving everyone mad.  People were calling you out based on your comment history here. You were the one who proved it correct by admitting to sending hate to YH/YK shippers on YouTube.  But aside from this, why would you use such primitive logic? ""They did dat do I did dat durr!1!1!!111!"" Seriously. If you were as mature as you try to pretend you are, why do something so needless and petty?"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,ShaggyA,6,Mon Jul 20 19:35:15 2015 UTC,Stop trying to use logic.  Just do my approach.  Out troll them.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,dan105,7,Mon Jul 20 19:37:30 2015 UTC,I just enjoy using logic because the 'big words' confuses them and they are forced to find some other way to argue.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,BenChandler,3,Mon Jul 20 19:52:06 2015 UTC,Logic doesn't work with people like them.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,dan105,5,Mon Jul 20 19:41:56 2015 UTC,"I know, but at least it confuses such fail-trolls."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,BenChandler,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:27 2015 UTC,My comment was more ment as a joke towards Benchandler and his punctuality on posts that has anything to do with his freckled goddess.   So I apologise if it came out the wrong way. :)
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,OmegaRipper501,3,Mon Jul 20 19:42:38 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the person you've tagged is banned, and this new account is a troll account?"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,BenChandler,4,Mon Jul 20 17:21:17 2015 UTC,"I'd think that the person was banned given that they showed up on the sub a few months later with a different account spewing the exact same crap. I'd be very, very surprised if this isn't the same person."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,BenChandler,2,Mon Jul 20 17:36:11 2015 UTC,"Creating a new account to circumvent a ban could get the person banned from reddit overall. Not sure how strictly it's enforced, but I don't intend to find out."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,DarthMewtwo,-5,Mon Jul 20 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"ok. so what did i do to warrant a ban? explain it. because I see the word troll being thrown around and unless there is an explicit ban on ymir/bertholdt, it is as valid as any ship. or all rediters just childish bullies."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,CogChoir,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:41:54 2015 UTC,"yes, but yaoi fangirls started it. so when males are not made gay for no reason despite an expressed interest in girls. cough jean cough. I will be happy to let ymir be in the state she was written. :)"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,MrJefferson2001,5,Mon Jul 20 18:46:20 2015 UTC,"Some yaoi fangirls who scream canon without evidence can be annoying too but hey, most of them don't imply their pairings are canon or there are feelings. Just like you do, implying Ymir loves a dude whom she barely interacted with and instead has a whole development with Historia and also has an official pic that says she's in love with her. Not to mention the whole manga already points to that. Same for Historia, whom barely interacted with Reiner and only was on Ymir's side.  You are doing the exact same thing those ""yaoi fanglirs"" you speak of, are doing. And i can't believe i'm talking to you. Your posts show exactly why i shouldn't take you seriously.  Have fun calling people delusional and ""sjw"" :) But don't be mad if you get banned."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,Yumiru,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"so if I show you accounts where they showed manga evidence as support for their canon, you will do what? shut down your reddit account. :P) Barely interacted, she save his life and spent time together off screen. :) an official pic that can be taken as sisters being together. I have seen historia/Eren pics and entire posts of the recent chapter of the manga, not taking that as proof though..the pairing is cute. Ymir knows her, so sisters before misters. :)  really, you mean how you dislike gays being seen as straight but support an official shippiing guide with heteros turned into gays? :) for what? they ban you for that...are the moderators on crack? I thought reddit was about free speech, not abuse of power. :) but hey, guess I can just call all of you hypocrites then. :)"

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,asianedy,5,Mon Jul 20 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"And I think you need to learn the word ""delusional"" and SJW. And apparently you have no idea what these 2 mean. You think Ymir is intersted in someone other than Historia and Historia interested in Reiner.   Either you're a big troll or didn't read the manga."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,Yumiru,3,Mon Jul 20 18:40:08 2015 UTC,"Hi, I think I'm your ""sjw friend"" who provided the link to the very, very bad shipping guide in the sidebar (in case you were wondering). It's a pleasure."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,Yumiru,-5,Mon Jul 20 19:25:20 2015 UTC,"I know both those terms. no, i think there is possiblity for Ymir to like someone other than Historia since she left the former for Bertholdt, like Jean/Marco is pretty popular despite his interest in Mikasa. and Historia did show kindness to Reiner.  You are SJW, because here you are calling me a troll because I straightened a gay, but you would never say anything or treat someone like this who preferred yaoi like eren/levi. and even the shipping guide your sjw friend referred had yaoi pairing when neither of the males were expressively gay. so tell me why you are not a sjw hypocrite and a bigger troll?"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,HokageEzio,7,Mon Jul 20 18:53:03 2015 UTC,"Ymir Leaving Historia for Bert, for romantic reasons   Yep, you clearly didn't read the manga.    implying i have no problem with ereri.   But hey at least with Eren and Levi, there's nothing that shows interest in same sex or opposite sex. Ymir has only shown interest in a girl. Jean in a girl too. Yet you whine about Jean but you're fine with erasing Ymir. :)   kindness=/=romantic love   She took care of him. That's all. Such love wow.  You go around and call shippers delusional for saying Ymir is gay and that Historia only showed strong interest in Ymir, then you get mad i call you a troll? Bruh..... the brains, they burn."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dxydx,HokageEzio,-4,Mon Jul 20 19:07:58 2015 UTC,"No, it will develop into romance.  haha. no sweetie, pretty sure levi showed interest in petra or did you not watch the anime. :) Ymir has so far expressed interest in a girl, but she could change. :) and I am not whining about Jean, you are whining about Ymir but erasing Jean, Levi, Armin, Marco, Erwin and any male with a good bod for disease spreading gay sex.  yes, like ymir took care of historia, and became her friend, and given the chance, Riener would have taken care of Krista. :) no, i am calling them delusional for saying Ymir is only gay and can't be biromantic, bicurious or polyamorous. :) Historia showed a strong interest in protecting her friend. yes, because you have no reason to call me to a troll but I can call you a hypocritical SJW keyboard warrior.  and it is fiction, I can think whatever I want. your stupidity is so terrible, donkeys want their tiny brains back from you."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,supermilne,4,Mon Jul 20 01:01:31 2015 UTC,"Is it even out? I mean I know Funimation somehow struck a deal with Toho to show it at some VERY SPECIFIC location in the US first and then in Japan. I haven't seen it yet but I'm still pretty excited for it.   It could be bad, it could be okay, it could be great. Who knows.  The negativity around here for the movie has REALLY been getting on my nerves. Past few months have been bashing upon bashing for something most of us haven't even seen yet (Though that's likely to change soon)  We knew from the start that it was a more modern, post apocalyptic Japan that is loosely based on Attack on Titan. So why people are suddenly surprised that it's exactly as it was advertised is beyond me.  It's not a hollywood movie with a $800 million budget so of course it's not going to look fantastic. As it stands it looks okay, is it great? No. Is it amazing? No. It's Alright albeit a little cheesy but that's to be expected.  And that's all I can really ask for considering most Anime adaptations have just been outright horrible (Avatar, Dragonball, Sailor Moon)  This one looks pretty decent and fun from what I've seen. It's just the internet so of course everyone has a stick up their ass about it and hates it without it being fully out yet (Again likely to change soon)  If you see it and dislike it? Fine but at least see it first before you complain about it.   Hell I've seen people bitch about it just because it had Mikasa kissing Levi like who the fuck cares? We know it's a different storyline so why should it matter?   People are so eager to throw it under the bus acting like it has NO redeeming quality too it."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,Sohtak,7,Mon Jul 20 02:45:41 2015 UTC,"wait, Mikasa kissed Levi? Aren't they related in some way?"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,YamadaDesigns,5,Mon Jul 20 03:28:13 2015 UTC,The movie barely follows the source material at all. They have the same setting and some of the same characters but that's where the similarities end.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,IrrelevantLeprechaun,7,Mon Jul 20 05:16:02 2015 UTC,There is no Mikasa in the movie. Kiko's character is called 'Mikasa' but she's anything but her. It's like calling an apple a banana... You know it's not a banana..but the producers want you to believe it is one. Don't let a name betray your brain.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,ErenNoWaifu,2,Mon Jul 20 12:47:24 2015 UTC,"well, it seems like the producers are missing out on what people like about the Attack on Titan series then."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,YamadaDesigns,2,Mon Jul 20 14:41:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is Levi, but a new character introduced in this movie.   Edit: I think his name is Shikishima"

I just figured, since most of the names are european names and almost all look european, that it would take place in Europe or in the US. It just gets on my nerves when people slam the US for adapting things and white-washing them, and then Japan does the opposite for this (and yes I realise that it's originally Japanese, but still)"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,Zaeh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:29:48 2015 UTC,"The characters aren't specifically European, and there's actually no proof for the series to be even set on earth, but the allusions are pretty clear with the names and everyone being white - which makes the live action film's characters feel very out of place."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,ErenNoWaifu,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but do you have any idea why people slam Hollywood for whitewashing characters? Do you really think it's only because the ethnicity of their favorite cartoon character was changed in the live action version?"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,reigun91,3,Mon Jul 20 12:50:33 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there are more, more complex reasons. But that's one of the ones that I'm hearing time and time again"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,busboy123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:17 2015 UTC,Sailor Moon had a live-action adaptation?
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,ErenNoWaifu,2,Mon Jul 20 07:09:43 2015 UTC,"The problem is that other than the most basic premises, it shares nothing with the original series. While I agree it would be impossible to follow the manga, the script for the movie sounds like it was a bad fanfiction. Of all the things to mess up, that's the least understandable. Special effects, props, those would make sense as they don't have the resources. But a script? I would rather have even worse effects and devote more money to getting better fucking writers than the shit they created."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,H-K_47,3,Tue Jul 21 00:15:18 2015 UTC,"I think people are ignoring one very important point : The movie was planned way before the anime even went into the production stage. Yes it did get shelved because of a lack of sufficient funds. But after the anime aired and became a big hit, the producers decided they could take a risk on the live action project. It was never meant to be a faithful adaptation in the first place. What attracted them was the concept not the plot or the characters. I wouldn't call the movie an adaptation of the anime because it was never meant to be one. So, all these accusations of fans that they are riding on its popularity are bullshit."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,ErenNoWaifu,3,Mon Jul 20 12:39:15 2015 UTC,That sounds really interesting! Do you have a source on that?
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,MitchA256,2,Mon Jul 20 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. I have consumed so much Aot related content online that it was very difficult for me to remember exactly where I had read about the Live action films. There was this particular blog where I think I had read about it. But it's been taken down and the twitter handle has been deleted as well =( Another source where I think I had read about it was Rocketnews24 but they keep posting tonnes of Aot articles every month, so I might have to dig them up and let u know later, in case I find it. But yes. There is this site that used to translate articles from the japanese net. It's been inactive for 2 years but luckily the older articles are still up. Here you go: bit.ly/18hlxvr Note the sentence : 'Fans of the series have been steadily increasing, as more people are following this news closely than it was FIRST announced TWO YEARS AGO' The date of this post is 9 Dec 2013...which means the movie was first announced in 2011. The anime was announced in late Dec 2012, aired from April 2013. It's not very explicit. You have to kinda 'read between the lines'"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,YamadaDesigns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:58:50 2015 UTC,"Well that changes things! I certainly didn't know that (apparently not many other people did too). I'm still peeved that they'd have such diversity in the anime, and then not in the film though"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,IrrelevantLeprechaun,3,Mon Jul 20 20:32:20 2015 UTC,I just finished the series 2 days ago. Not even an anime fan per say. But I grew attached to Levi and the real Eren. The fact that they changed their personalities really will degrade the franchise. Levi was one of the most captivating characters in the entire series.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,YamadaDesigns,3,Mon Jul 20 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"If there's someone disappointing about manga turned into live-action movies in Japan, it's that their actors are not able to look like the characters in the slightest, but I guess it can't be helped since most countries don't have the sort of ethnic diversity that America does."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,Zaeh,3,Mon Jul 20 03:27:31 2015 UTC,I don't know why they thought it was okay to make it with an all Japanese cast considering it's a very important plot element that Mikasa is one of the only Asians in the population.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,YamadaDesigns,8,Mon Jul 20 05:16:57 2015 UTC,"Imagine the scene when the sex traffickers capture Mikasa and kill her parents. ""She's one of the last Asians!"" ""Um, yeah...we're.....European? Scottish people have straight black hair and eye color right?"""
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,Zaeh,2,Mon Jul 20 05:43:49 2015 UTC,"Mikasa being specifically half-Asian and the majority bloodline being specifically white is not significant at all, the only important thing is that Mikasa is half that rare ethnicity.  The live action adaptation could've easily reversed the plot point with Asians being the majority bloodline and white people being the rare ones, but it seems that not even remotely that much thought went into the film."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,YamadaDesigns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:19 2015 UTC,Did they say what happened to all the Asians? I really don't understand the history of the Titan epidemic at all.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,AnalSlutFrog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"Well, the live action film and the original series have it completely differently to begin with. But in the original series, it's just mentioned that they were mostly wiped out, either due to the seemingly perpetual war that humankind was at, or due to just generally having bad luck when the titans appeared. Or a third one which would require spoiler tags, which I never seem to get to work on mobile."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dw5dh,Stiller3,4,Tue Jul 21 17:40:42 2015 UTC,Because finding German actors fluent in Japanese would be a fucking nightmare? You have to make certain concessions when adapting source material to film sometimes.   If it's a Japanese production of course they're going to use mostly Japanese actors. What other choice did they have really? Partnering with Hollywood is the only thing that would've enabled a faithful adaptation but then you're dealing with American Producers and Studio Heads concerned with the mainstream appeal of a Japanese IP.  There's a good chance it'd be even worse than what's been released because of industry politics and bullshit.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dtwst,shibiscuit,11,Sun Jul 19 12:42:18 2015 UTC,"The plot doesn't deviate much, the training arc is actually flashbacks and the final battle is almost completely different. The main difference is actually subtle changes that undermines characters and their relationships. For example, Eren and Annie had a strong bond during training since they would spar with each other and she would teach Eren her hand to hand fighting skill. Things like that and subtle changes change the way you potentially see a character.   Here a slightly spoilerish image from episode 15 I believe showing how much the subtle changes change the characters.   http://media.tumblr.com/027ea34cb19260d6730dadc463b7c6bf/tumblr_inline_mqogogujlw1qz4rgp.jpg  Plus, anime Eren isn't as likeable as manga Eren.  TL;DR Plot is almost the same, characters are different, Hanji is best grill."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dtwst,Katsup-doo-doo31,5,Sun Jul 19 19:17:11 2015 UTC,"I don't find anime!Eren any less likeable than manga!Eren. He just didn't have as much character development because the anime didn't get to that point yet.   Honestly, having seen the anime first, I didn't find many differences in the way the characters were portrayed. The only thing that sticks out for me is the omission of the Eren/Annie bond, which I agree is not good for Annie's character (but now it's animated in the compilation movie, so it's all good). But the rest? I have no issues. When I read the manga, my opinions of the characters that were formed by the anime didn't change at all (except for Annie). Most of the changes made in the anime, I felt, were consistent with the characters' core personalities and the themes expressed in the manga. And I really loved some extra scenes that fleshed out the characters more and made them more relatable (like the entire episode 2 dealing with Eren's PTSD or the Eren/Mikasa scene in episode 25 where he confessed it felt good being lost inside the Titan, which is a nice bit of foreshadowing for his current mental state).  Edit: missed a word."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dtwst,Tanya30,3,Sun Jul 19 21:17:35 2015 UTC,"They have the same core, sure but the changes can give a new fan a different impression of him since they don't have all the character development the manga has. For example, on the night of graduation, anime Eren makes a big speech about his beliefs after Thomas told him joining the scouts was crazy, then he starts to cry, runs outside and has Armin and Mikasa follow him while Jean mutters to himself. In the manga and compilation film, Eren still makes a big speech about his beliefs since Jean insults him them, gets in a fist fight with Jean then has Mikas drag him out kicking and screaming. Both seem childish, but at least manga Eren is established as a man of action, someone who will fight for his beliefs witch imho is more likeable. The plot has the same result, but Eren's character suffers for it. Some extra scenes like the ones you mentioned are great, but the omission of stuff like that, or the Eren/Annie bond makes him subtly less likeable.   Plus, I would argue that the anime betrays the themes expressed in the manga in the final episodes but that's another discussion entirely."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,BenChandler,5,Fri Jul 17 16:15:11 2015 UTC,Very interesting. Though I believe that Ymir's backstory might be similar to  the god Ymir.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Armchar,8,Fri Jul 17 21:31:55 2015 UTC,"This theory doesn't feel that crack to me, either. But Isayama hasn't revealed too much about Ymir yet, so he's got plenty of room to throw some surprises at us.  My personal interpretation of what Ymir meant by the ""we're alike"" comment is that Ymir relates to being unwanted because of something over which she has no control (because it's part of her existence) and wanting to please people to win their love. I didn't think that Ymir is also a bastard. I just thought that she was born with some special ability that can be both a blessing and a curse. It would be cool if that special ability is what you've suggested, especially if it ties in with her name."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,magot-pie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:42:12 2015 UTC,"The main reason I think she is a bastard is because of her comment about being hated for simply existing. Combine that with the ""we're alike"" comment and how a titan showed respect to (who it thought was) her, and it looks like her situation was very similar to Historia's.  She had family problems at the very least."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,taksark,6,Fri Jul 17 23:08:29 2015 UTC,"Nice theory.   I was thinking that ""Ymir"" could be more of a title than a name. Maybe the original ruling family of where she was originally from is called Ymir."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,AnyaGlass,3,Fri Jul 17 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"I sort of always wondered if shifting could be have been genetic for some groups of people, because there has to be another way to become a shifter besides eating one or else their whole existence wouldn't make any sense. So there has to at least be a serum that can turn a person directly into a shifter.  I feel it would be redundant if Ymir too was a bastard, I think it's more likely that maybe her mother died during childbirth and her family hated her for that? Or both of her parents died when she was young and this could have caused a feud within the family over who should rule until she came of age, while in reality they were trying to take her throne?   I definitely don't think your theory is crack. It seems pretty sane to me, but yet then I've read theories about Armin being the smiling titan and Grisha having an identical twin."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Valen_the_Dovahkiin,3,Sat Jul 18 01:08:38 2015 UTC,"I'm down with Ymir having some sort of special significance in some society outside the walls, but I feel that making her some kind of royalty just doesn't mesh all that well with the character. She's too uncouth and snarky for that background to be all that credible IMO.  I feel like ""Mad Scientist's Rude Daughter"" would be an interesting route to take with her. Because seriously, who else would name their daughter Ymir?"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Zuko95,3,Sat Jul 18 05:02:09 2015 UTC,"""Ymir-sama"" and ""Ymir's people"" doesn't really point to any other possibility besides royalty (or something very similar to it)."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Valen_the_Dovahkiin,3,Sat Jul 18 05:10:14 2015 UTC,"the honorific sama doesn't imply royalty, it's just shows great respect."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Yumiru,3,Sat Jul 18 06:16:22 2015 UTC,"It's not just the honorific though. It's that combined with the ""Ymir's people"" comment. The honorific alone wouldn't mean much but the ""Ymir's people"" stuff together with the honorific points to her being in a position of power or being related to someone in a position of power."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Jeantron,4,Sat Jul 18 06:23:27 2015 UTC,"You can be a leader of human beings without being royalty or any sort of landed aristocracy. Plus, we don't know exactly what was up with the Titan from OVA 1. ""Ymir-sama"" is a honorific of respect and deference that does not necessarily connote royalty and ""Ymir's people"" could mean lots of different things: people Ymir ruled over, a group of people she was a part of, or even just a reference to Titans themselves. It's totally conceivable that she is royalty, but I have to say if that is the case, I don't really like the direction it would take her character."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Katsup-doo-doo31,2,Sat Jul 18 05:58:39 2015 UTC,"I guess she doesn't necessarily have to be royalty for these to happen. But being referred to as sama, being bowed to, and the ""Ymir's people"" comment to me at the very least points to her being someone in a position of power or being related to someone in a position of power outside the wall."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Jeantron,3,Sat Jul 18 06:27:14 2015 UTC,"Plus the ""maybe we're alike"" she said to Historia, who is a royalty and the last of her family. She and Historia probably have a lot of similarities.  Edit: that's probably one of the reasons why she went to find her after hearing those cultists."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,defend435,7,Sat Jul 18 12:03:06 2015 UTC,"Ben-chan, you know I can't read all of that. I'll just assume it says ""Ymir is awesome"" and leave it at that. :D  inb4 downvotes"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Ubernicken,2,Fri Jul 17 19:39:27 2015 UTC,"It's more ""Ymir's childhood was shit"" but there is a bit of ""Ymir is awesome"" in there I guess.  No need to worry about down votes, I seem to be attracting them all right now. :/"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Ubernicken,4,Sat Jul 18 02:32:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I just don't want any more special bloodline stuff, that's way to overused imho. But it does seem plausible, I'm still really curious to what her hometown is like. We already know people live lives outside the walls, and I'm mostly interested in their cultures and goals."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,real95,6,Fri Jul 17 18:35:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not too big on the bloodline stuff either. But with the way things are going and the lack of other explanations, shifting being a bloodline power is starting to look like the most likely answer to the origins of shifters.  I would think that Ymir's people would either be behind a wall or on an Island somewhere. Ymir knows what herring is so an Island group or a walled community on the coast seems the most likely. So I would imagine they would be somewhat similar to those kinds of groups."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Nymphonerd,4,Fri Jul 17 18:44:12 2015 UTC,"Iceland, maybe? Lots of herring and goat head is extremely ICEolated from the rest of the world. Also, younger brother of Norway."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Yumiru,3,Fri Jul 17 19:41:18 2015 UTC,Are you on tumblr cause this sound like a theory i read from a blog? Not a bad theory. But really more bloodline powers?
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Nymphonerd,2,Fri Jul 17 20:45:22 2015 UTC,Yes and yes.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Yumiru,5,Fri Jul 17 23:01:38 2015 UTC,"Good theory but why do people keep speculating that Ymir's similarity with Historian is due to them being illegitimate children?   From what I see, Historia was a 'mistake' that had the potential to undermine the status quo of the ruling powers within the walls - which was pretty much what happened - and this was the reason to her being hated.  I feel that this is more likely the similarity they share. So from there, it seems probable that Ymir was probably one with a different ideology from the ruling powers in her society or that there are some point/s of difference that actually results in her being a threat to the status quo because for me being hated to hell just for being an illegitimate child, while possible, feels a tad bit shallow for SnK's storyline."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,pwnagekitten,2,Fri Jul 17 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"""Hated for simply existing.""  Combine that with her saying that she and Historia are alike and the titan showing respect to her look-a-like despite her saying she was hated, and I don't really see any other possibilities.   Hated for simply existing is odd wording for someone who was hated for having a different ideology or something like that. Plus she was only 12 or 13 at the most when she became a mindless titan.   Edit: Down Vote Brigade! Tell me, what are your opinions on my theory?"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,Yumiru,2,Sat Jul 18 00:35:19 2015 UTC,"I guess it boils down to 'who' hates her for 'simply existing'.   Even now, though many have accepted to accept Historia as the new (and rightful) Queen, it is likely that many members of the aristocracy, especially those with significant ruling power hate her for her existence as her emergence has changed the status quo - what then was their almost exclusive power over the masses through a puppet King, is now almost absent. Even more so when the masses are actually accepting her as their new ruler.  Whatever the case is, we still don't know for sure what that point of similarity is and it's still just speculation."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,pwnagekitten,2,Sat Jul 18 05:58:18 2015 UTC,Can you share where you see the book with Ymir in It?

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,pwnagekitten,3,Sat Jul 18 01:14:31 2015 UTC,it could be the unoffical versions that I've read so please correct me if I'm wrong but i don't actually remember Ymir confirming that she got the shifter ability from RBAs friend i just remember her confirming that she ate him. what if and this is a very big what if. she was already a shifter before she ate RBAs friend and she was just working for a different faction of shifters so she ate him because he was an enemy. i think that would make this theory a little more plausible not that it isn't good on it's on. like i said i may not have gotten a well translated source so this could be completely off but food for thought if I'm not off.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dmzhm,pwnagekitten,3,Fri Jul 17 21:19:57 2015 UTC,she was just working for a different faction of shifters so she ate him because he was an enemy   She was mindless. She didn't know who she ate and she did told RB that if it weren't for them she'd be forever in eternal nightmare as mindless titan.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,daviatella,70,Thu Jul 16 22:25:49 2015 UTC,"Man, judging by the translations of the plot, it seems like Isayama just let them do whatever they want. It sounded like it was a bad fanfiction by Mikasa."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,asianedy,24,Thu Jul 16 23:57:08 2015 UTC,"He did - from the press conference for the film, Isayama apparently himself told TOHO to not mind the setting for the manga at all, as long as they made something ""interesting” and only “live action” could do. Isayama was still “very much involved in the creative process,"" though."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,mika6000,28,Fri Jul 17 01:08:01 2015 UTC,"But the plot just sounds... bad. I know that the movie would've had almost a completely different premise, but the extra drama inserted just ruin it."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,Fixer_,17,Fri Jul 17 03:51:28 2015 UTC,"Gonna copy it from /a/  Movie spoilers from yesterday.  In a post-apocalyptic future where only a fraction of humanity has survived to live humbly amongst the rubble, Eren Jaeger dreams of more. His brainy friend Armin tells tall tales about deserts and oceans beyond the massive walls that guard their civilization, and his girlfriend Mikasa is equally entranced by the birds that soar over those untouchable barricades. Unfortunately, Eren's wish to see the walls opened to the outside world comes at a devastating cost. Enormous humanoid monsters called ""Titans"" come stampeding through the walls and immediately start eating every man, woman, and child they can find.  In the aftermath of the tragedy, Eren joins the newly minted ""Titan Survey Corps"" alongside hundreds of other young adults. Some of these new soldiers are hungry for revenge, but most are just plain hungry due to the ensuing famine. While facing down his demons and fighting through past trauma, Eren will have to rediscover what ""freedom"" means to him in a new world ruled by fear. Eren and Mikasa were dating before the first attack Mikasa gets separated from Eren and Armin and is presumed dead It's implied that Shikishima saved Mikasa's life During Eren and Mikasa's reunion Mikasa is butthurt towards Eren since she thinks that he abandoned her after the first attack It becomes evident that Shikishima holds romantic feelings for Mikasa Armin and Sasha seem to have a thing going on Eren and Mikasa's relationship starts out as cold after their reunion but Mikasa slowly starts warming up to him At the end of the movie Eren gets eaten and he shifts, Mikasa is the one who pulls him out of his titan form and she hugs him tightly.  The first part removes all mystery about the world, and the second just add cheap drama. And I don't really think I need to mention shipping cancer."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,asianedy,26,Fri Jul 17 03:54:54 2015 UTC,Wow.  I don't really like the fact that Mikasa and Eren are dating.  Thanks for the reply.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,Fixer_,15,Fri Jul 17 04:07:45 2015 UTC,"Yep, they completely change their relationship from siblings to this. And there are even worse things that Eren apparently does..."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,asianedy,2,Fri Jul 17 04:13:29 2015 UTC,So is Armin thrown under the bus in favor of this lovey dovey thing?
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,da_drifter0912,10,Sat Jul 18 03:12:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that doesn't sound like a bad idea. SnK's story was designed with the pace of a manga in mind, and while that can translate into an anime without too many problems, that sort of structure doesn't necessarily fit a movie.  Whether it'll turn out good is a different matter entirely, but I personally think it was a good call. Let it live or die on its own merits."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,DirkDasterLurkMaster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:41:35 2015 UTC,"Following the anime timeline, they could fit most of everything up until the end of Trost into a live action without it seeming awkward"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,luigitheplumber,3,Fri Jul 17 18:18:17 2015 UTC,The recap movie did that and they still had to cut down quite a bit.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,DirkDasterLurkMaster,2,Fri Jul 17 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"Not every scene needs to be present. Half hour intro for the breach of Maria, 40 minutes for them joining the military and training, then about an hour for all of Trost.  They wouldn't be able to linger on the details as much but it would still make an acceptable adaptation IMO"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,luigitheplumber,2,Fri Jul 17 18:35:55 2015 UTC,"No, I completely get that. That's basically what I was saying earlier, it just comes down to what you think that will do to the pacing. While many people agree the boulder build-up was in dire need of some speeding up, the first eight-ish episodes worked really well. What happens when you try to turn 13 episodes (just over 4 hours) into a 2 hour movie is that the pacing has to be turned up to 11 as you try to keep up with the same story beats while skimping on details.   What happens then is that people inevitably compare the movie to the anime, and it just can't hold up because it tries to do the same thing with drastically less complexity (see Evangelion's Rebuild movies, or at least the first two). That's why I think adaptations (like the live action one, not recaps) should just try to do their own thing."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,DirkDasterLurkMaster,2,Fri Jul 17 19:41:47 2015 UTC,"Haha I'm actually finishing up Evangelion now and I'm gonna move on to the rebuilds whenever I can get them. I'll have a better idea.  My compromise would be to wait until more of the story is revealed and then keep most of the important stuff while cutting some less vital characters, like Connie for example, find which characters to focus on to prevent awkward pacing.  You're right that at the end it would be different, but I don't mind as long as the setting, ambience and main characters are the same"

I mean look at Game of Thrones, despite their viewership the CGI still looks like crap occasionally.   Its one thing to draw manga, another to produce a feature film that requires this crazy amount of CGI. I mean, AOT is not exactly a chic flick with some green screens here or there. Think of the titans, the wall, the battles, the 3DMG, the death and destruction. Who would invest that much money and expect returns from a little know series, let alone a manga.   So, from a business point of view, producing an avenger quality movie is perhaps far from smart. So I understand the shortcuts the movie makers had to make and why the movie looks bad."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,negee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:53:36 2015 UTC,"Dude, Game of Thrones is a TV series. Movies have way better effects and it's been that way for a while. 3DMG-like spiderman came out a decade ago, Titans won't be hard to animate either. The wall should be a piece of cake for a good studio."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,luigitheplumber,23,Sat Jul 18 14:46:29 2015 UTC,I feel the same way =(

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,pyarsa1,4,Fri Jul 17 16:44:50 2015 UTC,"Everything that isn't a person looks larger than life in a way that looks cartoony, especially the titans, the titans don't look real at all. They do look kind of cool, and they look a very well done, but they don't look real. Also I would love to see sprawling landscapes with lots of space, but everything in this trailer looks so compact."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,Kate925,7,Fri Jul 17 06:10:09 2015 UTC,"From what I see, it seems they put the entire budget into animating the Colossal (which I don't like, he's too sinew-y and big) and normal titans.  Everything else, like the stunts for the 3DMG scenes, Eren's titan, the town/walls and the Survey Corps uniforms (they both look scruffy as hell)...got a measly budget which is why they look crap."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,VeggieFiend,2,Fri Jul 17 11:31:01 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why I think too! The Colossal is ""the face"" of the show, so it was a marketing move"

Edit: this is the biggest problem with japanese adaptations, the directors want to prove themselves as people who can do good movies, so they just use the source material as an excuse, and they do whatever the fuck they want. I mean, this was in a review:   ""It takes place in the future of our world, with remnants of warplanes and weaponry peppered across the countryside. Its great walls were built by human hands, and even though they live in repurposed ruins, the people seem very happy""   and Mikasa's pseudosexual relationship with the captain is a huge wtf because she's pretty much the most interesting character in the manga. I mean, they actually changed the most symbolic character and the most important part (the walls built by humans)"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,ManateeofSteel,6,Fri Jul 17 02:41:04 2015 UTC,"I still like the Mikasa fanfiction metaphor a little better, but yeah."

Mikasa is the only Asian so they won't have to get a full Asian cast. Looking back on Jurassic World, Pacific Rim, and Godzilla although the movies were questionable, the giant monsters were amazing.  Unfortunately that will never happen. Waaaayy too much money, it'd be rated R (probably pg 13), Not an American property therefore less known, and in all honesty Hollywood would fuck with it too much."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,ClickingGeek,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:56:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with this statement. Having a more diverse cast in this case could definitely benefit the film. I would even cast an Asian as Eren. I just don't see why the Japanese don't hire an American visual effects team. Look at Avengers, look at even Transformers, the CGI is insane.   Although the CGI is a lot better than say, Power Rangers CGI, it still gives off the vibe of being like a Sy-fy film. Ugh."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,nocheslas,23,Fri Jul 17 20:35:19 2015 UTC,Hopefully there's a Hollywood version once the manga is finished.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,KDL2000,30,Fri Jul 17 01:17:46 2015 UTC,"I know people will downvote you for this. But I actually agree. First and foremost, most of the cast is supposed to be european except Mikasa, since everyone seems to be so obsessed with ""matching the original nationalities"".  Hollywood likes to add their famous actors here and there, but most of the time, they are pretty accurate adaptations. They might be obsessed with giving one-liners, but I'd rather have that than whatever the fuck they're doing with it here. I appreciate they tried to make it horror and not action, but c'mon. I mean, Edge of Tomorrow is a Hollywood-esque manga/LN adaptation that turned out really good. I don't know why some people refuse to believe in Hollywood"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,ManateeofSteel,6,Fri Jul 17 02:50:16 2015 UTC,"I dunno. It seems like for every good Hollywood adaption, there are five awful ones. For every Edge of Tomorrow, there's a Dragonball Evolution.  No matter great the source material might be, you're taking a risk when you sell it to Hollywood. Hollywood producers just don't seem to get things that don't fit into typical genre styles.  Weighing the possibilities, I really don't think Hollywood would make a very good Attack on Titan movie."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,NickNack4EvahBra,8,Fri Jul 17 03:19:26 2015 UTC,"but on that mentality, it has more misses with japanese adaptations than hits"

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,ManateeofSteel,2,Fri Jul 17 03:35:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but even better, why didn't they get some cosplayers to act and lip sync and then lay over Japanese voices in post?"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,gymnasticRug,0,Fri Jul 17 06:16:58 2015 UTC,When I said Hollywood I didn't mean a Marvel action kind of movie. It could be filmed in Australia for all I care. This Live Action movie is just really cringy imo. I doubt there will be another AoT movie filmed in Japan.

Maybe if they had released this one earlier I wouldn't have been so quick to say it would be laughably bad. With the so far positive praise and now this trailer, I kind of have hope that this will be decent.  Seeing a living, breathing, version of the smiling titan will now creep me out for days. At least if this movie is terrible they did get something right."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,ViperJoe,16,Fri Jul 17 07:24:31 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's Shikishima and Mikasa."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,mika6000,8,Fri Jul 17 00:55:42 2015 UTC,"From what i understand, Shikishima is NOT Levi...He has his skill, but not his personality, and is perhaps even a somewhat reprehensible character; Mikasa is implied to be his sexual subordinate in a way that suggests he controls her, despite being pretty much mentally and physically scarred. I may be wrong of course, having not seen the film."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,alooulla,14,Fri Jul 17 01:08:28 2015 UTC,"Mikasa is implied to be his sexual subordinate in a way that suggests he controls her   Oh, fuck me -_-"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,ViperJoe,3,Fri Jul 17 01:22:11 2015 UTC,"Only implied, and maybe its more psychologically sexual than physically so. I honestly am not familiar with this trope of Japanese horror cinema so i cannot say for definite what its like. Some are saying she's just really submissive and meek to him, but apparently its quite common in Japanese cinema for 'vulnerable' girls to act this way."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,alooulla,4,Fri Jul 17 03:08:58 2015 UTC,"That'd be just as bad, if not even worse. I'll never understand why Japan tends to glorify sexual abuse; sometimes I seriously fear that I'll become desensitized to it as a result of my (indirect) exposure to Japanese culture."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,ViperJoe,4,Fri Jul 17 03:17:03 2015 UTC,"They are both as bad as each other to me. But from all reports I have read, the not-Levi is an asshole, and isn't played sympathetically, so at least there is that. All the same, I would rather it not be a thing."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,alooulla,5,Fri Jul 17 02:18:27 2015 UTC,"That's...that's exactly what I love about SnK, among many other things. I love how the female character are--I hate to sound preachy but so many anime and movies have these ""tragic"" hopeless female characters; I like that the female characters in AOT are hardly ""female"" characters, but just awesome characters in their own, just like everyone else. It's hard to see gender in Snk, for me at least. Guess that didn't translate to the film...  Thanks for letting me know though. I know absolutely nothing about the movie except for the stuff in the trailers--how everyone is asian, how some dude replaced Levi, and apparently, how Mikasa may turn out to be a whiny bitch!"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,FantasticHamburguesa,2,Fri Jul 17 02:22:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel you. I feel exactly the same, and It makes me deeply uncomfortable about seeing this movie. I may end up doing so just for  Hange, who is apparently really good."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dk3je,ClickingGeek,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:32:37 2015 UTC,"Last trailer I did a little analysis of the trailer for things I noticed, there isn't much new stuff in this trailer, other than confirmation that Titan Eren is in it really. In the scene where Eren, Armin(?), Mikasa and Hannes(?) are backing away from the wall just before colossal titan shows his face it looks like theres almost like a castle tower in the background. Likewise the animated of scene immediately after it looks like (Yharnam) the titans are in a rather middle ages styled area, and doesn't match up with the technology shown in the movie, but then the rest of the shots show more modern buildings. Maybe the titans have been around for centuries and killed a ton of people way back before they were forced to build the walls? Probably overthinking this, but still. It's fun to theorycraft.   I'm really disappointed that the titans look worse in this trailer than they did in that car commercial (Although I think colossal titan looks amazing). Most of the reason I wanted to see the movie in the first place was because the titans in that commercial looked so good, I wanted to see it in a full movie.   Military uniforms look great though."

Fuck all the negativity. That's why I hate the internet people just needlessly bitch before actually seeing it in person. Am I saying it's perfect? No. Did I say it was amazing? No  I said it looks okay and looks pretty much as I expected it too. I'm still going to go see it and not allow the negativity circlejerk to impede my enjoyment of the movie :)

Isayama was “very much involved in the creative process.” There were no stuntmen in the film - all the actors did their own action scenes. They originally hired a stuntman for Miura Haruma but had to fire him because the actor was actually better. For 3DMG movements, they referenced the anime portrayals a lot, but there were limits to what a human being could do. Turning was the hardest part. The actors went to see the original Godzilla (Which happened to be in theaters at the time) to help with their imaginations while filming."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3decbw,Purdy14,2,Wed Jul 15 22:44:16 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard the start of the movie is very good and the titans are very well done and terrifying. The biggest problems is that none of the characters are anything like their originals.   If anyone wants another review, Dodger (PressHeartToContinue) from Polaris network talked about he views on it after seeing it on her coffee time thing she does. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DowL0r6J8kg"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3decbw,DeMatador,3,Fri Jul 17 09:06:26 2015 UTC,"This is excellent news.  I was expecting this film because it felt like they were making it its own thing and not straight adapting the series, which makes a huge amount of sense. We've been saying it from the start: you just can't adapt Attack on Titan with a small budget and an all-Asian cast. So what did they do? They created their own film out of AoT's universe. They kept the name, setting and characters for obvious reasons, but frankly they could have made it completely original -- I'm a bit conflicted on it, because I usually think that they should either stick to the source material as close as possible or make it original content altogether, but at the same time they would never be able to use a setting as interesting as this without getting sued if this was an original film. I would never have found out about the film if it was original, nor would I be as interested in it as I am.  In any case, I will definitely be watching the film after this review. And I hope all detractors of the film will read it before signing the film off entirely."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3decbw,flamojo14,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:24:07 2015 UTC,Sounds like there is no US release date yet?
ShingekiNoKyojin,3decbw,DeMatador,2,Thu Jul 16 01:28:58 2015 UTC,"I'm from Argentina, where these films never release in neither theatres nor home media formats, so I'm going to pirate it as soon as it becomes available online. Would import it, but not only are imports taxed amazingly high here, they're also very likely to be stolen as soon as they arrive.  But I'm sure the US will get a release date soon. Funimation licensed the movie for American release and claim to be gearing up for a ""fall"" release, so you won't have to wait much longer."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3decbw,luigitheplumber,2,Thu Jul 16 17:19:48 2015 UTC,"So all they kept from the original was names, walls and giant humans? And from what the trailers showed, the gore was anything but realistic. This review doesn't do much to alleviate my concerns, but whatever, I'll see it anyway.  Attack on Titan is one of the only Manga action franchises I could see adapted into a movie series with minimal changes from the source material, so hopefully if this movie keeps doing well, we'll get just that."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3decbw,SilkSk1,3,Wed Jul 15 23:13:44 2015 UTC,"With the blessing of Titan's original author to do whatever they wanted, TOHO threw all expectations out the window and just made their own movie.

Interested to see how Mikasa is handled in this film, and of course how the titans look on the big screen."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3decbw,Tearfulfriend18,2,Thu Jul 16 07:27:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, a reviewer who was covering Fate/stay night at ANN was bashing it. The story at its core was about a clash of ideologies, but the reviewer (who didn't like the author of the source material to begin with) completely bashed it, turning it into a case of ""Toxic Masculinity"".  That's basically it."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3decbw,CC1987,2,Thu Jul 16 07:33:51 2015 UTC,"I reminded hearing about it after I read the ""Toxic Masculinity"" line. The post I heard about it was on /r/tumblerinaction last month."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3deguz,Tannekr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:18:48 2015 UTC,"I'm down for this. I like this community, and while I LOVE Attack on Titan, I've gotten relatively friendly with many people and want to hear how things are going in an open-discussion style or...something. (Private messaging just feels...meh. Plus, some of the things I talk about with people in private messages are AOT related, but I don't want to make a low quality thread for my shitposting.) I mean, I know this is an AOT subreddit and not a general discussion sub-forum but hey, maybe it'd strengthen the community? :D ?  Although limitations and guidelines on what people can talk about would be nice. Please no political debates. Just things like sharing how your day was, maybe some venting, talking about things you've liked recently (such as music, games, etc.), and of course AOT related things that wouldn't normally negate creating a thread. (Like all of those lovely edits of Zackley as the doctor from The Human Centipede! :D)  Just one thread per month dedicated to that would be cool. People would just stick to that thread if they wanted off topic discussion and then move on to the next thread after a month."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dcsb9,samlee405,11,Wed Jul 15 06:51:30 2015 UTC,"What were the First King's exact aims? What is Erwin's dream exactly? What key question did Erwin ask his father? How can Zackly be allowed to remain in power? What does 'to you in 2000 years' mean, and who is the girl in Eren's dream? Where did Grisha come from and what did he know? What created the Ackerman family power, and is it related to the titan power, or the result of genetic experimentation/breeding etc.? Is there an Ackerbond that explains Mikasa's bond with Eren, Levi's with Erwin, and Kenny's with Uri, or is loyalty just a family trait? Who is Levi's dad, and does it matter? Everything about Ymir!  So many questions!"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dcsb9,Le6,2,Wed Jul 15 09:30:44 2015 UTC,"What is Erwin's dream exactly?   I could be wrong but isn't Erwin's dream just to see humanity flourish? I guess you could also say that his dream is to see a more widespread sense of justice across the country as a result of the loss of his father.   What key question did Erwin ask his father?   Given his father's response, Erwin's question was probably just about the history of the world the preceded the enclosure of humanity within the walls.   How can Zackly be allowed to remain in power?   Zachly cooperates with the insurrectionists. There was also no explicit indication of him abusing central MP of having any direct involvement in their illicit affairs.  Other than that, great questions! I'll definitely throw them on the list."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dcsb9,Le6,2,Wed Jul 15 14:17:45 2015 UTC,"It's implied that Erwin's dream is what you say, but there have been a couple of moments that have bothered me, especially his cynical comment to Pixis that humanity will always fight unless there's only one person left. Add that to the fact that Erwin was partly based on Watchmen's Ozymandius, and that Erwin has already accused himself of 'hubris', and I do worry that if all else fails he might be willing to make truly unthinkable sacrifices for the good of wider humanity - humanity beyond the walls perhaps? Humanity in titan form? You're probably right, and he just wants to see humanity free of the walls and the titans, but that doubt is there.  Same goes for Erwin's question - it was probably just about the history of the world, or it could have been about why no one remembers. I'm just curious about why we weren't told explicitly what it was.  With Zackly my concern isn't to do with MP corruption, it's entirely about his bizarre torture of the nobles and his determination to make his 'art' public. The new government just can't afford to let him do that - it could destabilize the entire revolution!"

How will she feel about the changing circumstances and all that's happened since her defeat? Why did she become a member the military. Just what is her relationship to Bertholdt and Reiner?  As far as my favorite character, I realize I haven't thought of that all too much. It's definitely a difficult question. There's just so many great characters in the cast. Levi is brutally pragmatic and a complete badass. Hange is hilarious all around and a bad ass when she needs to be. Sasha doesn't have much going for her but she's just kind of adorable and innocent. She's a nice contrast to the typical characters we see in the main cast and the many extras. Petra was cool while she was around and a good character for similar reasons to Sasha. The scene with her father was just heart breaking. Mike was a hero.  All that said, I'll probably have to give it to Hange. She's such a vital character to the show and continually acts as one of the prime persons driving the story forward and the characters to their goals. Her character has a lot going for. I really love the way they depicted her in the anime. Everyone else mentioned definitely deserve honorable mentions though."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dcsb9,Le6,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:38:33 2015 UTC,"Was the fate of Armin's parents retconned? In a flashback, he originally says they were sent out to die, but we later see the ""stupid couple who tried to fly"", and they seem to be implied to not have been sent to die when Eren's listing off names, and doesn't mention Armin's parents, but does mention Armin's grandfather.  What was Levi's moment where he knew he could do anything? Will the reveal of it be significant to the overall plot?"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dcsb9,Le6,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:42:52 2015 UTC,"AH, how could I miss Levi's ""Ackerman moment."" That's actually a great question. I really hope it's not something they overlook.   Thinking about it though, maybe it was his mother's death? Kenny's abandonment could also be a possibility though by then he was already grown and a capable person as Kenny describes."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dcsb9,tif138,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:27:38 2015 UTC,"That is a good question. I don't think we've seen the Ackermoment yet. Levi seemed helpless when Kenny found him so I don't think his mum's death was the trigger. It could have happened between then and when Kenny left, since by then Levi could beat much bigger people in a way that seems unlikely without unusual strength, but it could also be that Ackermans are naturally strong and the 'moment' gives them an edge beyond that.  When he takes Eren into his squad, Levi says that Eren needs to be 'pushed into total desperation', and I think that's because it takes a moment of total desperation to get Ackerpowers, as we saw with Mikasa. So I don't think we've seen either Levi's or Kenny's 'moment' yet."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dcsb9,whitenig999,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:01:51 2015 UTC,"It was retconned in the anime, and I think Isayama then decided to retcon it in the manga too, or maybe he was the one who told them to change the anime. In the manga Armin's parents were part of the so-called ""Wall Maria Recovery Mission"", and died with all the others. The only reference to Armin's grandfather I can remember before Eren's list in the manga is where Armin tells Shardis that his grandfather named him.   I don't think we know for sure that the balloon couple were Armin's parents. At one point I thought they might be Kenny and Kuchel's missing parents, who I assume were killed by the MPs at some point, explaining why Kenny killed so many of them. But it does now seem to be implied that they were Armin's parents."

Except that shovel story Isayama decided to tell us in a past Q&A. Surviving for so long and not an inkling about her past smells kinda fishy to me especially when there have been past characters that weren't around for all too long but we at least got some info(even if it was so small like Gelger being an alcoholic) about them."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dcsb9,luisangel2221,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:06:27 2015 UTC,What is it exactly about Ackermans and Asians that make them immune to the coordinate? Does it imply that there is something unusual about the general population within the walls? (susceptibility to be turned into titans perhaps?) Does Mikasa being both have any significance to come? Also what gives Ackermans their Ackerpowers?
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dcsb9,Le6,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:24:29 2015 UTC,"It could be pseudo-eugenics. Only the strongest/fastest etc Asians survived, and over generation seem much stronger.  Wait. But Ackerman and Asians are separate, right? Mikasa mother was half-Asian. The father was Ackerman right?  It's entirely possible that the bloodline was experimented on at some point as well.

ShingekiNoKyojin,3d9ais,HokageEzio,9,Tue Jul 14 15:23:59 2015 UTC,Yes
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d9ais,ASmileOnTop,40,Tue Jul 14 16:09:11 2015 UTC,"Maximum saltiness in the top comment Trolling aside, I think Hange would have deserved to win if chapters 35-71 were animated. We don't get to know her enough in season 1, which is why there are so many butthurt people. But don't worry, you'll appreciate Hange's greatness next year."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d9ais,Isiwjee,4,Tue Jul 14 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"As someone who doesn't read the manga, what does Hange do that makes her even close to as awesome as Shiki? I admit I was salty because IMO Shiki is one of the best, most complex and interesting characters in any anime and after watching AoT I didn't think there was anything special about Hange."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d9ais,-No-One,3,Tue Jul 14 21:03:55 2015 UTC,"I know nothing of Shiki, but I'm planning on watching those movies based on the salt overflow I've seen in the past two day.  However, as someone who's reading SnK, Hange is probably one of the more complex characters, and that's in a manga with very many well rounded characters.  I wouldn't say she's necessarily best girl material, but I don't think the hate is warranted.  I can only speak for myself, but what I like about Hange so much is how passionate she is.  She's the kind of scientist that gets everyone else around her excited about science; maybe, like Bill Nye.  She's always eager to discover and learn (similar to evil scientist tropes), but she also displays the most compassion, empathy, and respect compared to all the other characters in the story.  She's also proved to be a very capable leader and one hell of a strong fighter when needed.  Alas, she's only human (for now), so no super powers."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d9ais,Isiwjee,3,Wed Jul 15 03:50:39 2015 UTC,"Well thanks for trying to explain, but Shiki Ryougi is still the superior character in my book and I hope you'll see that when you watch KnK.   Now, if you've read the AoT manga and you think Hange is one of the best characters in any anime and you voted for her because of that, that's one thing, but the reason I was salty is:   You should only be voting in that contest when you know both characters and I have a strong feeling that the majority of people who have seen both AoT and KnK would vote for Shiki. I'm sure that many of Hange's votes came from people who don't read the AoT manga and only voted because they've seen AoT and not KnK, not because of any actual character merit. Even if people did read the manga, it was my impression that we should be voting only for what has been animated."

I think the major point of disagreement for us is going to be that I think we're voting on the all encompassing persona of the characters.  I just don't think you can get a full understanding of the character's personality, in some circumstances, with the anime alone.  An example of that would be Tifa from Final Fantasy.  I don't think she would be as popular if we were just judging on Advent Children.  If that's the case, then you're not exactly following your own rules.  You seemed to vote on Shiki v. Hange match up without knowing really anything about Hange.  On the otherhand, no I don't vote unless I know the two candidates.  I didn't vote on this circumstance. I was just disheartened to see such a cool character getting shit on, because anime-only fans don't know about her yet."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d9ais,Isiwjee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:34:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I disagree. I think we should only judge on what has been animated, considering we're voting on animebracket.com and the contest is called /r/anime's best girl contest. Also, from what you've told me, I'm quite certain I still would've voted for Shiki even if I read the AoT manga. I recommend you watch Kara no Kyoukai and then you'll be able to see my perspective."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3d9ais,Ianjh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:13:15 2015 UTC,"The fifth movie was my favorite that Ive seen so far.  The things Im confused about are:  1) What exactly are Shiki's powers?  We know she has those Mystic Eyes of Death Perception (which she obtained from her near death experience) that allow her to see supernatural things, but does she have another power?  In the third movie, Toko referenced that she was born with another power.   2) What exactly is their little group?  It seems kinda like they're supernatural investigators/hitmen?    To be honest, I think just the fact that the entire series is so chronologically fucked makes it super confusing.  I'm definitely gonna watch that remix movie in between 6 and 7 cause I hear that makes everything a lot easier to follow.  Feel free to answer stuff, but if its stuff that does actually get explained in the 6th and 7th movies, please don't answer those.  :)"

We know that Arya was after the Spiral of Origin, but why was he after Shiki?  I remember in the fifth movie he said something about her being connected to it in some way, but he was apparently even after her BEFORE she got her Mystic Eyes of Death Perception (when he intervened with her and Mikiya).  He went through the trouble of manipulating four different people to combat Shiki.  I feel like I'm just clueless and I must've missed something.  Unless the reason was simply that she had some sort of connection to it (which was never really expanded upon).  .__."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3d9ais,flyingboarofbeifong,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"I can't remember exactly what you're referring to in the third movie since its been ages since I saw it, but I'd guess she was talking about the fact that Shiki has a split personality. In the Ryougi family they usually imbue the heir with an artificial split personality as part of their Demon Hunting skills or whatever it was. Typically it's the eldest male, but Shiki's brother couldn't manage to manifest a second personality so she ended up being the heir and getting trained in their combat skills.  As for the group, Touko was once a part of the Mage's Association but left because she's a wild card. Then she made basically a freelance company where she takes on magic-related jobs among other things."

However, you should know that there is a reason why the movies aren't in chronological order and you should watch KnK in airing order (1-2-3-4-5-6-7).

ShingekiNoKyojin,3dcice,Zuko95,4,Wed Jul 15 06:15:14 2015 UTC,"The family isn't exactly clear, but Mikasa's dad is and Ackerman and Levi's mom is an Ackerman, along with her brother Kenny."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dcice,Katsup-doo-doo31,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:21:19 2015 UTC,They don't call him that in the anime because that anime hasn't gotten to the point where they reveal his Surname. You'll find more to your question as you read.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3dcice,DailYxDosE,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:52:58 2015 UTC,"When is Levi addressed as Mr Ackerman in the manga? The only instance I remember is, when Kenny asked Dimo Reeves if he knows Levi Ackerman."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3d9w85,MrGenerator,11,Tue Jul 14 17:12:34 2015 UTC,He could have bought refills at the black market. Episode 23 has an original scene in which soldiers of the military police brigade are selling merchandise to some shady men.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d9w85,toutoune134,3,Tue Jul 14 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"It is just pressurized air anyways.  Even with the technology level of SnK, seems like some people would have air compressors (although the underground is pretty poor so who would have one?).  Maybe they steal new tanks from the MP."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d9w85,Motossmozerg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:36:44 2015 UTC,Air doesn't seem like it would produce steam. My guess is it's methane or butane or something related. Which would require more advanced equipment to refill.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d9bob,wingman1990,3,Tue Jul 14 14:46:17 2015 UTC,Really cool :D

ShingekiNoKyojin,3d795u,Evilsmile,21,Tue Jul 14 01:51:42 2015 UTC,Mikasa's face looks like Angelina Jolie.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d795u,sethx33,25,Tue Jul 14 02:33:39 2015 UTC,Giving Mikasa a caucasian face is disturbing.  The American comic style is super apparent in everything else too.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d795u,jammerjoint,12,Tue Jul 14 05:39:18 2015 UTC,"It's kind of interesting.  Having watched the show in Japanese, I sort of forgot that nearly all the characters are supposed to be white except for Mikasa, who is half.  The anime style, regardless of hair/skin color and such just makes my brain think ""Japanese""."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d795u,zeronirvana,5,Tue Jul 14 08:42:20 2015 UTC,She looks more realistically asian in this than in the comics or show.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d795u,Katsup-doo-doo31,10,Tue Jul 14 08:09:33 2015 UTC,She's probably meant to look somewhat white considering how her dad is Caucasian.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d795u,jammerjoint,2,Tue Jul 14 08:36:28 2015 UTC,"Not really...the eyes, hair, and mouth are all off.  Makes her look more white, or mixed hispanic."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d795u,SilkSk1,10,Tue Jul 14 14:35:05 2015 UTC,"Couldn't find these posted elsewhere on this sub.  Greg Horn usually does American Marvel/DC covers, but I found these on his twitter feed.  The Mikasa walking away from a dissolving Titan one is especially good, IMO."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d795u,Valen_the_Dovahkiin,10,Tue Jul 14 01:53:17 2015 UTC,I feel like this is Mikasa's dream every night.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d795u,gymnasticRug,5,Tue Jul 14 14:08:25 2015 UTC,"I'm more distracted by the fact that the titan in the background is going to regenerate in a couple seconds and Mikasa doesn't look too concerned about it. Just imagine what Shadis would say if he saw this...  ""Damnit Ackermann! Titans aren't dead until you cut the f*cking nape! Quit daydreaming about quasi-incestuous sex with Jaeger-bombastic and finish the damn job!"""
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d795u,Velnica,3,Wed Jul 15 05:59:21 2015 UTC,Whenever I see mikasa art not drawn by the creators they usually somehow turn a fifteen year old Asian girl into a mid fourties american model.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d795u,Cedstick,5,Wed Jul 15 05:18:38 2015 UTC,"Well, Eren finally got some.   Love the details, it's not too incredibly 'Western' IMO. Mikasa looks a bit too smug though."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d795u,levi_lawliet,16,Tue Jul 14 08:57:06 2015 UTC,"More like Mikasa finally got him. She's wanted his titan dick for a while. Meanwhile, he's frothing at the mouth running in the other direction."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3d7x98,BenChandler,9,Wed Jul 15 03:08:40 2015 UTC,You could copy/paste their faces to cats and you wouldn't see a difference.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d7x98,pwnagekitten,4,Wed Jul 15 03:32:34 2015 UTC,Squee.  Last year I found a tree in the middle of a town that had dozens of tiny little owls with bunny ears in it.   http://i.imgur.com/AqyPFMV.jpg  Cuteness fcking overkill. It gave me diabetes.

ShingekiNoKyojin,3d7x98,BenChandler,5,Tue Jul 14 20:07:49 2015 UTC,I'm guessing that the problem is they can't monetise the video. They could try for a kickstarter or patreon. I need that in my life 2nd season is approaching would be a lot of fun...
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d7x98,The-Nitrogen-King,8,Tue Jul 14 22:08:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think they monetized it to begin with, though."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d7x98,Stiller3,6,Tue Jul 14 22:11:30 2015 UTC,Oh really? I was introduced to the show 2 months ago via Netflix so it was taken down by the time I watched it. If that's the case I don't know how other people get to keep their version of abridged episodes on youtube.

Shit. I have to shower.  Also have a newly found love for The Birthday Massacre. <333  ...Other than that my life has actually been really stressful and I've been struggling with my depression, anxiety, and anger issues--who I am and who I want to be. But Attack on Titan is keeping me afloat. I'm trying to find new friends since I've come to realize I don't even have real, true friends on the internet, much less in real life. I haven't for at least 6 years. You'd think something is wrong with me lol. I mean there is, but not in that way. Just...depression. :("

And it's so hard to go through life feeling empty, let alone trying to also figure out who you are. But it does get better, it may seem impossible but one day you'll find life easier. I also struggle with anxiety and it's a daily battle, but over time it becomes more manageable, you'll be able to tell when you're becoming anxious much earlier and be able to remove yourself from the situation if necessary.  I know it might seem a bit embarrassing but if you don't have one, and it's possible, seeing a psychiatrist could help a lot. It doesn't mean your crazy if you see one, seeing my psychiatrist has kept me stable. Being given medication won't change who you are, if prescribed the correct meds you'll find life much better.  It's okay to reach out for help, and although I may not be the best person for advice I'll try my best to help. If you find yourself in the darkest of places you can talk to me and I'll do my best to help."

It may sound a tad unconvincing, coming from a person with similar problems, but hey, we never fully know who we are and what defines us. Making decisions and altering oneself towards a certain goal can help, though. College is a good way to start - to find new interests, new friends, learn something about oneself and other people - but it's not an only option. A new job, buying a dog, starting with some sport or volunteering activities will also do the trick."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3d7x98,RosalindLettuce,2,Tue Jul 14 09:09:50 2015 UTC,I just watched the first 2 episodes this past week myself and I honestly dont know what to make of it. There's absolutely nothing grounding about this show since its utterly insane yet I was still definitely entertained. Dont know if I'll be continuing though.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d7x98,Katsup-doo-doo31,4,Tue Jul 14 14:11:22 2015 UTC,"Im currently near the endep23 and i have to admit, i would never ever rewatch this again. I heared so much good stuff, ppl claiming its their fav anime or within their top, but i was kind of dissapointed. I hate the MC so much its unbelivable what a trashbag he is. His action in the final ep dont make much sense to me. He just acts this way to keep the plot going.   But yet i wouldnt say it was wasted time. You should continue to watch. Since you were quiet entertained by it then you should give the show a shot. The mysterious part is what makes it so good for other people, i guess. As i said just a decent anime for me, but you may like it.recomend to watch like one ep per day, and maybe you get hooked someday  Ninja Edit: Taken from a internet review: This is a show for those looking for some over the top entertainment. It has action and suspense, but unfortunately also plotholes and a lead character who is a wimp for a good first portion of the series. In the end the pros do make up for the cons in this series, but it takes patience."

Who was saying that if you didn't accept Jesus you would go to hell and that all homosexuals were evil and would also go to hell, so naturally I got angry and told him off. Also I mocked him by saying Cthulhu was the one true God."

All this because I told him that he lost the argument the second he called me a ""young stupid slut"", when I had been perfectly reasonable, respectful, and polite up until that point."

Shows where his heads at, huh? Just reading it doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell you that out of shittiness this guy gets an A+ and shows how dense he is. I just hope this isn't someone who you'd have to deal with on a regular basis, the psychological issues caused by that shit would be a bit ""breaking"" to deal with(trust me, I'd know but I hope this isn't the case) and just plain toxic for everyone that guy gets involved with. Whatever the situation is, keep your chin up and whatever he says doesn't matter because he's a piece of shit, do turds in a toilet matter? And if I had a penny for every time I was called a stupid slut when I didn't deserve it I'd be one woman with a lot of fucking pennies;-)  -edit- Sorry I didn't mean to offend if I sounded brash. I've just been through ""similar"" situations and I just got fired up because from what you described it was wrong or maybe because of my many mental illnesses triggered something or maybe I was just trying to help(I know this world can be pretty unfriendly at times).

I hate fictionkin. They are fucking nuts. I saw some bitch in the armin tag on Tumblr saying how she was ""triggered"" by talks of how Armin may or may not die because she is ""literally"" Armin.  Aren't these kind of people supposed to be in mental hospitals or something like what the fuck? This bitch literally believes she is actually Armin and she says that Isayama is ""trapping"" her inside the manga and that she knows the entire story of Attack on Titan, and after going through her archive, she apparently has made posts pretending she is ""triggered"" and talks about how Isayama needs to be killed and how she wants to kill him. What the fuck.  And then of course, fellow fictionkins were cheering her on and treating her as if she is actually Armin.  Oh, but the best part? She's also ""literally"" Hitch and a few other characters. So she's all of those characters at once like what the fuck.  I mean I hate otherkin in general but fictionkin has a special place in my heart for how fucking retarded they are. If someone ever decided that they were Literally Jeantron's OC, I would drag them publicly so goddamn hard that they never show their face in public again, or flat out kill my OC and then post their blog on my theoretical blog and say ""I was inspired to kill X by this person.""

As great and loveable characters Leorio and Kurapika are, I'd seriously suggests continuing on as soon as possible to get to the moments that make HxH what it is. Not to mention that Gon and Killua as well as many other of the supporting cast are more than capable of sustaining what already is a brilliant plot.  If you are looking for a break from it all though, I'd suggest maybe a 12 episode comedy like Daily lives of High school boys or just an entirely different and short show in Parasyte which is 24 episodes long. Parasyte would probably be more to your liking with a compelling plot and amazing fight scenes."

I am actually starting to resent Killua and Gon so I think I should take a break for now because they are actually fine characters, just not the characters I prefer. Also, I don't enjoy watching long anime that much so I was probably going to take a break anyway.   As for your suggestions, I seen Parasyte before but thanks anyway.

Killua used to be hella generic as a murderous, OP child anime character but he has since developed so I wouldn't group him with Gon in that manner."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d7x98,TheJollyCrank,2,Tue Jul 14 22:55:59 2015 UTC,"No one would really disagree with you about Gon being generic with most even arguing that's the point. The difference between him and your other standard child shounen male lead is how he's handled. We only ever see the benefits and goodness of characters like Gon and never really see the consequences of being strong willed to the point of stubbornness/self destructive or perseverance to the point of selfishness.   Hunter x Hunter goes out of it's way to basically show that characters like Gon aren't the all good all successful arch types that we've been led to believe but that even they have consequences too in accordance to their characters.  But of course this doesn't mean you'll like him as a character, just that you might learn to appreciate the reasons for why he's like this."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3d4tou,Hjgduyhwsgah_RP,4,Mon Jul 13 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"I agree his artwork is better. This list is kind odd now that I look at again. It says manga artist but voters judged them by both writing and art. So why, for death note and bakuman, only Obata is mentioned instead of the duo with Ohba? And if its only the art that is being taken in consideration isayama being 12th is quite the achievement since imo his art is quite inconsistent and poor."

I have all of the episodes downloaded, converted to a lossless codec, and in my project files. Naturally this takes up a lot of memory so make sure you have the space for it.  I use a lot more space than usual because I like to have HD AMVs. To do that, I have both SD (848x480) and HD (1920x1080) versions of the show in a lossless format. They have the same file names. When I'm editing, I use the SD version for speed. But when I'm rendering, I switch it out for the HD version for quality.  I select clips either from memory (from having watched the show and edited with it before) or by scrubbing through the episodes looking for what fits the video. You can certainly watch through the episodes and mark time stamps if you need to.  As for pacing, it depends on the song. It should even vary within the song if it has both slow and fast sections. Keep flow in mind. The clips you use should follow some logical sequence, either visually (similiar color, similar motion, or action) or thematically (same characters or scene). This video of mine (anime spoilers) should be a good example for pacing and flow, although it was thrown together hastily in about 4 hours."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3d2q7w,solodomo,10,Mon Jul 13 01:30:18 2015 UTC,Interesting theory. You should be a movie script writer. Let hope Isyama has a backstory as interesting as this theories.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d2q7w,defend435,7,Mon Jul 13 02:15:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, you've piqued my interest...a lot of interesting stuff about titanium and some viable links to titans I suppose.   Couple things...    If you're drawing a connection between ""titan""  and ""titanium"" themselves, then first do the Japanese words have a similar root? It's easy to forget that SnK isn't English natively,  so drawing linguistic connections is iffy. It does have a lot of foreign language stuff though so it's not impossible. I know kyojin obviously but what's titanium?  While I like all of the information...what is the actual premise of your theory? That titans are a byproduct of some sort of experimentation with titanium serums?    Good read either way!"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d2q7w,Hellequin13,6,Mon Jul 13 02:17:59 2015 UTC,"As an element on the periodic table, the name Titanium can be easily found anywhere in the world. The story borrows a lot more from European culture and linguistics than it does Japanese anyway, so I don't think that would be a problem. I do agree that these are more interesting facts than a theory because it's hard to predict anything that will happen later from it."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3d2q7w,luigitheplumber,3,Mon Jul 13 03:11:52 2015 UTC,"I couldn't actually find any Japanese equivalents or comparisons, but I did try to look around nonetheless lol.

ShingekiNoKyojin,3d2q7w,Jonlxh,2,Mon Jul 13 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"The actual equivalent of titanium in Japanese is actually a lot closer than we think. It's チタン or romanized as chitan, and is pronounced a little like tee-tan or chee-tan. So the Japanese pronunciation of titanium actually sounds a lot like Titan. So it is possible... that Isayama may be constructing something around it. Man this is tinfoil-esque."

Edit: also I find that while many of the Mikasa figures out there have softer expressions than she does in the manga, I find that this one and Kotobukiya's do well in that regard.  Edit again: seems that the cloaked version is definitely no longer exclusive as it's now available online elsewhere other than HMV Japan."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3czdb4,kiks493,2,Sun Jul 12 06:24:54 2015 UTC,That special edition cover isn't that good.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,doctordevice,21,Sat Jul 11 23:00:57 2015 UTC,"The one I most adamantly cling to is that the girl Eren sees in chapter 1 is Frieda.  Reason number one, admittedly, is because I'd much, much, much prefer that over Eren being precognizant or from the future. Both of those are WAY too far removed from SnK's internal logic. I think there's a plausible timeline for this theory, too. Frieda absorbs the Will of the First King, and something in it compels her to visit Shiganshina (possibly because, as we just learned, Grisha is from outside the walls). Along the way, she gives Eren his scarf and wipes his memory of her existence, but some residual memories remain, just like with Historia."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,DirkDasterLurkMaster,15,Sat Jul 11 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about the ""See you later"" girl? I can see that! And definitely in light of recent events.  I saw another theory that Carla was of Reiss heritage because of her visual similarities to Frieda and Historia in the flashbacks of Ch. 71. If that's the case, and somehow Frieda knew about it (perhaps through the memories she inherited? Maybe Carla was the bastard child of a Reiss?) then it would make sense for her to visit Eren in the same way she visited Historia."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,DirkDasterLurkMaster,7,Sat Jul 11 23:37:00 2015 UTC,"That's possible, but I hope that isn't the case. A major part of Historia's role in the story is that she's one in a million; a complex set of circumstances converged to produce someone with Reiss blood that isn't under the family's control. That's a HUGE deal. To suddenly say ""oh yeah this other character was actually in the exact same position"" would cheapen the whole thing immensely."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,Midknightz,7,Sat Jul 11 23:42:03 2015 UTC,"Hmm... that's a good point. It is interesting how all the big players are the last or one of the last of their bloodlines. Historia is the last Reiss, Eren is the last (or at least only confirmed) Yeager, Mikasa is the last Asian, and Mikasa and Levi are the last Ackermans.  I'm really interested to find out what happened in the past to make those bloodlines special. I'm guessing all of them had a hand in whatever caused the Titans to appear in the first place."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,tif138,6,Sat Jul 11 23:52:47 2015 UTC,Levi is not the last ackerman. Kenny said to his old man that there was a branch of ackermans in some city.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,LeSigmu,7,Sun Jul 12 02:51:56 2015 UTC,"I thought that that was a reference to Mikasa's family. And presumably those Ackermans were all hunted down by the royal family, and only Mikasa's dad survived because he ran away rather than staying to fight like most Ackermans are predisposed to do."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,LeSigmu,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:16:41 2015 UTC,Don't forget Armin being the last Arlert and Erwin being the last Smith(to our knowledge) too ;-p
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,LeSigmu,2,Sun Jul 12 19:22:53 2015 UTC,"To go back to the memory topic on this, I think it could be in relation to when Eren was captured by Rod and then he got the memories from what happened in the chapel. So maybe Freida visited that tree at some point? And maybe since she inherited the memories of the first king maybe that meant she could see the walls being breached in the future which is what allowed Eren to dream about the events about to occur."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,Saratje,6,Sat Jul 11 23:39:33 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, your theory makes more sense than people believing in time travel in the series. It just seems too far fetched."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,ArchPenguinOverlord,6,Sat Jul 11 23:34:41 2015 UTC,I don't like the idea of time travel either. It just doesn't fit with anything else in the series so far.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,ArchPenguinOverlord,4,Sat Jul 11 23:41:10 2015 UTC,"Aswell, I dont really understand this but I feel like it just makes the series empty and pointless if time travel gets involved."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,boreleafclover,2,Sat Jul 11 23:41:58 2015 UTC,"There wouldn't be time travel. But remember that memories can be altered, including the order in which someone'd remember them."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,icrawler,4,Sun Jul 12 04:28:31 2015 UTC,"'she gives Eren his scarf'  I thought Mikasa was the one who had the memory of giving Eren the scarf, not Eren?"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,yolotheunwisewolf,8,Sun Jul 12 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"Eren gave Mikasa the scarf when they were children, just after they killed the three kidnappers. Mikasa says she's cold, so Eren wraps the scarf around her.  I think /u/DirkDasterLurkMaster is suggesting that before that, the scarf was given to Eren by Frieda Reiss. Their evidence is Eren's dream in chapter 1, where he sees a dark-haired girl wearing the scarf say ""See you later."" It is noteworthy that that dream was never explained, and doesn't make a whole lot of immediate sense, so having it be a memory that would later become very important is a very viable theory."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,whitenig999,2,Sun Jul 12 00:27:46 2015 UTC,"Ooooooooooooh, that makes so much more sense. Frieda giving him the scarf seems feasible, spooky."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,DirkDasterLurkMaster,4,Sun Jul 12 04:09:58 2015 UTC,"I think Frieda, controlled by the first king, visited Eren and said something or did something to him. Hence the title ""To you, 2,000 years from now."" We know the Reisseseseses were said to go back about 2,000 years. There's no way this information is just a coincidence. The first king could have shown Eren the information everyone thinks is lost now (titan history etc) because the coordinate is not within a Reiss. While this information may have later been wiped from Eren by Frieda/First King because of their struggling duality, it may still remain intact deep inside Eren's mind waiting for a catalyst to restore it."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,whitenig999,2,Sun Jul 12 07:00:04 2015 UTC,"When Historia and Rod touched Eren's back, Historia got back memories of Frieda.  Why didn't Eren also got it back?"

If the Reiss family has this power and the Ackermans are immune to it, it makes sense that you might have had one family--two offspring.  One sibling to rule and the other to help keep them in check.  Yours seems to make a lot of sense though maybe it's a Reiss family member from 2000 years ago in a memory that somehow passes down to Freida/Historia/even Mikasa somehow?  There's gotta be a better explanation than it just being time travel...."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,Tannekr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:27:27 2015 UTC,"then what about the title of that chapter (in which see you later eren appears) ""to you 2000 years from now"". i mean, yeah, it'll be pretty bad if it's something like time travel, but i don't want to be frieda either. maybe it's something third, even more interesting, isayama's masterpiece?  also, just realized, in the first chapter the narrator said it's year 853 (or something like that), but it's definately a lie. i don't know why, but it sure is. it can't be that year, i mean, it looks like alternate history in that year in general, but we fucking see even cameras. i don't know why it's a lie, but definately related to see you later eren and title."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,icrawler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:10:21 2015 UTC,"I personally believe that the ""to you 2000 years from now"" thing is the narrator (who I'm pretty sure is Armin) recording the events of the story after the fact for future generations so they won't make the same mistakes. Alternatively, maybe there will be a record from 2000 years ago that gives some relevant information. Hell, maybe that's what's in the basement.   but we fucking see even cameras   What?"

ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,VictarionGreyjoyyy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:29:03 2015 UTC,"Well, that excludes Frieda, I guess. But what about Grisha? He's a doctor, he could develop something that has an effect even on ackermans. Some special 'flu shot' or something."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,Hellequin13,8,Mon Jul 13 14:19:59 2015 UTC,"Not really sure if this is a theory or not, but it could be that MT and Grisha are brothers and actually MT got RBA to collect Eren to bring him back to the village and maybe somehow Grisha is still alive (highly unlikely) and the reason Reiner and Bert said they could return home when they saw MT was because they were close to Eren and he was the objective and they werent allowed back until they got Eren. That could also be the reason MT fought Reiner in Shiganshina was a sort of punishment for failing to capture Eren.  Not really used to theories so I apologize if this is highly flawed which it most likely is."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,icrawler,7,Sat Jul 11 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"I don't care if they're flawed or not, I'm just looking for some good discussion! I have friends that have watched the anime, but not read the manga so I don't have anyone to discuss anything with!  Regarding your theory - I kind of like the idea that RBA's objective was to retrieve Grisha, ordered by MT (perhaps his brother). As we just learned - Grisha is from outside the walls and might have been sent to infiltrate for some reason. If he did have some objective (likely to steal the Coordinate, which is how he knew about it in the first place) then MT would almost certainly want to retrieve him to find out what he had learned (or maybe Grisha was in contact with them throughout the years and MT had figured out that Grisha gave up on his mission, so sent RBA in to finish the job).  RBA lay low for so long because Grisha is nowhere to be found, and eventually run into his son Eren (who they give special treatment in the form of their combat training - we don't see them teaching anyone else those moves, even though there are far better fighters than Eren out there: Mikasa for one).  Then they find out that Eren is a shifter. The only shifter within the walls they know of is Grisha, so they assume that Eren ate Grisha to become a shifter, and change their objective to capture Eren instead of Grisha.  I kind of like this - it explains why RB were willing to drop everything if Eren would come with them even before learning that Eren had the Coordinate."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,LimBomber,6,Sat Jul 11 23:48:27 2015 UTC,They dont seem to know MT when they first see him. Iirc they actually talk like they want to recruit him or ask for his help in some way.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,SerChiswyck,2,Sun Jul 12 02:43:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm... that could be true. It's really not cear what their relationship with MT is. So much about him is unknown. He seems to be on the same page as whoever is in charge of RB as far as the Coordinate is concerned though. I guess I'll have to wait for some more info about RB/MT before fleshing out this theory more.  Edit: That being said, I think the theory also stands without MT being the one who sent RBA."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,WarlordOfMaltise,2,Sun Jul 12 03:19:41 2015 UTC,This makes a whole lot of sense! Although it makes me sad that they were only nice to Eren for their alterior motives and not because they were nice :c
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,Momoneko,2,Sun Jul 12 02:08:03 2015 UTC,So im new to this sub is MT the ape titan?
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,gymnasticRug,2,Mon Jul 13 01:24:26 2015 UTC,"Yes... Monkey Titan, Monkey Trouble,  and whatever other clever names people dream up lol.   Edit: also, you may have figured it out already but RBA=Reiner Bertholdt and Annie. It's another common one you'll see a lot."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,BenChandler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:31:24 2015 UTC,monkey troubles = ape titan = beast titan = c070
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,Leonhart0322,4,Mon Jul 13 02:35:20 2015 UTC,I'm on the same boat just caught up to the manga. People waited 2 years to read all that. I don't know how I'll live with 40 pages per month...  Anyway I'm pretty sure that MT and Grisha are related somehow. Maybe MT is his father or brother its hard to tell but I think MT was around a lot longer than 100 years ago. I really want to know more about RBA and why they were doing the things they were doing. Berthold always has that weird expression as if he was forced to do it or isn't 100% on board. I'm expecting to see a lot more MT next chapter maybe we will get some exposition.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,Terksl,3,Sun Jul 12 14:08:28 2015 UTC,"catalysts for titan transformation: 1) bleeding (I think we can agree on that) 2) contact with metal. e.g., Annie has a distinct metallic ring that she uses to cut herself. 3) exposure to sunlight. e.g., Eren cannot transform into a titan when he is in the well during Hange's experiments, or when he is underground during the Annie fight in Stohess  I think that the ""clear goal,"" supposedly needed to transform, is a red herring. The gang first comes up with the ""clear goal"" hypothesis when Eren accidentally transforms when clutching for a spoon. While he did have a goal in mind, the actual transformation was apparently instigated by contact with the metal spoon. So we don't need a clear goal to explain his transformation: just the combination of bleeding (his arm was wrapped), sunlight exposure (he was out of the well), and contact with metal (spoon) can explain the transformation. Another example: Eren initially cannot transform to fight Annie in Stohess, probably because he is underground. Once he is crushed by Annie, he is again in the sunlight. He finally transforms after flung debris lodges a metal girder into his chest. Bleeding, touching metal, in the sun. Boom."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,SuperDeluxeGay,2,Mon Jul 13 08:45:16 2015 UTC,"IIRC, Eren does transform underground in Stohess (at least in the manga, the whole Stohess battle is pretty different in the anime to make it more suitable to end the season). He initially can't transform because he's having trouble accepting that Annie is the Female Titan. Once he goes over everything in his head and truly accepts that Annie is the Female Titan, he bites himself again, this time with much more determination, and tranforms and bursts out of the tunnel as a Titan.  I suggest reading chapter 32 again to confirm. I just looked again and I'm pretty sure he's still underground when he transforms.  You could be onto something with the metal though. Though it's not clear if he grabbed the spoon before or after transforming (I kinda thought it was after, but that one is much less clear than the Stohess battle)."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,SuperDeluxeGay,2,Mon Jul 13 08:54:25 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty confident he transformed before getting the spoon, but I could be wrong."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,gymnasticRug,2,Mon Jul 13 13:30:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's electricity, not exactly metal. Little shock to jump-start the whole transformation. At least that would be kinda in line with big-ass lightning bolts that hit them."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,VicYesterday,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:22:16 2015 UTC,"He was wearing his 3DMG too during stohess, when he got impaled, so why couldn't he transform before the girder?"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cyizc,VicYesterday,5,Wed Jul 15 05:58:05 2015 UTC,"Really anything involving Ymir and what role she played outside the walls.  Like what was she that earned her the status of sama, yet she was still hated for her existence. I personally lean twoards her being some kind of heir to a royal family outside the walls and that she was born of adultery like Historia and was hated by close family but the general population wasn't aware of it, and like with Historia's family, Ymir's family tried to get rid of her as well, via offering her to some person or group as a sacrifice.  There's also wondering why the sacrifice called for her to be turned into a mindless titan, why not just kill her? I think that her being turned into a titan was by accident and that she wasn't the kind of sacrifice meant to be killed, I think she was less of a sacrifice and more of a gift (Ymir didn't see any difference to it though), this leads into my next theory.  Ymir may be part of some bloodline where you get shifters from. Like they're blood or spinal fluid is the ingredient for making shifters and her bloodline is capable of being shifters without the need to eat another. She was offered to some group to provide them with a resource for making shifters, and I think something may have went wrong and she became a mindless titan, like maybe they extracted too much spinal fluid in one go and she lost her natural shifting abilities. This one is more of a crack theory right now but I like it."

It also goes incredibly well with canon, hinting (sometimes even unintentionally, which is mindblowing) at recent events from the manga, some to take place in Season 2 of the anime, and some even in Season 3.  If Team Slap is up to the challenge of doing this for around 6 more years, then this series will be legendary. Because what they've got so far is outstanding."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3cj2wd,Jeantron,4,Wed Jul 8 11:26:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they definitely were neglectful. Which is part of why I want to see them so bad. (The other part being, hello, we haven't seen them yet. GET ON IT, ISAYAMA!!!!)  I love how you say supposedly died because that's my exact feelings on it. Maybe they died, maybe there's more to it. As for that theory, that may have been it as well. I like to imagine his parents were incredibly young. Like, no more than Armin's age; 15. Maybe they loved their son but didn't know how to care for him or were scared or something.   By the way, your last sentence kills me. ;_;7 That's so true it hurts. He was getting beat up and where the fuck was his mom and dad to protect him and yell at the bullies? His grandpa is old so obviously he can't do that much except take care of the wounds.  I want to believe Armin's parents truly loved him and cared for him a lot, but were still neglectful even if they didn't want to be. (Or maybe, they're plot relevant and didn't want to draw attention to themselves by even just going to the bully's house and chewing their parents out for hurting their son.)  EDIT: I forgot to mention that perhaps they weren't intentionally neglectful or didn't want to be because both of his parents worked. Maybe they were both soldiers or something that required them to be away for long periods of time. :("

ShingekiNoKyojin,3civsf,kunibob,3,Wed Jul 8 07:43:12 2015 UTC,"didn't they just announced the novel like a few days ago?! Anyways no complains from me, more SNK is fine by me."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3civsf,brickarts295,4,Wed Jul 8 09:02:00 2015 UTC,The novel was published in december 2014 in Japan. You're probably thinking about the english localization which was announced a few days ago
ShingekiNoKyojin,3civsf,brickarts295,3,Wed Jul 8 09:30:18 2015 UTC,"Whoops my bad, yeah I didn't know it was the English localization."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3civsf,KDL2000,3,Wed Jul 8 16:47:36 2015 UTC,Anyone know the synopsis of the book?

ShingekiNoKyojin,3civsf,BenChandler,3,Wed Jul 8 10:05:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, can't see why there needs to be a manga adaption. The more the merrier I guess."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3civsf,thelazyreader2015,12,Wed Jul 8 10:11:51 2015 UTC,"$$$  Edit: There seems to be no Levi involvement, so it'll likely be more like $$."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3civsf,defend435,2,Wed Jul 8 10:57:23 2015 UTC,So it's just some random conversations inserted into Mikasa and Annie's past?  I don't see why this needed a separate light novel in the first place.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3civsf,dan105,2,Wed Jul 8 16:00:21 2015 UTC,All we want is a season 2 released date.

ShingekiNoKyojin,3chy6s,Marco_Brolo_,2,Wed Jul 8 05:40:58 2015 UTC,I wonder how one would type the boy/girl signs...
ShingekiNoKyojin,3chy6s,Hellequin13,3,Thu Jul 9 00:19:45 2015 UTC,/u/hoochiex21 and /u/RecklessFury have found it I think...   凸】♀】♂】←巨人   . It's probably a score adaptation of it though. That part starts around 2:16 in /u/hoochiex21 's link.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3chy6s,RecklessFury,2,Wed Jul 8 02:03:56 2015 UTC,Sounds like 凸】♀】♂】←巨人 (Titan's Attack) to me.

ShingekiNoKyojin,3cd1ra,Midknightz,2,Tue Jul 7 02:01:45 2015 UTC,That's awesome. Great work

ShingekiNoKyojin,3ci5ss,kunibob,10,Wed Jul 8 06:44:19 2015 UTC,My favorite SnK related comment on youtube
ShingekiNoKyojin,3ci5ss,BenChandler,3,Wed Jul 8 03:35:45 2015 UTC,XD. Where did EreRi come from anyway?
ShingekiNoKyojin,3ci5ss,ClickingGeek,10,Wed Jul 8 03:31:14 2015 UTC,It all started when Levi took a boot to Eren's face.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3ci5ss,BenChandler,8,Wed Jul 8 03:37:30 2015 UTC,"Shipping the young male protagonist character with the mature, older male mentor figure is pretty common, for some reason.   Also, BDSM vibes."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3ci5ss,BenChandler,3,Wed Jul 8 11:00:45 2015 UTC,My favorite thread is a reenactment of the training scene from attack on Titan abridged.

ShingekiNoKyojin,3ce47u,hoochiex21,4,Tue Jul 7 05:03:45 2015 UTC,Yeah totally getting the special edition now. I was considering it but now im definitely getting it now.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3ce47u,kiks493,2,Tue Jul 7 05:22:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, man, I really want those cards. But I don't really care about getting the manga. Should I do it anyway?"

ShingekiNoKyojin,3ce47u,Saltail,3,Tue Jul 7 13:51:58 2015 UTC,It can be pre-ordered on Amazon. It will probably also be available at bookstores that carry Attack on Titan volumes. Not sure if it'll be a limited run or not.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3ce47u,Saltail,2,Tue Jul 7 15:20:34 2015 UTC,"alright, thanks :D"
ShingekiNoKyojin,3ce47u,LimBomber,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:49:09 2015 UTC,Which volume should I buy after finishing the anime. I got 9 first but I think it's missing some a few chapters. If so can someone PM like a short summary of what I will be missing.

ShingekiNoKyojin,3caras,Katsup-doo-doo31,3,Mon Jul 6 17:37:11 2015 UTC,Totally thought Levi's thumb was a sixth finger for Erwin and spent a good several minutes trying to figure out what was wrong. I am an idiot.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3caras,GertBrobain,3,Mon Jul 6 22:29:44 2015 UTC,Is it just me or does Erwin look kinda like Nicholas Cage in this?

ShingekiNoKyojin,3cbyox,LemonSpecter,14,Mon Jul 6 18:50:53 2015 UTC,"It's gotta be inside Maria. When they are later seen 'walking inside' they're going back into Shiganshina. There are two gates, one to the outside world, and one into Wall Maria because Shiganshina jutts out from Wall Maria: http://40.media.tumblr.com/5fb38ff2205734e2ee30b7d6ca16a5a0/tumblr_mt78ekiuFP1sid20xo1_500.png"

ShingekiNoKyojin,3cbyox,DarthMewtwo,10,Mon Jul 6 20:16:24 2015 UTC,Logic dictates they don't go to a place filled with man eating monsters.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cbyox,defend435,6,Mon Jul 6 22:52:18 2015 UTC,The district cities have two gates. One outside wall Maria (to no-man's land) and one to inside the general area between Maria and Rose. They were just outside the latter gate.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cbyox,Zaeh,-6,Mon Jul 6 20:37:55 2015 UTC,"Gonna take a wild guess and say the outside, but not that far off the walls: https://meritreview.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/peaceful.png  I mean those windmills wouldn't really work inside the walls."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3cbyox,brickarts295,5,Mon Jul 6 18:59:02 2015 UTC,"The walls would only block one direction of the wind, and even then, not nessecarily completely anyway. And the windmills are angled so that the wind would still move them.  Also, outside of the walls commonly has titans, as is the purpose of the outlier districts. They're definitely inside the walls."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3caky2,Browseitall,6,Mon Jul 6 14:50:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, here are your safety instructions:   GTFO of the internet until you have finished the show. Read the manga. There will be no argument on this point. Just do it. It is for your own good. If you don't, you will stumble upon COLOSSAL (no, literally) spoilers no matter how careful you are. Until you complete #2, do not under any circumstances whatsoever, google anything even tangentially related to Attack on Titan."
ShingekiNoKyojin,3caky2,SilkSk1,3,Tue Jul 7 14:53:13 2015 UTC,A lillte game for OP. Find the spoiler in that comment  just noticed that ive done all those mistakes lol
ShingekiNoKyojin,3caky2,sharpfan1803,2,Tue Jul 7 14:59:56 2015 UTC,Yeahhhh...I kinda got into the show right now because the abriged series I was watching OF the show was getting a little far. So I'm no stranger to spoilers. I revel in spoilers. I am the Titans. I am death.
ShingekiNoKyojin,3caky2,SilkSk1,3,Wed Jul 8 10:35:04 2015 UTC,"No, you don't understand. Read. the. manga. If anime spoilers are Krillin, manga spoilers are Beerus the God of Destruction. Read it before you are spoiled, or face the consequences."

ShingekiNoKyojin,3caky2,Leonhart0322,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:15:17 2015 UTC,"Well actually ,from the movies I've seen, Goku never actualy beats Broly, he just sorta spirit bombs him away, which is a bit of a cop-out maneuver. I feel as though Broly was preety much undefeateble, like he had an infinite amount of strenght with which he could fight his enemies. I also think that a fight between Broly and Beerus would result in the crowning of a new God Of Destruction. What I'm trying to say is you don't know me! I've seen the face of God, and guess what? It was a spoiler!"
