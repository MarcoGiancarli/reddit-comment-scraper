firefox,3e1nyx,justeducation,5,Tue Jul 21 12:48:29 2015 UTC,"A quick and hacky way to do it would be to simply catch and redirect URLs.  For instance, redirect https://www.wikipedia.org/ to about:reader?url=https://www.wikipedia.org/  If it is indiscriminate, it would break too many pages. If it is not, then you would have to see a brief flash of the website prior to it switching to reader mode, or wait for a blank page before it decides whether it is an ""article"" page. The former solution is jarring and the latter would produce a perceivable slowness in Firefox.  The three best solutions, in my opinion, are:   You decide which URLs are to be automatically switched to reader mode once you encounter a suitable site. This would be best if there are particular sites that you commonly visit and switch to reader mode. There may need to be some granularity so you don't catch all URLs of a particular domain. e.g., redirect example.com/article/* but not example.com/contact_us Use a predefined list of compatible sites for reader mode. You would need a list provider and it would need to be maintained. Use some heuristic to guess which pages are ""article"" web pages; probably determine this on the first-visit of a readerable web page."

How Firefox differentiate between a regular webfont and an icon webfont?
firefox,3e24rl,Fanolian,3,Tue Jul 21 14:39:04 2015 UTC,"No. Firefox does not. Icon fonts usually place their icons in PUA where a regular web font, and a regular local font, are not using.  If you ""set browser.display.use_document_fonts to 0 and gfx.downloadable_fonts.enabled to true"", it means that Firefox use your own defined font first. When it can't find a glyph (charcaters, icons, emojis, whatever), Firefox looks for it from the font the site intends to use.  You can read bug 789788 comment #118 and #142/143 for more details.  According to the bug report, imgur is still affected. Imgur's icon font tells the browser to draw a P (Latin capital p) as a cloud, and use it as the icon for the upload image button.

This has already been brought to their attention, but after almost one year it has never received any attention: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1031519  It should be more relevant, because more often users are prefering the web interface to dedicated apps. The Facebook app, for example, was so restrictive, invasive, enormous and consumed lots of resources to the point that lots of users started using the web interface instead: far lighter, more control and one less thing occupying space. The impact has been so great that Facebook went ahead and made a Lite version of their app which is basically the same as using the web version, but with more ""data mining freedom"" for Facebook.  YouTube is on the same boat, huge app, restrictive and ads constantly evading ad blockers on android, it is only a matter of time more people start moving to the web version as well. The only things preventing this migration is the fact that only Chrome can play YouTube videos on Android and not very well, you have nothing besides the video itself (no annotations, no quality selection, no subtitles, etc). However, even Chrome for Android has a decent Fullscreen api which doesn't show any soft keys allowing for a full viewing experience.  This is an area that Firefox could shine now since it is the only browser that allows the installation of dedicated add-ons and with even more users now spending more time on YouTube for Android, this could be a great time to expand its market by providing a unique experience that to this date no other browser provides, as far as I know. Another excelent point in favor of Firefox is its ability to continue playing in the background, which means that you can have YouTube playing and your screen off or phone locked. Chrome does not do this nor does the YouTube app.  That is if they would just fix their Fullscreen api, otherwise users will simply prefer Chrome over Firefox (despite Firefox's advantages/benefits) due to the simple fact that Chrome's fullscreen is better, as any fullscreen experience should be."

There were many changes since January 2015 in both develop and multi-process branches on official VimFx github repo. From my experience that ridiculous lag when for example f key is pressed is caused by add-on not being adopted for new upcoming multi-process architecture. Add-on author knows about it and started working on it.. Personally I will not use multi-processes until complete VimFx support because it's more important to me to have nice VIM keys than multi-processes in Firefox. Also donating some money to add-on author via official Mozilla Add-on page would be nice and could possibly accelerate codding effort.

firefox,3dq8wn,jazavchar,41,Sat Jul 18 11:44:34 2015 UTC,this is not something to worry about.  Firefox actually does comparatively little IO; when people talk about SSD write limits they are typically worried about enterprise systems that write gigabytes per second 24/7/365. A consumer workload comes nowhere near this.
firefox,3dq8wn,soluko,24,Sat Jul 18 13:12:05 2015 UTC,"i think people should just stop worrying and learn to love their SSDs, without constantly thinking about things like write endurance. an SSD probably won't outlive its user, but as long as you don't run a corporate database server off of a TLC-based device, the drive doesn't have a manufacturing defect or a faulty firmware, the average user shouldn't have problems with using a modern SSD for at least a couple of years. and if the drive should really become faulty after 5 years or so, i wouldn't be that mad neither, because then we will have even better drives for a fraction of the cost.  TL;DR don't worry about SSD longevity."

firefox,3dq8wn,fireattack,9,Sat Jul 18 20:58:51 2015 UTC,Quick answer: no. What do you mean with negative impact on a SSD anyways? Lifetime? Firefox is just another program that reads and writes data to your drive - and no normal browsing habbit will ever exceed the specs of your drive (the estimated / guaranteed amout of data you can write on your drive).

firefox,3dqo6p,marafad,8,Sat Jul 18 14:56:42 2015 UTC,"That github page uses a non-standard feature that Firefox doesn't yet support, called innerText. It clearly wasn't tested on Firefox, because simply using a similar standard feature, nodeValue, would make it work on all browsers for that case. Firefox is considering adding support for innerText, but since all browsers support it differently except for this simplest case, there is much work to be done.  Coursera has a bug reported with Firefox which nobody has followed-up on here. It sounds likely that they're using web videos in a format that Firefox doesn't support well yet, causing performance issues. Hopefully Firefox will fix that soon enough, given one of their current primary focuses is web video (MSE to be specific). It would probably be good to get some more info in that bug report to make sure.  There have also been severe performance issues with Amazon that are being investigated, which are both a result of Firefox inefficiencies and Amazon just not caring how inefficient a page is in Firefox (in fact their code actively seems to go out of its way to make Firefox seem less efficient than other browsers). Hopefully these issues will be ironed out by Firefox 41.  One other thing: Explorer and Firefox are starting to get an initiative going to document the Webkit-specific features (which Chrome has) and make them a kind of a web-standard of their own, so that other browsers can support them as well. This is the price we pay for all of the slapped-together prototype HTML5 features that Apple added to their browser for early iOS support, which lazy and over-eager web devs never adjusted to their standards-compliant versions later."

firefox,3dp4rn,HardKoreG,6,Sat Jul 18 05:41:50 2015 UTC,"...Issue? Force them on people...? The way you say this, it almost sounds like you think a Mozilla employee is standing there with a gun to your head, making you use Pocket against your will. They're not. It's an icon in the UI that is inactive, that you can easily hide. There isn't even any non-open Mozilla code involved, until you actually sign up and use Pocket. It'd be nice to not have it at all if you don't use it, but it's not what you seem to think it is.  So why is this such a big deal, given that you'll never even use (or have to use) the non-open bits? Why must you assume that nobody wants to use Pocket (and call Mozilla liars) just because you don't personally like it? In fact, what sudden mystic philosophy are Mozilla going against here, given that they already integrate with Google's services in the same way? Or is that different, because you don't personally mind Google definitely collecting your info if you opted into using their search engine (assuming Pocket even does)?"
firefox,3dp4rn,DrDichotomous,4,Sat Jul 18 02:59:22 2015 UTC,For my part i would be completely happy if FF just asks me if i want e.g. pocket in my toolbar or not before it just places itself there... Just a informative pop-up screen after every update (when there is something new) that highlights out what these new feature are and if I want to enable them or hide them. Or something like a Firefox news center would be awesome....
firefox,3dp4rn,AzureSkyEyes,2,Sat Jul 18 07:23:09 2015 UTC,"I certainly have nothing against something like that, especially since knowing what new features are and what they actually do seems to be the biggest sticking point when you really get down to why people are really upset."

firefox,3dp4rn,DrDichotomous,2,Sat Jul 18 06:53:49 2015 UTC,"Google Search, for starters (especially in the search bar). If you use it, it also connects to Google's servers, which run code you do not control, and Google openly collects data profiles on their users. If you don't use it, it's just like not using Pocket - it's still there in Firefox, if you want it. Up until they changed to Yahoo, it was even the default search engine.

Instead of making it perfect for just about everyone by polishing the existing stuff, the people in charge of design decisions decided to go the easy way and just kill anything that was ""too complex for most users to understand"". Oh, Australis could have been beautiful, it could have been another Firefox 4. But no, it had to be rushed out to v29, an oddly odd number if nothing else. And the whole thing was half baked - what was supposed to be released then hasn't been released yet and what nobody wanted was released as if it was something great.

So it loses most benchmarks, does winning or losing actually change anything?  Pale Moon does what I want it to do, when I want it to, and doesn't do what I don't want it to do. That's more than I can say about Firefox, which makes me to install 3rd-party extensions just to restore a simple functionality that was a part of the browser more than a year ago now, makes me disable functionality that was never supposed to be built in, and it does what it wants when it wants, sometimes even overriding the user's explicit settings.  To be honest, I am kinda worried about Pale Moon's future. Looks like as Firefox progresses on, less and less fixes and updates will be compatible with Pale Moon, which means more and more work for it's developers, which might as well eventually lead to the project's death or a complete alienation.  But I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. For now, I'm as happy as can be with my current browser of choice."

Firefox has handled no-cache (with https) the same way for ages, so the page gets refreshed.  Many other if not all other browsers ""ignore"" no-cache header for back and forward navigation.  Ignore is in quotes because the spec says that it should be ignored for back and forward buttons - I just personally don't agree with this.  Reddit however should not use no-cache header, IF we assume that the way Firefox handles it is the correct one. I am not sure what good does no-cache header bring to other browser either if they just ignore it anyway.  I hope this helps."

Under what circumstances would you ever want the back button to give you something other than the previous page exactly as it was when you viewed it?  And, even if you manage to think of one or two cases, how are they not vastly outnumbered by cases where showing something that isn't the page exactly as it was is wrong?   Reddit however should not use no-cache header   But then you would get old comments whenever you clicked on a comment thread you had seen before.  Going to your user page would give you an old view of your comments, with old karma scores and possibly not including the most recent comments.  Reddit pages should not be loaded from cache, but the semantics of the back button are that it moves between views.  It does not ""load"" pages.  The involvement of the cache is an implementation detail"

Maybe Firefox should indeed ignore no-cache for back-forward action. I still think there should be a way to send some header that would force reloading even for back button, but it should be its own thing - not related to no-cache. The use-cases for this might be marginal but I bet some services would want to use it."

Separate tabs into individual processes so that a runaway script in tab six doesn't kill a fifteen tab expedition.   Separating the plugin container from the main process was one of the best decisions the Firefox dev team has made. Keep doing that.   Kill rogue addons/processes/scripts that have become unresponsive. Don't even display a message, just kill the process.   Remember, just because some of us have monster rigs doesn't mean Firefox should bloat up like Violet Beauregard. I like to run browsers along side games in windowed mode. Performance is very important to me."

Maybe it will take another year, but at this rate it could be good enough to enable for most users by version 41. We'll have to wait and see.  I've even seen signs on Bugzilla that they will not enable e10s for all users on initial release, just those who aren't running add-ons and such that are untested/problematic.

On your existing install, open your profile directory and go in to the extensions directory. There will be a directory named isreaditlater@ideashower.com (or possibly a file named isreaditlater@ideashower.com.xpi). Copy that to the extensions directory of your new install.

Our forums provide us with a great way to interact with users who may be having problems we want to dig further into. There aren't a lot of users here, but the high quality data we can get is useful. Social Media, Reddit, etc. These all are useful places for us to learn about breaking issues in a release before we would learn about them in our closer channels (like crash stats) Surveys. We deploy surveys on both the about:home page and through heartbeat. These are normally to a small subset of users (so if you haven't seen one before that's ok) but the data we get from them helps us establish baselines and deep dive into how our general audience feels about hot button topics (like pocket). Telemetry, Firefox Health Report, Crash Stacks, etc. These are super useful data sources for us and other teams (we aren't the main consumer of the data from these systems but we do use them a lot). I promise, we aren't invading your privacy, but the data we get here helps us know where to look to fix major issues. Please turn them on! :)   UX and other groups have other data sources (like focused studies where they actually bring real users into an office and ask them questions) but my team doesn't use them as a primary decision driving factor (though we do read the reports and it does help us from time to time)."

But if you insist use this addon for mass setup - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cck2wizard/    Not sure how it works but perhaps the right one for the job.

I have no control of it afterwards.  I hope you can appreciate the need to manually set this stuff on every computer.  I do ensure that these changes work before hand.   My point is that so much of this is disabled and to satisfy so many's needs it seems an impossible task fraught with possible error.  More intelligent defaults by Mozilla seems to be the correct route to take.

We have projects coming out in coming months as well like e10s which will help speed up Firefox as well.

Let's say asm.js for example is probably faster than Flash nowadays. Or using something like MSE for Youtube might allow you to have less traffic. Of course we always have to lookout for things that are in Flash, but we don't yet provide. (e.g. copying stuff to the clipboard has been problematic)  Edit: Mobile support!"

I know it doesn't compare to things like Pocket integration (which, while we're feedbacking, really should be a separate add-on and not baked in and enabled by default), Hello getting up in your grill after install, or DRM... but I'd like to talk about the refresh / reload / stop button. It's tiny, out of the way, and can't be moved by the user without installing an add-on. Is there any chance at all that we'll ever be able to customize our navigation bar out of the box again? Pleeeease? :(  More general feedback: I believe that functions that are services or are complementary to the browsing experience (Hello wrapper, for instance) should be opt-in rather than opt-out. A list of Mozilla add-ons after each update with a big green INSTALL NOW button beside the name and description would be great. That way people who want that functionality can easily add it, it's exposed to users on each update so they know it exists, and it satisfies users who don't want to be surprised with new buttons in their toolbar or other disruptive changes to their browser.  It just seems to me that that's what add-ons are for.

That said, I have been in the security team at Mozilla, mostly focused on web security, for 4.5 years - in that time I have repeatedly asked teams that fork both Firefox and Chromium what they are doing to meet or at least emulate the security effort that we put in.  We currently have thousands of volunteer and staff engineers working on a variety of issues.  We have several dozen security team members, and security focused engineers working on reviewing, testing, and fuzzing dangerous features for Firefox.  Google has a very large security team, as does Microsoft, and all 3 have bug bounty programs to incentivize security research by third parties.  We have strong connections to other research groups that share information with us in advance of public release so that we can work to protect our users.  Palemoon has repeatedly requested advance information about Mozilla security fixes, but due to a lack of effort on their part to participate in our security community, we have been unable to vet their team members sufficiently to grant them security access.  They are maintaining a legacy fork of a very old version of Firefox, and their code base both introduces substantial code, while ignoring, deleting, and rewriting platform features that are heavily influenced by a move towards better support for sandboxing.  I get the desire to have a different UI, but it is a disservice to their users to advertise themselves as being secure since apparently they also remove all tests, and AFAIK, they have no fuzzing or security testing team.  The Palemoon team recently rebranded their fork of the rendering engine to emphasize the fact that it is no longer Gecko, and you can find my thoughts on that here. </rant>"

Even being fully aware of the potential security issues, I'm still considering trying out moving to Palemoon, just because I don't approve of the direction Firefox is moving. I would expect Palemoon to improve over time as it matures. Meanwhile, Firefox has started bundling proprietary code, has changed a lot of the UI up to be more Chrome-like, at the expense of functionality, has removed the option of restoring the old UI in about:config, lags to hell and back on Amazon, and has done all that while still missing important features that users have been requesting for years."

I recently clean installed an OS and Firefox, since I have my bookmarks in Firefox sync I can usually just sync it. Now, after setting up Firefox (I usually delete the default bookmarks before) and entering my Sync data, there is the prompt as to what you want to sync. This is where I screwed up, I accidentally double-clicked on the Bookmarks box, which led to all of my bookmarks (around 200-300) being purged. The computer having been recently formatted, I have no bookmarksbackup file laying around. There were many important work bookmarks among them.   Now, I have browsed the interwebs and it doesn't seem like you can restore the bookmarks. Can you please tell me that is not true?  As for browser feedback:   finally listen to what your supportive core user base wants (hint: it's not 60-year old people), the people who have stuck with Firefox since its early stages. You ignored major parts of your community on Australis; now that it's finally been implemented it's already outdated in its design (see Windows 8 - 10) don't just shadily integrate third-party addons without any major announcement and consideration of feedback from your users Firefox users enjoy its massive customizability, so don't just do away with about:config features that you fear might sooner or later confuse tech-illiterate people (Bugzilla is down right now, but I'm talking about the bugs concerning removal of the devedition theme in non-dev editions and the removal of pocket.enabled or browser.newtab.url. The same thing with extension signing. It's neat little things that makes using Firefox feel good. The more you insist on limiting or cutting down little details like that, the more you alienate your users. Don't just copy whatever Chrome does. Chrome removing FTP support? Firefox monkeys see, Firefox monkeys do.   The user numbers for Firefox have been decreasing steadily. Focus on what your community's strengths are. They want a browser that values their privacy and is more powerful than Chrome, but also one that does not treat them like little children when they are first using a PC.

This is a difficult balancing act, especially considering the very real threat of malware that hijacks millions of our users (in fact, this very problem was why we had to delay the Firefox 39 release) and they tend to take over these hidden prefs so that users can't easily un-infect themselves.

Neither really tracks CPU usage, but they might help correlate other resources.  At some point in the near future, the e10s project will be shipped out in release builds, which will split Firefox into a browser process and a web-content process. At the start, there only be the one web-content process, so it still won't really point out a badly behaving tab, but it's a necessary step in the feature's development. After things work smoothly enough with the single content process, Firefox can start splitting that content up into multiple processes (per-tab? per-origin? per-window? dunno...), which is when you could start directly correlating tabs to resource usage."

firefox,3d9ixd,SnickeringBear,2,Wed Jul 15 12:29:50 2015 UTC,"I've been looking for an opportunity to vent here for a while about what I perceive to be the degradation of my favorite web browser. I suppose now's as good a time as any.  I like the technical knowledge and acuity to grasp the situation but, I've noticed a pretty steep decline in performance on nearly all versions of Firefox past version 37. It's gotten to the point where I've considered ditching the browser entirely.  I've been refusing to use Chrome due to it being closed source, at least the damn thing works.  Lately it feels like Firefox (even Beta and Dev builds) just chugs after it's been running for more than ten minutes. I've had the developer edition open for about fifteen minutes and it's already blasting past the one gig mark. Firefox leaks memory pretty badly, after the two hour mark it will easily consume beyond two gigs.   It also hitches and hangs up at random intervals. This can start happening after five minutes of use or thirty.   I'm using the bare minimum of addons (ublock and greasemonkey). The only greasemonkey script I have active blocks ad.fly, that's it. My fiance has been experiencing all of the same performance issues and has ditched Firefox entirely as a result.   I've rebuilt Firefox from sync six times now. I've purged profiles, disabled addons, run in safe mode, the works. I can't imagine I'm the only one who's noticed this."

We'll proably also need a few million dollars worth of Adobe taking as many developers as it can off of what makes money for Adobe and assigning them to make Flash more secure and consume less electricity.  1, 2, or even all 3 of these things could happen.  And shumway is open source isn't it?  At any time anyone other than Mozilla can fork it and keep working on it if they see a reason to.

I think developing Shumway don't worth the effort.  I think the best solution is force SWF content to die. It's proprietary, was never a web standard and it's not accessible.   We have a huge share of users accessing the web using mobile devices exclusively and they are not missing swf content.  Creating another player from scratch, until it reaches the same level that Adobe Flash Player, just to keep these shitty content alive is absurd. What's the next step? Recreate Java? Silverlight? It don't need to be a browser responsibility. It need to be the content owner responsibility. If the content owner want their content alive, they need to find the solution to keep it.  We have different types of swf content still online: big companies using old tech, video websites, flash games, small business or personal websites, old content still valuable.  For corporate and video websites, they will need to hire professionals to recreate their website. Most of them already are converting their sites for be responsible. And if not, they knew it could happen some day. They already have seen it happening when their websites worked only in IE 6, 7 and 8. After all,  smartphones are trying to access their content for almost a decade.  Flash games can be ported to another format or converted to a standalone executable or even be converted into an app.  For small business and personal websites or they hire professionals or use a flash-to-html5 tools as you mentioned in option 1.  For old content still valuable (like art, animations, classic websites) we can use convert tools, transcribe the content and backup it in databases like Archive.org.  This will be a huge effort obviously, but it will mobilize the web development market in a good way and these websites will be much better and more accessible than before."

Anyway, from the shumway wiki   Shumway can be used from JavaScript directly, not only through ActionScript3. This makes it easy to write new content that relies on the well known and understood Flash APIs.    It sounds to me like it could become possible for developers to include some sub component of shumway just as easily as they include jQuery. But that component is likely gigantic which is why they decided to make shumway an add on."

Then they will pause all Flash by default, using the click-to-play method.  When Chrome 44 hits, it will broke many banks websites around the world that use Flash as a security layer.  The next step probably will be show an alert explaining how Flash is insecure and asking if the user want to disable it. They did campaigns like this in Google websites when they wanted users to stop using old IEs (remember ""Install a better browser""?).  Doing a campaign inside the browser can be pretty effective.   Then they will bury the option to re-enable it inside Settings and few users will know were it is, like they did when they blocked NPAPI plug-ins. Then they will move it to the Enterprise Policy system and non tech-savy users will have bad time trying to enable it again.   At some point they will show a report saying how few users have Flash enabled and that they are going to drop support of it.  Safari already is disabling Flash completely if the user is not running the last version. Firefox did something similar when Adobe failed to patch a zero-day vulnerability this week.  Apple is walking towards to make OS X works identical to iOS, so ditching Flash probably is a planned step. They do it all the time. Even more because they were the first company to be against Flash.  I can see another zero-day vulnerability being discovered and all of them having to disable Flash for days and some will take measures to it be permanent."

There was some concern over whether finishing our own implementation would turn into a time, money and engineering sink with a rough reliability, as the new Sync implementation was for a while, and whether we actually have enough resources (that could reasonably be allocated to it!) to make the end result as good as Pocket. The alternative, to integrate Pocket if they agreed to open up the relevant parts of their code and revise their privacy policies, was essentially free in comparison.  There's an implicit judgement call there whether having the best product (Pocket) and having it ""for free"" outweighs the trade-off of outsourcing the feature and having it be provided by a third party.  It's pretty clear what power users (and part of Mozilla's developers) think of that trade-off, but the user sentiment studies for the whole user population paint a different picture so far."

I think the weight in the picture, which is what I get on Windows 10 just selecting Fira Sans as default font, is Medium. There's also a ""regular"" weight, a bit thinner than medium, but it's not in the font selection menu  And my opinion on the i's is that they're pretty cool. It's a very readable font on small and large displays, and yet it's also highly stylized and distinct from other fonts. And I think the way they handled the i's and the l's actually did wonders for readability of English text in particular.

firefox,3d1pw0,BenL90,56,Mon Jul 13 00:54:47 2015 UTC,I use FTP all the time. How much of code bloat or security issues arise from FTP? I assume less than Pocket?
firefox,3d1pw0,rn10950,26,Sun Jul 12 20:56:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know why /u/johnny0055 is being downvoted, both pocket and hello are very simple implementations. They aren't complex, and they don't really use any resources if you aren't using them.  /u/xelaseer explains it well here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/3be0c6/mozilla_removes_option_to_change_new_tab_page/csle7e5   I know this still runs against the charges of replacing necessary 'features' with 'bloat'. For the record I don't agree with the Pocket decision, but to call Firefox Hello bloat or, even the misguided Pocket campaign for that matter, eschews either ignorance or disingenuous arguments. It has been repeatedly shown that Pocket integration is merely a few lazily-loaded API calls to a HTML webpage, while Hello is essentially a small, lazily-loaded UI on a web standard feature with Firefox Account integration. The fact that these are lazily-loaded features is key here, and means that they will contribute such a negligible amount to memory usage when not in use that any increase would likely fall within noise measurements on a system. Moreover, the removed 'feature' is an advanced, hidden preference used by a few advanced users who can easily replicate this functionality, and whose existence negatively affected exponentially greater numbers of less advanced users, who often have problems doing even basic troubleshooting."
firefox,3d1pw0,bwat47,24,Sun Jul 12 23:56:06 2015 UTC,"You're probably assuming wrong. Pocket is such a tiny amount of code. Dealing with FTP properly is pretty complex.

After all, going by this subreddit, you've only seen a small portion of Firefox users that are likely not at all similar to the majority.  As for removing FTP, I'm not so sure it's a good idea.

firefox,3d2aug,darkmyself,2,Sun Jul 12 23:16:48 2015 UTC,"This happened to me when I update to Firefox v39 - my history stopped working.  My solution was to dump the SQLite database to a text file, and then remake a new DB. The history file is called ""places.sqlite"", and is located in the default profile folder inside %APPDATA%/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles (on Windows) and ~/.mozilla/firefox on Linux (and probably OSX).  I installed SQLite, and then did the following command in a terminal:  echo .dump | sqlite3 places.sqlite.corrupt > bplaces.sql   This dumps the database. You then need to add a couple of pieces of metadata to the top of the bplaces.sql in your favourite text editor:   PRAGMA page_size=4098;  PRAGMA user_version=28;   Then re-import that DB into the SQLite format:  echo .quit | sqlite3 -init bplaces.sql newplaces.sqlite   Check that's worked, then replace places.sqlite with newplaces.sqlite and fire up firefox. It should all be fine.  If you're not comfortable messing around on the command line, you can probably find a free SQLite GUI somewhere on the web. You'll probably still have to add those two pragma statements manually though.  edit: Whoops, forgot to include the file location."

Not quite, I think - nothing is saved to the browser. The theory is that even if you give everyone the same instructions for drawing a picture, everybody's result will be slightly different depending on OS, browser, graphics card, etc. The result is hashed and sent to the server. The next time the server receives that hash, it can be fairly certain it's the same browser and join the dots so it knows that someone likes Stilton and Matchbox 20.  Anyway.  Could it just be that CanvasBlocker and Tor are looking for different things, or using different methods?    YouTube does try to access pixel information - when a video can't be played it shows the message on a staticy background like an old untuned TV. That static animation is the only direct reference to getImageData I can find in YouTube's scripts - though that doesn't mean there isn't an obfuscated reference.

I'm going to say as much as 30%-50% less. However, if you're using ad blocker and few other addons, that's going to increase the RAM usage over time if you keep the browser open, and the browser in general will be a lot slower. So you might save significant RAM with the cost of performance if you use Firefox with ""heavy"" addons.  I wonder if it will be better for now to use Chrome and just increase the Windows page file size so programs will use HDD/SSD to substitute RAM instead of crashing. This will eventually slow some program down but you should test it to see how it works out.  Firefox will improve the performance at the end of this year."

Firefox would have a much larger user base if it was superior to Chrome, but I think in the opinion of many people, even tech-savvy people, it isn't. Personally, I find that the UI of Firefox looks like a kludge on OS X (wrong fonts, spacings, etc.), and is impractical (you can't nearly have as many tabs open as in Chrome without scrolling...). I think this is a commonly shared sentiment and is much more important than speed. All computers/browsers are fast enough nowadays anyway."

Firefox had a time where it was clearly inferior to Chrome (especially for the layman) and while it still might have some problems, the gap isn't as big as it has been.  The upside of Firefox, which many people don't get, is that it's open source. Yes, I know that chromium is open source, but we're not talking about chromium.  Google has some very good products. When I flash my phone with a new firmware, I don't have to backup my contacts or emails. When I want to drive to an unknown destination, I don't need a navigation system. Nevertheless, Google is still a company and a company is always looking to make money, even if their products are free. This is no blame, just a simple fact.  This is why I try to avoid those products of Google that I can live without.  This brings me to a part of your comment that I want to address mostly:   Firefox would have a much larger user base if it was superior to Chrome, but I think in the opinion of many people, even tech-savvy people, it isn't.   Something being the opinion of many people doesn't make it right.   Example: On reddit a lot of ""tech-savvy people"" will advise you to use Google DNS as (primary) DNS service, which most times will have no benefit over using the DNS server of your provider. In my case the average ping to my provider's DNS server is 18ms, while the ping to 8.8.8.8 is 23ms. Would I notice the difference? No, but why give Google another possibility to see which websites I visit if I don't have to."

Get a call from a client about another website, they call 3 times a week so I tend to always have about 30 tabs related to their site and their parent company site always open. One of the things they requested today requires some research into iOS Safari bugs, need another group of 15 tabs to do that. I need to check some personal info for my girlfriend (amazon, my gmail, her gmail, her facebook, google photos, online banking, other stuff, at least 10 tabs). Many people have 2 or 3 of those things as pinned tabs. Having a dozen pinned tabs taking up 1/3 of the space of the tab bar made no sense to me so I keep them all in a tab group. End of the work day I'll have youtube and reddit and tabs spawned from reddit in another group (or in Chrome). Another client calls at the last minute and I need to make another tab group for a dozen tabs researching a bug in jQuery UI.   Let's say I didn't actually finish anything today. I still need to continue all that research tomorrow, so I still need most of these tabs later. However more than half of them were created today so firefox is taking up a ton of memory right now. Quit firefox, open firefox, no more memory hog. Firefox opens instantly. All the tabs and tab groups are still there but it only shows the tabs from the last used tab group and it only loads the last used tab. No time is wasted loading anything else until I activate another tab. Compare that to Chrome. I only have 12 tabs open in chrome right now. In total only 3 websites make up those 12 tabs so they share a lot of resources. But if I quit and restart chrome right now my laptop with Core i7 and 16 Gigabytes of ram will slow to a fucking crawl for at least 2 minutes as it reloads all 12 tabs simultaneously."

You can limit the amount of virtual memory for a program:  Simply run ulimit -Sv 4000000 in a Terminal Emulator and then launch firefox from there. This sets a soft limit (-S) for the amount of virtual memory (hence the v) of ~4GB for all programs that are run in this shell.

Source: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/44985/limit-memory-usage-for-a-single-linux-process  (note: ulimit seems to be a shell-builtin command so you'll need to consult the manual of your shell if you want to get more information on it.)

firefox,3cvjz5,arena_say_what,7,Sat Jul 11 03:20:22 2015 UTC,Twitch is Flash-only I believe. So guessing this comes down to Flash's version or usage on Safari vs Firefox.
firefox,3cvjz5,caspy7,8,Sat Jul 11 03:58:04 2015 UTC,"While Safari is the most efficient browser due to home OS advantage, your problem is due to Twitch's design.  Twitch uses Adobe Flash in most browsers. Flash is a huge CPU hog despite the hardware acceleration update a few years ago. (It's also a big security hole on your computer). They use Flash because it's a popular plugin and it supports DRM, data mining, and advertisements whereas with HTML5 <video> they're still waiting on those business-friendly features to be implemented in all browsers. The exception is Safari, which supports HLS.   Another issue is that Twitch's ""source"" quality can as high as 1080p60, which is non-trivial as many GPUs' fixed function decoder can only handle 1080p30, so hardware acceleration doesn't activate and the CPU has to do the work. Also if you don't have the video fullscreened Flash has the scaling done in CPU instead of GPU.  One solution is to stop watching in a browser and use Livestreamer to shunt the raw video stream into a player program with hardware acceleration. Twitch doesn't like this because you won't be viewing ads. Frankly they are bringing that problem onto themselves because Flash video is a CPU hog and security vulnerability."

Apparently, 14 years ago, Firefox was strongarmed by banks into breaking the back button for https pages that use no-cache.    With the now-pubic hard evidence of the NSA's activities, many are pushing for websites to use encryption.  The Let's Encrypt initiative, for example.  But even though modern computers are fast enough that the overhead of encryption is negligible, in Firefox https websites, such as Reddit, are much slower than http websites, because the back button spends a substantial fraction of a second reloading the page from the network.  (Or several seconds, for slow connections and mobile devices.)  The rationale for the previous decision was that https indicated that a page contained especially sensitive information, and that, if the back button were allowed to reload no-cache https pages from the bfcache, people would access these especially sensitive pages on public computers, log out of the website, and not close the tab or the window, and then nefarious actors would be able to hit the back button and see the sensitive information.  But this is a very unusual scenario.  It only affects people who access sensitive websites on public computers and refuse to follow best practices even when they are frequently reminded by the logout page itself.  And even then, my experience with banking websites is that the information they contain is not particularly sensitive (unless you consider your account balance to be sensitive).

I do not think Firefox should be degrading the user experience of the vast majority in order to protect a tiny fraction of people who are using their computers incorrectly.   Your viewpoint seems to hinge on this idea that the majority of users are competent at using their software and have a general understanding of things like how to stay secure while using a public computer. That the number of users who don't quite understand how to use their computer safely and reasonably is small. I strongly disagree with that viewpoint (although I have no particular opinion on the specific bug in question).  There are users that think they aren't using the internet but actively use Facebook. More recently, we ran a user study on Tracking Protection where users blamed Tracking Protection for causing video playback issues, crashes, etc. even after it was demonstrated to them that the issues occurred with it disabled. We literally showed them they were wrong and they chose to believe otherwise."
firefox,3csi9u,pogeymanz,5,Fri Jul 10 16:11:19 2015 UTC,"I think the question of user competence should be secondary to following standards and performing ""correct"" behavior. Like you said, I'm not necessarily commenting on this particular bug, but I think it's possible to coddle users too much.  Driving a car is dangerous, but I doubt that GM or Ford are going to release a car that only goes 15 MPH because so many people are bad drivers.  If you choose to coddle the users, then the tracking protection study that you site should lead you to conclude that you should remove tracking protection from Firefox, no? It upset the users, therefore it should go, even though the users are clearly wrong."
firefox,3csi9u,Osmose1000,7,Fri Jul 10 16:38:20 2015 UTC,"Good point; we shouldn't ship software that is crippled under the assumption that users are incompetent.

firefox,3csi9u,pogeymanz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"True. I wonder what your opinion is on a possibility that I mentioned in another comment in this thread. Namely, that the current behavior of not caching HTTPS pages with no-cache should be the behavior in private browsing mode. Regular mode should be changed such that the back button works as expected (""show me what I was just looking at"").  This has a few advantages:   In regular mode, history works as expected. It is fast and semantically correct. It encourages a user to use private mode for sensitive stuff, which is kind of what private mode is for. Private mode already changes how Firefox treats history, so it's not a problem for the user that regular mode and private mode might have different behaviors with respect to the back button. They already expect that it's different.   Specifically, if you don't think that idea is totally ridiculous, how do you recommend I bring my suggestion to the appropriate people?"
firefox,3csi9u,Osmose1000,2,Sat Jul 11 00:12:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sold on the idea, but it's not ridiculous, and may be worth suggesting. There's a few ways of making feature suggestions, with varying levels of usefulness:   https://input.mozilla.org/en-US/feedback - Input is the main place that explicitly is meant for feedback and suggestions from users, but it suffers from being flooded by so much data that there's a chance your suggestion won't get seen. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&component=Private%20Browsing - Filing a bug could go either way. Someone might come along and say ""Hey, we already have made our decision on this and we're not reconsidering."" and close out the bug. Or they might come along and say ""Hey, let's see if this is a good idea or not."" Find an appropriate mailing list - I was going to suggest the firefox-dev mailing list here, but according to its wiki page, it's not meant for feature suggestions, but I had trouble finding a more appropriate mailing list.   If I were you, I'd submit to Input, and if you hear nothing back within, say, a week, try filing a bug. If it gets closed out then the team is not interested in the idea, which is an unfortunate but normal part of dealing with open source projects. But hey: you care enough to want to suggest a change, which is awesome!"

firefox,3csi9u,youstolemyname,9,Fri Jul 10 13:06:10 2015 UTC,"Because the pages change frequently when people make comments.  If I click the ""full comments"" link from my user page, I want the full comments now, not as they were when I first opened the comments section.  But the back button has different semantics.

firefox,3csi9u,gnarly,3,Fri Jul 10 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"So, is it the case that HTTPS sites are not cached, regardless of whether they issue a  no-cache?  If so, then I agree that we shouldn't assume that HTTPS sites are particularly sensitive, because everything will start to move to HTTPS. So, HTTPS should not imply no-cache.  But I still think that a browser should honor the web standards if a page asks to not be cached. We have to assume that they know what they want. Users of the page should complain to the site if they believe it to be inappropriate."
firefox,3csi9u,IsThisTheRealLife,2,Fri Jul 10 16:08:44 2015 UTC,"So, is it the case that HTTPS sites are not cached, regardless of whether they issue a no-cache?   If I am reading the bug reports correctly, HTTP sites are kept in the bfcache (which is a full stateful DOM cache, not an http request cache) even if they issue a no-cache.  The back and forward buttons use the bfcache to restore a view of the page exactly as it was before, as recommended by RFC 2616 and allowed by RFC 7234.  HTTPS sites that send Cache-Control: no-cache are not kept in the bfcache, and so the back button does not go back to the page you were on before, but instead loads whatever the server returns for that URL now.  The behavior on HTTP pages with no-cache is exactly what you want for web forums and the like.  Clicking links always gives you the most recent version of a page, and the back button always gives you what was there before.  The way HTTPS no-cache works is not only slower, but also causes problems with semantics.  Say you're browsing an active web forum or /r/all.  You click on an interesting looking thread, spend 8 minutes reading it, and hit the back button.  Surprise, now the thread list is in a completely different order than what you saw before.  It also causes problems in Reddit commment threads.  The bfcache is the mechanism that preserves state when you hit the back button.  So without it, if you click a link posted in a Reddit comments page and then hit the back button, the changes made to the page by clicking ""load more comments"" are undone, and your scroll position is incorrect."
firefox,3csi9u,pogeymanz,5,Fri Jul 10 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, so it's not that Firefox is assuming no-cache for HTTPS sites. It's only a problem on sites that are both HTTPS and use no-cache.  I agree that this is a problem and was probably a decently practical compromise at the time of the original bug report, since few websites bothered to be HTTPS. These days, the solution they arrived at doesn't make as much sense."

I get that people are fallible and can't always be 100% secure, but should the browser do the incorrect thing to try to protect them?  Perhaps the current way Firefox does it should be a Private-browsing-only feature. I think that's the best compromise.

Once Firefox gets a stable and efficient single content process, work can go into better splitting content up into multiple processes (whether that's process-per-tab or process-per-window or process-per-domain, I dunno).

firefox,3cf3av,wildthing202,8,Tue Jul 7 15:41:23 2015 UTC,I couldn't deal with chrome becuse the interface is so strict and the configuration options are less then useful.  I think the real FU in chrome is digging though several layers of interface to find the proxy settings and then all it does is flip up the IE control panel.
firefox,3cf3av,Lurking_Grue,4,Tue Jul 7 19:47:18 2015 UTC,"This comment reads like a parody of users complaining about change.  Really, you've had to ""learn an entirely new user interface""? Firefox has changed so dramatically? I'm pretty sure it still has a back button, an address bar and tabs. But I bet doing that once a year gets pretty draining, though.  Wouldn't you prefer something that was actively being updated and iterated on that something that sits for years without change (IE, Safari)?"

firefox,3cf3av,Lurking_Grue,3,Tue Jul 7 19:49:39 2015 UTC,"Sure, it still has a refresh button. And a stop button. Unfortunately, it also removed the ability to move them outside of the address bar. And they're tiny. So that's a bummer.  It may not be a dramatic change, but it's certainly inconvenient. And a tad insulting when you read that their reasoning for making this change is because they consider users too stupid to be trusted with the ability to move buttons around."

firefox,3ch3kq,paulri,16,Tue Jul 7 21:52:41 2015 UTC,That was a specialized build of Firefox for the Modern UI interface. The normal Firefox Windows build (the one that's in an actual window) has always worked fine on Windows 8.

I didn't try it yet but I suspect you could just remove the blob from cisco and compile one for yourself.  brendan eich said in 2013:   you and others can verify the compiled bits come from that source, no malware or spyware added. We will organize community auditing of this sanity check, and the binary modules will be cryptographically signed so Firefox can verify their integrity.   and   But in the case of Firefox for Linux at least, and for Cisco’s OpenH264 binary modules, we can audit: get matching revision of the open source, compile with the same (bootstrapped from open source) clang or gcc toolchain, and compare bits.   So it seems to me that at least mozilla is keeping an eye on the binaries distributed by cisco. Of course if you're concerned, you should check it out yourself to be sure."

firefox,3cc5hv,alex-mayorga,6,Mon Jul 6 19:37:14 2015 UTC,I never use the new tab page. The only thing that might be useful to me might be the prefiltered history by sites in that page.  When I open a new tab I know what I an looking for and don't look for suggestions. I usually type in a search term directly in the address bar or the start of an address I have visited before and use the suggestions to complete it.

firefox,3cc5hv,SayNoToAdwareFirefox,4,Tue Jul 7 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"Let's get this out of the way: that first image is positively revolting.  Here it is in all its... glory.   Users have been able to delete sites since New Tab’s introduction; but it was never evident how to add a site of their own. After deleting an unwanted site, it should instead be super-easy to choose a new one.   This will be a very welcome addition.  I've been trying for several days now to get my Reddit user page frecent enough on FF Android that I can pin it.   By selecting “About this site” from the tile control menu, a user could perhaps see information regarding the site’s purpose, the interest it relates to, and the user’s most recent browsing history – all in one view.   Site specific history sounds like it might be fun.  We can already get at that information with a search in the history panel, but the example UI looks considerably better, particularly with the timestamps.  I don't think I would particularly care what ""interest it relates to"", however.   One day soon, users may be able to add feeds from their favorite destinations on the Web.   I wonder how this is planned to be implemented.  The PDF doesn't seem to say.  Will it periodically load and thumbnail the page?  That would be bandwidth heavy, but also great from a user privacy standpoint -- the site operator wouldn't be able to tell the difference from a user just loading the page.  Will it just subscribe to the relevant RSS feed?  Or will it be some kind of evil home-phoning monstrosity?  The scrollable new tab page from the linked PDF is a great idea.  However, a grid of tiles doesn't scale particularly well past a few items.  For all but the most frequently visited pages, page titles are more important than thumbnails or logos.  I think they should do it the same way FF Android does, where the new tab page is a tile grid at first and becomes a single column list sorted by frecency once you start scrolling.   Creators of outstanding content experiences would be rewarded. Content which fails to meet the standards of everyday users would be flagged and purged. The ecosystem could have a real incentive to make content truly better – just by harnessing real user feedback (for FREE!).   Eh...  Mass user feedback doesn't necessarily incentivize the greatest of content.  Just look at Reddit.  Plus, submitting a rating would mean giving information to ad goons.  Aid and comfort to the enemy, and all that.   Those looking for a certain, recently visited page could search via a simple dropdown, which would then list their most visited sites and corresponding browsing history.   Seems to me the URL bar already does that.  I don't have much to say about the other proposed changes, but I am mildly concerned about creeping featuritis and the impact of all these things on performance.  The new tab page has to load instantly.  Even on netbooks from 2009."

firefox,3ccufd,WitherSlick,14,Tue Jul 7 02:25:51 2015 UTC,"It was kind of hard to trust Google, with their rocky and two-faced stewardship of HTML5 video. First they made their own video codec, and got Mozilla to use it, promising to not require H264 on YouTube. Then they renegged on that promise, leaving it so that Mozilla had wasted all that time and were STILL back at square one, having to deal with the mess that was legally supporting H264.  So when these huge specs like Dash, MSE and EME were being worked-on, you can hardly blame Mozilla for being over-cautious and waiting until they were reasonably stable. Google forcing the issue isn't something to be happy about, especially since they've been paying Adobe to make their own custom Flash, causing Flash to only further deteriorate for those vendors who aren't paying for a custom build. They've played with rather shady tactics all along that have always put their browser and YouTube first, and left everyone else in the cold. Why do you think almost no video servers support MSE and Dash and such yet, aside from YouTube and affiliates who helped create them? Nobody trusts those standards yet. Google's stewardship hasn't encouraged adoption."
firefox,3ccufd,DrDichotomous,0,Tue Jul 7 03:09:14 2015 UTC,"Google's flash isn't a custom build it simply uses a different wrapper to the regular flash install. PPAPI vs NPAPI. Flash in Firefox sucks because of Adobe not Google. Google and Microsoft both chose to work on and adopt MSE and EME so there users could use Netflix without a plugin. This is also why YouTube works great in both Internet Explorer and Google Chrome.   Your post clearly has an agenda against Google leading you to make silly accusations that simply aren't even true.   Google could have handled the situation better but it's funny how quick support was implemented once Mozilla's hand was forced. Google, Microsoft and others had been working on these specs for ages and Mozilla chose not to participate because of their stance on DRM and now they're paying the price for it."
firefox,3ccufd,TwistyTrev,2,Tue Jul 7 12:04:31 2015 UTC,"Quick? It took Mozilla 8+ months to implement support.  I also fail to see how it's not a custom version of Flash? It's using a different API, and because Google was paying them to support it, Adobe stopped paying as much attention to the NPAPI custom version. Whether it's 99% the same is neither here nor there.  My ""agenda"" is simply to point out that Google aren't being good guys here, and that Mozilla had perfectly legit reasons to not want to jump on Google's spec before they did.  DRM support is neither here nor there when it comes to MSE and YouTube support. You still need a ""plugin"" for NetFlix+DRM support, it's just called a CDM now. Mozilla was never against MSE or Dash in that way, they just didn't want to invest resources in something so big when it wasn't stable, especially after their earlier experiences with Google's HTML 5 video steering."

New technology without optimization is useless. It uses more system resource. Now I'm just completely bypassing youtube videos playing in the browser. Desktop players can play them effectively and they only need the initial link of the video.  If I want to play a video in 720p in the browser, I have to wait for it to download fully (DASH is sooo useless), and then I can play it without any lag. HTML5 is the same, with more CPU usage when playing. Also, all webm videos are just lagging every 3-4 sec. So disappointing. :("

Pages that can be stored in the BFCache have their entire page state stored in memory, so Back and Forward can quickly restore the page without reloading the document. However, there are a number of restrictions on this - eg, https sites can't use it and there are other restrictions based on the content itself (eg, pages with an unload event handler will not use it).  This BFCache is distinct from the ""http cache"" - so all resources for a page may be in the http cache but not in the BFCache - in this case the document will still be reloaded, but using only cached resources."

What year is your MBP?   General Things: Test Firefox in safe mode, see if it's still slow.  Disable plugins that you don't use as well as extensions. If you're using Adblock plus switch to uBlock it uses less memory. Ghostery helps with not having to comply with all of the tracking systems sites use nowadays (optimizely, G analytics etc.)  NoScript helps load pages much faster and keeps you safe but can be annoying having to manually add sites to your white list.  I would suggest setting a cache limit in your preferences to something like 150 MB rather than the default 350.   I haven't heard of iBoostUp, but it might be running slow if iBoostUp is constantly clearing your browser cache. Cache is a double edged sword in a lot of senses because it will take up space on your computer yes, but will also help load sites dramatically faster because your cache saves frameworks that a lot of sites commonly use such as jquery, bootstrap, etc. If they aren't cached then you're going to have to load those large JS and CSS files on every page.

The idea is from a comment by b3master at this reddit post. You need to download an addon named Stylish. It's a ""user styles manager"". Than of course you need to download a CCS for it. There is one at the post I mentioned above but thats from Firefox 34 which is old a little bit. So I downloaded Firefox 39.0b7's source files and copied the theme's CSS files from there and uploaded them to pastebin. You will need 2 files: devedition.inc.css and devedition.css Then go to ""about:addons"" and ""User Styles"". Press the ""Write style"" button,name the style and just simply paste the stuff from devedition.inc and save it. Do the same with devedition.css. Activate both and there you have it. This solution is only temponarly and hopefully Mozilla adds back the Dev theme to Beta Firefox soon. Anyway I hope it helped. (Sorry if my English is bad :( )"

firefox,3bz0z4,Nayr747,-2,Fri Jul 3 14:29:29 2015 UTC,"I have done some speculation about this.  The keys to the ad-supported model's success, I think, are that it ties page views directly to revenue generation, and that the transaction cost is extremely low for the user -- lower than any traditional form of payment could be even if there were no processing fees at all, simply because of manual labor.  It would be prudent, therefore, for a replacement to have the same features.  One idea is this:    A service (say, uPay) allows users to anonymously create accounts, to which they can add money by credit card, cash, money order, bank transfer, bitcoin, and whatever else. Webmasters include a uPay single pixel image in their pages.  Receiving payment through uPay contractually obligates the webmaster not to subject their users to advertising. The user client (hypothetically, Firefox + an extension), upon detecting the uPay image, connects to uPay and, if the configured bid price is greater than the page's ask price, makes a micropayment. If payment fails, the client presents the user with the option to increase their bid price or navigate away from the page. The uPay service supplies a daemon on the web server with a running feed of payments, including the client IP address and page URL.  The daemon compares the web server's log with the payment data, and blacklists IP addresses that load more than X pages without payment. (Blacklisting could simply mean redirecting to a page on uPay's website explaining what was going on.)   For websites that expect the lion's share of their traffic to come from single-visits, the payment could be authenticated before actually returning the web page content.  Websites with user-generated content could charge users to post, instead of charging them to view.  I recognize that this business model wouldn't work for all websites.  Some sites could distribute their architecture to reduce hosting costs.  Imagine a federated Reddit-alike where subreddits operate their own servers, users donate VPSs, separate threads might be hosted on separate servers, and user page histories are only eventually consistent.  Sites with consistently high quality content, such as lwn.net, could use a subscription model.  Bloggers and the like who think their own ideas are good enough to be worth it could pay for their own hosting.  Many already do.  Of course, there will inevitably be some websites that simply would not be able to survive outside the advertising business model.  I have a suspicion, however, that most of these websites would have been kind of crappy anyway.  If adblock kills Gawker, Buzzfeed, and Gizmodo, I say good riddance."

However, that sounds like a massive infrastructure change for the industry as a whole, and I doubt it would go anywhere in quite a few years. In the mean time I'd like to see some gradual improvements and in the field. That's what these recent new tab controversies and whatnot as well as Darren Herman's post look like to me.

That advertising is a legacy industry that's being blown out by other types.  Netflix for example has no advertising and it is doing well.  Netflix has 61.4 million monthly subscribers worldwide.  Multiply that by the $9.00 a month.  That's $6.63 billion a year.  That makes it larger than most of the popular broadcasters combined.  If your content is a web page and you expect advertising to pay the bills you are operating in a legacy model and you are going to die as an entity.  Find another way to make your site work.

That doesn't mean the changed made in the latest version aren't any important - that just means they aren't revolutionary enough to guarantee a whole number jump.  For example, the jump from 3.6.x to 4.0 was justified because it featured a brand new UI, one that actually improved customizability (by enabling modification of the bottom bar). The next jump - from 4 to 5 though, was stupid because there wasn't anything noticeably new (stability and performance are matters of course for most users and they usually won't notice if something like that changes), and it should have continued with 4.1 instead.  But my little friend in the other comment thread is right - it is kinda fruitless today to complain about a change that happened years ago, even if it was as stupid as it was.

After that, make a new XML file following that pattern and restart Firefox, then you'll have a new custom search engine; if you don't know what the things like ""suggestions url"" are for your engine, don't try to put them in, but be sure to have the main search URL, the one with type text/html, in there.

You can also go straight to your DNS settings with one click.  If I remember correctly, it took me awhile (been using it for years now) to be comfortable with it (like any new software), but now it sits on my taskbar and is used daily.  OpenDNS and GoogleDNS are usually the two fastest (as mentioned by bull500), but if your DNS is leaking (https://www.dnsleaktest.com/), and you are worried about privacy, I would opt for OpenDNS, or change your DNS often.

firefox,3brsxq,smartfon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:38:45 2015 UTC,"It's hard to write rules for uMatrix. In uBlock, besides adding hosts files, you also have filters that allow a particular domain to load but block specific parts of it. I think uBlock has an advantage in that area. You might be able to replace uBlock if you block absolutely everything with uMatrix, but from my own experience, it breaks websites so much that at some point I start to completely disable uMatrix on a pages to see if that's what's causing an issue. Then of course the site loads all the ads and trackers when I do that. uBlock is nice because you know that 99.99% of the time you don't have to disable it temporarily to troubleshoot something. Technically, you don't have to disable uMatrix entirely, you can just manually allow scripts one by one and reload the page every time you make a change until the site works, but over time it becomes a pain and takes too much time if you block everything by default.  At the moment, I don't even consider getting rid of uBlock simply because of its feature that allows you to visually select and block any object on a page."

It's easier if you're only using it on a LAN with static internal IPs, otherwise, if you don't have a static public IP, you'll need some sort of Dynamic DNS setup.  Have the netbook pull the profile folder from your desktop: rsync --exclude lock -a --delete desktopuname@desktop:/home/desktopuname/.mozilla/firefox/profilefolder /home/uname/.mozilla/firefox/  If you want it to be automatic, put that in a shell script, set up a systemd service and timer for it in /etc/systemd/system:  /home/uname/firefoxsync.sh  #!/bin/sh rsync --exclude lock -a --delete desktopuname@desktop:/home/desktopuname/.mozilla/firefox/profilefolder /home/uname/.mozilla/firefox/   /etc/systemd/system/firefoxsync.service  [Unit] Description=Firefox Sync  [Service] Type=simple ExecStart=/home/uname/firefoxsync.sh User=uname   /etc/systemd/system/firefoxsync.timer (with daily sync)  [Unit] Description=Scheduler for Firefox Sync  [Timer] OnCalendar=daily  [Install] WantedBy=timers.target   Something like that would work, anyway.

I mean, I could probably set up an rsync solution for myself in about ten minutes, but there's obviously a barrier to entry there.  To answer some of the questions you asked in a different comment:   I wonder how much the cloud synced folder would affect performance?   It wouldn't affect performance unless it was a network drive. It'd sync to a local copy.   Perhaps I could use my Spideroak account for this   If it allows you to sync folders in the same way that Dropbox does, it'll probably work.    That said, if you do want to roll your own solution. I can provide additional assistance.   Just in case you're curious, I'll add some more info:  SSH is actually relatively simple to set up. The wiki page does look daunting, I'll give you that.  Generate a keypair (enter for all options): ssh-keygen Copy the public key (id_rsa.pub) to the remote host and place it in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. Alter the ssh config on the remote host (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) to disable root login and password authentication. Example Config. Ensure sshd is running on the remote host: sudo systemctl start sshd  For it to work either way, you'd repeat the steps on the remote host.  As for hosting providers, the one you provided seems to be a survey scam. DigitalOcean is the best one I've found (and the cheapest).

There is Vivaldi [Screenshot], a browser made by the former CEO of Opera and his team. It strives to recreate the original Opera 12 set of features, like RSS reader, sidebars, tab grouping, etc..., while building the entire browser on top of Chromium/Blink engine. It's a nice try, but it still feels more like Chrome than Opera, and I fear it always will. There is also Otter Browser [Screenshot], which looks far more promising in terms of customization (very impressive options, but as a whole the browser is far from ready for everyday use. I have high hopes for this one, though. Then there is Maxthon. It bundles a lot of interesting features alright, but given it is developed in China I'm kinda leery of trusting it with my internet life. SeaMonkey may also be a good choice for a power user. It's basically what Firefox (Mozilla Suite) used to be almost a decade ago, and it looks that way. It's a browser, mail client, and a chat client in one application. And it's even more or less officially supported by Mozilla, as SeaMonkey bugs are accepted on Bugzilla as well. Pale Moon is what I currently use. It's based on Firefox 24 user interface (so no Australis is happening here), and the author claims to backport most security updates from the actual Firefox. However, the author wants it known that Pale Moon is not Firefox, not anymore, and over time it will be more and more true. Currently, they want to fork Gecko engine into ""Goanna"", to gain ""freedom to continue to develop in (their) own direction"".

firefox,3bl3dw,rsnn,7,Tue Jun 30 18:42:59 2015 UTC,"Given all the recent shenanigans, a bad light has been cast on the actions of uBlock's interim maintainer. It would seem that most of chrisaljoudi's effort has been (mis)placed in soliciting donations and in purporting the image that he is the creator and main developer of uBlock.  To chrisaljoudi, I ask - do donations really mean so much that you would willingly sacrifice your integrity to gain a few?  And to gorhill, I ask - can differences be set aside so that uBlock can grow to become the dominant adblocker? Yes, I know it is not simply an adblocker.  The fallout from the split in the development team after April 1 has costed the loss of Deathamns, the developer who singlehandedly ported uBlock to Firefox and Safari, has slowed the growth of uBlock, and has also divided the addon's community.  What would be ideal, in my opinion, is that:   Control of uBlock be returned to gorhill. chrisaljoudi be made the official maintainer of the Safari version. Community members help moderate the issues raised so that developers can spend their time on worthwhile issues. This has already been achieved judging by the issue trackers. Reunite uBlock and uBlock Origin. With all the competition from the countless adblockers today, uBlock cannot be split if its goal is to usurp the current king - the mafia-like Adblock Plus."

firefox,3bl3dw,IsThisTheRealLife,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:20:40 2015 UTC,"Gorhill's uBlock Origin has more advanced features like the dynamic blocking of elements. uBlock Origin should technically get the latest updates faster. AFAIK GorHill was the main developer of the addon.  Since the drama is starting again, we don't want people to create new posts on /r/firefox everyday to ask what's going on, so here is a little background for thsoe who are unaware:  The problem begun when the creators of the ad filters(AdBlockPlus and FanBoy?) had some filters that were causing some legitimate sites not to load. uBlock uses those filters so uBlock users had issues too. Most bug reports and problems on uBlock's GitHub page were about this type issue, rather than what Gorhill and uBlock team were actually working on. Gorhill got tired of having to deal with something he has no control of and decided to leave the maintainship of the project to others, while he created his own fresh page and renamed his copy to uBlock0 (origin) and started working only on uBlock Origin related features and bugfixes. Then I think Chris, one of the contributors but relatively small one, created a website to promote uBlock and wrote that it was created/brought by him. he was also asking for donations. I believe that is when the drama started. Gorhill wanted Chris to credit the whole teamand not to turn the project into a cash machine. The public opinion shifted against Christ so he had to make a YouTube video explaining the situation and that he didn't mean to hijack the project and he only needed enough money to pay for hosting servers and stuff like that. It appeared that things calmed down after Chris changed the wording and gave credit to others too. Now the same drama is happening again because Chris ported the project for iOS and apparently his name is listed as the creator. Gorhill obviously complained about it. I think this is the first of a kind ad blocker for iOS so Chris is going to get millions of users. That makes things more ""dramatic""."
firefox,3bl3dw,fang5566,3,Tue Jun 30 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"There's not much Gorhill can do about attribution because he chose to release under GPLv3 which only requires a bare minimum of attribution, typically just a copyright notice on source files."

firefox,3blwmt,caspy7,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:43:45 2015 UTC,"One way to test if this is caused  by some  rogue addon would be to get full profile and addon backup, easiest way to do it would be to use FEBE https://addons.mozilla.org/fi/firefox/addon/febe/  Then get a hold some linux live cd usb stick  and restore those addons to that Firefox on that live cd. This may seem like a lot just for  a test out if your Firefox profile is ok or not,  or if there is some bad addon in there.   I wouldn't recommended this if i haven't bee on that very  same situation myself,  first i was thinking that at if it was some virus or malware. but soon as i restored my addons to my live cd ubuntu it also started to show some annoying adds, then i started to suspect that maybe there where some bad addons on that backup.   So take backup from your Firefox addons and profile and start to experiment on ""safe""  live cd or virtual machine install,  if there is a virus that could jump from host system (windows)  to some live cd linux and start to attack on the live cd Firefox,  then that virus coder has make so good jop that i can mail him/her  my banking information...   So these steps wouldn't remove that add problem from your main Firefox profile but at least you could be sure that if live cd Firefox shows those adds too then it is your addon/s or profile,  but if you can surf web just fine on live cd with all your addons and other personal settings intact then your windows install is infected."

But seriously, why does Mozilla want everything to be an addon, but then turn around and incorporate Pocket and Hello into the browser itself?  If all you want to do is prevent hijacking, by all means, force a pop up that says the new tab page has been changed when you start up the browser (and it had been changed) and pull up some GUI to let the user modify the page if they don't like what they have."
firefox,3be0c6,Exaskryz,39,Sun Jun 28 11:09:57 2015 UTC,"They're still here. I was as shocked as you when I first heard about this, but after reading the bug (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1118285) I think it makes sense. An enormous proportion of poor experiences with Firefox are caused by search hijacking, of which this preference is a major contributor. Firefox can't block-list random pref changes. The other alternative of alerting to a change in new tab page obviously doesn't work, because despite the existence of this page for side-loaded addons, these addons are still regularly installed. Users obviously pay little attention to these pages, if the malware hasn't already figured out a way to avoid showing it.  On the other hand, they did not remove this outright and instead put in place an addon API, which allows new tab addons to function as usual, and also enables this functionality to be recreated there. As signed addons are coming, this means that they will be able to significantly decrease the number of search hijackings, as addons won't be installed if they are not signed and checked for malware. The only people who lose out here are those who set the custom about:config setting to a URL (these prefs are specifically not guaranteed to be stable). The good news is that for those affected, a simple, small addon is already available which allows users to set this to whatever they please: (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/).  I know this still runs against the charges of replacing necessary 'features' with 'bloat'. For the record I don't agree with the Pocket decision, but to call Firefox Hello bloat or, even the misguided Pocket campaign for that matter, eschews either ignorance or disingenuous arguments. It has been repeatedly shown that Pocket integration is merely a few lazily-loaded API calls to a HTML webpage, while Hello is essentially a small, lazily-loaded UI on a web standard feature with Firefox Account integration. The fact that these are lazily-loaded features is key here, and means that they will contribute such a negligible amount to memory usage when not in use that any increase would likely fall within noise measurements on a system. Moreover, the removed 'feature' is an advanced, hidden preference used by a few advanced users who can easily replicate this functionality, and whose existence negatively affected exponentially greater numbers of less advanced users, who often have problems doing even basic troubleshooting.  Whether 'bloat' is an appropriate term notwithstanding, Firefox Hello is a fantastic feature which uses open, web standard APIs to challenge the entrenched proprietary systems currently dominating the market. This is exactly in line with the mission of the Mozilla Foundation, i.e. to break open proprietary duopolies with open web standards."

People were taught to tick everything and click ok by early windows installer. That damn warning page let's you do exactly that for addons.  If the most clearly visible button was removing them, most users who don't know what they're doing would remove the addons and more advanced users would look for a way to keep those they want.    If you name the addon 'Microsoft Windows Fixer' or 'KAPOW!

firefox,3be0c6,bh35,0,Sun Jun 28 14:19:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the first point, the side-loaded addon page could certainly be better designed, but as below I think a significant proportion do read popups and consciously click yes if the name is something to do with 'security','updates' or 'fixing'. This also doesn't address potential bypasses of this screen, is extremely complex code-maintenance-wise and probably occurs a performance penalty on boot, due to the need to check a preference at startup.   Regarding your second point, how can they make a reasonable decision if they are unable to see the result of their change? The whole point of a popup is to give users the information they need to make a simple decision, while minimising the user confusion which arises from a multi-step process. I still think many people are oblivious to how software interactions on their computers work and would be anxious about how this affects their computer. I know many people who just click yes on most popups to 'protect their computer', particularly if it has those buzzwords I listed above.   I don't understand why it is unreasonable to completely remove this massive avenue of exploitation at the expense of an extraordinarily small, technologically literate minority (relying on a preference that is specifically not guaranteed to be stable) who can easily replicate this functionality with a small addon. We are talking less than 0.01% of the user base here, to fix something which is the bane of many, many average users. To me, these complaints remind me of https://xkcd.com/1172/."

I assumed that if someone changed the prefs they remember doing it.  As for power users and extensions - sure you can bring back most of the things mozilla removes. But if this continues there will be nothing separating Firefox from Opera and Chrome in which you can also add features via addons. What is more Chrome addons seem to be much more actively developed so there's less risk of the extensions running out of support and becoming unavailable."
firefox,3be0c6,bh35,0,Sun Jun 28 15:06:49 2015 UTC,"The prefs can be changed with extensions, not just a direct edit. It might not be obvious to the user which addon is changing such functionality and for what reason.   There are many things separating Firefox from both Opera and Google even if the browsers were identical. Mozilla is the only non-profit foundation running an open-source browser without intense shareholder pressure to monetise its users to the nth degree. Anytime Mozilla has ever monetised its users, it has offered users an option to opt-out or use alternative services. The open source nature of the project is also extremely important, as it allows auditing of what Mozilla is doing.  That said, there are things that Firefox can do that Chrome will never be able to do, particularly with theming, advanced blocking, security and privacy, userscripts, userstyles and customization (CTR, status-4-evar). Unless Mozilla creates a brand-new browser, it is unlikely that the depth of this customization will ever be lost, particularly by the removal of one small about:config entry, which was replaced by an extension hook."

The security paradigm on current desktop OSes makes attempting to protect against local malware a fool's game.  To prevent this kind of attack, you need to prevent programs from modifying each other's binaries, reading or modifying each other's user data, or modifying whatever configuration controls how available applications are presented to the user.  The only thing signed addons will protect against is web pages that socially engineer users into accepting addon installations, for addons that would not pass review in the curated addons.mozilla.org.  And the cost we must pay is giving up our ability to install locally built addons, and addons that do not pass review in the curated addons.mozilla.org, and addons whose authors are unable or unwilling to go through the hassle of getting their addon reviewed.  Apple has recently demonstrated why walled gardens are dangerous.  And given Mozilla recent tendency to write their own adware into stock Firefox, I wouldn't trust them to curate anything anyway.   Mozilla put ads on the new tab page that: a) are displaced by user history   False.  That was the old ads.  The new ads are selected based on user history and will not be displaced.   b) are easily disabled with a quick and visible drop down menu on the very page on which they are displayed   You think users are smart enough to know they need to look for that drop down menu, find it, and disable the ads, but you also think they're too dumb to click no instead of yes when an untrustworthy page tries to install a Firefox addon?   c) respect the users privacy   Irrelevant.

We had similar findings in our own user testing.  If users can be so confused as to think that they don't use the internet but use Facebook, then it's not hard to imagine them understanding how to use a browser without knowing why their newtab page changed, let alone even knowing what the newtab page is.

It's how they use the browser so after telling them that the searchbar is already there a couple of times I gave up.   That's why I'm all for treating users as very naive people - I'd like to see the new addon alert redesigned to make it more scary and make it disable the new plugins by default even when ticked. And that's why I proposed the browser.newtab.url change warning which would restore the defaults unless the user consciously chooses otherwise. Basically if they can choose wrong unknowingly, let the most obvious choice be restoring the defaults and warning people about the threads.  But at the same time I would like to keep as many toggles and prefs as possible in the browser. If someone knows what they are doing, let them do it.

And that's why I proposed the browser.newtab.url change warning which would restore the defaults unless the user consciously chooses otherwise.   That's a valid proposal, and it's not a bad idea. I think the idea with the way it was done was that we can leverage the add-on signing feature as a stronger way of keeping malicious actors from changing this value than a warning, although it's not perfect because, as you said, if their entire system is already infected, it can be bypassed.  If we assume that users who ""know what they're doing"" are able to install add-ons, then they still have the option of installing the add-on linked elsewhere that lets you change the page. That's the key to understanding why this decision was made, I think, because it basically means that, from Firefox's standpoint, moving the newtab URL to be add-on-configurable only does not significantly impede expert users' ability to change it.  That may turn out to be false, or maybe moving the value won't be as big of a hurdle as we think, but honestly, how can we know without trying? If it doesn't work out then maybe it'll move back to about:config. It's really hard to innovate without room to try new things."

The biggest problem here is not that the newtab url can be changed by software, even the homepages have been target of this problem for years, the biggest problem is the fact that Firefox does not provide an easy method to change the new tab url as it does for the Home page, which is what is being exploited the most.  Homepages are also a target of these changes, but they aren't considering removing the ability to customize it like they are with the new tab url, so why not make the new tab page be as easy to change as the homepage seeing that it seems like a valid reason to keep customization for the homepage?  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1118285#c60   I'd like to propose an even simpler solution: allow new tab url to be changed the way the homepage can be currently changed.  The biggest issue here is not that software can modify the new tab pages, it's the fact that there is no easy method to change it via user input. Even amateur users can go to the Firefox settings and change their homepage to whatever they want, but if they want to change the new tab url they have absolutely no setting for this in the options UI, it is instead hidden in the about:config list.  Allow new tab urls to be changed the same way the homepage can be, also include that setting right next to it as well for easier access.     ::Original comment below before the edit added above::  This is problematic and a very drastic approach to an issue that should no longer exist with the forced add-on signing system coming up in the near future. I've wrote the following hoping that they will listen and not move forward with this anymore, or at least not so drastically:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1118285#c59   This change is completely useless since Mozilla will be enforcing add-on signing in the future which will prevent this vulnerability and allow a safe user customization. It also negatively impacts the overall user experience and customization since it will now force users to install a third party software only to achieve the same result, which will make them depend on a developer to keep the add-on updated and it will also impact performance negatively (having it as a native setting vs add-on controlled will always be faster and lighter).  At worst allow these two alternative options: Set new tab pages to blank and set new tab pages to homepage."
firefox,3be0c6,It_Was_The_Other_Guy,8,Sun Jun 28 13:01:40 2015 UTC,"I don't see what this has to do with add-on signing. The pref can be changed without any extensions since they are stored in plain-text file. If anything, this works better with extension signing since malware can't install an extension that changes the newtab page.  And you can already blank the newtab-page if you want. No need to get to about:config or anything.  IMO, if you are advanced enough user to even think about changing the newtab page to something custom, it shouldn't be too hard to find or install an extension to do so."
firefox,3be0c6,Yonez,-1,Sun Jun 28 13:35:46 2015 UTC,"I don't see what this has to do with add-on signing   The main cases where this setting has been changed (in my experience) has been via software that installs itself in Firefox and then changes the tab url, in some cases after making the modifications some uninstall themselves as to leave almost no traces of its presence.  Allowing only approved add-ons will filter any add-on that has this kind of invasive behavior, thus preventing the issue at hand.  If the case being made is that it still can be changed via a file, then the same concerns can be shared across every other setting present in there and as such the same approach should be taken and remove all of the options to prevent unwanted modifications, although by now it is very obvious how impractical this would be. These specific important settings should instead become native/part of the Firefox library instead of in a text file vulnerable to other software.  If a user is advanced enough, like you pointed, then he won't be willing to negatively impact its browser performance just to restore a simple native setting and become dependent on a developer to achieve this result, which might discontinue the add-on, include bloatware, etc. Case in point, I am such advanced user and I really do not want an add-on just to restore this feature.  This change is only being favored by the users that either a) don't make use of it and b) only use the blank page, everyone else is being completely ignored and this is not correct.  EDIT: I've added an edit note to my original reply which addresses this issue even better, in my opinion."
firefox,3be0c6,It_Was_The_Other_Guy,2,Sun Jun 28 13:57:41 2015 UTC,I kinda like that solution. Maybe take it a bit further though.  Create UI to options to control new-tab page but only whitelisted pages are allowed by default. Such as chrome:// and about: uri's and possibly pre-installed search engine pages.  How's that?
firefox,3be0c6,DrDichotomous,2,Sun Jun 28 17:43:07 2015 UTC,"Then the addon will just change the whitelist. And if you make it tougher to change the whitelist, then only malicious addons will do so.  This isn't something with an easy fix, though I'm not saying Mozilla's is any better. After all, addons will still be able to change the new tab page quite easily even without an about:config option.  Honestly it seems like Mozilla is trying to fix the situation, but they aren't being very clear on their roadmap to get from point A to point B (if they even have a surefire plan). There are tickets about revamping the security model for addons and so forth, but it's hard to get a bigger picture, and the baby steps we're seeing seem useless without a bigger picture available."
firefox,3be0c6,It_Was_The_Other_Guy,2,Sun Jun 28 17:55:56 2015 UTC,"I would agree, but if extensions need to be signed and distributed via AMO then I see no issue here.  But you are right, it would be nice to have some roadmap of the larger scale changes that might be planned."
firefox,3be0c6,DrDichotomous,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:01:22 2015 UTC,"The problem is that addon signing itself doesn't mean that the code will be necessarily vetted for malicious behavior, since it doesn't mean a full review (and addons won't have to be distributed via AMO, just signed). It does mean that the signing can be revoked pretty quickly at least, limiting the damage and (hopefully) making it more easy to detect and block repeat offenders, but it may not be.

firefox,3be0c6,Yonez,-1,Sun Jun 28 21:39:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know how a whitelist could be made to please all the users, it would still restrict them, what if the user is trying to test its own page focused on new tabs, which isn't present in the whitelist?  But this is debatable, however, whichever the case would be, the user could always change the new tab page as easy as changing the homepage, and that is  something that should have been implemented ever since the browser started allowing custom pages for new pages.  Simply completely removing the option should have never been considered in the first place; the concern is valid, the solution is absolutely not. It is lazy (no offense intended to whom it may concern) and is depleting yet another point which uses to be in favor of Firefox vs Chrome: limitless customization. It starts with this option, next they will remove the ability to skin the browser, rearrange toolbar buttons, etc. next thing we know and we have a Chrome copy.

It's no surprise that this very demographic probably has a dozen plus addons, too.

Do these people really think the code required to re-enable such a feature will be such a suck on resources that it would be better for it to be built-in? Fuck no. It's a toggle. Whatever code was disabled/removed in the browser, just found it's way into the addon. Shit man, it's probably a single file addon that just tells the browser to toggle the built-in browser switch that was just toggled off by default now. They actually think it will bog their browser down. FFS. Guaranteed the code is till built right into the browser, with a simple boolean that says ""on by default or off by default"" and the addon is just that extra step to enable it now, to prevent the large majority of dumbasses from cutting their fingers off.

firefox,3be0c6,bh35,-6,Sun Jun 28 17:42:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked at the code, but if I know anything about software development, this does not look like a complex feature that would require something to be removed. It's probably so minor, the only thing they did was prevent it from being on by default, and prevent it from being toggle-able by default. It suddenly went from something public, to something protected, which in all likelihood has kept every line of code intact, with the exception that the default method handling this now says, ""don't respect the URL string defined here anymore by default,"" and because the browser interface has removed the option to enable it, it's more difficult to enable--not just for de facto idiots, but for malware. I am almost certain the addon just some XML-like config that says ""enable that hidden config."" And if this wasn't clear to anyone: that will have zero impact on browser performance. I mean, what do most people think? If code is removed from the browser, suddenly it will quadruple because it's in an addon? Fuck no. If code was actually removed, the browser just got lighter; if code was disabled or hidden from user tampering, the browser has stayed the same. Throw a fit, people, amiright? Burn the bridges, rape the women, because OH NO the browser has made a fucking change for the best. Go wave your fucking confederate flags you inveterate morons."

Everyone knows that more addons means slower browsing experience, at least until November 4th. It's another thing whether this particular addon itself will be a hog or not. People don't like to see a handy feature gone and replaced by yet another addon. Those who are on this subreddit are probably savvy enough to take care of bad addons that hijack New Tab page and they'd rather not see this change. They don't need a ""babysitter"" for that, that's why most reactions you see on this thread are negative. THis change will benefit the vast majority uf Firefox users, however. I've seen some really cool customizations on New Tab page on this sub and obviously people who spent time on it will be mad. My initial response was negative too, but luckily I already have an addon that I can use to fix the issue without having to install yet another addon."

firefox,3bfv8t,Doccks71,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:44:48 2015 UTC,"The first one that I came across is the recommendation to uncheck ""don't load tabs until selected"": Even if you have a fast connection, you can start working with the browser faster if it doesn't need to load every single tab from your session first; this is probably the best innovation in Firefox, and for now I use The Great Suspender in Chrome to approximate that functionality.  EDIT: In the very next paragraph, it recommends keeping that option on if you also have Firefox start with your previous session.    I also noticed that it recommended disabling prefetching as a ""speed setting""; while prefetching is a potential privacy risk (which is why uBlock Origin disables it by default) and does use more RAM, it actually boosts effective browsing speed except in the rare case where you click links in rapid succession.    Setting browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll to true replicates an annoying behavior in Chrome: Usually I want to start editing just part of a URL in the address bar, and I need to click twice (once to select the whole URL, then once inside the selection to get the cursor where I want it and start the real selection).  Also, it's a security risk to turn off URL formatting, which shows which part of the URL is the actual domain you're visiting.    YMMV on allowing windows with no tabs; I remember the Firefox UI just before Australis didn't work well with that, but it might work well in Australis. Similarly, YMMV on disabling any and all popup windows, which I believe some Web apps specifically require to work.    Making related tabs open at the end rather than next to the tab from which they came is a bad idea.    Finally, although the current version of that guide rightly recommends uBlock or uBlock Origin, if you do still use Adblock Plus, I recommend the following two preferences, listed in the format in which you could paste them into prefs.js (when your browser is closed).  user_pref(""extensions.adblockplus.sidebar_key"", ""Accel Shift U, Accel Shift Y, Accel Shift Z""); user_pref(""extensions.adblockplus.subscriptions_exceptionscheckbox"", false);   (Equivalently, you can create those two prefs in about:config if they don't exist already, making the first a string and the second a boolean, and set them to the values I listed.)  The first one keeps ABP from overriding the ""paste as plain-text"" feature in many CMSes and webmail applications, like GMail and Hotmail; the second allows a better view into that Acceptable Ads whitelist, whether you enable it or (recommended) not."

firefox,3b8aqi,smartfon,5,Fri Jun 26 23:23:45 2015 UTC,"Google Safe Browsing   Firefox make an initial connection to Google and downloads the list of known bad website URL hashes, AFAIK. When you visit a site, your visited site's hash is compared to the local copy of the hashes that you already have. The URL is not sent to Google servers for analysis. The Safe Browsing feature does not transmit every single website that you visit. If you visit a site that matches a malicious hash then that particular URL is sent to Google. They can only see the malicious sites that you visit, which is not really a privacy violation because it's something that happens rarely. If you're really worried about visited URLs then you might as well stop using an antivirus product becuase they can see every site you visit (unless you use Emsisoft, which does not transmit this info).  However, I recall reading a section on Google privacy policy page where it describes that the Google Chrome browser can scan a content on the page and make a decision whether the site is suspicious or not (without relying on Google Safe Browsing hashes), and transmit the URL to Google for examination.  AFAIK this only applies to Chrome and not to Firefox. That particular feature could be bad for privacy because Google doesn't tell you what exactly is considered a ""suspicious"" thing so they could end up sending most of the visited URLs back to Google.   Firefox stats collecting and health reports   Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Firefox remove the personal information before sending it to Mozilla? I think crash reports are the ones that could contain a private info, no?   Encrypted Media Extensions (DRM)   There is no ""data leak"" here, but I think a site that uses this feature could track a returning visitor. Isn't this actually what a DRM supposed to do? The way Firefox implemented it does not allow user tracking across the internet. Content provider can NOT have the visitor's unique device fingerprint. The device ID is tied to something else that can be removed and reset to another ID. Websites can not see IDs set by other websites."

Want the most optimized and up to date nightly builds with Intel+AVX2 extensions and all that jazz enabled? Use fbuilds. Want something that works on OS X? I don't understand how a tiny projcet such as Pale Moon/waterfox/[insert stupid fork name here] thinks that they can ""do it better"" than a large corporation such as Mozilla. To me it just seems like they're adding some special build flags, modifying a bit of the source, and slapping new branding on an outdated and, in my opinion, weaker distribution of Mozilla's firefox. They're primarily going to be merging from Firefox's latest comm-central branch anyway. It's an unnecessary solution to a non-existent problem.   I've (personally) recently found that all of my troubles have been solved by migrating to SeaMonkey. All of the extensions that I need actually work (even all of those that claim incompatibility can simply be fixed by modifying the install.rdf to allow installation). There is a consistent, retro-oriented UI that I find more functional than anything Mozilla has produced in the past ~10 years, and can run pretty much any extension due to the absence of constant UI and engine changes. There is a sense of familiarity for those who have been around the web-browser for a long period of time. Nightly builds of SeaMonkey have incorporated all of the latest speed and stability improvements, without all of the ridiculous pocket/hello/etc. integration that Firefox has seen recently. I write this with little familiarity of the Pale Moon project, granted, but if someone would like to refute these points I'm all ears.  Edit: fixed spelling near the end of the first paragraph"
firefox,3ay037,Jethric,4,Wed Jun 24 16:19:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. To cap it all off, you don't even need to use ESR unless frequency of updates bothers you. You can just use either the Dev edition or the CTR/Status-4-evar addons to get firefox into its pre-australis state. You can use settings to revert the search experience even.   As far as I can tell, all they are doing is lagging behind in updates on speed, security and stability. Many of the updates to Firefox's security are quite invasive. I doubt they are going to go e10s and that is going to make sandboxing impossible. Ergo, a less secure browser. Their small hardcore fanbase cannot keep up with a 300 million dollar foundation and billion dollar corporations that drive the web."
firefox,3ay037,xelaseer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:34:03 2015 UTC,"Well it might just be that some old features (pre-australis) features cannot be achieved with extensions anymore and (is ESR still on pre-australis UI?), so I'll give them that much.   The ""performance"" builds in general are kinda meh in my opinion and I have not noticed any kind of speedup in those which I've tried. But I guess if that makes someone feel special and they are happy with it, then who am I to judge.  Personally I've not tried SeaMonkey but I kinda feel like I wouldn't like integrated email client and such. But it's definitely a great option for someone."
firefox,3ay037,It_Was_The_Other_Guy,3,Wed Jun 24 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"I usually switch between Firefox (with CTR) and SeaMonkey. SeaMonkey by default has a good UI but a somewhat-worse-than-Firefox UX, which can be fixed with add-ons, whom make it better than stock Firefox. You're probably going to want the following add-ons: Focus Last Selected Tab (restores Firefox and Chrome-like tab closing behavior), SeaTab-X-2 (Close buttons on the tabs), and Orthodox (Restores the classic Netscape 4/6 theme if you want it). Some add-ons like Greasemonkey and RES don't work by default but there are custom versions that do. (Greasemonkey (Sorry for the sourceforge), RES) For other add-ons, like AdBlock Plus, the Firefox versions work as intended. (I don't think there is a uBlock port yet) As for mail/news/IRC, it hides in your Status Bar and doesn't affect anything until you start them for the first time, I use SM all the time on about 5 PCs, and I think I've used mail once, and it hasn't bothered me anywhere else. The great thing about SM though is how little the UI changes (AKA: no Pocket, Australis or Hello), while at the same time you experience the benefits of a modern HTML5 compliant browser."

In your case I'd suggest for you to disable SPF since it will make YouTube load every page as if it was opened for the first time, thus avoiding having to reload whenever you need, that is if you see this as a viable option until the issue is identified and fixed.  Also if you are using the add-on version do check for new updates on the add-on page directly because since they haven't approved my add-on yet the auto-update feature is off, which means that you could be using a version that is outdated without knowing. As of now the latest version is 0.2.6"

EDIT: It seems that my problem was just bad internet connection that would happen when I'd load YouTube. Yesterday I had that issue happen to me at least 5 times when it usually happens 1 time per 2 or 3 days. So it's safe to say that an intermittent internet connection at a given time can influence SPF while loading a video and force you to reload the page to see the actual video.

Even Google and Microsoft allow people to discuss their videos.  Its really sad to see the current development of Firefox and Mozilla. If I just wanted an open source browser I would choose Chromium, its in the repos of all major distros and at least Google is focussing on technical excellence rather than on third-party gimmicks. However, I choose Firefox because of its customizability and, much more important, their philosophy. Sadly it seems that this philosophy is being diluted more and more.

Using Firefox to like photos on Facebook does not mean you are technically adept, or eligible to make commonplace generalities about the technical state of the browser. Repeating what everyone else already knows about the unfortunate gimmicks hardly qualifies your opinion about the technical underpinnings of the browser.

Edit: yep, when it's a feature you like, like Polaris/Tracking Protection, then you curiously don't mind if it's bundled with Firefox and opt-in, just like Pocket is.

firefox,3apqcn,UGoBoom,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:10:59 2015 UTC,"Oh no it's definitely not just you. I found this searching for just that. The only thing that keeps me around at this point is that it has better extension support. For example Chrome locks down its extensions so strictly some of the ones I like (such as image gallery download to folders generated based on artist name) are said to be impossible to create on Chrome due to its extreme file system restrictions.  The point at which my attitude about Firefox went into the negative territory is when they removed the option to disable image loading.  The response? An arrogant ""we want the UI clean and we don't see a reason for it"" reply that completely ignored the user's feedback and displayed the trend of what I call ""arrogant UI designer syndrome.""  You see this big time with YouTube, iTunes, and of course with the Windows 8 release.  You get these big shot UI designers that decide what works best, and they surround themselves with adoring fans that reinforce their egos.  They will make radical or arbitrary changes and the user just has to live with it, because ""Mr./Ms. Professional UI Designer"" knows best.  The devices list in iTunes going away, the obvious option to disable image loading in Firefox going away (there are many reasons for this to be an option but it's beyond the scope of this rant), and YouTube's psychotic UI revisions (not to mention the war on privacy that is Google+) are all examples of this.  I long for the days when UI customization was a good thing, and thankfully Firefox hasn't gotten rid of that (yet).  Firefox also retains context-based menus too. I think a huge blight of modern UI design is the outright omission of menus.  Sure, scatter stupid buttons all over the screen if it's efficient to use them, but with hierarchical menus you can learn a program even if you know nothing about it. That's not true with ""horrible quilt-menus,"" as I once saw someone call them.  So in short no it's not just you. Overall Firefox has gotten significantly worse over the years. The downward spiral was probably exasperated by the nonsensical Firefox Version 10,002 nonsense too.  Get a load of this ""solution"" to any feedback I find about the search bar change: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1058088  Outright disabling a feature is not a solution. It's outright poor design for hitting enter in a text field to randomly activate a button wherever the mouse happens to be pointing.  Instead of this kind of thing getting reported as a bug, people get suggested to disable the feature outright.  It's just sad that this is but one small example of many.  I really hope things turn around, or I'll switch to Chrome for sure eventually, especially if I'm wrong about my extensions that organize saved files into folders being impossible on Chrome."

I've witnessed a lot of crashes while using Sticky Password desktop client. It would make some pages crash and that would take everything down with it. Would this still be the case, or the tabs will be separated in future, so crashing one won't results in crashing others? In this particular case it wasn't the Sticky Password's addon that was causing the crash, but rather Sticky's desktop process itself. I think if it was the addon then the plugin-container.exe would crash instead of firefox.exe, correct?  Other than this particular case and D2D 1.1 issues, I've never seen Firefox crash.

firefox,3amezw,Morcas,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:47:59 2015 UTC,"No conflicts.  NoScript would definitely break some website layout by blocking scripts and images, but it won't interfere other addons. NoScript requires a one time configuration on many newly visited websites.  Better Privacy deletes LSO (aka ""Flash"") cookies. These days, Firefox handles Flash cookies the same way as regular text based cookies (source: look for ""ClearSiteData"" keyword), so clearing your cookies should get rid of LSO cookies too. However, Better Privacy's settings have an option to delete the Default Flash Cookie too, which is not handled by Firefox's cookie eraser. This Default Flash Cookie supposedly contains the list of sites that you visited, which had Flash content (a lot of them do). So for the sake of privacy, I recommend going into Better Privacy and checking the box to remove the Default Flash Cookie too. This means the manual changes you make to Flash, such as disabling Flash's Hardware Acceleration, which is commonly recommended in order to fix Firefox issues, may not be possible because your settings will be lost when you remove the Default Flash Cookie. I'm just assuming that it will happen because that would make sense. I've never tested it. I did, however, test to verify that removing cookies on Firefox deletes LSO cookies but not the Default Flash Cookie.  If you don't care about configuring Flash then use Better Privacy with that box enabled to remove the Default Flash Cookie too. If you don't care about that extra privacy and don't want to remove the Default cookie, then there is no need to use Better Privacy because you could just remove cookies from Firefox interface, but Better Privacy does provide more flexibility by allowing systematic/automatic LSO deletion which is not available in Firefox.  Pettery Privacy TL;DR  Out of the box, Better Privacy does the same thing that Firefox's ""Remove All Cookies"", but Better Privacy can do more and provide more privacy with few extra clicks.  I've compared Ghostery with other addons, and honestly, I still don't think other privacy addons make it redundant. Some people suggest that Ghostery is not necessary if you have uBlock, but even uBlock creator has a page that shows that Ghostery blocked some things that uBlock missed. You could, of course, add more privacy filters to uBlock but even then it's not guaranteed that it will make Ghostery redundant. Ghostery tells you which tracking companies they block but you can't actually see which trackers from those companies. I was not able to make a fool-proof comparison between that and other addons, therefor I still suggest using Ghostery(especially since it's known t block things that uBlock doesn't?). Ghostery does have some closed source code and it's from an ad company, but as long as you disable the Ghostrank option from settings, it won't send your aggregated data to anyone. So just ignore it when people say Ghostery is spying on you and it's from an ad company and you shouldn't use it.  GoogleSharing does not provide an extra privacy. It actually puts your privacy at risk by sending all your Google search requests to a 3rd party servers which are probably less secure than Google's servers. I would trust Google more than that 3rd party company. Sounds crazy but yeah... I wouldn't use it because of their proxy thing. Use a VPN if you want to hide your IP address from Google. The VPN company could screw you too, but that's highly unlikely if you use a reputable one, also also because they don't store your browsing data. I would trust VPNs more than that addon. Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against that company. I just don't think sending them all my search terms improves my privacy in any way.  AdBlock Plus will show text ads by default, but you can disable those from ABP settings. It also consumes more resources than uBlock, so pretty much everyone these days recommends uBlock Origin (or the plain old ""uBlock"" if you don't care about uBlock Origin's advanced settings).  I made a post about other security/privacy addons. It covers more info about thi  EDIT: added a source link"

firefox,3amezw,Rikvidr,0,Mon Jun 22 13:34:18 2015 UTC,"BetterPrivacy clears flash cookies specifically, so you're fine with that, but you can disable flash cookies altogether.  NoScript is good if you want to allow everything on a specific domain through. I would strongly suggest you take a look at Policeman and uMatrix instead, as they let you whitelist specific elements or element scopes. CSS, image, script, plugin, frame, etc.  Ghostery I do not trust. I would use Disconnect over Ghostery if you must use one of them, but if you use uMatrix or Policeman, neither Ghostery or Disconnect seem necessary.  I'm not sure I understand GoogleSharing fully so I don't want to comment on that, but abine makes a lot of security addons for Firefox. A lot of them do the same thing it seems.  Don't use ABP. ABP will slow down your browsing because even though it's an adblocker it actually only creates site-specific CSS rules to hide the container the ad was in. This means that you're not seeing the ad, but it's still connecting to your computer. You should use uBlock Origin because it actually does block the ads."

Some people might say that it's a security risk, but if you're worried about that, you shouldn't use it for important things like your bank account/bitcoin wallet/primary email. Personally, I think it's a hell of a lot more secure than rotating through the same three passwords for all sites, like most people do; the password generator is pretty awesome.  The settings are very flexible too; you can have it autofill forms, autologin, autologout, and various other things.  This is what I do: automatically sign in when I open the browser, autologin for most sites, except for financial stuff (those passwords stay in my noggin!), and autofill forms with a keyboard shortcut. Note that this is only recommended if you RELIGIOUSLY lock your computer when you leave it. If you're incapable of doing that, or share the computer, I recommend the ""master password"" prompt when opening the browser, and autologout when inactive.  Feel free to ask me any questions!"
firefox,3aiuhc,-Pelvis-,2,Sat Jun 20 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"In general, I prefer FOSS, but the problem it that I've been using Lastpass for so long that my vault is massive, and it would take me quite a while to transfer everything over.  I've been meaning to try Keepass, as I've heard it works very well.  My ideal setup would be something physical, not stored on any servers. Load it up onto a USB key, and then bring it around with me. I wonder how secure using something like that on someone else's computer would be, and if there's a crossplatform solution (I use Linux at home, but would perhaps like to use it for Windows sometimes away from home).  I'll look into it soon."
firefox,3aiuhc,-Pelvis-,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:19:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this; looks like it might be what I needed. However, I'm having trouble finding settings that automatically save the password. Whenever I log in to a site for the first time, LastPass is asking if I want to save for that site. Is there a setting to make it always save without asking? There was a forum post asking the same question, and the answer was no. But that was five years ago, so did they change that?"
firefox,3aiuhc,-Pelvis-,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:54:36 2015 UTC,"Ahh.  You want it to ask before saving. What if it falsely identifies a site, or you make an error entering a password? Even with the confirmation, I found myself making errors when I started using it. It's a pain when you've got a false password saved and have to reset the password and change the lastpass entry (it's not difficult though).  I don't know of a way to automate it, but I wouldn't recommend it. Honestly, how many new things do you sign up for in a day? After the initial flurry of saves when you load all of your commonly used sites onto it, we're talking about perhaps a couple clicks per week. I'm cool with it, and I'm someone who strives for 100% keyboard control."

firefox,3adpg4,fantaairforce,5,Fri Jun 19 07:34:12 2015 UTC,"The default customization options presented by customize window and preferences get you started, but they are really basic in my opinion. about:config has some other built in options beyond what is presented in ""official"" menus but they can only do so much.  The power of Firefox customization mainly comes from how extensions are able to add totally new functionality to the default layout. Some extensions are there just to do one thing, for example to add a button to context menu that closes the current tab. Others, like the already mentioned Classic Theme Restorer, provide plenty of additional options on how the UI behaves.  Often already existing extensions can provide all the functionality one wants, provided they can find one that suits their needs. But what if you need/want to create something totally new? Getting into building a real extension may be a bit much for starters.  I think learning css and the structure of Firefox UI is kinda good starting point. Not too hard, but you can do pretty much just with that. For this there are two in my opinion essential extensions, Stylish and DOM Inspector. I'm not sure how up to date userstyles.org is anymore but it was my starting point, I think around Firefox 2.x.   Userstyles are basically css snippets that modify the looks of the UI and by assigning additional rules to them. Stylish is an extension for managing and writing userstyles. Of course, to write your own rulesets you have to know what elements to target, this is where DOM Inspector comes in. It provides a way to look at the Document Object Model (DOM) and data about all it's elements.  So by looking at the css rules of different userstyles and trying them to see how they affect is pretty good way to experimentally learn something. Just bear in mind that plenty of userstyles are written for outdated versions of Firefox so they may not work correctly anymore, but In my experience trying broken userstyles doesn't break anything permanently. CSS documentation can be found all over the internet but MDN has been invaluable for me at least  But you can't add new functionality with just CSS. For that you really need an extension. Perhaps you need a button that does something the default buttons don't. You could try to find some extension that provides that, but if it's some very specific thing one might not exist. Custom Buttons has the ability to create new buttons that you can program to do pretty much what you want, as long as you can write them. It also has a forum where people have posted their buttons.  But both Custom Buttons and real extensions need some amount of knowledge about javascript as well as APIs that Firefox provides. Thus, I would recommend playing with existing extensions and userstyles first, and after you are somewhat familiar with Firefox DOM you can try writing simple buttons, and maybe extensions too.  Happy customizing, have fun :)"

firefox,3a8kps,not_listed,2,Thu Jun 18 02:08:30 2015 UTC,"Trying to prevent fingerprinting? I created a similar Chrome extension for an info sec class project some time ago. It was just a proof of concept and worked at that, but it did break some sites, most notably gmail.  It changed the HTTP accepts headers and blanked the plugins list (which turned out to be one of the more unique identifiers in our testing). Wasn't any way to truly prevent font detection, though (but enabling a setting in Flash makes it harder).  We decided not to change the user agent because the default on Windows was already very common. Might be worth changing on a different OS (make yourself look like Windows, since it's the most common OS), but I doubt it'll matter much. The user agent has a lot more potential to break sites, anyway, as there's still a lot of bad web devs that are doing browser detection through the user agent.  But it sounds like you're using an existing addon and not a developer, so I'm probably boring. Long story short, don't change the user agent. Assuming you're using the latest stable FF on a major OS, you won't notice a difference. If that's not the case, you could try making yourself appear as the latest stable Windows FF. That should be one of the most common user agents that shouldn't break much (probably just the suggested downloads for sites, since they'll think you're on Windows). Although pretending to be the latest stable Windows Chrome would likely work better, at the risk of breaking more sites.  If your intent is to avoid fingerprinting, hiding the user agent alone will do fuck all. Plugins and fonts are usually far more useful for fingerprinting. And there's no easy way to stop font enumeration. Can just make it harder. On the off chance you are a developer and are interested in techniques, the Chrome extension I previously mentioned is here. I doubt it still works and as mentioned, it has some bugs to iron out. See the presentation folder for an overview."

Flash was never open source, and it was the only way to get DRMed video before (also Silverlight). All we can hope is that Adobe will port their CDM to other platforms, since it's a much simpler proposition than porting Flash ever was.  As for security/privacy concerns, Mozilla is sandboxing the CDMs with an open-source sandbox so they can't phone home or access your drives and such, but there's never a 100% guarantee that a sandbox will work properly. If you don't want to trust the CDM, you can disable/remove it, and Firefox should honor that preference.

They fought for years against DRM and patented codecs like H.264.  But it only hurt their competitiveness.  Places like Netflix will simply not stream without DRM.  They are bound by contract to never do so and users have demonstrated that they want Netflix content.  So Firefox has to support their users.  Mozilla learned that they can only advance the web by supporting it and innovating, not by being obstinate.  Thats said, Firefox went about this in the best way possible.  The DRM module (EME) is sandboxed and limited in a way that Flash and Silverlight never were.  It really has as little possible rights while still providing the DRM that content providers legally require.  Additionally, it comes baked into Firefox so users are more updated and have a better experience then the old Flash model.  And even so, if you really fundamentally disagree (and dont use netflix), Mozilla provides versions that come without the EME module.  I really cannot see how they could have done a better job to all sides.  edit: for typos"

My hardware is from 2011 with i7 2630qm 8GB RAM gtx560m (yes, it is a laptop). So I don't think your problem has anything to do with inadequate hardware.   That still leaves a possibility of driver issues, most probably in display driver. If your processor happens to have integrated graphics chip, it may be worth a try to disable it. At least to test if it would resolve the issue. Nvidia control panel should have the settings for this, I think. For the record, I don't have integrated graphics chip at all."

firefox,3a14oj,caspy7,11,Tue Jun 16 12:18:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not making promises, but so far everyone who has indicated they followed these steps also indicated their problem was fixed.  I'm sure someone will soon fix this glitch in the Matrix for me.  Keep in mind that Youtube now defaults to HTML5 video on Mac & Windows, so if you're having video issues there, they're not likely Flash (unless of course you're forcing its use).  Please report these issues so Mozilla can fix them.   Flash's 'Protected Mode' is a sandbox intended to increase security, however since the beginning it has made for a broken experience for many.  Last I checked Mozilla was working on a browser-side sandbox for Flash in order to disable this very broken feature.  Setting Flash as click to play may help to mitigate issues somewhat but obviously don't get at the underlying issue. This approach can be a bit annoying. Remember that clicking Keep Blocking on a site will make the notification bar to go away for that site in the future.  Both Google and Microsoft employ/pay Adobe to ensure that Flash works well in their browsers.  They also both ship the proprietary Flash code with their browsers.  On the other hand Adobe has mostly abandoned the version of Flash that Firefox uses, occasionally releasing security patches while other simple requests from Mozilla have gone ignored for years.    This has put Mozilla in difficult position of trying to mitigate or workaround the poor Flash experience. Among these efforts are the aforementioned sandbox, MSE for HTML5 video (such as with Youtube), a complete reimplementation of Flash in web standards (Project Shumway) and probably something else I'm forgetting."

If those ads really come from ad services then they are generic and they serve ads for other websites, and such SourceForge specific ads would show up in other websites, completely out of place since they are literally designed for one website and just the one.  I can't imagine how many computers are infected with it and the amount of revenue they are making witch each one going on a 24/7 ad spam + popup on every click vs. the previous bits of ads on their website for the casual users.  In short, I bet (imaginary millions of moneys) that those infected ads are actually created by sourceforge themselves with the clear intent of making profit out of infecting as many users as possible."

Umatrix also blocks w.usabilla.com with (MVPS HOSTS). Ghostery doesn't seem to block http://www.i.cdn.cnn.com/.a/1.149.0/js/vendor/usabilla.min.js so you will need uBlock or NoScript ABE to block this.

firefox,39vr4k,observer,15,Mon Jun 15 04:56:23 2015 UTC,"Servo is a separate research project which isn't going to be put into Firefox just like that. Parts of it likely will be: newer libraries that Servo also uses (one is being experimented with right now), and perhaps algorithms/concepts that Servo shows are viable for the web-at-large. That said, Servo may become a properly viable web browser in its own right at this rate, so it's worth keeping an eye on it regardless.  x64 and Electrolysis are already testable in pre-release builds (and have been for a while), but won't be released until they're fully tested. x64 is likely to happen before Electrolysis because it's closer to being finished. Electrolysis seems to require that OMTC and a bunch of other sub-projects be completed first, and it is still in need of much work, notably performance optimizations and possibly some more addon compatibility. I wouldn't expect it to be released until just after the next ESR release at the earliest (or at least to not be enabled in the next ESR release)."

firefox,39v1i4,dblohm7,2,Mon Jun 15 02:54:14 2015 UTC,"the impression that i got is that chrome is the biggest battery hog of any browser, so they try to implement a few tricks to ease the battery drain and call that optimization. of course that's good for chrome users, although i didn't hear anything about how much it really helps, yet. but it also means that other browsers like firefox don't really need such optimization, since they're probably still more energy efficient than chrome. (at least i assume, please correct me if you have more info.)  of course it might be a good idea to implement similar tricks and optimizations in other browsers as well, but compared to chrome the priority to do so is probably much lower.  regarding ""huge updates"" and ""great new features"", you sound as if you want new features only for the purpose of new features. again, please correct me if i'm wrong. personally, i don't need my browser to have great features, i only need it to work and the rest is userscripts and extensions. ok, that might be slightly exaggerated, but still: if i have a working browser and all the functionality that i need, why should i eagerly await any known or unknown updates?  of course that doesn't mean that development stands still. right now there's another thread about x64 and e10s on the front page, two quite large under-the-hood changes which should be arriving in the coming month/year.  i'm sure there's much more to come, some things good, some things maybe a bit controversial, but as long as my firefox works, added features are not really something i spend much thought on."
firefox,39v1i4,dblohm7,2,Mon Jun 15 18:03:40 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not asking for huge updates for the sake of huge updates but I think it would be good to have something that limits flash, and maybe a voice operating feature like the Google Now on the Browser (which I gather would take quite some time to do which is expected)  But as I said earlier this week is E3 and in order for me to watch it live on Youtube at 720p 60 or 1080p 60 I have to use chrome and not firefox, and HTML 5 is being used  for these videos. I was hoping for more improvement to HTML 5."
firefox,39v1i4,dblohm7,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"ok, i understand. i agree that some improvements are needed in regards to html5 and i think it's almost embarassing that mozilla, which i normally see as very modern and progressive, in some cases isn't able to reliably deliver such an important cornerstone like streaming video, so that's a good point.  as for flash, we already have tools like flash block and adblockers to help with that, but of course that doesn't mean i'm against further reducing ressource usage of flash and other plugins. but even regarding flash, mozilla isn't sitting on its laurels, they are developing a flash substitute called shumway, which should decrease dependency on adobe and hopefully help with stability, performance and security as well.  i agree that some voice features would be interesting for a modern browser, but my hopes in this regard aren't very high, simply because mozilla doesn't seem to have any know how in this area. they probably don't have the cash to buy out some specialist firm neither, so the only way i can see them achieve voice support is partnering up with someone like google (unlikely) or yahoo (do they even have more know how?), or maybe the most likely scenario: someone develops a third party solution, maybe in the form of an addon.  whatever the case, i wouldn't hold my breath.  but looking at it this way, you are right, some new features would be nice indeed! :)"

I recommend swapping it out for Adblock as it's particularly a problem on Firefox. You'll likely notice the memory difference if not the performance too.

Also, if there's not a particular problem that you know it's solving it's best to have it enabled. It's really a workaround that's going to run all (HTML5) video decoding and animations through your CPU instead of your GPU - which can present issues of it's own.  Here are some troubleshooting steps for Flash that have proven quite effective for many:   Use these instructions to fully uninstall and reinstall Flash (they provide a special uninstaller). If that does not do it, try disabling Flash's protected mode.  This is a security measure, so if it does not improve your experience consider reenabling it."

If you allow scripts from Google, you allow them no matter what site you're on.  uMatrix allows you to only allow scripts from Google while on a particular page and block them otherwise.  However, I still have NoScript installed! NoScript has other security features, like basic XSS protection and ""clear click"" protection.  So, even after you allow a site to run javascript, NoScript still checks the scripts to see if they are malicious. uMatrix does not do this.  So, keep NoScript installed and set it to allow scripts globally (use uMatrix to block/unblock scripts), and turn on all of the extra security features of NoScript."

One is that the number of users hasn't gone down, but the percentage has because there are more devices on the internet now, and mostly phones, so chrome and safari have risen enough to offset that percentage. That's kind of what happened with those steam Linux user numbers going around, Linux users have actually grown, but windows users has grown faster which offsets the percentages, despite the growth in actual users. However, the other option is that Firefox user numbers has fallen, and if so, my opinion would also be that its because of phone growth, and people not using their desktops like they used to, or at all. Having to sit down at a desk to use the internet is a thing of the past now, and tablets and phones are replacing old fashioned computers in a large chunk of the population.

More and more people are just using their hand held devices, and the vast majority of them come with either Chrome or Safari preinstalled. I have a fairly nice PC, yet I still use my phones browser a few dozen times a day to quickly check things.  Another thing to keep in mind would be, before Chrome came around Google was a huge backer of Firefox. If you went to a Google page with IE, they would suggest you download Firefox. And they also had an affiliate program where you got $1 per IE user you got to switch to Firefox. It helped Firefox a lot in growing it's user base.  But now when you go to Google pages, instead of promoting Firefox, they tell you to switch away from it to Chrome.  Advertising works.

Maybe Google will get too complacent with Chrome and give Firefox the opening it needs to make a comeback. It's scary that Mozilla now says increasing market share is their immediate goal.

I don't think they are prioritizing things properly , though. They should have fixed the browser issues long time ago but I believe they shelved the Electrolysis project couple of years ago. It was supposed to be out 2 years ago AFAIK. Firefox is their main cash source, yet they kept ignoring its issues."
firefox,39p0ag,dblohm7,6,Sat Jun 13 17:32:52 2015 UTC,"There's a lot more to this situation than people seem willing to actually explore, in lieu of just saying Mozilla is ignoring Firefox and its users.  After vetting their codebase several years ago, it turned out that Electrolysis wasn't going to happen at that time - the code was simply too old and backward and fragile. They had to fix a ton of things to get it to a point where Electrolysis was even feasible, so they shelved Electrolysis for a while to do those things. For instance, getting the browser multi-threaded, and getting their graphics engines modernized. Also Australis, which included a number of fixes and such that were necessary for Electrolysis (though we can debate the merits of the other outcomes of the Australis effort).  The real problem is that these kinds of efforts aren't as easy to sell to users. As others have stated, nobody cares about subtler improvements. All they care about is that the UI changed, and there's a new button in their toolbar they don't want (not that I'm saying those concerns are invalid). Also, Chrome was already built as a modernized browser from the get-go, so users suddenly had a choice to flock to it instead of waiting for Firefox to improve. Doubly so when the path to those improvements is necessarily complicated and can mean temporary breakage and problems. Ideals don't matter to most people, especially when there's a free alternative that's better for their present needs.  Heck, it took Microsoft just as long to fix Internet Explorer, and they're only getting there now. But they only had to worry about Windows systems, and not others. Firefox supports a lot more platforms, and they also got their browser on the Android platform during the same time... they even tried to fight with Apple to get Firefox proper on iOS (and ultimately lost, which is why they recently had to just suck it up and make a Safari re-skin and pretend it's Firefox).  In short, there's a lot of nuance here that people choose to not care about because there are other, more visible things to complain about."

firefox,39p0ag,smartfon,3,Sun Jun 14 05:12:21 2015 UTC,"But if it doesn't result in a tiny increase on some borderline-meaningless benchmark, who cares? :)  All jokes aside, I honestly think the performance differences between Firefox and other browsers are almost down to a point where it's just polish and perceived differences 95% of the time, and the other 5% are cherry-picked cases that are just better-optimized on one browser, or hardware acceleration issues that aren't handled as well by a given browser on a given system.  I've actually timed how long it took for a user to get to a big page in Chrome and Firefox, and they said it ""felt"" faster in Chrome, but Firefox actually beat Chrome. I'd even go so far as to say that it's a case of the marketing overpowering the reality in some cases."

Oddly, IE (63%) is second in the race, and Chrome (46%) is terribly behind.  As you stated, this is integral. People consume Web pages, and the more technology is available to a developer, the more they will use it, giving a clear advantage over browsers that simply can't understand modern code. I remember when Chrome lead in almost everything, but Firefox has played steady, and they're clearly technologically superior. The end of 2015 will really drive that fact home when e10s rolls out to the public.

Google is pushing Chrome really hard, with stuff on their web pages plus lots of software installing Chrome by default. They even made YouTube work better with Chrome. What Google is doing may be unfair and unethical, but it's effective.  Mozilla doesn't seem to have risen to the challenge. Important new features take a long time. The advertising doesn't seem especially good. Features that do get added don't seem intelligently chosen and leveraged as part of a plan to make Firefox more appealing."

You should not be sniffing for a particular browser engine/family, but rather for specific deficiencies/bugs that you have to work around. What they're doing here is fundamentally no better than a user-agent sniff, and possibly could be worse: Edge (and possibly Firefox) will potentially be implementing webkit-prefixed features, because site creators didn't think to include non-prefixed versions of the features too. So you could even be dooming the wrong browsers if you sniff like this, and if a browser fixes a bug you think you've cleverly hacked around, you're still penalizing the fixed versions.

It allows devs to work around bugs in a particular engine at the time that the code was written, but if that changes in the future and the web devs aren't staying on top of it, the website will end up serving outdated code that no longer has the intended affect.   Edge (and possibly Firefox) will potentially be implementing webkit-prefixed features, because site creators didn't think to include non-prefixed versions of the features too. So you could even be dooming the wrong browsers if you sniff like this.   Yeah, that's why everybody's stopped prefixing their experimental stuff and hiding them behind prefs instead."

Well, it will be a lot easier to want to use it if it's not crashing or misbehaving, so I was going after that particular fruit.  Apparently Chrome can also end up with profile issues over time and complaints just grow.  Mozilla is working on further tools to fix deeper profile issues.  But it's addons system is more powerful, so an addon can be a significant contributor to poor experience.  There are probably a few approaches philosophically. One is that Google is working to make it a Chrome world and perfectly content with seeing and encouraging chrome-only ""web"" content and apps.  It is getting as bad as it was in the days of the IE world except we're not sufficiently bothered by this.  Their coverage of tracking is impressive.  I have an android phone and even without Chrome, I do a maps search and hop in the car and my phone is offering directions to that search.  One of many examples. But the point is that Google is very interested in having their fingers in every part of your life and profiting from that.  That could be profiting more directly (serving ads based on site visits) or perhaps indirectly (influencing your opinion on topics in their interests).  I feel we have put too many of our eggs into one basket whose interests is not for our benefit, but for their profit.    You've heard the phrase absolute power corrupts absolutely? Well I think it's pretty true and Google has and is gaining increasing power and leverage in a great many areas of technology and internet life.  It's concerning because we already know their motivations are not for our ultimate good, but at the very least are mixed. ""Don't be evil."" isn't a great montra (better than ""Be evil"") but over time what what evil is begins to morph in your mind.  Most of the ""evil"" rich and powerful did not get there the quick route and if their past selves had seen their future selves, they would have denied the possibility that they would ever become such animals.

Its about them endorsing , promoting and actively encouraging all its users to use a 3rd party for storing their bookmarks and describing it as 'the best'. Despite their appalling privacy policy, lack of open source and no clarity on how our data will be used.  I expect Mozilla to reject that not promote it.  I also expect Mozilla to allowus to access all of the internet , websites, plugins and search engines from 3d parties if we wish.  But I dont  expect it to agree with everything on the internet because it allows access to all of it.  The problem is that Mozilla, who are trusted by millions have used that reputation for openness and fairness and supporting strong privacy to misslead millions of users into using a service which collects data and has  no open code and  a poor privacy policy, in order to make money.   This goes against everything they claim to be about.  The very purpose of Firefox is to help secure users privacy in an open way.   Pocket is the antithesis of this.  Mozilla backs pocket with flair.  Look at the ad that pops up on the recent upgrade. Its describes pocket as 'the best' way to store your data."

If Mozilla needs to exist to fight invasion of privacy on the internet, this company would be second only to Google as its arch enemy.   This is a massive concern for the way Mozilla is heading.  As Cory Doctorow said about Mozilla's DRM integration , its heartbreaking. This is even worse.  Mozilla does not care about privacy, and there is no greater breach of it than a deal with the Pocket app company, useful as it may be.  Promoting it is nothing short of disturbing.  Not to mention Pockets underhanded lawsuit threat to Wallabag developers, an open source, pro privacy software alternative to pocket.

Mozilla makes a browser. Not just for you and me, but everyone. Many of us disagree with Pocket, but many others don't (as evidenced by how popular the addon is/was). Heck, the feature is only activated when you, well, activate it.  In fact Facebook-type services can already be integrated with the Social API in Firefox since version 29 or so, and third-party search engines like Google are already integrated for much longer. Firefox has practically always had third-party affiliations that you seem to have idealistic conflicts with.  Not to mention that services like Pocket aren't innately evil just because they can be. I don't even see evidence of a lawsuit after a basic web search. I also get the feeling that nobody complaining about Pocket's third-party status has actually read their Privacy Policy (although I've not seen Mozilla's custom policy with regard to Pocket, it seems unlikely that it would be worse).  People here love to just view everything as a dire, dire situation and wag their fingers at Mozilla. But again: knowledge and perspective are important.

I don't care how people use their browser, I m not even that bothered about having it as an option.  Just as Google search or amazon or whatever is an option.  What I am against and what annoys me most is Mozilla actively promoting and advertising this feature to its users with a full page ad about how great pocket is with no discussion or warnings about privacy, its an ad,  big glossy one, when its automatically upgraded to latest Firefox users are told how brilliant pocket integration is!  That's the problem.  That's not what Mozilla is about.  It doesn't and hasn't don't this for other third parties except hello.  It might as well advertise for Facebook integration."

If you dislike the fact that Mozilla is trying to assure people that Pocket is ok to use, and potentially making Pocket some money, that's your prerogative. Mozilla has done the same for others in the past, including Google and Yahoo and Facebook. Mozilla is not here to cater to our idealism. They're here to try to protect THEIR ideals, and those ideals have never included ""make no money"" or ""make no money for our affiliates"" or ""avoid affiliating with anyone"". Some of us seem to think that's true, but it isn't. Our privacy can be protected even if they affiliate with people we don't like. Hell, Google was far worse, and they're still affiliated with them and making them money (default search engine in Europe). Perspective."

As open and secure and protecting your privacy. Its funded by donors (me) and it has a very vocal privacy policy and anti corporate ethos.  Glossy promotional vids to go with it.   If it doesn't adhere to this then it deceived its users, but more importantly it ceases to offer anything the other browsers don't.  Everyone knows chrome is better in every way except for the privacy issue.  Let's not pretend Mozilla offers something it doesn't beyond privacy and ethos."
firefox,392brq,thiswebthisweb,3,Tue Jun 9 00:00:29 2015 UTC,"You (and others) still haven't proved to me that Mozilla has failed to keep users more private that the other vendors.

firefox,392brq,DrDichotomous,0,Tue Jun 9 00:02:36 2015 UTC,"Er by actively advising users to use pocket, pocket breaches your privacy. That's how it makes money.   Mozilla supoorts and integrates pocket. Sure you 'consent' but as I you say yourself, who reads the privacy policy?   And can you tell me how chrome breaches privacy more than Mozilla now that Mozilla integrates Pocket, chrome integrates Google.  Both data mining corporations likely selling your personal data to the highest bidder. But we don't know.  Which is exactly the problem."
firefox,392brq,thiswebthisweb,3,Tue Jun 9 00:11:44 2015 UTC,"By defaulting to Yahoo or Google, Firefox is also helping those guys to our data. But we choose to do so (or not do so). As for ""who reads the privacy policy"", it doesn't seem like you actually did. Pocket doesn't have to make money by giving away our information or privacy, even if they still use our information to that aggregate end. Now, Pocket may be lying, or I may have missed some tiny print. Could you please help me find out? And if you're just to assume the worst of them, then stop pretending that you actually know.

firefox,392brq,thiswebthisweb,3,Tue Jun 9 00:23:26 2015 UTC,"It's not silly at all. What's silly is to assume the worst and just stop there, making up shit to get ourselves angrier and angrier. You need both approaches and perspectives to get the full story. ""You can't prove it"" is a flimsy-ass argument because YOU can't prove they're being bad, either. That gets us nowhere.  We shouldn't be striving to assume Mozilla to death, but to hold them to their word and give them some benefit of the doubt until we know they're being evil... not just until we PRESUME they're being evil. Ditto Pocket - if there's good evidence that they're being terrible, then please share it. Then we'll have actual cause to vilify them.

It essentialky says we will use all your data as we wish without exception  (unless you are  a child - under 16 ).    Its all there.  It doesn't say they make money,  it doesn't mension money or profit at all.  (Odd? who funds them? It doesnt mention that either you see) But whether they make money or I am paranoid  or not isn't the point.  the point is they don't want us to own our data they want to own it. And they do.  All of it.  And the met data.  All of which has extremely high financial value."
firefox,392brq,thiswebthisweb,5,Tue Jun 9 00:34:55 2015 UTC,"Of COURSE they will ""collect"" your information, because you have to send it to their servers for their service to be worth anything, right? But I don't see any sign that they're abusing the data, just that they use it as most companies in order to ""improve their services"" and such. They even explain the one way they will use your email address.  As for third-party stuff, their actual current policy has this to say:   Except as set forth below, we do not share any personally identifiable information unless you expressly agree that we may do so.    Below that, there are two paragraphs with:   If you choose to make the content you save publicly available,   If you choose to, you may connect your Pocket account to third-party applications,   So you're opting into those, and they make no mention of selling your information, just sharing it with third-party apps you choose to use in conjunction with Pocket.  Below that:   We may work with trusted third parties ... and we may provide some of your personal information directly to [them] ... [such as] a third party payment processor to process payments for our paid subscription service. [They] are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide to them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses.   Which hardly seems like a dead-ringer for ""our trusted third parties are tracking networks and ad agencies"", but then they also mention that they have confidentiality agreements, so perhaps we should contact them to find out more specifics.  The only worrying thing I see there is:   In the event that we or certain of our assets are acquired, user information may be included among the transferred assets.    But again, I don't see a spot where you don't have to opt into making the data available to their third-party affiliates, or making it public, and I don't see any hard evidence that they're sitting there diddling with our data. They obviously need to store it to provide their service, though, so it's not going to be easy to convince one way or the other.  Is there legalese that I'm naively missing that's cunningly saying they're going to abuse the data we save on their servers? I hope not... but please let me know.  As for making money, it seems like they offer a paid subscription service. I too find it tough to believe that's enough to sustain them, but they don't seem like a huge company to me, and their addons for browsers are pretty popular, so there's a good chance that's all it is. I've worked with startups and small firms who CAN sustain themselves off of subscriptions and freemium services, and Pocket seems pretty popular to me."

firefox,391zwe,complex_reduction,3,Mon Jun 8 20:03:42 2015 UTC,"Well, if we're talking about speed, caching advertising (image banners/swf) is pointless since they change with every reload of the page. Caching the page/article content is also pointless, since it's unlikely you'll be reading the same article over and over. The things that are most useful to cache are scripts, css, the website UI (the menus, borders, bars etc.) which are small in capacity (KB). But if FF flushes them to accommodate the thumbnails and banners, then it becomes pointless.  Also, since you did mention the latency, in order for FF to determine witch of the cached files it has to load (especially when they don't have an expiry header), it has to connect to the webpage.., which means you still can't get away from latency. And even if all cached files have an expiry header, you still have to wait until all the rest of content (that has not been cached previously) to be downloaded until you have a page with fully drawn content."

My personal opinion is that 'disk cache' without precise control over what's cached, is kind of pointless. Especially if you don't use an adblocker. Lots of banners and thumbnails(that are no longer necessary on a secondary load) will be cached, wasting space.. Some web developers will set short expiry time in order to promote their content (like advertising) thus forcing the browser to download new content (like new banners) often and in the process flushing the useful cached content (like scripts, menus, buttons, bars etc…) when the cache gets full. I haven't used it in more then 5-6 years, so I don't know if things changed on this front, but if they are the same, it's only worthy (sort of) when you set the cache to a few GB.., which is a waste (considering the small benefits) and not to mention a privacy concern (if the computer is shared with others)."

firefox,38ylki,xelaseer,8,Mon Jun 8 20:24:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think a lot of the frustration is that the same old arguments are being hashed and rehashed, many of the misconceptions about how Hello and Pocket works, why Mozilla did these things and what sort of data Mozilla is collecting are endlessly tossed around in these same threads which keep popping up, regardless of how many posts have been made refuting them.   There are legitimate complaints to be made, particularly with regards to Pocket, marketing decisions and graphical issues, and recently Mozilla has been more reactive than innovative. However, there is also a lot of FUD, particularly whereby users post with 'silent majority'-type arguments complaining of 'useless' features that no one uses, bloat, etc or solipsistic declarations of 'ownership'. The emotive language is now such that the level of discourse has sharply declined in this sub."

Which is why we see, at least in the beginning, massive -1x/2x numbers for posts defending a new FF decision or at least not joining the bash-in.  It usually balances out in the end to a single negative digit at worst.  In the Australis days it was unbearable (As mods and other firefox users will remember).  Most comments favourable to Australis or defensive of FF as a product or its devs was downvoted   People think that if they band together and shout with self-importance they actually should get to decide what happens (even if they do absolutely little more than complaining and condemning in absolutist terms).

I'm just offering my view which is way more cynical than yours, apparently, as to what is the reality of this ""space"" we have in /r/firefox.   I don't think it's possible to be very nice when attacks are repetitive and not actually constructive and every iteration (Usually Ui changes) they have the same patterns of veiled threats.  It's good to have optimists like you, though.  Probably makes it possible for moderates to find a ""safe haven"" in these kinds of posts."
