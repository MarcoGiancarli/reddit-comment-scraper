incremental_games,3e48sx,Jagarlak,6,Tue Jul 21 20:57:18 2015 UTC,"For me, prestige-heavy games (e.g. Clicker Heroes) get annoying when they become very repetitive and active - a tight prestige loop means idling is generally worthless because manual intervention is required every few minutes to make useful progress.  If this describes at least some of your reasons for wanting to avoid prestige, I'd suggest Matter of Scale.  In MoS you manage several incrementals concurrently, which individually prestige very frequently and in a highly automated fashion (even when idle) - in short, it's not burdensome in the same way."

incremental_games,3dz5q1,TheAutsider,5,Mon Jul 20 18:40:23 2015 UTC,"Meteorjs in my experience has been less than ideal for a game with frequent updates like 50 updates/second for number crunching. IIRC, idlelands uses Meteorjs, and it is open source so check it out for some implementation ideas."
incremental_games,3dz5q1,dSolver,2,Mon Jul 20 18:42:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for mentioning Idlelands, looks like something that would be usefull for my research.   I'm thinking about using a combination of ngCookies for local storage and Meteors 2 way data binding with a slower update rate. The real time data would be calculated locally and the important multiplayer data should be minimal (and in the beginning optional)."
incremental_games,3dz5q1,dSolver,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"why not simply use localStorage? I'm not sure that Cookies would give any advantage. Slower update rates are absolutely fine, but it sounds like you'd be doing some processing on the client's machines - in which case, if it's a multiplayer game, what sorts of mechanisms would you implement to limit/prevent cheating?"

There are a lot of engines out there but most don't play well with Angular directives and services or are a pain to serialize to and from localStorage/localForage, etc.  That is in part my motivation behind making angular-ecs (https://github.com/Hypercubed/angular-ecs).  Maybe this is useful for you.  My goal was to make a game engine that feels like part of angular.

Gold is easily obtainable. The game feels barren, not in the sense of players but with content. 6.2 brought tannan which is a daily reputation grind and a poorly constructed one at that. The shipyard came which was a phone app with a better UI. Then we mythic dungeons which are cool but what heroics should have been. You out-gear them rather quickly would have rather just had 1-2 new dungeons. The time walking events which are just a shell of what the content really was years ago. The only thing that saves this patch is that the raid is very well done. I hate that I love this game. Its current state feels awful, it feels nothing like it use to be."

incremental_games,3dmlbw,LtPaincakes,-3,Fri Jul 17 21:15:01 2015 UTC,"I started playing and so far this is exactly like Clicker Heroes, every spell is the same, hero system is the same, even the multiplier after lvl 200 is the same, the early game is exactly the same grinding or even slower, and I've played CH from the start quite a few times already, so I know what I'm talking about.

Best option is to wait until you have a few more, exactly like you do in CH. That means you'll reset after 2-3 days, maybe less if you're 24/7 clicking on the game. Not really faster than CH.  I'm not saying this game is bad, not at all. But it's definitely not original either. You guys just see the 3D(more like 2.5D) and are all like ""Wow! Amazeballs!"""

Also, flash WAS dominant on Kong for many years, however, if you look at the trend of games over the last year, or even the last 3 months, only a small portion are actually flash.  Many devs have gone to other languages, like unity and Javascript.  personally, I'm in the same boat.  I know flash and stencyl (and QBasic :P), and I don't even know if I'm going to able to continue devving games, as I can't seem to grasp the concept of using Javascript to show anything anywhere except the console."

If you never used Flixel or Flashpunk or any sort of Flex library and only ever use Flash itself directly, I, uh, I am less sure how to help you there.  EDIT: The first major initial stumbling block I had in using Phaser is the fact you need a local web server. I had a public Dropbox folder so I used that to start with but then moved over to Mongoose, which runs a server in the directory you put it in by default and is just incredibly simple to work with."

incremental_games,3dax4a,Kostronor,2,Wed Jul 15 10:06:43 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this for a while, and I've come up with a solution: money. There would be a market like in the tight spot challenge in Factorio. The bot would start out with a certain amount of money with which it could use to buy equipment to build the factory. In turn, it would sell a player-chosen product at a certain price (the more complex the product, the higher the price). The bot would budget what it earns, like using 50% to buy more equipment and 50% to be used by the player. The player could use money to do something like funding research to improve the bot or discovering new recipes.  Something like this would give the player more control over the game while still letting the bot do its own thing."

They both give you ""clickfish"" items when you click them. The inventory is partially functional.  I'm not entirely pleased about how items look, but it will do for now.

Loading I can either read that encrypted string back out from player prefs, or load it from the clipboard again.   Why encryption? I've heard recommended to simply convert to base64, but that's super easy for a player to reverse(there are online tools), modify, and save again. I'm not super worried about cheating, but I do like to at least cover the extreme basics. Instead, I use a bit of basic encryption you can find here. Look in the middle and the encrypt/decrypt class. That will take in a string(your xml string) and spit out another string that can be exported/imported. Let me know if you have other questions!"

incremental_games,3da2ys,jawbit,7,Tue Jul 14 17:58:23 2015 UTC,"Played for about 15 minutes and decided to look at code out of curiosity.   I really like the theme of the game, it uses a lot of ideas from real life and different fields of science. The concept of mining is interesting and so is the chemical reaction part where you get to build atoms. For UI, it might be better to hide all the ""???"" category until you unlock them. It took a few seconds to discover psychology initially. For UI, put the ""test mode button"" somewhere far away, it's easy to accidentally click on it. For the question of ""are there enough machanics?"" my answer is that there are definitely enough. In fact you have so many mechanics that it will take so much efforts to polish and complete them. That is, if you decide to push this to version 1.0. The game has many bugs. I managed to run into errors several times just by clicking around in computer science and geology. In your code, I noticed how you drew the upgrade tree using canvas, mad respect! In your code, I noticed a lot of duplications. You should consider using more loops and functions more just to make your life easier. Again, respect the effort.   I like the idea, and would like to see new updates. While it's up to you how far you want to push this game, I think the scope is big and it's going to take a hell lot of efforts to fully complete and polish it."
incremental_games,3da2ys,fishtastic,3,Tue Jul 14 18:51:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the big reply! I'll respond to what you brought up.   Psychology is supposed to be available from the start, as achievements are kinda omnipresent. It's so far to the right because I organized the tabs based on the hierarchy of sciences. I'll move the button right now, thanks. I'm happy to take on an intensive project like this, I want to give you guys something big and unique. Would you mind telling me of any specific bugs? Thanks. Thanks! I asked you guys and this seemed like the best way to do it. I think the full, deep upgrade tree will   look great. I know it's super messy, but unless I see a drop in performance, I figure I'll keep focusing on making new content.   Thanks again!"
incremental_games,3da2ys,fishtastic,2,Tue Jul 14 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"Alright, more reviews here. I played for another 1/2 hour or so. The game gets less interesting after sometime. Bugs/issues I found   Off/on state for ""test mode"" doesn't actually do anything since clicking on it just gives you a lot of money. Under computer science, if you click on any button for workshop without selecting in dropdown, you get an error. Click equip in geology without tool selection causes error. Under biology, you can go to planet 11 when you only have 10 planets in astronomy If you use up planet in astronomy you can still go over the limit in biology. ""Add to field"" doesn't work correctly in Biology, it consumes your water but your culture shows up as NaN instead of the correct number. (not a bug) Why do you have 32 elements in chemistry when most of them are useless? It becomes really hard to make water. (possible bug) I can't figure out how to upgrade from tiny spade. (possible bug) When does the last part show up in computer science? I have a lot of silicons but nothing shows up. Astronomy ans psychology goes above 100% completion level. The ""big bang button"" doesn't work yet.   Again, regarding the scope of this project. It's ambitious. Pushing yourself to fully polish and complete it will take much efforts. Good luck to you!"
incremental_games,3da2ys,sebtoast,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:11:02 2015 UTC,"Of course it gets boring after a while, it's missing all the content! Like I said, I still have yet to create 90% of the:   achievements upgrades lab notes cs parts digging tools organisms   not to mention implementing prestige (big bang), the wormhole, sociology, and the secret tab (which you might have found in the code). I just wanted to get the mechanics up and running and some fresh eyes on it to spot bugs, which all of you have definitely helped with!"

incremental_games,3da2ys,Eclipse1agg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:59:52 2015 UTC,"Closed the tab by mistake and lost the progress but it's no big deal, I'll wait for the next update. I was waiting to have enough carbon to unlock either astronomy or the other one that I can't remember what it is."
incremental_games,3da2ys,1234abcdcba4321,3,Wed Jul 15 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"I see this going places. :)  The text on the button ""Buy and specialize: 2000 strings"" doesn't incease, even though the actual price is higher if you have more than 0 atoms.  The computer science part ""Dusty disk drive"" even after you've bought it has the ""Buy: 2 silicon"" in it's name.  Not at all beeing able to choose what element the atom becomes can get a bit annoying. Possibly make it so that you can pay a higher price for a specific atom or maybe trade 2 to 1 of any kind to another of the basic elements? You can get stuck a bit waiting to get the correct ones.  If you plan on expanding the upgrade tree, I suggest you put down some acheivements that you can see so you know how to get them. Keep the hidden ones, but add like ""have 50 protons"", ""create 10 molecules"" etc. Right now it's somewhat hard to understand how to progress."
incremental_games,3da2ys,Jkevo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:04:09 2015 UTC,"Ah crap, those are both good catches. I'll get on that. And there is an upgrade to let you choose your element, you just have to find it ;) And yeah, I was thinking that's what psychology research would do, reveal achievement names/descriptions, but that'd be kind of an underwhelming use of a computer science slot. Maybe I'll just have them revealed after a time. Thanks!"
incremental_games,3da2ys,Jkevo,3,Tue Jul 14 19:18:20 2015 UTC,"Although I like the basic concept, the execution leaves some to be desired.  The game SEEMS pretty straightforward, but it took me a while to understand what was going on. For instance, and is a silly example, I spend a few seconds clicking ""Logic"" and thinking ""huh, nothing happens?"". The initial screen shouldn´t be an options screen.  The biggest problem I see is that there is no way to see all your resources at once, and this is critical since resources are used by different sections. So I do need Carbon for Astronomy, how much do I have?  I hope that helps."
incremental_games,3da2ys,Jkevo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"I should have the game open the Physics tab to start, you're right. I could also have a tab that shows all resources (there are a lot). I will at least make sure that a resource appears on every tab it's relevant in. Thanks!"
incremental_games,3da2ys,Nurkanurka,2,Tue Jul 14 19:14:15 2015 UTC,"I can't seem to unlock chemistry, is that not implemented yet?  Now I can. I guess you need more than three?  How do you get silicon?"

incremental_games,3d1zch,grammarxcore,0,Sun Jul 12 23:30:54 2015 UTC,"The depth is great. There's quite a bit to do now. I'm only on world 18, which is what I meant by the pacing. Compared to the last version I played, everything costs way more, but that does add length to the game."
incremental_games,3d1zch,Brownprobe,2,Sun Jul 12 23:45:55 2015 UTC,"For science, how long do you think you spent playing to get to 18?"
incremental_games,3d1zch,grammarxcore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:01:33 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest balance issue right now is how equipment upgrades scale. Before, I was able to buy too much too fast, getting me to very high worlds before my population was able to cope with the Coordination upgrades. Now, though, I do think the equipment ROI is too low. Before, I bought 40-50 of each upgrade and was too lazy to buy more. Now, I'm lucky to produce/farm enough metal to get 5 or 6 before unlocking the next upgrade. Meanwhile, combat is very, very slow. I have enough block to take most of the enemy's attack, but I'm doing so little damage and have so little health that I die before doing very much damage to the enemy. More often than not, I block everything, but combat still drags on because enemy health is very high compared to my damage.  Putting all of that together is hard. I don't have much to offer in terms of tweaking formulas. In terms of the big picture, I think you've slowed the game way down, which is good, because it adds length. My impatience comes from playing early iterations of the game. I need to relax and enjoy the upgrades.  I do have one good suggestion that could speed things up a little bit: if my block is higher than the max enemy damage, I should autokill the enemy. Right now the only purpose those combats serve is to drag out a map, which is not a good way to add length. If I watch the game during those moments, there is very little enjoyment. If I'm actually taking damage, then combat once again becomes a question of whether or not I die before the enemy does, bringing value back. Granted, you could argue that I really don't need to be watching the game at larger stages, but that implies you want your players to leave, which isn't good. Perhaps you could make the block autokill length a function of damage to HP ratios or something, so that it's still longer than a OHKO but shorter than actually going through the whole combat. That would add another layer of complexity, i.e. I can now optimize combat through attack/HP or block."
incremental_games,3d1zch,Brownprobe,2,Mon Jul 13 00:33:28 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want to make it so you one shot something if your block is higher, than their attack, but I could see how it would make sense to hit for twice as hard if you block everything, a counterattack or such.   I'm still working on the prestige costs, I really want to make them not hurt you if you upgrade it too early. My two ideas right now are a) really bringing down the increased cost from prestiging or b) making it so that only one prestige book drops per level instead of two, so that people will be more ready for the new prestige by the time they get it.   I'm going to work on a few different options tonight and see which one works best. I'm also going to try and add in a new optional interface for advanced map creation, where you can chose which level map you want to make (no higher than current zone), and chose to spend extra fragments on better maps."
incremental_games,3d1zch,grammarxcore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"I agree about not one-shotting (the 1.1 second time), but I think a flat value rewards people who put a little bit into block more than people who put a lot into defense. Going back to my ratio idea, maybe something like that? If my block is higher than enemy max attack, my attacks do (block divided by max enemy attack)% extra  damage. That way, I can play the middle road and balance my distribution, I can go attack/HP with metal, or block with wood.  I think you should lower the prestige costs, but not by a huge amount. Like I said, the last version I played went way too fast. What's your current formula? I'm being lazy and don't want to find it in the code.  I'm not quite sure you should limit Map rewards to one drop per level. The player needed those to progress in the World. However, with v1.0, I've been struggling to get enough attack/HP to actually complete Maps. Before, I was flying through maps and slowing on World progression. Now I'm flying through the World and slowing on Maps. Getting an equilibrium will be really, really hard in terms of the right numbers, but I feel like reducing current prestige rewards would skew progress toward the World, because Coordination would be the primary source of combat gains. As it currently stands, I'm stuck trying to get Coordination to level. If you lower prestige costs, it should wobble a little closer to the middle.  As an aside, I really like your game. It's not often that I go this in-depth into balancing discussions because many of the things I play aren't on this level. Please don't take this criticism as pure complaint; it's high praise."
incremental_games,3d1zch,Brownprobe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:11:27 2015 UTC,"Trust me when I say that I really really appreciate any and all feedback, suggestions, and criticism to the game. I really want this game to be fun for as many people as possible, and I know that I don't always know what's best.  I really like the idea of taking the amount of block that you have above the enemies attack and shooting some percentage of it back. I think I would need a good way to convey where the extra damage is coming from and how hard it's hitting, so I'll have to think about the best way to do this.   I'll PM you some formulas if you're still interested!"
incremental_games,3d1zch,jamosup,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:36:10 2015 UTC,"i think the only thing I feel is that enemy stats (especially health; enemies early on I can expect to kill in 1-3 hits, while near the end before I did my first soft reset it would take 15-20 hits to kill one enemy) outscale you pretty fast (by world 20, I started feeling a ""soft reset wall"" type where I felt I would eventually plateau and take exponentially longer to progress - considering what else you can do at world 20, that's likely intended, though due to how difficult the secret map was, I went all the way to world 23 to get coordination upgrades since it was taking eons to increase my stats otherwise), but it also feels like the amount of time to regenerate one battle group starts getting pretty rough, as well.  this is all before my soft reset, though, so it's likely part of it was just due to the game encouraging me to do so. it's possible that the difficulty of the special map from a20 could be dialed back a bit or fixed at level 20 rather than 21 (if you were afk while playing for long enough, would buying the specific upgrades cause the map to spawn as level 22? even one level above 21 could have easily added days to waiting for the stats you need to finish it reasonably. (i never got to the point where I was technically making 0 progress (one-shotted by a first strike enemy 100% of the time), but it took so long I went back to the regular world to get coordination)).  the soft reset awards seemed reasonable to start, the first one gave me a good overall boost without overpowering me or being too insignificant, though it'll be a little while before I would want to consider going past an immediate reset when available.  edit: extra question: i don't remember how I got it the first time, is there a special requirement to getting the level 10 unique map? i would definitely like the extra source of block, and I'm not sure if something bugged or I'm missing a prerequisite - I'm almost at the end of world 11 and don't have the map after creating maps from fragments in world 10 and 11 along with fully getting all map items up to 11."

Why is there still a limit on how many hamlets I can have? Getting more hamlets speeds you up a lot, so they shouldn't be exactly cheap to get, but atm I see no reason why they should be limited at 6. (please, please, make it happen :) ) While non-linear costs (and effects) are generally good for most incremental games, I liked the old version of ""reduce autobuy cost"" research much more. But that's just my opition, I have no real reasoning why it should be done that way. It just felt better when you were able to make it 100% efficient reasonably fast. Some quest are just way harder than others. For example: ""Get 50 bloodhounds"" and ""Have 20000 income from River"". I get that they shouldn't be all the same difficulty and there are the harder ones are more rewarding, but imo the gap between some is just wayyyy too big. The manager mod ""Increase income of tier X by Y% for each building"" is just OP imo. None of the other manager's mods can compare...   Still a great game and great update :) Keep doing good work."

It should say ""can be assigned to Hamlets"" at level 1 and ""can be assigned to Villages or below"" at level 2, and so on.    The only thing that increases the quality of your managers is the Talent modifier.  It is basically like Magic Find in Diablo - the higher it is, the higher rarity you can get.

Another idea is to display % value of each building income. Lets say that I have archer 100x 10 income and spearman 100x 5 income. Archer gives 1000/s and spearman 500/s so spearman gives 33%/s and archer 66%/s of ""total"" income. This way its easy for peoples to say which building is giving most income atm.

incremental_games,3d0t5p,-RedditPoster,3,Mon Jul 13 07:24:08 2015 UTC,"The reason is that I want the player to directly engage with the game.  Leaving the browser open implies he is doing so or at least plans on doing so in the near term.  Essentially, keeping the browser open keeps the game visible while closing it means you may never re-open it.  It is the same reason I have the active clickables on a random timer and require you to click on them instead of just giving you more resources every few minutes.  I already went the extra mile of having the catch up run through the full logic of the game in increments versus the simpler method of just running a 5000 second tick when the game starts (which is how most offline-modes work).  So rather than coming back after a day with your Hamlets sporting 5000000 deer, they will actually auto-complete, new ones will spawn, and those can also auto-complete.  I think the compromise is fair."

CTRL+Click for Max buy with current resources  1-9 for the tiers of locations. So 1 would select the first hamlet, 2 selects the first village etc., so you can quickly assign/change out managers. Likewise, would be sweet if I could click a manager and then assign him with these hotkeys.  To prevent confusion if you go with this, you should reverse the sorting on the location list, as the higher tiers are higher on the list.  Absolutely amazing game otherwise. You found an unique way of scaling. Looks are decent enough, only a few ugly tidbits (like manager selection & the blue manager colour makes the font hard-ish to read), pacing is awesome, and managers are the best commodity there is.

You are clicking on a mutation crystal or bad guys or something and the power ups you get are actually super powers, abiltiies, and skill levels. And as you go further in the game you go from stopping muggers to cosmic universal stuff. To enable prestige you'd have to ""reboot"" the series from issue 1 and start your origin story again. You can spend prestige points eventually for ""retcons"". Retcons are making it so you always started the game with a specific power already enabled.  Now each power would not all be a ""building"" like in all other games where it just attacks the main thing. Some would be support/defensive powers that enhance others or cripple the opponents in some ways.

So, take a look at theses pieces of codes, if you don't understand something, ask me :  <div class=""progress"">   <div id=""mainProgressBar"" class=""progress-bar"" role=""progressbar"" aria-valuenow=""0"" aria-valuemin=""0"" aria-valuemax=""100"" style=""width: 0%;""></div> </div>   So, this is your basic HTML for your progress-bar. I added an attribute ""ID"" called ""mainProgressBar"" on the div .progress-bar. This is in this div which act as the ""filler"" of the progress div element, so this is this div which need to get the width changed from your JavaScript.  Here the JavaScript you will use on your update function (for example) :  // so, you take the attribute ID of the progress-bar element, then you add a custom CSS style on this element. You want to change the width of this element (because this is the filler). Then, you add your variable. $(""#mainProgressBar"").css('width', yourVariableValue);   But, if you setup everything nicely, you will encounter a small bug. By default, Bootstrap adds a transition on their progress-bar filler. So, you need in your custom CSS to add :  .progress-bar {     transition: none;     -o-transition: none;     -webkit-transition: none; }   and it will remove the small transition added by default by Bootstrap."

The formula for calculating the amount of time (in seconds) it takes to double a building is as follows:  p / (b * 2U+T )  Where p = building price, b = base production, U = production upgrades, and T = twin upgrades.  EDIT: Added parentheses"

incremental_games,3cy3i7,1234abcdcba4321,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:07:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is exponential growth. Ignoring larvae, if you wanted to double any meat unit in Swarm Simulator, it takes a constant amount of time to do so. If you have one queen producing 2 drones/s, it costs 100 drones to double that, so 50 seconds to double. Two queens produce 4 drones/s, costs 200 drones to double, so 50 seconds once again, and so on. The same rule applies to every meat unit (with different numbers of course).  How long it takes to double doesn't matter in terms of exponential growth; what matters is if the doubling time is constant no matter the numbers. Polynomial growth would see a reduced doubling time as time goes on, but that is not the case in Swarm Simulator.  Secondly, I'm not sure why it needs parentheses when the formula is mathematically correct."
incremental_games,3cy3i7,PSISP,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:02:16 2015 UTC,"Ah, but you're forgetting about larvae/interns. Your larvae/interns eventually become limited, and then you can't produce any more of the leading unit to increase your stuff.

Let's say that it takes 30 minutes for a bacterium to divide and produce two bacteria. It takes another 30 minutes for those two bacteria to produce four, and so on. However, the bacteria can not reproduce indefinitely; there are factors such as food, space, and predators that ultimately limit how large a population can grow. Regardless, a bacteria population is still said to have underwent exponential growth. The same applies to the meat units in Swarm Simulator. How large they can grow is limited on larvae, but it's still exponential growth.  And my bad. You're right about the parentheses."

incremental_games,3cy3i7,DrStochastic,2,Sun Jul 12 06:40:15 2015 UTC,"My intent was for Influence to be kind of resource which lets you conquer 'walls' and be kind of an active mechanic (you need to look at game from time to time to increase limit) since I don't really like clicking mechanics in incrementals, so going from e7 to e10 should feel like a bigger milestone than single Data upgrade.

Essentially, I'm using a button group for the nice, rounded corners on the whole block, but that comes with the downside of having to label the boxes as ""buttons"". I'll see what I can do to solve it.  That's actually a really good idea, splitting it into minion tiers. I'll get that down for the next round.   I want to expand the system somehow, but keep the simplicity of it intact. Figuring out how has proven really difficult. Particularly because I need to find the time as well, to write the many many lines of extra code. But it's certainly on the drawing board.  I haven't commented on the visuals. And I probably should. But I don't know what to say. I am graphically inept, and very attentive to details, which is often a bad cocktail.

incremental_games,3cvgjr,LJNeon,6,Sat Jul 11 02:47:23 2015 UTC,"What you're looking for is called ""Responsive Design."" It allows you to write different layouts targeting specific screen resolutions, no need for a separat app/website for mobile.  As /u/pickten said, the first step is writing every container dimensions as percentages. For example, if you have a sidebar and a main content area, instead of defining their width in terms of pixels (like 200px & 800px), you use percentages (25% & 75%). But this is only useful for desktop resolutions.  For narrower screens, you can use the so-called media queries in your CSS files to break down the layout. On smaller portrait-oriented mobile screen, you can for example put the sidebar under the main content. You can as well lower the font size, hide some elements, etc.  If you're already efficient in CSS, you can start off by reading some tutorials, like Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS - Responsive Web Design or Google's Make it responsive"

incremental_games,3cvgjr,TotomInc,4,Mon Jul 13 03:24:25 2015 UTC,"Hey,  I recommend you to take a look at browser display statistics, it will allow you to focus only on the most used resolutions.  Also, you can use a framework like Bootstrap, which is made to be responsive on all devices (mobile first!). Bootstrap is essentially made of media queries.  In Bootstrap, the div container is really simple, you have the container and container-fluid. You basically put all your content on this div. Here, you can see how it looks like with the .container and here with the .container-fluid. My screen resolution is 1920x1080.  Here an example of how a media queries are implemented in Bootstrap for the .container div :  @media (min-width: 768px) {   .container {     width: 750px;   } } @media (min-width: 992px) {   .container {     width: 970px;   } } @media (min-width: 1200px) {   .container {     width: 1170px;   } }   Hope it helps, if you need more informations or help, just ask!"

incremental_games,3cvgjr,khoitrinh,5,Mon Jul 13 03:26:06 2015 UTC,"My 2c - it's flat out not worth the extra hassle to make your (presumably) pet game work well across everything. Really good responsive design is hard, making a complex website work on mobiles is hard ... you'll end up spending just as long dealing with these as with building the game itself. Your time is much better spent working out if you have a decent game or not than making a dud work beautifully everywhere.   There are different solutions depending upon how much time/effort is going to go into a project:   tiny prototype - just make it run at a fixed resolution on one specific popular device/browser - you'll get enough feedback to work out if it's worth continuing the project small game - make it work for a wider variety of browsers or devices (say, all iPhones). Fixed resolution is still fine (all of Kongregate is effectively fixed resolution for instance) serious indie game - make it work on multiple platforms well, optimally from a common code base. I you start off in something that won't work on a target platform (like Flash > mobile) then you'll have to rebuild a lot of work. Only at this point is it really worth working about resolution independence and al the hassles that brings.  AAA game - build it in whatever the best solution is for the target platform, invest a lot of time in porting, have a team of people testing each platform, etc."

incremental_games,3cvgjr,astarsearcher,2,Mon Jul 13 03:28:14 2015 UTC,My screen resolution is 3200x1800.

incremental_games,3cs3iv,artificialsoup,2,Fri Jul 10 09:13:57 2015 UTC,"Your prototype is very simple, did you make this prototype to help you learn JS?  First, I really like this UI, it's so clean and you make a great use of Bootstrap! I can suggest you Bootswatch, they made free simple Bootstap theme.  I have some suggestions for your code :  Learn about jQuery. jQuery is so magic, you will get rid of that :  document.getElementById(""yourDivId"");   and instead got :  $(""#yourDivId"");   Then, if you want to change your cookies div text, you will get :  $(""#yourDivId"").html(""Cookies : "" + cookies);   which is better. jQuery also let you add/remove class/id on your div, add animations effect, etc. so easily!  It's not too hard to learn about jQuery, I mainly use their API documentation or sometimes I go to W3school for jQuery.  Hope it will help you, and if you have any question, you can ask me!  EDIT : Oh, yeah, I forgot one thing. Change your buttons attribute to :  <a class=""btn btn-default"" href=""#"" role=""button"" onclick=""yourCookiesEarnFunction()"">Your cookies earn button</a>   it will prevent people from pressing the ""enter"" key and earn cookies."
incremental_games,3cs3iv,TotomInc,2,Fri Jul 10 09:48:29 2015 UTC,"It's supposed to be as simple as possible. I didn't particularly create it to learn JS, but because my job requires a function be built that runs on a lot of the same principles as a clicker game, so it was to ease into that, that I made it.   I intentionally avoided using jQuery. because I wanted to do it in pure JS. I will at some point, rewrite most of it into the jquery library, I suppose.  In relation to your EDIT. Is it the ""type=""button"""" that's causing the ""enter to get a cookie"" problem?"
incremental_games,3cs3iv,TotomInc,2,Fri Jul 10 10:22:03 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's because you are using the  <button></button>   attribute.

incremental_games,3cs3iv,neurofluxation,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"I've thought about a prestige system ever since I began laying the first ""bricks"" onto the game, but I've yet to come up with a prestige system that is a bit more than ""2% bonus to all earning per n cookies reset""  Perhaps you have some ideas for something you'd like to see? Not necessarily balanced out or anything, but float it by me."
incremental_games,3cs3iv,neurofluxation,2,Fri Jul 10 17:31:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well, first off I think the idling features like minions should be way nerfed down and have more seperation between each other. Instead of going from the Imp that costs 20 to the Troll who costs 100, it should go from the Imp that costs 20 to the Troll who costs 400 to the Witch who costs 2,600.   Also the cookies per tick on each minion is kind of wonky. Try making linear. Like the Imp makes 1 per tick, Troll makes 4, Witch makes 16, Ogre makes 64, and so on. As I said before, you would need way greater seperation in price before this.  Also, I think the tick length should be down to 1% or else you should increase the price multiplier for it way more.  Anyways, the prestige system, I was thinking something different... What I was thinking could be cool is have seperate cookies. Now you have the casual cookie that you start off clicking. Once you get your tick length down to 500 ms, you are able to buy a sugar cookie button for let's say 50,000 cookies. Now with sugar cookies, you can trade like 5,000 regular cookies for 1 sugar cookie. With sugar cookies you now unlock the ability to buy a 20% minion multiplier for 10 sugar cookies.   This can go on, and there could be an exchange to sell 1,000 sugar cookies for 1 chocolate chip cookie which unlocks further minions that now give you sugar cookies per tick (which are extremely nerfed, for example, 25 chocolate chip cookies price for a minion that makes 5 sugar cookies per second)  And finally, you can exchange 25,000 chocolate chip cookies for 1 vortex cookie. You can choose when you want to sell your vortex cookie(s) and each one will reset everything and give you a 5% overall boost, and unlock new upgrades like slightly decreasing the exchange rate for regular cookie > sugar cookie and from sugar cookie > chocolate chip cookie and chocolate chip cookie > vortex cookie that you buy with vortex cookies themselves.  Excuse me, my imagination ran wild with this one haha, don't overload yourself with all of it, just focus on the balancing from the first couple of paragraphs before. I'm sure my prestige idea would be very hard to do."
incremental_games,3cs3iv,neurofluxation,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:19:30 2015 UTC,"I like the concept of it though. Increasing the multipliers you can achieve seems to be what will hold the game together in the ""late-game"" (excuse my language), so I'll want to do something along those lines. And your idea is really good.  As for the minions, there are a lot of conflicting opinions on it. Certainly I agree with your point about nerfing the tick rate. I've nerfed it 4-5 times already (which only affects new users and later upgrades), but it needs more, absolutely.   EDIT: I've nerfed the tick rate to a 1% reduction over a 2% one."

One thing I've noticed though is that the gray tiles that are behind the buttons are also clickable. Is that intended?"
incremental_games,3cs3iv,1234abcdcba4321,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:28:41 2015 UTC,It's not necessarily intentional. It's a byproduct of the Bootstrap btn-group style I used to set them up the way they are. I'm looking for a better solution to it.
incremental_games,3cs3iv,1234abcdcba4321,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:18:10 2015 UTC,100 clicks for the first generator is way too much.

incremental_games,3cs3iv,muchsexyandy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:25:07 2015 UTC,I've lowered it to 25 for the unlock and 25 for the imp. So 50 total.
incremental_games,3cs3iv,muchsexyandy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:42:02 2015 UTC,"I still think that's a bit too much. Kittens Game is 10+1 clicks for the first generator, Cookie Clicker is 15+1 clicks for the first generator. Some people like clicking the same button hundreds of times, but personally I think that's a surefire way to get RSI, and I don't want that."
incremental_games,3cs3iv,muchsexyandy,2,Fri Jul 10 12:57:22 2015 UTC,"Well, we're talking 50 clicks to set you up. But let me hear what you'd suggest instead then."
incremental_games,3cs3iv,1234abcdcba4321,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:09:38 2015 UTC,"If there's only a single button, at most 20 clicks for the first generator. If there are multiple ""stages"", like in Universe-God, 100 clicks can be okay, if they're distributed over multiple concepts. I think that the clicker game concept is slowly being replaced by the idle game concept (cf. Swam Simulator)."
incremental_games,3cqlph,Brownprobe,6,Fri Jul 10 00:00:08 2015 UTC,"Hey guys! I'm pretty close to having my game Trimps to a stable point, but I have played the game so many times that I can't trust the way that it feels to me anymore.   I spent a good amount of time working on it this week, and I would really love any and all feedback that you have. I'm especially looking for constructive feedback and am going to be doing nothing but bugfixes (as they come out, I have taken care of everything that I know of) and balance tweaks, and I will be able to push balance changes to the server now without breaking saves (I really really hope).  I put the game on github as well, so it's all open source and stuff, and has a link that actually stands a chance of being remembered. This is the server that I'll be hosting the game on for the foreseeable future.  Here's what's new, and the game lives at http://trimps.github.io  Apologies in advance if anything is messed up, but just let me know and I'll fix it.  Btw, if you're playing, save and refresh every once and a while, because I will be fixing things. You can copy your export string first just to be safe, and I can fix it if something goes wrong, but these should all be pretty safe on the saves."
incremental_games,3cqlph,jamosup,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:41:30 2015 UTC,"is it intentional for the price of the ""prestige"" upgrades to explode so violently? i haven't played since before the maps even existed, so i don't know what it was like, but I bought the upgrade for dagger III and it went from costing 50k or so metal to give 14 damage to costing 20 million to give 77 damage, essentially bricking that upgrade slot for a long time. considering greatsword 3 gives 60 attack and only costs 100k metal after already having upgraded it to level 5, maybe something bugged out with the scaling, or something isn't clear?  it's fine if I'm doing it wrong and they're meant to be after you've bought a -lot- of upgrades and they are becoming extremely inefficient, but you unlock them so fast it feels like the scaling is off. similarly, once I bought the special block upgrade from world 10, the price of shields jumped to 247k wood, and I ended up buying shield III and making it shoot all the way up to 2 billion wood. but for some reason, I could still buy one upgrade of it after I got a certain amount of wood - is there a display error?  the balance otherwise is enjoyable, I'm at world 12 so far and not hitting too many walls, sometimes taking a break to explore maps. it feels like the resource drops from maps scale super slowly, to the point it's far more profitable to keep an old map around where I can oneshot everything rather than do new and challenging ones, and even then, the drops aren't great.   i'm liking the game a lot, just making sure if some of these things are balance decisions I'm not picking up on or major bugs with the scaling."
incremental_games,3cqlph,Brownprobe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:44:55 2015 UTC,"No. This was actually a pretty bad bug, but I just fixed it. It was incorrectly calculating the values when prestiging the item, but it was resetting them to the correct values after refreshing so I never caught it."
incremental_games,3cqlph,jamosup,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:53:39 2015 UTC,"alright, nice. after saving and refreshing, the shield III with block is down to 303k wood and the dagger 3 is down to 250k metal, which is far more reasonable. thanks for the qucik response!"

incremental_games,3cqlph,jamosup,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:39:51 2015 UTC,"same; I forgot to mention this. I can at least recycle it if i go in and then exit (since then I have to complete it or recycle), but otherwise the button doesn't work, making clearing out unsatisfactory maps tedious. i assume this is a bug, though I do think recycling maps should have a confirmation, as maps from earlier worlds are technically irreplacable."

incremental_games,3cqlph,jamosup,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:22:03 2015 UTC,"one more inquiry: is the generation on the resource types of maps bugged or biased towards something? 80% of the maps I get have metal as the resource, and 18% have food; finding a single wood map can take dozens of attempts, let alone a good one. is it related to my setup of workers or which resource I'm actively gathering? I have many more miners than other workers."
incremental_games,3cqlph,Brownprobe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"It's random, and based on the name of the map. There are definitely more metal maps right now because I feel like metal is the most needed one. I think it's fun having the other ones be a little more rare though, and there are so many fragments in the late game that you can spam maps if you're looking for something. All of this stuff is still open to change, I just kinda have to get a feel for how people are playing the new one. Nobody plays like I play the game so it's hard for me to balance, lol"
incremental_games,3cqlph,jamosup,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"metal is definitely the most needed, and it's mainly just me wanting one of every map when I start doing them. still, it could be toned down a little (possibly a 4:2:1 metal:food:wood ratio instead of what feels like a 20:4:1 ratio). also, is there a map fragment sink? i'm at world 18, so i'm not sure what upgrades are left, but it seems odd that I have 23k fragments and no way to spend them all. unless there's an upgrade later (which i wouldn't want spoiled), there could be something after getting explorers that allows you to spend extra fragments to get maps with more potential or unique effects (things like higher difficulty/loot ratings, multiple resources in the same map, maps with a higher or lower level than your current world) as even five explorers gives you essentially infinite fragments after a minute or two.  one more suggestion: if it's not too difficult, would it be possible to add a feature in the future that allows you to ""lock"" a map, preventing recycling? when i'm going through maps trying to find the best ones, I'm worried I'll accidentally recycle ones I'm saving."
incremental_games,3cqlph,Brownprobe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:56:54 2015 UTC,"In the next content update, I'm planning on adding a choice for creating a map, where you can spend extra fragments to get better maps. So they will be more useful eventually. As for right now, once you get the explorers you can pretty much just have fun making maps and experimenting with them and what not.  I'll add the lock feature to my list of to do stuff, thanks for the suggestion!"
incremental_games,3cqlph,VirtuosiMedia,9,Sun Jul 12 20:18:23 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since my last update, but I wanted to let everyone know that Junction Gate is still in development. I just pushed out a minor release today aimed at extending gameplay a bit while I work on the beta, which is still a few months away. If anyone is curious, you can follow updates for the beta in the Dev Diary thread on r/junctiongate. I'll try to have some news roughly once a week to check out, though some weeks might be skipped or delayed by the nature of what I'm working on. Keep an eye on the thread's flair to see the last date it was updated and if you have any questions or feedback, let me know below."
incremental_games,3cqlph,fishtastic,2,Fri Jul 10 01:45:49 2015 UTC,"Played for about 30 minutes. I really like the user interface. Some suggestions.   Is there a good reason that new populations are always idling? Why not always assign them to work on something like mining? Credit can go over the 1000 limit. I had >4000/1000. Maybe a bug? I really like the user interface. The way you did the planet picture on the background is really cool. It does get a little repetitive after sometime. The game takes a lot of CPU, is it because of the planet on the background? I am running it on Firefox on a laptop with i5, CPU hits about 30~40%"
incremental_games,3cqlph,VirtuosiMedia,3,Fri Jul 10 07:22:36 2015 UTC,"Hey fishtastic, thanks for the feedback.    You can assign them manually after you unlock the ability to do so. The ""in-game"" reason why they aren't assigned automatically is that each sleeper needs recovery time. That's not a bug, but the UI has an inconsistency issue there. The ""limit"" in the case of credits is actually your insurance cap. If you get attacked, your credits won't dip below that number. The other resource limits are actually limits, but I need to find a better way to differentiate between the two types. Or at least a better label. Thanks! The beta will have a more engaging interface. The background will be better too, but will largely remain the same as the game mostly takes place in the interface. In a perfect world, I'd love to have a full immersive 3D environment a la Mass Effect/Star Citizen, but that's a little more than I'd care to tackle by myself. ;) Still, you can see some early screenshots of the differences between the current version and the beta in the dev diary thread and I'll be posting more as time goes on. Firefox does seem to run a bit slower than Chrome. During and after the beta, I'll be looking at performance quite a bit to make sure that there is a good experience for as many people as possible and will probably look into web workers as well. There is an option to disable the background animation in Log->Game Settings, which might help it some. The game also does do a lot of processing, though. It basically calculates all the resources earned, supply and demand in the economy, all the stock changes, trade routes, ship movement, research progress, and all faction moves like stock activity, diplomatic responses, budget allocation, and military moves. Depending on your game speed, it could be doing most of those items several times a second."
incremental_games,3cqlph,fishtastic,3,Fri Jul 10 08:07:49 2015 UTC,"I turned off the animation on Firefox and the CPU usage dropped from ~30% to less than 10!  For the Credit UI, I think it might be better to just not show the ""/1000 insurance cap"" part at all. In this game called ""Tribal Wars"", there is a building that can protects your resource from attacks. The amount that is protected is only shown on the upgrade screen. I don't think that number is important enough to be shown on the main screen."
incremental_games,3cqlph,VirtuosiMedia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:03:32 2015 UTC,"That might be a good solution for the UI, I'll keep that in mind for the beta. And thanks for sharing the animation stats. I'm going to have to find a less intensive way to do that."
incremental_games,3cqlph,Zebezian,2,Fri Jul 10 10:09:49 2015 UTC,Just tried the game yesterday. Holy moley. It's a lot of fun. I don't even know if I want to get sucked in to all the stuff that can be done. I might not have any free time left. I can only wonder how newer releases will change the game.

incremental_games,3cqlph,dSolver,5,Fri Jul 10 22:36:23 2015 UTC,"Project Name: The Workshop (but currently named dSolver's Workshop because the original name is too ambiguous)  Link: http://workshop.ga  FAQ   What is it: As it stands right now, it is a directory/listing of incremental games with the ability for members to review, and to have discussions about games. What I hope it will be: With enough members, I am hoping to turn it into an actual workshop where people can share ideas, help each other build projects, and yes - even have them hosted on site for those who can't afford their own webhost and don't want to use github pages. Who's funding it?: Me. There is a small banner ad near the bottom of the site only visible to people who are not members (hint hint, sign up to not have to see ads) Why do I have to sign up?: You don't, you can absolutely just lurk without signing up, but if you want to participate in discussions and review games, you'll want to. How do I sign up?: There's actually a few options. One is to create an account the traditional way: email, username, the whole shebang. Alternatively, and this is a lot more popular AFAIK, is sign in through one of: Reddit, Google+, GitHub, or Steam. Eventually I'll get around to adding more, but for the time being Logging on with Facebook or Twitter is expressly off-limits because I don't want to supply them with my personal cellphone number. How do I add a game? how do I edit a game?: You will need to be marked as a contributor. If you want to be one, please let me know! (Also helpful if you give me your username so I know who to make a contributor). Once added as a contributor, you will still need to log out and log back in to have the permissions applied as some people have experienced. This may be a caching issue, but low on priority list. Why does it look so weird?: Well, I think the future is in responsive websites with low bandwidth usage. Also, I've only been working on it for 2 weeks, much improvements will be had. It doesn't look weird, it looks great!: Thank you! But it is going to look differently over time, so... just hope for the best? I'd love suggestions posted to /r/dWorkshop Why not do X?: Before asking why the site isn't just like some other site, consider why the other site does what it does. Does that feature sound like something that would fit in here? If it does, go ahead and ask! If you're unsure, or the answer is no, suggest it, and we'll see. Who's this we you're talking about?: Oh yeah, the best part for all you inquisitive developers, this project will be open source. As in, I want it to be, but it's not quite stable enough to be open source while I'm still tinkering with a whole bunch of sensitive parts that it would be easier without a bunch of pull requests. What's with all the tags?: Well, while the workshop is focusing on incremental games right now, we will be opening it up to all web games soon enough. These tags are added for future usage.   List of known bugs   If you're uploading an image greater than 500kb, it won't warn you, it just won't upload. There is no field for the creator of the game. This is intentional - creators will have their own table, and each game's creator must match up to an existing creator, and that part is not ready yet. For the time being, if you feel it is important, stick it in the description field so that the game will show up when somebody searches for a certain creator. Discussions are opening in a modal on the same screen. Some of you may go wtf, that's stupid. Some of you won't care. As for me, it's opening on the same page for the time being so that you're not losing the context of the game when you move away from the discussion. If you really want it to be in a new screen, there's an icon to open it up in a new tab (after you've opened it, it's stupid I know, but I implemented it just last night, while braindead) This site will have major issues on all IEs, and older Firefox/Chrome versions. This will get better over time, but for now, while I don't have IE on my dev machine, making it available for IE users is low on the priority list"
incremental_games,3cqlph,VirtuosiMedia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:23:17 2015 UTC,"After editing Junction Gate's entry, I have a little feedback:   It would be nice to have dedicated links for Twitter and Facebook along with the subreddit. I also found myself wanting a short description field for the search listing and a longer one for the actual page. Image captions would also be nice to have. I tried updating the version number, but it didn't seem to stick. When clicking the ""Update"" button, I expected the editing modal to save and then close. It was a little confusing when it didn't appear to do anything. I had to clear my cache to see the updated logo on the listings page.   Those few things aside, this is fantastic work for two weeks and I hope it really takes off!"
incremental_games,3cqlph,dSolver,3,Fri Jul 10 20:00:44 2015 UTC,"I'll try to answer as much as I can:  Twitter/Facebook - absolutely, they will be added. There is also support for multiple links (going to google play, app store, etc) - but the UI is not quite ready yet.  Short description vs long description - what is the particular need? Just something shorter that goes in the listing?  Image captions - not there yet. Eventually images would have the same treatment as discussions - where comments are enabled, but not quite there yet.  Version number not updating? I'll look into it.  Update button - not save and closing the modal? That's very strange - I will have to look into it, it's working as expected on me (firefox and chrome on mac book).  Clearing cache to see updated logo on listings page - ok, I can make this one work a bit better, I haven't thought about updating it there for the most part."
incremental_games,3cqlph,VirtuosiMedia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:09:18 2015 UTC,"The short vs long description request was pretty much that, I just wanted to expand on the game description a bit, but didn't want to clog up the listings page with a wall of text.  For the update button, I'm on Windows 8.1 and Chrome Version 43.0.2357.132 m, if that helps.  Edit: So I just tried editing the version number again with my dev tools open (and it clears the cache automatically too). Both the update button and saving the version number worked this time now. I didn't see any errors in the console, so maybe it's a cache thing? It definitely didn't work about a half hour ago."
incremental_games,3cqlph,dSolver,2,Fri Jul 10 20:20:36 2015 UTC,"hmmm, darn, I can't test because I don't have windows 8.1 (not that the windows version should matter) - in any case, I'll log it somewhere. My best guess is that you were updating it the exact moment I was updating the server code, which slows it down, and you might have gotten a 500 error, which I haven't made a UI change to handle yet."

incremental_games,3cnb6r,fishtastic,3,Thu Jul 9 06:06:17 2015 UTC,Stat points on level up seems to be missing. I am no longer able to increase stats on level up.
incremental_games,3cnb6r,SomeUniqueRandomName,3,Thu Jul 9 07:27:01 2015 UTC,"Glad you noticed! Thank you for keeping track with the updates.  One of the changes for this update was to make leveling is approximately 2x faster. In exchange, you only get 1 stat point and it's distributed semi randomly.  After some heavy play testing, I decided that this is a better design.   It adds variance to the game play It simplifies the game play since you no longer need to click on inventory and distribute stat points on each level. Doing this for each level was tedious. You don't need to decide between going ""STR-build"" or ""INT-build"". This makes more skills useful, which adds complexity to the combat system. Before, if you are going for a STR build and find a really good INT spell, you won't get to use it. This change will make most skills usable throughout the game."
incremental_games,3cnb6r,jayseesee85,4,Thu Jul 9 07:42:35 2015 UTC,"Not sure I agree with it.  I liked being able to pick a build and go for it.  This is kind of a forced hybrid.  Granted, I enjoyed hybrid when I tried it last patch, but this just removes choice from the player, which can make the game feel more diluted.  Interesting options to assist this along could be:    Items that work on the higher of Str/Int. Better shop logic to offer a Support/Int/Str skill for each cabin. A way to ensure that certain skill books always show up. Logic to detect which is higher, Str or Int, and favor those kinds of books.   It IS an interesting concept, but could use some tweaking.  Not personally a fan, but it is different, and different can be good.  I'll be eager to see where you go from here with it."
incremental_games,3cnb6r,jayseesee85,5,Thu Jul 9 12:27:23 2015 UTC,"Lengthy reply about game balance. Some story first, then my idea on what to do next.  In the very first version of the game, Player received 2 stat points on each level and they could use it freely. Turned out it is always optimal to pick either INT or STR build, since your damage will be doubled essentially. The problem was that, half of the skills from shops became useless since you have no stat for it.  To address this, in version 1.02, players only receive a single stat point per level and the other stat point is distributed randomly between STR or INT. This didn't exactly solve the issue, since a player would still have to choose between INT or STR build at some point. Leading to the same issue. Also, since leveling is fast in Small Island. There is this tedious chore of going to inventory to spend your stat points on each level.  So in 1.03, I decided to kill stat points entirely, distribution was 25% chance INT, 25% chance STR, 12.5% chance to get other ones. As you have pointed out here, this diluted the gameplay. Which is definitely NOT what I wanted! Even if it made more shop skills useful :(  I would say my ultimate goal here is to make the game more interesting and add replayability. Players should have choices on their character build. Which means what I got so far is NOT good enough.  From your suggestions above, I could create new skills that scales on the higher of INT/STR, but in that case it's still better to put all stat in one (to maximize damange). Changing shop logic to always offer Support/Int/Str skill would take randomness away from the game making it more predictable, which I think would make the game boring.    After some thinking, I arrived at this conclusion.   There is simply not enough options in the game. Right now, players pretty much have to go with either STR or INT build.   I think this caused the game to have little replayability, and that is very bad.  To solve this, my proposal is to change existing skills, and add news skills to scales off other stats. Instead making all damage scale off INT and STR, make them scale off a good mix of all stats.   This will add more build options including a better hybrid build. If you focus on one stat (say STR only), you will have trouble against enemies with high physical resistance. If you spread your stat out, you get more options but might not do as much damage against specific enemies. This, in combination with stores selling random skills, enemies having various mix of strength of weakness, should make the game a lot more interesting.    Details and Possible Skills  Lightning attacks will scale off WIL instead of INT. e.g. Lightning bolt: Deal WIL x 1.5 damage to target.  Fast attack will scale heavily off SPD. e.g. Quick Attack: Deal SPD + STR x 0.5 damage to target.  Add restriction to skills e.g. Haste: Increase your action speed by 50% for 10 seconds. You need 20 SPD or higher to use this skill. e.g. Backstab: Deal STR x 2 damage to target ignoring all defense. If your SPD is lower than target's SPD, do no damage instead. e.g. Focus: For 10 seconds, whenever you take an action, your INT is considered to be 20% higher. You need 20 WIL or higher to use this skill.  Change scaling for elemental attacks to STR off other other stat. STR should just be physical damage. e.g. Charged Blade Atk: Deal WIL + STR x 0.5 lightning damage to target.  Heal and defensive skills is based on VIT e.g. Heal: Gain HP equal to VIT x 2 e.g. Defensive Stance: For 10 seconds, whenever you would receive physical damage, reduce that damage by VIT.   Themes I have in mind right now.  STR: Normal and Strong physical attack INT: Fire and Water elementalal spells WIL: Elemental defense, lightning spells, offensive buffs SPD: Action speed, fast and timing based attacks that can bypass defense. VIT: Physical defense, heal spells, defensive buffs RES: RES adds unnecessary complexity, planning to remove RES next version.   There will also be skills that require a mix of two stats, hopefully allowing different builds with various pros and cons.  e.g.    STR + INT: High damage, good against many enemy types. Low defense   STR + SPD: Fast physical attacks. Weak against high physical defense enemy.   INT + WIL: Full mage build, high damage, many spells to pick from, low defense and HP. etc. etc.   Would like to hear some thoughts on this, since it's going to be a pretty big change."
incremental_games,3cnb6r,jayseesee85,3,Fri Jul 10 06:03:59 2015 UTC,"As a devout min-maxer, my first reaction is knee-jerk nonononono =P  But I'm weighing everything.  Again, you seem to be going for something different, so I'll take that in mind, while in most games, full one-stat builds are welcomed and celebrated, I can tell that's not what you are going for.  I think your plan can work, and I'd give it a test most certainly.  I can't really back the whole restriction to skills.  Perhaps rather than a restriction, less effectiveness, either half, or scaling?  Never lock a player out of an option 100%, that's just not fun for the player.  Also, I'm not sure how I feel about a straight same-stat compare ala backstab, but we'll see how things go.  If you are going to diversify all stats and make multiple builds of 1+1 viable, choice may need to come back too, but I think you mentioned that.    While having a decent spread in the shop may take away randomness, I think especially if every stat gets its own spells that there needs to be a way to get those into a players hands semi-reliably.  I remember from FTL games that nothing sucked more than hoping for a few decent weapon drops and getting nothing but garbage for most of the game.  Really crushed some runs and made me feel like I was more playing a RNG sim and not an actual game.  All and all, I definitely like the idea of diversifying the stats, making them all attractive.  Freedom and complexity of choice do WONDERS to add replayability to games, so I look forward to seeing what you do."
incremental_games,3cnb6r,Morkyl,2,Fri Jul 10 10:20:33 2015 UTC,"FTL is one of my favourite game! While I do think FTL is a extremely well-balanced game, I do agree that often times, the RNG just has too much influence on the game.  I plan to bring back the choice of stat point distribution for next update. Again, another major design change. Hopefully it will make the game better.  I definitely understand the issue on not being able to get certain items reliably. This is a game balance problem. Keep it too predictable - game is boring, make it too random - player loses control. My aim is to keep the influence of RNG at a similar, perhaps a bit lower level of what FTL is offering.  I think the restriction on skill is something that will be necessary for balancing skill power. If a player gets a powerful skill early on (say: Inferno, deal 30 + INT fire damage to all), this will make early game too easy. I think it's better to bar the player from using it so that   If the players wants to learn that skill. They will need to save up stat points and put them all in INT, which makes the player weak in other fronts. If the player doesn't want to learn the skill, the player can sell the tome, (and buy potions or something) making early game easier.   Anyhow, skill diversification is coming. I think it's the right direction for next update."
incremental_games,3cnb6r,Morkyl,2,Fri Jul 10 21:31:48 2015 UTC,"(say: Inferno, deal 30 + INT fire damage to all)   My question to you is, why require something with such a hefty flat +?  Increase the stat multiplier instead.  Maybe 5xInt or (Int+3)*2 or something along those lines.  I run into the issue where the flat X+Stat attacks have generally always outperformed most others for a long time.     With a higher multiplier, if someone gets the skill early, great, it's not doing much for them compared to a focused build.  Then again, that could eventually bloat out of control.  Maybe a logarithmic progression instead of a linear?  Even so, something to think on.  Ultimately your decision, and I'll give it a try no matter what :)  Can't wait to see how it goes.  Definitely enjoyed what you have put out so far."
incremental_games,3cnb6r,jamosup,2,Fri Jul 10 21:52:00 2015 UTC,"For now, damage formula are generally in the form of   Deal (X + INT * Y) damage OR  Deal (INT * X) or (STR * Y) damage. whichever is lower/higher.   I think these formula are easy for most people to understand.   Ideally, if I want better balance control I would go with formulas full of exponents and logarithms. Except those formula are quite complicated. If item descriptions look like   ""Fire ball: Deal 5 + 2 x log_base1.5(INT) damage to target"" ""Better Fire ball: Deal 2 x log_base1.4(INT) damage to target""   Most players won't have a clue what the damage would be just by looking at them.  Again, tricky balance issue. Gonna work out some math :/"
incremental_games,3cnb6r,jayseesee85,3,Fri Jul 10 22:30:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with Jayseesee85 about what you're proposing. Could be awesome, could be terrible. We won't really know till we try it, but whatever you do we will try it :D  I would like to add some suggestions that I think would help balance the rest of the game out as well.  One thing to keep in mind about most incremental/idle games with ""prestige"" is that they are designed to make the game's next run a bit easier/more productive. Tokens currently do nothing to make the next play-through enjoyable. So far I've never even seen one of the skills they supposedly unlock. I would rather see tokens do something like add passive skills that you can customize each playthrough, refunding them and adding what you've gained each new game. Things that modify the bonuses of stats such as:   Hungry Adventurer: Boosts the health returned after killing a monster by 1 per vit point. Sorcerous Knowledge: Reduces mana consumption of spells by 1/3rd of their original cost. Greedy Fingers: You now somehow find an extra 25% gold when looting slain monsters. Critical Defense: Anytime you receive damage, there is a 5% chance that damage will be reduced to 1. Spellshield: Every point of will now gives a 1 point damage reduction against elemental attacks.   Some would cost more tokens to activate, and what would be cool is to have elite passive skills (classes) that do not return the tokens at the end of the game, but they cost more and you can only choose one per play-through:   Warrior: All physical attacks now have a 33% boost to their damage, and basic attack is improved (6 dmg + STR). Alchemist: All health and mana restore items now restore twice the amount and you're more likely to find them after a battle. Acrobat: Your speed is boosted by 33%, and for every 10 points of speed you have a 10% chance to attack twice in one round. Also movement on the map is increased by 25%. Boss Tamer: Upon defeating a boss, you now gain both of the skill/statbooks instead of choosing only one. There is also a 2% chance that you will find a skillbook at the end of a battle.   (BTW, please fix boss loots so duplicate options do not occur)  There's so many different things you can do with that. Now earning tokens would mean something, which means people want to replay to try out the different combinations and unlock new, more expensive and more epic passives.  Also I would like to see it so that completed battle nodes have cool-down timers of something like Base Monster Lvl * 1.5 minutes, at which point they would become available to run again. They would also reward a lower amount of experience like (Base Monster Level / Player Level) so if you're level 5 and you go back to Battle 1, each monster will only reward 20% of the original experience, continuing to diminish as the player levels up.  I would also like to see traders change their wares every now and then. Say every 5-10 minutes or even once an hour. This would alleviate giving them more stock, and also the grief it causes players who get poor selections for the build they're after."
incremental_games,3cnb6r,jayseesee85,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"Some really good ideas here.  I think the system where you get reusable tokens and being able to spend them on bonuses is a fantastic idea. That way, I can make the game difficult yet still allow less skilled players to complete it eventually. Another bonus of that is I can kill ""Easy Mode"" completely with this change. Easy mode was an unnecessary feature.  Regarding the idea where monsters would replenish, and merchants would restock every 5-10 minutes. I think refilling areas with monster/items is a good idea, but it shouldn't be time based. Small Island has idle mechanics, but idling should not make the game easier. If a player can grind on easy area, even at 1/5 EXP, some will do it. That I think that would make the game boring.  I think your prestige system is better than what I have so far. I will give it a try and see how well it works out.  Duplicate boss loot will be fixed!"
incremental_games,3cnb6r,1234abcdcba4321,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:05:30 2015 UTC,"I really want to like this game, but this random stat distribution is making it difficult. My last play-through left me with a ton of res but little of much else, so I was constantly weak, running out of mana, and resorting to using potions just to beat one enemy. I find res to be useless in it's current state, as spell-throwers still manage to wreck me even with large amounts of it.  A previous play-through the game favored str and wis, which was awesome and allowed me to use my fiery-blade skill constantly without running out of mana and I rarely needed to use potions. This indicates to me that there's a large imbalance in the practicality of stats, and that the randomness of stat distribution can either make or break a play-through...  It would be nice if there was a fairly early location that you could visit that would allow you to respec one stat point at a time for a reasonable sum of gold, removing one of your choice and allowing you to distribute it where you want it to be."

incremental_games,3cnb6r,MasterYinan,3,Thu Jul 9 08:10:47 2015 UTC,"Ran through for a win.  It felt a lot easier than past iterations.  This may be due to the faster leveling, enemy modifiers for increased gold, and other factors.  Fire weakness is horribly over-represented.  I lucked out with Fire Blade, Fire Ball and Inferno as well, which made most fights a cakewalk.  Supplemented with an early Water Blade for the few mobs/bosses that aren't fire weak and it was a cakewalk.  Loving the new Elemental Blade skills.  Didn't see the eyes or other critters that were phys weak from past.  Could have been the generation though, I don't know enough about that.  Only ever found one lightning attack, and that was RIGHT near the end of the game.  Didn't need it, but still, odd.  Overall enjoyable, very fun little 20-30 minute RPG.  Randomization/token system seems like replayability may be good too.  Remains to be seen.  As mentioned elsewhere, not a fan of forced-random stat distribution, but with a potential future gear system/other tweaks, could be doable.  It certainly is different from some games.  Also, I like the depleting mob pools, forces progression/smart play.  I did miss a bit unlocking say, L28 while on 5 for self-imposed challenges, but the linear level opening WAS something that was kind of needed.  Edit: Could use 1-0 or -/= hotkeys too."

Letting anybody edit it may be the whole point of a wiki, but as it stands, we don't have enough contributors to roll back damage easily; it's too risky. The karma limit blocks freshly-made troll accounts, but doesn't do any more screening.  That said, the most practical way of going about this is if you have both a karma limit and an approval process (that is, either one of the two can be met in order to edit). That way lurkers can get in, troll accounts get blocked (for the most part), and regular users don't have to wait to be approved."

E.g. the ""+1"" when you upvote something in this reddit or ""+1 castle"" in Sandcastle Builder. Do it mostly with Javascript? CSS? How do you effectively limit the number floating items (browser performance)?"
incremental_games,3chnu9,pickten,3,Wed Jul 8 14:44:17 2015 UTC,"lol I've been spending a lot of time lately trying to improve the code that handles that in sandcastle builder, actually. (trying to collapse identical notifications without breaking it completely, which seems to happen a lot)  Here's how it works:  First, you define some sort of array (SB calls it sParticles) in the javascript. It should prolly be of a length equal to the max allowable numbers onscreen. Each element will be an object that contains the following data: x-coord, y-coord, life, and text. x-coord is where it will be horizontally, y is where it'll be vertically, life is how much longer it should last (SB defaults this to -1 to indicate that it's not present at all), and text is what it says.  Next, in the same for loop that you probably should use to make this array, or in another one if needbe, create a string that will create a bunch of <div>s to represent your notifications.  Now you have your basics. Use a bit of jQuery majicks to pop that into existence somewhere as a bunch of divs with a special class for your notifications.  Next, create a function to update your notifications, which does the following:   if life==-1, don't do anything. Otherwise: update the x/y coords as it should move (suggestion: track fps for this!) increment life. If the life now exceeds the max life (probably should be based on fps, again), reset the life to -1 and hide it.   Finally, create a function to change your notifications. When pushing, you should avoid changing the length of your notifications thing if possible, because that causes problems. SB's takes the first one with life==-1 if possible, and the oldest if not.  Then, of course, you want to style the text to look fancy, but that's easier to do."

incremental_games,3cjgzb,KeinNiemand,2,Wed Jul 8 11:43:00 2015 UTC,"Frankly, if you want big numbers, I'd suggest you write the library yourself to suit your needs (edit: don't write arbitrary precision ones if that's what you're going for; just write it if it's approximation-based). I'm developing my own game ATM, and the full thing took about a day's work (not counting testing/bugfixing) despite my relative lack of js skill.   I'm not very familiar with Unity, but if you use js (javascript), I'd suggest the following:   If you have any js experience, dive right in. Otherwise, start Codecademy. Don't take it too seriously b/c it's not great, but it does teach the basics. Once you know how to do basic math, looping, arrays, objects, and functions, start working. Use w3schools after that if you need more help, because it's a very good reference tool. For html/css, use codecademy to learn the absolute basics (making it exist, adding elements, id, class, buttons), then use w3 for all your reference needs. Use jQuery. Don't worry if you don't know it, it's extremely easy to learn once you have a basic grasp of html/css. I learned all I need from w3 in a few hours (from scratch, with a bad understanding of html/css). An incremental is relatively simple to code. You should probably begin with any math you might need, then add some sort of upgrade prototype (and a few actual upgrades), then more stuff as you see fit."
incremental_games,3cjgzb,pickten,3,Wed Jul 8 15:13:42 2015 UTC,"Writing your own library is terrible advice!!  You want to make a game, not a big number libraries, so doing it will take a good chunk of time and effort. Also, these libraries have a myriad of little details that you are bound to overlook, and will cause you problems later. Third party libraries are (usually) widely used, tested and supported, which helps you to focus on what you really want (making a game).  Making your own library only makes sense when there is nothing available and it is absolutely necessary for you. Even in those instances, is better to take an existing library and modify it to suit your needs (like I would like to do with decimal.js)."

After all, the game started in browser and then got an app.  Now on topic, i love this game, the humour is just stupid, the progression can be fast paced, but also completely afked. there's no real punishment for playing it totally ZPG style not even using the remote control, but there are rewards for being active and controling your hero and his actions.  On the Donation side, the game doesn't seem to be pay to win at all, since most of the times that charges can get you any advantage, it's only up to 2-3 charges, and even then everyone else can have that number easily. Paying only makes the grind a little faster, not even worth mentioning to be honest, but some people is bound to complain, since the game does have a multiplayer side to it. About multiplayer, it's more or less 2 parts, PvM duo, or PvP Arena, if you ever want to use any of those 2 events, you will have to manually instruct your hero to do so (Except with bosses, those can spawn randonmly sometimes), making it possible to be 100% single player too.  For the goal, you can set your goal any of the set goals they already have, be it become a Guild leader, completing the temple, building a store, train your pet to a high level, be the strongest duelist of the season, etc.  To me, a 10/10 game.

CivCrafter felt very pay to win to really get anywhere, and even with the gold you get from this game, it doesn't really help. I am making progress on CivMiner without paying real money in the form of passing a few bosses per day and seeing a few new ores per day. I hope they update this game and keep it fresh."

Canvas has the advantage of being fairly flexible, so you could say build your entire tree in canvas and just have that DOM element, which would interact with your game. You'll want to read the Canvas API to know if it's for you.  Having said that, if you don't mind going a little more heavy-weight, D3.js is an excellent library for making graphs, and in your case, a flow-chart in javascript. There's a bit of a learning curve, but not much more than learning how to use canvas."

incremental_games,3cba2l,Psychemaster,2,Mon Jul 6 15:51:37 2015 UTC,"Hi, great game!  Minor suggestion, which should be easy to implement - when I upgrade a generic armor or weapon, and get the popup to give it a name and flavor text, if I don't enter anything, it would be nice to have one of the default ones get picked automatically.  Also, for whatever reason, I've managed to get some kind of broken debuff that is spamming up my combat log every second or so, and is carrying between fights. I didn't see that before this newest release.   The effect of undefined faded. The effect of undefined faded. The effect of undefined faded."

Not sure if this helps you pinpoint the problem, just wanted to inform you where it showed up for me.  Edit: Also came across a weapon called Concrete Pillowcase, with the flavortext 'GO TO SLEEP DAMN YOU!' Made me laugh."

incremental_games,3cba2l,DFO_Ugin,2,Tue Jul 7 08:51:46 2015 UTC,"Perhaps wound poison should be buffed, currently Doom outclasses it in every way by applying it's damage faster, having its higher tier effect deal more damage than wound poison (500% vs 450%) as well a having a chance of insta-kill."

incremental_games,3cba2l,grantisimo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:49:10 2015 UTC,IMO you should double/triple the cost to pick a specific item ability to make the random option more appealing. Maybe even throw in a rare chance for a special tier-3 version of effects.
incremental_games,3cba2l,Ky1eT,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:30:59 2015 UTC,"Think I could do both of those - Raise the cost of specific debuffs to 8/16 scrap, then add a low chance (1% should do the trick) to get a higher tier debuff from random buys (so a tier 2 debuff if you buy tier 1, or a tier 3 debuff if you buy tier 2)  On top of that, a new power (subpower of Luck of the Draw) could be added to increase this chance by 1% per rank with 4 ranks total.  Confusion wouldn't benefit from this, since it's a binary effect (which is why you can't already buy a superior version)"
incremental_games,3cba2l,coldead,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:56:05 2015 UTC,"Would also allow you to keep different abilities stronger than others by simply making them rarer in the randomizer.

incremental_games,3c8s2c,Mr_Wallet,2,Mon Jul 6 05:25:04 2015 UTC,"We are working on a better tutorial, but in the meantime, staff basically effects property income.  If you don't have all the required staff, the property sliders for maintenance and management will slowly go down, to a minimum of basically the percentage of required employees - ~5% (so, if you have 50% of required employees the slider will bottom out at ~45%).  This reduce the income the property makes by that much.  If you hire up to full, the sliders will slowly go back up.  From a strategy perspective, you'd always want to keep all required employees, and early on this is easy to do, but employees costs go up exponentially (similar to the way property costs do) so later in the game, employee cost will become a much bigger factor, and will potentially out cost their benefit, making it worthwhile for instance to keep some of the properties at only 80% full for instance (particularly with the higher end properties that take a ton of employees to keep full)."

incremental_games,3c8s2c,Nomnomvore,-1,Mon Jul 6 02:05:26 2015 UTC,The waiting isn't good when you notice that the game pauses the moment you go to another tab- even having it on a separate window and clicking onto an entire different program freezes all progress even if you can see the window.
incremental_games,3c8s2c,everyplanetwereach,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:35:21 2015 UTC,This. This exactly. Nobody minds waiting when there's something else to do. But the lag between windows makes the whole game feel slow.

incremental_games,3c8uq1,Mitschu,4,Mon Jul 6 00:00:09 2015 UTC,"Hrm, there seem to be two genres that are very niche, yet super appropriate for incrementals, that never get tapped into.  First - Dating Sims. Bear with me, the whole point of a Dating Sim is to grind your stats up to a respectable number before a time limit (oh, and simulate dating with generic question and answer sessions that make romance feel more like a pop quiz.) Make the grinding portion more tied into generators (an example path, Walkman -> CD Player -> Boombox -> MP3 Player etc. that give you passive boosts to STR growth because ""Good music gets your heart pumping... that's kinda like exercising, right?"") and adjust the time management aspect to be tied in to a prestige system (congratulations, you've successfully convinced Anna to talk to you! You need 500 more INT before she'll give you personal information, but have gained a bonus +10 starting INT and +20% gain to all stat growth for this achievement! Click the ""Wake Up And Realize You Had A Very Detailed Dream"" button to activate this bonus!) and you've got a genre that can handle most of the core concepts of incrementals.  Secondly... Life Management Sims. I'm talking Princess Maker, My Pet Protector, and I can't really think of any other examples because of how niche this genre is. A quick introduction for those unfamiliar, it's like Tamagochis meet the Sims except with far more complicated interactions than just cleaning up poop and throwing balls around to distract, where instead of player as a character, you play as that character's mentor, organizing their life and setting their goals, then helping them reach them. Life Sims tend to be very keen on micromanagement, to the effect of ""Tell me exactly what I should do today."", but with a bit of tweaking it could be turned into an incremental game (i.e., instead of ""Today, I want you to wake up, take part in the local beauty pageant, kill some monsters in the woods, and then take a well deserved sleep. Tomorrow I'll tell you what to do, and then the next day, and then the next, and then..."" you could just set ""First block: pay money to train your swordsmanship. Second block: go stab shit to earn that money back. Third block: sleep so you recover energy. Repeat until I cancel and give new orders."")"
incremental_games,3c8uq1,qznc,2,Tue Jul 7 08:33:56 2015 UTC,"My current project makes the player switch character (Well, it is possible to avoid it, but I want that to be really hard). Now I am thinking about ways to make the characters more likeable. So it feels more like a loss, if one dies. Do you think this is an interesting idea or actually demotivating? An incremental about the topic of sacrifice is unusual, imho."
incremental_games,3c8uq1,PSISP,2,Mon Jul 6 13:01:51 2015 UTC,"I played your project for a little bit. I allowed three characters to write, and out of curiosity, I made one read until he went insane. Sleeping didn't appear to be beneficial; in fact, one guy had nightmares that made the game text worse. Gaining common knowledge didn't appear to do anything, so I stopped after my fourth character.  Based on the theme of the game, I don't think it would be a good idea to make the characters likable in hopes of making the player feel loss from one going insane. They ARE intentionally reading about mind-breaking horrors, so how would that be sympathetic? However, I am curious about how you would handle this."
incremental_games,3c8uq1,qznc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:04:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time. I understand that the end goal of the game did not become clear to you. That is my fault. Essentially mankind needs to learn everything about the horrors so they can fight them. Learning is dangerous and people often die in the process. They sacrifice themselves for mankind, which is honorable."
incremental_games,3c8uq1,PSISP,2,Mon Jul 6 17:00:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late response.  I do think that the idea is great, don't get me wrong. I really like how the text gets corrupted as a character gets more and more knowledge, you did a good job with that. But if you're looking to make a story out of this, the game should play out a lot more slowly. Hell, it may not be an incremental at all. Incrementals have a tendency to make players callous towards in-game characters, as gameplay is quick and characters are treated more as profit machines than, you know, characters. There's certainly incrementals with a story, such as A Dark Room and Candy Box 2, but you still don't feel an emotional connection to the characters (besides, they're more on the border of incremental games).  Is there a reason why you want to make the focus on being incremental? If so, what would be incremental?"
incremental_games,3c8uq1,qznc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:17:06 2015 UTC,"Yes the game evolves away from being an incremental. It certainly started as one. press button, knowledge goes up. It lacks upgrades and I do not feel a need to add them at moment. We will see."

incremental_games,3c8uq1,scrollbreak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:04:20 2015 UTC,"I'm making a game that is a prototype for a latter game with a potential cash prize. Part of it is that as you gain interest points in the game (points which keep accumulating over time), for every ten of those you get you get 1 passive entry into a small prize game. Roughly every 15 games you'll win the game points prize (which is 100,000 Ore...a million ore is 1 gold. Each gold gives you a chance in a lotto game where you can instantly getting to top level and ore gathering capacity). It's only semi passive as once you've run out of auto entries, you have to click on it again to turn it back on (but the more auto entries you have, the longer it is between such clicks)  There's also bashing monsters for instant currency gain, but that's the active part.  Unlike other idle games that invent money out of thin air and can throw money at you, I'm kind of restricted in this project. I'm wondering if it still attracts just as a game (ignoring the idea of real money prize stuff for now)"

I know it's just a prototype but don't let that be a crutch. Doesn't SEEM to bring any new mechanics so just keep that in mind.   Suggestions:  Upgrades:   1- The rate of increase on the upgrades is way too high and fast. x3 each time will cause you to have ridiculously high amounts.   2- Hide the second and third phase upgrades. It forces the player to buy the first phase and then second and then third ect.. Nobody is going to need to skip the first upgrade so hide the others until the first is purchased then have it show up as the next upgrade.   Log:    1- Speed up how fast the text shows up. I like the feature, but it seems a bit slow for me. Like I was waiting for the next word. I believe it's at .15s, try .5 or if that's too fast, try .10.  2- Resources is spelled wrong in line 65-67 of your code.   I'm a sucker for deity type games so I hope this turns out good. :) I'll be waiting for updates and provide more feedback then.  TL;DR Good idea, needs some tweaks."

The word  ""this"" is missing the ""T"" in the second section of the log B. I bought all the upgrades almost instantly by just button mashing for 30 seconds ish (not sure if that's intended or not) C. Possibly implement a buy 10 times or even a hundred times button for the cells and water, that will help speed it up.  For the future try and focus more on the building your earth and planets side than the buildings part of the game, I personally find that if that part tedious if too overdone and there are a myriad of games that just focus on the numbers-goey-uppy part, but the most popular ones tend to have them as side features to a main mechanic.  Also, it would be really cool if you could have a drawing or picture of your world (or solar system if you go there) and watch it slowly build up with the new features.

Suggestions:    After some point you will be generating resources so fast that buying buildings, cells etc. one by one will be pointless - some way of buying several of them at the same time (x10, x100 etc.) would be appreciated. As someone mentioned before - you need to speed up a bit how fast the text shows up. The numbers don't seem to be right. I mean... The start should be fast of course - upgrade which gives x3 per click and costs 10 is not bad - but players need to slow down after some point.    Last but not least...

incremental_games,3c3das,mnp,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:53:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a Web version is easy to make, it's just a matter of pulling out the stuff that doesn't make sense for Web (the mobile ads,  play leaderboard, etc).   And right now getting the iOS version out, as well as wrapping up any lag/optimization issues takes priority over web.  But I imagine Web will be available in a week or so."
incremental_games,3c3das,JoshYouArent,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:30:02 2015 UTC,I think a web version of the game published on Kongregate without theses lags can work very well. I really think that you can have more players on the web version than on Android or iOS.  But this is just my point of view.  Good luck man!
incremental_games,3c3das,efethu,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:36:16 2015 UTC,"Lagging for me also on a stock nexus 5.  Button presses either don't register or do so after a delay.  From a human factors standpoint, every action should always, instantly, provide feedback.  If something isn't allowed, it should be grayed out or make an error beep or something. If it's intentionally ignoring invalid inputs, that's bad."
incremental_games,3c3das,uknowwhoibe,2,Sat Jul 4 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"Buy buttons do grey out when unavailable, and register within 1 frame on all devices I've tested with.  Is it hire buttons for employees where you see the issue?  Side menus?  Are the animations playing when you buy?  Is it every click, or only occasionally.    Sorry to ask so much, but I've now tested on a moto x, nexus 7, note 3, note 4, note 10.1, s5, s6, and had friends test on a few other devices, and I haven't seen significant  lag.  So either it's a specific action that I'm not noticing, some kind of user expectation I'm missing, or an environment issue I can't seem to duplicate."
incremental_games,3c3das,Ky1eT,2,Sat Jul 4 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing the lag at the moment; after sleeping the app for a while it went away.  Perhaps it's only first install?  It was happening on all inputs, including the buy buttons.  I'm not up to employees yet.  One thing I'm still seeing, which looks intentional is the page-flip animation.  If you're on Portfolio, and press portfolio, nothing happens.  There's no highlighting or anything showing you're on that page, so users will be confused here.  Then if you press another tab like Research on down, there's a noticeable delay, maybe 0.25s?, before the animation begins accelerating.    I suggest (1) reducing that animation delay almost to zero, (2) adding a keypress tone for those tab buttons, and (3) highlight the current tab somehow."
incremental_games,3c3das,Ky1eT,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:14:57 2015 UTC,"If you're on Portfolio, and press portfolio, nothing happens.   Thats true... I should probably put in a beep or something when you do this...   Research on down, there's a noticeable delay, maybe 0.25s?, before the animation begins accelerating.   research is the one tab that does have a very slight actual delay.  I have to unbuild and rebuild all the objects on that page when you leave that tab, because the objects are fairly heavy on Unity's UI system.  the delay on most systems is less than 0.2 seconds, but it is still a little noticeable.   I suggest (1) reducing that animation delay almost to zero, (2) adding a keypress tone for those tab buttons, and (3) highlight the current tab somehow.   These are all good, valid suggestions, which I will definitely try to work into the next build."
incremental_games,3c3das,Grzegorxz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:12:13 2015 UTC,It seems to me that it isn't lag as much as the game registering you scrolling instead of tapping.
incremental_games,3c3das,TotomInc,2,Sun Jul 5 02:17:33 2015 UTC,"I wonder how many people never made it past the first month.    Staring at the phone screen for 2 minutes doing nothing is a bit too much for most players. There might be a way to speed it up, but quite a lot of players will just close the game before figuring out how to do that."
incremental_games,3c3das,FyreWhirl,0,Sat Jul 4 12:46:43 2015 UTC,"Its an idle time game.. they are slow in the beginning....  the Short Sale bonus will cut the time in half, and as you continue to play, lots of other research will reduce the time.  I also imagine most players spend at least a little of that first 2 minutes looking at other screens and checking out the research / awards / stats, etc.  Once the first few months go by, and you have a few properties and some money coming in, things feel much faster.  If you play pretty casually for maybe 24 hours, you should be at a point where months go by every 30 seconds, and you'll start to find that 30 seconds goes quickly when buying a bunch of properties and doing other game actions each month."

I also made the game fully open source and made a github account (which I'm still learning how to use).  I have to break saves when I upload the new version, so I'm waiting until I have it as stable as possible so I only have to break saves once. My goal for myself (though things can always change) is to have the update mostly ready by the feedback friday this week, post it there for some feedback on the new balance changes and content additions, and if all looks good I'll do 1.0 next weekend."

Also, I'm planning on switching servers from google drive to github, and I really don't think there's any way to grab localstorage from a different website.

I don't mind that autobuy costs more than buying buildings manually because that can be reduced, but I'd like to be able to allocate more income towards it so that eventually, you won't have to worry about Hamlets at all (or anything higher, if you play long enough).  I'm a very lazy person, and I get a joy out of seeing things getting done automatically. :P"

The venison you got is used for research so that it becomes easier to complete Hamlets. All locations provide research points which can be used to complete that location type more easily."

Miscellaneous Changes   A number of new generic item names and prefixes have been added. Some existing unique items have been changed. Some new unique items have been added.  Bug Fixes   'Five-Finger Discount' will no longer activate when the player's attack is nullified by paralysis. The second strike from the Double Attack debuff will no longer occur if the player's attack is nullified by paralysis. Debuffs will no longer be applied if the combatant's attack is nullified by paralysis. A previous change that lowered the damage dealt by the attack that breaks the player's weapon has been reverted.

Player damage taken as a result of the Confusion debuff is now affected by all boosts and reductions to damage dealt, except those conferred by equipped armour. Combatants suffering from the Confusion debuff can now inflict themselves with the debuff on their own weapons.

No offense to the dev but most incremental games I seen on Steam have been free so far. Even if the price is extremely cheap the question of buying comes down to if the buyer think the extra features are worth ~$3 as the base game itself is literally free elsewhere.  Edit: For the record I don't mind if flash games get added to Steam. Hell I got Epic Battle Fantasy 4 on Steam personally. The thing is though I truthfully honestly love the dev for the years of free high quality games that he made and felt the extra stuff was enough of an excuse to actually throw money at it.

Conservative estimates put her at 55+ hours a week of enthusiastic, superlative work. Hell, she volunteered to continue doing so for free after being terminated, which just further shows how excellent and dedicated she was.) site admins.  They goofed even more by doing so without bothering to warn anyone who would be impacted by this decision, leaving several mods already dealing with fairly important personalities to the best of their abilities suddenly in the high-and-dry without as much as tossing them a slotted spoon to row up shit creek with. Those mods, understandably, went dark (private) because there was no way in hell they could handle their already scheduled content without Victoria, much less maintain new content, and they needed an emergency time-out to figure out what they were going to do.  They then goofed even further by one admin (and co-founder) making popcorn jokes about the drama this was causing and dismissing valid complaints in their official capacity as an admin, showing total disdain, disregard, and dislike for the most important members of Reddit - the volunteers that put in long hours to keep it running.  They goofed on top of that by staying involved in the conflict without actually being forthcoming about the conflict, restricting their interactions with the concerned community to platitudes and vacuous promises. Which, it is worth mentioning, had been made several times already throughout the years without any actual effort to keep their word, going in the opposite direction at times to waste effort and resources on unrequested and non-vital commercialization projects (such as Snoos) over those promised rudimentary features needed for the mods to do their jobs efficiently.  They then further goofed... you can kinda see where I'm going with this. All of which currently has culminated in emotional blackmail appeals to the community to please... think of the community. Why should the community be ""punished"" by the community's willingly taking of a stand, is the ignorant reasoning... which was the right move PR-wise to strum the old worn out chords, but... is sort of as idiotic as telling union members to please quit being members of a union because they're not thinking about how their union actions are affecting union members. (Especially as they had just fired the person responsible for delivering those kinds of messages in a way that the community would accept.)  The TL;DR - an excess, a veritable shitton, of dun goofeds.  Unfortunately, some of the subs have already started going public again in response to those oft-repeated empty promises (most of the older and more prominent ones, having heard this song and dance multiple times before, are still dark however), proving definitively that it is in fact possible to cave faster than a speed hacker on a private Minecraft server."

It's not just about Victoria, or patronizing posts from admins, or lack of mod tools -- it's also about the fundamental disrespect expressed through those actions and many others. Reddit admins can try to fix those problems...but they've established a culture of disrespect for mods and users. Not everyone has witnessed that disrespect, and that's even more true in small niche subs like this.  For those who have witnessed it, it will be very hard for Reddit staff to earn back their trust.

And if the higher end content is difficult to reach without having to prestige a few times, it can buy you more time to develop the content in future versions. It's not purely necessary, but a good prestige system can make or break a game. In a lot of cases the whole restart with MORE could just be that you slowly earn some other currency that can buy things you can't get with your easy currency.

The first level is the game itself and the second is the prestige.  At the start, you are just playing the first level: getting more widgets, getting further into the game.  Once you hit a slow-down, you prestige and restart.  Now you are playing the level 2 game: get more prestige.  I honestly do not really enjoy prestige because it is not a fun game in itself, in general.  Some games do it well - those that, upon prestige, give you choices in what to obtain instead of simply ""2% more income per prestige point"".  Something like ""Choose - 50% income, 25% critical hit, 12% building cost reduction"" seems more like gameplay to me.  Which is, of course, why my game (Matter of Scale) hides prestige-ing and turns it into global research where you can choose what you get.  But games without an end AND without prestige are difficult because they will slow down more and more.  People love the early game clickfest of buying buildings until it slows down.  Then, eventually, you prestige and restart.    If, instead, you did not have prestige and it slowed down further and further, you would eventually quit because there is no game when each decision is a week apart."

I am an average idiot. I clicked your link expecting the game to help me figure out what I needed to do and it didn't really do that.  In clickers there would be something.. HEY DUMBASS CLICK HERE!  In Civ games it would be like okay dumbass 1 click gets you 3 of this and it cost x to do y.  You are delivering a game, stick to a minimum viable project approach.  Trust me on this.  Stick to one race for now. Cut out all plans to do the other two.  OR bring them in as evolutions or something.. Basically additional content.  So, going back to the make it easier for my dumbass to know what is going on, what is going on?  I've glanced over your post and didn't want to head immediately back to it.  Why? WHY WOULD I DO SOMETHING SO INFURIATING? Because I'm thinking about your average user. You made this game, you belong to the broken mouse convention.  You know we don't want to read unless forced.  We want the game to throw it in our face and make us click through it or idle through it.  I would start the player with the basic of the basic.  Make the player unlock things to add a sense of progression, ownership, and investment.  I hope this helps you out.  I don't criticize because I dislike.  I do so because this is an awesome start and I think you can accomplish a lot!  PS. the WIX ads are a little annoying. I have ublock and this is what I see: http://i.imgur.com/QOtcD4c.png"

I'll find a better one for the fuller demo.    And yeah I definitely hear you on the reading, this will be the challenge of making a streamlined tutorial with sequential tooltips with minimal information.  It's possible I'll do progressive unlocks for some basic elements if the tutorials aren't enough.  I'll also add 'tactile feedback' on more buttons, such as an animation or sound when clicked.  As for the other two races, they play mostly identical to this one, and the art is largely done for them. Different strengths and weaknesses, different ability unlock order, but mostly it's like a different skin.  The largest reason for multiple races is a legacy system, you restart your civ after 'winning' and play through as a different alien with bonuses."

incremental_games,3bofd1,Mitschu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:26:44 2015 UTC,Nice - but adding more features to try and make it better goes against the concept of making a shitty incremental.

Only place I've posted a link is in Feedback Friday threads! I made a few balance tweaks and bug fixes and tossed it on Kongregate yesterday (I didn't want people here to get sick of Trimps before it was done so I'm trying not to flood /r/incremental_games). I was hoping for like 20 plays on Kongregate just to make sure I didn't screw anything up, and the game totally blew up.  I'm gonna put 100% of my free time into this game until it's done though, and then I will make a post here (It will be a direct ad-free link too, I won't make you guys use Kongregate!)."

incremental_games,3bnrkn,Ravenlarkx,8,Tue Jun 30 18:21:23 2015 UTC,"You're asking two questions. 'How do I store big numbers?' and 'How do I format them to look good?'  The standard double will store really large numbers (~10308). Use that unless you really need bigger numbers or the loss of precision will make a difference to you.  For making them look good do the arithmetic first then build a custom formatter depending on how you want the M/B/T's etc. to be added. For instance:  string scientific = yourNumber.ToString(""0.00E+0"");   will give scientific notation with 2dp. To make this easier to use throughout your code turn it into an Extension method i.e.  public static string SciFormat(this double num){     return num.ToString(""0.00E+0""); }   (It's common to have an Extensions.cs class as a part of your project where you can add a few helpful methods like this). Then you can call this anywhere you're using a double:  string scientific = myNumber.SciFormat();   edit : and see this discussion for more on big numbers - https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/39mpbj/how_to_calculate_hugeexponential_numbers/"
incremental_games,3bnrkn,ScaryBee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:36:56 2015 UTC,"Could make an option to switch the view between scientific and custom number format. I personally like the custom number formatting as long as I can sort of tell what's coming next. One game used months, Januillion febrillion marchillion... It was a change up but I could still kind of guess what's coming next so I know how far I was from next purchase."
incremental_games,3bnrkn,Ky1eT,2,Wed Jul 1 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"Keep numbers in scientific format, this way you won't hit any limits(unless you go for really big numbers).  Write your own function to display numbers in human readable format. Or google it. And add the option to change the display format to scientific notation for people who prefer it."
incremental_games,3bnrkn,efethu,2,Tue Jun 30 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"I got the place++ coding from google, then I just made a function with a number input that returns a string with the rounded number and label.  There's some numbers I want to display more than one decimal, so I might add another function parameter for the rounding.  public function roundNumber(num1:Number):String   {   place = 0;       while(num1 >= 1000)      {      num1 = num1 / 1000;      place++;      }    num1 = Math.floor(num1 * 10) / 10;       if(place == 0)      {      tempString = num1.toString();      }      else if(place == 1)      {      tempString = num1.toString() + ""k"";      }      else if(place == 2)      {      tempString = num1.toString() + ""m"";      }      else if(place == 3)      {      tempString = num1.toString() + ""b"";      }      else if(place == 4)      {      tempString = num1.toString() + ""t"";      }      else if(place == 5)      {      tempString = num1.toString() + ""q"";      }   return tempString;   }"

incremental_games,3bnrkn,J0eCool,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's definitely better, I'm new to coding (3 years or so self-taught) so I often do things more complex and lengthy than necessary, unless I think it will slow the program down then I make a pretty good effort.  I'll switch it to that, it's possible I'll add more suffixes."
incremental_games,3bnrkn,Levgre,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:19:57 2015 UTC,"Whatever works!  In general, I prefer writing code that's readable to writing code that's fast, because more often than not it won't be the thing slowing the whole application down. In this case, I find the array easier to read. It might not be for you! Which means my more clever solution would be worse :p"
incremental_games,3bnrkn,J0eCool,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:37:06 2015 UTC,"I think using an array is probably worth it anyway, since the alternative is having to type out another if whenever you want to add a new suffix, haha."
incremental_games,3bnrkn,tangentialThinker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:33:49 2015 UTC,"You don't store formatted numbers in the game, you display them.  You say you want to do something like 1M - 400K = 600K. Internally, it would be 1000000 - 400000 = 600000, and you would display the end result as ""600K"" but store it as 600000."
incremental_games,3bnrkn,PSISP,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:20:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely have a custom wrapper function for all formatting in case you want to have a settings option for player to use scientific notation or not, if you want to use M/K/T etc. you want to use scientific notation anyway and just swap the 'e+x' into proper suffix for displaying purpose."

What I ended up going with was a custom class that held 20+ floats and functions to shift the numbers around when necessary. Each variable in the class represented a different place value,  a variable for ones, a variable for thousands, a variable millions, and so on and so on.  That was for extremely large number past Septillion. For readability I have a couple of functions that return the first 3-6 digits and a different one to check what place that is (million/billion)."
