As someone who is a scientist who studies cats, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls sabertooths cats.  If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either.  They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""cat family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Carnivora, which includes things from bobcats to lions to tigers.    So your reasoning for calling a sabertooth a cat is because random people ""call the black ones cats?""  Let's get lions and tigers in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape?  It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works.  They're both.  A sabertooth is a sabertooth and a member of the cat family.  But that's not what you said.  You said a sabertooth is a cat, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the cat family cats, which means you'd call lions, tigers, and other cats cats, too.

Dog wasn't in pain, but was so fatigued she couldn't care for herself. My family took the dog home and arranged for neighbor who is a vet come to over to our house to put the dog down.  I had a date scheduled with a girl I met on the Internet. She was traveling from a couple of towns over. It was an overnight trip, so it wasn't like she could just go home. She was staying with a local friend.  I told her we had to cancel the date. She was locked out of her friends apartment so she didn't have anywhere to go. I offered to let her watch the dog be put down, she said yes.   It was a dramatic scene. Everyone was crying and talking about how much they missed the dog. Everyone except me. After the dog died we left.  She asked why I wasn't crying. I said ""I've always hated that damn dog."" She broke out laughing. The rest is history."

This reduces the tensile strength of the keratin so greatly that the hair can be wiped away. Nair's slogans include: ""The Less That You Wear, the More You Need Nair!""; ""Like Never Before""; and ""We wear short shorts, Nair for short shorts"".

So I packed up my accordion and had to move to a city in Ohio where I lived in a tree, and I worked in a nasal decongestant factory. I played on the company bowling team, and every single night I had a strange recurring dream where I was wearing lederhosen in a vat of sour cream. But that's really not important to the story.  The very next year I met a dental hygienist with a spatula tattooed on her arm, but I didn't keep in touch and I lost her number. Then I got myself a job on a tator tot farm, and I spent my life-savings on a split-level cave twenty miles below the surface of the Earth. And I really make a mighty fine jelly bean and pickle sandwich, for what it's worth.  Then one day I was in the forest trying to get a tan, when I heard the tortured screaming of a funny little man. He was caught in a bear trap and I set him free. The guy that I rescued was grateful as could be, and it turns out he's a big-shot producer on TV.

This is a reminder to work the names or titles into responses in the form of a scene. For starters, you could present movie titles in a movie trailer, ask why someone's reading that book, or work a song title into some lyrics.  Responses that outright state a name or title will be removed. Also, simply adding quotation marks will not automatically make your response fit the scene format.

The admins should [theorerically] be providing ""free speech,"" not the moderators.

People sometimes assume the only reason it said ""wounded"" instead of ""dead"" was because of Nintendo's censorship policies at the time, but the word that was used in the original Japanese was せんとうふのう, which can't be translated as anything like ""dead"", but means roughly ""unable to fight"", so ""wounded"" is actually a more accurate translation in any case."

ScenesFromAHat,39ju4p,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:36:22 2015 UTC,"Go (game):       Go (simplified Chinese: 围棋; traditional Chinese: 圍棋; pinyin: wéiqí, Japanese: 囲碁 igo,  literal meaning: ""encircling game"", Korean: 바둑 baduk ) is a board game involving two players, that originated in ancient China more than 2,500 years ago. It was considered one of the four essential arts of a cultured Chinese scholar in antiquity. Its earliest written reference dates back to the Confucian Analects [citation needed].  There is significant strategy involved in the game, and the number of possible games is vast (10761 compared, for example, to the 10120 possible in chess),  despite its relatively simple rules.  The two players alternately place black and white playing pieces, called ""stones"", on the vacant intersections (""points"") of a board with a 19x19 grid of lines. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards,  and archaeological evidence shows that game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17×17 grid. By the time the game had spread to Korea and Japan in about the 5th and 7th centuries CE respectively, however, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard.   The objective of the game—as the translation of its name implies—is to have surrounded a larger total area of the board with one's stones than the opponent by the end of the game,  although this result typically involves many more intricacies than simply using surrounding areas directly.  Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones may be removed from the board if captured—this is done by surrounding an opposing stone or group of stones by occupying all orthogonally-adjacent points.  The two players place stones alternately until they reach a point at which neither player wishes to make another move; the game has no set ending conditions beyond this. When a game concludes, the territory is counted along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second) to determine the winner.  Games may also be won by resignation.  As of mid-2008, there were well over 40 million Go players worldwide, the overwhelming majority of them living in East Asia.  As of May 2012 [update], the International Go Federation has a total of 74 member countries and four Association Members covering multiple countries.

ScenesFromAHat,392xpb,BennyBXB,24,Mon Jun 8 22:13:18 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, the dialogue can actually imply a scene being acted out, like /u/Battletooth's example.  Other times, yeah, it's not very creative, but that can't always be helped in prompts such as:   Things you can say about X, but not your girlfriend.  Clickbait headlines from the Middle East.  The answer is X. What is the question?   These can't really be acted out beyond a line of dialogue, and this actually happens quite a bit on the real WLiiA, particularly with the ""but not your girlfriend"" prompts. We've continued to allow them because they're still not AskReddit-y answers, as discussed in this thread.  Though I could have AutoModerator (DrewCareyBot) post a reminder on prompts that ask for news headlines. I'll also add it to the ""Please avoid submitting"" section in the sidebar. Edit: Done.

ScenesFromAHat,392xpb,CaptainHair59,7,Tue Jun 9 01:10:56 2015 UTC,"That, and the long posts.  Some things are half a screen long.  And while that stuff may be entertaining, it isn't true to the format.  It's rare for a scene on the show to be longer than 5 seconds.

ScenesFromAHat,392xpb,Matthewthedark,3,Tue Jun 9 02:52:39 2015 UTC,"The difference is in the presentation and what is said. Consider for example the prompt ""Bad times to suddenly become naked"". There are different levels of acting out the scene e.g:   No effort: 'While operating on someone' Minimal effort: ""Alright, time to operate. Is anyone else feeling cold?"" Good effort: ""Nurse, when I said 'time to remove your clothes' I was only talking to the patient.""   The difference is the extra implication the other creates. The second example merely makes someone randomly naked without really making the nakedness anything other than something that happened, while the third implies that not only it's happened, but it's expanded to include an absurd yet humorous justification.   Acting out a scene doesn't necessarily require someone to actively describe what's happening, but it should imply that the scene is part of something larger. This isn't necessary for every prompt, nor for every entry, but if you can make a prompt reply one level removed in your speech, you don't necessarily need the action."

ScenesFromAHat,38u2m9,BenjyWentNative,7,Sun Jun 7 01:18:34 2015 UTC,"This could work.  The greatest crime ever is about to be committed. The only one who can prevent it is the guy who gets bit by a radioactive fruit fly. For unknown reasons, this gives him access to the collective memories of all fruit flies ever to have lived.  Unfortunately, this gift came with another trait: he only has 24 hours to live. Within those 24 hours, Fruit Fly Man must piece together the puzzle from the memories of hundreds of fruit flies, since each of their lives were so short they only got small bites of information.  The point of view lies with both Fruit Fly Man and his side kick, a detective who recently got laid off for not being able to ultimately solve the crime. He needs his job back, so in desperation, he's the only one who's willing to believe Fruit Fly Man.  24 hours pass, and they've hit a blind road. Fruit Fly Man finds one last piece of evidence, but it's not enough. However, the detective can't just give up now. He must do this for Fruit Fly Man!  A seemingly unimportant, but heavily foreshadowed piece of evidence, together with Fruit Fly Mans last memory, is the only thing that he can possibly go off of. The odds are all against him, but he would rather die trying than give up now.  Shortly after this, the criminals show up. They know that the detective has almost found them, but didn't know he didn't have the whole picture. It doesn't matter though, they are stronger, both physically and in numbers, than the detective.  Cornered, the detective drinks the blood of Fruit Fly Man in hopes of getting super powers. It works! The detective can now fly and defeats the criminals.  The victory is bitter sweet, however, as the audience is reminded that this also means the detective now only has 24 hours to live.  In the final scene, we see him bury Fruit Fly Man near a wooden cabin by a lake. After the ceremony, the detective drinks a last glass of wine, smokes a last cigarette, says something so deep it gives us all goosebumps, before he lays down to die beside his friend...  credits"
