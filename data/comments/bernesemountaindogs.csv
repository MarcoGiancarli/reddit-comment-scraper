bernesemountaindogs,3dj6yo,C_M_V,2,Thu Jul 16 19:19:28 2015 UTC,Don't have a compost pile.  We live in SC where the temps have been in the 90's.  They are inside most of the time.  Nothing in the environment has changed.  None of the tests performed by our regular vet or the eergency vet turned up anything abnormal other than a mild UTIin the  Newfie.  Regular vet gave the Saint and teh Berner an anto-nausea injection adn we started them on pantoprazole (Protonix).  We'll see what happens.  Not aware of an canine flu in the area.

The gray cat does not like him, but she grew up with a west highland white terrier who wouldn't leave her alone. I think it's fair to say she has an unfair and biased opinion of dogs. We are hoping that changes and Jax is the perfect dog for us to try.  The Orange one is nervous around him but does approach and go nose to nose with him. It's still mostly an around you, but not close to you relationship.   The best thing is that he is a very passive dog. He isn't hyper and will actually remain calm to give that cats a chance. Unfortunately, he is still clumsy from his rapid growth. So much so that the cats don't know what to think of him running into everything when trying to get close. Lol I have a pretty strong feeling that in a couple months he will be best buds with at least the Orange one."

bernesemountaindogs,3b420v,WhatAFox,3,Thu Jun 25 21:30:11 2015 UTC,Find someone with a retriever or lab.  Our Berners weren't very interested in swimming much on their own until our golden retriever showed them how much fun it could be.  It probably would have been kind of hard to teach them on our own - sometimes you just need another dog to do it for you.

bernesemountaindogs,39gcyu,stick-down,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:35:44 2015 UTC,"I got my boy in SW Michigan from an Amish farmer. Sorry I can't remember the family name, but I remember finding a classified ad placed by the farmer's veterinarian. Many Amish families are swiss and have long used them as farm dogs, which is what the family was using my pup's parents for.   Apparently the Amish have gotten a bad reputation for operating puppy mills. Please be mindful of this if it's the route you choose to take. If the seller isn't willing to let you meet the dog or it's parents first, it's a bad sign. Also you might want to see if you can look at where the dogs live (kennel? Barn? In the house?) and determine if it looks like a safe and healthy environment. If there aren't some sort of lineage documents offered, be wary of that as well."
bernesemountaindogs,39gcyu,Pezasauris,2,Thu Jun 11 18:32:56 2015 UTC,The best sign of a reputable breeder is someone who registers their dogs in bernergarde.org.  You can trace back lineage 10 generations and the better breeders will pay you to have your dog go through OFA tests and post the results.
bernesemountaindogs,39gcyu,scattyboy,2,Fri Jun 12 04:53:31 2015 UTC,"From what I've learned, the Amish are one of the biggest groups responsible for the massive amount of inbreeding for the BMD and GSMD.  I've seen AKC pedigrees where the same male is the sire for four generations in a row.  The Amish are the sole reason that rescue groups like Bernese Auction Rescue Coalition exist.  Now there may be a few Amish breeders that are reputable, but I would advise against it unless you see the pedigree.    If you want a Berner that will have a higher chance of spending as many healthy years as they can with you, check your pedigrees.  Don't buy them from the side of the road, don't buy them from a breeder that will not allow you to visit their home or has no desire to visit yours.  A berner puppy from a good, healthy bloodline will run you at least $1500 to $2000+.    Also /u/scattyboy is on point.  Most breeders that register their litters with bernergarde are good breeders that breed for the benefit of the breed."

They are made of really hard plastic - not metal.  Easily put back together.  I occasionally find them unlinked in the backyard.  Other than that they pretty indestructible."

I had a tick run in a little while back and it was NOT fun.  PSA: Now, I use NexGuard as a flea/tick preventative. It is a once a month pill and seems to be very effective. With all of that thick dark hair, Berners are a prime target for ticks and they can be hard to spot.

bernesemountaindogs,33ds33,Naamakauhu,4,Tue Apr 21 18:30:29 2015 UTC,Get a new vet! My pup had knees issues and a vet told me it was too much to fix- a new vet said she would be fine with physical therapy- she is fully recovered and I will never go back to the old vet!
bernesemountaindogs,33ds33,rebecca0nline,2,Tue Apr 21 20:41:24 2015 UTC,"This one was ortopedic vet, but we are getting a second opinion. My SO is a physiotherapist, so she verified to me the Xray pictures and told me, that she does need the endoscopy to determine severity. Helps to hear that our vet might be just overreacting!"
bernesemountaindogs,33ds33,cyallater,2,Tue Apr 21 21:14:46 2015 UTC,yes! definitely get a second a opinion! Because surgery or being put down as the only options seems to be extremely severe. Our 1 year old berner has some sort of shoulder issue but is managed with occasional pain meds.
bernesemountaindogs,33ds33,cef911f1,2,Wed Apr 22 00:17:40 2015 UTC,"What is wrong with her elbows?  Along with our Berner, we have several large breed dogs.  Our Newfoundland had both her knees operated on when he was close to you Berner's age.  She's been fine since although she does have a touch of arthritis that she takes Rimadyl for. (She's 5 now.)  The surgeries weren't cheap, especially since she tore one out and it had to be redone.  She was operated on at North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine  in Raleigh. (They're ranked 3rd in the nation.)  I don't know where you live or what you can afford but check for a Vet School near you, and good luck."
bernesemountaindogs,33ds33,cef911f1,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:10:57 2015 UTC,"The socket where the elbow attaches is loose, so there is a grind which is breaking the ligaments/joints. We live in finland and just the endoscopy is around 2k euro's and the surgery is +4k. Not that money matter's I'm selling everything I own if I have to.  It's comforting to hear that your newfoundland is feeling well. When ever I see my dogs in pain, it hurts me in a way I cannot even describe. Our berner already started on antibiotics and also takes vitamins and a herbal medicine to help with the pain and increase the ligament/joint fluids."

bernesemountaindogs,331g8u,No1ButtMe,2,Sat Apr 18 16:20:25 2015 UTC,"both my boys were not natural swimmers.   Each one would walk in and get their toes wet, but would not do any more.  Over time we trained them to go out deeper (over their heads) and actually swim.   We did this by either throwing sticks for them, or swimming ourselves.  Now they love the water"
bernesemountaindogs,331g8u,freddo411,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:27:01 2015 UTC,"My boy HATES water. Won't even step in puddles. First time in water was like your guy, he jumped in after another dog while playing, got shocked and instantly ran out and refused to go back in. A few months later we took him to the cottage, tried to coax him into the water from the beach, but he actually yelped when a wave touched his foot. Little sissy won't go near the stuff unless he's drinking it.   On the bright side, no wet dog smell."
bernesemountaindogs,331g8u,Batsignal_on_mars,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"Mine HATES getting wet.  If it is raining, he will brace himself against the door jamb to try to get out of going outside to pee. I have to push him out the door, and then he quickly pees and rushes back in.  Goes around puddles, and forget swimming.  Even bath time is difficult.  Ah well.  He's cute.  Lol"
bernesemountaindogs,331g8u,kiwi1855,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:15:40 2015 UTC,Mine hates it.  Avoids it at all costs.
bernesemountaindogs,331g8u,HeadSpeakerJunky,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:57:09 2015 UTC,This is exactly what happened to my boy.  When he realized he was in water he ran for shore and will never go back.  He hates being wet period.  When his face gets wet he will rub his head on the carpet or grass until he feels he is dry enough.
bernesemountaindogs,331g8u,NotForTheOtherUse,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:32:29 2015 UTC,"Wow.  I'm surprised by the comments in this thread.  Our Berner absolutely LOVES to swim.  We live near the beach.  As long as the water is relatively flat and the waves not too strong, she runs into the water and swims.. And swims...  And swims!  We ended up having to tie a really long rope to her so she wouldn't swim out too far into the shipping channel!"

Doesn't really like the rain much, but he'll go out to potty if he really needs to. My 8 week old boy hasn't had any swimming opportunities yet but doesn't mind rain. My husband plans to take him out with him on his kayak before he gets too big. He'll have a life jacket, of course."

bernesemountaindogs,331g8u,bernerTman,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:14:12 2015 UTC,"My two boys love to swim and it's a great way to exercise them when it's hot out.  We taught the older boy to swim by throwing sticks into the water for him to chase; the younger dog copied him and now it's hard to get him out of the water if he isn't ""ready"" to be done and go home.  When its raining they're pretty impervious to it - they'll lie outside getting wet and be completely unfazed."
bernesemountaindogs,331g8u,zerberts,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:16:47 2015 UTC,Mine didn't like swimming as a puppy because she only used her front paws at first and would sink. But then I started taking her to a dog park by a river the next summer (when she was 1.5) and she would just wade in and watch the labs jumping in and fetching. After watching them for a bit she got the courage to follow them. It helps that on land she's the kind of dog that runs after the dogs who are fetching the ball. She learned how to swim gradually and its one of the best ways to exercise her in the summer because of the heat.  She doesn't like rain but I think that's because she doesn't like getting her head wet. When her face does get wet one of the first things she does is rub her face on the ground or bury her face in a towel (if I have one handy) until her face is dry.

He is also very good with female dogs, smaller animals of all varieties, livestock and poultry (he even tried to adopt a baby chick whose mother rejected it).  He doesn't care for male dogs who are around his size, but he is fine with smaller and larger males.  I think he sees male dogs around his size as competition."

Since he was little I have done little things throughout the day like holding his ears, finger in his nose, light pulling of his hair, grabbing his feet and extra skin. Basically anything a small child would do. I started doing this the day he came home and do it from time to time to keep up the habits. My family has lots of little ones around and Argos does great with them. The one thing he does is sometimes he knocks them over but nothing major. Any dog as long as they have the proper training and socialization can be great around kids. Just start early and any kids that come up to pet him let them this way the dog understands little kids are fun."

Do berners have an undercoat?"
bernesemountaindogs,2z33op,fortunefighting,2,Sun Mar 15 14:21:57 2015 UTC,"I'd actually recommend against a furminator in your case.  Furminators do very well with shorter-haired double-coats like a lab.  Berners do have double coats, but their outer ""guard"" coat is very long so the furminator wouldn't get down the to the undercoat very effectively.    My recommendation is a greyhound comb (all dog owners should have this, #1 tool in your arsenal) and an undercoat rake with curved teeth like this: http://www.amazon.com/Undercoat-Rake-DeSheddingTool-Fantastic-Grooming-High-Brush-Cat-Grooming-Grooming/dp/B00CMJZ4TE  Source: Used to be professional dog groomer, tried a lot of equipment, and asked a lot of questions from fellow groomers at several different locations."

As a general potty rule of thumb, your puppy can hold it for about an hour for every month it is old.  When you take it out, give a consistent command for pee and poop (our guy has ""pee outside"" and ""poop outside.""  we don't mince words, and we also made sure he knew the difference between ""inside,"" ""outside,"" and ""crate."") and remember to praise a lot, and only when they're finished.

bernesemountaindogs,2y8lu1,bwalks007,2,Sat Mar 7 18:33:44 2015 UTC,"Just generic dog training stuff here, so not Bernese specific. Get a crate that gives the pup just enough room to move and sleep comfortably, but not enough to walk around or it will be tempted to make a mess in the cage!   For a couple weeks, you will have to get up every few hours in the night to let them out, and definitely try to let them out about every 3 hours. Lots of praise and a positive attitude!   Try to start training as soon as you can. The earlier you start, the easier it will be. I would also suggest taking them to a puppy training class so they can socialize with other dogs and you as an owner/trainer can learn a little.   Best of luck with your new best bud. =)"

bernesemountaindogs,2w3jwj,flyoddd,3,Mon Feb 16 18:09:17 2015 UTC,"The first dog I ever had was a Berner. My parents got him in 2003, and he died in 2010, so he lived for 7 years. It was definitely really hard when he died, and I still miss him a lot, but he was the greatest. When I left home for college this past fall, my dad gave me one of the sweatshirts that the dog had torn up from playing tug of war all the time. Even if you'll only have a few years to be with him potentially, I think any time is totally worth it. They're extremely sweet, loyal, and beautiful dogs. If you're really worried about how you'll feel when the dog passes, it's completely understandable. Mine kind of had a rough death, and it was the first time I ever saw my dad cry. You kind of just have to figure out if dealing with the loss is worth it."

It makes me so sad when people advise others not to look into this breed because of their short lifespans.  Just because they don't live as long doesn't mean they're less than adequate.  If anything, their short lifespan will make you appreciate the time you have with your dog more."

She was #10 in a litter of 11 - I think it was the dame's second litter? She's smaller at 80lbs, but she has perfect markings and coat. If I had kept her in tact, she'd show pretty dang well.  I have not incurred any costs that are out of the ordinary. She had a sensitive tummy as a pup, but outgrew that. I'd even say she's cheaper to maintain ;-) than most dogs I know (rescue, other pure breds, etc).   I think the biggest factor is the breeder (as you've mentioned). Make sure the dame hasn't had more than 2 litters, and preferably with a sire they bring in from elsewhere to ensure strong genetics and no inbreeding. That's my $0.02."

One of them has had two litters, but one of the litters was only one puppy (apparently artificial insemination didn't work so well!) and it will be the first litter for the other dog.  The breeder actually plans to fly the female(s) to the sire when she decides who she's going to use because there aren't any other quality breeding BMDs anywhere around here."

It was the first time I had ever seen such a display of physical prowess performed by my couch potato, but he did it with ease and astonishing grace.  Of course I have never seen him perform such a feat before or since.  So, known for jumping fences?  No...but they can do it with the right motivation.

She seems to do fine with change, although we haven't moved or anything, but we have taken trips and she travels like a champ (drove from WA state to So. Calif).  She has a little Newfoundland sister and they get along great.  Worst parts?  Just the regular sort of things with big dogs - she counter surfs, which is annoying.  She's going through her teenage years at the moment so barks a bit (and it's LOUD) but I'm being consistent and it's going down.  She, too, can get a bit hyper when she's excited.  She's only 65lbs at the moment, so will probably be a bit small for a Berner when she reaches her full maturity.  Not complaining mind you! :D  She does shed, but not as bad as some breeds.  Not much of a drooler - not next to her sister anyways!  She's pretty laid back for a 9 month old, but does like her walks (she gets a good two a day, plus some runs in the yard).  I've made sure to make sure she's well socialized.  Advice?   I think BMDs are very social dogs, so make sure you have time for them.  They want very much to be part of a family, so include them.  Train them early and consistently.  Socialize a ton (but that goes for any breed!)."
bernesemountaindogs,2uts82,Goldie2000,2,Thu Feb 5 03:59:25 2015 UTC,"We have only ever had a big dog so that part of it we are super use to. Our mastiff has a flea allergy so he sheds like crazy, how frequently do you have to brush her? The lack of drool is a huge plus. Hopper only drools when he is super excited but oh man is it a lot.   We will have access to dog parks in our community so hopefully well be able to socialize her. Hopper is a people dog so I think he will benefit from having a sibling.   Thank you so much for sharing!"
bernesemountaindogs,2uts82,Goldie2000,1 point,Thu Feb 5 04:11:09 2015 UTC,"Brushing is good - we have a BMD with a short curly coat but she runs to having dreadlocks if she's not brushed, so at least once a week.  What I've taken to doing is keeping a brush near my desk and she gets a brush about once a day/every other day.  Often they're brief, but it's enough and she loves the attention!"
bernesemountaindogs,2uts82,C_M_V,2,Thu Feb 5 14:46:36 2015 UTC,"I have an older male BMD and have had him since he was a puppy.  He's a great dog.  No health issues as yet, but he came from very good lines so we spent a fortune on him initially.  He has always been a social butterfly- loves people of all sizes, loves animals of all sizes, is tolerant of livestock and poultry.  He tolerates care and maintenance very well, which is good since he needs a thorough brushing about once a week to prevent dreadlocks.  He is a shedder, but not as much as you would guess with a coat so full and thick.  The hair tends to bind up with itself and form dreads rather than falling out all over your belongings.  My guy is a couch potato and always has been.  Walks are great, but he doesn't expect them or need them every day.  He doesn't like walks during the hot times of the year, but loves them in the cold weather.  He prefers to just be close to his people.  Like really close, as in he will sit on your feet and lean against you all day if given a chance.  BMDs are easy to train because they are people oriented and very motivated by food.  A little too motivated by food, in fact.  They can run on the heavy side if you aren't careful about diet and exercise.  Coping with change can be an issue with my BMD, but he is an old fart and wasn't always so stuck in his ways.  He likes his schedule and doesn't like deviations from it. He is very vocal about his distaste for things not being done the way he likes them.  He will ""talk"" about the injustices we present him with.  BMDs have a variety of vocalizations that are hilarious.  My advice is to get a BMD.  They are fabulous animals.  BUT- choose a reputable breeder and get a dog from good lines.  The breed has a lot of health issues.  I would also advise getting pet insurance because even the cleanest lines can have some expensive health problems crop up sometimes.  Good luck!"
bernesemountaindogs,2uts82,Goldie2000,2,Thu Feb 5 14:29:52 2015 UTC,I completely second the good breeder!  We paid extra for ours too and I think it's so worth it!

This breed is attaches themselves to their pack very strongly, and it is hard for them to get over being separated from their pack. This makes adopting a Berner a very difficult process.

So our Berner always had someone to play with if we couldn't give him attention. Unfortunately, we had to put our Great Pyrenees down last year, and our Berner took it pretty hard. He can't stand being alone now. My parents are lucky enough to own their own business, so they can take him to work every day. But if nobody is paying attention to him at home he cries and whines until somebody does. I've heard these dogs don't like being by themselves."
bernesemountaindogs,2tzd8s,kadno,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:39:32 2015 UTC,"Awwww I'm so sorry. I love Great Pyrenees and would love to get one of them next. (Even more hair than the Bernese, though, no?)   As far as the attention goes, it's not even like I'm leaving her alone—she pretty much has free reign of the downstairs and can follow me wherever she wants, but if I'm not giving her my undivided attention she'll keep whining and barking at me. =\ Hoping if I keep ignoring it she'll learn that it's not going to get her what she wants! I just don't want her to end up with for-real separation anxiety."
bernesemountaindogs,2tzd8s,Fakbo,1 point,Thu Jan 29 00:20:02 2015 UTC,"My puppy did the same, but if you stay consistent with your training she will begin to understand that whining and barking will not get her out."
bernesemountaindogs,2tzd8s,Fakbo,2,Wed Jan 28 22:06:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's what I'm hoping. It's not even like I'm putting her in the crate (unless I'm leaving the house); I'm just, you know, not giving her my full attention every hour of every day! I'll sit on the couch to read a book and she'll bark at me, so I ignore her until she stops (which she's getting better at, but sometimes I just get so frustrated that I pick her up and dump her outside if she keeps doing it). She rings a bell to go outside to go to the bathroom, but she's now started using that to get attention, which is annoying—but I make her go outside anyway and usually leave her there for a few minutes even when she turns around and immediately scratches to come back inside (which is usually). I think she's starting to learn not to ring the bell unless she really wants to go out, but it's going to be a long road, I think.  How long do you think it took for your berner to realize that whining/barking won't get her the attention she wants? I try to make a point of giving my puppy attention when she's being quiet, but that always runs the risk of, you know, riling her up again. =P"
bernesemountaindogs,2tzd8s,TheArcticBear,1 point,Thu Jan 29 00:16:56 2015 UTC,"At 3 months she is still figuring and testing things out, she's a toddler. Berners take a little bit more time to train than other dogs as well due to their stubbornness. There is a lot of stimulation at this age and this will make connections take a while to form.   My Puppy is almost 6 months. She is still trying out new things. Just today she tried to get her paws up on the counter. Her barking at us is a lot more subdued. She only barks when we are eating. I'm no Caeser Milan but there are a couple of tactics that we are using to train our Berner, which have worked on my past dogs.   If she barks at you, turn your back, do not say anything, do not look at her, do not give her any sense of attention, do not pick her up.  Carry around treats, or have them nearby where you like to relax. When she is laying around doing nothing (which may be rare at the moment) walk up and say, ""Quiet."" and make an action like your finger to your lip. Then after a few seconds give her a treat and say, ""Good Quiet :D"" (My Berner still hasn't really learned this but she is getting better)   I've heard and read that six months is when dogs start to learn best. Most real obedience training classes don't allow dogs in until they are 6 months (anything younger is mainly a means to socialize your dog.) Ellie knows how to sit, come, thank you, off. She still has a hard time with down, and quiet, and she is no where near trained lol, but patience and consistency is key.  If a bell is what she rings to go out, ALWAYS put your dog out when she rings the bell, even if she scratches to come back in. She will eventually learn that she should only ring the bell if she wants to go out.  When we first got Ellie we had her in a pen in the kitchen at night because we didn't want her to make a mess in our bedroom. We had to sleep train her just like a baby. First I slept downstairs on the floor with her so she would get comfortable. Anytime she whined or howled. I let her outside and then when she came back in i placed her back in her pen. Then once she was comfortable after few days. I would go upstairs to bed while she remained downstairs. (now some people say that since dogs are pack animals they need to sleep with their pack but we had to wait until she knew to either hold it through the night or to make some noise to go outside) We would then wait 10 minutes. IF the whining didn't stop then wed go downstairs let her outside, bring her back in, and put her back in the pen, then go upstairs. Then we would extend the time longer and longer until she whined herself tired. (just like a baby) She now sleeps in our room and she still gets up in the middle of the night but only to go outside. Just being consistent taught her how to behave at night.  TLDR: You will probably have to wait fr your puppy to mature a little more. She's only been on the earth for 3 months. She's a toddler. You are doing the right things, just keep at it, remain consistent with the behaviour you expect and be patient."
bernesemountaindogs,2tzd8s,PotatoC570,3,Thu Jan 29 02:12:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great reply! She sleep-trained shockingly quickly—she usually goes out for the last time around 10 or 10:30 and can hold it until 6am or so when my husband goes downstairs for breakfast and takes her out (she sleeps in our bedroom, but confined in a playpen, which has basically become her crate).   The ""Quiet"" thing is a great idea. I'm definitely going to start trying that. We already keep treats around (thank you Puppies For Dummies! =P) so it shouldn't be too hard to implement. I do try to give her attention when she's being quiet, which of course always runs the risk of just getting her riled up...  I'm just concerned that being here with her all the time now will make her that much more anxious to be alone once I get a job again. =\ Glad to know she probably isn't a basket case quite yet, though. :) (And we will definitely be starting puppy classes as soon as she has all her shots!)"

bernesemountaindogs,2sfdoo,PravdaZGB,3,Wed Jan 14 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"I have a Berner and have lived in Chicago, New York, and Iowa - always in apartments, but did spend a few months in a house.  When in the house, he never really seemed to make use of the extra space. He's been fine - he gets a lot of outside time and is a big couch potato anyway.  I think as long as he gets enough exercise outside of the apartment, and it sounds like he would, it's fine.   Talk to your vet, but the biggest thing I would worry about is boredom as long as you make the commitment to getting him exercise (but boredom can happen in a house too)."
bernesemountaindogs,2sfdoo,im_not_bovvered,2,Wed Jan 14 19:29:30 2015 UTC,"We raised our Berner from a puppy in two different apartments. The smallest was 700sqft. He did great in both apartments.Now that we have moved into a 3,000sqft home with 5 acres of land he acts just about the same.   Like im_not_bovvered said keeping your berner occupied is key. Ours got into as much trouble as he could when he wasn't distracted or caged. The key is making sure you wear your puppy out. They have a lot of energy and that large reduction in energy that is supposed to occur in male berners around age 2 still hasn't come for ours (3.5 years old and acts like he's a 10lb dog). He doesn't know his size which is evident when we play with him.  Note that during the first 2 years we had him I lived close enough from work to come home at lunch and let him out. This helped a lot.   Sounds like you have everything already figured out and will be fine with your new pup. Enjoy! They are amazing dogs and grow up so fast."
bernesemountaindogs,2sfdoo,Rockfootball47,1 point,Wed Jan 14 23:13:29 2015 UTC,"There are also toys that can help get berners mentally and physically active inside the home. My pup has an IQ ball (found on amazon) that I fill with her food. She runs around for a good half hour each time to get it all out. In the winter this is a godsend- I really can't be out there for hours and hours in the cold.   In case you haven't going through puppyhood before: One thing I have to warn you about (for any breed of dog) is something I didn't see coming before getting a puppy either- that puppyhood lasts a LONG time. It wasn't until about about 5-7 months old that my pup started sleeping through the night and holding her bladder. At 16weeks, when you want to work full time, you can't really expect a puppy to hold their bladder for more than 3 hours.

bernesemountaindogs,2sfdoo,Kaju_Inu,1 point,Fri Jan 16 00:27:04 2015 UTC,"If you train your pup to bark or sit by the patio door to be let out, that can be a good way to intro them to a house.  Get a big fake grass/pee training area and put it out there for a little bit.  It's how we transitioned when we moved from an apt to a house.  When we established to our berner that the front door of the house was the same as the patio and that's where he did his business he picked it up quick."

Unfortunately, it will probably be quite some time before we get another dog. We weren't planning on getting a dog when she came into our lives, but things worked out well. Dealing with her loss has been rough, and the amount of we spent for her emergency vet care put quite a dent in our savings. I wouldn't feel right adopting a dog until we are fully back on our feet. All this experience has taught me how important it is to be prepared for emergencies.   Fortunately, we are watching a friend's dog for a couple months so we do have some company. I actually used to live with this dog so it's nice to have her around. I brought my cat home, too, after Nels passed. They are definitely helping me cope with the loss."

I mean I get the reason. It could be much more meaningful than just a ring or something... And become a nice addition to your family. But it's a huge commitment. Just keep in mind they really need a lot of attention. They like to be with their people and get depressed if left to themselves.  I'm sure you have good intentions and maybe a great environment too. I just want to make sure you know what you're committing to - and not just using this as a prop.  Sorry if I'm over analyzing this, but just making sure."

However, if she is anything like me (which she could very well be nothing like me) she might want to have a hand in picking out her puppy. My current fantasy plan is as follows:   Boyfriend says ""lets go to the breeder and pick out a berner! surprise!"" We go to breeder and bond with puppies and pick the perfect one Then boyfriend proposes   Obviously I have weirdly thought about this quite a bit. It might be a good idea to have you both pick out a puppy that you both love and can see in your future home is all that I am saying. However, whatever you decide to do, I wish you the best of luck! You are clearly awesome and husband worthy for thinking of proposing with a dog."

bernesemountaindogs,2rcqr3,BoomFoxxy,1 point,Tue Jan 6 00:05:34 2015 UTC,"Good luck with the proposal! I don't want to crap on your really sweet proposal idea, but BMD breeders can be intensely rigorous about placing their puppies. We had to fill out a long questionnaire and have an in-person interview before we were put on the waiting list for both of our puppies. I just want you to know what to expect.   That being said, I started my search my looking for breeders in states close-by or areas I was willing to drive to. Many breeders will not ship their pups. Usually all of the relevant information about price, litters, parents are available on their website, or you can look for local BMD clubs and see if they have any breeders they endorse. Finding a healthy bloodline is crucial, but doesn't guarantee good health. Our older dog is on a daily dose of steroids for a neurological disorder that didn't show up in the extensive DNA profile we were given. He was actually my wedding present from my husband (though not a surprise), and we picked him up while on our honeymoon."
bernesemountaindogs,2rcqr3,punchbag,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:54:25 2015 UTC,Love the idea. I got my pretty boy from BernerGardens. Not sure if they are going to have a litter any time soon but they might be able to get you in touch with good breeders in Michigan. One thing to think about is how old you want the puppy to be. Most (good) breeders won't let a puppy go to a home until they are about 10 weeks so you'll need a birth date of about March. (My math could be wrong)  Here is my boy Mötley!

bernesemountaindogs,2qt4wa,tom-the-cool,1 point,Sun Jan 25 21:36:33 2015 UTC,Depends on climate and situation. I am living in Ireland so it's not too warm during these months. The difference you see in that picture is really just a good brush and the hair that was trimmed was mostly on the back of her legs and bum. This was to keep her clean when she goes to the bathroom outside.

It's already been a trial raising a 9-week-old puppy, but she's shockingly smart and has already mostly figured out how to signal when she needs to go outside and has even slept through the night for the past two nights (if you can call waking up at 6am and staying up sleeping through the night). She's also finally beginning to be interested in chewing her toys instead of just chewing on our clothes, haha. :)"

bernesemountaindogs,2qhh4i,C_M_V,2,Sat Dec 27 02:02:51 2014 UTC,"Luckily she hasn't broken the skin yet for either of us :) She's learning ""drop it"" pretty quickly as well, as long as we have a treat on hand to exchange for the object we want her to drop. Also, if you haven't tried this yet, try yelping and ignoring her for a few seconds when she bites you. That's how puppies know that they're hurting other puppies and it has had a moderate success rate for us. A lot of the time she'll keep biting, just less hard, but if I keep yelping she'll eventually leave my hand/fingers alone. =P"

bernesemountaindogs,2m8ocw,mhaines8,3,Fri Nov 14 01:33:50 2014 UTC,"I've had my Berner for more than six years now. First, they do shed. They shed a lot. But with any dog you will always have dog hair. You learn to adjust. Second, when I first got him as a puppy I lived in an apartment and he did quite well. I will add however that he was taken daily to the dog park for exercise and socialization. I have only fed him one type of dog food his whole life and I attribute it to the good health he's had thusfar. Please remember ALL big dogs despite the breed have a high risk of having health problems. Don't kid yourself otherwise.   Third, despite what breed you choose, all dogs deserve/need/require a big time commitment. They are a big responsibility. If you aren't ready to commit to them, please wait until you are.  All that aside, despite the major fur, health risks, time (and money) having a BMD is absolutely rewarding. Never have I encountered a breed with as much beauty, gentleness and unconditional love as I have with these dogs."
bernesemountaindogs,2m8ocw,kthxbye23,2,Tue Nov 18 19:27:01 2014 UTC,Shedding can be managed by brushing. But there will be fur no matter what. Where ever there is dust in your home there will also be some fur.  Bernese don't do well in hot weather. They love to be in the snow. They lie there for hours. I couldn't get a berner if I didn't live in a place with 4-6 months of snow.   Mine loves to explore. Whenever we go some where new she pulls like crazy.
bernesemountaindogs,2m8ocw,TrueDisciphil,1 point,Fri Nov 14 01:47:05 2014 UTC,Swissys shed as well even though they are short haired.   They also get can get a little bigger than the Bernese my Swiss is 2 and 130 lbs.  I exercise him about a 40 minutes a day depending on what were doing and he calms down a lot after that but they are a working breed and are at home and happy if they have a job to do.
bernesemountaindogs,2m8ocw,skifish29,1 point,Fri Nov 14 16:02:03 2014 UTC,"I've got a 8 month old Bernese. He doesn't shed too bad, not like our dalmatian used to. He does shed profusely after a bath though.  I read that Berners were cuddly pups before I got one but I didn't realize just HOW affectionate they were. Mine loves to sit on my lap or on my feet. He doesn't do well when I go to work even though my mom watches him and he has her Welsh Corgi to play with.   I guess those would be my words of caution. If you get a Berner be sure you're ok with having an easily 100lb dog on your lap and know that they need attention. It would be tough on a Berner, any puppy really, if you weren't able to be home to take care of them.  Oh, and I have to feed raw. My boy doesn't stomach normal dog food well but after we switched him over to raw he hasn't had any problems. I've heard of a few other Berner owners who experienced this problem until their dogs were a bit older but I wouldn't go as far to say it's common."
bernesemountaindogs,2m8ocw,BoomFoxxy,1 point,Mon Nov 17 17:59:12 2014 UTC,"I know your didnt ask about this but be careful of who you buy your Bernese from. A lot of people in past couple of years have been experiencing health problems with US bred ones, most likely the result of inbreeding."
bernesemountaindogs,2m7djk,Mygruffalo,3,Thu Nov 13 18:53:25 2014 UTC,"When our Berner was a puppy, our trainer recommended clipping his leash on while at the park multiple times, rewarding him for sitting still and behaving and then letting him off to play again.  The rationale was that the leash clipping signaled the end of ""fun time"" so he was likely to act out. Perhaps that would help?"
bernesemountaindogs,2m7djk,GrnGlob,3,Thu Nov 13 19:21:05 2014 UTC,"Thank you that's a good idea.  I've been calling him over for belly rubs and then sending him back to play, but it never occurred to me to put in the leash and take it off.  Thank you again"

bernesemountaindogs,2m7djk,Goldie2000,1 point,Fri Nov 14 14:54:49 2014 UTC,"My 8 month old gets really ramped up at things like our agility class or off-leash play. If he doesn't get enough time to get it all out of his system (usually after our short morning walks) he keeps acting kind of like a wild monster. He'll jump onto the couch, run down the stairs, back up on the couch, ext. I'd suggest a little more time at the park perhaps if he doesn't show signs of getting tired before you leave the park but an hour should be enough to wear him out if he is running around and playing.  I like the idea of positively reinforcing the leashing. Then it won't always mean the end of fun. He could definitely be acting up at the idea of not wanting to leave the park.  I've also been told by a few other owners that the jumping, nipping and barking can be common at this age and that they tend to grow it out by the time they hit a year or just after.   I would advise against taking him to a park open to public areas if you aren't 100% sure he will come back to you on recall. I know it's tough with the days being shorter but perhaps just an on-leash walk might be best in the mornings. If you do need to take the risk I carry a little tupperware dish with dog treats in it to reinforce the fact that if he comes back to me he'll get a treat. He knows the sound of me shaking the treats which helps him in deciding if he's going to come back to me or not..."

bernesemountaindogs,2lrb6x,trullard,1 point,Sun Nov 9 12:53:37 2014 UTC,Good question.  Not sure I have an answer for you.  We have a six month old Berner and two grown cats.  She'll try and get them to play with her but mostly they just ignore her.  She's never done anything to them - no mouthing or anything - so she's been taught well by them!  I think she'd love to have a kitten to play with but then she's grown up around cats.  Maybe introduce your Berner to a cat that knows how to be around dogs?  One good hissing standoff and a swipe at the nose and that should keep her from chasing cats!
bernesemountaindogs,2lrb6x,Goldie2000,2,Sun Nov 9 17:07:19 2014 UTC,"On a similar note, I don't want her to be afraid of cats. Our kitten-to-be is just a few weeks old, very kind hearted and playful, also she is living with a cat-friendly dog right now, she probably won't be very aggressive towards our berner."
bernesemountaindogs,2lrb6x,Goldie2000,1 point,Sun Nov 9 17:17:38 2014 UTC,"Our Liesl is definitely not afraid of our cats, they just won't have anything to do with her.  She goes around sniffing their butts and occasionally barking at them when they're in their cat trees.  They ignore her.  I'm very interested to see what happens when she grows older and calms down.  It maybe that they'll cuddle with her then.  As normally our cats are quite big cuddlers.  It maybe that a kitten will prove a bit much for your grown Berner but in time they will grow into each other.  Do you have the ability to do a supervised visit?  See how they get along?"
bernesemountaindogs,2lrb6x,Radeeku,2,Sun Nov 9 17:31:06 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the kitten was born to my friend's cat, they live close to us so I could bring the cat here any day, probably going to do it next week. The mommy cat still feeds the kitten, that's why I haven't took her already."
