Colts,3e5fyh,waynewideopenTD,4,Wed Jul 22 02:33:43 2015 UTC,"This is essentially a bold predictions article, and that is a fairly bold one. I do appreciate the author's willingness to make a prediction that isn't being commonly said, but I don't think this one is going to come true.  Over the last 3 years, Cole has averaged just under 6 sacks. He hasn't had 10 or more since the 2011 season. Mathis, on the other hand, has averaged over 12 sacks over his last 3 seasons played, and when he was last on the field he had 19.5 - he's been significantly more successful in recent years at getting the quarterback down.  Trent is also brand new to the team, whereas Robert has been playing here for over a decade. He has the advantage of knowing the team and its coaches and schemes inside and out. Cole may need a period of adjustment, but Mathis has his place established and has for years.  Of course, Robert's big issue is the injury return. If he can't come back or comes back playing at a low level, then obviously Trent's chances of having a bigger impact go way up. But if he's healthy, it's going to be tough sledding for any of the other pass-rushers to be better than he is. He's just exceptional.  If this prediction had a disclaimer for Mathis' health, I'd like it a lot more. But if he isn't hampered by injury, I have a hard time seeing Trent Cole having a larger impact."
Colts,3e3gwi,Dammit-,31,Tue Jul 21 17:46:19 2015 UTC,/r/NFL is losing its mind over Luck's ranking. Go to the thread over there for a good laugh.

Maybe he meant not #3 good, but that's just a straight up idiotic thing to say.

If Wilson didn't exist they wouldn't be holding Luck to such a ridiculous standard.

We're 12-0 the last two years and I swear people point to those games every time our record or Luck's stats are brought up. Divisional games aren't easy for any division.

Colts,3e28lk,nate_oh84,4,Tue Jul 21 12:39:54 2015 UTC,"Indy native here. Really glad you're making the trek to our fair city.  As /u/JaCrispy_Vulcano mentioned, there is the Colts Grille downtown. I've never been as I've heard mixed things about it. Plus, on game day, it's always crowded as hell. Pretty much any bar down there is going to be busy, but there are some diamonds if you know where to look.  The Slippery Noodle Inn is the oldest bar in Indianapolis. It's a stone's throw from LOS and always has a party going on come game day. I would also recommend checking it out the night before as there's always live music.  My personal recommendation would be Tavern on South. It's a more recent addition to the area which serves all local brews on tap and has some excellent food.  Frankly, if you're going to the game, I would walk around the stadium and see about some tailgating with the other fans! Early November can be a crapshoot weather-wise. It's probably going to be cold, but whether there is snow, rain, mixed, sunshine, wind... who the hell knows. But rest assured there will be tailgating going on for sure! (I have a pretty cool tailgate I try to go to before each home game. It's invite only, but I could probably get you in. Send me an inbox message and we'll see about going!)  As for other things to see in the city, it mostly depends on where you are staying and if you have transportation. If you're downtown, you're within walking distance of quite a few museums and cultural areas that are very cool.  Hope some of that helps!"

They didn't need a receiver, so their draft was bad. Do they bother looking at any of our other picks? Of course not.  They signed older veterans in free agency. Does it matter that they were signed to non-threatening, short-term deals? Nope!  I know this is just a short summary of each team's offseason moves, but assigning us a C- grade for what we've done is ridiculous. We should not be closer to an F than an A."

If you don't get drafted, then you are not able to get placed back into the draft pool and you become a UDFA."

Colts,3e0hwr,Aleph_Alpha_001,2,Tue Jul 21 02:19:02 2015 UTC,"This is about where I rated our pickups. If the 49ers didn't want Gore any more he can't have much left in the tank. Plus, they ran much more often than we do with a much better O line. IMO he doesn't bust 1000 yards.  Andre Johnson dropped off by about 500 yards last year from 2013. He is in a SHARP decline and probably will not be a #1 WR here.  Trent Cole has had his sack totals diminish each of the last three years. Why this doesn't bother Grigson I will never know.  Herremans has missed 2 halfs of the last three seasons and was also on a steady decline by all accounts.  Malcolm Brown won't even make the team..  Dorsett only had 36 catches as a senior and there were starting calibur DTs and safeties available. If father time is cruel we will be in full rebuild mode AGAIN. Next year."
Colts,3e0hwr,SpiritDuplicator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:10 2015 UTC,"Andre is our #2 receiver, so you're right that he won't be #1. (But he is going to be very good here.)  Idk about Herrimans, and I don't think that Grigs has done that well in free agency, really. He's had a lot of misses on the o-line and d-line.  Gore will be a big upgrade if his body continues to hold up, and there's no real reason to assume that it won't. He hasn't been injury-prone throughout his career.  And although I was as skeptical of using our first pick on a wideout as anybody, it worked out pretty well with Reggie Wayne. Dorsett looks to be a special talent."

Colts,3dysgy,orrrderup,3,Mon Jul 20 19:03:45 2015 UTC,Yes. We can be happy to sign Andre Johnson while understanding why it might frustrate some Houston fans. And we can simultaneously hope that one of OUR favorite players doesn't sign with OUR least favorite team. It doesn't make us hypocrites--why wouldn't we root against the same thing that happened to Texans fans happening to us?  No one is saying that they would hate him for his decision or anything. He's universally loved around here. It's just that it would be depressing if he went to the Pats (just like it was depressing for a lot of Texans fans when Andre signed with us).
Colts,3dwfsq,Samuel_the_First,5,Mon Jul 20 02:35:01 2015 UTC,If he goes to New England I have a feeling we will feel the way Houston does about Johnson.  I want to root for Wayne wherever he goes but I don't know if I could if he is receiving from Brady.
Colts,3dwfsq,ClipClopMotherLucker,-4,Mon Jul 20 02:36:44 2015 UTC,Houston doesn't get to feel the way about Dre coming here that we get to feel about Wayne going there.  The comparison is not even close. Dre left a JV team for a shot at a ring.  Reggie will have left Hogwarts to join Darth Hitler.
Colts,3dwfsq,thursdae,8,Mon Jul 20 05:13:16 2015 UTC,"That's a biased view on the situation if I've ever seen it. Ignores the fact that Dre was the first star player, first major face of our franchise. Majority of folks I had talked to knew he would be leaving and, myself included, planned on backing his next team in hopes he would get a ring before retiring, since he deserves it. But him going to you guys, a divisional rival, means that to do so would be actively cheering against our own team. It sucks."
Colts,3dwfsq,HanaHonu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:32:49 2015 UTC,"I think his view was somewhat unfair; it would certainly be hard to claim that going to NE wasn't about a ring (considering they were the last team to win one). And I get the love for AJ80 in Houston. But I still think Reggie had a really special place in the hearts of Indy fans, because of who he was and not just his production. Then going to Foxboro where there's so much hatred...it would just be brutal to see his in that uniform."

Colts,3dwfsq,LazarusLongest,-4,Mon Jul 20 06:32:23 2015 UTC,"He wasn't going to be catching anything in Houston. You may not be keeping up with current events but he was released by Houston, and you'll see why as the season progresses. He could have gone to a real contender but instead he tried to be a dick and cut off his nose to spite his face."
Colts,3dwfsq,Z-Tay,2,Mon Jul 20 07:11:35 2015 UTC,"What? You don't even make sense.  You don't think Texans wanted to keep Johnson? THEY let HIM go?  Right.  As far as the whole ""real contender"" thing, just stop. You sound bitter."
Colts,3dwfsq,iammattchambers,0,Mon Jul 20 08:13:37 2015 UTC,"What? You don't even make sense.   Okay, let's take a look at that.   You don't think Texans wanted to keep Johnson? THEY let HIM go? Right.   Okay, that one's just a statement of fact.   As far as the whole ""real contender"" thing, just stop. You sound bitter.   Normally, teams that aren't paying out the ass for a QB are able to use their money to field a more competent, well rounded team. You guys were 2-4 against playoff teams last year. That doesn't even count other playoff quality teams like the Eagles, who you lost to as well.  So, congrats. Your ""contender"" is great at beating up the Jags, the Titans, and us (but I'm not so sure that'll be the case this year.) If you guys were in just a competitive division where you split your series, you finish the year at 8-8.  Contender my ass. Your days are numbered. Luck is going to have to get paid some time soon, and your roster is going to suffer because of it - it's bloated as is with a lot of offensive prowess, but a defense NE will stomp all over in the playoffs. So, enjoy being the best team in the worst division in football - your ceiling will always be NE."
Colts,3dwfsq,Z-Tay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:56:25 2015 UTC,You guys were 2-4 against playoff teams last year.    Colts are 5-1 against Texans since Luck has been here. You should be more worried about that than some arbitrary stat about our record vs. playoff teams.   Contender my ass. Your days are numbered.   Right. Have fun fighting for that last wild card spot for the next decade.
Colts,3dwfsq,iammattchambers,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"What's the plan to re-sign Luck? In all likelihood, he's probably going to become the highest paid player in the leauge. You're looking at at least $25 million/year - especially if Wilson resigns first. How would it feel to have 18 million fewer dollars in cap space? That would mean no Andre, no Trent Cole, no Frank Gore. (And that's just because of Luck - don't even get me started on TY's future contract.)  You've been surviving as a team off of the backs of a lot of young players on rookie deals. And you're going to have to sacrifice a lot of that talent you've acquired to retain the homegrown pieces you've collected. So, 5-1 is okay with me for now. Enjoy your place at the top of the mountain while you can - you'll feel different when you're regularly being swept by the Jaguars for the next 10 years."
Colts,3dwfsq,Victory33,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"Actually we were 4-5 against playoff teams....since we actually went to the playoffs and you know, won two games. There is no promise we would have to play NE every year, the Ravens almost eliminated them this year and would have had to play us at home, where they lost earlier in the year. I agree we aren't Superbowl favorites, but to not call us contenders is silly. We've beaten the Niners, Seahawks, Packers, Broncos, etc. in their primes the last 3 years....but yes, I wouldn't pick us in a head to head match against the Pats either."
Colts,3dwfsq,LazarusLongest,-3,Mon Jul 20 16:16:42 2015 UTC,"He was under contract. If they wanted to keep him, they would have. You don't  understand how contracts work?    The Texans told him to expect a reduced role equivalent to his impact, and he expressed his delusion of his value. Rather than have another year of an unhappy Andre costing us games with dropped passes and phantom hits causing him to fumble, they released him. Delusions appears to be welcome there so it sounds like a match made in heaven. Good luck with that."
Colts,3dwfsq,Z-Tay,0,Mon Jul 20 13:17:36 2015 UTC,"No, what happened is he got discouraged playing for annual bums and I can't blame him one bit. He still got nearly 1,000 yards with a QB whose name I can't even remember on a team that hasn't beat the Colts since Luck's rookie year."
Colts,3dwfsq,LazarusLongest,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:28:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm going to trust someone that didn't even know that we released Andre to give me the lowdown.  So I'm assuming that you believe Andre will get 2000 yards this year since he'll have such a great QB with a name that you can remember throwing the ball to him.  Delusional."
Colts,3dwfsq,ClipClopMotherLucker,-3,Tue Jul 21 04:15:28 2015 UTC,"Good effort, bro! You'll hit it next time!"
Colts,3dwfsq,YoungNasteyman,2,Mon Jul 20 12:03:27 2015 UTC,"Man am I really the only one not bothered by where he goes? Like the team is better with Andre than with Regi. I just don't think he's got a healthy season left without some luck. He's put in his time with us, if he wants to still play by all means go for it. I'll still always have huge respect and admiration for him even if he's a Patriot.  There's a reason it's taken so long to draw some interest. He only wants to go to a championship ready team it seems, but i'm not so sure top caliber teams want/need him.   I wish he would just go ahead and retire, don't be like Rice and fizzle out."

The buddy I was working with is as big of a Bears fan as I am a Colts fan... and the noise died down JUST ENOUGH for me to yell, 'HEY REGGIE... WAVE AT THE BEARS FAN' while I pointed at my buddy.

Colts,3dovb4,SilentGinger89,14,Sat Jul 18 01:15:01 2015 UTC,"I""ll tell you this...if Andre Johnson, Dorsett, and/or Moncrief put up huge numbers this upcoming season, Hilton won't have much of a leg to stand on. As of right now, he was our huge weapon and everyone knows it. But if it turns out we can do without him, he'll either walk or take a smaller deal. I personally don't want to see him leave. I hate the business side of football."
Colts,3dovb4,iced_hero,5,Sat Jul 18 05:08:28 2015 UTC,"I hate to agree with you, but I have to. We have great potential in Moncrief/Dorsett/Carter with Andre Johnson helping out. One of those young 3 can certainly take the role of the big time playmaker. Hilton has to put up some serious numbers, IMO, to be a part of this team next season. I'm just going to forget about this situation until the Colts deal with it, because it sucks.  The only positive thing that can come out of T.Y. leaving is getting to keep both Allen and Fleener. If we keep Hilton, there's no way we will have the expense to get both TE's."
Colts,3dovb4,FuckMeRunning5648,5,Sat Jul 18 05:41:47 2015 UTC,"Hilton won't have much of a leg to stand on   That's if he really wants to play for the Colts. If he just wants to chase the money, he's not gonna have a hard time whatsoever finding a team who is going to give him 11mil+."
Colts,3dovb4,Citizen_Snip,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:23:03 2015 UTC,"True. But then it becomes a question of how bad does he want to win or perform in playoffs, because right now all strong contending teams are saturated with elite WRs. So either he goes to a team like Oakland, Jags, Browns, and other alike for money or he stays with Colts where he will get spotlight. He's young. So it's not like he can go to a lower team and build that WR up. Let's also take into account he's short. He doesn't really contest vs elite CBs or Safeties (unless he gets past them then he's hard to catch up to with his speed)."
Colts,3dovb4,iced_hero,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:54:21 2015 UTC,"Dorsett and Moncrief being on the team means that the Colts don't have to overpay Hilton, so yeah, he won't have leverage. He's gonna ask for a lot so it's hard to see him staying on the team."
Colts,3dovb4,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:12 2015 UTC,"Yes and yes. But I think logic will prevail over ambition for Hilton. He knows he's not caliber enough to go to another strong team bc they're all stacked with elite WRs. So his only two options will be 1) to go to a lesser team for more money but practically no chance for a ring or 2) stay with the Colts for less money but a bright chance at winning it all. Besides, if he chooses to stay with the Colts that will win the people over bc it will be seen as a decision coming from loyalty rather than ambition."
Colts,3dovb4,iced_hero,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:00 2015 UTC,True! Football is more fun when you're winning. He likely doesn't want to leave Luck and the winning culture in Indi.
Colts,3dovb4,JaquiskiTaterTartt,6,Tue Jul 21 15:36:05 2015 UTC,I personally think that he will have a great season this year and ask for more money than he is worth and then sign with a team willing to pay him what he is asking for.

Colts,3dovb4,pmwood25,2,Sat Jul 18 02:58:54 2015 UTC,"I think I agree with you, OP. I'd prefer to pay him in the $10M-$11M/year region, but I fear we might need to pay him at least $12M to keep him on the team, and I don't know if we'll have that much when we also need to pay Luck, Fleener, Allen, etc. Depending on the cost (I don't know off the top of my head), I could see us franchising him if need be. I've been on the boat that it's a stupid assumption to say that we drafted Dorsett to replace TY, but I guess we'll see how he fits that role this year."
Colts,3dovb4,AaronAlley,5,Sat Jul 18 03:13:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know man. I fucking love TY, but if we offer him 11 mil, and he wants to dip because another team is going to give him 12 mil, see ya. That just means we get to keep both TE."
Colts,3dovb4,Citizen_Snip,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:02:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, sir. I would LOVE to keep Fleener and Allen if T.Y. bails."

I don't want to lose either one, but let's face it, neither is an ""A+"" grade tight end, for various reasons. They are way more replaceable than TY.   But we'll see what happens this season. Could be we have new superstars."
Colts,3dovb4,Snatch_Pastry,3,Sat Jul 18 06:08:54 2015 UTC,"The biggest contract outside of TY is going to be Castonzo. Depending on how much we can get TY and Castonzo for, we may be able to keep both. If TY wants to go elsewhere for even more money, we can definitely keep both TE."

Colts,3dovb4,thelonerick,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:01:23 2015 UTC,I don't think we have to pay Luck for two more years since we exercised his fifth year option.
Colts,3dovb4,yellowlikegold,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:00:33 2015 UTC,Luck's cost will just keep increasing the more we wait to sign his new contract.
Colts,3dovb4,cavall1215,2,Sat Jul 18 17:05:14 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, but I think it's more about the timing and not having to sign him the same year as TY, Fleenor, and Allen."
Colts,3dovb4,yellowlikegold,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:16:36 2015 UTC,I think Allen has the better potential at TE but Fleener is the better one atm and safer pick. I have a feeling that soon it will be Dwayne Allen starting for Green Bay
Colts,3dovb4,charlos72,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:06:52 2015 UTC,Even $10M is going to hurt their ability to sign defensive players.
Colts,3dovb4,Big_Baby_Jesus_,2,Sat Jul 18 08:18:47 2015 UTC,"He's going to have to make a choice. Does he want the money or does he want to win? Hopefully he can balance both and stay with the Colts. I'd offer 5 years - 55 million. He knows we have one of the best QBs in the game already and the team is only getting better. We're a constant playoff team. Would an extra 3 million a year be worth running to a lower tier team this early in his career? I hope not, T.Y. I hope not. I don't think anyone would throw Dez money at him anyway."
Colts,3dovb4,Inframidi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:29:59 2015 UTC,10-12 should get it done. Any more and we gotta let him walk. Any less and I'd be thrilled.
Colts,3dovb4,waynewideopenTD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:30:35 2015 UTC,If we get him for 10 or less I'll kiss my Grigson shrine and buy another T.Y. jersey.
Colts,3dovb4,Inframidi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:35:14 2015 UTC,"Just some numbers for context:  Assuming the cap continues to rise to 150 mil, we currently have about 26 mil in cap space for next season. Call it 20 once we sign new rookies. But we also can cut a few people and get a lot more space. If we get rid of Gosder, Walden, and Thomas, we have another 11.8 to work with. Assuming Luck gets a new deal, we replace his 16.1 with say, 23. So we have about 31 mil to retain Hilton, Castonzo, and our TEs as well as sign any free agents.  Figures taken from spotrac. LMK if any are wrong, I'm hungover."
Colts,3dovb4,pooponapoptart,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:47:09 2015 UTC,"Hilton's contract should look about like Antonio Brown's (5 years, ~$42 mil). But Bryant and Thomas set the bar a little higher. If he thinks he's worth that kind of money, Hilton should immediately be drug tested.  Plus Hilton isn't likely to see his numbers improve this year. His usage rate will stay the same, and could even go down with all the other options the Colts appear to have on offense."
Colts,3dovb4,ereller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:15:29 2015 UTC,"List of WR salaries  Honestly I wouldn't pay him over 10. Some of the upper ones look like they're either backloaded right now because the receiver isn't great or some are playing below their contract since they signed it. That aside, he's not as good as neither Nelson not Cobb, or Desean Jackson."
Colts,3dovb4,-o-Y-o-Y-o-Y-o-Y,6,Sat Jul 18 06:07:13 2015 UTC,What? You don't think T.Y. is as good as Desean Jackson? That's crazy talk.
Colts,3dovb4,2600forlife,2,Sat Jul 18 08:19:21 2015 UTC,"Well I saw the question posted, was Ty putting up those numbers because we didn't have that great of talent around in and he's got luck? I think it would be foolish to chase money when we can give him competitive football for several years. If we can manage to pay 5 years 50 mil with 30 guaranteed or some sort of incentives in it I think he should stay. I trust Grigson to get it done and keep us in good shape. I also agree that we didn't draft Dorset to replace him."

Colts,3dovb4,CanlStillBeGarth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:37:54 2015 UTC,I think he's better than Cobb too.
Colts,3dovb4,2600forlife,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:25:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trade TY for Jackson or Cobb. He's got a chip on his shoulder now, since the Colts wouldn't give him the extension he wanted, and with the other weapons we have now he's going to see a lot less double coverage. I expect him to have huge season and then want to get paid (and I don't blame him for that).   Somebody will pay him if the Colts won't/can't. Anybody who thinks we'll keep him for Cobb money, is kidding themselves. Maybe we could get him for Wallace money, but that's about it, if he has the kind of season I think he'll have."
Colts,3dovb4,2600forlife,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:00:43 2015 UTC,"Never said that he wouldn't get paid, I was saying I think realistically that he deserves Cobb type money. I think anything over is too much for what I think he's worth. But I can easily see him getting a bigger contract and walking and I wouldn't blame him. However I think if we have him a Cobb type contract he would be foolish not to take it and stay with the colts. Comes down to what he think he's worth and if he wants to play with the best young qb and compete for titles."

Colts,3dnate,redbluegreenyellow,6,Fri Jul 17 17:49:39 2015 UTC,I would love to see him play in Denver or Oakland. I think he could really help out Amari Cooper and Derek Carr.
Colts,3dnate,Upuser,2,Fri Jul 17 18:09:57 2015 UTC,I never considered Oakland I guess he would probably prefer a warmer climate. I think them or the Jags too. They have a very young receiving core and he could help teach Allen Robinson (who I had hoped we'd draft out of PSU).
Colts,3dnate,ereller,6,Fri Jul 17 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"Considering he hasn't signed with a team yet, I'd wager that the interest is from teams that aren't contenders and want a veteran in the locker room."

I've heard all the reasons and run through them in my head, and he's worth a few million dollars for a single year contract so he can play it out as a Colt.  I'm just not buying any of the bullshit reasons for not re-signing him, I fucking hate that we haven't.  It's a goddamn disgrace.  He stuck around, took less money, sacrificed a chance for an end-career championship and helped build Andrew Luck up, he deserves his fucking Kobe contract and shame on the entire organization for not giving it to him.

I think this is a bit hyperbolic; he doesn't have to hold the no. 1 spot, but he could definitely take snaps on 3rd and short situations where he's been so clutch, or come in late game, before the half.  We can sign him and not run him into the ground by sacrificing snaps going to younger guys by keeping him on the field for 60 minutes.  Ultimately though, I'm at the point where I don't care where he goes as long as it isn't New England or San Diego.  Hell, he could go to the Texans.  It'll make that little rivalry so much more dynamic for a season or two (plus we could just swap Reggie and Andre around when we play each other for one game and it'd be like old times, right down to the Texans losing in Indianapolis)"
Colts,3dnate,maxgarzo,8,Fri Jul 17 18:00:47 2015 UTC,"For a potential maximum of what, a year?   That's quite a lot of snaps bro. And you still ignore the fact that it'd be a waste of a roster spot carrying that many WRs. I'd much rather we give it to a young defensive player than an aged WR who would get limited snaps and take away valuable playing time from Crief and Dorsett."
Colts,3dnate,vivalapants,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:10:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you just said 100%.  Absolutely nothing to counter with except I still think it's hyperbole to say signing Reggie means none of our younger guys will get experience.  They absolutely would.    Perhaps at a lower snap rate statistically, but there would still be immense value in Reggie being there and these guys would definitely learn from him in training camp and at practice.   Still, I agree with you it wouldn't be worth it to hedge a roster spot on the probability of Reggie creating another monster like he did with TY (or maybe TY was just destined to be the breakout from the beginning anyway...God Lombardi doesn't play Keno with the universe so meh)"
Colts,3dnate,ae_syn89,0,Fri Jul 17 18:19:19 2015 UTC,We could make the space. It's disgraceful to not let him finish here when he wants to.
Colts,3dnate,vivalapants,3,Fri Jul 17 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"So you'd rather give a roster spot to an aging declining vet WR when we are stacked at WR over a young defensive guy (where we need depth).  Boy am I glad you aren't the GM. That's how you run teams into the ground. There may be reasons to re-sign Reggie in certain situations. ""We can make room"" isn't one of them."
Colts,3dnate,ae_syn89,-2,Fri Jul 17 21:49:44 2015 UTC,Theres a few spots with some backups we could dump. Shit WR for WR. Dump Carter. Oh wait this sub thinks he's Marvin Harrison already
Colts,3dnate,longlivethepharoh,3,Fri Jul 17 22:04:25 2015 UTC,"Carter may not even make the 53 man roster. Either way, I don't know why you would drop a young WR with potential for an old vet when you are already stacked and have needs for depth elsewhere. If WR wasn't our most talented and deep position I'd agree with you.  And as far as dropping other guys at different positions...who? We need depth at virtually every position except QB and WR."

There are different versions of Cricket that are played at international level.   T-20 lasts probably the same length of time as a baseball game.

Colts,3dkrie,KappnDingDong,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:30:37 2015 UTC,"Actually, attendance numbers for MLS games is on the rise.  TV ratings are topping the MLB and NBA, internationally hosted games are selling out, even when they aren't our teams.  Soccer is the only sport to buy stock in right now.  Even the NFL is on hold, it's reaching its plateau.  The NBA is too inconsistent and dependent on which teams are in the playoffs, and the MLB is losing viewership because of how boring it is.  After that, what's next?  The problem is soccer doesn't have enough breaks in play.  It is a sport that anything can happen if you're not paying attention because it's non stop.  Every other American sport is riddled with time stoppages and breaks.  The NFL was super smart and realized people get invested in fabricated competition.  The MLB and NBA followed suit.  And what I mean by fabricated competition is games feel more competitive the longer they last.  A 4 hour NFL game feels like it's something because it's drawn out, but there's less than 15 minutes of any substantial gameplay.  An MLB game lasts long enough to induce child birth.  It creates the illusion of tougher competition, it creates drama.  It connects the viewer to the game.  Soccer matches last an hour and a half, done.  I can guarantee you if play was broken up more and matches were more drawn out, this country would be even more interested.  The NFL reigns supreme in America for one reason only.  One and done playoffs.  There are no series, you win or go home.  It's drama inducing.  It's a ""live or die"" mentality that Americans have been indoctrinated to appeal to.  The NFL will never relinquish its grasp as the top sport in this country for this reason alone.  The NFL can make 2 simple changes to retain its grasp on American viewership while creating a more appealing product overseas.  The clock can only run off 10 seconds on running plays before stopping again, and the play clock gets reduced to 30 seconds.  The game would be much better for it."

A game that has constant action for an hour and a half with a short half time is much more interesting to me.  I don't care if the game ends in a tie, but when one team is playing for a tie, that can be a bit frustrating for me.

Colts,3di49f,ajsmitty,3,Thu Jul 16 19:13:40 2015 UTC,"Nicks, in the proud line of Donnie Avery and DHB, is a perfect example of the fact that a low-risk, low-reward signing can hurt the team if they take snaps away from better players."
Colts,3di49f,slash196,2,Fri Jul 17 12:49:54 2015 UTC,"What bothers me a bit about it is that Sanders got almost the exact same amount but for three years instead of one. I guess the team didn't want to commit to either FA WR, but now a 34 year old Dre gets 3 years and 21MM? Seems like we could've paid a bit more than what Nicks got for Sanders and saved money in the long run, as well as picked up a younger and more productive WR.  Now, who knows what the FO thought of Sanders. But he definitely played better than Nicks last season. Johnson is the first FA WR we've committed to since the reload (Avery, DHB, Nicks all got one year deals iirc). Just not sure why we passed on Sanders when a multi year WR deal was on the table."
Colts,3di49f,waynewideopenTD,5,Thu Jul 16 15:40:07 2015 UTC,"Sanders never looked that amazing with Pittsburg and had major health concerns. Everyone thought his level of play would go up with Peyton, but I don't think many people saw him becoming as good as he did.  People also thought Nicks just needed a change of scenery and was going to come back to form with us. It's hard to make the best decision every time."
Colts,3di49f,bburchibanez,5,Thu Jul 16 17:56:53 2015 UTC,"Well, though not super impressive, Nicks was more productive coming into free agency than Sanders. I'm not sure how the front office determines who has more upside but to me it was clear that Sanders was ramping up for some good years ahead and what do you know. He had one with Peyton last year. The only conclusion I can draw is the Colts knew within a few year span they were going to draft a good WR (Dorsett) and just needed someone to tide them over until then which is why they got Nicks. Sanders could have done the job though at a discounted price but I think the Colts were playing it safe at the time."

Colts,3dhg52,garethom,19,Thu Jul 16 08:28:54 2015 UTC,That statement has never been true. I've seen the guy pull in some impossible catches. The 2 point conversion against the Texans when Luck laced it by two defenders comes to mind immediately. But then he goes and does things like this. Those easy catches make it seem like he drops a lot of balls but he's pretty consistent. He just needs to stay out of his head when being wide open like that.  P.S. I love me some Jack Doyle.  Edit: had the wrong play for the drop. Changed it. Damn 5 am replies.
Colts,3dhg52,Inframidi,7,Thu Jul 16 09:01:44 2015 UTC,NFL.com mirror: Indianapolis Colts tight end Coby Fleener's 2-pt conversion
Colts,3dhg52,NFLVideoConverterBot,5,Thu Jul 16 09:03:04 2015 UTC,Forgot all about that 2pt conversion. He had no business catching that football. Amazing.
Colts,3dhg52,waynewideopenTD,3,Thu Jul 16 15:26:17 2015 UTC,Doyle has got those east-side roots
Colts,3dhg52,mulebeast,3,Thu Jul 16 13:47:00 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. As somebody that functions better sports-wise when making snap decisions than knowing something is ""easy"", I totally get why things like his drop against Washington happen."
Colts,3dhg52,Victory33,7,Thu Jul 16 09:16:15 2015 UTC,50 targets isn't exactly a great sample size. Allen had like one horrible game where he dropped like 3 or 4 passes but he wasn't that bad his whole career. Plus he does a bunch of things that Fleener doesn't like pass and run block. Fleener plays more like a receiver and Allen plays more like a traditional tight end that every team needs.
Colts,3dhg52,NOTtrentRICHARDSON,3,Thu Jul 16 11:29:44 2015 UTC,OP wasn't talking about blocking or anything else other than drops. Of which Allen has 1 more drop than Fleener on 40 less targets.
Colts,3dhg52,Victory33,7,Thu Jul 16 11:50:53 2015 UTC,"He goes on to talk about letting Allen go...which I think would be a huge mistake because of his other skills. And all drops aren't equal at the end of the day, we don't care as much about a 5 yard screen pass as we do about a wide open TD. Allen had honestly had like 50+% of his drops in one game, I'm not worried about him going forward and Fleener seems to be getting it together too."
Colts,3dhg52,Victory33,2,Thu Jul 16 12:04:53 2015 UTC,"He goes on to talk about letting Allen go...which I think would be a huge mistake because of his other skills.    OP here. I also think it would be a mistake, but sometimes needs must. I hope, and have a feeling that we'll be able to keep both, but if needs must, I'm going with the guy who has proved to be the better receiver in a pass heavy offence and has proved he can stay on the field more.  I also debate that every team NEEDS a guy who is great at blocking too. Julius Thomas wasn't known for his blocking, but Denver did pretty well under his watch. New Orleans O did just fine with Jimmy Graham. It'd be great if we could find a Gronk clone, but if you've got such a pass heavy offence, it wouldn't be a priority of mine if we had to keep 2 of Fleener, Allen and Doyle."
Colts,3dhg52,Tophloaf,3,Thu Jul 16 12:10:46 2015 UTC,"For every Julius Thomas there was a guy like Jacob Tamme that was having to come in and block in certain packages because Thomas couldn't do it well enough. But when we bring in Allen to do that role, teams can't get to Luck as easy or guarantee that we are running the ball because he also adds his receiving abilities which were amazing in the redzone and he also was solid at getting YAC. I like having the double threat at TE, it gives up options all over the field....Doyle ain't adding that, he is a dime a dozen player that could be cut before the season and we wouldn't miss a beat."
Colts,3dhg52,prollynotathrowaway,2,Thu Jul 16 12:43:42 2015 UTC,"You don't need to convince me! Like I said, although it may appear that way at times, this wasn't meant as a knock on Dwayne Allen, more a defence of Coby Fleener.  I think for me, it boils down to Fleener being a better, or at least just as good, pass catcher (including in the red zone) as Allen and having shown that he can be relied on to stay healthy. Ideally, we keep both.  I think the fact that they play so well with each other might keep their value down. They aren't a singular threat at the position. Where people like Julius Thomas were the focal point at TE for the Broncos, so got 12/13 TDs and a tonne of yards, Allen and Fleener split the stats, so that might make them a bit cheaper come renewal."
Colts,3dhg52,de_la_Seoul,4,Thu Jul 16 13:00:51 2015 UTC,We call him BUTTERFLEENERS at our house!
Colts,3dhg52,de_la_Seoul,3,Thu Jul 16 18:04:37 2015 UTC,Great write up and really interesting as well. I do love me some Dwayne but I'd honestly probably keep Fleener if it was my call to make. I don't doubt Allen would excel if he could stay healthy but at this point it's too hard to believe he'll be able to do that. Also you have the chemistry factor at play since Luck and Fleener have been together since Kennedy was president. No doubt Luck can create chemistry with any receiver given time but  there's something to be said about the chemistry he already has with Fleener.
Colts,3dhg52,maxgarzo,3,Thu Jul 16 10:37:17 2015 UTC,"Just looking at raw drop rates isn't really the best measure of figuring out whether or not a guy is a good receiver. Game context matters a lot. Which drops come as a result of a hit? Was it a miracle to begin with just that he got his hands on the ball? There aren't really stats on this. Even then, a pass catcher produces more receptions if he can get open and has 15% more opportunities even if he drops passes 10% more frequently than his counterpart. If you want to talk about just raw rate-, opponent-, and context-adjusted production stats, Football Outsiders' DYAR is probably the best publicly available stat out there. This rates Fleener and Allen very closely (Coby has the slight edge). If there really was a situation where only one could stay on the roster, I would be surprised if receiving talent was the determining factor. I think we should leave Jack Doyle out of this discussion, as he's the very definition of a replacement-level tight end in the NFL."
Colts,3dhg52,jakyap,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"Again, the main point of this is that Coby Fleener does not particularly drop a lot of passes."
Colts,3dhg52,bigbassdaddy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:59:14 2015 UTC,I agree. I was just noting that his drop rate on its own doesn't really mean anything.
Colts,3dhg52,waynewideopenTD,2,Thu Jul 16 17:31:33 2015 UTC,"I was just noting that his drop rate on its own doesn't really mean anything.   If all you're studying as a metric is ""how many drops did he have?"" full stop, then yeah it kind of does, and I think that's what /u/garethom is saying."
Colts,3dhg52,Sourdust2,2,Fri Jul 17 18:14:37 2015 UTC,I'm definitely guilty of making that remark. Prolly that drop in the redskins game has tainted me on his catching ability. Really like him though. Prolly just a case of the bad sticks out more than the good in recent memory.
Colts,3dhg52,waynewideopenTD,2,Thu Jul 16 10:42:04 2015 UTC,Nice post!  I never understood why Chicago let Olsen go.
Colts,3dhg52,CBate,2,Thu Jul 16 14:08:47 2015 UTC,"I really don't think Allen will cost as much to retain as many others do, especially if he misses time his season. I've often heard ""if Allen is injured at all this year, he's gone."" But I feel like the opposite is true. A player who misses time every season since his rookie year can't command too much on the open market. If he's out 4 games with injury, I bet his asking price becomes affordable. Maybe not if TY wants a D&D deal, but Bluem has done well so far."

Colts,3dfa2d,captain-dingleberry,16,Wed Jul 15 20:36:22 2015 UTC,"If he thinks he should be getting paid the same as Dez, he's delusional.  We should pay him Cobb money.  If not, we should let him walk."
Colts,3dfa2d,seemoreglass83,11,Wed Jul 15 21:23:48 2015 UTC,Grigson must have seen this coming. Dorsett takes a lot of the leverage away from T.Y.
Colts,3dfa2d,CanlStillBeGarth,9,Wed Jul 15 23:10:31 2015 UTC,Dorsett has to perform first though it could be a worse case scenario move  I'd be surprised if TY goes
Colts,3dfa2d,rounder55,11,Thu Jul 16 00:39:44 2015 UTC,"If he insists on Bryant and DT money I don't see anyway the Colts sign him. That kind of contract won't be compatable with Luck's eventual contract. Also, I love T.Y. but he is not worth that kind of cash."
Colts,3dfa2d,CanlStillBeGarth,3,Thu Jul 16 00:50:19 2015 UTC,I don't see him making that much  It'd be interesting to see how long the guaranteed money kicks in...I haven't seen the details  He's a tier below those guys
Colts,3dfa2d,rounder55,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Dorsett and Moncrief are at least eventual starters, so they won't be forced to pay Hilton too much."
Colts,3dfa2d,JaquiskiTaterTartt,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:52 2015 UTC,I feel like the whole Reggie getting the boot and then the Dorsett signing has really bothered TY. His mentor is gone and his possible replacement signed a 1st round contract. Meanwhile he's making chump change. I mean he's making less that Donald Thomas for crying out loud. Granted he may not have Dez' height or catch radius but he at least is due a raise. Is it his fault management waited to re-sign our entire offense at the same time? It'd be great if he took Cobb money but I feel like he's definitely going to look out for himself on this one.
Colts,3dfa2d,Davaldo,5,Thu Jul 16 04:23:36 2015 UTC,"I love TY so don't take this post the wrong way. He is not on the same level as Dez or DT. He deserves Cobb money and nothing more. He shouldn't be mad that Reggie is gone. His best years are obviously gone and he was holding us back in a sense toward the end of the year and his body just isn't holding up. He can be pissed about the Dorsett signing all he wants, but they are just putting more weapons around Luck. It's not like Andre will be here long anyway.  As for the part about the FO waiting to sign everyone at the same time.... They were all drafted at the same time. Did you expect them to give up a whole year of cheap contracts to change that? If we started giving extensions already that would have messed with what we were wanting to do in FA this past spring. It's a Super Bowl run man.  Bottom line is TY can sign for Cobb money or move on. He isn't Dez Bryant. He never will be Dez Bryant, and he will never put up 16 TDs in a season. Simple as that. We can't ruin our chances at a solid roster by handing out a mega deal to a 5'9"" receiver, no matter how productive he is to this point.   Even if he decides our offer isn't enough and he hits FA I just don't see someone offering him insane money like that."
Colts,3dfa2d,bburchibanez,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:26:06 2015 UTC,"No I agree with basically everything you are saying but I'm worried about where he is mentally. He makes the Pro Bowl, outperforms his rookie contract three years straight and is seen as our number 1 receiver. I feel like he looks at guys around the league that are getting paid meanwhile he's producing but hasn't even had contract negotiations. I added the part about Reggie bc he absolutely idolized him and I'm sure it was a big blow to him.  Every tweet after Reggie was basically saying how he was in shock and I'm sure training camp without him in the locker room is weird. It would be amazing if he took Cobb money but he is definitely due some type of pay day. You know his agent is probably in his ear too telling him he should be making #1 receiver money. At this point too, we haven't even seen Dorsett play either. For all we know (knocks on wood) he could be Tavon Austin. Tons of speed/agility but never really produces.  From a business perspective yes it makes sense for TY to get MAX 11 million but from his perspective he's been making less than depth lineman. I do wish they gave Castonzo a deal this year rather than wait to at least get his out of the way."
Colts,3dfa2d,Davaldo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:58:57 2015 UTC,"It seems to me like TY knows he's not going to get Dez/DT money.  I think the ""bar is set"" comment is more aimed at the production those guys have accumulated to be offered said contracts.  Honestly, if he has a damn good year and proves he can be the ""go to"" receiver on big downs, I'll expect him to get about $10m a year.  That's really the only thing that separates Dez and DT from him.  He hasn't proven he can consistently beat extra attention on big moments."

It's hard to argue that TY is AS important to the Colts as Dez is to Dallas or DT is to the Broncos, at least at this point. He lacks a big, physical body and height. But he's worth a contract for 5 years at $10-12 mil a year, with maybe $20 mil guaranteed."
Colts,3dfa2d,Aleph_Alpha_001,4,Thu Jul 16 07:58:44 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this speculation that we won't pay for T.Y.  He's our Colts veteran now, mentored by Reggie Wayne.  Last season, even if he didn't have the absolute best of his career, he was also opposite of a regularly injured Reggie.  This season, he'll be opposite of an incredibly amped and talented Andre Johnson, with a run game called Frank Gore.  TY is going to absolutely blow up this year."

Hopefully, we can keep them both, but I would prefer a healthy Allen to a healthy Fleener.

Colts,3dfa2d,Dramaticnoise,4,Wed Jul 15 21:30:20 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what he asks. At 11M$/year maximum, I'll keep him. If he want more, as sad as it will be, we'll have to let him walk. :("

If he goes off this year and him and Luck still have that deep connection even with all these other weapons we have signed, I say give him what he wants.

Colts,3d9o0q,SpiritDuplicator,12,Tue Jul 14 16:16:00 2015 UTC,"This is fantastic news, he's absolutely deserving of the honor. I remember meeting him shortly after our Super Bowl win - he's the perfect gentleman, the embodiment of Colts football. I hope he finds his way into the Pro Football Hall of Fame one day.  I'd been considering which Colts games to attend. Looks like I'll have to rustle up some tickets for this one."
Colts,3d9o0q,McSprad,7,Tue Jul 14 16:39:05 2015 UTC,"Good addition...he was key to so many things we did on the line and I'll never forget that recovered fumble in the AFCC. But I guess Tarrik Glenn is never gonna make it, which bums me out."
Colts,3d9o0q,Victory33,7,Tue Jul 14 16:51:14 2015 UTC,"Fun note on Tarik Glenn--I once read that he was so in tune with Peyton's silent snap count that he would erroneously get called for false starts because his reaction time was too fast for referees to reconcile with the snap. After games, the Colts would send video to the NFL main office for review, and the league often acknowledged that the refs' calls were incorrect. Great player, and a huge loss when he retired after the Super Bowl.  Here is the article--a great read on the development of the silent count. http://www.si.com/vault/2013/09/02/106363505/the-silent-treatment"
Colts,3d9o0q,Victory33,6,Tue Jul 14 16:58:56 2015 UTC,"Never knew that...but it explains the Tarik ""False Start"" Glenn nickname and gives him a valid excuse. Our line was never the same after he left."
Colts,3d9o0q,Aleph_Alpha_001,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:00:32 2015 UTC,"I think that Castanzo could eventually become as good as Glenn. His pass blocking is on par, and his run blocking is improving. It's the only thing Chris Polian got right.  Edit: Scratch that. I confused him with Ugoh. CP got nothing right."
Colts,3d9o0q,McSprad,3,Sun Jul 19 07:33:27 2015 UTC,"But I guess Tarrik Glenn is never gonna make it, which bums me out.   I agree, but I understand why they wouldn't want to induct him. We really needed him for our offensive line, but he took his Super Bowl ring and called it quits. He apparently didn't want to play football anymore, which is a fine reason to retire, but it put us in a really rough spot and the difficulty of that situation may disqualify him from the Ring of Honor.  His decision also induced us to make that idiotic trade-up for Tony Ugoh in the 2007 NFL Draft. Not only did his retirement cost us our best offensive tackle of the 2000s, it also ate up 1st, 2nd and 4th-round draft picks. Not a good way to go."
Colts,3d9o0q,Victory33,6,Tue Jul 14 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he did play 10 years in the league and all for the Colts and started all 16 games in all but one season. That ain't easy for a lineman. I don't think his retirement should be held against him...I think it's his lack of ""notoriety"" that is hurting him. He wasn't a name or face like Saturday or our play makers."
Colts,3d9o0q,McSprad,3,Tue Jul 14 17:07:53 2015 UTC,"I definitely believe he ought to be in the Ring of Honor. He was durable and consistent, and at his best was one of the best tackles around.  You may be right about the notoriety factor. Most Colts fans who care at all know Tarik was a spectacular lineman, one of the better ones we've had in franchise history. But his name doesn't mean nearly as much as Jeff's, in part because his retirement cut his career short just as he was starting to get Pro Bowl recognition.   It's a real shame."
Colts,3d9o0q,keenynman343,7,Tue Jul 14 17:11:56 2015 UTC,He was such a hard working player. He definitely deserves it.

Saturday is a legend, once all the guys from the Peyton years retired it's going to be rapid fire additions for a while."

Colts,3d9ry0,waynewideopenTD,6,Tue Jul 14 16:43:24 2015 UTC,Buy. This offense can carry team into Super Bowl.
Colts,3d9ry0,justgip,5,Tue Jul 14 18:01:28 2015 UTC,"I really like the analysis here. I think it just really hit me for the first time what losing Redding will do to that DL, damn we're in trouble there. I also might be overly optimistic in Irving's recovery, but we could definitely have a solid little group of ILBs (or at least compared to recent years). I might have given them a Buy. My biggest debate is with the running backs. It's hard to put anything other than Buy on it, considering how last year was with Trent and a nervous Boom Herron. But it is also difficult to be optimistic when the offensive line has so many question marks. Overall I'm inclined to agree with you though, In Gore We Trust."
Colts,3d9ry0,HanaHonu,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"Glad you enjoyed it!  If Langford, Jones, or any of the young guys (Chapman, Kerr, Anderson, Parry) can step up on DL, it'd really help. Kerr did alright last year and Jones has talent if he stays healthy. I'll definitely miss Redding though :(   As for RB, it's impossible to evaluate a team in a vacuum; like you say, how the backs do depends on the offensive line. But purely from a ""this player is gone, this player is here now"" perspective, I think Gore is enough of an upgrade over Trent and 8 games worth of Ahmad Bradshaw to go with Buy, at least for now."
Colts,3d9ry0,ae_syn89,3,Tue Jul 14 18:30:13 2015 UTC,"Nice write up but Castonzo isn't in his 4th year bruh. He's going into his 5th year.  QB: Buy. Obvious reasons.  RB: Hold. Gained Gore but lost Bradshaw. This has the potential to be a ""buy"" but since Gore is old I'm not quite willing to buy in fully yet.   WR: Buy. Obvious reasons.  TE: Hold. No additions or losses. Two questions make this a hold. Can Allen stay healthy and can Fleener become more consistent?  OL: Hold. Again this is a wait and see group.   DL: Sell. Agree with OPs analysis.  OLB: Buy. We'll have some semblance of a pass rush.  ILB: Hold. This could go buy or sell by end of the season. I'll hold for now.  DB: Buy. Agree with OP.  K: Sell. I love Vinny but I think he'll start losing power this year more than ever. Time to start looking for another kicker to replace him when he retires.  P: Buy!!!! All hail the Boomstick!"

Colts,3d6d61,cracka_azz_cracka,3,Wed Jul 15 20:22:30 2015 UTC,yes I do. He changed the entire defense. Watch what he did to Larry Johnson in that first playoff game. Hilarious. Everyone thought he'd have 200 yards against us.
Colts,3d6d61,vivalapants,3,Tue Jul 14 01:12:43 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a horrible defensive unit, lets be honest here. It was barely below average, but getting Sanders back completely transformed the defense, he was that fucking good."
Colts,3d6d61,Citizen_Snip,2,Tue Jul 14 03:10:44 2015 UTC,"Barely below average? The #32 run defense in the league? Look up the stats from the 2nd JAX game that year.    After getting knocked out by the Steelers the year before with what was arguably the best Colt team of the Manning era,  and watching teams run roughshod on the D in the 06 regular season (to the point I was going after FA running backs playing against the Colts in my fantasy league... which worked... And I've never played fantasy football since) and going up against Johnson in the KC game,  I was SHOCKED at the defensive switch.  That playoff run was a huge,  incredibly wonderful surprise."
Colts,3d6d61,DaveSenior72,2,Tue Jul 14 03:59:44 2015 UTC,"Did you watch them that season?  Bobby came back and was the hammer for that defense, it was incredible what he did."
Colts,3d6d61,pokerdot,3,Tue Jul 14 00:22:06 2015 UTC,Rushing yards allowed went from 170/game to 80.
Colts,3d6d61,Big_Baby_Jesus_,-4,Tue Jul 14 00:15:24 2015 UTC,"Small sample size.  We also didn't go up against ANY great RB's in the playoffs. Thomas Fucking Jones ran for 112 yards against us in the SB (career avg 59)  Other running backs faced in the playoffs:   Jamal Lewis (BAL) Corey Dillon / Laurence Maroney (NE) Larry Johnson (KC)   Did well in stopping Larry Johnson, but he only had 13 carries (averaged DOUBLE that on the season) since we dominated that game."
Colts,3d6d61,ajsmitty,3,Tue Jul 14 00:36:19 2015 UTC,"Larry Johnson was the #2 RB in the league with 1789 yards, 26 behind Tomlinson.  He was definitely great that year.  The reason he only had 13 carries is because he was ineffective, averaging 2.5 yards per carry, down from 4.3 for the season.  Jamal Lewis was 8th in the league, which is pretty damned good.  Thomas Jones ran for 60 yards on 14 carries- and had 52 yards on one other carry.    Considering that the Colts rushing D was among the worst in league history, the turnaround in the playoffs when Bob Sanders came back was astonishing."

Colts,3d6d61,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:43:52 2015 UTC,Then how do you explain the defensive turnaround in the playoffs?
Colts,3d6d61,ereller,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"You're definitely not wrong. The Colts can take on 90% of the teams in the NFL because their offense can outscore the opposing team's offense, even against the Colts defense. While strong offenses can tear the Colts up, the offense can usually keep the Colts in the game to have a chance. The problem, however, is when they play teams with a good head coach and/or a good defense. Baltimore, New England, and Seattle are probably the three biggest teams the Colts would have trouble against. I don't doubt that all three of those teams could figure out a way to stop the Colts offense from scoring. Assuming they could get any sort of offense going against us (and, at least in NE's case, that wouldn't be an issue), it would be a long time.   No...the Colts don't have a Super Bowl level defense. They probably have the potential to be good enough, but they certainly can't be making mistakes when we play the strong teams. We need to be able to provide consistent pressure without forcing the blitz. Proving from last year, that's a big problem, and I'm not sure the additions (with Mathis returning) will be enough."
Colts,3d6d61,EarthboundCory,2,Tue Jul 14 03:34:45 2015 UTC,"Of the 3 teams you mention,  New England is the only one the Colts haven't beaten in the last two seasons.   The Pittsburgh game was the most frustrating one to me last year.  There aren't too many times 30+ won't be enough to win."
Colts,3d6d61,DaveSenior72,2,Tue Jul 14 04:03:24 2015 UTC,"I contribute the Pittsburgh game to more about Big Ben being unstoppable in those two weeks than I do overall.  And yes, we have beaten Seattle and Baltimore, but they were both close. Regardless, I'd like our chances against them more than NE."

Colts,3d6d61,Aleph_Alpha_001,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:48:27 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't matter if we had a great defense if we played the Pats, Bill Belichick would have it figured out. Even the game we beat the Pats in the playoffs they scored 35 points on our stout post season defense and we barely held on at home. He has just owned us and our coaches."
Colts,3d6d61,Victory33,2,Tue Jul 14 11:57:01 2015 UTC,"We didn't have an excuse last year not to score more than 7. Our line was blocking well, TY, Allen, Fleener, Nicks were all healthy and believe it or not Boom had more YPC than Blount did....no one wants to say it, but Luck and Pagano kinda shit the bed. This team just goes into panic mode too quick against the Pats and abandons the run game and throws every down. This kills us in the long run as it stops the clock on incompletions (we had 21 of them) and gives the Pats more time to do their thing and score more to get the game out of reach. I really hope we use Gore effectively and keep the ball out of the opposing QBs hands and make this offense less predictable and the defense does it's part and stops the damn run game. I still think we have many holes we think we have fixed but I'm just not so sure. We just have to pray we don't play the Pats again, they exploit our weaknesses like no other team can. No other elite team has beaten us like the Pats, as consistently as they have."

That is kind of my point, the game plan should not be to throw every down in the rain, good coaches adjust based on weather and opponents strengths...the Pats was their secondary. Let's get generous and say we had four drops in the game...Luck still isn't completing 50% of his passes at 12(+4)/33. And 50% is a pretty bad number to begin with."

Colts,3d6d61,SenorPuff,2,Mon Jul 20 12:16:49 2015 UTC,"Less blame on Luck and more on the receivers not getting open against the Pats. Reg was a ghost of himself, Hilton doubled all game (and not healthy), Fleener is painfully inconsistent, and Allen wasn't the same after the ankle injury.  Pagano did a good job with an iffy defensive roster last season, but he's always going to be out coached by Belichick."

Colts,3co566,CornyHoosier,7,Thu Jul 9 14:57:25 2015 UTC,I would guess Power based on avg distance and Placement based on downs inside 20 vs touchbacks. Kinda bullshit since you wont be trying to punt 70 yards if you're at the 50.

Colts,3cmb8r,vivalapants,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:31:35 2015 UTC,"Rodgers averages about 8 INTs per season.  He threw 5 last year.  If Aaron Rodgers played 3 more seasons, threw 8 INTs each year, and threw NO touchdowns, he would still have the best TD/INT ratio ever.    Manning leads a big pack, and then Brady is impressively out in front.  Then Aaron Rodgers is just in a class entirely by himself.    http://www.footballdb.com/leaders/career-passing-tdintratio"
Colts,3cmb8r,Big_Baby_Jesus_,5,Thu Jul 9 03:51:07 2015 UTC,"I've seen the data, my point was Manning just threw 55 TDs 2 seasons ago. Rodgers is going through his prime when we're at an unprecedented number of TDs being thrown. His int rate is crazy however I'm not going to call him the greatest ever because of that 1 stat. I'm not saying he couldnt be in the conversation, just that I'll let their careers talk when we're finished. He could very well have longevity issues."
Colts,3cmb8r,vivalapants,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:52:54 2015 UTC,"I think the class all by himself is important to consider too, he's the first elite QB in the new era of pass-instead-of-run football.  We don't know what elite numbers in this new world look like quite yet to really give context to Rodgers' greatness.  If it takes another ten years for the seasonal records to be held for more than a season or two as the NFL recalibrates itself, we all may have long forgotten about this current streak of Rodgers' or it may be insanely more impressive.  Interesting to find out."
Colts,3cmb8r,oorza,3,Thu Jul 9 15:38:11 2015 UTC,I think /u/vivalapants is just pointing out there's a tremendous difference in Manning/Brady INTs to Rodgers. Rodgers plays in the most QB friendly era that has ever existed while both Manning and Brady had their learning years at a time where defenses were allowed to be much more physical.
Colts,3cmb8r,ABearWithABeer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:39:34 2015 UTC,"Yep. Thats kind of what I meant, he's had his entire career in this crazy pass happy league. It took Peyton 98-04 to break 40 Tds. Lucks already done it in 3. And no offense to Andrew but he's not 04 Peyton. Yet."
Colts,3cmb8r,vivalapants,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:16:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying this makes a huge difference, but Rodgers didn't play his first three years. And the team he was on was solid. Manning got thrown into a shit show as a rookie and was expected to be the second coming. He threw 28 picks his first year. Rodgers had 3 years of just learning that system and practicing before he took the field as a starter. He got to adjust to NFL speed at practice, not in games. For 3 years.  I'm not saying  manning is higher because of that, but people seem to really underestimate the effect that sitting at QB2 can have on a player. You never know how Rodgers would of been as a rookie in this league. His ratio would probably be a little different in my opinion. It also helps that he throws the ball so fast, no one can see it haha"

But, Watt was the pound for pound best player because oh his own personal ability as a football player."
Colts,3cmb8r,WillTrollForKarma,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:10:11 2015 UTC,"So while I agree with Luck's ranking, can I bring Peyton into this (because as a Colt's fan, Peyton will always be a Colt in my eyes). People say he's on the downswing and that he's not good anymore but compared to Aaron Rodgers, the anointed best QB in the NFL (I disagree), Peyton actually had a better year last year. Here are the stats:   Roders '14 - 4382 yds 38 TD 65.6% compl Manning '14 - 4727 yds 39 TD 66.2% compl  Keep in mind that Peyton played injured after about week 10 and played with a torn muscle in his leg for last 4 games or so. How can anyone make a strong case for Rodgers being significantly better, or ever marginally better than Peyton? (Rodgers did only throw for 5 INT's while Peyton threw for 24, 4 of which came in one game and Peyton seems to have one game every year where he throws 4 INT's but other than that, Peyton bests Rodgers in every meaningful category)"
Colts,3cmb8r,reverendgeneral,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:48:11 2015 UTC,Huge efficiency and mobility differences. Plus the makers of the list were probably wary of Manning being/turning 39 and being injured at the end of last season.

I say that because he knows he has a lot to learn, and even though he was speaking to an audience of people many years his junior, his actions on and off the field represent who he is as a role model; a role model is by definition, ""a person looked to by others as an example to be imitated.""  From what we see and hear him do from the way he treats opponents on the field, his leadership of the team, his ""aw shucks"" demeanor that emanates a down-to-Earth man, personal accountability (we all know I could go on for days about this guy), then there's no question that he's a fantastic example of someone who should be imitated.  TL;DR: Andrew Luck doesn't say it, he displays it.  Edit: Wording"

Colts,3ckz4h,seemoreglass83,11,Thu Jul 9 02:50:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like the guys at BR are assigned a story, they look at stats on PFF,  then create a slideshow of their findings. I commented recently on an article that rated D'Qwell as poor against the run. The guy stinks in coverage and about his only strong suit was tackling RBs. I don't know where they get there info sometimes but it just seems like they see ""oh he only missed 3 tackles all season gotta be the best safety in the league IF NOT ALL TIME"". No, he missed four games due to roids and could barely beat out Serg to get his job back two games after his suspension ended. If he missed three tackles in 8 games that's pretty shit. Not to mention the ones he blew by being in the wrong spot."
Colts,3ckz4h,Davaldo,2,Wed Jul 8 20:10:57 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, I read the DQ ratings and thought the guy had him completely flipped. They rated him high/decent in pass coverage and low in run coverage."

They are not taking into account the times that he took terrible angles or was too slow and thus wasn't even there to make the play he should have.

Colts,3cfrhc,SpiritDuplicator,5,Tue Jul 7 16:04:56 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of what makes Pep's offense effective has been its flexibility--passing out of heavy (2+ TE) sets, etc.  And I think a 3-down running back who is in the game almost all the time could add another layer of flexibility on top of that. They may be rare, but a real lead-dog runner could push this offense over the edge imo."
Colts,3cfrhc,amadeus119,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:59:41 2015 UTC,2 TE sets with a 3 down back would be great.  Wouldn't give any hint to the defense in terms of run/pass.  Really hoping Gore has enough in the tank for a year or two of that until we can find a suitable replacement.
Colts,3cfrhc,swampking,10,Tue Jul 7 20:08:43 2015 UTC,"yes, Frank Gore is immortal"
Colts,3cfrhc,znk916,6,Tue Jul 7 21:26:28 2015 UTC,"Boom - nope  Ballard - nearing his shelf life already  Robinson - shows promise, but he's yet to play a snap. Too early to tell how long he'll be around."
Colts,3cfrhc,ae_syn89,3,Tue Jul 7 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"If Ballard can recover, I'd like to see the 2nd coming of Addai/Rhodes + superbowl with Robinson/Ballard."
Colts,3cfrhc,Simpleton216,3,Tue Jul 7 23:50:49 2015 UTC,It won't be Boom or Ballard. I think Josh Robinson can be serviceable for a while.
Colts,3cfrhc,csreid,2,Tue Jul 7 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you mean by longterm RB. The shelf life of a RB is 3 years, and even Robinson who just entered the league may only be around for 3-6 years depending on circumstances. The best solution to RB is the method of just cycling through RBs every 3 years and doing good scouting for draft prospects instead of getting caught up in trying to find a huge star."
Colts,3cfrhc,cavall1215,2,Tue Jul 7 16:34:00 2015 UTC,"I think the days of Edge style RBs has passed.  I don't think we have a ""lifer"" on our team.  I think the days of backs lasting long careers is gone.  The speed of the game puts too much wear and tear on them."
Colts,3cfrhc,MalenkoMC,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"the days of Edge style RBs has passed   That is, unless we grab Ezekiel Elliott out of the draft next year. The guy is a ""lifer"" and does a great job of avoiding big hits."
Colts,3cfrhc,MReprogle,2,Thu Jul 9 16:19:27 2015 UTC,"In college... :)  NFL is a completely different monster.  But if he is the ""lifer"" you say he is, I doubt he will be available at the 32nd pick in the first round. ;)"
Colts,3cfrhc,MalenkoMC,2,Thu Jul 9 17:28:33 2015 UTC,"He might be there a little later due to being a RB, but we still might have to trade up from the 32nd"
Colts,3cfrhc,MReprogle,2,Fri Jul 10 01:43:30 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of discounting Ballard but I'm not going to do that. He has only played in 17 games since 2012 due to injury. If he can get those injuries squared away, he has fresh enough legs to still be a good long term option. He's in the same mold as Frank Gore so hopefully he'll learn a lot from him being in Indy. But, if he doesn't have any more bad luck, I still see him not only around, but doing what the Colts need him to do in the next 5-6 years."
Colts,3cfrhc,aidub5,2,Tue Jul 7 18:07:30 2015 UTC,"I hope josh Robinson pans out. I like his spirit and I love the way he runs the ball. If he cracked 1000 every year, that'd be huge. We haven't had one of those since Addai."
Colts,3cfrhc,nerdjam45,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"I really like josh Robinson. His college ball speaks for itself. He's a little big man. I really hope he can be a guy who consistently gets about 4ypc. He won't be a home run kind of guy, but I hope he can move the chains at least."
Colts,3cfrhc,MynameisDouglas,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:20:31 2015 UTC,I like Ballard and J-Robs.
Colts,3cfrhc,ClipClopMotherLucker,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:09:42 2015 UTC,"Boom needs to show serious improvement. He's a solid back, but in the regular season he had terrible ball security (something he improved upon in the post season though).  Tipton... no.  Ballard I don't even expect to last an entire season, let alone 4-5 years.  Robinson who the hell knows. Gotta see how he does, doubt he will get much playing time though unless he really impresses in camp."
Colts,3cfrhc,Citizen_Snip,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:40:28 2015 UTC,Nope. That long term RB is hopefully gonna be Ezekiel Elliott from next year's draft class.
Colts,3cfrhc,MReprogle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:17:23 2015 UTC,"Hell no. But knowing Grigson, we are still two years away from picking one that is."
Colts,3cfrhc,Bleedcoltsblue,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:16:14 2015 UTC,"I'm excited to see what Robinson can do. He gets to learn from Gore, which should help him tremendously. Remember in 2012 our running game was supposed to be putrid, and while Donald never impressed, Ballard came out of nowhere and iced a few games down the stretch.  Then last season our third and fourth string RBs contributed when we needed them to. If we keep finding guys in late rounds that fit the system and can produce when called upon, I'm more than happy forgoing a heavy investment at the position."
Colts,3cfrhc,waynewideopenTD,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:15:11 2015 UTC,Robinson's the only one who has a chance to be.
Colts,3cdhll,therilech242,8,Tue Jul 7 01:41:30 2015 UTC,"Guys, for the record this list is just for the 2014 season. It doesn't take into account other seasons."
Colts,3cdhll,slash196,0,Tue Jul 7 03:51:02 2015 UTC,I'd put him 4th. I think he benefited from a pretty soft secondary everywhere else on the field. Teams could afford to avoid him.
Colts,3cdhll,Evil__Jon,4,Tue Jul 7 08:09:48 2015 UTC,Or just run the ball.
Colts,3cdhll,boldspud,3,Tue Jul 7 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"He was one of the most targeted of the rest of the top 5. People didn't avoid him, and he still had equivalent or better stats than some of those other guys."
Colts,3cdhll,Pway,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:34:12 2015 UTC,? People avoided the other top corners more often so not sure I see your logic.
Colts,3cdhll,Mind_Killer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:49:21 2015 UTC,I want to see him put together more seasons like last year. The reason guys like Revis are always listed high is because they do their jobs consistently.   Davis had an outstanding year. But it was just one year. Let's see what else he's got.
Colts,3cdhll,SpiritDuplicator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:45:47 2015 UTC,"""Top 101 Cornerbacks""? Seriously? This is too much. You could rank every team's top 3 corners....and you'd have to keep going. But hey, I guess even St. Louis's dimeback needs some love."
Colts,3cdhll,Ferg8,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:32:01 2015 UTC,Next? Top101 QBs in the NFL!
Colts,3cdhll,SpiritDuplicator,2,Tue Jul 7 19:00:55 2015 UTC,Number 47 will SHOCK you
Colts,3cdhll,allwhiteboy69,0,Tue Jul 7 19:55:58 2015 UTC,"I would say thats a bit high. Hes definitely top 5, but I don't think he is second to only Sherman. he just hasn't played at this high of a level for very long. If he continues his outstanding play this season and into the future, then I would agree"
Colts,3cdhll,boldspud,13,Tue Jul 7 02:15:46 2015 UTC,I gathered that it was specifically ranking 2014 performances?
Colts,3cdhll,repeat-,3,Tue Jul 7 02:22:07 2015 UTC,That is correct.
Colts,3cdhll,PM_ME_LUCKPICS,6,Tue Jul 7 03:11:27 2015 UTC,You think Peterson had a better season than Davis???
Colts,3cdhll,you_know_how_I_know,3,Tue Jul 7 03:37:59 2015 UTC,"Ah. I feel dumb, the article is just of 2014. I meant overall"
