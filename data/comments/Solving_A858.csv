Think of it like converting a number from decimal to binary. 5 in decimal becomes 101 in binary. Just because its outward appearance is different, doesn't mean that it isn't still the same value.  So we could do about as much with it in this form as we could in its original hex form."
Solving_A858,3e4pnj,Zlag_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"Text on the internet is encoded in different formats such as ASCII. An encoding maps numbers to corresponding characters. Why hexadecimal is used is because cryptographic functions create random characters that are sometimes not printable characters or carriage returns, ect. Hexadecimal uses numbers and letters to turn each number 0-255 into a two letter representation. What you did is turned the hex into its number equivalent, which isn't useful because it is still encrypted and we don't know what encoding is being used."

Looking back when I did have time, it was, ""chaos"" and what not.   I totally agree that no decryption attempt should go undocumented. I had posted everything I had here previously (which ended up in a pissing war).   If anything organization is important but to be fair most don't have time to follow a ""common"" template. It is also inefficient sadly (at least for me...) filling out a template derails my productivity and interrupts my train of thought. It is also important to remember that A858 doesn't (at least IMHO) any particular template. Following standards ins't going to solve this (but it may solve some here and there by chance).   If it was cut and dry, (from my perspective) this would have been boring because it would have been something like, ""Oh look a rot13 data set"" yay...  That's at least how I think of it. Standards are boring. This is far from standard and completely not boring. IMO, we should be thinking out of the box.   We should of course convert using standards to the various base(s) to see what happens like we all do, but adhering to encryption/decryption standards I don't think is the right way to approach A858's posts.   Some of the more technical folks can look at a data set after doing a base conversion and ""know"" (I use that term extremely lightly) that it ""looks"" like something familiar whether it's a pattern or duplicate lines or shifting rot-n style etc.   I have found that approaching things that are unknown (especially for this long) that going with ""what could this be"" and trying a series of ""where will this data set lead me after I convert it to ""x"""" is a better approach.   You never know what type of data it is. AutoAnalysis is a great tool but it can't think out of the box. It can't think for itself or make assumptions based off the values it's pulling. This is why it's so interesting. We don't know what it is, it could be .pcap files which I got some interesting results from.

A lot may seem stupid (the one I made that got downvoted to oblivion included), but you have to keep your mind open - a change in perspective, a new idea, that's what gets people rolling. Not what the numbers are, we know that much, but what the numbers look like. Dismissing hypotheses is called poisoned thinking - you're stuck on a thought trail and it keeps you in the same box.

They're noise from people who don't know what they're talking about and the OP is perfectly correct to call them amateurs. I don't mean any offence to anyone by that, I'm just stating a fact.  This nature of this subreddit means that it is vulnerable to the Dunning-Kruger effect. Anyone, while standing in the shower one morning, can come up with a hypothesis about A858 posts might be. Most of these ideas can be trivially discounted from what we already know about the posts - particularly the fact that they're statistically random. But if you don't have a basic knowledge of cryptography, that isn't obvious. It's annoying to those of us who do have some knowledge of crypto, because we can see that it's a waste of time.  In almost all cases the answer to these hypotheses is ""probably not, do you have any actual reason to think that?"", and the answer is inevitably ""no"". Rule 5 is an attempt to set a deliberate barrier to entry: you have to be able to answer that question with ""yes"" before you can proceed.

Solving_A858,3buuiz,Gabemarques1,14,Thu Jul 2 09:48:49 2015 UTC,"Why do a lot of people here assume that these trailing 64 bit block is a key? It doesn´t make sense at all. If we assume some form of a symmetric encryption the security of such a scheme solely relies on key knowledge. You wouldn´t send money in a safe and stick the key at the bottom, wouldn´t you? The same is true here: If you encrypt some information using algorithm XYZ you won´t send the key along with that encrypted information. If anybody finds the correct Algorithm XYZ all your confidentiality is gone and you could have send in clear, that wouldn´t make a difference. But if you read through the specification of common encryption algorithms most require something that is call an ""initialization vector (IV)"". This is because if you encrypt the SAME information under the SAME secret key the encrypted message will also be the SAME. So this IV is used to ""salt""/""seed"" the algorithm. So instead of using encrypt(message, key) you use something like encrypt(message, key, IV). As said above: ""key"" has to be kept secret among the participating parties, but IV HAS to be made public (i.e. sent with the encrypted message) so the the receiver can use decrypt(encrypt(message, key, IV), key, IV) = message to finally get back the original data. Each time you initialize the encyption algothim you use a different/random IV, therefore encrypting the SAME message with the same key will result in a completely different output! So IMHO: if at all this 64 bit block is some IV, but never a key.  The same considerations are in principle true for other ""theories"" where keying material is derived from previous or future posts. Again that doesn´t make sense from a cryptographers point of view, at least as long as we are talking about symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption always relies on the symmetric (=shared) key to be kept secret. But what about asymmetric encryption? It´s not very probable that an asymmetric encryption is used here, because it´s slow, awfully slow compared to symmetric encryption. While symmetric algorithms typically use keys of 64/128/192 bit in length all known asymmetric algorithms rely on some mathematical problem that is hard to break for LARGE numbers. RSA e.g. relies on the fact that a big number (today: 1024 bit and above) is very hard to factorize. The trade-off is that you have to deal with these big numbers whenever you encrypt or decrypt something, and handling such numbers is very CPU intense. So in practice you use an asymmetric encryption only to exchange some short messages (e.g. a key for a symmetric algorithm) and switch to a fast symmetric algorithm after that to exchange the ""real data"".  And a last remark: How can you be sure - even if you would have found the correct algorithm XYZ AND the correct key AND the block cipher mode of operation - that decrypting the posts will reveal any other than just ""random crap"". All of you seem to expect some form of ultra secret wow message ... I claim the opposite is true! If we take the first posts as unencrypted most of them seem to contain something that looks like .NET GUIDs. Did you read about those? These are despite two bytes ... completely random! From my perspective the content of the encrypted message (or at least we assume they are encrypted) did not change. Why should it have changed if this reddit channel is still used with the same purpose as before? The only difference is that before encryption there were random GUIDs ... and after A858 introduced encryption the random GUIDs are now encrypted. decrypting them will result in ... ""random crap"", just these random GUIDs. The only hint (maybe we could call it ""known plaintext attack""?) is that - if we take my theory as valid - a successful decryption MUST result in that format of these GUIDs, i.e. https://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/wiki/early_posts the 7th byte must be decrypted to ""04"" and the 9th byte to ""10xx"" for ALL the 128 bit blocks. But for me at the moment that would be the only hint that a correct decryption was found!"

Solving_A858,3buuiz,SniffMaster,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:34:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree ;)  If we stick to the idea of (.NET) GUIDs, and there are some indications in the early posts, that indeed these 128 bit blocks at least follow that scheme: The format itself it not necessarily bound to a .NET GUIDs, it can be used in a more common sense as so called UUIDs which have the same (random) structure. And there is a protocol that uses them: the well know DCE/RPC, see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Computing_Environment  Assume you have such a distributed environment all around the world (you may call it ""bot"" network, but it may not necessarily be evil). How can you control communication among these network nodes that do not know each other? Well, set up a control instance. That control instance runs a service where each network node registers with it´s current IP address plus network port it listens on. This registration results in such a UUID. If other nodes want to talk with that first system, they may ask this controlling instance and provide that UUID. But how do these other nodes know this UUID? One way (of course not the only way) would be to publish it on this reddit channel that is known to all nodes.  So no matter where a node resides, it reads this channel, receives that new UUID of the first example node, may ask the (known) controlling instance, provide the UUID of the first node, receives back as answer the IP address plus port of the first node ... and can start communicating with that first node. In such a way you are able to setup and control a meshed distributed network of nodes.  To be honest: I do not see any hint at all that this is a ""puzzle"" that has some ""cleartext"" solution that somebody wants us to solve. But the reason for this sub to exist is: To C&C (=Command and Control) some distributed environment. And if we assume that you do not have control over your distributed nodes (e.g. when they go online/offline, when they change IPs, etc.) you have to provide data through a public spot with high availablity (e.g. reddit) but not through some form of ""secret database"".  The only purpose in using encryption here is not necessarily security, it´s simply to mask that information that can be derived from the plain text UUIDs. If you assume that these plain text UUIDs are used by some C&C it would be very easy to write blocking rules for firewalls/IPSs using this reddit: just drop/reject any (DCE/RPC) communication that asks for these UUIDs - and your C&C is broken. But if he encrypts the UUIDs you may even know that it´s the same information in principle, but you won´t be able to derive some countermeasure from it without knowing how to decrypt these things.  From my perspective there are more (especially missing!) hints that this is not a puzzle that can be solved to some ""clear text content"" than the other way around. Just my 2 Cent."
Solving_A858,3buuiz,SniffMaster,3,Fri Jul 3 06:17:55 2015 UTC,"Some additional remarks:  ""Now, these algorithms that I tested have a variable key-size, so I was expecting them not to work, since the posts with this pattern have a fixed size key of 64-bits."" That´s not quite correct - both can be used with a variable key size, but if you use them you have to choose one of those key sizes. Twofish (key sizes 128/192/256 bit) doesn´t support 64 bit, but CAST-128 (key size 40 to 128 bit variable in 8 bit increments) would do so. So ""variable key-size"" has no importance as long as the ""desired"" key size can be used.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/wiki/201201060513 This probable hint fits well with my theory: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1851.txt 3DES indeed uses a 64 bit IV ... so you should ask  ""Find a symmetric-key algorithm with a block-size of 128-bits and a key-size IV size of 64-bits.""  ""Try to find obscure algorithms. Since it's a cryptographic puzzle, it's probably made by cryptography entusiasts, and they wouldn't use common algorithms for that."" Well, if they are professionals ... they WILL use a common algorithm, because these are well known, well tested, well analyzed and there are tamper-proof implementations for most common programming languages. IT history has a lot of examples where inventing the wheel again led to disastrous results when so called ""cryptography experts"" or ""cryptography enthusiats"" developed their own encryption scheme, see e.g. one of the latest ones here: https://threatpost.com/weak-homegrown-crypto-dooms-open-smart-grid-protocol/112680"

I'm also thinking of making a post with suggestions to were to look now. I mean, looking back at what I saw in this post, I think there are some interesting questions.  What does the 5th GIF post pointer mean and what does it have to do with block cipher encryption? Should we try to decipher it using those methods?  What does the 32-bit group post mean? I converted some of those to its decimal counterpart, hoping those would be primes, making it another prime post, but nothing there.  What can we discover from the 64 bit posts. There are a lot of those referenced. Are they hashes? A858 doesn't seem to post that much with only 64 bits. Should we try to brute force that? Diff those?  I'm also wondering about all those prime number posts and how they can be used in encryption. It would mean we would have at least a third encryption method, assuming the MD5 and Block Cipher were used previously.  What do the ""zero"" and ""almost zero"" posts mean? If /u/Plorntus is correct and they are puzzles that were edited out, can we get those same puzzles again? But still, what are the ""almost zero"" ones? What do they mean and why do they have the same content between each other?  Before waiting for an A858 comeback, we should try to find these answers because they do seem within our reach."

The auto analysis should always grab the first instance before its edited. However the puzzle posts we have decoded/unusual posts are usually edited to the 64bit posts after, there was also cases where the normal posts have been edited after. The ones you have in the first post are the original versions so its where he's actually posted them first time (and not been edited in).  The reason I believed this to be at the end of a particular sequence is because whenever this occurs its usually after he stops posting for a while. For example look at the 9cb9d subreddits message now its gone private.   This is the primary reason why I stopped attempting to solve the main bulk of it because it just seemed like theres absolutely no way of piecing together this information without being incredibly patient since you dont know what pertains to what and whats actually useful."
Solving_A858,3ai91v,bluelite,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:27:33 2015 UTC,"Oh, thank you for your clarification.  I do think he has been giving us a lot of leads. The PostAnalyzer post indicates that the were two available encryptions. MD5 and another one - although, from what I read in some comments elsewhere, MD5 might be because people were throwing that theory around and he wanted to joke around...  The block cipher has multiple references, so as the prime numbers. I do believe he has been telling us what kind of stuff he was using.  Since he was banned and had to explain what he was doing to the admins, I'm thinking it does have a meaning. At least he taunted us into solving multiple times, with the puzzle posts and the one that isn't on the wiki.  And he keeps giving us these pointless posts like the birthday cake or the PRESSTHEBUTTON one. They just seem an attempt to keep this alive, so I wouldn't be surprised if he wanted us to find out what this is. He seems to be a lurker here, as well, according to his last message.  He does like to troll though, since he did put a bitcoin address on the description of the sub when a lot of people were pushing for the bitcoin theory. And I also read in the comments that the ZIP file with troll.txt was from a time when a lot of people were saying that was just random data and some were saying that it could be byte instructions (that theory doesn't seem to be thrown around as much nowadays).  The GIF one surprises me the most, since I don't seem to be finding a follow up. The diff revealed a standard number for block cipher encryption and then another diff revealed a post. It's almost like he was saying ""hey, block cipher this"".  This one has no follow up as well.  EDIT: I found the comment I read a while back showing that he likes to troll. It's yours!. I knew I had seen that somewhere."
Solving_A858,3ai91v,Existential_Weiner,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:43:07 2015 UTC,"One thing that continually gnaws at me: nearly all of those posts that we decoded contain some ""code"" whose purpose remains unknown. For example, the birthday cake contains ""pxeghopwwlemmchel"", there are the prime number posts, the ""amoung you"" message, and more. As far as I know, the original post gets decoded, but then we all run into a dead end with the message embedded in it."
Solving_A858,3ai91v,Plorntus,2,Sun Jun 21 05:50:33 2015 UTC,"The birthday cake message is still weird to me. But it felt more like he was sending a ping, to keep this thing running. He had to include something besides the cake, so we wouldn't stop. Otherwise it would be ""Oh yea, a cake, that's cute"".  The prime numbers, IMO, are related to encryption methods. For example, RSA Encryption uses the multiplication of two very large prime numbers, which then are factored to encrypt the message. Here is a good practical example. Note that there, the two prime numbers are only small to show as an example. They are supposed to be very large.  If you have access to those prime numbers, you can decode the message.  A858 did gives us an awful lot of prime numbers. I didn't actually think through about this before, but in some of his prime number posts he did give us a list of factors of primes, which would also be pointing to RSA encryption. That would be his third method of encryption and we might have in our hands the prime numbers used to encrypt the messages (making it possible to decrypt). This is but a theory, though.  As for the ""Amoung you"", there is a comment that shows the connection between the first and second puzzle post. I think this is a more plausible interpretation. The ""amoung you"" bit would be him saying ""Bye"". Instead of ""Cheers, a858"" he said ""amoung you"", thus proving that he watches the sub and gives meaning to his messages according to how we are, currently."

Solving_A858,3ae24j,scoutthesprout,4,Fri Jun 19 10:47:00 2015 UTC,"As /u/stefanbogdjr mentioned, there is a page detailing some theories.   ...And incidentally, what would you like it to be?   Have you ever seen the movie Mercury Rising?  The NSA develops a new encryption algorithm and to test it they create a crossword puzzle (if my memory serves). An autistic kid solves the puzzle so naturally someone at NSA sends assassins to silence him. Fortunately Bruce Willis works in the same area so the kid has a fighting chance.  I kind of hope it's something like that- NSA is using reddit to test their secret suite A crypto. But, if I'm being honest, I realize this is unlikely to the point of being impossible.  Another implausible theory is that it's someone testing his homebrew crypto. This is unlikely because encryption relies on the algorithm being public because ""security through obscurity is not security."" No one in academia or industry will consider an encryption method unless they can scrutinize the algorithm. (The one exception to this is NSA's suite A. I don't understand why it's kept secret so I won't comment too much on it.)  Another (more realistic) thought I had is that someone created /r/a858 to learn the reddit api and/or test a bot. When someone noticed it, a858 decided to keep it going because trolling is fun. This is also kinda unlikely because he had no reason to create his own sub instead of using /r/test.  Now for something factual to give this post one redeeming paragraph... a858 was allegedly banned by reddit  at some point. In order to have his ban lifted,  he would have had to explain himself to the admins. I think we can deduce from this that he is not doing anything illegal.  Anyway, welcome to reddit.

Since his name is made of more 64 bits, I tried to run, on md5 decoders (which, I believe, simply run the input through rainbow tables) the combinations of message + a858, a858 + message. And then did the same with 9cb9...  No output, which was expected.  I don't know if anyone else has any ideas that we could try... The message seems a bit off...  EDIT: English  EDIT 2: Tried with fnv164 (since it produces 64 bit digests), no luck decoding it. Tried to encrypt a few words as well, since the websites I used only go through rainbow tables (I can't seem to find one...) and see if it matched the message.

Solving_A858,39x8h4,NeuroTypicalCure,7,Mon Jun 15 15:23:23 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's see if I can help with this.  Please correct me if I am wrong but, in a computer, everything - and I mean everything - is represented by binary digits. Which means that those characters you are watching right now on your screen are, at least internally, numbers in a binary base. They can be represented by ones and zeros.  Now, to show you the text in a way you can understand it, each character is assigned a value (see ASCII table). That value has multiple forms in math: you can see it as a decimal based value (our current 0-9 system), a hexadecimal (instead of counting 0-9, you count 0-f, a total of 16 base values), or binary (base 2, 1s and 0s).  What that means is that when you convert the username from hex to binary is that you are simply taking up the hexadecimal representation and setting it to binary. Then you are converting it to text (remember the ASCII table?). It's just showing you the characters represented by that value. So, no actual data is being taken from those characters, setting it to binary and then to ASCII is no different from converting from hex to ASCII at once. What you did was take up the hex representation and see what text it would match on the ASCII table.  A lot (and I mean a lot) of people already tried that with the username. Once again, his username has nothing to do with ASCII, it comes from a .NET GUID (maybe add this to FAQ in the wiki? Since you do have to check and read that particular post to know the origin of the name and people do tend to try and ""break"" the name first...).  Now, onto why using this with the posts won't work: as one can see in the auto-analysis tool, his posts are random - you can check that by the histogram grid and by stddev being low, which means each character appears about the same number of times. Being random can mean one of two things: he is throwing random data at us and we will never make sense of it, or it is well encrypted data (a perfect cypher would mean that each character appears the same number of times, making it almost impossible to crack). Either way, if we convert those hexadecimal representations to the ASCII equivalent, we would get a bunch of random symbols (according to the ASCII table), each appearing about the same number of times. That doesn't happen in a human-spoken language, like Chinese, English or Icelandic. Languages created by humans have some rules, which means that some words (and consequently, some characters) will appear a greater number of times. By that, we can assume that it is not some sort of human language and using conversions from hex to binary to ASCII or equivalent, will not work. We will simply be displaying a set of seemingly random data in the form of computer characters.  However, some posts, like this one don't have a low stddev, which means the data isn't random (or very well encrypted). Those are the posts we have been able to crack so far. But it isn't always as easy as converting from hex to ASCII or equivalent. Sometimes you have to rotate the grid or use other technics. A full list is available here."

Solving_A858,39ratd,Existential_Weiner,9,Sun Jun 14 00:42:03 2015 UTC,"If you check the auto-analysis tool, you'll see that the standard deviation is very small. It means that each character appears about the same amount of times as any other.  In a human spoken language, there are words and characters that will pop up a lot more than the others (in English, for example, I think the 'e' has the higher number of occurrences in a sentence). A858's ""sentences"" do not have that kind of pattern, they are random. So you can't make sense of what he is doing just by converting hex to ASCII and translating.  Even if you try to make sense of it and say that the ""encryption"" is hex so it may produce results with the same amount of occurrences, that is not true. In a computer, each character is represented by its ASCII code. Being a numerical code it can be represented by binary and hexadecimal. So, even if it was a human language represented in hex, it would have more occurrences of certain words and characters.  Comparing two posts: the most recent as I am typing this and the Max Lerner quote one, you can check the differences. You can also see the differences in the histogram grid.

I'm interested as to where the user or yourself (I don't know who came up with this) decided to use Icelandic because i'e been messing around with google translate and so far: Albanian-translates ""ä Ïá"" as ""Is it"" Basque-translates ""ä Ïá"" as ""A nearly"" Galician-translates ""ä Ïá"" as ""Would"" Maori-translates ""ä Ïá"" as ""And yes"" Welsh-translates ""ä Ïá"" as ""Ice"" this could be a combination of different languages? But again i don't know where to use Icelandic came from, this issue may have already been solved. But this also shows there are 6 different languages that translate these letters into English words we understand, so he might be using different languages for each text, but the one you checked happened to be ""Icelandic"" but the next one might be Welsh(this is just an idea).  the identified time zones of the posts is UTC-3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Timezones2008_UTC-3_gray.png Iceland is UTC.

You can check it by the std dev and the histogram grid in the auto-analysis tool.  I agree that it has a pattern, namely the amount of bytes in the message (which apparently change around every time the timezone changes)  + the last 16 bytes (which can mean a key, one-time pad, etc). But I wouldn't look for a pattern inside each post, probably between posts that are in the same timezone. But even then, you can only see that the number of bits in the message change and the timezone changes as well. Everything else is seemingly random, which indicates a layer of encryption that's not so easily cracked by simply converting it to hex or base64 or something like that.  If anything, I think we should look for the unsolved outliers (the ones with a higher stddev) and try our luck at those."

Solving_A858,39ajhk,hustlebird,11,Wed Jun 10 13:40:20 2015 UTC,"He meant read the wiki about common mental traps. Specifically:   Decoding random data  /u/fragglet wrote about this trap a while back. Here's a quick summary.  There was a popular theory a while back that A858 was posting Z80 assembly code. This refers to the machine instructions used to control a Z80 CPU (a chip popular in home computers in the '80s). For example, in Z80 assembly, a value of ""7A"" represents the instruction ""ld a, d"" (""move the value of the D register into the A register""). Someone found that if you decode A858 posts with a Z80 disassembler, you will get a sequence of Z80 instructions out.  This theory illustrates another common mental trap that it's possible to fall into. In fact, any sequence of bytes will decode to a sequence of Z80 instructions, even if it's completely random data. You will simply have converted random data into random Z80 instructions. The fact that Z80 instructions are produced proves nothing. To actually prove this theory correct you would need to show that the instructions - put together as a full program - actually mean something. But they don't.  Often it's possible to ""decode"" data into some other form. For example you might find a way to decode A858 data into a picture, or a sound, or text. But doing so doesn't prove anything, if the result is a random picture, random noise, or random characters.  A common occurrence of this trap is that people will ""decode"" a post into a sequence of ANSI / Latin-1 characters. Here's an example. The result is just gobbledygook and doesn't prove anything.   So tl;dr - Is this reproducible with meaningful data on other posts? Or is this a random location?"
Solving_A858,39ajhk,nameless912,3,Wed Jun 10 13:50:17 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that we know the data is statistically random, so odds are either it is random or it's encrypted.

Solving_A858,398cgp,Aucser,13,Wed Jun 10 00:02:43 2015 UTC,"I have no intention of being rude here, but I sincerely don't think many of the commenters here understand some base concepts. It's great to see people working towards a goal, but I don't suspect that things are going in a worthwhile direction. While I'm no expert myself, let me do my best to outline some flaws and fundamental concepts that are being overlooked.  1) The 0-9,a-f (or 0-f to be precise) isn't anything special. It's hexadecimal values. Just like our regular number system of 0-9 (called ""Base 10""), Hexadecimal (""Base 16"") is a way to represent numerical values. Same things goes for Binary (0 and 1, or ""Base 2"").   These numerical values can then represent something. Data itself, a shorter form of binary (ex: ""2B"" in Hexadecimal is ""0010 1011"" in binary which is equal to 43 in base 10).  Computers - at the most fundamental level - have two stats: on and off. 1 and 0. Binary. Using Hexadecimal is perhaps the most common way to show this data. When debugging a program in an IDE such as Visual Studio, I have the option to view what data is in the program's memory (section of RAM) and what data in the processor's register/memory. In many cases, the processor's cache view only shows hexadecimal. As a programmer (well, computer science student and budding programmer...), I can utilize this information to determine if it's in line with the data I'm expecting to be in memory or in the processor.   Download a hex editor, such as ollydbg (or even use Notepad++'s hex editor) and open some files in it. A music file, a picture file, a word document, even a (small) zip file. It'll show hexadecimal data that represents that file. Hexadecimal is simply a common way to show data - especially when it comes to computers. That's it. What creates that data is a different thing, which leads me to...  2) MD5 is an encryption algorithm. An encryption algorithm is much like a one way math process. Much like the algebra concept of f(x). In a function, f(x), 'x' can be anything, and 'f' represents what is going to happen to 'x'. An encryption algorithm is like this. It can take in any form of data (a word document, a string of text (such as a file name or password), a picture, a zip archive and so much more) and translate the binary bits into what is called a hash. Because binary bits are being manipulated, hexadecimal comes into effect. It's much easier to store (and analyze, if needed for whatever reason) a string of hexadecimal characters than a novel of 1s and 0s.   MD5 isn't the only encryption algorithm to dump data into a hexadecimal format. Many, if not all (sorry, crypto isn't a strong point for me, yet) computer encryption algorithms will manipulate the given binary bits and put out altered data in binary, which will most likely be displayed as hexadecimal data at some point. (Especially if viewed by a human.)  As I'm sure we all know, the purpose of an encryption algorithm is generally to protect and/or hide data. In terms of protection, think of internet packets. If you capture internet packets from your network with a program like Wireshark, you will find the data of each packet displayed as hexadecimal data. If the connection is encrypted (such as with a VPN), you won't be able to make sense of the hexadecimal data given to you. But, if it's not encrypted and you have information available as to the packet's formatting, you can easily decipher what it contains. (Multiplayer games created by Valve/ran on Valve's Source Engine are a great example of this. You can query a server and even decipher the response manually.)  As to your comment about ""finding pieces that matched"":  Some encryption algorithms suffer from the concept of ""collisions"" - where two different things put out the same hash. If memory serves, SHA1 is a prime example of a broken encryption algorithm. Because cryptographers work towards having absolutely no collisions result from their algorithms, it's very rare to find hashes that are the same or contain the same lines. (That's a concept of statistics and probability.) Almost as rare is to find a matching piece of the hash in something else. I believe another user found a matching piece in a Google Maps location URL recently.   One thing I do have to give you credit for is recognizing what kind of hash algorithm would put out an X long set of bytes/hexadecimal characters. That right there is a step in the right direction, in my opinion.   If you want to learn more about hashing (specifically password cracking), read through (and follow along!) this fun article on Ars Technica - How I became a password cracker. While it won't turn you into a 1337h4x0r, it'll give you a good idea of what goes on and give you some concepts to research.  While it feels like I'm rambling, I'm slowly working my way towards this next point...  3) Converting from Hex -> Binary -> Decimal -> ASCII without aim generally isn't a good idea. Many people come to this subreddit, try this exact process and claim ""I found something!"" while presenting a mess of random ASCII values. The subreddit wiki claims this to be a ""common mental trap,"" and does so for a good reason.   Go in with a well thought out (and logical) plan of action. Randomly converting very, very rarely shows results. (See the subreddit wiki for solved samples.)  This isn't a good idea because, back to point 2 about encryption algorithms, you don't know if the data represents a picture, a PDF, a UDP packet, or whatever. Add on the potential of a salted hashing algorithm (think of a private key needed to decyrpt, or adding a certain set of bytes on to the end of each set of data), and you could be converting gibberish to gibberish for the rest of your life. But, given enough time and computing power, it is possible to decrypt anything. But, modern hashing algorithms and related statistics make this very unlikely. :(  4) If you're interested in this kind of stuff, look around at various guides and resources available online! /r/LearnProgramming and /r/AskComputerScience (and their subreddit wikis) are possibly some great places to start!  Once again, not intending to be rude or condescending with this! :) Just trying to be informative! (And I'd rather type of stuff like this than work on homework... :P)"

But, it's highly unlikely as you would have to brute force (try every single possible option) the hash. Assuming it is an MD5 hash, if it is indeed a picture or a multi-word message, we'd be trying the same option forever.  Where we don't know what this data contains (i.e. a password, an email's message, a picture) or if it used any kind of salt/key, you could (literally) be trying different decryption methods forever.

Solving_A858,391z1p,Existential_Weiner,3,Mon Jun 8 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"a hash is sort of like a one way equation that you can run on any arbitrary string and it outputs a unique ""hash"". i.e. if you input ""abcdefg"" into some hashing function, the output might be something like a842d32c9, whereas if you input ""abcdehg""  your output could be something like 123a09ce87d. Since hashes are non-reversible (this is partially due to collisions that you can read about by yourself if you want), some people came up with the idea of rainbow tables, which are lookup tables where you have a plaintext, and the corresponding hash when run through some predefined hashing algorithm. It looks like that text file is a set of hashes. Since the website provides rainbow tables, you could assume that it will have the plaintext of whatever a858 was hashed from."

We humans work typically in Base 10/Decimal numbers (0-9), computers - at a fundamental level - work in Base 2/Binary (0-1). Hexadecimal is Base 16 (0-F, or 0-9 then a-f following 9) and is just another way of representing data.  For example, 125 in Base 10/Decimal is the same as 7D, which is the following in Binary/Base 2: 01111101.  It's very common to see data represented in Hexadecimal. Whether you're programming/debugging memory values, encrypting data or working with internet UDP packets, you'll see hexadecimal.   Assembly (or Assembler, as it's also called), however, is a whole different thing. It's what is considered a ""low level"" programming language, with languages such as Java (which Minecraft is made with) are called ""high level"" programming languages.  For some basic examples and to see some hexadecimal data in a programming situation, see this link: http://www.kipirvine.com/asm/gettingStartedVS2012/index.htm or better yet, this link: http://assembly.happycodings.com/code1.html    One ""trap"" that people tend to fall into is trying to piece things together that have absolutely no reason to be together.

However, assuming that the a858 posts are some sort of mathematical enigma (if they're not, everything in this sub is something of a moot point), the most logical way to approach decoding them is to consider the 16 characters, 0-9 and A-F, which appear in every post, and are the only characters to appear in any post, to be numerals in a base-16 number system, even if they do not align with the tradition of 0 being zero, 1 being one, A being ten, etc. A base-16 number system is hexadecimal.

To summarize: Simply because one thing looks a certain way, that does not necessarily make it so.  I'm not sure why there are so many of you that are having problems with this concept."
Solving_A858,3885n1,supremecrafters,2,Wed Jun 3 01:37:24 2015 UTC,"Intension:       In linguistics, logic, philosophy, and other fields, an intension is any property or quality connoted by a word, phrase, or another symbol. In the case of a word, the word's definition often implies an intension. For instance, intension of the word '[plant]' includes properties like ""being composed of cellulose"" and ""alive"" and ""organism,"" among others. Comprehension is the collection of all such intensions.  The meaning of a word can be thought of as the bond between the idea the word means and the physical form of the word. Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) contrasts three concepts:   the signifier – the ""sound image"" or the string of letters on a page that one recognizes as the form of a sign the signified – the meaning, the concept or idea that a sign expresses or evokes the referent – the actual thing or set of things a sign refers to. See Dyadic signs and Reference (semantics).   Without intension of some sort, a word has no meaning. [citation needed] For instance, the terms 'rantans' or 'brillig' have no intension and hence no meaning. Such terms may be suggestive, but a term can be suggestive without being meaningful. For instance, 'ran tan' is an archaic onomatopoeia for chaotic noise or din and may suggest to English speakers a din or meaningless noise; and 'brillig' though made up by Lewis Caroll may be suggestive of 'brilliant' or 'frigid.' Such terms, it may be argued, are always intensional since they connote the property 'meaningless term' but this paradox does not constitute a counterexample to the claim that without intension a word has no meaning.  Intension is analogous to the signified in the Saussurean system, extension to the referent.  In philosophical arguments about dualism versus monism, it is noted that thoughts have intensionality and physical objects do not (S. E. Palmer, 1999), but rather have extension in space and time.  Note: Intension and intensionality (the state of having intension) should not be confused with intention and intentionality, which are pronounced the same and occasionally arise in the same philosophical context. Where this happens, the letter s or t is sometimes italicized to emphasize the distinction.

Basically, let's assume you're right. The question would then be ""how do we determine the order?"", to which the naive answer would be "" try them all!"".  So, we have some mystical computer that can very quickly try different permutations of the code from a variety of posts.  I think we can both agree that eventually we would find a combination that makes up a valid program. The question is, how would we know whether it was the right program?  Thanks to this thing called the Halting Problem, it's pretty much impossible to decide if a nontrivial program will even stop at some point, much less output a useful answer. So ignoring all the practical considerations, after the first time we formed a valid program it's entirely possible that the program would be stuck in an infinite loop and it would be impossible without serious human intervention and analysis to decide if the program is correct or not.  I don't mean to shit on your parade, I just want to make sure you understand what you're asking for."

Solving_A858,37m0mo,bulitman,3,Thu May 28 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"I see.  Unfortunately, if a858 is using a secure, modern algorithm to encrypt his plaintext, no (practical) amount of computing power will decrypt it.  If he isn't, we'd have to guess his methods before we start. The problem with this is that there are more ways of encrypting something than we have time to check. It would be different if we had something on which we could base our guesses.   But it still could be fun to try...  My first 'guess' would be that he encrypts plaintext using the Vigenère cypher. The key is random and as long as the plaintext of one post. The key is changed when he takes a break from posting daily.   Edit: forget about my guess. Just realized there *are too many possible keys."
Solving_A858,37m0mo,bulitman,3,Thu May 28 18:10:05 2015 UTC,"Could still get lucky, you could also count character frequency, and maybe that would yield some results about the encryption algorithm and or encoding used?"
Solving_A858,37m0mo,KingZer0,3,Thu May 28 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"In cryptography there are four things: the plaintext, the ciphertext, the algorithm, and the key. In secure, modern cryptography, everyone is allowed to see the ciphertext and know the algorithm however it's (practically) impossible to deduce the key and therefore the plaintext. Also, even if we know the algorithm, plaintext, and ciphertext, it's not possible to identify the key.  Assuming a858 is using one of these techniques and we learn his algorithm, we wouldn't be able to find the key, or plaintext. If we know the algorithm and somehow have the plaintext of one post, we would not be able to decrypt the others.  Now, if a858 is not using a secure, modern method of encryption we would have a chance of decrypting his ramblings. I like to think this is the case (if he is securely communicating with someone why would he use reddit?).  If I am right, we have to manipulate his posts so that they are no longer random. And the method that makes one post less random has to make other posts less random.   And this brings us back to guessing. We could guess, for example, that the 1st  4th 9th 16th 25th ... characters are nonsense, take them out and see if the result is still uniformly distributed. If it isn't, we could try the same method on other posts. But, because we have nothing on which to base our guesses, we probably won't see results.  Maybe it would be a better use of our time to look for clues which could inform our guesses. Although I suppose we could do both at the same time.  I dunno... It might be hopeless but it's still fun.  Also, sorry about the long post. I'm not known for being concise."

Effort is appreciated, but this isn't something changed from random bytes to a legible product. But, good thinking on trying a step further than just a bunch of random ASCII text. I highly recommend reading through the sidebar links and the subreddit wiki, specifically this page.   Following the link I posted just up above, you fell into the common trap of translating a bunch of random bytes (the ""hex"") form to ASCII/random characters.   Batch files run a series of commands (see this page on ss64.com for some great coverage). For example, if you wanted to delete all files in a directory, you could create a batch script to delete each file, or delete the containing directory then re-create an empty directory for future use. Each of these commands are smaller programs, mostly shipped with Windows (such as the robocopy or ipconfig commands). Or, there can be programs such as youtube-dl that you can set up to be recognized through a batch file or command prompt.   In this case, there happened to either be a precise byte or character (a bell character, '\a' in C++) that caused the beep to happen. Then, there was the right symbol to ""pipe out"" (probably the wrong term...) text to a file. But, where things didn't have the proper syntax, it probably didn't do much else.   I'm not sure what kind of knowledge you have or seek about computers or data, but I recommend not giving up because this one didn't pan out.

The number of combinations quickly becomes staggering.  for instance if there were 50 hashing types being considered and we're dealing with 4 layers, that is 230,300 possible combinations of layers.    Simply brute forcing a solution to this would take (probably) longer than the age of the universe, considering each combination needs to be run through a decryption routine to be proved / disproved.  That is why Fragglet and Karmalist have been adding metrics to the auto analysis.

I decoded this by first dividing the post entitled 201505131317 into two columns of 32 digit hex codes in the same order. Then I numbered the lines starting from 0. Then I took the name  A858DE45F56D9BC9 and numbered each digit in the name according to their hexadecimal value.. (e.g. A = 10, 8 = 8.) There are 16 digits in the name so I took the first two digits (A which equals 10 and 8) Then I counted 10 down from the top of the code starting with 0. Then I counted (starting from 0) 8 hex codes in the order they appear from line 10. This gave me a specific string of hex codes. I did this for all of the pairs of digits in the name. After I had all of the hex codes, I took the last 16 digit hex code at the end of the post and put A858DE45F56D9BC9 after it. I took all of this and put it into a hex to ASCII numbers converter. I took the numbers then reordered them so that they were in ascending order then took these numbers and converted them into ASCII. Then I got the 2 lines of code that are found in my original post."

But each nibble has some kind of substitution, 1010 -> 1000 -> 0101 like the first bit is inverted and shifted to become 0101, then the next nibble is 1000 so the same thing occurs so the first bit is inverted again to give 1101.

This kind of chunking behavior happens whenever you convert a hexadecimal number to a binary number.  You can also see it going from the binary representation to the octal representation by padding the binary to a string whose length is divisible by 3 by adding two more 0s to the front and then chunking it into groups of 3.  001 in binary is 1 in octal, 010 in binary is 2 in octal, 100 in binary is 4 in octal, and so on."

Combining them makes the sound ku-uhn, and when read fast, it become like kwon. It is an interesting system that is capable of making various pronunciation. But as I said, out of millions of sound it can create, some of them are simply not used, because there are sounds that work better. In this case, there is a combination that a lot of words or name that is written 권, which is pronounced like gwon. Because this sound exists, 퀀 is just not really necessary. I believe one of the most complicated combination would be 뷁, which kind of became a meme back in the days. It has no meaning, but reads something like bwelk.

First of all, the letter combination you got is 'kwon' which means nothing, and is also a very unusual letter combination to use. I personally never had to read or write that combination. Also, when I open broken text files, I see some Chinese and Korean characters among a jumble of Roman alphabets, and most of them are very unusual combinations that nobody would ever use.

Solving_A858,31zmwi,Lukewalkinginsky,10,Thu Apr 9 12:09:51 2015 UTC,"I'm just thinking out loud, and my idea is that the last 16 char long hex value is used to decrypt the whole post, or even the previous / next post. Maybe A858 is using MD5 hash or SHA1 hash, but if that is the case then there should be some repeatable hashes since MD5(""hello"") is always the same, right? Yes, but maybe A858 is messing with the text! Lower case and Upper case? MD5(""Hello"") won't be the same as MD5(""hello""). So maybe the text is something like ""HeLlO"", so even if the word repeats itself in the message, the hash code won't be the same."
Solving_A858,31zmwi,Plorntus,4,Thu Apr 9 12:43:10 2015 UTC,I very much doubt it is md5 and if it is it would have been cracked a long time ago since people have run them through md5 databases. That being said it is possible to salt md5s or similar which means it would give a somewhat different result.   I cant remember the exact outcome but I did do a comparison on all posts to find duplicate 8 byte long hex strings to see if anything repeated and I found that there isn't really anything (apart from the actual decoded posts - or the more obvious 'its something' posts that have not been decoded) ever that repeats itself.  That being said I feel you may be falling into the trap of just blindly assuming its md5 or other encryption method due to the fact they usually encode into hex for easier storing/transmission.   Personally I think if it is something its going to be some really ridiculous long winded way that turns out to be similar for all posts. Unfortunately without actual clues (or clues that we have actually deciphered and not realised) its not going to be easy to do.

Solving_A858,304et5,kamalist,3,Tue Mar 24 11:50:18 2015 UTC,"Is this right?   That's correct. Note that the expected standard deviation depends on the message length - the longer the message, the more uniform it should be. The code assumes a binomial distribution. Anything outside of 6 standard deviations is considered non uniform.  You can find the code here"
Solving_A858,304et5,fragglet,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:51:30 2015 UTC,"How does binomaial distribution relate to the uniformness of his posts? I saw  the code, but it calculates stdev in a way differed from my (in my post above) and also I can't understand why criterion of unrandomness of data isn't the value of standart deviation?"
Solving_A858,304et5,fragglet,2,Tue Mar 24 15:00:44 2015 UTC,"First off, the specific code I'm referring to is histogram_analysis() here.  The code counts the number of occurrences of each byte value and then examines these counts. In the original message, the probability of a particular byte being a particular value is 1/256, so that's 'p', while the length of the message is 'n'.   Binomial distribution is used to statistically model discrete random events, like a sequence of dice rolls for example. In this case we have a 256-sided dice and we're throwing it 'n' times. As per the Wikipedia page, the mean of a binomial distribution is np, while the variance is np(1 - p) (and standard deviation is the square root of the variance).  So standard deviation depends on the message length. For example suppose you had a random message of length 256 bytes. On average you'd expect each byte value to occur once (mean = np = 1). But it's also very unlikely that with random data, each value would occur exactly once. In fact the standard deviation in this case is around 1.0 (it increases as the square root of the message size). But standard deviation is just the average difference from the mean. In practice on real world random data it can be more."
Solving_A858,304et5,fragglet,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:49:33 2015 UTC,"So, your program checks if the sequence of data is binomially distributed, doesn't it?"

Huffman encoding gives binary codes to the characters in the data, so the most frequent characters have the shortest binary code (so the whole encoded binary code will be shorter). Well first, Huffman code uses binary, and A858's code is in hex. Second, it's not commonly used for alphabetical letters (although it's possible to use it on them), mostly it's used for data transef. There is a shitton of type of encoding, so I don't think it has anything to do with Huffman."
Solving_A858,30135x,OrkMan491,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"Beware that your Huffman decoding doesn't invent patterns that aren't really there. Huffman encoding (compression) looks more random than regular data. If it didn't, that would imply that there was a pattern in the compressed text which could be further compressed. So, in general, Huffman encoding removes patterns.  That means that Huffman decoding adds patterns. A Huffman encoding is just bits so you could take random but, decode, and get bits that don't appear random! However, that's just the decoding. Not actually a pattern in the text."

Solving_A858,2w463o,supremecrafters,2,Tue Feb 17 16:29:00 2015 UTC,"Md5sum:       md5sum is a computer program that calculates and verifies 128-bit MD5 hashes, as described in RFC 1321. The MD5 hash (or checksum) functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file. As with all such hashing algorithms, there is theoretically an unlimited number of files that will have any given MD5 hash. However, it is very unlikely that any two non-identical files in the real world will have the same MD5 hash, unless they have been specifically created to have the same hash.  The underlying MD5 algorithm is no longer deemed secure, thus while md5sum is well-suited for identifying known files in situations that are not security related, it should not be relied on if there is a chance that files have been purposefully and maliciously tampered. In the latter case, the use of a newer hashing tool such as sha256sum is highly recommended.  Virtually any non-malicious change to a file will cause its MD5 hash to change; therefore md5sum is used to verify the integrity of files. Most commonly, md5sum is used to verify that a file has not changed as a result of a faulty file transfer, a disk error or non-malicious meddling. The md5sum program is installed by default in most Unix, Linux, and Unix-like operating systems or compatibility layers. Other operating systems, including Microsoft Windows and BSD variants — such as Mac OS X - have similar utilities (see external links). On FreeBSD this utility is called 'md5' and contains additional features.     Interesting: Cksum | Sha1sum | Md5deep | Validate (McAfee)   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Solving_A858,2trlg6,fuckingredditman,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:53:00 2015 UTC,maybe try shifting the ascii values of each character up / down the ascii table so you get different characters? it's only 26 possible values for shifting it so you might get text that makes sense out of that.
Solving_A858,2trlg6,robochicken11,1 point,Mon Jan 26 23:39:55 2015 UTC,"because there are repeating characters and the text might have been encoded with a different encoding table but the characters are usually in sequence in encoding tables, so shifting the ASCII value of each character before encoding it up to the character a, then b, etc. until there might be some text that makes sense would be a thing that might make sense to do."

Second column, row three: 0D0A203732353933 followed by 3932313520203931 in column three, row three. Go down further in column two and you will find another 0D0A instance very close to the first followed by another 3932 number in the third column, same row.   This repeats multiple times through out. Just go down the second columns and look for the 0D0A.  Just took another peaks, I see a pattern. 0D0A is only in Column two through five. When you find a 0D0A in column two go one column right then down two and you will find 0D0A just shifted in. Go right one column and down two rows and you will find 0D0A just shifted further in. Repeat until you hit column five where 0D0A is at the end. The sequence repeats over throughout the entirety of the post.  EDIT: Start with Column One Row One. Go right one Column and down two rows and you will find a sequence that begins with 0D0A. Go right one column and down two rows. You will find another sequence with 0D0A but it has been shifted to the right 4 characters. Go right one column and down two row and you will find another sequence with 0D0A but this time it has shifted to the right a total of eight characters from the original. Go right one column and down two rows and you will find another sequence of 0D0A but this time it has shifted twelve characters to the right of the original. Go right one column and down two rows and you will find another sequence with 0D0A in it but this time it has shifted another four characters from the last leaving the 0D0A as the last four in the sequence. The following row does not contain 0D0A in it (like the sequence is resetting). Go back to the Original 0D0A and count down nine rows and the same type of sequence begins all over again. After the first 0D0A in Column 2 row 2 the sequence I described above repeats every nine rows.

The part you want to look at is:   Statistical distribution: Uniform (<= 3.40 stddevs)   As this will usually tell you if its random data or not. If it says ""Possibly non uniform"" and has a mime type thats when you want to look into it some more otherwise you risk just wasting your time.   I created a few hundred graphs on plotly yesterday with histograms of the first 256 bytes and it seems like it supports it being completely random data."

Anyways, this could mean that these 'codes' are meaningless by themselves, but they lead to other places. And they need to be seemingly random and unique to differentiate them and keep them hidden and seemingly meaningless within the pages they appear on. Maybe each site could be a clue or lead to somewhere else.

The avatar seems to support the fact the blog being made on dec 1st as its EXIF data shows date created was this same day. There is no way of telling however if the data at the top of the site was showing before then. It is entirely possible that the heading is a mishap of some weird google search, incidents in the past have shown some sites change thier content based on what search link brought them there and usually updates with that content forever - I am not sure if thats possible on tumblr however. Chances are its someone just messing about posting it to the page and in no way linked.

In the case of one time pads, if someone captures the one time pad (eg. through arresting a spy who has a copy of it) then the messages can be decrypted. But it's the closest thing to a truly secure system that exists."
Solving_A858,2qd5n9,fragglet,12,Thu Dec 25 15:57:30 2014 UTC,"I just checked these out. To explain further: Discovering the value of any character in the encrypted message leaves absolutely no clue to the value of any other character. i.e. The encrypted values are not related to each other in any way, so you'd essentially have to ""break"" each character one at a time, which is totally pointless because there's no way to validate that you have the correct values."
Solving_A858,2qd5n9,jutct,5,Fri Dec 26 00:43:57 2014 UTC,"Yep. An interesting thing to note is that an encrypted message can be decrypted to any message depending on the one-time pad used. For example, suppose I take one of A858's posts. If I made a plaintext message of equal length, I could trivially construct a one-time pad that mapped from one to the other. So even if someone presented a one-time pad that decrypted a message, it wouldn't even prove anything.  I'm just using this as an example and this is not to suggest that I think A858 is posting messages that are encrypted using a one-time pad. There's no evidence for that.  The strength of the one-time pad system is precisely the fact that there is no cipher that can be broken, no possible way to get any foothold in decrypting the message. The only vulnerabilities are systemic ones - eg. if the pad is used twice for different messages, or if a copy of the pad is captured by an enemy (cold war spies used tiny code books  that were concealed in things like bars of soap - or even hollow coins)."

Solving_A858,2qd5n9,jutct,10,Sat Dec 27 06:43:05 2014 UTC,"Quantum Cryptography is an upcoming technology that is about as close as we're going to get.  The Laymen's version of how it works is that if the message is interfered with at all, besides it's destination, they'll be able to access it, but it'll jarble itself up and when it reaches it's destination, the receiver will also know it's been intercepted.  So yes, the message sent, can be caught but the person interfering will never know what was in it.  With how Quantum technology works, you'd have to break the laws of physics to be able to access it with out it scrambling itself.  So it's literally impossible to access a message, read it and then send it on it's way without the receiver knowing.  It's sounds really sci-fi and out-of-this-world, but it's a technology that's going to break through in the next 20-30 years.  Go do the research, it's really interesting stuff."

Solving_A858,2qb29o,kingphysics,6,Thu Dec 25 12:44:28 2014 UTC,"My thought was that if certain messages were critical or time dependent, missing a message would have the effect of influencing the following messages.  I'd guess that if the reader can automate message collection it could reference isitdown to check why a message may be missing.  I don't think every message will be critical.  To maintain secrecy I'd put greater than 80% noise to just hide an encrypted message, so down time would be more likely to hit a noise message than a critical message. But should down time hit the 20% critical period, I'd be forced to do something to ensure the critical message was sent, causing an irregularity in noise to message - either repeating the message when a noise message should be sent or adjust the cipher to tell the reader that the message sent is not the expected noise but the critical message.   May be nothing, but could a quirk to exploit."

As for trying to say, crack these codes, no matter what amount of money you throw at a problem, even the NSA has limitations (like hiring any russian federalists who wouldn't even know they were helping the NSA).  Croud-sourcing a problem to the world (and doing it for free) is just one more way to get the job done.  Yes, hire as many codebreakers as you can.  And yes, buy/acquire as much tech to number crunch.  But why stop there?  Write a message in, say RSA-2048 and see if someone, ANYONE, can find a math weakness.    It's obvious that there are people both knowledgeable about crypto and also have time to number crunch.  It took an obscure russian mathematician to prove the poincare conjecture.  Maybe a redditor will crack the next SHA or RSA?

On very rare occasions, the buzzer signal is interrupted and a voice transmission in Russian takes place.  It has been active since sometime in the late 1970s or early 1980s, when the first reports were made of a station on this frequency.   Its origins have been traced to Russia, and although several theories with varying degrees of plausibility exist, its actual purpose has never been officially confirmed and remains a source of speculation.

Solving_A858,2mh5bk,meme_forcer,11,Sun Nov 16 17:33:09 2014 UTC,"Yes. http://www.asciitable.com/ Hardware wise, there's fundamentally no difference between the decimal number 61, hex number 0x41, and the binary number 0b0111101, they're all just different ways to think about the same number.  Now, since computers have to store letters (of which there are 26 in the English alphabet) using binary, they say that each letter/character has an ASCII code (see above), which is a number that the computer can store as binary.  So the number 0x41 (hex) = 0b0111101 (binary) = 61 (decimal) = 'A' when interpreted as a character.  Hope this helps!"

You'll find a lot of results telling you how to change from Strings with hex characters in them to strings with english characters, but the important thing to note is that the NUMBER 0x41 (61) is the same thing as 'A', while the string '0x41' is actually stored on your machine as 4 different bytes, each of which has its own ascii code."

If you convert that to hexadecimals you will get A858DE45F56D9BC9 like usual. The first two 0's are not used, which gives us 64 digits. 4 binary digits per hexadecimal. A total of 16 characters.   I think since you converted it line by line, the 2nd line managed to get some digits that should have belonged to the first line (due to the two omitted 0's) which gave you some weird values.

Solving_A858,2l8dvk,fewdea,3,Tue Nov 4 04:43:24 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's using the same method of encryption everytime, in fact I'm fairly certain methods are ever changing. We've occasionally seen the odd post being decrypted, the only reason for only one being decrypted would be because something changes each time."
Solving_A858,2l8dvk,c0mpliant,5,Tue Nov 4 13:30:20 2014 UTC,"in fact I'm fairly certain methods are ever changing   What? Why? The ""decrypted"" posts were not encrypted to begin with. They were very obvious puzzles. As OP suggests, they were possibly to incentivize us to keep working. The other alternative is that he doesn't want it to be solved, in which case the ""decrypted"" posts were just his way of having fun with us. Either way, these are very clearly distinct from the remainder of his messages.  For the rest of the messages, if A858 is actually encrypting these posts and he wants them to be decoded instead of just posting arbitrary data, it's pretty likely that he is using the same crypto scheme for each, and it's likely that it either uses the same key or the key for each post is somehow included in that post."
Solving_A858,2l8dvk,kevin_at_work,1 point,Tue Nov 4 19:40:03 2014 UTC,"bingo.  I doubt very much he is changing the encryption from post to post, unless the odd 8-bit hex at the end has something to do with the key.  FWIW, I mentioned here how I tried decrypting, assuming 3DES, using his username, and the 8-bit string, and a combination thereof as the encryption key with no success.  I did not try to break the encryption though, which would be the next step - but not something I (ethically) have the compute power to bother trying."

Solving_A858,2l8dvk,6anon,1 point,Tue Nov 4 13:44:20 2014 UTC,Yeah NO. The prominent variation in posts we cannot solve is just data length. Everything else remains pretty consistent. Sure there might be a different key or some such - but the actual encryption process is likely the same (for the vast majority of broadcasts) because the product is very similar.  And why change the encryption if no-one can break it anyway!?  If you're certain that the method is constantly changing then how do you explain the regulated output? You would expect variance if the method is changed regularly. I have no doubt that the method has been improved over time - but we have also seen old posts get wiped; that's much more indicative of removing outdated or irrelevant data.  Additionally the solved posts are immediately picked up because they do not follow the pattern and as such stand out like a sore thumb.
Solving_A858,2l8dvk,Kbnation,0,Wed Nov 5 15:45:58 2014 UTC,He is definitely changing his method but why? I think the most sensible theory would be that he is making it easier to decode because it's been years since he started doing it and no one decoded anything serious yet.
Solving_A858,2l8dvk,Xkromas,2,Tue Nov 11 06:56:19 2014 UTC,It isn't a one-time pad if it's used more than once. You're probably thinking of a generic key that happens to be the same length as the message.

Granted, its long and shows no evidence of a salt or anything, so MD5 isn't likely.   Can you elaborate?  I didn't quite follow.  From what I know an MD5 hash, salt or no salt are indistinguishable.  Both result in a 32 character hex string."
Solving_A858,2l8dvk,omrsafetyo,1 point,Tue Nov 4 20:44:44 2014 UTC,"If it's straight MD5 or salted MD5, yes. If it's any kind of proprietary salt, there's additional tags that are added.   Hashcat provides an example table that shows some of the different hashes.   Specifically, I was thinking of how Wordpress stores passwords, and the tag that is added to the front of the hash."
Solving_A858,2l8dvk,6anon,2,Tue Nov 4 21:02:33 2014 UTC,"Okay, yes, I see what you're saying.  That's just the storage format though, and not the actual hash.  I explained that concept here using SQL Server's SHA-256+salt mechanism as an example.  But, that is the thing, those are just storage mechanisms, for a single string, and each string in a Wordpress PW database represents a single hash with a single salt.  I think the idea with the A858 posts is that if it is a hash, and it is salted, the 16 character ""odd string"" at the end would have something to do with the salt.  So if you send the format ""01dfae6e5d4d90d9892622325959afbe:7050461"" through hashcat, it should detect the 7050461 as the salt, and the rest as the hash.  But my idea would be a858 has some proprietary salt.  But, honestly, it seems unlikely he is depending on using like hashcat to decrypt those posts, but who knows."

Solving_A858,2kn1c4,fewdea,4,Wed Oct 29 03:01:54 2014 UTC,"Compression algorithms create files with known signatures in the first few blocks of the file.  1F 9D for tar.Z, 42 5A 68 for bzip2, etc. (more here)  The auto-analysis tool checks for known file types, and on the rare occasion we find a match, it usually is a false positive.  Plus, as far as I know, most compression software still maintains file names in basically raw text in the file, so you would still see some strings in there once you looked at the raw data with a hex editor, etc."
Solving_A858,2kn1c4,omrsafetyo,1 point,Wed Oct 29 03:31:44 2014 UTC,Unless it is a compression type that (A) Doesn't ID itself in the file and (B) Obfuscates/Encrypts the file names.
Solving_A858,2kn1c4,Krutonium,1 point,Wed Oct 29 06:22:46 2014 UTC,Would the character distribution also appear to be random if we were looking at a compressed file in binary form?   The problem with the question is the distribution is not random. It's uniform with an average of 3 standard deviations. Mathetmatically this is about as scrambled as it could be. It would be difficult to make it less coherent!  Compression doesn't do this. To make any progress the data must first be processed in a meaningful way to generate some coherence.

For instance, in this post, I created a rainbow table of hashes for words found in A858's ""solved"" posts.  I then used those hashes to search, and didn't find anything.  But basically, it gives you a database for comparison, and when you find a match, you simply look up the decrypted value in the rainbow table.  A salt is extra, random information that is added to the beginning of the word prior to hashing.  So if your salt is the 16 characters at the end of a post (b643698fce4f3865), when you MD5 hash EYE5, instead of 6ce11218dd0b54502f6a25a994010284, you are actually MD5 hashing  b643698fce4f3865EYE5 and you get 0478feb7dfb05680a303f9157e788e3b.  So a salt is something that changes the output based on a known input, and makes it so you can't use a precomputed list.  So a salt is a prevention tactic against rainbow tables.  We are exploring other safeguards, such as ciphering the raw hex with the last 8 bits, or a map from the solved post, etc.  So far no luck.  Edit:  As a use case, SQL Server uses SHA-256 with a salt to store SQL passwords.  So when you create your password, SQL takes your password:  MyAw3s0m3P@$$  Instead of running the SHA-256 hash on that directly, it generates a salt:  0200F1202F8A  When it hashes the password, it takes your PW and appends the salt:  MyAw3s0m3P@$$0200F1202F8A  And then it gets the SHA-256 hash of that (1dee7328c1dc04f187a74d7fd597ab7629723cd73353503763651704f70ce024).  SQL Server stores the salt with the hash in the password - so it stores it in the DB as: <salt (**0200F1202F8A**)> + <hash of PW + Salt> or: 0x0200F1202F8A1dee7328c1dc04f187a74d7fd597ab7629723cd73353503763651704f70ce024  SQL Server can't decrypt this password any better than you can.  The salt prevents against having a rainbow table for lookups.  So when you enter your password to authenticate, it grabs the salt out of the password field, appends it to the password you provided, calculates the SHA-256 hash, and then compares them.  If they match, you provided the correct password.  The result is that, although the salt is stored plainly for you to see, you DO have to calculate a new hash for each guess before attempting the password.  Without the salt, you could take a dictionary (rainbow table) and look for the SHA-256 hash of the password, and get the password rather easily.  With the salt, you have to compute each iteration by using the salt - so your rainbow table is useless."

Just spaces, and depending on your resolution, things will be broken up differently.  Beyond that, the posts are still too uniform to have a simple cipher applied. That is the difference between regular posts and solved ones. The solved ones were not only intended, bit expected to be solved because some relatively simple encoding was applied.

Solving_A858,2k3go1,fewdea,1 point,Fri Oct 24 12:43:43 2014 UTC,"I read something on another post talking about how the posts are grouped. For instance, the most recent posts are 38 groups of 16 bytes each, plus the last bit, which is 8 bytes.  The auto-analysis tool does not appear to group or analyze message based on their length. If a858 is posting binary data from a file, it's obviously not going to be terribly useful in 616 byte chunks...   which reminds me... I saw a post on reddit recently, perhaps a TIL, saying how the number of the devil was actually 616, but due to transcription errors, it became known as 666. But I digress.  Has anyone tried looking at the data as grouped by message length?"
Solving_A858,2k3go1,all_of_zimbabwe,1 point,Tue Oct 28 02:14:32 2014 UTC,"So many possibilities though.  You could take the rsync idea of the rolling checksum.. check for meaning in the first byte, the second byte, the combination thereof, etc. etc. etc. You can try grouping it any manner you want, but without a key to decrypt, mostly it's useless.  The posts are too uniform to be meaningful with decyption  - the randomness in indistinguishable from encryption.    The lengths, as well as the trailing odd bits are definitely puzzling, unless someone has an actual idea to test, it gets us no where.  The auto analysis tool spots occurrences where a known procedure for decrypting the post has been shown.  So unless someone can demonstrate something that works, it's hard to add random functionality to it with no reason.  Also, the source code is available on github if you want to contribute.  edit:  I'm going to post an ideas thread tomorrow.  Ideas I've had, how they were ruled out, what holes are still left to look at, etc. I'll be welcoming ideas that can be tested."

I know it's silly to try every 2048 bit rsa key, because, wow there's like quadrillions.  I guess what I'm asking is, are there any ways we could determine what sort of crypto algorithm that is being used? I mean, if we're trying to crack SSL, we can take a look at the website cert and have a good idea of what we're working with. Is that the case here? And once/if we're able to determine the encryption, maybe we could start looking for known exploits?  I have to wonder. There's two possibilities. He's either trolling us with very secure data and the random solvable post. Or he actually wants us to break it, and would therefore make it difficult, but not impossible to crack. Maybe he's using an old version of something that is already broken?"

I wouldn't expect someone to regularly change an automated mechanism.  Plus, the premise is ""if we get close"", which has never happened in the current automated format, only for a few outliers."
Solving_A858,2k1kzf,omrsafetyo,1 point,Thu Oct 23 03:27:13 2014 UTC,The encryption may be the same due to the output being uniform. However there is certainly differences in the data length and occasionally a broadcast with have a fluctuating data length or a consistent data length across multiple posts.  This could imply some variance in the process of submission - which may include variance in the encryption process. It should be noted that the actual output is pretty consistent in terms of 'how scrambled' the eggs are.
Solving_A858,2jyi1s,2LateImDead,10,Wed Oct 22 03:11:07 2014 UTC,"Also, the new post saying tool among you or tool, among you, hints towards a simpler option. A858 could be calling everyone who came along on the AskReddit train a tool, but be hinting that they'll figure it out. Or tool among you, the other interpretation, could mean that the correct method has already been discussed, but was wrongfully debunked.   I've floated that already, my guess is that tool is referring to actual tools, ""new eyes"" is pretty much an acknowledgement of the new crowd, insulting the newbies seems kind of callous, OTOH prodding us about having skipped on a proper decryption tool/technique etc seems more fitting.

Solving_A858,2jyi1s,GeoffreyYeung,3,Wed Oct 22 14:46:40 2014 UTC,maybe we have to decode something to arabic charactersets (if its meant to be read RTL that could be a hint).

Solving_A858,2jyi1s,noihavenotmetted,6,Wed Oct 22 21:10:45 2014 UTC,"To answer the original question posed however, no I don't... It is almost universally accepted now that all of A858's ""scheduled"" posts are bot-generated; and the encryption is likely very complex. When I look at the several messages we have solved, I see a human hand behind them. The grid-making, the simple format conversions, the rough spelling and formatting seems very organic and man-made. I think that decoded posts such as these may give us some insight into the person behind A858, and how they approach cipher-making, but I don't think that analysis of those spurious few posts will bring us any closer to cracking the massive walls of hex data, unfortunately :/"
Solving_A858,2jyi1s,CaitlinDandsomeshit,8,Thu Oct 23 01:39:41 2014 UTC,"First of all, since the ""AMONG YOU"" is separated from the rest of the text and oriented horizontally, I take that to mean ""I am among you"", as opposed to ""there is a tool among you"". I think it is an assurance that they are still closely monitoring this sub's progress... As for the ""tool"" reference, has anyone else considered that the message ITSELF may be the tool? I noticed there was another post made about 2 minutes after this one. Is it possible that this post and one of the adjacent (or nearby) posts contain the SAME message, one for us to easily discover, and the other using A858's standard encryption protocol? Perhaps A858 has given us an input and an output, hoping that someone can make their way from point A to point B and at least figure out the algorithm being used? If they are posting MD5 hashes, perhaps somebody could hash the translated message and see if the output matches any nearby posts? Might be way too much brute-forcing and variability for this to be feasible, but it's a thought..."

No answers is connected to amoung you by hash marks (just like NEW and EYES, NO and ANSWERS, and STILL and WEAK. STILL WEAK and TOOL are directly adjacent based on the hash marks bordering.  It looks to me as if all related words are adjacent via the hash marks, and all unrelated words are separated by whitespace when the non-meaningful phrases are extracted.

Consider that even if we use a really old, low quality sound format (like 11025Hz 8-bit PCM) most of the posts would only be about 1/10th of a second long. Not much time in which to perform a frequency analysis.  The other thing to bear in mind is that the auto-analysis system analyzes distribution in the posts and most of them are (uniform) random. So the frequency distribution is just going to be random too (if you convert them to sound it'll just sound like noise you get from a detuned radio)."

If you look at the characteristics logged by your bot - there are well defined groups of posts that go together. It kinda surprised me that nobody seemed to have made a thread about this pattern. link  The pattern may not be present in the characteristics of some of the earliest posts. It is there for the majority of them - so it's easy to separate groups based on;   post title (consistent format, result of automated process, falls out of sync and spills into adjacent mins) identified time zone (why else would this be implied) data length (static format for most groups - but also variable in certain groups which suggests - suggests multiple different protocols) interval between posts (remains constant over a broadcast group)   One of the more recent groups contains 133 individual posts. This broadcast pattern was repeated for 11 days!  This theory is based off analysis of sequential posts made before. And that i can't ignore a pattern - these properties could be obfuscated easily - unless they are important separation and grouping of data."

The data certainly needs to be processed before it can be interpreted in any case. It's clear that almost all of the posts have had the content thoroughly obscured which is why we get that uniform distribution.

Solving_A858,2jumbg,Kbnation,2,Tue Oct 21 02:25:28 2014 UTC,Yeah there are distinct groupings - check out the pattern of 'broadcasts' here. I'm going to have to update the groups and highlight the isolated 'special' post we got today.  It's very much easier to see the pattern if you look at the auto-analysis archive which also assigns a time zone to the submissions based on the difference between the time in the thread title and the actual time it was submitted to reddit.

Solving_A858,2jumbg,xxxllm,1 point,Tue Oct 21 02:44:53 2014 UTC,No the time zone is implied through the difference in the time expressed in the post title and the time recorded by reddit.  Look at this example; http://a858.soulsphere.org/?id=2jtvjk   The post title expresses a time at 7.22am on Tuesday Oct 21st Reddit recorded that this was submitted at 10.22pm on Monday Oct 20th The difference between these two times identifies UTC+9   There is no need to actual travel anywhere to create this impression however it does neatly divide the posts in sets of distinct 'broadcasts'.  We could interpret these as multiple users broadcasting from differerent places. They might be instructions sent to different time zones. It's unlikely to be a858 actually travelling due to the distance required and the amount of time to do it - it's also uneccessary to create the effect.

Solving_A858,2jrvdj,chesszz,3,Mon Oct 20 10:47:07 2014 UTC,I've got some theories but they might be a little bit 'out there' in terms of feasibility. The 16 digits = 8 bytes of hex   a858's full name is 8 bytes and is maybe useful for cracking a key (no idea how that could even be remotely possible) last part of each block is 8 bytes and is maybe useful for cracking a key some data may be intentionally missing or a submission may be intended to 'pair' with another submission to create a full set of 16 byte blocks the last 8 bytes are an indication that the data is intended to be processed into another form (for example they may be md5 hashes that are 'rearranged' and the final 8 bytes are the key to rearrange the md5) maybe the last 8 bytes are meant to be discarded and have only been included to make the deciphering process impossible (which would be downright unhelpful)   I admit that this is not particularly useful speculation. If you want to read up on the impact of block size in cryptography.
Solving_A858,2jrvdj,Kbnation,3,Mon Oct 20 11:27:05 2014 UTC,"I was thinking about the last 16 digits yesterday. Even though I know literally nothing about cryptography, I have a pretty good feeling these aren't MD5 hashes. At any rate, they aren't MD5 hashes of words. None of them, to my knowledge, repeat in any posts. The last 16 digits pushes my doubts even more.   Your second point, however, might be a good idea. How much computing power would one need to generate every possible MD5 hash combination from the ones he posts?"
Solving_A858,2jrvdj,oblonglamppost,1 point,Mon Oct 20 13:20:10 2014 UTC,That might generate false positive matches - if we're going to try every possible combination then it's guaranteed to show up words or even sentences just due to the random process.  In their current state they are not md5 hashes. It may be possible to rearrange the data with some form of consistency (a pattern) so that it all becomes md5 hash. But this is pure speculation - it is not based on any evidence and there is no clue or leads to what that pattern may be.  The only reason why i even thought about it in the first place was due to the .NET code which was found here
Solving_A858,2jrvdj,Kbnation,2,Mon Oct 20 14:16:12 2014 UTC,"That's true, but I do feel that, given the nature of this code, that false positives wouldn't be difficult to recognize. If the text is indeed coherent language, it wouldn't be impossible to pick out the most likely option. I might try to write a program to try this out on a 32 bit segment. It can't hurt to try.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to get it to work though. I've been a computer science major for about two months, haha."
Solving_A858,2jrvdj,oblonglamppost,1 point,Mon Oct 20 15:29:49 2014 UTC,"Well it's a bit of a trap really. And there's no guarantee that it will produce coherent text either - the user has demonstrated that messages may be hidden in a grid, may decode into assembly language, text may be hidden in the pixel difference between multiple gif's via steganography.  At least one decoded into a plain text quote.  But i think that progress can be made - it's probably a good idea to focus attention on one of the isolated messages. Since the majority of submissions appear to be part of a larger broadcast. If you take a look at the auto-analysis you can see a pattern in the submissions to determine distinct broadcasts and this means we can determine the start and length of a group of submissions."
Solving_A858,2jrvdj,Kbnation,1 point,Mon Oct 20 15:42:49 2014 UTC,"Block size (cryptography):       In modern cryptography, symmetric key ciphers are generally divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers. Block ciphers operate on a fixed length string of bits. The length of this bit string is the block size. Both the input (plaintext) and output (ciphertext) are the same length; the output cannot be shorter than the input — this follows logically from the Pigeonhole principle and the fact that the cipher must be reversible — and it is undesirable for the output to be longer than the input.

Solving_A858,2jrvdj,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Oct 20 11:27:12 2014 UTC,Why is everyone so bent on md5? My money is on AES with some type of combination of the username/post name/last 16 digits being used as the key.
Solving_A858,2jrvdj,jeeebus,2,Mon Oct 20 17:44:25 2014 UTC,A858 did use md5 hash to say 'Gold' and 'ThankYou' after somebody gave reddit gold. This was sent in a PM and you can find the details.  Maybe there are other reasons for md5 to be popular but i am new here so i am still catching up.  You could be on to something with some 8 byte combination taken from the date / title and the last 8 bytes of the data being a set that is used as a key.  Tell me what you know about AES - is there a reason why you prefer it (just curious)?
Solving_A858,2jrvdj,Kbnation,3,Mon Oct 20 18:21:23 2014 UTC,"The only reason I would lean towards AES vs MD5 is because AES is actually an encryption algorithm whereas MD5 is just a hashing function. We obviously don't know A858's purpose, but the only reason I personally would store information online like that is so multiple people/computers could access and read the information at a later date (sort of like a secure public database, by using a timestamp as the post title it ensures the information has a unique identifier sortable by date).  With AES encryption multiple users can decrypt the info as long as they have the correct key. With MD5 they can't decrypt and read the unknown information, it's only useful for verifying known information (e.g. passwords or file integrity checkers).  If he was using MD5 to just verify file integrity of program files, then we would see a lot of repeated MD5 hashes in his posts of the files that remained unchanged during the latest revision. Since this isn't the case, the information being posted is probably unique. If multiple people/computers already have this unique information, why post it online using a one-way hashing function? It's seems somewhat unpractical.  If I actually had the time to dig, I would start with trying to find the cipher using public info (we know he has used MD5 in private messages, so perhaps an md5 hash of his username / post title / last 16 digits of post to determine the key) and decrypting the post content using AES / Twofish / Serpent (or any other 128 bit encryption algo)."

Solving_A858,2jqbx9,fragglet,6,Mon Oct 20 01:57:51 2014 UTC,"Fragglet,  Be prepared to read. This is entire tldr is for you.   You need to consider a few things which I will outline below.   *1. Don't be so high and mighty. Not only did I spend crazy amounts of hours working on ONE week of posts. Because FYI that's what all that is. It's only posts from the week of 6-12-14 but claiming there is no visible structure, no explanation or even a post # is flat out insulting. Some are labeled funny but guess what happens when you look at what folder they are in or oh no, opening the file! Magic happens. Yep. Magic.   *1a. Learn to post constructive feedback.   You're not only discouraging myself from posting and be involved but you are also being a huge pita for the community. Do you do anything other than complaining on every new post?   If you want to complain go right ahead. Not like I see you making any contributions besides being a huge detriment to those who put fourth their findings.   Let's examine this:   Do we even know when was the last time a post was solved? It was so long ago I can't even remember... if it was even ""solved"" to any degree either. At this point, anyone posting ANY data, in whatever form, is welcome. At least its ""something"".     On crypt-analysis:  Are you even kidding me right now? Have you ever done any crypto? Last time I checked decrypting an unknown data stream and identifying the types were dealing with here takes a significant amount of trial and error, which is exactly what you're looking at. A bunch of trial and errors. The text files Fragglet are literally labeled by A858's post number. Some of them are randomly named but if they are located in the correct folder which miraculously happens to be entitled with the post it came from. Again, we can thank magic for that. Amazing what happens when you stop being a huge pita for a minute and take a look at what's in front of you.  For example: 44231231 imp.txt  I see quite a lot of explanation in this one what I was doing. I see typed out actually, here let me show you:    each block is is encrypted with 'insert cipher here'   key is the sha256 of the corresponding password iv is the ripemd 160 hash of the password clear text of blocks 1,2 etc are the same block 0 corresponds to the admin key  exchange two blocks in the control file ; this inverts the role of their key eg private <-->public  worse - shred <----> private  exchanging just the single ascii characters that identify the block is enough    From the same file:  Further down, says ""shifted right 15"" during rot15.     I see more than enough to follow most text files in there.  Like I said, in my OP, I posted, EVERYTHING I HAD. If you don't like looking at data, you probably shouldn't be involved with A858 or doing any type of data related analysis sorry to say. If opening my text files is a hassle I can understand why there is friction between us here.   There are more examples of this but, not my problem at this point. I simply just dumped my data for you to harass me about.    Fragglet: How organized is all your data you have on A858. Did I just make case and point here? I'm going to go and say your data is far from this perfect world of file names contained in an elegant visible structure and order.   No one has time or the attention span to organize fancy flow charts, graphics and proofs for you to just complain about those too. Just saying. Someone has to put the nail in the coffin.    *2. I don't accept challenges from lazy, incompetent reddit trolls. I suppose I should say that that is simply my perspective as that's all you seem to do to every time I post something. I may be wrong but you hate me for some odd reason. I would like to know.   Sorry to disappoint you. I also don't accept challenges from those who consistently talk down to and belittle them.   *3. Those who want to sift through it will, the ones that lack the ability to use google, copy and paste or use the scroll wheel to look at it, will simply go ""rawr im Fragglet"" and reply with some inane statement commanding them to do whatever it is you want, followed by a few insults to their intelligence. Hope you get my point because I'm doing the same thing you do to me so... word cotton.    On the constant reminder to properly format all our data:  I'm confused as to why you think I should adhere to your rules for formatting and hand holding. Ain't nobody got time for that.    On step by step guides in text files:  I see plenty of evidence that I've done WAY more than you have. What have you been doing? Besides being a huge pita to me for no reason. Maybe I would have time to do some formatting if I didn't have to go TLDR your erroneous replies to get the topic back on track just to have an intelligent discussion about it. Guess that's out of the question. Good job promoting the community mr. moderator, got the exact opposite of what you were going for.    On being a pita for no reason on multiple occasions:  This is your second hash out towards me. What's your problem here? All I see is myself and a few others trying to help and you c derailing everything including progress.     *4. If you actually, you know, were apart of the community for solving_a858 like you apparently are, you would have noticed that there is an IRC channel which, guess what? Where we talk about what were doing! It's an amazing concept. I have never once seen you in it and I'm sure if you were, you wouldn't be begging me for flowcharts, graphics, step by step guides and a 3hr youtube walk through on it. It's not going to happen.  *5. You're trying to solo A858.   Stop being dumb. Get into the irc channel, talk with the community and stop being a huge scumbag to me. People are trying to contribute (like myself) and you have done nothing but be a huge pain in my butt.

Open up a text file, start converting base values, paste the output, sort through whatever you can think of just continute till you run out of ideas then save it.   It's not difficult at all to follow if you're not a moron and know THE MOST BASIC STEPS like reading from left to right, top to bottom. The format of my text files.   Glad that's cleared up now.

On fragglets trolling    http://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/comments/27anje/is_u73686f7274627573_a_troll/chz5pl0   Please tell everyone one more time how we all should be showing all our maths work. Wanna know why no one shows their maths work on this? Because doing it by hand is not only complicated but has a high probability for error and time to compute by hand would be inefficient to say the least, and ain't nobody got time for that.    You need to understand that in the real world, you don't get a ""careful sequence of steps"" with to do something, nor do you get an explanation that you like. Did you go to college? If so, yeah, you should know this by now. Professors don't have time to explain to someone why you shouldn't be long handing decryption algorithms. It's common sense. Get a calculator, write a script but you're just really stupid if you are doing all the calculations and conversions with a pencil and paper. For that I feel bad for you.    Lastly, On using ""big words""  Using industry standard words such as, ""base"", ""stream cipher"" and all those other big words I used previously are literally describing the process and step by step guide you're looking for. It's a definition which describes the process on how to get the proper output.  I'm going out on a limb here but from my pov, saying I wrote in ""Star Trek-Style techno babble"" that, ""sounds impressive"" because I, ""Don't know any better"" is probably the wrong approach as I know what they mean. They just don't have any meaning for you because you don't have any idea what or where they fit in the grand scheme of things."

Look at the fragmentation in your reply! It's no surprise that your work on a858 might be a little difficult to follow.  You even started to explain the method you used in your notes... but then very quickly abandoned breaking it down into steps or explaining why you did something and what you were aiming to achieve.  I get that deciphering stuff requires a lot of trial and error - but honestly you need to give some indication of what direction or discoveries have been made for anyone to be expected to follow up. Without explaining the method or clarifying your interpretation of the result it becomes difficult to find value or repeat the process.  To be fair the reason why people use a standard layout in experimentation is to make it easier to work as part of a team and build on previous works - I'm sure you get that and i have no intention to patronize.  You criticize fragglet for being unconstructive or unhelpful. Yet you are unwilling to educate anyone looking at your method. Completely and aggressively refusing to step people through your process! Anyway thanks for posting your work. You really need to learn how to take criticism; You should never disregard negative feedback on your work but rather look at the reasons for the negative feedback. ""Haters gonna hate"" is almost always incorrect and is simply a way to create an excuse and mentally deflect the criticism rather than acknowledge that something may need improving.

Solving_A858,2jqbx9,Diasparo,3,Mon Oct 20 14:15:37 2014 UTC,You seem mad. Calm the fuck down.  And you have ignored the explanation i gave you for the negative feedback you received. There is no point in arguing over negative feedback - either you can take criticism and adapt or learn or you are stubborn and unwilling to accept criticism.  Just to make it abundantly clear to you; I am telling you that arguing with negative feedback is counter productive. It achieves nothing. If you think it's troll then ignore it. If it's valid criticism then maybe consider refining your work. But do not bother to argue with it. Everyone has a right to their opinion and you won't change it by getting irritated.  To make it real simple for you;    It can be confusing to interpret your method. You have provided no reasoning other than 'trial and error' which makes it impossible to judge the value of a particular outcome. You make no conclusions on which process was successful. Or how to interpret a partial success. (maybe it is buried in the work) This leads to a situation where it is hard to build upon or reproduce your results.   Hopefully this helps to explain why you received negative feedback. I have no doubt that your intentions are good!  If you expect collaboration then you shouldn't immediately expect people to be on the same page as you. Nor is it appropriate or acceptable to tell people to read up and study your work when claiming that it's value is only a partial success. It should be easy to reproduce this partial success so that people can skip to the end and start working on the interesting part. (to put it bluntly)

This is the essence of how academic work is conducted (ie. academics publish papers, journal articles etc.). I know that we're just investigating some Internet mystery and it isn't such a big deal as academic research, but the same principles apply. I just want to be transparent so that others can follow along who weren't present when a particular conversation was had in a small IRC channel. This includes people in the future who discover the A858 mystery and want to contribute.  If nothing else, the Drive folder that you've posted here is a perfect example of why Reddit is a much better medium for these discussions than something like IRC. You've posted a folder full of random, assorted text files, for most of which it's impossible to determine the context in which any investigation occurred. What's really needed is structured and documented analysis. Anything that can be said on IRC can also be said on Reddit, and here we get the advantage of structured comment threads where discussions can be followed.

Solving_A858,2jqmsk,tempnamekiller,4,Mon Oct 20 00:29:28 2014 UTC,This is pretty much the first question i asked as well.  So i looked at the auto-analysis and started to record the pattern in the submissions - take a look  The idea was to find unusual posts. Anything that stands out - perhaps uncover messages that are unique or isolated that may be more accesible to cracking.  But that's my approacj because the large blocks of data are a bit tough to begin with and generally decode into a mess of text. Also you've got to consider that there may be another layer to each puzzle - there's no guarantee that the output will be a simple string of text. Maybe it needs to be printed out and have a another piece of card with holes in it to read the message like this.  It's worth doing a thorough analysis of the solved submissions. See if you can repeat the solution yourself. This might provide you with a better insight into how to interpret something after it is decoded (that's what i'm looking at now anyway).
Solving_A858,2jqmsk,Kbnation,1 point,Mon Oct 20 00:44:27 2014 UTC,Any post that is special gets auto picked up and flagged on the archive.

Solving_A858,2jqmsk,MrArron,3,Mon Oct 20 01:22:27 2014 UTC,Well this is true - however it was also confirmed by /u/fragglet that ones like this are false positives.  The archive flags a submission by trying to read the file type at the start of the data and occassionally it throws up a false positive. You are correct that the text ones are are legit (not false positive) and have been demonstrated to be easier to decipher.  What i have done is show that there are distinct groupings which makes it easier to isolate groups in the submissions regardless of the file types method. To make progress it would seem appropriate to search for the simplest messages to crack and i'm using this pattern to provide a way a guaging the complexity.

Solving_A858,2jn7cq,Kbnation,4,Sat Oct 18 22:33:46 2014 UTC,"My first thought is that the account is being ""time-shared"" between multiple entities, either different bots who have preset schedule that dictates which uses the account.   Or A858 is one entity working as multiple identities. Potentially using proxies to generate the different timezones and having each identity assigned a chain of proxies. Either way I feel its too precise to be a result of human action.  When human involvement occurs, there is less consistency, things slip over time and error patterns occur. Because this sub has existed for 2 years, I feel any recurring error patterns would have been identified by users.  UTC+1 seems to be significant for some reason, in the posts you've analysed, my guess is its coming from Europe rather than Africa in that timezone. Either A858 is European or using Europe as the main conduit for the majority of the post groups."
Solving_A858,2jn7cq,Eyclonus,2,Sun Oct 19 05:37:54 2014 UTC,It's highly suggestive of multiple users / bots isn't it! I think it would be better to avoid speculation and interpret these as grouped messages.  So the reason why i looked at qualitites such as interval between posts and the data length is because the various time codes or 'bots' are set up differently. It may be that they have different encryption protocols which leads to the different data lengths. They certainly have different intervals and the interval between posts can be seen to change albeit not in the middle of a broadcast.  UTC+1 may seem particularly dominent in the small sample that i analysed however you can see on the logs that it is by no means the dominant time code. I have not checked the time code of posts that were solved but that may provide a clue to the 'bot' which is used to post more accessible content.  Additionally i think it is important to mention that a858 seems to have deleted any posts that didn't follow this 'group' format.  Worth mentioning; If you go back far enough you can see multiple time codes broadcasting at the same time - July 2012 shows UTC-4 and UTC+9 posting alternately but they are hardly 'reacting' to one another since the posts are clearly automated.  This supports the theory that messages are seperated based on distinct properties.
Solving_A858,2jn7cq,Eyclonus,2,Sun Oct 19 14:56:07 2014 UTC,"So the reason why i looked at qualitites such as interval between posts and the data length is because the various time codes or 'bots' are set up differently. It may be that they have different encryption protocols which leads to the different data lengths. They certainly have different intervals and the interval between posts can be seen to change albeit not in the middle of a broadcast.   Those are the kind of points that make me think its several bots sharing the accounts, operating on a trigger condition that isn't precisely scheduled like date/time but something that is incidental to date and time. Broadcast is certainly the right term, as the posts come in with a specific interval between each one before stopping and seem to have a purpose for being produced in such a way.   Additionally i think it is important to mention that a858 seems to have deleted any posts that didn't follow this 'group' format.   Hmm, error correction? A858 clearly doesn't have too much of an issue with us trying to interpret the message or else the sub would have been private. This along with the access to historical posts tells me that they were removed because they were not part of the ""plan"", either because they were the result of errors in their automated process, or because they were a part that was scrapped due to no longer being relevant and A858 wanted to remove them to prevent muddying what I assume to be their archive. Either way, I feel the erased posts were consciously removed unless they have an automated process to remove incorrectly generated output from the rather than an error-checker to stop incorrect outputs being posted to the sub.   This supports the theory that messages are seperated based on distinct properties.   This implies that there is a seperate purpose for each cluster of messages. Say responses in a conversation or journal entries/book chapters. Though the nature of the code being used leads me to believe that the actual message is much too short for being any kind of textual-verbal message beyond a sentence or two."

When i mentioned posts being removed i was just making a reference that for the vast majority of these broadcasts they follow this pattern of grouping - but - there have been 'special' posts which were deleted. I'd like to keep an open mind as to the reason for their removal but i tend to agree that it was useful for a858 to remove them from storage.
Solving_A858,2jn7cq,Eyclonus,2,Mon Oct 20 01:00:07 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately my field of expertise isn't cryptography and I fudged a passing mark for programming. But my guess based on what I do know about coding is that either we're looking at a few words without grammatical adjustment but with a verbal meaning, or something with more attached meaning to the creator rather than a simple message. I feel that the decryption of the messages won't produce a simple statement in English, instead its likely to lead to a statement that has had steganography applied to it."
Solving_A858,2jn7cq,gmoney999,2,Mon Oct 20 01:38:09 2014 UTC,"I think you might be right there and it's a very compelling reason for the use of groups of data.  So we could be looking at the end result of taking the message, breaking it down into several almost identical data sets - but with the message embedded in differences between those data sets - and then encrypting it a couple of times.  I usually like to keep an open mind and avoid too much speculation - but this time it was just too satisfying to avoid indulging!"
Solving_A858,2jn7cq,reallyaninja,2,Mon Oct 20 01:56:38 2014 UTC,"Keeping an open mind doesn't mean you don't speculate, it simply means that you need to entertain two contradicting concepts until data is obtained that confirms or denies the concepts.  There are simple conclusions we can draw;    They're good with numbers (but we can't determine if they're a prodigy with natural talent or simply someone who worked hard and has tertiary level education in the field),  They work to avoid the common human errors (that we can observe at the levels of detail that people have publically analysed on this sub, this also raises the possibility of several people working together on A858),  They clearly don't care about concealment beyond the entertainment value and have a valid reason for doing it (we know this because the sub is public and reddit admin closed it and then reopened the sub which means either A858 convinced them there was no breach of reddit's ToS or there was potentially an order from a US government agency to reopen it, though if it were the latter my guess is that A858 is a fishing pond for cryptographer recruitment, or the content is under surveillance by authorities, though anyone doing illegal activities would have optioned for the sub to be private in the first place, excusing the possibility of pride and ego compelling them to boast about their uncrackable code. However the idea of the boasting falls down because someone this precise would be unlikely to have such an attitude)"
Solving_A858,2jn7cq,raceman95,4,Mon Oct 20 02:49:01 2014 UTC,"Keep this up!  Honestly I think this could be very useful.  When someone wants to encrypt something, well there are very strong methods to keep it protected.  But if A858 made some kind of human error, like revealed something by accident in timezone changes, that could lead to a real breakthrough."
Solving_A858,2jn7cq,jackeroojohnson,1 point,Sun Oct 19 06:19:44 2014 UTC,Hopefully it will allow people to focus their attention on short messages - maybe there are submissions that we were meant to solve but nobody noticed them.  Being able to categorise the messages is useful for locating unique submissions.
Solving_A858,2jn7cq,jackeroojohnson,2,Sun Oct 19 14:58:06 2014 UTC,"Thanks for doing this. I was doing some thinking... Is the UTC-6 submission the Merry Christmas one?  Also, could you add the deciphered posts to each respective group? The gif ones, the one with the users on it, etc.  That might give us some clues.  Finally, I was reading comments in a linked thread (this one) and this comment deciphers the meaning of the (at the time) sidebar. Up until very recently it was a dogecoin address (see this thread). This adds a lot more meaning to the 'sidebar is a clue for the current encription' thing. Is there any more data we can get on that?  EDIT: This post is also a very important piece of knowledge. It should be added to the wiki."
Solving_A858,2jn7cq,jackeroojohnson,1 point,Sun Oct 19 18:34:41 2014 UTC,I've barely scratched the surface in terms of grouping the messages. Truth be told i got tired after going through 20 odd pages on the auto-analysis (which is 400 submissions worth) - that takes my 'grouping analysis' back to around June this year. I did scan thru the rest and it seems to be a consistent format going way back.  The strange UTC-6 submission is here - http://a858.soulsphere.org/?id=28o545  If i had the time and ability i would write a bot to collect the submissions into groups based on the parameters detailed above... Unfortuantely i'm only good at pattern recognition and coding is not my forte!  It might be fun to learn how to write this bot tho - so maybe i'll come back to it when there's less to do at my job (or i get fired through obessively reading hashes of hex code)

Solving_A858,2jn7cq,wardrich,3,Sat Oct 18 23:02:37 2014 UTC,You have to also consider that the groups identified above are order from the most recent.  So in the order that they were submitted we have;   UTC+1 posts 2 times with a fixed byte length UTC+1 posts 2 times with a fixed byte length UTC+1 posts 21 times with a variable byte length UTC+3 begins posting   You may be right of course!
Solving_A858,2jn7cq,jackeroojohnson,2,Sat Oct 18 23:21:58 2014 UTC,"I was thinking about this earlier.   Are you certain no one else has proposed this idea before? This crazy nonsense has been going on for quite a while now.    Its blatant that all posts follow a pattern as if they were controlled by a bot, just before the pattern changes to something else, as if it were by some sort of will or forethought. The pattern of posts, create a series, the series of posts all seem to relate to the same content types of content contained in the post of that series. Not that we have any idea what that content may be, or the forethought behind the interrelated content thats contained in the series of posts.   In fact, if anything, A585, has been a clear 3 steps ahead at all times. To what end could be anyones guess.   I'm sure A585 knows they have an audience. I'm sure they feel like they're being watched. I wonder if A585 is intellectually lonely, and these are calls to whomever can put the puzzle together. There have been some who have come far and away in putting these crazy posts in any perspective we can understand. Though really and truly, it was only bread crumbs that had been intended to be found.   The cat and mouse scheme is a natural inclination. To be chased. To Chase. All of it is very exciting. This enigma, A585 has marked himself as a rabbit, and poor reddit the hound, is once again, on the chase. I wonder if this is Alices Rabbit, the skittish character who will take us down a wondrous rabbit hole of puzzles and cryptography. Who may never reveal themselves or they're true function and reason. And like that Energizer Bunny, A585, keeps on going and going and going..... . It's clear to me there is one controlling hand at the keyboard.  I wonder if theres a way we can engage A585 in more of a call and response, rather than a conversation we could never keep up with, or trying to decipher what's not intended to be known.   I wonder if there was something that gets A585's attention. Arouses A5 out of the dark. What that carrot would be, I wouldn't be able to suggest. As I stated before, this crazy nonsense has been going on for quite a while now."
Solving_A858,2jn7cq,robochicken11,2,Sun Oct 19 04:14:25 2014 UTC,"I did a few searches in the sub before posting this - i wanted to find out if anyone else had recognised the 'grouping' or possibly if there was any further analysis of the metadata on larger groups of submissions.  I decided to post a thread about it just in case it's relevant. It certainly seems to me that it is deliberate.  Speculating on theories - it could be an indication of multiple users posting, instructions sent to a specific receiver, or simply a clue to be built upon.  Either way it was fun to find a distinct pattern! I'm also hopeful that it may draw attention to 'isolated' messages which may be more accesible or intended to be decoded."

Solving_A858,2jm9k0,Kbnation,6,Sat Oct 18 16:52:00 2014 UTC,"Here is a theory for you;  I believe it indicates a connection between messages or grouping of messages. If you take a look at the auto-analysis you'll notice that the identified time code changes at the same time as the 'minutes' part of the post title  This could indicate that the post is submitted from another user logged into a858. The submissions are clearly made anfter encryption by a bot; these bots are set up slightly differently with different time codes and submit with a different post title.  It would appear to be significant.  Edit; there are other significant bits to notice from the auto analysis, when the time code changed from UTC-1 to UTC+3 we see that the posts are very rapid. They are also 2824 bytes compared with the UTC-1 posts which are 1416 bytes.  The auto analysis is a very useful tool to find 'unusual' posts which may be easier to decode. For example this recent post; http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9/comments/2fqvr2/201409072129/ ... permalink is quite different from the subsequent 8 pages of posts on the auto-analysis."

Solving_A858,2jh0bt,rednax1206,10,Sat Oct 18 06:21:49 2014 UTC,"Korean Air Flight 858:       Korean Air Flight 858 was a scheduled international passenger flight between Baghdad, Iraq and Seoul, South Korea. On 29 November 1987, the aircraft flying that route exploded in mid-air upon the detonation of a bomb planted inside an overhead storage bin in the airplane's passenger cabin by North Korean agents.  The two agents, acting upon orders from the North Korean government, planted the device in an overhead storage bin before disembarking from the aircraft during the first stop-over in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. While the aircraft was flying over the Andaman Sea to its second stop-over in Bangkok, Thailand, the bomb detonated and destroyed the Korean Air Boeing 707-3B5C. Everyone on board the aircraft, 104 passengers and 11 crew members, most of whom were South Koreans, were killed. The attack occurred 34 years after the Korean Armistice Agreement that ended the hostilities of the Korean War on 27 July 1953.  The two bombers were traced to Bahrain, where they both took ampules of cyanide hidden in cigarettes when they realised they were about to be taken into custody. The male of the pair died, but the female, Kim Hyon Hui, survived and later confessed to the bombing. She was sentenced to death after being put on trial for the attack, but was later pardoned by the President of South Korea, Roh Tae-woo, because it was deemed that she had been brainwashed in North Korea. Kim's testimony implicated Kim Jong-il, former leader of North Korea, as the person ultimately responsible for the incident. The United States Department of State specifically refers to the bombing of KAL 858 as a ""terrorist act"" and, until 2008, listed North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism.  Since the attack, diplomatic relations between North Korea and South Korea have not significantly improved, although some progress has been made in the form of two Inter-Korean Summits. Kim later released a book, The Tears of My Soul, in which she recalled being trained in an espionage school run by the North Korean Army, and being told to carry out the attack personally by Kim Jong-il. She was branded a traitor by the DPRK after seeing South Korea and becoming a critic of North Korea. Kim now resides in exile, and under constant tight security, fearing that the North Korean government wants to kill her.  ""Being a culprit I do have a sense of agony with which I must fight,"" she said at a press conference in 1990. ""In that sense I must still be a prisoner or a captive—of a sense of guilt.""

Solving_A858,2jhnnq,autowikibot,3,Fri Oct 17 16:21:51 2014 UTC,"Voynich manuscript:       The Voynich manuscript is an illustrated codex hand-written in an unknown writing system. The vellum in the book pages has been carbon-dated to the early 15th century (1404–1438), and may have been composed in Northern Italy during the Italian Renaissance.   The manuscript is named after Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish book dealer who purchased it in 1912.   The pages of the codex are vellum. Some of the pages are missing, but about 240 remain. The text is written from left to right, and most of the pages have illustrations or diagrams.  The Voynich manuscript has been studied by many professional and amateur cryptographers, including American and British codebreakers from both World War I and World War II.  No one has yet succeeded in deciphering the text, and it has become a famous case in the history of cryptography. The mystery of the meaning and origin of the manuscript has excited the popular imagination, making the manuscript the subject of novels and speculation. None of the many hypotheses proposed over the last hundred years has yet been independently verified.  Many people have speculated that the writing might be nonsense.

Solving_A858,2jhtve,TheUSAsian,3,Fri Oct 17 18:35:05 2014 UTC,He concludes A858 is a psychopath and cites a pop science book and his knowledge. It is an interesting idea but far from a proof - if that's even possible - However psychology is today still largely unscientific and it's totally absurd to brand a person for a psychic disorder because he uses the reddit API to post riddles.  I've been hooked on the data for a few days and there are some points that point more to a bored and skilled programmer than everything else. For one the wiki page: https://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/wiki/theories   I think advocating psychopathy as an explanation for the data on the subreddit explains more about the OP than A858.   It's probably possible - however there are a lot of other explanations that are equally likely. OP did nothing to convince us expect quoting an interesting excerpt from a book.
Solving_A858,2jhtve,dirtmcgurk,3,Fri Oct 17 21:00:36 2014 UTC,"I'm interested in and have studied psychology. I was thinking about making a post that broke down a decision tree for the intent of the poster, and expanded on the idea that the posts are solvable puzzles; in the absence of any real indications of what the posts are, it is the only path that is inherently interesting and worth investigating, as approaching them as solvable puzzles could reveal their true nature (if it was a dump or instruction set of some sort etc) or eventually have it declared rubbish.  I woke up excited to share my insight and ideas only to find this post. Psychology is a wonderful field full of great data and analysis backed up experimentally and peer reviewed. It has great value when included as a frame of reference when solving problems in almost every field involving human action. Posts like this are the worst examples of lazy armchair psychology, and really get under my skin.  What do I think it is? Some posts are legitimate puzzles that have been solved. Maybe it started as something else, but at least some of the posts have been made as a kind of game. OP obviously didn't read the FAQ. Maybe some are unsolvable on purpose, but I think that's less likely than being either used for personal utility (a dump, instruction set, code) or for crypto fun.   Assuming the .NET snippet containing his username is at all significant, it would be fun to interpret it as a metaphor for solving crypto. You take in a string, return a string, and compare the resulting string to your expectations. This is just as baseless as the OP, but I admit it.  Given the increasing difficulty of the puzzles, I see no reason to believe this latest series of posts is complete rubbish. The future and some crunching time will tell (or not!). I'm currently playing with XOR comparisons in case it's some kind of block cypher. Just a shot in the dark and a chance to code some simple tools to check it out. :)"
Solving_A858,2jhtve,dirtmcgurk,2,Sat Oct 18 06:07:34 2014 UTC,"It's likely compressed or encrypted... I've converted some of the hex data to binary and ran some statistical tests over them (basically using the Linux tools xxd and ent):   Some examples (all of yesterdays had similiar data):   hex is the data copy and pasted into a text file:  $ xxd -r -p hex bin $ ent bin Entropy = 7.867608 bits per byte.  Optimum compression would reduce the size of this 1416 byte file by 1 percent.  Chi square distribution for 1416 samples is 248.00, and randomly would exceed this value 50.00 percent of the times.  Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 125.1744 (127.5 = random). Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.169491525 (error 0.89 percent). Serial correlation coefficient is -0.001389 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).   So it's pretty random. I've compared the X2 values to compressed and encrypted data and it's more likely encrypted.   I've experimented with diffs betweens postings that might give a clue about the nature of the posts. I've compared random binary data for diffs and the diffs here are somewhat different. This might be a clue.   Here are 2 images to show what I mean: (data converted back from binary using xxd bin out.hex:   notice the same data at the beginning on the lines: https://i.imgur.com/7hQutkL.png -   Random data from /dev/urandom for comparision:   https://i.imgur.com/sN6xYXD.png  This may be a false direction...   However here some statistics for other data:   [~]$ ent random.bin                                                                                       Entropy = 7.889569 bits per byte.  Optimum compression would reduce the size of this 1500 byte file by 1 percent.  Chi square distribution for 1500 samples is 220.32, and randomly would exceed this value 90.00 percent of the times.  Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 124.8087 (127.5 = random). Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.120000000 (error 0.69 percent). Serial correlation coefficient is 0.018757 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).  $ ent aes.bin Entropy = 7.999288 bits per byte.  Optimum compression would reduce the size of this 238512 byte file by 0 percent.  Chi square distribution for 238512 samples is 234.95, and randomly would exceed this value 75.00 percent of the times.  Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5545 (127.5 = random). Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.148420205 (error 0.22 percent). Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000765 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).   So I don't have the knowledge to much further than this but it looks like it's somehow encrypted and enriched with other data... X2 values are similiar for all of the riddle data... I'm not sure about the diffs - I think they are significant but I can't really tell if it's just random stuff... A858 also linked an ISO paper with encryption algorithms... I've yet to check the data if it matches some of them but that's not easy or not at all to tell.   I decided to leave it there... don't have the time"

The term GUID typically refers to various implementations of the universally unique identifier (UUID) standard.   GUIDs are usually stored as 128-bit values, and are commonly displayed as 32 hexadecimal digits with groups separated by hyphens, such as {21EC2020-3AEA-4069-A2DD-08002B30309D}. They may or may not be generated from random (or pseudo-random) numbers. GUIDs generated from random numbers normally contain 6 fixed bits (these indicate that the GUID is random) and 122 random bits; the total number of unique such GUIDs is 2122 (approximately 5.3×1036). This number is so large that the probability of the same number being generated randomly twice is negligible; however other GUID versions have different uniqueness properties and probabilities, ranging from guaranteed uniqueness to likely duplicates. Assuming uniform probability for simplicity, the probability of one duplicate would be about 50% if every person on earth as of 2014 owned 600 million GUIDs.

I've had to reverse engineer this sort of crap before, so here's what I'd look into if I were being paid to do it:  1) Get the full data set (scrape the archive) and run every file through the app I wrote 2) Try to spot inconsistencies, if there were some sort of secret message here (I'm convinced there isn't), then the majority of the GUID files could be white noise, and inconsistent files could be the true message. Of particular interest are any non-GUIDs buried in the files. 3) Many files end with a partial GUID, which suggests they're part of a sequence, so find the sequence by finding out how the partials relate to one another 4) The format changes several times throughout the posts. It's always GUIDs, and they're usually separated by spaces, but sometimes they're separated by \r\n, sometimes there's no separation, sometimes they're 36-char hyphenated-format GUIDs and sometimes they're 32-char N-format GUIDs. This suggests it's either several systems or applications posting the data with no clearly defined protocol, or a human manually posting them and making the format up as they go along. 5) GUIDs are ""Globally Unique"" for a reason: V4 GUIDs have virtually no chance of conflicting with one another. Look for GUIDs which repeat, because it means they're there on purpose. If you find GUIDs that repeat, then this is probably a C&C server sending commands. 6) The post titles have repeating patterns. Posts come once every 3 hours, or four hours, and sometimes there's a break and then the pattern continues. The patterns go all around the clock and are usually exactly on time, suggesting it's automated. The breaks and odd times (e.g. posting every 4 hours on the 59th minute of the hour) suggests the server sending these messages is being restarted occasionally.  This limits the number of potential applications it could be: it can't be something that has a required 24hr service, such as a banking system. 7) In the earlier posts back in 2012, there was no pattern to the posts. Their post times had no relationship, and the format of the post changed a lot. This suggests it was previously a manually-run service.    This is all just off the top of my head, so it'd require proper analysis work to figure out what's going on."

If they were GUIDs, they'd have to have been made at some point, and the application that made them would almost certainly have conformed to the UUID specification. This makes it really unlikely that they're GUIDs.     Yep, totally valid. In another comment I mentioned that the size of the posts, the fact they're on a public site, and the commonality of using GUIDs to address members of a series (e.g. a member of a series of slave applications listening to a C&C server) leads me to believe they're most likely to be GUIDs.  I fully accept that they could also be almost any Hex-encoded data, hashes or GUIDs. It seems most probable to me that they're GUIDs because GUIDs have no inherent, non-numerical meaning without reference to the system which they apply to (thus allowing them to be shared publicly); the posts are too small to contain any binary data I've ever seen in reverse engineering; the posts are posted periodically (roughly once every 3-4 hours) which signifies either a still-alive signal, or a broadcast, but the posts are always ~100kb which seems too small to encode any meaningful text or dataset data, but too large to be a still-alive signal thus suggesting it's not encoded data. It's essentially a crapshoot for what these are, but I'm willing to wager they're either GUIDs or really, really tiny pieces of encoded data. I just can't think what the use would be of encoded data that's this tiny, whereas GUIDs can represent everything from identifiers of database rows to identifiers of slave applications to identifiers of modules within said applications.  The remainders are puzzlers though, and do lend credence to the idea that these aren't GUIDs. I'm happy to debate that idea, but I'd need to see some example of some system which sends around non-GUID data of a similar size on a regular broadcast."

Solving_A858,2jh33e,PM_ME_UR_PERESTROIKA,5,Fri Oct 17 18:05:42 2014 UTC,"By formatting ""properly"", I mean conforming to any notable code formatting style. For example, Microsoft's own coding conventions for C#.  I described your coding style as inconsistent because you've indented some lines, while leaving others without any indentation. Looking at it again, I see now that lines beginning with a keyword or bracket are indented according to what block they're in, but other lines are not indented. So, while it does have some internal consistency to it, formatting the way you did does not aid in readability and in fact hinders it.  Consider lines 45-47. Conventionally, they'd be indented like                  else                     nonGuids.Add(combined);                 splitBySpace = splitBySpace.Skip(guidSplit).ToList();   However, the way you formatted it, lines 46 and 47 are not indented at all. This makes it difficult to tell from a glance that they belong to different blocks, without looking to the else on the line above.  Another factor that makes your code harder to read is that it keeps jumping around to different indentation levels between adjacent lines. This makes it hard to scan the lines and get a feel for the way the code flows.  You should always be diligent to format your code in a readable way. A good text editor can help with this. It doesn't take much time to do, and the returns you and those who read your code will get later on are well worth it. No matter if you're a professional programmer (or planning to become one), or just a hobbyist, good formatting should be something you do every time you code.

I can assure you the code uses indent-per-scope in the source, irrespective of whether the scope is explicit or implicit. Although saying specifically what is wrong with the code is always helpful, because if I actually had screwed up the formatting it'd have been pretty hard to act on ""format it properly"" with no additional pointers, wouldn't it?   Microsoft's GUIDs are an implementation of the UUID standard. The format of a UUID is summarized well in this section of the UUID Wikipedia page. The actual standards documents are linked from that article.   Thanks for that. That makes it considerably less likely that these are GUIDs then, I agree with you. I was thrown by the fact that .NET, Postgresql and MS SQL Server all accepted these GUIDs as valid GUIDs. However, one would assume that if these were GUIDs then they'd have been generated at some point, and would thus conform to the UUID spec.  Good spot, I concede that these are unlikely to be GUIDs and will edit the original post to admit that fact."

MD5 has been utilized in a wide variety of cryptographic applications, and is also commonly used to verify data integrity.  MD5 was designed by Ron Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function, MD4.  The source code in RFC 1321 contains a ""by attribution"" RSA license.  In 1996 a flaw was found in the design of MD5. While it was not deemed a fatal weakness at the time, cryptographers began recommending the use of other algorithms, such as SHA-1—which has since been found to be vulnerable as well.

Solving_A858,2jh33e,Eathed,1 point,Fri Oct 17 10:35:15 2014 UTC,Can you give me a little bit more insight? I'm more of a noob to this text based cryptography than most
Solving_A858,2jh33e,PathlessDemon,4,Fri Oct 17 04:29:03 2014 UTC,"Lets say I want to send the message ""Hello world!"" cryptographically. I could use one or more of the many types of encryptions out there to securely send that message. Maybe I think AES 128 is a good encryption and use that to send it. I put in the text and set the password to ""eathed"". Suddenly I get this text:  JGxrMvnVA+pYWefS4PZDk47oFjl963ZmCuP8XzgfNcDrFPiHyYCP0LNnDXGf1h+hygdzXKFlCer3aNG/yoJzZOaszgSlpTbOLUn1a/tco+w=   I would send this off and the person receiving it would decrypt it with the password. That string looks like it could be base64 so lets go ahead and turn it into text. You would end up with something like this:  $lk2ùÕêXYçÒàöCè9}ëvfãü_85ÀëøÉÐ³gqÖ¡Ês\¡eê÷hÑ¿Êsdæ¬Î¥¥6Î-Iõkû\£ì   This is where the trap comes in. Unfortunately my example doesn't have it, but sometimes when you decode things like that you end up with words showing up in it. These words don't actually mean anything, it's just random data that happened to line up correctly.  A858 appears to be using some form of encryption. Because we are at the receiving end, what we see looks like hex. Converting it through various bases doesn't really provide much insight. If we knew how it was encrypted and what the password was we could get the original message.  Converting it to different bases can be useful sometimes, but generally any time something should be converted the log will pick it up and convert it for us."
Solving_A858,2jh33e,Eathed,2,Fri Oct 17 04:56:16 2014 UTC,"Very interesting, thank you for spinning me up on this!  If it's all based on a chronological encryption, each post given a specified time stamp, and while some of his postings are in hex format, is it possible that they've given us the key in their name instead of a wayward string of code?  I'm probably way behind on the uptake here, but if it's anything like military codings there'd never be a chance that a key would be broadcasted in the same style coding.   Maybe it's a separate hash equality from what the coding is perceived as?"

Solving_A858,2jh33e,nuclearfuture,1 point,Fri Oct 17 05:40:53 2014 UTC,"You're almost right. What you'd see in URLs is data encoded in a modified version of Base64 commonly referred to as Base64URL. It's essentially the same, except '+' and '/' get replaced by '-' and '_' and they drop any '=' padding from the end. Base64 is just another representation of data that's a bit more compact. The Base64URL variant is just because URLs can't handle some characters and it's often useful to embed data encoded in Base64 in the URL.  When you see it at the end of URLs it's part of what's called the Query String. Essentially this boils down to a set of parameters that you're passing to the website as part of the URL. Stuff that you'd see there that would be base64 encoded include things like cookie-like data or signed identity tokens, for example."
Solving_A858,2jh33e,Solari23,1 point,Fri Oct 17 05:44:48 2014 UTC,"Query string:       In the World Wide Web, a query string is the part of a uniform resource locator (URL) containing data that does not fit conveniently into a hierarchical path structure. The query string commonly includes fields added to a base URI by a Web browser or other client application, for example as part of a HTML form.   A web server can handle a Hypertext Transfer Protocol request either by reading a file from its file system based on the URL path or by handling the request using logic that is specific to the type of resource. In the case that special logic is invoked the query string will be available to that logic for use in its processing, along with the path component of the URL.

Solving_A858,2jixhb,ammar_io,1 point,Fri Oct 17 16:44:26 2014 UTC,"Vigenère cipher:       The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.    The Vigenère (French pronunciation: ​[viʒnɛːʁ]) cipher has been reinvented many times. The method was originally described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553 book La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso; however, the scheme was later misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère in the 19th century, and is now widely known as the ""Vigenère cipher"". [citation needed]  Though the cipher is easy to understand and implement, for three centuries it resisted all attempts to break it; this earned it the description le chiffre indéchiffrable (French for 'the indecipherable cipher'). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers.  Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering a Vigenère cipher.    Image i - The Vigenère cipher is named for Blaise de Vigenère (pictured). Although Giovan Battista Bellaso had invented the cipher earlier, Vigenère did invent a stronger autokey cipher.

Response: The client responds with a string created as follows. 1. The challenge is base64-decoded. 2. The decoded challenge is hashed using HMAC-MD5, with a shared secret (typically, the user's password, or a hash thereof) as the secret key. 3. The hashed challenge is converted to a string of lowercase hex digits. 4. The username and a space character are prepended to the hex digits. 5.

It is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.    The Vigenère (French pronunciation: ​[viʒnɛːʁ]) cipher has been reinvented many times. The method was originally described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553 book La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso; however, the scheme was later misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère in the 19th century, and is now widely known as the ""Vigenère cipher"". [citation needed]  Though the cipher is easy to understand and implement, for three centuries it resisted all attempts to break it; this earned it the description le chiffre indéchiffrable (French for 'the indecipherable cipher'). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers.  Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering a Vigenère cipher.    Image i - The Vigenère cipher is named for Blaise de Vigenère (pictured). Although Giovan Battista Bellaso had invented the cipher earlier, Vigenère did invent a stronger autokey cipher.

I still don't understand where you derived the ""DeviceControl4"" portion from (or the ""(Device Control 4)"" you posted on the other page.)  EDIT2: For those looking for it, the original post was here and I don't think we're really onto anything with this, the fact that it converts into an intelligble list of prime numbers (after converting it from hex -> ASCII, and then Hex -> ASCII again), plus the follow up post 201108192334 providing a continuance of the intelligible prime number list makes me think this probably isn't going anywhere."

Solving_A858,285owh,MaximaxII,4,Sun Jun 15 15:56:15 2014 UTC,I'm working on it and I'm planning to post it to /r/dogecoin. I have found several addresses that hold more than $20M in DOGEs. They are not accessible on dogechain nor they're listed in the most richest addresses ever.   One of these have addresses has history of more than $50M in DOGEs received...
Solving_A858,285owh,MaximaxII,6,Sun Jun 15 16:01:02 2014 UTC,"That's really interesting! I’ve been trying to map the transactions out too :  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/276833132/A858.pdf   Some addresses stood out to me:   DQMzuHbdBTmKNj8oR8w14dBcHdcX9bM3hV: a million-doge address that has since been emptied. It has transferred some coins to an address that belonged to whoever the one A858 posted belonged to. DFXSypWyb9TGDcChvpAGXz61pVrHMysFEJ: where some of the doge seems to have been sent. It hasn’t moved from that address over the last 24 hours. DQfTtsAftR3A3amiBZfNeCuq8GfanerU9d: This is a really interesting one. It seemed “human”: the amounts that had been put into it were round (25, 25 and 100), or corresponded to something real (98, the number on Josh Wise’s car, that /r/dogecoin sponsored – it’s since become a pretty common tip).   So last night, I sent 4.0396 doge to that address to see what would happen (it’s A858 in decimal – I also accidentally sent 5.0396). 4 hours after receiving that, whoever the address belongs to decided to empty it.  It was all put into this account and then, 20 minutes later, into these two accounts:    DBtmLKY8RpxjcNNKxeP1dLwyYyGVDvEtoF: hasn’t redeemed the 200 doge yet, but looks “human” as well. DDSB5vw3BicaXwniRJbBe6JuqaX2Vx7YGu: has been emptied as well. Some other addresses were also used to send some doge to DNNwF4yfv6VW7AUMDt96YwvtR19nNnSx1D.   So DNNwF4yfv6VW7AUMDt96YwvtR19nNnSx1D and DBtmLKY8RpxjcNNKxeP1dLwyYyGVDvEtoF are where the trail seems to end. Should I try to send those two 4.0396 doge again?

On very rare occasions, the buzzer signal is interrupted and a voice transmission in Russian takes place.  It has been active since sometime in the late 1970s or early 1980s, when the first reports were made of a station on this frequency.   Its origins have been traced to Russia, but although several theories with varying degrees of plausibility exist, its actual purpose has never been officially confirmed and remains a source of speculation.

I just don't see any comments that may be useful, like how they got readable plain text that some apparently got from the first step.   I don't see many comments, and the comments I do see, are ones like, ""I would have done the same thing, minus the elephants"" and ""I think you missed a letter. Or a number... I dunno.""

If it was as easy as a Caesar cipher, it would have been solved 3 years ago when he started posting.   I figured I would have come across many posts regarding those who have managed to decipher the hex ---> plain text but I don't. I don't see any posts regarding how to complete what you said as ""Step 1"" : getting from Hex ---> Plain text that is readable. If those have gotten that far, I assume there would be an explanation along with it so others could replicate and verify but I don't.  I created this topic so I could ask the mods if there was an IRC channel. There is one but I popped in and they said they don't work on A858 much. They seem to be focusing on Exingulis data and aren't interested in A858. I don't blame them, splitting your time between two sets of data is ineffecient. I won't be spending time in there because there is no reason to if they are working on Exingulis, it would be confusing and wouldn't help anyone out.  They don't have an IRC for A858 specifically.

You mention things like morse code, how is it relevant?   You're claiming it can be solved by using nothing but a hex to ASCII converter.How did you come to this conclusion? What have you solved?   You are saying that some of them are encrypted using AES or DES. And then proceed to claim that you somehow have the keys? How did you obtain the key? There are no known AES vulnerabilities. DES encryptions can only be broken through bruteforcing. But according to you it's as simple as adding the first 32 bits and last 16 bits of a message?? And not any message either, but the encrypted message... It's interesting considering AES keys are 128 bits long and DES keys are 56 bits long. Furthermore you are also assuming that A858 uses old and broken algorithms such as DES.   The fact is, assuming AES is being used, you cannot find the keys at all. But since you claim you somehow have done that, I suspect you may get famous very soon.   You seem to be able to identify encryption algorithms just by looking at the hex encoded blocks. The encrypted data from most encryption algorithms are designed to be uniform and ""random"". What methods are you using to identify them?   You do a lot of things without explaining what you do. You jump from one step to another, magically obtaining values that no one seems to be able to reproduce.   You make strange claims such as    6 up 9 is listening on one frequency and transmitting on another.   Googling ""6 up 9"", ""six up nine"" and similar brings up nothing.

Solving_A858,27anje,swebonny,3,Wed Jun 4 20:37:50 2014 UTC,"The reasoning why I said it looked like AES or DES is because his hex values can be decoded using a few methods found in AES, to be more specific AES's process of stream ciphering and block ciphers to generate new values. He also uses ROT13 cipher: because the hex values I got after doing OFB block ciphering used in the AES algorithm with the associated key stream were shifted -3 and + 3 every other line. In every post, have multiples of 3. I used 3 as the shift-3 key for ROT13. After that it was easy xors and shifting each 3rd hex value to the left two places.   This sounds great! Please link to the post that you successfully decoded and then describe the sequence of steps you went through to reach this conclusion.  Like you've just done in the text I've quoted. Just list it as a sequence of steps that we can repeat to confirm your claims. If it's a cipher that's been modified in some way that's fine; I'm a programmer and I can write the code if necessary.  This is literally all I'm asking for.   Even my professors didn't ask for the type of clarification you guys want. You guys want to do cryptoanalysis stuff?

A858 has actually posted references to encryption standards in the past. I don't see why you think he would invent his own cipher. He's used plenty of common encoding schemes and algorithms - base64, MD5 etc.   I think my username is appropriate for most of you who are wasting your time trying to figure it out and especially appropriate for those who claim they are have went to college and studied encryption algorithms.  It's quite obvious when someone replies back complaining that technical phrases are used.   I was not ""complaining that technical phrases are used"". I was complaining that you are just throwing around a bunch of technical phrases without explaining how they're relevant or used. It's kind of like on Star Trek when they throw around ""technobabble"" to sound ""sciency"". That's how your posts read. You throw around crypto terms like ""block cipher"" but don't explain which block cipher, how you used it, etc.   At a minimum, at least I contributed where many of the people throwing a hissy fit are simply a waste of space.   You've yet to demonstrate that you have even contributed anything to this effort. That's the point.   I refuse to do a full out explanation with diagrams, videos and pictures. I refuse to educate those with no knowledge here pissing and moaning about using technical phrases. It's not my job to teach you how all this stuff works nor is it my job to spend hours making it easily readable for a first grader.   And nobody is asking you to. But it's interesting that after I make just the most simple, basic request - give an explanation that makes sense, that others who are technically proficient can follow and substantiate - you cry that that's somehow foul and unfair. You're distracting from the central point here, the reason why I created this thread in the first place: you haven't explained anything, and nothing you've posted makes any coherent sense."

It can be trivially shown that the bytes from the posts are statistically uniform (the auto-analysis script I wrote does this) - ie. it's randomly distributed.  When you translate from ANSI encoding to Unicode you're getting random Unicode characters. Chinese characters are statistically the most likely characters you'll get because there are a lot of them. When you ""translate"" from Chinese to English you'll get random English words because Chinese characters tend to represent words.  You can trivially confirm this by generating some random data yourself (eg. head -c 1024 /dev/urandom > file.txt) and running it through the same process.

It's easy to read into noise and think you see a pattern.  Again I say to you: generate some random data yourself and run it through the same process. See what results you get.  If you want to be extra honest with yourself, get an A858 post, generate some random data of the same length, mix them up so you don't know which is which, then decode them both using the same techniques and see if you can figure out which was the A858 post, from the ""words that stick out"".

Gibson coined the term ""cyberspace"" in his short story ""Burning Chrome"" (1982) and later popularized the concept in his debut novel, Neuromancer (1984). In envisaging cyberspace, Gibson created an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s.  He is also credited with predicting the rise of reality television and with establishing the conceptual foundations for the rapid growth of virtual environments such as video games and the World Wide Web.

History of article  Artificial neural network:       Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts  (1943) created a computational model for neural networks based on mathematics and algorithms. They called this model threshold logic. The model paved the way for neural network research to split into two distinct approaches. One approach focused on biological processes in the brain and the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence.  In the late 1940s psychologist Donald Hebb  created a hypothesis of learning based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that is now known as Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning is considered to be a 'typical' unsupervised learning rule and its later variants were early models for long term potentiation. These ideas started being applied to computational models in 1948 with Turing's B-type machines.  Farley and Wesley A. Clark  (1954) first used computational machines, then called calculators, to simulate a Hebbian network at MIT. Other neural network computational machines were created by Rochester, Holland, Habit, and Duda  (1956).

I did initially think that perhaps they were encrypted weights for a bot, but there's too few (even the simple ANNs I work with have like, double the amount of weights here). They could be delta-weights (only the weights that are changed), but the nature of most training algorithms effectively changes all the weights, so that can't be it... How about GA-trained ANNs? That way only mutations need be transmitted. That's possible, though the population must be pretty small.  I still think about it, but what we have been able to decrypt doesn't conform with this. For starters, ANNs are almost universally awful at natural language processing (and yet ""How can I train my neural network on text samples?"" is still one of the most frequent questions we get over at /r/MachineLearning, guh -_-), so that kinda kills that hypothesis."

Neural network mixing of article  PAQ:       Beginning with PAQ7, each model outputs a prediction (instead of a pair of counts). These predictions are averaged in the logistic domain:   xi = stretch(Pi(1)) P(1) = squash(Σi wi xi)   where P(1) is the probability that the next bit will be a 1, Pi(1) is the probability estimated by the i'th model, and   stretch(x) = ln(x / (1 - x)) squash(x) = 1 / (1 + e-x) (inverse of stretch).   After each prediction, the model is updated by adjusting the weights to minimize coding cost.   wi ← wi + η xi (y - P(1))   where η is the learning rate (typically 0.002 to 0.01), y is the predicted bit, and (y - P(1)) is the prediction error. The weight update algorithm differs from backpropagation in that the terms P(1)P(0) are dropped. This is because the goal of the neural network is to minimize coding cost, not root mean square error.  Most versions of PAQ use a small context to select among sets of weights for the neural network. Some versions use multiple networks whose outputs are combined with one more network prior to the SSE stages. Furthermore, for each input prediction there may be several inputs which are nonlinear functions of Pi(1) in addition to stretch(P(1))     Interesting: Parya language | AN/PAQ-1 | Position analysis questionnaire | Context mixing   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

We have to be thinking huuuuuge picture to figure stuff like this out.  Go look at the unsolved cipher in Kryptos. Then go look at it as a picture. Seeing as it was made by an artist and the first 3 were all 100% code, you can assume that there has to be art in there somewhere. Well the third one is a picture ""what do you see x?"". You see Carter breaking into the tomb, and going up the steps of the tomb. That is where they open the casket. And the super script YAR with the HEAD rising up. And TUT behind the folded up LOTUS. Kryptos says that King Tut was risen from the dead in 1922/1923 when they broke the curse by entering the tomb. Thus explaining the unexplained fractures on Tut's skull and back. Because Carter was terrified and had to ""kill"" the mummy.  Then there is also the EYE of Horus in the tomb. Germany (thus the newest hint BERLIN) took the eye. This explains the (so called unexplained) hyper inflation Germany experienced in 1923, that was funded solely by private investment organizations and thus the Great Depression.   This would mean that there is a select group of people in the world who know that because Tut was risen from the dead, that everything the Egyptians religions say is true. Which means the world is not as they have been letting on.   Further research and messages hidden in plain view (Call of Duty Nazi Zombies, Montauk Project, Philidelphia Experiment, messages in Marvel Comics) are all true and hidden right in front of our eyes. But those 13 people (note the 12 steps with Tut at the top in Kryptos if you look at the last one as a picture) are engineering the world to think otherwise so they can control it.   WW2 was actually about time travel. If time travel is real and already exists it is playing a bigger part in our world than the intelligence agencies will let on.

Solving_A858,26ycne,lowey2002,1 point,Sat May 31 14:22:37 2014 UTC,"There are databases with words and their respective hashes, if you find your hash in the database you have the password (unless collision)."
Solving_A858,26ycne,EvenEveryNameWasTake,1 point,Mon Jun 2 17:47:54 2014 UTC,"True, but brute forcing or dictionary matching a hash doesn't guarantee you have the original message and it is an exceptionally expensive process  (in terms of processing time).  Hashing is a destructive, one way process so my argument is that if A858 is an MD5 it is pointless, a dump of hex values with meaning only at the moment of output."
Solving_A858,26ycne,lowey2002,1 point,Tue Jun 3 10:09:52 2014 UTC,"Database matching will pretty much always give you the original message if the message consisted of actual words.

Solving_A858,26ycne,EvenEveryNameWasTake,1 point,Tue Jun 3 13:38:06 2014 UTC,"Database matching will pretty much always give you the original message   No it won't.  You are hashing a variable length message into 128 bits of information, meaning you are guaranteed to have collisions at some point. This isn't an issue when dictionary matching password hashes but it is a problem if you are trying to reconstruct a message. You cannot programatically guarantee you have the correct result."

Solving_A858,26ycne,EvenEveryNameWasTake,3,Wed Jun 4 11:45:03 2014 UTC,MD5 is highly unlikely and practically useless if used in such a way. Most likely it is something encrypted in hexadecimal.
Solving_A858,26ycne,Prototypexx,3,Sat May 31 23:24:14 2014 UTC,MD5 is fatally flawed. Has been for years. It's considered not secure.  It's in the summary
Solving_A858,26ycne,fragglet,1 point,Sat May 31 13:39:09 2014 UTC,"It's plausible, but impossible to prove or disprove. With the exception of the Reddit Gold response, nobody has ever shown an example of an MD5 hash that has appeared in A858's main posts.  A858's posts consist of 128-bit groups (usually with a terminating 64-bit group). MD5 digests are also 128-bit groups. Apart from the fact that they're the same length, there's no reason to think that they're MD5 digests."

Apart from A01, A02 and A03 uses MD5, while A04 uses SHA1. In all of these encryptions, both the encrypted message as well as the key are present.   A04 works by adding 2 ASCII letters/numbers in front of the key and convert in into SHA1. You then take the last 20 letters of the converted SHA1 and compare it to the message. If there's a match, both ASCII letters/numbers will be part of the decrypted message.  I feel that they will be using similar techniques from A04 for A05.

Solving_A858,24wj2j,SatanIsSanta,3,Tue May 6 22:35:14 2014 UTC,"To decode the posts that are in Hex I use: http://www.yellowpipe.com/yis/tools/encrypter/index.php and choose HEX to Ascii. The problem is is that more often then not the ascii text is just random characters which means its likely encrypted. To decrypt something we need a key, the only problem is, none of us here know what they key is. I'm sure subtle hints have been left and little clues but at the moment we have no idea. We don't know for sure if the majority of the posts are actually encrypted data / messages or if it is just random hex characters. In A858's post yesterday: http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9/comments/24tmeo/201405052029/  he posted a lot of characters that did not fit the standard format, so we knew something was different, decoding the characters by taking all the hex and converting it to ascii and then taking that output and converting it to ascii from hex again gave us a base64 encoded string. We decoded that with the same website but selecting base64_decode gave us this cryptic word search that has, as far as we know, now been completed: http://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/comments/24wdm5/a858s_special_message_decoded/ and also another solution, which means there might be things we are still missing: http://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/comments/24tqdn/new_here_a858s_latest_post_was_semieasy_to_decode/ (Top comment) This didn't mean to come across as condescending btw!"

Solving_A858,24wj2j,That_steam_guy,1 point,Sun May 18 20:18:21 2014 UTC,"Well, the first thing I always do is convert the initial text from hex to ascii since the posts are in hex. When you convert a random unbroken 858 post we get something meaningless in ascii like ""e2a3d1d288151b4408824bfc35f0d65e"" - > ""â£ÑÒˆD‚Kü5ðÖ"". (This was using HEX to ASCII) this means that the post is probably encrypted.  However when 858 posted this: http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9/comments/24tmeo/201405052029/  It didn't fit the format, so the first thing you would do would be try a hex to ascii: ""3444343434353739 3444374135313331"" - > ""4D4445794D7A5131""  We can see that the converted string doesn't resemble random ascii like ""â£ÑÒˆD‚Kü5ðÖ"", but looks a lot more ordered. In fact it looks exactly like HEX. So we just try another hex to ascii: ""4D4445794D7A5131"" -> ""MDEyMzQ1"" (obviously I'm only doing this with a tiny segment and not the whole text but you would of course convert it all)  ""MDEyMzQ1"" Looks just like the sort of output you get when you convert something to base64 from ascii and it doesn't look like HEX which has the format of number 0-9 and letters A-F. We can see straight away that if numbers like M and Z and Q are involved we are dealing with something different. So the next step is to convert ""MDEyMzQ1"" from base64 to ascii -> ""012345"" We can tell that this is the final message when converting all the text. So you basically try and convert based on what it looks like so if the text looks like hex convert from hex to ascii (plaintext) and if the converted text still looks like Hex then convert it again... I hope that ramble made sense, comment any questions!"

IF the ""members"" can still access it, why not just make it private in the first place?  And lastly, how many of the posts and combined in the pastebin link?

For example, the names we see in that post would perhaps be approved submitters on the subreddit. But there could be perhaps dozens of non-approved submitters who still must see that information (and possess decryptors) and the convenience of Reddit makes that simple.

Some people seem to have delved further into this, but some only scratch the surface like me. It seems like many users here know more than they show. I've only recently discovered that there had been so much progress. I find it to be very interesting."
Solving_A858,24s03t,SilentSongs,19,Mon May 5 23:22:07 2014 UTC,"A01 was the first encryption to show up. They would post a message with the key attached. Their subreddit name uses A01. It's fairly basic, it just tells you what keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard to press. For instance if I wanted to write ""hello"" in A01, I would figure out which column on the keyboard the ""h"" is, and then the row. The column is the message, the row is the key. ""h"" is 6-2. ""e"" is 3-1. All of ""hello"" is 63999-21221.  A02 is a bit more complicated, but it's not too bad. An A02 post is actually a list of MD5 hashes. This is impossible to crack, but Monocle wrote us a script to decode them. They start with a letter, then 3 random numbers between 100 and 999, and they all end with 175. When you get the first character from each decoded hash, you get the message.  A03 also uses MD5, but the message is also the key. The first 4 characters of the message are the key to the second set of 4 characters. The second set is the key to the third, and so on. We of course wouldn't know what the key for the first four is though, so we just brute forced it. It ended up being ""aaaa"".  I don't know a huge amount about A04, I haven't spent as much time looking at it. The posts use both MD5 and SHA1. When A04 was starting to get posted, QR codes were also posted. The QR code contained the key for that post. As time went on they gave up on QR codes and just posted the key in the title of the message.  I haven't been keeping up a whole lot since A05 started. I work almost every day, so I just haven't had time. AFAIK not much is known about A05/how to decrypt it. Ask around in /r/Solving_32865 to see if they have information on it.  If you have any other questions let me know or send us a message here."

It looks like a constructed language, though, in the lines of Interlingua, which has with more Romance roots with a less strict grammar, but still not it.  My bet is on a constructed language based around some core vocabulary in Latin. They are not fluent since they seem to throw in out of context declinations. For the rest they seem to be relying on some sort of vernacular French with phonetic and SMS spelling adding some English here and there when in need for some particular tech jargon.   It should be noted that they use some pretty formal language when addressing each other. It sounds creepy, but it adds to the kind of circlejerk like language we see these days."

There is no specific limitation of what an AI can do, it's simply down to its programming and its goal. If its programming allows it to create code, and it well written enough to produce working code, and its goal is to turn the internet into an AI, it'll do it. Problem is, the writing of such an AI would be ridiculously hard, complicated, it would require hardware that is impractical, and not to mention the goal of writing itself into parts of the internet or absorbing parts of the internet would be preposterous in of itself.

It would have to be a serious coincidence for all of the posts to be blanked to ""00000..."" that one time.   Pah. This whole thing is strange. Since the subreddit dies every time it gets publicity, it's hard to get enough traction behind grounding these ideas. My $0.02? If this isn't a hoax, then we need to look at only the change. The titles are clearly dates (2014 05 01 0229 => May 1st, 2014, 2:29 AM), HOWEVER, if it's the only thing we can understand out of this mess, then we might as well test it against everything.  What filetype would this use, though? And how is it encrypted, if applicable?  Clearly, we can nail this down. The average ""file size"" is small enough that it can fit as plain text in a reddit post. Heavily compressed pictures(Which HAVE been used, and were massive to behold) or soundfiles maybe, but it's most likely text.  Now, why are there deviations in the ""file size""? Compression? Hashing, compressing, and then hashing again?  Improbable.. The ones we've decoded, at least from what I've seen, have not been encrypted in any real sense.  So what kind of data would travel through this? Hourly updates are all that exist, so the best assumption is that it's run by a bot most of the time.  Perhaps most of the posts are noise, and the few that we can read are things stored on the server. Like a heartbeat. This is baffling to me."

If the hints themselves are ciphered, how are you supposed to solve them without knowing the cipher first, hum? If it is an recruitment operation I suspect the solvers are bribed into not ratting out the operation. Besides, it's hex, it could be anything, it could be any length and the possible message could be behind any possible cipher, cryptography and steganography and any combination whatsoever. What I agree is that Cicada 3301 has similar very obscure puzzles. To run an operation like clockwork for 3 years takes dedication.

A bot is a redditor in the form of a program running on a computer focused on certain aspects of what's happening on reddit. When it notices something it's programmed to respond to, it will then do what it's programmed to do.  Every bot must have a username and password to use reddit exactly like a regular person. He can use the reddit API instead of the reddit user interface, though. Consider that reddit is fun, reddit now, baconreader and every other application that let you use reddit outside reddit.com needs to use the reddit API.  That said, in the past someone theorized that A858 was a bot. Now, a bot is limited in opening threads (not comments, threads!) on reddit while it is not limited when it posts in its own subreddit. A858 can in fact be a bot sometimes controlled by a human being. Right /u/A858StatsBot?  EDIT: you can also look at the source code of the bot and see that there's nothing mysterious about it!"

Solving_A858,1z2g1i,vollerkreis,2,Thu Feb 27 13:20:11 2014 UTC,That would be my guess.
Solving_A858,1z2g1i,vollerkreis,8,Wed Mar 5 06:58:52 2014 UTC,"I just found this subreddit literally an hour ago. it is impossible to determine the hash encryption method because all hash encryption's create similar seemingly random information. This leaves me believing that this isn't anything hash, but instead binary.   VDHL code is entirely based on bolean algebra and uses large numerical values that are then decoded into text made from binary representation of letters. This is very summarized. My point is because the username is 16 characters, each post consists of 32 character long sets in groups of 3, that are posted with odd values means that this is absolutely a mathematical representation of binary code.   The username is the key, while we haven't found the pattern yet, A858DE45F56D9BC9 is telling us how to identify the beginning and end of grouped values that are the decodable information.   We can infer a few things about the ""entire message"", as in what all of the posts are saying. It is in English, while some have found a possible correlation to Chinese language structure, it ignores the greater fact that this is being submitted to a English website. This is neither random nor insignificant. For it to be in any other language would make it as impossible to solve as if it were a hash encryption. The patterns would be meaningless to anyone reading it as there are too many plausible false-values.   So now we begin with the bigger and more important challenge; identify the begging and end of the entire message. How many posts are made before it repeats. When we can identify that, then we can examine it as both individual data sets and as a single data set.   If this is the work of a individual/group it's very likely that each post is a meaningful in that each post could potentially be decoded and each have a unique message.   If this is the work of what some have claimed to be governments seeking cryptographers, then we would most likely have to look at it from a meta-data perspective. Where an individual post is meaningless but the collective posts made from the beginning and end of the message is more coherent. The fact that there have been occasional posts with only 3 32-character sets or the last line consists of only 2 32-character sets may be a hint towards the fact the in order to decode this it must be examined in it's entirety.   While there are many possible ways the ""message"" could be being represented, the answer will be simple and is most certainly right in front of us.  The most important fact to recognize is I can be entirely wrong about all of my current conclusions."
Solving_A858,1z2g1i,Alex549us3,5,Sat Mar 29 01:57:20 2014 UTC,"right after I submitted this I realized something about the formatting of the posts. They are a uniform grid.  32 rows with 32 characters in each (for the most part), with never more than 3 columns.  Exactly like a Bolean algebra function matrix. Input -> function = value. I'm very far from identifying it but I think I have a way to start.   So we must ask ourselves what does A858DE45F56D9BC9 tell us about what represents 0, 1, and denotations.   on a very far stretch Old Norse is the only language with 16 letters, not very likely, but not to be entirely forgotten as possibly valuable."

A decent encryption, AES-128+, RSA-2048+, etc. are unbreakable even with the fastest super computers on the planet. Even more so with our measly home machines.   It's very clear at this point that A858 does not want to be figured out, and probably will never be figured out. There is a likelyhood A858 is a government or personal entity who is sharing information in a secret open way with a specific individual or group who has the keys to decrypt it. The coolest outcome is it's a secret agent who is dumping information, the most probable is it's some sort of weather tower or home science project transmitting data.    It's very easy to use Reddit with bots, and probably A858 is just a data dumping bot.    I'm sorry guys. This isn't some mystery with a grand ending.

Solving_A858,1sf9nt,twtCharlie,3,Mon Dec 9 04:34:43 2013 UTC,"There could be this possibility. Rather than a botnet command and control center, it serves as a dumping ground for bots. This mainly due to the fact that it spews out information at a regular interval. It doesn't seem necessary for a CnC server to send out commands at a regular interval, you need very few commands to control a botnet. I set one up for a computer security seminar at my university, and I could get bots to dump information in just 1 click.   That's why I think it's more possible that it looks like this:   The bots sends info to a specific computer that is logged in to A858, this computer dumps it all in the A858 sub-reddit at regular intervals. Now the owner/renter of this botnet can simply visit the subreddit, from any computer around the world and view the information, assuming that the person hold the encryption key.    It's just guesses of course. Still very interesting. But I think we're far away from actually solving A858, all we can do is guess."

If A858 is using AES encryption, it can't really be broken without brute force.  The best computers in the world would take millions of years to crack it.    Building a cluster is really cool, and I'd say go for it.  Just don't expect anything incredible in the end.  Clusters do not just get faster, latencies between networks becomes a large speed sink.  Thus clusters are really good at solving really specific problems that can be split up.  I really doubt you have any such problems for it to solve.    That being said, I wish you the best of luck!"

If we focus on just the minutes of the time (seeing that the hours will always just be decrements of 3) could it be possible that the ones with like digits are related?   If there's any relationship, it's probably the start/stop intervals. So if A858 posts every three hours for two days, then those might all be related. For example, the last post was 22 hours ago.  Also, there have been 2 posts in /r/A858DE45 since posting in the main reddit stopped.   V's with A's makes it a translatable base64 code, it got me wondering how many of his/her other posts could be encrypted the same way.   Well, no other post has had a V in it (AFAIK), so any type of substitution cipher is unlikely.  Really the post title appears to be the date/time of the post with some offset.

Several times there has been interest in the phenomenon (both from within reddit and externally from other websites), and it almost always leads to the A858 subreddit going private, or all the posts being deleted, or similar. After the interest dies down it returns.   Keeping this subreddit private meant that we were able to watch and comment without disturbing whoever is posting. But we've now reached a point where most of the posts look like they're probably automated, and keeping it private limits the number of people we can attract to the cause.  There are certain things that were not widely known outside of this subreddit until now. Firstly we have an auto-analysis system that fetches and performs some simple analysis on A858 posts.

Solving_A858,15j9ar,fragglet,1 point,Sun Dec 30 11:49:07 2012 UTC,"So in terms of the recent posts (past ~6 months), here's what we know:   The data in the posts is randomly distributed, implying it's encrypted, compressed or simply random data. Each post follows a pattern in terms of its length: the number of bytes is always a multiple of 32 bytes, plus an 8 byte tail (32n + 8). 32 bytes implies it could be a block cipher of some kind, but there don't seem to be many 256-bit block ciphers in common use. The 8 byte tail could be a key or IV of some kind; lots of the messages seem reuse the same tail value, though sometimes it's just random.   In terms of the older posts, here are the most interesting things to look at:   The last post of the GIF file posts was never decoded. The third post contained a link to a standard for encryption algorithms, and the fourth post contained a link to an earlier message. This message might have been encrypted using one of those algorithms, but we never worked it out. It would be really interesting to find out. The prime number posts contained tables of prime numbers, but we never figured those out."

You can't always easily link that to a person. Getting a name or Reddit account name would be more useful, but far more difficult.

Wikileaks got their start by setting up an exit node (last hop in the onion, last layer of encryption comes off) and sniffing it for spies and diplomats sending stuff without using SSL with the server.

However, I think it's very important to note that in almost every post the distribution of hex characters is almost perfectly even. That is, there are just as many 0s as there are 8s as there are Fs.  As it has been stated, this is referred to as high entropy. This implies two things: 1) we are seeing cipher text, created by a strong, modern encryption algorithm, or 2) we are seeing near-random text generated by a good, modern psuedo-random generator.  In either case, nothing posted (in typical form as notated by fragglet's tool) will be unencoded into anything meaningful.  I think effort should be focused on attempting to decrypt these messages, instead of trying to simply unencode them to ASCII or Unicode.  fragglet was successful at unencoding a few messages, but those messages did not have high entropy among the characters. Those messages were placed deliberately to be unencoded.  As has been argued, this was done either because A858 is a troll in general, or because A858 was teasing the readers, or because A858 was misdirecting by placing easy-to-unencode data among the real encrypted data (my theory.)

Nowadays the most common scheme is UTF-8 which allows the millions of symbols in the Unicode set to be encoded in a way that's backwards compatible with standard ASCII. But sometimes encoding schemes get mixed up and accidentally turned into gibberish."

The Reddit Gold method would work well, assuming he would click it. It's easy to make/find a simple PHP script that saves Internet info about the connecting person. Someone could put the code in the index of a website and log the data, we could use a basic host for this, but he may not click it because it would look sketchy."

(that is if the user is doing something ""bad"")  The user seems to be deleting posts after one month (bad for us because we cant work our way through all of the posts [i had a theory that the user was encrypting it in more and more complicated ways, or using the content of the last message as the seed for the new one.])"
