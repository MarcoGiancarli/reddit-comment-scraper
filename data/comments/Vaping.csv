You could stop vaping entirely if you really wanted to, or take a break so you forget what the flavors taste like. As long as you feel like you wouldn't want to smoke cigarettes again then vaping has accomplished it's job."
Vaping,3e2vz3,0kgreat,10,Tue Jul 21 15:53:51 2015 UTC,"You could stop entirely if you wanted to, or take a little break from it. :) You could also try some different stuff out-- a new coil build, a different mod, new flavours or get into DIY.   What matters is that you were successful in quitting smoking. If you've moved past it entirely then I think that's pretty cool too. :)"

Vaping,3e2vz3,lenolalatte,2,Tue Jul 21 19:08:27 2015 UTC,Well to be honest the only reason I don't get bored of them is because for one I vape A Lot of other juices and for two I vape a lot of different cereal juices so they don't ever really get boring. Although this one pebbles juice I used to chain vape I can't vape it anymore because I didn't do it in moderation lol.

I'll have to try the one you mentioned"

I kept seeing it on instagram and just couldn't stop thinking about it. Took me awhile to find it to buy it but once I did I bought some and it was love at first taste!
Vaping,3e2vz3,jesus0nadinosaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:42 2015 UTC,I'm checking out bx and gonna get the sample pack. How is the pope juice though? Their site seems a little lacking in description but at under 15$ a 30ml I'm suuuuper tempted
Vaping,3e2vz3,FostralianManifesto,0,Tue Jul 21 20:07:06 2015 UTC,I'm vaping the bx horchatatas right now and it's amazing. The pope juice is amazing too. I just get the 150ml or I run our too fast lol.
Vaping,3e2vz3,jesus0nadinosaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:06 2015 UTC,Of which one? Or both? How is the pope juice different then ohm sweet ohm
Vaping,3e2vz3,FostralianManifesto,0,Tue Jul 21 21:14:44 2015 UTC,Pope juixe is what I got in 150ml. And I would have gotten a 150ml if the horchatatas soo if I could have afforded it. Had 19 bucks left and that how much the 50ml was so I got that and it's half gone already haha.  The juicey ohm's is a bit sweeter and a tiny bit better all all round but the pope juice is very VERY similar it taste. They are both fruit loops juices but the juicey ohm's is more fruity without the milk. It leaves the most wonderful taste in your mouth.

There are hundreds, maybe thousands of flavorings to try. Then get into mixing them in the right proportions, steeping, trying tweaking. If you set goals for your mixing you will never get bored again."

Why would they vape of they don't like it lol, but I get your point. And it's true, it's smokers and non smokers that hate it, which is basically everyone who doesn't vape. We get a lot of hate. Though I will say, as far as non smokers go, I et less shit from them than smokers, smokers are the first to talk shit. ""Robots dick"" ""you look like a fag"" why don't you just quit like a man"" ""why don't you just smoke like a man"" but the non smokers usually comment that they like the smell and that cigs smell like shit. But then they call me a fag any way and say I should just quit.   Jerks."

I'll go about 2 weeks and then normally a hangover where i smoked too many cigs will happen and ill fall back in love with my Mod. Its a vicious cycle but in the end I'm smoking much less then i did before it came around so I'm happy.

Or at the least it's really just the same in the end. I got my pipe and my other cloud chaser rdas to just mess around with, but even then it just kind of becomes another thing.  I vape mostly for the flavors now, and the strange need to have something in my mouth. The pipe helps me with that and to look like a total sir. I'd say if it's time to go, then have a goodbye party to your vaping. It's one of the rare industries where we are glad to see people enter and leave."
Vaping,3e482d,Aaronsif,3,Tue Jul 21 20:51:55 2015 UTC,I started vaping around 2012 and looking back then. The cigalikes were one of the only popular options. It's not that people are skipping steps. It's that the vapor industry is making strides in my opinion.
Vaping,3e482d,MelancholyMyo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:44:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah there was no subox kit for 60$ even a year or two ago. Now it almost senseless not to get one if you are just starting.

I ordered an Evic VT this weekend. Should be here any day. I think it's a big jump from what i've got, but like you said, skipping steps along the way saves money. From what I understand, I only have RDAs and Mechanicals to move on to from this point.   And considering how much i've saved with not buying cigs after 12 years, it was totally justified."

Vaping,3e482d,Savty123,2,Tue Jul 21 21:40:48 2015 UTC,I started vaping around November 2013. I bounced between many different ego style batteries and tanks for a little over a year. Got an istick 30w and a subtank mini around early May. Never looked back.
Vaping,3e482d,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:12:11 2015 UTC,"I have iStick 20w. Again at the time I didn't see the advantage of the 30w since I was using a pro tank 3 at the time (bad salesman). Then I broke my tank. Went back to get another tank and was interested in the kanger sub tank. Salesman still tried to get me to buy the nautilus because of my battery. I had to explain to him that I will eventually but the 30w and I want the sub tank.   He was nice enough to swap out the 5ohm coil it came with for a 12 ohm   So now I'm using a iStick 20w with a kanger sub, but I'm restricted to the 1.2 ohm for now."

Vaping,3e0wut,grizzly822,3,Tue Jul 21 11:43:07 2015 UTC,"I really like it. The only problem is they tend to have electrical issues. I think the visual appeal to these and the classic square nose petes, kw's, freightliner xl's etc is the sharper lines and angles.  All of the popular late model trucks are too bulbous and rounded imo. I definitely prefer the dash layout over the cascadia and the prostar.  It doesn't ride as smooth as the others but I prefer actually being able to feel the road. I have my company's only volvo daycab and all the other trucks ride like a crown vic. The Volvo doesn't bounce me around our anything but it's definitely not as soft.  Good power with the Volvo D13 motor and Eaton Fuller tranny. The big square nose trucks have too large a turning radius for my job and the cabs are relatively skinny. If I could choose any truck it'd probably be this really sexy lonestar daycab"
Vaping,3e0wut,NotoriousN-I-C,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:20:34 2015 UTC,The only thing I found about the Volvos that I don't like is the damn door handles. I'm a long haul driver.

I think all of my juices taste burnt (using jimmy the juice man 'shurb' and a couple of space jam products, so it's not like I have shitty juice!) I changed the coil twice, prepped it properly, played around with the voltage to make sure it wasn't that, and it seriously is horrible. What the fuck am I doing wrong?"
Vaping,3e0wut,SoberDreams,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:31:57 2015 UTC,Is the juice too thick to wick properly? Try another flavor.
Vaping,3e0wut,TamponCannon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:11:26 2015 UTC,I found that the V1 coils work best with 60/40 juices and under and you can't really go up past 27watts. the V2 coils didn't give me a problem with max VG juice until I took them up past 45 watts. I hear the RBA is better but I haven't tried it yet.
Vaping,3e0wut,freenow82,0,Tue Jul 21 09:06:06 2015 UTC,"did you drip liquid into the coils before you put the base on and started vaping? The coils and wicks need to be properly saturated. Also, with the horizontal OCC coils, they work best with 70/30 juice and lower. Max VG won't wick so well. The new coils are better for wicking, but past 40-45 watts or so you can start getting dry hits. You are probably doing one of these things wrong, report back and let us know how it goes"
Vaping,3e0wut,the993speaks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:20 2015 UTC,"The coil that came with it you can set to up to 50 watts, but i wouldnt go past 35. The coils that you buy after that have a range of 15-30 watts, and I keep those at 20 watts. I know what you mean with the burning taste, a lot of time you just have to turn down the wattage."

The start up cost may be more to vape but then there's almost no daily cost after. Cigs cost me over 300$ a month. Vaping is costing me ~50$ a month for juice and a coil or two.
Vaping,3e1dgw,XxSCRAPOxX,2,Tue Jul 21 13:13:25 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though. When you look at it without analyzing, you may think that vaping is more expensive.   Also, I used the most expensive pack that I can think of. Most packs of cigarettes are cheaper than Marlboro premiums"
Vaping,3e1dgw,Galactable,2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:06 2015 UTC,I smoked American spirits in ny. 12.50 a pack and up.  Can get them for 9ish in nj
Vaping,3e1dgw,rictorblackbus,3,Tue Jul 21 15:27:48 2015 UTC,"American Spirits are usually $5-6 max here, that's insane. Vaping has saved me so much money over the years I've had so much extra to just buy tons of vape shit. Was spending $10 every day on cigarettes, spend probably $50 a month on juice."
Vaping,3e1dgw,iLyLeGo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:04 2015 UTC,I'm from south Florida. When vaping first started picking up to be a good/practical alternative to cigarettes people were interested. I usually told non-smokers to not bother with it and encouraged smokers to give it a shot. Now no one in my city seems to like it and prefer cigarette smoking/smokers.
Vaping,3e1dgw,DebianSqueez,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"Miami native here. I have to say, after buying juice out of Brandon Vapor shark's house to seeing this community grow leaps and bounds, I do see more people vaping out and about in Miami. For example, I don't leave Churchill's pub stinking like an ashtray and having to shower and change clothes due to secondhand smoke stench. The last couple of times I was there, I saw about as many isticks as I did Marlboro light boxes, which is a BIG change from me, the lonely guy with the ego at the bar.  The progress is there, and who gives a crap what other people think? I like being able to walk up stairs and taste my food. I like not having that stench around my kids. If vaping is the new fedora, I'll put a feather in mine."
Vaping,3e1dgw,chillhumanoid,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:34 2015 UTC,"I love vapor shark, every one of their stores have such wonderful employees and I'm always excited to go there and talk with them. I live in Homestead so maybe it's just the people down here who make fun of vaping. Nice to hear that people who attend churchills are embracing vaping, need to go there again soon :)"

Vaping,3e1zja,Haruki_XXIV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:55:33 2015 UTC,There's some great apps for helping  you get your coils right. Personally I use Vapers Toolbox but there are loads available.
Vaping,3e1zja,hyprhzrd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:13:28 2015 UTC,"u/Haruki_XXIV is right, you should probably get vapers toolbox and fiddle around with that. Look up some beginner vapers coil building references, some local vape stores even have a flier that shows you some good coil builds and what ohms they come out to."

Vaping,3e3pg6,Zylias2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:19 2015 UTC,"No problem!, first of all I wouldn't recommend buying vape gear off amazon, there's plenty of UK vendors about. Secondly, I suggest going to the ecr_eu reddit, that's for european vapers lots of UK guys will help you out there. Samsung 25r's 18650 seem to be the way to go they're fairly cheap but really good ( I use two of them )  I personally bought myself a separate charging unit, it's safer in my opinion. They are called coils, you can buy them in packs of 5 mostly, but with the kanger set, you get a RBA which you can build your own coils should you desire too. The difference in 0.5 and 1.2 is less resistance and bigger lung hits.   Most people would recommend the kanger subox, I have one, they aren't bad at all. I love the box mod, not a huge fan of the tank, I'm going to get myself an Ego One as I mentioned above, for bringing around with me, it can also vape at 0.5 ohm.  My last suggestion to you would be , don't rush a purchase. Do plenty of research, there's nothing worse than burning 50 / 60 quid on a setup and find out you could have gotten one so much cheaper, or a one that suits you better a few weeks after buying it! Any more questions PM me! Best of luck mate."
Vaping,3e3ovr,headshot442,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:40 2015 UTC,"Cleaning the tank is easy. Take it apart, remove the coil, and just wash/soak it with hot water and dish soap. Rinse, air dry, reassemble.   Coils might be trickier. I know an overnight soak in vodka or everclear works for the cheaper silica-wicked coils, but I haven't tried it with a cotton-based coil yet."
Vaping,3e3ovr,Targren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:26 2015 UTC,"No, you don't have to change out OCC coils every time you want to change flavors. But expect the flavor soaked in the coil to linger and mix with the new flavor for a little while."
