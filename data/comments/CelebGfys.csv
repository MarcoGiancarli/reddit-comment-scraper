CelebGfys,38b5dw,marcelothefellow,3,Wed Jun 3 21:43:18 2015 UTC,"Fancams are a big thing in kpop. There are some dedicated fans who record lots of different groups and always have good equipment to do it. Some groups have even gained a lot of popularity solely because of those fancams.   I think a big part of it is that kpop fans accept that attractiveness, style over substance, choreography, etc are big reasons for the popularity of certain groups. Compare that to over here where people try pretending that someone like Katy Perry is famous because of her musical talent."

CelebGfys,35i9sg,adragontattoo,3,Sun May 10 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"Are you actually this stupid, or just messing around? That is a genuine question to you. In what fucking world is anybody in a kitchen sexist? You really seem like the type of person that just wants to get mad over shit that isn't even there just to be upset with. Thank you though, I found my trigger, retards like you."
