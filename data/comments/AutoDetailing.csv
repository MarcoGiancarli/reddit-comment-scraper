Scuff easily come off with a bit of compound or polish.  Scratches can only be repaired with the severity of its' depth.  If the scratch only takes off a little bit of the clear coat, you can use a bit of compound to bring it back to shine like new.  If the scratch goes completely through the clearcoat, your options are to touch it up or repaint the panel."

AutoDetailing,3e3eik,Im-an-ME,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"Even though it's aluminum, treat it just like paint for prep.  IronX, Sonax Full Effect and/or Clay should be used to get surface contaminants off the paint.  You want the aluminum as smooth as possible before you start getting into polishing.  Once it's all clean, you'll need to use wool pads to cut the tank to shine it up.  There are different wool pads, some are thick and some are soft.  And you want to be sure you're using a metal polish for best results.  Usually rouge is used to polishing aluminum, though I'm sure you can get away with compounds too.  I'd just be a bit skeptical as aluminum will show every swirl man knows when you're getting closer to your final stages of polishing.  And to answer your rotary vs DA question, you're better off going to your local Hone Depot and picking up a Rotary Machine.  It'll save you a lot of hassle, plus Home Depot has a great return policy if the tool doesn't perform to standard."

I would use m105 on the tank as it is basically metal. You do not use wool pads on aluminum like that too. Microfiber pads on a da should be good."

(oh yeah, these are mobile and rechargeable so there would be a difference in the caliber of battery provided...which most lamps don't offer anyways).  But if you want cheap and ""good enough"", these are definitely not for you. If you want the best stuff this is for you. It's pretty much exactly like the cars we get paid to work on. Do you think the performance, quality, exclusivity and craftsmanship multiplies along with cars worth multiple times other cars? Diminished returns does not mean something isn't worth a premium.

AutoDetailing,3e03br,Pinkman2012,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:33 2015 UTC,I usually go through 3 or 4 depending on how much compounding I'm doing. I was asking because it probably had a ton of spent product and paint built up which is why it seemed moist. No matter how much you clean the pad(which should be as much as possible) there's still an inevitable build up that reduces your cut.
AutoDetailing,3e03br,cda555,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:38 2015 UTC,Sorry for the dumb question here but should I clean it at all while I'm cutting?  I only cleaned it after I was done.
AutoDetailing,3e03br,cda555,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:14 2015 UTC,"Nope, not a dumb question at all. I was very uninterested in cleaning my pads and all that when I started and I got results all over the place. You should be cleaning it often while working.  Working clean is extremely important to producing consistent results. You want to clean your pad in between every section pass because you have a few things that get built up on the pad during your working - the paint you are compounding off the car, the dried up buffing liquid(M105) and any dirt/contamination that's being pulled up as well.     I'd give this article a read on how/why to clean often: http://www.autogeekonline.net/forum/how-articles/20135-how-clean-your-foam-pad-fly.html"

Canadian dollar is weak and I'll have to deal with S&H+Custom fees so I'm going to hold out for the next good sale :P  Kudos to your community manager/social marketing team. They're the reason I have a good impression of your company and part of the reason I plan to buy from you next sale (2nd reason is just HQ MF).  Cheers!"

I'm close to the border so I don't worry about S+H and I still don't buy stuff down south anymore unless it's a huge savings. After conversion and visa fees its basically 70 cents on the dollar. Not good."

As for the Canadian-factor, you'll be happy to know that we are currently finalizing a deal that will have a TRC Microfiber Distributor on your side of the border very soon!   That should help alleviate most of the economic discrepancies. :)  Once they've ordered and loaded their stock, we'll make a point of announcing it for sake of all our friends in the north!"

AutoDetailing,3e049a,PrussianBleu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:56 2015 UTC,Purchased one last week and it came dead on arrival... I might re think a PC. I went and returned it to Lowes and got a new one. That one broke within the first 5 minutes of ownership before I could even get a pad on it. Go with something else

You name it we have it if PC makes it. A lot of it has lasted a long time through the years. The only reason we buy new tools is to just have updated tech and fresh equipment.
