ZettaiRyouiki,3dssdt,Dirst,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:10:31 2015 UTC,You should read the manga. I just re-read it for the third or fourth time and it's still amazing.
ZettaiRyouiki,3dssdt,Kryptospuridium137,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:42:54 2015 UTC,"Heh, I literally finished it half an hour ago.   Took me a while to get into it, but holy fuck the anime doesn't hold a candle to that suffering. Especially around volume 5.   I think the anime is making some smart choices with the structure of the story, though (when characters appear and such)."
ZettaiRyouiki,3dssdt,Dirst,2,Sun Jul 19 14:59:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's too early to judge the anime, though. Especially with the dog appearing at the start, I can't wait to see what happens there... And there's something noticed about Megumi only after reading through this many times, and I really want to see if the anime makes it more clear than the manga..."
ZettaiRyouiki,3dssdt,Kryptospuridium137,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:14:21 2015 UTC,"[For any stray poster, here be spoilers]   Yeah, I guess you're right, but there's a few things I believe they'll cut based on what they've already shown:   For one, the dog will actually be part of the show. For a moment there I thought maybe the dog was also part of her imagination, but the other girls seem to react to the dog just fine, so he's clearly more present than Megumi is.   For another, I think they'll cut all the Mall chapters, which is a good and a bad thing. It's good because it's kinda filler, and they can show her story in other ways. But it's bad because Yuki is actually useful for the first time ever the, so I'm kind of on the fence, and waiting to see what they do with it.   They only have 12 episodes to work with, but they'll probably get a second season considering the manga is selling like hotcakes.   My guess is that they'll end the season with the reveal of Yuki zombie, and leave it in a cliff-hanger in this exact scene.   If they do that, they'll absolutely destroy people."
ZettaiRyouiki,3dssdt,Dirst,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:43:58 2015 UTC,"[Continuing spoilers]  A friend and I were speculating about a single mall flashback episode to explain Miki's roots. They mentioned how they found her in a mall, so I'm sure they'll explain it for the newcomers.  I also want the dog to stick around, but I have a bad feeling that a few episodes in it'll die like it does in the manga and that's going to destroy me no matter how much I predict it.   I really hope it gets a second season (the source material certainly deserves it), but I doubt they'll leave the first season with that kind of cliffhanger. It's too risky if they don't get a second season, and might turn off a lot of people. I think it's more likely they'll end it with one of the many semi-cliffhanger chapter endings where they're about to go out on a trip.  Also no new manga chapter in so long and I'll be devastated if Ruu-chan is another hallucination, since Rii-san's state has been becoming more like Yuki's at the start of the manga."
ZettaiRyouiki,3dssdt,Kryptospuridium137,2,Sun Jul 19 18:03:08 2015 UTC,"[Still spoilers]   I don't think they'll use a whole episode on that. Maybe it'll be a B story. But yeah, they'll definitely dive into that, and probably very soon too.   God, yes, man. That whole business with the dog is gonna be so, so soul-crushing. Especially if they actually show the zombie dog scratching their door.   I don't know, man, with how good the manga is selling I'd say a second season is pretty certain. Though maybe not until next year, when there's more material out. You're right it would be risky, though, so maybe they'll just cut it around the time they find the document, or some such. That would be a really high note to end it too. I don't know, I really think they're gonna go all-out with this anime, we're gonna suffer a lot.    if Ruu-chan is another hallucination   Fuuuuck, I hadn't even think of that! Can you imagine? And thinking back, it's kind of too perfect she just happened to find her just at that moment, in that school, all by herself. It's pretty suspicious."
ZettaiRyouiki,3dssdt,Dirst,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:41:21 2015 UTC,"I almost want to stop reading and watching the whole thing to just believe everything works out, Ruu-chan is fine, everyone lives, the syringe cured Kurumi, etc. And damn, When Miki asks if the medicine worked and Kurumi brushes it off, I want to take that as just Miki being a pessimist and making shit up, but if the medicine was actually just holding back the infection temporarily and not completely curing it, and my Shovel Goddess might still be infected... gaaaah, I don't even want to think about it."

ZettaiRyouiki,3casbv,JBHUTT09,3,Mon Jul 6 13:21:40 2015 UTC,/r/random led me here. What is this subreddit about?
ZettaiRyouiki,3casbv,DickInTheDryer,5,Tue Jul 7 00:23:24 2015 UTC,"From the sidebar:   Zettai Ryouiki, (""Absolute Territory""), is the tiny strip of visible thigh between longsocks/tights/thighhighs, and a skirt/dress/shorts. Any subject is allowed; anime/manga/video games/etc., or human (although we ask that all models are above the age of 18)."
ZettaiRyouiki,3casbv,DickInTheDryer,3,Tue Jul 7 00:24:29 2015 UTC,"That's actually a thing? Damn, nice! Now, is this a sexual fetish, or is it just something you guys (or girls) find cute, or what?"
ZettaiRyouiki,3casbv,DickInTheDryer,4,Tue Jul 7 00:26:38 2015 UTC,"Some find it sexual, but we just find it cute and aesthetically pleasing."
ZettaiRyouiki,3casbv,redheaded_robot,3,Tue Jul 7 00:29:15 2015 UTC,"While I personally don't share your passion for this, I can understand why some people would. Thank you for sharing!"
ZettaiRyouiki,3casbv,DickInTheDryer,5,Tue Jul 7 00:30:40 2015 UTC,No problem! Hope you find something more to your liking.
