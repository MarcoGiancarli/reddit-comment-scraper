wwi,3dzfnb,DuxBelisarius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:25 2015 UTC,An excellent book; I hope enjoy reading it as much as I did!
wwi,3dzfnb,ferriolom,2,Tue Jul 21 02:05:58 2015 UTC,It's decent. I got the audible version but it's narrated by the author.  This kinda ruins it. The author gets really excited about dark/somber things.  The book itself had some insight and tells an interesting story. If you don't like detailed synopsis of battles you will not like it though.
wwi,3dzfnb,thasryan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:34:42 2015 UTC,"Sounds good. I've always wanted to get a deeper understanding of the situation the Austro-Hungarians were in leading up to the war. All of the single volume histories I've read up until now have featured no more than a single chapter blaming ethnic tensions and outdated technology for the weakness of the Empire.  Just downloaded a copy from Audible, and am looking forward to it. Thanks."

He was one of 6 who made it back alive and he had to swim across a river to do so. He became a vicar after the war, and woke up most nights for the rest of his life screaming. It's truly horrific to think of a 95% casualty rate, but what really saddened me was his family nickname- crazy uncle Albert. He had a thousand yard stare and other family members who knew him said his screams annoyed them. He'd experienced true horror, and he was deemed a nuisance for it."

He spent his time in the service cutting spruce trees for aircraft production.   He said when the war ended,  they simply threw their tools into piles and went home. That's all I know.   Unfortunately,  he died before I was old enough to really talk to him about it."
wwi,3c8zrb,HillbillyInHouston,3,Mon Jul 6 00:56:24 2015 UTC,"Here we go.  My great grandfather was in the US 82id, he was in the same regiment or company as Sgt. Alvin York, they were actually fairly close friends. On that famous charge (the one that got York the Medal of Honor) my grandpa was one of the guys cut down. He was shot in the leg and crawled back to his own lines.  On a different occasion he was with his unit when they came under gas attack. The men scrambled but grandpa was shot in the leg (again). In the chaos he crawled away and managed to find a cellar which belonged to a house which no longer stood. The only things remaining in the cellar were a pile of hay and a seemingly infinite supply of canned tomatoes.   So he treated his wounds, ate tomatoes and stayed put. The frontline had shifted following the attack, he was now wounded behind enemy lines. For 10 days he hid from the Germans. Eating tomatoes and waiting in the hay with a knife, ready for the occasional soldier who came down to take some cans. He was never discovered though.   After the troop movement outside had died down a week and a half later, he decided to make a break for it. He made it out of the cellar but found he still couldn't walk. So he started to crawl on all fours to make the roughly 1 km journey back to Allied lines. Unfortunately he came upon the battlefield where his unit had been previously attacked. He had to crawl past all the bodies, many of which he recognized as his friends. Apparently the gas or rats sped up the decomposition process so they were all skeletons by this point... Except for their faces, which were perfectly preserved behind the gas masks.   He eventually made it back to the lines and was taken to the infirmary. When he was sent home, he learned that his fiancé had died from Spanish flu. What a time to be alive.  My dad used to say that when he stayed with grandpa Ray in the early 60s, every night you could hear him screaming in his sleep. When my dad asked him why he was so haunted by the war, he responded ""the faces"". He refused to talk about the war with his family. It wasn't until after his death that the family did some digging and found out all that we know now. He never ate a tomato again for the rest of his life."

He didn't like to talk about the war but his medals indicate he was in pretty much every major engagement of the war that the United States was present for. We do know that he was gassed which created health problems for him that supposedly led to him dying (a ripe old age) in the 1970s. He was a hard-as-nails blacksmith all his life. I mostly remember him as a strong, gentle and kind man. I recently rediscovered his MP armband and uniform patches and I also have his helmet which you can view here. I've posted some photos of him in uniform as well but don't have the time right now to locate them.  My father's father was a 2nd Lieutenant in the 298th Aero Squadron. He was an architect and engineer and helped build airfields. He liked to spin a yarn or two and claimed he saw the Red Baron, something I have no way of verifying and I have my doubts. He requested to stay on after the war because he spoke fluent French and was very disappointed when they turned him down and sent him home. He went on to become a semi-famous architect in the New England area."

I also read somewhere that the US did not have capacity to produce (or/and ship to Europe?) enough spare uniforms, so units did not arrive in Europe with any extra uniforms. When parts of uniforms were worn out they were replaced with parts from the BEF, because the British had managed to scale up production enough and had a lot less difficulty to ship things to France. So many AEF soldiers, after a while in battle, would be dressed at least partly in one of the many possible shades of BEF khaki instead of their original more green uniforms. Unfortunately I do not remember the source for that bit of information, but I would be interesting in any source that can conform or contradict it."

Pre-WW1 armies were smaller, plus regiments often had their own colors, so you would have ""correct colors"" to mimic. Also by WW2 chemical processes had improved so that standard colors could be ensured at all factories producing uniforms.

Oh! If you haven't read ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" you're doing yourself a disservice.

I'll say in advance that Clark has a bias in favor of the Germans & Austrians, but I didn't find it to unduly affect his analysis.  There was only one point where I found it really colored his thinking, and that was where he didn't quite seem to acknowledge that the Kaiser's bluster could (and was) be interpreted differently throughout Europe, and not in a flattering way.  ""July Crisis"" by T.G. Otte for the July Crisis specifically.  I don't think Otte is as well-known, but I used a number of his works for a thesis I wrote, and I was blown away.  I bought this (his most recent work, as far as I know, though I haven't looked into it) shortly after it was released."
wwi,3azcos,stevel91,4,Wed Jun 24 22:20:41 2015 UTC,I would recommend you The First World War by Hew Strachan. It offers very good overview of every theater of the entire war. BBC has made documentary series based on this book.

wwi,3azcos,TheCaptainR,2,Thu Jun 25 17:26:42 2015 UTC,"Sleepwalkers by Christopher Clark is the best account of the reasons for the outbreak of the war that I have ever read.  He analyzes the complex relations between all the European powers dating back 100 years before the war.  He also is one of the only authors to take an in depth look at the competition in the Balkans which were just as much of a reason for the war as any.   A good overview of the war is First World War by Hew Strachan.  It's dense, but I don't think it is possible to write a survey of the war without being a little dense."
wwi,3azcos,garandguy11,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:10:10 2015 UTC,"I've posted this before:  I have been reading WW1 books for the past year or so. As mentioned The Zimmerman Telegram and Guns Of August are great picks. A book by the same author The Proud Tower gives great insights into the causes and the world views of the world at the beginning of the world. It's already well written. Catastrophe 1914 is another great book. It is mostly The Guns of August-January. So there's definitely some overlap with Tuchman's book. But it's very well put together different and interesting on its own right. George, Nicholas, and Willhem by Carter is an interesting book as it focuses on the dynastic and personal relationships between the three leaders. It also goes into the world view of the age as well, kinda like the Proud Tower. All great picks. Dan Carlin's podcast is a great overview. You can see the influence of Tuchman in his work as well. So that's where I'm at. There's another book I want to read called The Mad Catastrophe,but I haven't gotten there yet.  Mad Catastrophe was good as it highlights one of the less talked about major powers in World War 1.  Austria. If you get the audio book beware the author is also the orator in the copy I have, and he's very enthusiastic about things he should not be enthusiastic about.   Here"

Some collectors only collect items from certain units (i.e. air service) or only certain types of insignia (i.e. cap badges).  Even things such as post cards can get expensive given the right subject matter.  One word of warning: there are large and well populated segments of eBay and other on-line marketplaces that deal in militaria--fakes abound.

It would be helpful if the article gave us any more information than 'somewhere on the Somme'. But we do know the graffiti was left by infantrymen, and they wouldn't usually be allowed in the fighting tunnels (despite what Birdsong would have you believe). So I think this cave or cellar was probably just one used for shelter by the infantry and the tunnellers probably had no involvement."

As PaulMorel mentioned before, All Quiet on the Western Front is seen as both the zenith of Great War literature and movies. The version from 1930 won an Academy Award for best picture, for example. A contemporary French example would be Wooden Crosses (1932) by Raymond Bernard.  Another excellent example of a WWI movie is Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory (1957). My own personal recommendation though is going to be La Victoire en chantant (released as Black and White in Color) that won an Academy Award for best foreign picture for 1976. It is one of the very few movie that takes place in Africa during WWI and it's quite an underrated and overlooked black comedy."

wwi,38ws80,EtrianOddity,2,Mon Jun 8 21:37:20 2015 UTC,"Let's start with Barbara Tuchman. Barbara Tuchman is a popular historian, widely criticized by historians even today. While that is a debate that perhaps is too long to go through here, Barbara Tuchman's work leaves much to desire to someone reading it in 2015. While it attracts laymen with its colorful descriptions and the way she puts you on the ground, the scholarship about WWI has gone beyond her to such an extent that her work is simply outdated. Thus in that way, she is indeed the Dan Carlin of books due to the fact that many has read her, that her work does work as an entry point and that she makes dubious generalizations and conclusions that contemporary historians would not have made. Today, it is an interesting read due to its place within the historiography of WWI and Tuchman's great writing - but does not hold up as a work of WWI scholarship.  Like someone mentioned to you already, Dan Carlin is not a historian but a self-proclaimed entertainer. Someone might argue against it, saying that his use of primary sources (in combination with secondary sources) is certainly proof that he is an historian. Yet his methods are far from it. His research is based on outdated scholarship on the war, like Tuchman he certainly makes some dubious claims and conclusions and he's sensationalist. Since I am approaching this from the way he works, I feel like the comparison to a HC documentary is more than fair. It too, believe it or not, has writers that research both primary and secondary sources and compile it into a script. It too makes dubious claims, generalizations and conclusions. The main difference here is format and time.   No one doubts the ability of Dan Carlin to engage people on a subject in a very accessible way. I'm very certain that his work will lead to many young men and women to some day become historians themselves. However, to someone who is already beyond that stage, Dan Carlin is not exactly my preferred source for historical scholarship. For that, I turn towards the historians that are actually doing the hard work of researching and writing to move WWI scholarship forward into new frontiers."
wwi,38ws80,Bernardito,0,Mon Jun 8 09:12:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply! I'm a fan of Dan and totally understand where you're coming from and understand the distinction between the both - I was just interested in peoples perspective between him and Tuchman.    ""writers that research both primary and secondary sources and compile it into a  script""   I have to pull you up on comparing Dan to the History Channel, unless you know something I don't? Seriously, do you? I work in film post production and around here a lot of the war history documentaries are money sinks for the production team - they're cheap to produce. I would be blown away if I found out if their productions actually used writers who did research with primary and secondary sources.  In my field, we love and encourage the people who bring more enthusiasts into the flock. I guess that's just academia for you.   *edit    WWI scholarship forward into new frontiers   also can you expand? for my personal interest"
wwi,38ws80,mnmleon,2,Mon Jun 8 10:53:21 2015 UTC,"Now, I'm not going lie, I definitely see where you are coming from when you mention war history documentaries. There are certainly some which I'd be surprised if they are based off more than a few outdated books (if even that). Like you mention, they are cheap to produce. Perhaps I am giving them too much credit (since I am more used to BBC productions, some of which are starting to resemble HC documentaries more and more). If I'm going to speak in more general terms, documentaries are not exactly reliable sources for historical knowledge. Even the best ones, which draw heavily on primary (either in the form of a V/O reading a letter etc. or an on-camera interview) and secondary sources, have their limitations. The point I am trying to make is that these forms of teaching history have great limitations. Dan Carlin, whose work if turned into a documentary series might have been a great one, would still have been equally limited.  What would you like me to expand regarding WWI scholarship? :) There's plenty to be said. The research into WWI is constantly on the move, with new approaches to old material and new focus on forgotten material. What I feel is the most exciting progress in the last 20 years is the fact that we have a surge of new scholars working with Africa's part in WWI, among them many African historians."
wwi,38ws80,Bernardito,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:31:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%. The man can really get you interested in a subject.

wwi,38ws80,tremblemortals,4,Mon Jun 8 00:38:56 2015 UTC,"The strength of Dan Carlin is that he helps you to enter into the story, to experience it in some way. Which fuels your passion for history and makes the events more real.  The weakness, as everyone says, is that he's not always right. And he has a tendency to sensationalize.  On the weight of it, I think he's doing pretty good at popularizing history. But as he--and everyone else--insists, he's not a historian himself. He's a fan. And you need to keep that in mind."
wwi,38ws80,tremblemortals,3,Sun Jun 7 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"Your comment seems well tempered.. I appreciate your words. In contrast to your claim that he is not always right, I felt like he too often disclaimed things like... ""There is a lot of debate about this.."" or  ""Many historians differ about.."" and it annoyed me a bit. ~ I actually would have preferred one disclaimer stating he was not a historian and that he simply shared his opinions with more conviction.   I have always felt that the best way to get a feel for history (because we can never really know history) is to find a way to imagine yourself living at a particular time.   All that said, I look forward to perusing this subreddit and gathering more context for my imagination."
wwi,38ws80,Branston_Pickle,2,Mon Jun 8 02:45:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's great that he mentions it whenever there is conflict of opinion among historians, because it tells you that it might not have happened the way he presents it. Which is important when you're presenting history.  Also, if you're listening to a 4-hour podcast episode, it's easy to get so involved in the story you stop thinking critically about it, even with a disclaimer at the beginning. Humans love listening to stories. We get wrapped up in them if the storyteller is good enough. And if you're presenting your story as truth, but you don't know the truth exactly, it's important to break people out now and then to remind them of your own limitations. :)"

Plus the forage cap wasn't used in dress uniforms at all by the RA in WW1 - they had a variation on the home service helmet which looks a bit like a pickelhaube or a British Police Custodian helmet.

Another 3 actual reasons why there were used:  Smooth running: Rotaries delivered power very smoothly because (relative to the engine mounting point) there are no reciprocating parts, and the relatively large rotating mass of the crankcase/cylinders (as a unit) acted as a flywheel.  Weight advantage: many conventional engines had to have heavy flywheels added to smooth out power impulses and reduce vibration. Rotary engines gained a substantial power-to-weight ratio advantage by having no need for an added flywheel.  Improved cooling: when the engine was running the rotating crankcase/cylinder assembly created its own fast-moving cooling airflow, even with the aircraft at rest.  All of those reasons come right from wikipedia"

wwi,360kg8,ElizabethMoon1992,1 point,Fri May 15 02:02:07 2015 UTC,"Everyone talks about the Shell Crisis as if it were merely a shell shortage problem.  But that might not be the whole story.  Sir Hart clarifies in The Real War that ""...the need was for more heavy guns and not merely for more shells.""[1]  The argument goes that high explosive shells could destroy wire, field works, fortresses, so on by the force of their explosion. So by having heavier artillery the shells would carry larger payloads, and would therefore inflict more damage.   But it is much more difficult to design, manufacture, and then deploy heavier guns versus more of the same shells, which may be why there is so much talk about the shells and not so much about the guns.  About those duds: The explosive used in the French shells were Mellinite. I don't know offhand what was used by the British. Mellinite is a very stable explosive. To the point where it is hard to detonate it reliably. The shells would strike their targets, fail to explode, and leave undetonated mellinite all over. The fix to this problem was fulminate of mercury detonators. This makes it very easy to detonate mellinite, thereby exploding at the target instead of harmlessly covering the target like a water balloon. But it comes with this nasty side effect of premature detonation. The fulminate of mercury detonators destroyed 25% of the French 75s during the first year of the war alone.  So its a bit more complicated than ""just make more shells!""  [1] Sir B. H. Liddell Hart, The Real War, Little, Brown & Co. (Boston: 1930) 127"

French helmets were based off firefighter's helmets, and the ridge is there to deflect falling debris away from the side of the head.  French Colonial and French forces were equipped in the same way, so no way to tell for sure with the colouring of the photo.   The Belgians also fought wearing French uniforms, but they never left Belgium so we can rule that country out fairly easily based on the place where the photo was taken."

wwi,345nrp,Brickie78,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:38:54 2015 UTC,It isn't just in online gaming. I often wonder just how much of the general toxicity online is due to the number of children present.

That may sound stupid but I literally CANNOT play..lets say GTA V online. I spawn DIE. I go to the menu DIE. Now the thing is that it isnt only kids. Same with every game. We dont need to take the kids out..we need to take the immature ones or...FUCKING CUNTS out. Im not trying to make it sound like im so cool but when I was 13 I was one of the leaders of an 18+ clan. When I was 12 I was playing with 20 year olds. Even if we introduced a ""age filter"" somehow..there would be a way around it. What we need to do is have some sort of ""dunce system"" like GTA V had. Lets say they get reported 3 times...your out in dunce land now. Now again..that sucks. You could have these immature kids lying or getting butthurt and report you. This way would not work without a fail safe somehow because we would all end up in a dunce lobby. But I dont want to have a ""age blocker"" thing because there are those kids that are great. And If I was 12 or 13 it would make me really sad that for one I would have to play with shitty people and 2 everyone judges me just on my age. I had to lie about my age till I was 16 just so people would even TALK to me. This turned into a long thing so good for those who stuck it out when im drunk and rambling. Hope this made some sence."

wwi,345nrp,livrem,1 point,Wed Apr 29 08:02:47 2015 UTC,"Actually the concept of squads in 1914 is a bit silly. I know it existed as an organizational thing (at least in some armies) and that you can dig up examples of platoons splitting up in squads (or sections) to fight, but having individual soldiers in a squad running around fighting over a larger area in 1914 is a bit much.  Even in 1918... or 1945... it is a bit much really to give individual soldiers the kind of freedom we see in games. Personally I would love to see a ""FPS"" where the player is more like a platoon or company commander and all the lower-ranked soldiers/NCOs are AI-controlled. Because then you get up to a level where the meaningful decisions really were (and you could still carry a gun and do some fighting at times; some commanders were known to do that quite frequently)."

By the time 1914 came about Australia was an independent nation but one of the agreements for Australian independence was that whenever the Crown (British Empire) went to war Australia would go to war.  However this doesn't really explain why so many Australians chose to fight in a war that had little to no physical impact back home.  Many Australians still considered themselves British or at least looked towards Britain as their mother/protector. So a big reason as to why Australians enlisted, was to help protect Britain. Some might have felt like they owed it to Britain.  A big reason why the Australian government wanted Australians to enlist was to help establish an Australian identity. One that didn't really exist until after WW1.  Unlike today back in 1914 Australia didn't have it's identity. The reason why ANZAC day became such a big thing because it really cemented the Australian identity of the Australian spirit and mateship.   Sorry if this sounds like rambling but this is what I remember from my schooling in Australia.   In short there is no one reason why Australians enlisted."

wwi,33vqrj,NomadFire,4,Sun Apr 26 06:53:09 2015 UTC,"Serving the mother country. Most Australians identified as British at this time. Although Australia was an independent nation and had no obligation to fight a European war, most people viewed Britain's fight as Australia's fight.  The sense of adventure was a great drawcard for Australian men to volunteer. The Australian Army was not able to fight in wars overseas at that time due to a legislative oversight, so the Australian Imperial Force was created. The pay was quite high and most believed the war would be over within 12 months.  So yeah, they fought for King and Empire and joined for an adventure.  I'm a high school history teacher. We do this a lot."

For the first time, Australia as a nation could prove that it was just as capable and mighty as any other country. That was the thought, anyway.  The result was that over 60% of Australia's volunteers became casualties, a huge figure for a country with such a small population."

wwi,33ijwl,MMMaus,2,Wed Apr 22 22:08:26 2015 UTC,"It's not-widely known fact that the Germans in WW1 never called the Marines ""Teufel Hunden."" American newspapers ran stories in April 1918 claiming that Germans had nicknamed the Marines “devil dogs.” This was prior to the Battle of Belleau Wood, which began on June 1.  The term very likely was first used by Marines themselves and appeared in print before the Battle for Belleau Wood,” Marine Corps History Divison’s Bob Aquilina said. “It gained notoriety in the decades following World War I and has since become a part of Marine Corps tradition.”  “We have no proof that it came from German troops though tradition says it came from German troops referring to Marines,” said museum rep Patrick Mooney. “There is no written document in German that says that the Marines are Devil Dogs or any correct spelling or language component of ‘Devil Dog’ in German.”  Read more: http://www.wearethemighty.com/marine-corps-myths-2015-04#ixzz3Y8N9k75R"

wwi,33fz90,gramturismo,2,Wed Apr 22 05:15:47 2015 UTC,"So with the 100th anniversary of WWI last year and all the coverage I'd been reading about, I felt inspired to try an artwork like this.  I decided it would be an aerial view because so much artwork depicting battlefields is right down at ground level, or it's just depictions of dogfights etc...    I've been letting it go for the last few months and feel the need to push forward and finish the thing.  The original is 30' x 24' inches but hopefully you can get enough detail from what I've uploaded to give some feedback.  A few questions I had:  -I want to add a trench at the top with the German side, does it look like a long enough distance?  (I know it could just be a British trench which had been captured)  -Were trenchcoats mostly just used when it rained or would average soldiers wear them often?  -How much separation was there between British and French troops?  That is to say would it seem odd to also have French soldiers in this scene?  -Do the fortifications seem appropriate?  That is to say does the bunker look right and should there  be more barbed wire around the field gun?  Anyway I'd love to get everybody's reactions!  EDIT:  The only thing I'm working on for the time being is adding more soldiers and more debris/craters."
wwi,33fz90,military_history,4,Wed Apr 22 05:32:15 2015 UTC,"It's a great piece of art, but if you're going for a realistic look there's a lot wrong with it. But I'll answer your questions before I get to that.   I want to add a trench at the top with the German side, does it look like a long enough distance?   Yes. Trenches were sometimes close enough that the two sides could hear each other talking so that seems like ample distance to me.   Were trenchcoats mostly just used when it rained or would average soldiers wear them often?   They were worn when it was cold, and being in the open in North-West Europe will often be cold. I see no reason why you shouldn't add some (though attacking troops would probably do without so their movements weren't restricted).   How much separation was there between British and French troops? That is to say would it seem odd to also have French soldiers in this scene?   It would be odd if they were sharing the same trenches. Each side had its agreed-upon sector of the front to hold. It would be rare, but not out of the ordinary, for troops from both countries to attack side by side where their sectors met.   Do the fortifications seem appropriate? That is to say does the bunker look right and should there be more barbed wire around the field gun?   At the moment they look like part of the Atlantic Wall rather than First World War trenches. The British didn't use concrete bunkers unless they were captured from the Germans. Moreover, the Germans didn't build big above-ground bunkers like that. They built small pillboxes which were just designed to hold machine guns (like you've got at the bottom of the picture). The far larger dug-outs serving as barracks and headquarters were almost always built underground, which concealed their location and made them stronger. The reason the Germans relied on concrete was that, holding the high ground in the Ypres Salient, they could not sink bunkers very deep before hitting a layer of 'Schwimmsande' inundated with water, which could not escape because of lower layers of clay. Since the dugouts were shallower, concrete made up for the lack of protection from earth. The British, on the lower ground, had different problems. They couldn't really use concrete because, under constant observation from the Germans, it was difficult to get all the necessary equipment to the front line. However, they were digging under the Schwimmsande in the clay, so they could dig much deeper than the Germans, and mostly used wood. So big overground bunkers are ahistorical. Smaller pillboxes captured from the Germans might be used by the British when there was no alternative, or after some extensive modification involving creating new entrances which no longer faced the enemy.  There should not be a field gun in the front line. This was only done very rarely, and with very small guns. A big howitzer like that would be out of the trench system in its own battery a couple of miles behind the line. The smaller gun would at least be placed in a support trench.  The trenches are very large by British standards, and the two small emplacements in the centre aren't historical. It was important not to advertise to enemy reconnaissance where your heavy weapons were and a round emplacement next to a straight trench was an invitation to 'bomb me'. Mortar positions would be made as inconspicuous as possible. Machine guns would usually just be mounted in a traverse of the trench in a little emplacement that wouldn't stand out from the other trenches--and they'd be trained diagonally along the trench line, rather than pointing straight at the enemy. This was a technique called enfilade which increased the effectiveness of fire by firing side-on to attacking troops.  There's a road through the middle of the trenches--this would not be done as it would provide a brilliant target for enemy artillery and give them an easy way to advance through your trench line if they captured it. In tank attacks, temporary bridges might be made over the trenches, or they would just drive over.  There should be a lot more wire.  As I say, it looks great (I particularly like the plane). Maybe you could look at Joe Sacco's The Great War if you want to go for a more realistic look."

wwi,33fz90,JDHoare,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:29:15 2015 UTC,I actually think the most realistic way to get some French in there is to have some being shown round the British trenches - it was quite common for officers of both countries to visit each other to observe the latest tactics.

wwi,33fz90,ruffthecrimedog,2,Thu Apr 23 18:26:51 2015 UTC,Wow this is incredible.  Keep in mind arty wouldn't be on the front line. Trench mortars sure but not full arty pieces. Those are usually kept behind the line in gun batteries.
wwi,33fz90,parlezmoose,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:02:05 2015 UTC,Yup.  I think I'll get rid of the bunker first (basically make it a trench instead.)
wwi,33fz90,LucasSidor,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:35:59 2015 UTC,Bunker is really cool and they did have them on the front line but most were blown to hell so the only really intact ones would also be behind the line. Most bunkers on the front line would mainly be made out of sandbags until the storage 1915 and on. Still awesome work i'm really impressed.
