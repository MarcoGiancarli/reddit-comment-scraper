In astrology it is supposedly an important time    While the planet may not reach the exact spot until the person is 29 or 30 years old, the influence of the Saturn return is considered to start in the person's late twenties, notably the age of 27  Psychologically, the first Saturn return is seen as the time of reaching full adulthood, and being faced, perhaps for the first time, with adult challenges and responsibilities    wikipedia   Saturn ascends, choose one or ten. Hang on or be humbled again.  Saturn comes back around to show you everything.  Let's you choose what you will not see and then  Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again.  Spits you out like a child, light and innocent.  Saturn comes back around. Lifts you up like a child or  Drags you down like a stone to  Consume you till you choose to let this go. Choose to let this go.   Also when you were around 27.5 you had your 10,000th day. Bet you didn't notice.

spaceporn,3dvfm7,lgnrogers,7,Mon Jul 20 02:51:28 2015 UTC,"The Cat's Eye Nebula is structurally a very complex nebula, and the mechanism or mechanisms that have given rise to its complicated morphology are not well understood. The central bright part of the nebular consists of the inner elongated bubble (inner ellipse) filled with hot gas. It in turn is nested into a pair of larger spherical bubbles conjoined together along their waist. The waist is observed as the second larger ellipse lying perpendicular to the bubble with hot gas.  The structure of the bright portion of the nebula is primarily caused by the interaction of a fast stellar wind being emitted by the central star with material ejected during the formation of the nebula. This interaction causes the emission of X-rays discussed above. The stellar wind, blowing with the velocity as high as 1900 km/s, has 'hollowed out' the inner bubble of the nebula, and appears to have burst the bubble at both ends.  It is also suspected that the central star of the nebula may be a binary star. The existence of an accretion disk caused by mass transfer between the two components of the system may give rise to polar jets, which would interact with previously ejected material. Over time, the direction of the polar jets would vary due to precession.  Outside the bright inner portion of the nebula, there are a series of concentric rings, thought to have been ejected before the formation of the planetary nebula, while the star was on the asymptotic giant branch of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. These rings are very evenly spaced, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for their formation ejected them at very regular intervals and at very similar speeds. The total mass of the rings is about 0.1 solar masses. The pulsations that formed the rings probably started 15,000 years ago and ceased about 1000 years ago, when the formation of the bright central part began.  Further out, a large faint halo extends to large distances from the star. The halo again predates the formation of the main nebula. The mass of the halo is estimated as 0.26–0.92 solar masses.   source  And this is the halo that extends around the nebula."

Of course, there was no way to bring it back home, so that particular one eventually burned up in the atmosphere, but the important part was testing the crafts performance in space before sending an exact copy of it off to the moon. Here is a short video about it."

spaceporn,3dsiir,KingLouie501,7,Sun Jul 19 07:23:56 2015 UTC,I watched all of those while playing Kerbal. I had a wonderful time.
spaceporn,3dsiir,prometheus5500,5,Sun Jul 19 08:12:56 2015 UTC,I'm old enough to remember all those flights that they took that were just for testing out parts of what would be the mission to the moon. As a young kid it seemed so frustrating. The ones that really got me was when they flew all the way to the moon just to orbit it but NOT land. That's like driving cross-country to the Grand Canyon and then staying in the car in the parking lot.
spaceporn,3dsiir,BAXterBEDford,5,Sun Jul 19 10:27:02 2015 UTC,The ones that really got me was when they flew all the way to the moon just to orbit it but NOT land.   Apollo 8 or Apollo 10?
spaceporn,3dsiir,msthe_student,2,Sun Jul 19 11:09:07 2015 UTC,"Well, they both did. I was pretty young, so I wasn't aware of all the details then, and I don't want to pretend I was now. But in retrospect, with 10 they had already tested the LEM..."
spaceporn,3dsiir,BAXterBEDford,4,Sun Jul 19 12:09:45 2015 UTC,Well 10 could've landed. Just they wouldn't have been able to get back.
spaceporn,3dsiir,afd33,7,Sun Jul 19 14:26:19 2015 UTC,"Because if you're going all the way to land on the moon, you want to be sure the equipment works so before 11 there where lots of manned and unmanned tests of various parts of the stack. this image if from Apollo 9, which tested the complete stack in earth orbit.

spaceporn,3ds07g,jasalmfred,3,Sun Jul 19 18:11:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, they're called rogue stars, or intergalactic stars. The first one was discovered in 1997.  Gravity has a tendency to pull everything together, kind of like marbles on a trampoline if you're sitting in the middle of it. They're all gonna cluster around you.  Keep in mind that stars are born in galaxies as a result of gravitational forces. But things happen, and some studies estimate that half of all stars are destined to fly around the universe with no galaxy to call home."

The probe was supposed to perform a flyby with a distance of only 12,500 km (7,800 mi) to Pluto. A few days ago, Tuesday to be precise, the probe finally reached the point of its trajectory nearest to Pluto and already delivered the first detailed photograph of Pluto and also of its largest Moon, Charon.  Here's a comparison to what has been the sharpest image of Pluto until Tuesday.  Because of its billion miles far distance to Earth it will take months to transmit all the gathered data back to the NASA scientists. There are a lot of awesome photos and knowledge to be published by NASA in the upcoming months. So exciting! :)"

spaceporn,3dlyl8,Falrockiansteel,6,Fri Jul 17 16:15:01 2015 UTC,"To actually answer (and I'm no physicist and I'm just going off some first year astronomy course I took in college, so if someone corrects me then I'm sure they're right), my understanding is that the earth's atmosphere scatters blue light. This is why the sky is blue. But at a sunset, when the light is travelling through more of the atmosphere, the blue has already scattered leaving only the remaining light (so, you see mostly red).  On Mars, the atmosphere scatters red light (hence the red sky during the day). Same principal: at sunset, the red has scattered so you see blue."

spaceporn,3dlyl8,Astroturf420,2,Fri Jul 17 18:23:34 2015 UTC,Hopefully there can be an answer for this - the sky really does have a patch of blue.  What an amazing photo.
spaceporn,3dlyl8,TruthnotBeauty,3,Fri Jul 17 16:08:32 2015 UTC,"Same as for why the sunset is red/orange on Earth, despite having a ""blue"" atmosphere. It's because light from the sun is scattered by the atmosphere. On Earth, blue is scattered away because of the chemical composition of the atmosphere. And once blue is scattered, only green and red colors remain; that's the orange color we see at sunset, because light travels a further distance through the atmosphere than when it is high up in the sky.  On Mars, since the chemical composition of the atmosphere is different, different colors will get scattered away. Here, red is scattered away, and at sunrise/sunsets where light travels further distance in our atmosphere, only the blue and green remains, which is why they are a turquoise-ish color."

spaceporn,3dlyl8,Ivebeenfurthereven,2,Fri Jul 17 19:06:08 2015 UTC,"As per the article: ""2500 watt hours of electricity per day"" ....so (2.5 kWh/day) x (1.0259 day / Sol) = 2.565 kilowatt-hour per Sol = 2.57 pirate-ninjas. (What I said above)"

This is the same reason why you can't see stars in photos taken on the Moon - because the exposure necessary to see them would basically white out the lunar surface.  It's probably exposed ice."

Allegedly, about 5% of the officials stayed on the last day of the convention in order to vote on what constitutes planethood. Would it have gone the same way had everybody been there to vote is up for debate. However, the reason it is no longer a planet (it has not cleared its local orbit of debris) is kind of garbage. That criterion really only means ""if an object is too far away it's not a planet."" If you were to put Earth where Pluto is, it would no longer be a planet because it would pick up so much space junk in its local sphere of influence.

Pluto, being much smaller, has more objects of comparable mass in its neighborhood (plus it's orbit intercects with Neptune's) and it doesn't have the gravitational pull to throw them off course. Therefore, it's neighborhood is not cleared."
spaceporn,3dj0f0,Sausafeg,-14,Fri Jul 17 04:57:27 2015 UTC,"Who gave them that power and what checks and balances are there if we think they're misusing it?  What I'm saying is, they're a professional organization of people who study the physics of stars, they're a very small subset of humans, and this is an issue which clearly a lot of people take an interest in, so I don't think it's right that they can just declare that they are the arbiters of a concept (""planet"") which exists in the popular imagination just as much as many other things in everyday life do. They don't own the solar system or the English language!  Edit: I can't believe some people downvoting me literally think that if you and your friends decide to make a club to study something, that means you get to decide for all other people on Earth what a commonly used word means! So, if I make a club dedicated to studying ""sexism"", and my club decides ""sexism is defined as prejudice against women"", would you say ""well, they run the club on this, so we should let them have the final say on what this commonly used word means!"""
spaceporn,3dj0f0,theswerto,6,Fri Jul 17 07:30:11 2015 UTC,"The thing is that the IAU is an internationally recognized organization, made up of people who have dedicated their lives to the study of space and have a vested interest in it. That is where they get their power. It's a small subset of biologists (I believe) who are in charge of classifying and naming organisms yet no one complains about that.   I'm not sure what power they are ""misusing"" since they are the ones whose lives revolve around the classification of celestial bodies. Who else should classify these objects?"
spaceporn,3dj0f0,Sausafeg,-1,Thu Jul 16 23:09:04 2015 UTC,"I don't mind if all they're doing is classifying things for scientific purposes. I don't see why it's  But when they start encroaching on culture, e.g. here, then it becomes problematic. There's a clear cultural interest in space and ""other worlds"", which are commonly known as ""planets"" as they have been since antiquity. There's not a real need to insist on a fixed definition of ""planet"" in the cultural sphere, just as there isn't with most other terms in English: I don't know the official definition of a ""bottle"", I just know a lot of examples of bottles and I class similar things as bottles.  What I think the IAU should have done, is to create technical categories like Type 1 SSB, Type 2 SSB etc, and not used the word ""planet"" for any of these categories, and they should just have said that it's an imprecise layperson's word, since it's a word which lives in this broad cultural discourse, in the popular imagination.  The main reason I hate it, is that it doesn't enrich society in any way, it just creates a way for tiresome bores to cut you off with their pedantic and unnecessary ""corrections"" when you're just casually talking about Pluto. Everyone - even professional Pluto scientists - calls Pluto a planet in common parlance, because it walks, talks and acts like a planet - even the New Horizons people in the press conferences do, and they study it full time. Society would just be happier and science would progress more quickly if the IAU didn't pointlessly enable people to just say ""ACTUALLY!"" and sour otherwise enlightening and fun conversations about Pluto."
spaceporn,3dj0f0,theswerto,2,Thu Jul 16 23:47:51 2015 UTC,"I feel like anyone who argues the IAU's definition is right should also complain that sci-fi movies and TV shows use the term ""planet"" to refer to any body they land on without definitive proof said body has cleared its neighborhood.  The IAU doesn't have a word that refers to bodies orbiting a star in hydrostatic equilibrium that may or may not have cleared their neighborhoods. This is seriously flawed."

spaceporn,3dj0f0,ubsr1024,14,Thu Jul 16 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"It's about the same size as pluto, is actually more of a percentage of the mass in its orbital plane than pluto is (Kuiper Belt is far more populated than the asteroid belt), and was discovered before pluto (1801 to 1930). Neither one are planets by the IAU definition, and if you want to really start discussing what is or isn't a planet based on formation, Pluto is likely less of a planet than Ceres because ceres has the same history of development as the inner rocky planets, whereas pluto we have no idea how it formed."
spaceporn,3dj0f0,Testiculese,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:10:34 2015 UTC,"Ceres is no where near as big as pluto. Here is a comparison pic (slightly out of date since we now know that Pluto is larger than Eris).  Pluto actually has 2.5 times the radius of Ceres (1185 km vs 469 km) and almost 14 times the mass the Ceres.  So based on size alone it's reasonable to say that Pluto is more of a planet.  Also it is true that Ceres consists of about 1/3 the mass of the asteroid belt while Pluto is a much smaller fraction of the Kuiper Belt.  But the Kuiper belt is so much larger than the asteroid belt that it's an unfair comparison imo. It ranges from 30 AU to 50 AU from the Sun, giving it a huge area."
spaceporn,3dj0f0,theswerto,2,Fri Jul 17 00:01:39 2015 UTC,"But the latter part I said is the very line that defines a planet. If Venus had another Venus's worth of asteroids in its orbital path it'd be much harder to call it a planet than Mercury or Mars, even though its roughly the same size as Earth.   Size alone does not dictate what is or isn't a planet, if it did it'd be hard to call any of the rocky planets planets when compared to the gas giants, hell it'd even be hard to call Neptune or Uranus planets compared to Saturn and Jupiter."
spaceporn,3dj0f0,MehNmp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:56:17 2015 UTC,I agree that neither Ceres nor Pluto should be defined as planets just as you say because of all the other asteroids/Kuiper belt objects.

spaceporn,3dj0f0,Testiculese,2,Fri Jul 17 10:01:00 2015 UTC,"Relatively speaking, compared to the other planets, pluto is much closer to the size of ceres than Mercury is to Earth, the only planets closer to size are neptune and uranus (which are the closest), earth and venus (which are almost as close) and mars to earth (which is a little over half the radius)  Ceres by contrast is a little under 1/2 the radius of ceres.

spaceporn,3dioue,RyanSmith,5,Thu Jul 16 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has spotted the ""UFO Galaxy."" NGC 2683 is a spiral galaxy seen almost edge-on, giving it the shape of a classic science fiction spaceship. This is why the astronomers at the Astronaut Memorial Planetarium and Observatory, Cocoa, Fla., gave it this attention-grabbing nickname.  While a bird's eye view lets us see the detailed structure of a galaxy (such as this Hubble image of a barred spiral), a side-on view has its own perks. In particular, it gives astronomers a great opportunity to see the delicate dusty lanes of the spiral arms silhouetted against the golden haze of the galaxy's core. In addition, brilliant clusters of young blue stars shine scattered throughout the disc, mapping the galaxy's star-forming regions.  Perhaps surprisingly, side-on views of galaxies like this one do not prevent astronomers from deducing their structures. Studies of the properties of the light coming from NGC 2683 suggest that this is a barred spiral galaxy, even though the angle we see it at does not let us see this directly.  This image is produced from two adjacent fields observed in visible and infrared light by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys. A narrow strip which appears slightly blurred and crosses most the image horizontally is a result of a gap between Hubble's detectors. This strip has been patched using images from observations of the galaxy made by ground-based telescopes, which show significantly less detail. The field of view is approximately 6.5 by 3.3 arcminutes. Source"

spaceporn,3df161,BfmVfan1,18,Fri Jul 17 02:56:32 2015 UTC,"What does ""potentially active"" mean?"
spaceporn,3df161,DigitalMindShadow,39,Wed Jul 15 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"It means that there is some resurfacing process at work that removed a good 4 billion years of cratering.  This could mean that the surface replenished itself within the last 100 million years.  This could point to many things, including some cycle of sublimation and condensation, or even more interestingly towards an active interior, which could mean it may still be active today and have stuff like cryogeysers like what we see on Enceladus.  This seems to be the case with Pluto as well, time will tell.  This could have huge implications for not only the geology of small icy worlds but also their habitability, as we now have strong evidence to suggest that you can have a heated interior in these small solar system bodies without tidal heating."
spaceporn,3df161,Asiriya,7,Thu Jul 16 01:01:34 2015 UTC,Is it possible that the relatively crater-free surfaces of both Charon and Pluto is the result of a collision between the two bodies?
spaceporn,3df161,rasputine,27,Thu Jul 16 04:58:10 2015 UTC,"Interestingly Charon could have been formed in a similar way to Earth's moon, via a huge collision between Pluto and another object during the heavy bombardment.  This would help explain why Charon has a lot less volatile ices, since the debris blown on from such a huge impact would have vaporized the volatiles.  This would also explain the cluster of tiny moons and moonlets orbiting the Pluto-Charon system.  Chemical composition analysis of Pluto and Charon could help support this idea.  At first one might draw a similarity between Charon's smooth regions and the Moon's smooth mare regions (the darker areas of the lunar surface on the side that faces us).  In the moon's case, these were formed by oceans of lava that cooled over time.  In Charon's case, we would have ammonia and methane oceans that would have frozen over time, but given the fact that Charon does not have an atmosphere (at least...not that we can tell yet, it would be another big surprise if it did), and the temperatures out there, it would be difficult to maintain this for a long enough time after Charon formed.  It would have frozen pretty quickly, long ago, and doesn't easily explain the low density of craters in the southern hemisphere.  This all being said, there are tons of other features on Charon that we can already see, namely the huge ravines and canyons that are equally difficult to explain without the surface experiencing some kind of stretching or breaking apart.  Now this may not necessarily be tectonics, and these features could be quite old, so it's hard to say at this point.  All we can see is that the density of craters in the southern region tells us that the age of that surface can't be more than a few hundred million years old given the estimated density of impactors in that area of the solar system.  As we get more data, hopefully some of these questions get answered.    TL;DR The only way that a giant impact could explain the lack of craters is if A. our theories about Charon forming from a giant impact between some large object and Pluto are correct and verifiable and B. Charon is a lot younger of an object overall than we once thought and this Charon-forming impact occurred less than a few 100 million years ago, which seems unlikely, but then again, this mission so far has uncovered a lot of interesting stuff that was once thought unlikely!"

This leads most worlds without some erosional process going on to be covered completely in craters across their whole surface, take Ceres for example.  Now look back at Charon and you'll see that in the Southern hemisphere there are huge plains of smooth craterless terrain.  This means there has to have been some process that cleaned the terrain up and removed the craters."

spaceporn,3ddik9,aryeh95,6,Wed Jul 15 17:21:52 2015 UTC,Plus the colors are artifacts of processing.  Notice how the sky becomes blue with height in the picture.  That is a result of using color balance to subtract light pollution (color balance is a multiply).  The result is an unnatural bluing as the scene becomes fainter.  The Milky Way is not actually blue like that.

spaceporn,3d8shy,SilverAg11,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"The part about helium floating into space isn't true? The reason Helium floats is because it is less dense than the gas (air) surrounding it, so the highest it can get is between the edge of the atmosphere and space, since space is a vacuum and it won't float if there is no other gas. It has nothing to do with gravity being too weak. Or is there something I'm wrong about?"

Someone already corrected you about Pluto actually being very far from absolute zero, but there's another important point to consider.  Objects don't reach absolute zero anywhere naturally.  The cosmic microwave background radiation temperature is 2.7 K.  That means that even if you have an object truly in the middle of nowhere, far from any galaxy, so far away that you can't even see a single star by the naked eye, it'll still never get colder than 2.7 K, because that's the temperature that the glow left over from the creation of the universe will heat everything up to.  And that glow is omnipresent and everywhere.  It's really crazy and cool to think about.  We've achieved temperatures very closet to absolute zero in the lab, but that's through a combination of some really intense laser cooling methods.  Objects never naturally get that cold."

spaceporn,3d8shy,GuiltySparklez0343,3,Tue Jul 14 17:37:37 2015 UTC,"The ""brown"" comes from areas of sublimation where ice sublimates and leaves behind dust and other ""contaminants"" that color the remaining ice, which is why we have this huge brown equatorial region.  The rest of the surface is a bright butterscotch color, the area I desaturated a bit is an area of more recent condensation, as evidenced by its smoothness and uniformity and is more likely to be free of the contaminants mentioned earlier, which makes it a much brighter color though still slightly yellowish depending on how you level the contrast in the image.  I might be proved wrong though tomorrow once the high-resolution + color images start being released.  It's possible that the area that I desaturated was deposited by a different type of surface process that would leave its yellow-brown color.  We'll see tomorrow!"

spaceporn,3d8shy,autfag,74,Tue Jul 14 12:55:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the objects it images are much larger than pluto, and it has luxury of taking hours long exposures, in mulitple filters, then stacking all those together to form one image.

Pretty obvious why they don't use it i suppose. http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/solar%20system/pluto/1996/09/image/a/format/web_print/

spaceporn,3d8shy,clivepalmersleftknee,17,Tue Jul 14 14:32:36 2015 UTC,"To understand that you need to learn about the size of the celestial bodies you're talking about. An average sized galaxy can be around 40, 000 - 60, 000 light years across, and the amount of light that it produces and reflects back is tremendous, it's just huge, because of that larger ground based telescopes and space telescopes such as Hubble are able to collect a lot of light and produce such great quality images. Now, Pluto on the other hand is way too small, according to NH's updated data it's diameter is roughly about 2400 km, which is nothing as compared to even a dwarf sized galaxy or a nebula or even Earth, apart from that it is 4 billion km away from us, so you see the light reflected from Pluto is really less, result is that we get those blurry pixelated images.  But not anymore, in coming weeks we would be getting really amazing images from the encounter, couple of times better than this image here, all thanks to New Horizons."
spaceporn,3d8shy,JaggedToaster12,8,Tue Jul 14 13:21:00 2015 UTC,The simplest way that I heard it explained was that we can get super good pictures of mountains miles away buy can't even see a lone grain of sand up close.

These ominous figures are actually molecular clouds, knots of molecular gas and dust so thick they have become opaque. In comparison, however, these clouds are typically much less dense than Earth's atmosphere.  Pictured above is part of the most detailed image of the Carina Nebula ever taken where dark molecular clouds are particularly prominent. The entire Carina Nebula spans more than 300 light years and lies about 7,500 light-years away in the constellation of Carina.  NGC 3372, known as the Great Nebula in Carina, is home to massive stars and changing nebula. Eta Carinae, the most energetic star in the nebula, was one of the brightest stars in the sky in the 1830s, but then faded dramatically.

spaceporn,3d6wsv,thehalfwit,18,Tue Jul 14 06:41:03 2015 UTC,The probe can't simultaneously transmit data and collect it because it has to physically turn to align either its radio dish towards us or its cameras at Pluto and its moons.

spaceporn,3d6wsv,EineBeBoP,17,Tue Jul 14 08:23:33 2015 UTC,"Each other. The gravity from one pulls on the other, and vice versa. Think of it like two big magnets on a table -- Earth is a way way bigger magnet than the Moon, so it pulls the Moon toward it without budging.  Pluto on the other hand is not much bigger than Charon, so they both pull each other toward the middle point between them."
spaceporn,3d6wsv,tuckels,5,Tue Jul 14 08:44:02 2015 UTC,"So would a 3rd item be drawn down the gravity well to end up ""trapped"" between the two at this center of gravity?"

spaceporn,3d61fz,imaginedmind,7,Mon Jul 13 20:19:32 2015 UTC,"This is global color mosiac of the moon that was taken and put together in 1989 by Voyager 2 when it flew past the planet Neptune.  This is a partially false color image taken in orange (red in image), violet (green in image), and ultraviolet filters (blue in image).  For more info about the image, see its catalog page and here is the original TIFF file.  Triton is thought to be a captured dwarf planet in part because of its size, and also its retrograde orbit (i.e. it travels around Neptune in the wrong direction), which is generally a good indicator that the object was captured, as any moons that would have formed along the planet would have formed from the same disk of material rotating in the same direction.  For it to end up on a retrograde orbit it would have needed to suffer a huge collision or it would have had to have been captured on that orbit, and the evidence points more towards capture.    This essentially gives us the first ever look at a Kuiper Belt dwarf planet, and we may vary well see some of the same features on Pluto in the next few days, including:   Cantaloupe terrain, a mysterious bumpy terrain type that looks like the skin of a cantaloupe. Cryovolcanism, think volcanoes but ice and liquid nitrogen/ammonia/water mixture instead of basalt and lava. Dynamic resurfacing: ridges, valleys, walled plains all formed from the interaction of liquid/icy ammonia-water cryo-lava freezing, thawing, flowing, and freezing again, and possibly even plate tectonics. A layered atmosphere with condensed nitrogen clouds & a low altitude hydrocarbon haze"
spaceporn,3d61fz,branawesome,2,Mon Jul 13 20:36:12 2015 UTC,"These objects don't seem to have many craters, are they relatively unchanged since the formation of the solar system? What could/do they teach us about its formation?"
spaceporn,3d61fz,kburger91,3,Tue Jul 14 02:49:38 2015 UTC,"This is where the dynamic resurfacing comes into play.  Most of the craters you see on all solar system bodies were deposited early in the solar system's history during a period we call the heavy bombardment when Jupiter and Saturn were forming, growing in mass and interacting with each other and the ice giants gravitationally, tossing smaller stuff all around the whole solar system.  Once a surface gets cleaned up by some resurfacing process, it remains pretty devoid of craters aside from a few impacts every once and a while, rarely anything big.  The surface on Triton has remolded itself enough to rid itself of most of its craters.  The sublimation and condensation of ices is mainly responsible for this.  The cantaloupe terrain is another issue altogether.  We really don't know how that forms but clearly there is some surface-modifying process going on there as well, though that terrain is definitely older than the other regions of Triton with active resurfacing."

The Andromeda Galaxy, for example, is 3 billion times farther away from us than Pluto but it is 500 trillion times larger.

spaceporn,3cx7f6,sexual_pasta,40,Sat Jul 11 21:15:49 2015 UTC,"Valles Marineris isn't a canyon in your traditional sense - the main channels weren't carved through erosional processes such as dust storms, running water, or glaciers. It's a massive crack across the side of the planet.  The canyon system lies just to the east of one of Mars's other well known regions, the massive Tharsis volcanic plain, home to Olympus mons, Arsia mons, Ascraeus mons, and Pavonis mons. All massive sheild volcanoes with summits ranging from 14km to 21km. For comparison, Everest is 8.8km tall. Olympus mons alone covers an area the size of Colorado, and visibly distorts the horizon line.  Mars doesn't have any tectonic action, so when a hotspot formed (think like what built the Hawaiian islands), all the fresh magma was belched out into one spot, rather than creating a trail of smaller volcanoes. This isn't 100% accurate, as Tharsis took a damned long time to form, and Planetary scientists are still debating whether some mountain's positions are due to drift or the product of a large fault. The actual formation of these mountains is a pretty deep area of research.  All the added weight on the Tharsis region caused the surrounding surface to slowly buckle due to gravitational strain. Marineris is the largest of many rift vallies pointing radially outwards. A good terrestrial analogy is the East African Rift.  As a side note, the region's formation added enough mass to cause Mars's spin to become unstable, causing the axis of rotation to change in order to put Tharsis across the equator. It's also thought that Moon's interaction with the Earth helps to stabilize Earth's spin, potentially making it more habitable than if the Moon wasn't there."

I imported that into Unity, and hooked it up with a VR helmet (later the Oculus Rift when ours finally arrived).  Using room tracking we were able to walk around on the surface of mars.  The graphics weren't the best, and the terrain had the slight problem of abruptly ending where the data ran out, but I can say it was quite cool. Also, I hooked it up to a steering wheel, made a little buggy, and proceeded to drive off cliffs.  Very fun.  Wouldn't recommend trying with real rovers."

We live in a time where the policies of the Democratic Party are significantly to the right of Richard Nixon's.   There is all sorts of talk about the terrible waste of money that our government has when it comes to things like NASA, which is not even a drop in the bucket, but then spends trillions on an unneeded oil war and welfare for multinational oil companies. Those people that complain about the horrendous ways government spends their money never once bring up the 800 pound gorillas in the room.

spaceporn,3cvdq4,ITeachFuckingScience,7,Sat Jul 11 02:21:03 2015 UTC,Question: was Venus's orbital path shifted when it was stuck by another large body (and making it slowly rotate clockwise)?
spaceporn,3cvdq4,Gnomus_the_Gnome,11,Sat Jul 11 06:31:07 2015 UTC,"A massive impact has always been my suspicion, because I assume it initially spun the same direction as all the other planets at one point.  One popular hypothesis holds that Venus is still spinning the correct direction, but it's upside down. This could be attributed to a massive impact.  Another idea is that Venutian rotational rates decayed over time, then after a period of non-rotation, began going the opposite direction due to tidal forces from the Sun and planets.   It's a fair question, one that is asked by my students each semester when we get to Venus and its retrograde rotation.   And remember, it's incredibly slow, almost tidally locked to the Sun, but not quite!  EDIT: I realize now that I missed part of your question. I have no reason to believe that the orbital path itself was modified, only its rotation. Its orbit is the most circular of all the planets, which lends credence to the notion that it has always been in its current location.   Another fun idea is that Venus once had a moon, but it crashed into the surface soon after creation. I must admit, I'm not educated on this and have no opinion about it."
spaceporn,3cvdq4,Gnomus_the_Gnome,2,Sat Jul 11 06:48:52 2015 UTC,Thank you!  Would you mind if I asked a follow up question?   In the image it looks like Venus is not in the central plane that the earth is on. Is this the case?
spaceporn,3cvdq4,Gnomus_the_Gnome,2,Sat Jul 11 17:25:38 2015 UTC,"Great question!  All of the planets travel in a flat plane around the Sun, like marbles on a spinning record player. It's perfectly flat, right? Nope, it's got some variation.   At any given time, a planet can be ""above"" or ""below"" this plane, depending on where it is in its orbit. Same goes for us - we go up and down a little, too!   It's not much, mind you, but enough to give a little variation in our view of the transit. Back in 2004, Venus is seen here going across the bottom of the Sun, whereas the one in 2012 is going across the top.   By the way, our Earth is tilted with respect to that plane, shown here in this diagram.. You can see how the ecliptic is translated onto the disc of the Sun here.  So, the record player isn't perfectly flat. It's my understanding that the difference can be up to 10 degrees off the ecliptic.   The same goes for our Moon going around the Earth. Otherwise, we'd have eclipses every month!  Isn't it strange to think that the heavens aren't exactly perfect?  EDIT: Switched a link"

spaceporn,3cpiry,Firrox,7,Fri Jul 10 03:43:02 2015 UTC,"""Peculiar"" also means ""belonging exclusively to a particular thing"". It's a perfectly apt term.

spaceporn,3cpiry,Dantonn,2,Fri Jul 10 07:17:11 2015 UTC,"Personally I would have opted for ""True"", ""Absolute"", ""Pure"", or even ""Individual"" or ""Characteristic"" since ""peculiar"" has a double-meaning as strange, and lots of things in space are quite strange.  Don't get me started on quark labels."
spaceporn,3cpiry,Firrox,2,Fri Jul 10 14:24:01 2015 UTC,"Absolute and true have issues with implying a single ""real"" frame of reference (as does pure, though somewhat less so). Characteristic velocity is already a thing in rocketry and in any case suggests it's particular to a specific process, like characteristic radiation. Peculiar as strange, and for that matter ""strange"" in general (aside from the quark) are unlikely to show up in properly written scientific literature anyway.   As far as I can tell, individual would work quite nicely though.  Quarks are indeed weirdly named. I think they just went with two sets of semi-antonyms and the last two were the result of panic when they remembered they actually needed six labels."

spaceporn,3cf6y4,trm17118,51,Tue Jul 7 16:35:49 2015 UTC,They orbit a center of mass outside of Pluto.  It is close to Pluto though.  Here is a gif of New Horizons view back in January that shows the wobble.
spaceporn,3cf6y4,gaflar,9,Tue Jul 7 17:05:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, that really shows the off set of point of rotation. The original gif was centered on Pluto and the eccentric orbit of Charon (probably because it was not on a plane perpendicular to the observer) didn't help. Thanks for posting!"

spaceporn,3cf6y4,baudtack,3,Wed Jul 8 02:58:09 2015 UTC,So is it just charon pulling on pluto causing pluto to wobble like that or is there some mass right there that we can't see?
spaceporn,3cf6y4,graaahh,10,Tue Jul 7 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"My understanding is it's just the relationship between the two objects. It happens with all planets actually, the Earth doesn't technically orbit the direct center of the Sun. It's just the Sun is so large that the center of mass between the two is still WELL inside the Sun so it doesn't practically make much of a difference. Please correct me if I'm wrong."
spaceporn,3cf6y4,baudtack,14,Tue Jul 7 19:23:34 2015 UTC,Jupiter's barycenter is outside the edge of the sun a little bit though.

spaceporn,3cf6y4,Jose_Jalapeno,3,Wed Jul 8 06:58:55 2015 UTC,"Basically... yes, and yes.  When two bodies are orbiting each other, they are both circling the barycenter. When one is far more massive then the other, it can appear as though it is stationary and the other is just circling it, but that's not really true. This is even the case for tiny satellites orbiting the earth, or even individual dust particles, it's just such a tiny effect it is effectively unmeasurable.  Meanwhile, all these orbiting bodies interact with each other as well, and both cause and are affected slightly by all the wobbling and jiggling that everything does."
spaceporn,3cf6y4,the_life_is_good,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:24:22 2015 UTC,I think the pull from the other planets is so small that you can't really say the sun is orbiting a point in our solar system. The sun orbits the centre of the galaxy.

If you roll a pool ball around the edge and drop one in the middle, the one in the middle won't be square in the center because the one rolling around the outside deforms the trampoline. The trampoline is space-time, the pool balls are Pluto and Charon, and the deformation is kind of like gravity."

spaceporn,3cf6y4,SithLordDarthRevan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"I guess 'Centre of Gravity' is fairly ambiguous and should only be applied to one body. What I called the centre of gravity is technically 'the centre of rotation due to the gravitational attraction between the two objects', i.e. the Centre of Mass or the Barycentre (interchangeable terms if there's 2 or more bodies, otherwise it's just a centre of mass, as it appears a barycentre requires more than one object)"
spaceporn,3cf6y4,quastra,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:58:00 2015 UTC,"Center of gravity (usually interchangeable with center of mass) refers to the point on a object where an applied force does not cause the object to rotate. E.g. pushing a long pole near one of the ends will cause it to rotate, while pushing it near the center of mass will cause it to move without rotating.  Because physics, this also works out to be the location of the axis about which an object will rotate when not exposed to any forces."
