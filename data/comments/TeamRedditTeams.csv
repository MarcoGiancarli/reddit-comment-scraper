As Vayne - Passive Farming until mid game Previous ranked 5's experience: Played on an all diamond team (me being the exception as the only plat player). We played our placement matches, went 5/0, then the team fell apart because of conflicting schedules. In addition I played in a brief, one-night tournament with 4 diamond players and placed second. Won some RP! Communication Programs: Skype, Curse, Team Speak (Curse heavily preferred). Additional Comments: Because of my work schedule I need a heads up about what nights we play so I can be sure to be off on certain days of the week. This is only for the next month though until school starts (I'm in college) and I have more free time in the evenings. Also, I realize I'm not in diamond as of now, however I have a high win rate in solo queue and I doubt it will be long before I reach diamond 5. Plus, as noted in my past experience, I have played at diamond level 5s before and am comfortable with taking criticism and improving. I'm also very friendly, but won't hesitate to critique others if my opinion is asked (we all want to improve anyway!). Thanks for considering me!"

I workout in the morning before work (8-5 approx for summer, am college student) so the late nights of scrimming or practice might be the only reason preventing me to commit to a player role so as an analyst it MIGHT be able to be more flexible to review VODS and watch games on own time not necessarily in line with scheduled practice time.
