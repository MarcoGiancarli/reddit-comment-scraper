fountainpens,3e3tev,kindarusty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:08 2015 UTC,"Cool. I would be most interested in the interaction effects between a few of the questions. Is there a relationship between coded pen manufacturer and paper preferences; mediated by number of pens, age, or nib size.  I think this points to one area that the /r/fountainpens survey could do better: support multiple preferences. The downside of radio buttons for ""select the best"" or ""favorite"" type questions is that you reduce the expressibility too much. Often it's better to conduct the question as a ranking or ""pick top 5"" thing. That way you can do a pseudo-vote more fairly if lots of participants are more likely to have split preferences or no strong favorite.    This survey also brings up the question of whether it would be better to just do numeric age entry and some Likert scales instead of categorical things like ""favorite nib width: XF,F,M,B,BB."" I'd see a continuum between fine (with some mm measurement attached) and bold. That would be really interesting if you controlled for the kind of writing a person does with their pens (i.e. drafting vs creative writing vs notes) in your analysis. You can still bin these measures together into age ranges or general widths in post-hoc analyses, but it gives you more data to play with."

I wasn’t sure that it was the elusive rarity I thought it to be but now that I have the pen in hand I am certain it is the 2005 turquoise color VP.  It has a sparkle that is spectacular in real life.  Pictured with it is a Pilot Sesenta limited edition based on the Decimo body.  It’s from 2007 and was limited to 100 pieces.

It's not as flashy, but the chrome cap and blue barrel have a timeless look to them, and the nib is extremely reliable. I used it every day for notes in school and I had no complaints.

I also made the mistake of switiching them to 2 dollar noodler nibs which are just as inconsistent.  Still a great beginner pen."

It belongs to their Jewel line of pens, which was their line of celluloid pens at the time. Holland started making dip pens in the 19th century and continued to make fountain pens up until the early to mid 20th century. They have the dubious distinction of inspiring Parker to begin making his own fountain pens as Parker was tired of fixing his students' Hollands and decided that he could improve on them himself."

fountainpens,3e3eic,ppchromatics,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:00 2015 UTC,Make sure the tines are aligned.
fountainpens,3e3eic,JDAndChocolatebear,2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:50 2015 UTC,"Step 1: Alignment (see: YouTube). Step 2: Smoothing. If you don't have any specialty smoothing material (usually either micro-mesh or Mylar paper, something in the ballpark of 12,000 grit) you can totally smooth out pens using smooth glass to polish the same way you would with sandpaper. It turns out, glass itself (even glass that seems smooth to the touch) is eeeeeever so slightly abrasive. It might not get you ""writing on air"" levels of smoothness, but to take a pen from uncomfortably scratchy to easily pleasant, about half a minute or so of polishing on smooth glass (think scrap window pane, mirror, glass bottle, anything with a smooth-enough-to-be-reflective polish on it) will work wonders. :)"
fountainpens,3e3eic,OverWilliam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:05 2015 UTC,If the tines are out of alignment they will need to be adjusted back into place. If they are in alignment then you might need to look into micro mesh or Mylar paper to smooth it out. Look on YouTube for how to videos and they will explain it better.

Most coral inks are really bright - Diamine Coral, for instance, is the right hue, but sears.  (Which is fine, but not really reflective of your pictures.)  My favorites are Diamine Carnation, which is definitely more pink than orange, but a really underloved option, and L'artisan Pastellier Orange, which is a really soft orange that can go more orange or more pink depending on the paper.  I'd say L'artisan Orange is the closest to your pictures.   Diamine has a lot of pinky oranges or orangey pinks - check out Flamingo and Coral.  Sailor has some warm bright pinks that are kind of out of range - I like Ooji Cherry, which is from the Kobe ink line.  Peche has a soft pink feel, but is cool rather than warm; it can still work on some paper/pen combos.  Herbin Rouge Caroubier can work, but I don't love how dry it is.    Unfortunately, a lot of my suggestions are a bit self-serving, because my favorites aren't super available, but I do sell little aliquots of ink in the US (inkbytheml.squarespace.com).  If you find something else you love, let me know - I'm always on the look out for that one coral."
fountainpens,3e39va,Davrosin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:31 2015 UTC,I just ordered Herbin's Rouge Caroubier.  It's beautiful.  Diamine's Flamingo Pink looks absolutely lovely!  It may have to be a new purchase soon.

If something is too bright, try adding a drop or half-drop of a light grey (maybe Iroshizuku Fuyu-Syogun, Old Man Winter).  You can try black+water, but I've never done that, so I don't really know how that would work out...  If something is too dark, add water to lighten it up.  If you do this, write down what you do, EVERY tiny step of the way.  You might be doing half-drops at a time until you see something you like and by then you would have forgotten what you've done."

fountainpens,3e203r,neelhtaky,7,Tue Jul 21 10:02:15 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest looking into a pen with a higher ink capacity than your standard cartridge/converter fillers since you've said that you can run a cartridge dry in a day. Piston fillers and Vac fillers have much higher capacities.  For a piston filler, I'd suggest getting a Lamy 2000 ($160 from Goulet, but ~$120 from Amazon), or a Pilot Custom Heritage 92 (IIRC, ~$120 from Amazon through Japanese sellers).  A vacuum filler would have even more ink capacity. In your price range, I'd look at the Pilot Custom 823 (~$200 dollars imported through Amazon).   The Pilot nibs will run finer than the Lamy nibs, as Japanese nibs are known to do, so if you're looking for a fine line, the Pilot's EFs should do the trick."
fountainpens,3e203r,ProfUnderachiever,2,Tue Jul 21 10:33:44 2015 UTC,"The Custom 823 is not natively available with an extra-fine nib, jsyk. Unless OP asks the seller to swap nibs, which may be less feasible if they're importing from Japan.  I'd say if OP used a Cross fine the Pilot fine will be finer than that, no need to go extra-fine. Your suggestions for capacity are spot on, though I'd also throw in TWSBI Vac700 as a contender vac-fill. Seems like there's less issues with them than the Diamond series, so maybe it might be up OP's alley?"
fountainpens,3e203r,hiitan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:02:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry, wasn't aware the 823 didn't come in an EF. TIL. I agree, the Pilot F should be plenty fine for OP's needs, coming from a Cross F.  Also throwing in my vote for the Vac700 as well. I didn't recommend it in my original post since gold nibs would meet the springiness required in their criteria. But the Vac700 is an extremely solid pen, with a vacuum filler that comes at a fraction of the cost of an 823."

fountainpens,3e203r,NotClever,3,Tue Jul 21 18:15:37 2015 UTC,"In that price range, I would look at a custom pen by Newton or Edison. That way you can completely customize it.  I have a pen on order that I was able to customize to the nth degree, and it was right in that price range.  I chose the material, shape, size, clip/roll stop, filling system, nib and got an extra section to allow Esterbrook nibs, so it's a million pens in one and completely personal.  The only thing about it is filling system wise - you want something with standard refills - I am sure they can accommodate, but I elected for cart/convert with eyedropper capabilities."

If that's what you want, I would talk to Mauricio at vintagepen.net.  He has some flex nibs in Pelikan and TWSBI bodies. I have one, and it's great, but not the sort of thing I would carry daily.  I would worry about it, and I'm not usually a big worrier. I have used a cheap brush pen with fountain pen ink for some art with line variation, and it has worked well.  Otherwise, consider a custom pen maker. Most can custom-fit a nib, so if you know what you like, you can have a pen made to fit it.  If you don't want to do those, Franklin-Christoph carries some great eyedropper-converter pens. I've had good experiences with them.  An Indian pen with a different nib unit might cover your needs. Peyton Street Pens has some Ranga pens with Jowo (hard) nibs, but also some with old flex nibs. I've never used the latter, though, so I'm not sure what they are like.  Good luck in your search!"

fountainpens,3e05ix,VipKats82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"It is a little heavier than a fully loaded TWSBI 580, I like the nib, pretty smooth on Clairfontaine paper. It is a bit on the wetside even with a Fine nib so the shading isn't very pronounced.   By biggest peeve is the fact that the cap doesn't post very well thus it has to either be put on the side or pushed really hard into the back."

fountainpens,3e1jxv,jordanjay29,10,Tue Jul 21 07:01:33 2015 UTC,"My interpretation: Damage from other brands of ink (including other types such as India ink and calligraphy ink) will not be covered under warranty. For instance, if you feed your fountain pen India ink and it clogs, that's not a manufacturing defect.  They're probably trying to set reasonable limits on their warranty, albeit in a roundabout way that also promotes their own ink..."
fountainpens,3e1jxv,lesserweevils,3,Tue Jul 21 07:13:36 2015 UTC,"Pelikan also says the same thing and to an extent they are setting a reasonable restriction, not just for them but for you as well. Manufacturers test their pens with their own inks. Take Pelikan for example. Their pens are usually very wet writers and their 4001 inka are very dry. Most people are surprised at their new Pelikan's line width and most people dislike 4001 inks because they are dry. The thing is 4001 series inks are designed for Pelikan pens and they perform amazingly well in Pelikan pens. In such wet nibs the dryness is no longer an issue and the line widths are closer to their designations.  That doesn't mean you should only use the manufacturer's ink but be careful in choosing your inks. While boutique ink makers produce some great looking colors that are highly saturated that comes at a cost. A lot of lubrication is needed make the ink flow and because of that lubrication the ink can get to places where it isn't supposed to. I learned that the hard way.  I am a devout follower of Rick Propas's advice. Use only inks by established pen manufacturers or Diamine inks in pens you care about."
fountainpens,3e1jxv,canibanoglu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:47:52 2015 UTC,"So you don't use noodlers?  I mean I know they're controversial, but I don't understand why people don't like noodlers.

fountainpens,3e1jxv,canibanoglu,2,Tue Jul 21 14:14:36 2015 UTC,"Nope I don't use Noodler's but not because I won't use any Noodler's inks, I simply can't get them here. I'm very curious about Noodler's inks and I appreciate what Mr Tardiff is trying to do and I would love to support him in any way.   Having said that, I still wouldn't put a Noodler's ink in my fancier pens. I'm not saying this out of personal experience (obviously), it's just that I don't want to take any chances with my more expensive pens. Probably nothing would happen but if it something happened I would be pretty sad. That happened with Private Reserve Electric DC Blue and my Visconti HS Crystal and I intend to never make that mistake again."
fountainpens,3e1jxv,blackbird17k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:52 2015 UTC,"Well, look at it this way.  Say I have a Parker 51 (indeed I have a couple). I know that my Parker 51 will work fine with Parker ink, because people have been putting Parker ink into Parker 51's for 70 years. I don't know if there's anything in Noodler's that's going to screw up my Parkers, because it just hasn't been around long enough.  That's the issue, particularly with older pens. I tend to believe (whether justified or not) that newer pens are a little more versatile. For instance, I put Noodlers in my Lamy CP, which is my EDC, and it doesn't really bother me. I'm not sure what I would put in my Parker 51 that is a ""modern"" ink that would make me feel comfortable."

fountainpens,3dxv0e,Martinsimonnet,5,Mon Jul 20 23:44:12 2015 UTC,"Story time: I was browsing on our local craigslist and one seller was using pictures of others (photos of only a couple advertisements below his). I did send him an email about this cheesy advertisement. He was selling a Montblanc Boheme. We started emailing a bit and it was clear the guy just lacked technology skills. I received some pictures of the pen in order to help him to get the pictures to the advertisement. I initially wasn't interested until I heard his selling price --> 75 euros. He's not into pens and didn't know what to ask (he got 90 for a Cartier ballpoint a couple of weeks ago, selling the collection of the old man). The pictures weren't entirely crisp and clear, so I started reading about the Boheme and it's retractable mechanism. I also started reading about the fakes on the market and I was prepared in my opinion. The day after we meet up and he showed me the pen. It started looking at it and didn't retract at all! It opened it like any converter pen. I read there were some non-retractable ones once, but I was hesitant. Pix was present, the converter looks like the one I had in my 144, the weight felt okay, nib spring felt like a MB nib, nib imprints looked okay until I got below the starred M. 'Au'... dangit, I never saw that on a nib. The Stod (or something equal) was there. I was 85% - 90% sure it was a real one. After 10 minutes of thinking and searching on Google, I refused the pen. I didn't want to get a fake MB. After I left I continued searching on Google and after 15 minutes I found the answer. It was MBs new imprints, because they want to show the material of the nib. 'Au' is equal to gold in the periodic table. This made sense and I contacted the guy again. I could still buy the pen, so I got it. It's a really nice pen. The size is uncapped quite close to my 146 and the nib is hardly used. I think I'm keeping it or maaaaybe sell it to get a retractable Boheme. I'm an engineer and I love mechanisms like that.  TL;DR: Started emailing about his stupid advertisement, ended up with a new pen.  Does anybody have any info on this pen? I can't find much info on this one. It's probably not as popular as the Meisterstück series, but I really like it."
fountainpens,3dxv0e,typoglycemia,4,Mon Jul 20 13:06:04 2015 UTC,"I just hope it's not a fake, nothing pops out and it does seem genuine, best of luck.  The Boheme's have had 3 Lines,  Small retractable nib (Currently in production), Medium non-retractable nib, what you have and no longer in production, Large retractable nib (No longer in production).  All with or without gemstones in the cap."
fountainpens,3dxv0e,AmesCG,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! It feels like a genuine MB. I tested the nib with a magnet and it doesn't stick to the magnet.

fountainpens,3dx6mg,Blackllama79,23,Tue Jul 21 01:21:17 2015 UTC,"Appearance: 8/10  This is my 6th TWSBI pen. The TWSBI pen I love the most is 580 due to its design and balance. That 580 with fine nib is my daily writer. At first I bought this ECO to replace my 580. I didn't expect that it will be so beautiful. I thought it's a cheaper model and the barrel is not diamond shaped, so it may not look as decent as 580. I'm wrong. It looks gorgeous. The white cap and piston button make the pen very elegant. My only complaint is that the logo is ugly compared to other models in TWSBI product line.  Nib: 8/10  It's Jowo, it's stiff, it's wet, and it's smooth. Basically it's the same nib TWSBI mini uses. Some of my friends thought it's smoother than 580, however I don't have experience with medium nib on 580 so I can't confirm that.  Build: 9/10  I don't know if it's my delusion, but I feel it's more solid than 580. The piston is smooth like Pilot CH92, while I found 580's piston is a bit unsmooth.  Price: 10/10  This is twice more than I expected to receive for under $30. It's a no-brainer to buy. This price kills a lot of entry-level pens such as Lamy Safari and Pilot Metropolitan. Among all of my entry-level and high-end pens, this became a daily writer always in my pen case automatically.  Conclusion: Get one!"

fountainpens,3dx6mg,DeucesHigh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:54:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's horrible. From such an amazing crown on the Mini and 580 to this, is just disappointing. I guess it's called the Eco for a reason, but still. Other then the crown though, the pen looks pretty good."
fountainpens,3dx6mg,jordanjay29,2,Mon Jul 20 14:57:24 2015 UTC,"Mine came in on Saturday!  This is my first TWSBI pen, and I love it.  I got the white one as well, with a medium nib.  I'm not sure if I'm sold on the white color just yet, but too late =P    I had a few hard starts with the nib last night while writing, but by using the piston to push just a tiny bit more ink into the feed, that issue resolved very quickly.  It is VERY smooth.  This is my first non-Lamy pen and I love the nib design.  It's also my first demonstrator, and I love it.  The section was fairly greasy when I first got it, but some light dish soap took care of that.  In short, I'm super happy with this pen, especially for the $30.  I'm not sure if it's because of the nib/pen or what, but my Noodler's Navy ink looks a lot darker from this pen and doesn't shade the same compared to a medium nib on my Lamy pens.  Late edit: Also, I seem to smell my ink a lot more from this pen.  There seems to be a lot more nib creep though, so that's probably why."
fountainpens,3dx6mg,if0rg0t2remember,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:30 2015 UTC,"So now that you've played with it for a day, which would you recommend for a first TWSBI: 580 or ECO? I'm looking to jump out of the land of Preppy/Metropolitan, and the ECO hadn't even been on my radar because of its newness and lack of reviews."
fountainpens,3dx6mg,reubenco,2,Tue Jul 21 07:34:45 2015 UTC,"I would recommend ECO. If you feel 580 is better looking and worth extra $20 then buy 580. However, they don't have any difference in terms of writing experience. The only feature 580 has which ECO doesn't is changeable section. You can still buy a mini nib which is identical to ECO's."

The lesson I take away from this is to pour it carefully in the future and ignore labels.  One can choose to use syringes or pipettes, but the failure wasn't with pouring--pouring can still be done successfully, if done gradually."

It was my very first fountain pen that I bought when I started collecting about a year ago. MSRP is about $50, but can usually purchased at Staples for $20. It's a decent pen at that price range with a plastic body and chrome accents on the section(can get slippery). It takes cartridges, also available at Staples, or the push-in converter($8).  There are some major design flaws with the pen:  1) It can't be posted at all as the cap weighs more than pen itself.   2) The threads where the nib and section screw in are very flimsy and don't hold up to daily use.  3) The nib only comes in medium and is usable but can be very scratchy and experience hard starts on poor quality paper. Also, fibers really like to get stuck between the tines of this pen with use on below - average paper.  4) The finish on the pen also easily scratches and is very easily bent and damaged if dropped or mishandled.   Despite all this, it's a reliable pen with a gorgeous steel nib for the price and is a great intro pen for someone who prefers to see the pen before buying and is a great pen to practice nib tuning and grinding on."

fountainpens,3e1bip,Germanika,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:54:46 2015 UTC,I bought it the last time around on massdrop. It's a nice pen. I don't often have it in my rotation except for this month. But that's besides the point. The pen doesn't weigh a whole lot which is not indicative of quality at all. As with the Levenger L tech 3.0 it is a very nice writer. The medium nib is on the wet side but not overly juicy at all. This means that I run out of ink a little faster which to me isn't a deal breaker. The one thing I love is the design and finish of the pen. The twisted facets are quite nice even though they don't align perfectly from the body to the cap if you screw the cap on all the way. That's my one draw back. All In all it is not going to disappoint you if you purchase it. I bought it to ride me over until I save up some money for the Visconti Divina elegance

fountainpens,3dz2o3,KioraoftheWaterTribe,4,Mon Jul 20 18:19:34 2015 UTC,"If you want the smoothest nib, always go with the one that's more firm. When the tines spread, the tipping edges that normally almost touch will be in contact with the paper, providing feedback. I only own #5-sized soft nibs, but from my experience of smoothness: M>SM=FM>SFM=F>SF.  The soft nibs are nice to use for journalling where you don't need to write fast and have good ink-resistant paper. Softer nibs tend to lay down more ink and can catch paper fibers more easily, so I don't use them for notetaking in lectures.  I only own one #15 Pilot nib (on a Custom 823), and while it looks larger than the rest it is really not too much bigger than the #10 found in the 742, which can be found for about $100 cheaper. Also, the #15 is roughly about the size of a Pelikan M800/ Montblanc 146 and slightly larger than a standard Bock/Jowo #6 nib.  I hope that this helps!"
fountainpens,3dz2o3,songyiyuan,2,Mon Jul 20 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"Does the softness act as a cushion against rougher paper? I can understand how a firm fine would be smoother than a soft fine on good paper, but what about the rougher stuff?  I'm considering getting a custom 74/91 for note taking and I'm currently leaning on a SF."
fountainpens,3dz2o3,dxing97,4,Mon Jul 20 21:35:11 2015 UTC,"Quite the opposite, actually. On smooth paper, both will be similar as the tipping has nothing to catch on. But while firm nibs are still fairly smooth on rough paper, soft nibs will behave scratchy. Imagine taking a round ball and cutting it in half. A firm nib is like writing with the two halves closed together, while a soft nib is taking the halves apart and getting the sharp flat edge in contact with the paper as well.  I have a few vintage semiflex and full flex nibs, and they are extremely scratchy on rougher paper while something like a Parker 51 nib behaves well on pretty much anything.  If I could use only one (Pilot #5) nib for notetaking, I would probably go for a FM. Note that the soft nibs are significantly wetter than their firm counterparts, which may be troublesome if you like wet nibs or have cheaper paper."
fountainpens,3dz2o3,songyiyuan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:02 2015 UTC,"Do soft nibs write broader than their hard counterparts then? If so, maybe the standard medium #15 might work for me."
fountainpens,3dz2o3,songyiyuan,2,Mon Jul 20 23:09:02 2015 UTC,"At light pressure, they shouldn't write any broader, and don't expect consistent line variation as the soft nibs are by no means flexible. Since to achieve a consistent inkflow when pressure is applied, Pilot tunes this soft nibs to be wetter, which may make the line appear broader, especially if you paper is less than stellar and feathering occurs.  I personally love the #15 medium nib on my Custom 823. I only wish Pilot made a MB nib that was slightly broader than the medium but less so than the broad - something akin to an 18k Pelikan F."
fountainpens,3dz2o3,songyiyuan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:36:37 2015 UTC,Does that nib write somewhat fine then? My soft medium custom 74 is a bit broad for my tastes and if the medium 823 writes fine then it might be perfect.
fountainpens,3dz2o3,bemed,2,Tue Jul 21 00:46:27 2015 UTC,"I would say my 823 medium writes slightly finer than my 74 medium (neither are the soft variety). This may be due to me using my 74 for a few years, but also that the 823 writes a bit drier."

People love/hate the VP, and you could experience issues with the 580 that you don't want to have happen in the middle of a test.   Since you're likely to be writing on cheap, crappy copy paper (especially for tests), I'd go for a F or EF nib. Make sure you buy from a reputable retailer like Anderson Pens, Goulet Pens, or an Amazon-stocked (sold by: Amazon, not a third-party retailer on Amazon's storefront) listing so you have the right kind of buyer protection if things go wrong. You're a student, and your pen is your lifeline, you don't want it going bad in the middle of class.   But I can't imagine you'll have trouble with a Lamy 2000. Or a VP for that matter, but I don't recommend it due to the awkward grip."
fountainpens,3e0z4f,jordanjay29,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:23:32 2015 UTC,"Since you will be carting the pen all over the campus - you'll definitely want something durable and with a good ink capacity.  The TWSBI 580 will have the highest ink capacity, of the three.  The Lamy 2000 is going to be right behind that in ink capacity.  The VP has a very low ink capacity, compared to the other two pens - and I find myself refilling mine way more than I would like.  The TWSBI 580 writes great, and is a firm steel nib.  The Lamy 2000 writes great, and has a gold nib - but may require some tweaking (from my own experience).  (Best to buy from someone like Goulet or Nibs.com, and ask them to inspect the nib before shipping.)  The VP is also a gold nib, and smooth, but my least favorite writer of the three.  (Subjective preference on my part.)  The Lamy 2000 is, probably, going to be a little more durable than the other two (personal opinion based on my own experience with them).  The TWSBI 580 is great pen, and I carry one daily, along with a Lamy 2000.  I have already broken one 580 (twice) and a Vac-700 though.  But the same Lamy 2000 is still going - under the same conditions as the others.  So I would, probably, suggest the Lamy 2000 - simply for durability and ink capacity reasons. (Based only on my my own experiences with the three pens.) Then the TWSBI 580.  Lasty the VP.  Just my two pennies.  :)"
fountainpens,3e0z4f,ironhelixx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"If you are using it for college and want it to look understated, be durable, and use it for notes and homework, I would recommend the Lamy 2000 in EF.     The material is excellent and the pen is very durable. Furthermore it is a piston filler that is smooth and holds lots of ink. The VP hold much less ink and probably won't last you doing a day of notes and homework (unless you use the Con-20 or refill a cartridge and even then, the capacity is significantly lower).     The 2000 has a secure snap cap as well, so its easy to cap when your prof. starts rambling or cleaning the chalkboard and is easy to uncap. The hooded nib also helps because the ink doesn't dry out as easily which makes it able to keep up with quick handwriting."

TWSBI 580 is a solid work horse, Lamy 2000 is a bit questionable.. It's a great desk pen, but I'm just not a fan of the ink window. Vanishing Point.. Well I have three so clearly I'm a fan, but to me they're just jotters, I just use them to jot stuff down. I can't do long writing sessions with them.  My suggestion is a Pilot Custom be it the 74 or CH 92, they can be purchased for $80 and $120. The 74 is my favorite pen, feels amazings. Maybe the 74 over the 92 for the option to throw in a cartridge if you run out of ink in the middle of class. For the point alone I would get something that takes a converter.   Maybe a Pilot Custom 74, and a TWSBI 580 for about $135 on Amazon."

I like TWSBI, but a lot of their value is relative to the cost. They make some of the cheapest built-in-filling-mechanism pens around, but I wouldn't get one if I had your budget. Especially with the 2000 also being a piston-filler."
fountainpens,3e0z4f,heidingaway,0,Tue Jul 21 09:32:29 2015 UTC,"I would suggest a Lamy 2000 based on your needs with the caveat that they have been known to have nib issues especially in the extra fine area you are looking at. Just be aware of this possibility and perhaps go through a retailer that will test prior.   I personally use a Pilot VP, I think it's great for notetaking because the click mechanism is very convenient. I can stow away easily when the prof doesn't say anything interesting for a while, but need to quickly jump back in. Japanese nibs will also be finer and this pen works great on crappy paper.   I wouldn't recommend this pen just because you wanted the larger ink capacity. I can get through about 2 full days of lectures on one VP fill, which is 1ml if you refill cartridges. But for my program, 2 full days is about 3-4 hours of classes and I am not constantly scribbling."

fountainpens,3e011d,Mishellereine,2,Tue Jul 21 05:52:54 2015 UTC,If the tines out of alignment then they need to be gently pushed back. There are many videos on YouTube that explain how to do it. That's where k would look.  A loupe would be quite useful from goulet so you can see the alignment and know which way to make the adjustment.
fountainpens,3e011d,reubenco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:09:23 2015 UTC,So I should get a loupe and some brass sheets? Thanks!
fountainpens,3e011d,someincrediblebore,0,Tue Jul 21 00:24:13 2015 UTC,Definitely watch the video from Goulet about their loupe. Whether or not you end up using the thing (I agree with the user who said that a phone camera zoomed in is a reasonable alternative without having to buy something extra) it is a good overview of very basic nib alignment repair.

You get better pens because you become more skilled at finding bargains and knowing what makes a good pen.  ... Where ""a good pen"" is your definition of good: higher-quality materials, better balance, a more refined nib, or whatever you think makes a pen better. You get to know your own preferences.

I think it costed me in total around the 600 euros, but it was totally worth it. I just have a slightly bigger student loan now :P..  I own 1 grail pen (146), but the next ones are m800, something Japanese, one time I get myself an Waterman Edson. I don't want an 149 (too big) or an m1000 (okay maybe)...

fountainpens,3dyhk4,foamerfrank,5,Mon Jul 20 15:52:07 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on where you're coming from. If you've only ever used a Pilot Metropolitan or a Lamy Safari, I think the performance upgrade to a TWSBI is worth it. You get lots of features for a $30-$50 pen, and they do write well (for a Jowo nib pen).   The elephant in the room, like you said, is construction quality. Some do crack, yes. If you're looking for a pen that you're going to still be using in 50 years, don't get one. If you have an extra $50 to spend on a nice demonstrator that probably won't last more than a couple years, and you feel OK with that, then do it.  Personally, I own two TWSBIs, and love them both. It's all about setting expectations."
fountainpens,3dyhk4,Kronia,3,Mon Jul 20 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"if you're looking for a pen that you're going to still be using in 50 years, don't get one   I think the expectation that a pen in this price range should last that long is part of the problem. The Safari certainly isn't without its own set of issues with cracking, especially up by the clip.  I'm with you though, I love my TWSBI pens so far for what they are. Enjoyable pens with far more flair than they have any reason to at their price point. So far no problems with any of them, so I'm satisfied."

fountainpens,3dyhk4,Mishellereine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:18 2015 UTC,Twsbi always warranties their pens and has given good customer service in my experience. I have a 580al in purple and now an Eco on the way
fountainpens,3dyhk4,Silvire,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:37 2015 UTC,"It might not last more than a year.  Just search this sub for TWSBI and you'll find dozens of threads: TWSBI has great after-sales service, but absolute shit-durability products.  Take note I said shit-durability products, not shit products.  Their products are good. You get piston-fillers for a fraction of what any other piston-filler would go for on the market.  That said, the rose-gold plating on their pens wear out fast and if you want to replace it, it'll cost you.  Their pens suffer from multiple issues, including but not limited to, feed tube cracking and breaking,  nib unit threads breaking off, and more.  Their main after-sales guy, Phillip, usually responds with very good service when you highlight problems. In 90% of the cases. Sometimes he gets pissy and gives you attitude for manufacturer defects.  I speak from my own experience (I own a TWSBI 580 Rose Gold and a TWSBI Mini), and from the many, many, many stories I've read on this very sub."
fountainpens,3dyhk4,songyiyuan,8,Mon Jul 20 16:32:06 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I have to agree that you can't count on TWSBI for long-term reliability. I've owned three TWSBIs, a Diamond 540, a Diamond 580, and a Vac 700.   The first encountered three barrel cracking issues, two section cracks, and two cap replacements. I ended up assembling the few good spare parts and sold it. This all happened in a span of five months.  The 580, which supposedly fixed the cracking issue, had the cap/grip break in two spontaneously. This time, the replacement took a month and a half to come, and I really was put off by the quality and sold it again.  The Vac 700 has been in my possession for six months now, and while nothing has broken on me, small cracks have developed in the inner threads of the cap and are travelling along the length of the cap slowly.  I keep fairly good care of my pens - I don't baby them, but I am by no means abusive. By comparison, my Pilot Custom 823 of five years only shows microscratches on the barrel. Any of my Pelikans operate as smoothly as the first day I used them with only minor brassing on the plating. Running up on nearly 10 years, my Lamy Vista, while writing slightly broader than the first time I used it, is covered by hundreds of scratches, but operates flawlessly.   The only company with worse quality issues than TWSBI is Monteverde and maybe a few entry-level third tier pens (Hero, Jinhao, Serwex, Camlin, any ""schoolpen"" brand from China/India).  That said, I love the TWSBI philosophy of putting the user in control. Neither Pelikan, Lamy, Pilot, or any other semi-large pen company promotes user pen maintenance and none have even have the dedication to customer retention and satisfaction. I think the Eco is a great contender as a first decent pen and I do not hesitate to recommend it as one.  Does the Eco do anything spectacular that a seasoned pen user absolutely needs? No. If you own a Pilot Custom Heritage 92, Pelikan M200, Lamy 2000, or even a TWSBI Diamond 580, you will not see anything in an Eco that you don't already experience. If you want a cheap piston filler demonstrator as a second/third/fourth/n-th pen or you like tinkering with pens, the Eco honestly can't be beat as an offering from a reputable modern company. It's a no-nonsense pen for the masses, and it will settle into the fountain pen community much like the original TWSBI Diamond 530, the Pilot Metropolitan, the production line Edisons, etc."

fountainpens,3dyhk4,jordanjay29,3,Tue Jul 21 15:12:35 2015 UTC,"If you've read the previous posts, there isn't too much to add.  The Eco is new so no one has any idea if it will have any issues.  Everyone that has gotten one so far on here has said it was worth it.  Regarding various issues with the 580 and customer service, you'll have to decide for yourself whether you want to risk it.  There are people with opinions on both sides of the issue.  You'll just have to decide for yourself."

fountainpens,3dyhk4,if0rg0t2remember,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:47 2015 UTC,"Sure.  But nothing has changed.  I struggle with the same issue.  I like the look of the 580, but have been reluctant to buy one.  The Eco is that much cheaper, so perhaps I will buy one but the nib is different and it doesn't look as nice.  If you buy, assume it will break.  There's no guarantee that it will last even a year or two, as some people have had theirs break after a few months.  Some of that may be misuse, but it can't all be that, especially since these are experienced pen owners.  It seems you can assume you'll get a replacement after the first break, but customer service seems a little inconsistent.  For me at least, there will be no ultimate reassurance--you just have to decide whether to jump into the fray or not and hope for the best."
fountainpens,3dyhk4,rockydbull,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:14 2015 UTC,"Go for the Vac 700. Most of the issues happen (when they happen, which is rare) with the cap, and that's easily replaced and isn't going to leak or destroy the ability to use your pen like a barrel or section issue.   Also, the Vac is like the ultimate travel companion. It holds a ludicrous amount of ink, and you can seal the ink in the barrel for airplane mode. Unless you're literally writing pages every day, you could take the Vac on a week's vacation and not have to fill.   Solid recommendations for the Vac 700 all around."
fountainpens,3dyhk4,renegade_division,4,Mon Jul 20 16:00:42 2015 UTC,One might argue the eco is a safer bet because of the integrated section
fountainpens,3dyhk4,renegade_division,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:26 2015 UTC,"We just don't know yet. Truthfully it is only the 5x0 series with that issue. The Vac doesn't really have it because the threads for the section are on the section itself instead of the nib unit. So in theory the ECO shouldn't have the problem, but we don't know if it will have others."

fountainpens,3dytw8,jsolares,0,Mon Jul 20 20:27:59 2015 UTC,"I would recommend swapping nibs rather than going to a nibmeister if all you want is a broader nib. It's much less hassle.   If you insist on going to a nibmeister, then you'll need to have the nib retipped, and may very well cost more than just swapping the nib. Retipping involves arc-welding (I think) a ball of hard metal to the nib and cutting a new slit through the tipping material, then retuning the nib and feed for proper flow. The only nibmeisters that offer this service in the U.S. that I can think of are Richard Binder and John Mottishaw, and Binder closed shop last year."
fountainpens,3dytw8,dxing97,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:47:49 2015 UTC,"The DC Supershow is in mid-August if you happen to be around there. Shows are always a good place.  If you're trying to increase the broadness, I would recommend that you go for an F and then get it tuned. It could be a bit harder to make the XF much wider without removing a fair amount of tipping.  Otherwise tons of different people can do nibwork over the web. Check out Linda Kennedy, Binder (at shows), Masuyama, Mottishaw, and more."

It is free (other than shipping to them) and would be well worth it.  Trying to make an XF write like a F is a recipe for disaster.  You may find that you like the Pelikan factory F better (it will almost certainly have less feedback) and do not need to have anything done.  Try this before considering sending the pen for nib work.

fountainpens,3dwq1s,recordis17,3,Mon Jul 20 04:11:30 2015 UTC,"What is the main purpose of iridium tipping?   The tipping is an alloy bead of really hard metals (may or may not contain iridium) which prevents the softer gold or stainless steel of the nib from wearing down.    Is it something that is guaranteed to wear away with fp use?   Since the tipping is made of very hard material, it typically lasts for many many decades of constant use. However, depending on the paper you write, the tipping material quality and other factors, the wear will vary. But in general, tipping is very permanent though some users have mentioned that their pens do get slightly broader over time.    What would a flex nib (14K) write like without tipping?   No idea, it really depends on the geometry of the nib tip itself. But expect to see wear on an untipped pen so you might have to replace the untipped nib at some point.    How much does it cost to get a nib re-tipped?   It varies by provider but John Mottishaw of nibs.com charges $200 for retipping more specialized and flexible nibs.  http://www.nibs.com/PriceList.htm  EDIT: Changed name of nibmeister"

That's pretty much it.  Tipping usually doesn't wear away unless you've been grinding away at it for many, many years (someone correct me if I'm wrong). If you were buying really really old pens on eBay, there might be tipping issues, but I wouldn't worry about it too much. Some old pens are untipped, though.  The rest, I'm not too sure on. Good luck though, I hope someone else answers them for you soon."

fountainpens,3dwq1s,absolutenobody,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:09:01 2015 UTC,"Nah, I wouldn't worry about it. Tipping is hard to wear out. I have seen completely untipped gold nibs before, though, on 1930's pens."

fountainpens,3dwhnv,djungal,2,Mon Jul 20 05:58:04 2015 UTC,"The pen definitely feels higher up than most Chinese pens, but definitely not as premium as say the hundred dollar ones! Still, I would recommend this pen as a good step up from cheaper models. :)"
fountainpens,3dwhnv,recordis17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:07:18 2015 UTC,That thing is gorgeous! If it only took smaller nibs like Jinhao I'd throw a vintage flex nib on it.
fountainpens,3dwhnv,recordis17,2,Mon Jul 20 03:30:40 2015 UTC,I think it may work actually! It uses the same size #6 nib as other Jinhao pens.

fountainpens,3duyvp,prototypeplayer,7,Mon Jul 20 01:15:13 2015 UTC,Private Reserve Spearmint!
fountainpens,3duyvp,Ariastic,2,Sun Jul 19 19:01:51 2015 UTC,Seconded. My favorite green by a mile.
fountainpens,3duyvp,Turtl3Up,2,Sun Jul 19 21:14:09 2015 UTC,it is my shade of green 100%  Bright and saturated are two of my favorite qualities in ink.
fountainpens,3duyvp,clstearns,2,Sun Jul 19 22:39:35 2015 UTC,I like Waterman Harmonious Green. It's pretty well behaved and shades nicely.
fountainpens,3duyvp,DrStephenFalken,2,Sun Jul 19 19:26:47 2015 UTC,Noodles Army Green   Faber Castell Moss Green   Are my two favorites.
fountainpens,3duyvp,Icanjam,3,Sun Jul 19 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"My favorite is J Herbin Lierre Sauvage! It's quite bright yet it has a good tone, doesn't burn you eyeballs, and manages to show a bit of shading. For correcting paper I really recommend it because of it's brightness.  My next favorite is another J Herbin, their Vert Pre. It's a very yellowy, bright green and like the Sauvage ink is perfectly saturated. This is one of my favorite summer inks too as it reminds me of fresh cut grass!  Next I like Diamine Meadow. It's pretty close to the Vert Pre but is a bit darker and I think has a bit more yellow undertones. I don't actually have a bottle of this because my two J Herbins have most of my greens covered.  Last I also like De Atramentis Lily of the Valley. It's very similar to the Lierre Sauvage in tone but is much much more subdued. If the J Herbin is two bright but you like the color this is a good bet!"
fountainpens,3duyvp,DameEmma,2,Sun Jul 19 21:39:10 2015 UTC,Another vote for Lierre Sauvage.
fountainpens,3duyvp,TCP_1010,3,Mon Jul 20 19:15:56 2015 UTC,"For a nice, clean emerald green, I heartily recommend Norwegian Wood from Bung Box. If you're in the US, I believe there is some in stock at Vanness Pens.  If that's not an option, I think Montblanc's Irish Green or GvFC's Moss Green are excellent. You might also check out Diamine's Sherwood Green."
fountainpens,3duyvp,scalablecory,2,Sun Jul 19 19:04:39 2015 UTC,Here's a second for Bung Box Norwegian Wood.  I've tried out a number of green inks and it took a long time for me to find one I really enjoy.
fountainpens,3duyvp,snawklakl,2,Sun Jul 19 21:52:20 2015 UTC,"Diamine Kelly green is my favourite ink, would recommend."
fountainpens,3duyvp,NormalVector,2,Sun Jul 19 22:47:58 2015 UTC,"I really like Iroshizuku Syo-ro.  It has great shading but is more on the lighter green side.  It actually goes down blue but turns to green as it dries, kinda neat.  I have a pen filled with a sample of Private Reserve Ebony Green and I like it so far.  Again, great shading and it's more on the dark green side."
fountainpens,3duyvp,aeberbach,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:31:46 2015 UTC,"I do like Platinum ""Mix-Free"" Leaf Green. It is perhaps not as fancy as some of the other inks mentioned but you can adjust the color - one bottle of Leaf Green and one sampler kit from Goulet and you will be able to make just about any green you like. Its physical properties are very friendly. Little to no creep, dries quickly, flows well."
fountainpens,3duyvp,GuitarBizarre,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:23:51 2015 UTC,"Montblanc Irish Green and Diamine Meadow are very intense greens, a little darker than average but nowhere near black, and are both available and affordable.  People recommending Iroshizuku are perhaps underestimating the value of an economical option for a longterm workplace use, but Shin-Ryoku is very nice, if a little blue-green."
fountainpens,3duyvp,Smithwick_GS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:42:09 2015 UTC,"I sampled a few green inks before settling on one and now my goto green is De Atramentis Petrol.

fountainpens,3dvt8w,ashleysuxlol,5,Sun Jul 19 23:14:39 2015 UTC,"Going from the bottom up, they appear to be a Sheaffer No-Nonsense pen (an inexpensive pen), an Esterbrook (I believe it is an SJ, the smaller model), and a nice Sheaffer Targa, which looks to the the model 1005, a gold-plated ""Fluted"" pattern. You can see the latter at sheaffertarga.com and look under the ""Reference List"" link. Nice to have those pens, they should all write well once they are cleaned and any restoration done."

You can get ""some"" line variation, don't push it, and the feel on the paper is a bliss.  On the other hand, I've heard that the Sailors are awesome.

fountainpens,3dtfbx,vermilions,4,Sun Jul 19 07:38:01 2015 UTC,"I've got a black one, so I can't comment on the red.  I have the SF nib, and it is pretty heavy on the feedback.  I honestly can't imagine using the SEF nib (this is on Rhodia paper as well).  I think the black is more universally appealing than the red, personally, so if you're not sure, get the black.  The red is still fairly unique though!  EDIT: Okay, so it's been a while since I've used my Falcon.  Out of curiosity, I inked it up and gave it a go.  It's still much smoother than a ballpoint, and does offer feedback, but it isn't as bad as I remember it being.  It's not as smooth as a regular medium nib, but it's certainly workable.  It does tend to lay down a thicker line with the flex, so just keep that in mind.  If you write very small, it may not be the best nib for you, but I think the SEF would definitely be workable."
fountainpens,3dtfbx,NoNumberUsername,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:48:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your reply. I think the red looks quite unique, just not sure about the ink combos.

fountainpens,3dtfbx,skeptical_cheminal,2,Mon Jul 20 05:29:49 2015 UTC,"I have a red resin Falcon. I would guess that the color is between fire engine red and apple red. It's currently inked with Iroshizuku Kon-Peki and both compliment each other well. I haven't tried any other ink so I can't say how different colors will go with it but I'm pretty pleased with my ink/pen combo.  I also have a SF nib and the only time that I have paper fibers catch on the nib is when I write on really cheap paper. Writing on Rhodia or any similar premium paper is very smooth. It's finer than the TWSBI Mini F, though a tiny bit broader than my Pilot Prera F. That said, I feel that I get good line variations with added pressure and flex.  I wasn't planning on getting the Falcon in red; however, it was gifted to me and I absolutely love it. It's flashier than any other pens I own and I think the color adds a bit of uniqueness to the pen (in addition to the way it writes)."

I'm not sure whether the color of the barrel will get more attention than the fact that it's a fountain pen - even when I'm using my Metro or Prera, people will notice the nib and wow and gush over that.   If you're taking it to work or somewhere that other people can have access to, I would recommend keeping it with you at all times or locking it up. I know there are lots more expensive pens out there but personally I think it's also too valuable to have stolen or lost. I would imagine the red color could attract more attention because it would stick out from other ordinary pens. That said, I don't think you could go wrong with either color - the pen writes beautifully and if you end up getting one, have fun!"

fountainpens,3dqj9j,flexorhallucis,16,Sat Jul 18 14:02:44 2015 UTC,"""x-post"" from FPN  So today, a little package from India arrived on my doormat; slightly unexpectedly, but only because it was nearly two weeks earlier than anticipated!  The packaging was very secure, with a thick outer envelope, double layers of bubble wrap, a plush velvet pen sleeve and finally cellophane over the pen itself; I'm pleased to say it survived the trip from India to the UK entirely unscathed, and as a bonus fit neatly through the letterbox! Mr. Subramanian of ASA Pens was very communicative and helpful, with emails on receipt of the order, processing, and on dispatch.  No faults at all with the postage and dispatch!  First impressions: this is a Big Pen.  Capital B Big.  As in, if you thought the Noodler's Neponset was large, this is bigger.  Despite this, the pen is pleasantly lightweight for the size and, when filled, balances at nearly the exact midpoint of the length making for a comfortable writer without undue fatigue.  Construction: the pen is made of clear acrylic resin throughout.  ASA Pens' website states that the pen is entirely hand-turned with no CNC involved, and I have no reason to doubt them; the contouring is smooth throughout and the pen sits very nicely in the hand.  The section, cap jewel and end of the barrel are crystal clear, and the barrel and cap are sanded with micromesh to give a pleasantly textured, misty, fogged finish that feels surprisingly warm to the touch for some reason!  This is, of course,  where the pen gets its name; the nebulous fogged finish gradating into the crystal acrylic like the a galaxy into the vastness of space.    The threads are solid throughout, with the section taking over 11 full turns to unscrew from the barrel! Not coming loose any time soon :P The cap smoothly and firmly screws on in a little over 2/3 of a full rotation.  The nib and feed are friction fit, and took a little tinkering to rearrange for optimum writing, but are easily removable for cleaning etc.  The trim is chrome throughout, with a very stiff clip: not that this is a pen one would be likely to carry around in a pocket!  Stamped (lasered? engraved? heat-embossed?) on the side of the barrel is ""ASA Stellar Galactic / India 2015"" - this branding is next to invisible when the pen is empty, but shows up once the barrel is filled with ink.    Weight:    Capped: 31.0g empty Uncapped: 20.5g empty Cap: 11.0g   Dimensions:   Length capped: 15.3cm Length uncapped: 14.0cm Length posted: don't even bother... Barrel diameter: 16mm at the widest point Section diameter: 13.5mm in the middle of the taper   Nib and feed: my pen came with a standard unbranded IPG nib, with a fairly fine point.  There is an option to upgrade to a JoWo nib at checkout for a small extra cost, but I didn't feel this was necessary and indeed the standard nib is smooth with a little more springiness than my other steel-nibbed pens.  I believe the feed is ebonite (?), and it easily keeps up with even the fastest of my writing without flinging ink everywhere!  On the subject of ink, I measured the volume of the barrel to 1mm below the section threads as 4.1ml, over double the ink capacity of any of my other pens! You could write for days on end with just one fill of this pen.  Writing: the pen is a pleasant writer, especially for those with larger hands (like myself!). It's nicely balanced and easily long enough to use comfortably without posting, and frankly the length gets a little absurd if you were to try! The nib is smooth enough to be unnoticeable during writing, and is fairly forgiving of changes in angle.     Thoughts and opinions:  for a handmade pen that cost me a hair over £20 (Rs ₹ 1,050), including free shipping halfway across the world, I'd say the ASA Galactic is exceptional value for money.  If you like demonstrators, big pens, or just fancy something a little unusual, then this could be a worthy addition to your collection.  It's great fun to be able to see the huge ink reservoir sloshing around, and the clear section gives a good insight into the capillary action that feeds the nib! However, for people who prefer a smaller or lighter writing instrument, this isn't the one for you I'm afraid.    Now for a few pictures!  Showing the texturing of the barrel and cap, with a little glimpse of the logo.  Another view of the unfilled pen showing the engraving.  Nib on show!  Note the clear section.  All filled up woth Röhrer & Klingner Alt GoldGrün  Look at how that crystal acrylic blends into the fogged barrel!   And all filled up.  There's a little breather hole in the cap in case you didn't notice earlier.  A capped size comparison with (left to right) the Noodler's Neponset, Jinhao 159, TWSBI Vac 700, LAMY Safari, Platinum Century, Noodler's Ahab, Pelikan M600 and Kaweco Sport   And the same, but posted! See what I mean about the length getting a bit ridiculous?  Finally, a little writing sample.    I hope this little review has been of interest; ask away of you've got any more questions about this lovely pen!"

fountainpens,3dqj9j,TrampledbyHeffalumps,3,Sat Jul 18 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, number 6 (or close enough!)  To quote Fuellerfuehrerschein from FPN, who answered this far more eloquently than I would have been able to;  ""The feed is made of ebonite/hard rubber and has a diameter of 6.35 mm (¼ inch). The OEM Indian F nib is a № 10 Iridium Point Germany that is size wise practically a German #6 nib equivalent. The German #6 nibs are curved for 6 mm diameter feeds however. I have this OEM Indian № 10 F nib on another Indian ebonite pen. To get rid of vexatious scratchiness on the inverted side I had to remove tipping metal and do some polishing on my OEM Indian № 10 F nib.  Ebonite feeds can be heat set to perfectly fit a particular nib within limits. Since you wrote the pen can be ordered with a German #6 JoWo nib, you can assume German #6 nibs will fit this pen after heat setting such a nib and feed."""

fountainpens,3dt1za,todd_rules,-1,Sun Jul 19 08:01:10 2015 UTC,IIRC 580 is a #6 and a Eco is a #5   Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
fountainpens,3dt1za,DrStephenFalken,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:43:15 2015 UTC,580 is a #5 and the Eco is whatever the Mini uses.  The Vac700 is a #6.

fountainpens,3dt1za,jordanjay29,-3,Sun Jul 19 19:58:20 2015 UTC,"No (to elaborate: I saw somewhere that the Eco was not designed to have interchangeable nibs, because this was one of the main ways that TWSBI cut the costs on this pen. Now, that could theoretically be hacked, another nib could be forced in even if it's not designed to be, but even if that is the case it would be a Mini nib, not a 580 nib. The 580 has a totally different size nib.)"
fountainpens,3dt1za,reubenco,5,Sun Jul 19 05:04:34 2015 UTC,"No (to elaborate: I saw somewhere that the Eco was not designed to have interchangeable nibs, because this was one of the main ways that TWSBI cut the costs on this pen.   The nib in the 580 can be removed from the feed collar and is friction fit as well.   Now, that could theoretically be hacked, another nib could be forced in even if it's not designed to be, but even if that is the case it would be a Mini nib, not a 580 nib. The 580 has a totally different size nib.)   Mini and 580 nibs are both #5 nibs (important in terms of the friction fit). The 580 has larger shoulders near the top of the pen, but that is beyond the friction fit. The mini and the 580 can be interchanged no problem. What one must watch out for is that the nib does not bump up against the cap in the mini. Considering the size of the eco I do not think this will be a problem."
fountainpens,3dsugg,jordanjay29,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:09:29 2015 UTC,"I really like this pen and the Windsor. I'm thinking about focusing more on classic cigar-style pens, and I may have to find a couple of these."
fountainpens,3dsugg,fuck_bestbuy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"Compared to the Windsor, this pen is much more ornate. But I think the Windsor is a bit more Pelikan-ish, and the cap posts too deeply to affect the piston. This pen posts so that the cap touches the piston, so I have to be careful not to rotate the cap when I pull it off.   Both nibs are springy steel, though, and will give a small bit of line variation with light pressure. They're not full flex, and they're not even the semi-flex of the Noodler's pens (I can't possibly push them that far) but they take less effort to push the tines apart and that makes for a comfortable writing experience.   Most of the recent eBay postings for the Windsor are pretty expensive, ideally one can find a pen for ~$30-40. I might have opted for one of the marbled versions if I had known about them, those look very pretty and would make up for the Windsor's less ornate trappings."

fountainpens,3dryo2,Jollyrogr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:52:33 2015 UTC,"I've been interested in this pen, but couldn't justify spending $50+ when I already own two Metros. $20 would've sealed the deal for me, though.  How would you compare the writing experience with the Knight to the Metro? (I imagine they have pretty much the same nib, but it would be more interesting if I were wrong.)"
fountainpens,3dryo2,Jollyrogr,2,Sun Jul 19 01:40:22 2015 UTC,"Their performances are very similar. However I would say that the Knight's nib is a bit more scratchier, which I actually like, but they are both at the same level of dryness and they are both smooth writers for the most part.   I read a lot of people saying how the Knight baby bottomed and that it took some breaking in for it to write well but it wrote wonderfully right out of the box for me. If you can find a good deal on it, I think there's a website that's selling it for half price, or can get it cheaper on eBay, I really recommend it!"
fountainpens,3dryo2,Canthros,2,Sun Jul 19 03:18:22 2015 UTC,"Pilot mediums are very fine.  The pen looks alot like a metro.  I bet the nibs, feeds, and sections are interchangeable if you really want a fine nib.... I wish pilot would sell nibs"
fountainpens,3dryo2,Jollyrogr,2,Sat Jul 18 23:47:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, Japanese mediums are pretty fine and I actually own a metro myself. However, my metro is a medium as well. What I like about the knight is that the words are engraved in the nib rather than being scanned on there like the metro. They are very similar nibs so interchanging them doesn't seem far fetched."
fountainpens,3dsp3e,snuvy,8,Sun Jul 19 02:12:14 2015 UTC,"The only thing you need to be aware of really is that the pen looks like it has metal accents and cap band, but it doesn't.  Those are plastic.  The cap band being silver colored, textured plastic is particularly annoying.  But that quibble aside, the pen is great. It looks great and writes wonderfully- my SO has the one in Purple Orchid.  Whether or not it is worth it to me depends entirely on the price- I don't think it is really justifiable at like $125 or whatever retail is, but if you can find it around the $75 mark, give or take, it makes a lot more sense."

I actually like the design, but am turned off by the price considering it is a steel nib from cross (not known for quality nibs). Cross generally puts out about average pens, which might be ok at lower prices, but 100+ range is fierce.   For that kind of money I would look to one of the 150 edisons goulet sells. There you are getting a hand tuned steel nib and a pen with high qc."

It's always a reliable writer, no leaks ever. It has got a few scratches and scuffs, but nothing too bad. I can't find the Kaweco converter anywhere here, so this pen has always been cartridge-only for me.  Recently, I also purchased an ASA Swan from ASA Pens. It has replaced the Kaweco Sport as my pocket pen now. It's made of white acrylic; I can't yet comment on it's longevity with respect to the Kaweco Sport, but it seems durable enough.

I have owned my pen for quite some time now, perhaps almost a year, and its been through more than a lot.  Its been jostled in my pocket to oblivion. My other plastic pen then I carry with me has scratches all over it, but the CP1 bears a soft sign of age. Its not repulsing, but it carries a sense of age and reliability. The axle-mounted clip still functions as it first did when I received the pen. The bonus from this pen is that you can interchange the nibs, anywhere from EF to B and beyond. Its a slim pen, hardly thicker than a woodcased no.2 pencil. The lacquer seems to hold up extremely well, unless you use the CP1 as a wrench in car mechanics.  But the question does remain - what are your preferences? I do like having a slim pen with me, so I use the CP1 everywhere. But its often rather plain to most people. I don't care too much with regards to styling, but its often up to you...  I don't have any experience with the Cross Century though, but it seems to be a slim pen too. It seems that the nib sizes only range from Fine and medium, so you may be limited. But the form of the pen looks fairly well rounded."

fountainpens,3drcot,coasterfan55,7,Sat Jul 18 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"Lift up on the lever, not forcing it. If it won't give, and especially if you hear cracking or crunching, the sac has dried out and will need to be replaced. If it is pliable and you are able to move the lever, try filling it with plain water (not ink) and then expelling it. If the sac or any part is going to leak, better water than ink. After that, you could dip just the nib into some ink to see how it writes.  Having said all that, if the pen has not been restored in very recent years, you'll probably want to replace the sac anyway, because if it is original, it will fail. Simple process, many people can do it for you, if you are careful and handy you can do it yourself for only a few dollars.  Skylines clean up and restore better than almost any pen from that era. They did a good job of plating, though you need to be careful because the plastic of the barrel can become a bit brittle with time passing."

fountainpens,3doqfv,figboot11,18,Sat Jul 18 00:29:31 2015 UTC,"Here’s my initial thoughts on the ECO.  It’s a solid pen.  The section is unique from anything I have previously purchased.  The section is round, but at the tip, there are three flat parts where your fingers would fit if you use a triangular grip that goes down to the very end of the section.  The finial is solid plastic rather than the clear bubble of the Diamond 580.  The cap is about the same size as a 580, but the body is actually a couple millimeters longer.  It posts deeper on the body, as opposed to the 580 that posts on the piston.  I twisted the cap when posted and it did not engage the piston.  The nib is slightly smaller than the 580’s, but is very smooth, with an appropriate amount of feedback in my opinion.  The 580 is one of my favorite pens in my collection, and these two ECO’s will definitely get into the rotation as well.  So far, I’m very pleased with them."

fountainpens,3doqfv,spanthe_ocean,4,Sat Jul 18 02:13:47 2015 UTC,"The clip is on the tight side.  Definitely tighter than the 580.  It post very well.  I prefer to write with a pen posted, and while I love my 580, the way it posts on top of the piston always had me nervous I would twist it by accident when posting/unposting.  The ECO posts deeper on the body, past the piston, so it doesn't feel like it's just hanging off the end of the body like the 580 can feel.  The deeper posting also helps balance the pen out, so it doesn't feel back-weighted.  I don't have a scale, but overall, it's a rather light pen."

It was announced a long time ago and was delayed several times, and there was a great deal of speculation about and anticipation for this pen. So now it's very exciting that they're out. The special thing about is that they're just about one of the cheapest piston-filling pens you'll find out there, at $28.99. Piston-filling pens (which have a mechanism built in to draw ink from a bottle and don't need a cartridge or converter) tend to be more expensive than cartridge/converter pens (like your Safari)."
fountainpens,3doqfv,if0rg0t2remember,5,Sat Jul 18 02:11:01 2015 UTC,"This was asked, but not answered in the other thread, so I'll ask it again here:  It looks like the section and barrel of the ECO is all one piece--is that correct? In other words, the section doesn't unscrew from the barrel, making it much more difficult to fill with syringes. That would be a little sad, though at this price point, definitely not a dealbreaker.  I love the clear section, though--seeing the ink move by capillary action on my Safari is one of my favorite parts of that pen. I wish more manufacturers didn't use opaque nib units inside of transparent sections (e.g. Kaweco, Conid, all other TWSBI's).

fountainpens,3doqfv,Mishellereine,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:06:37 2015 UTC,YES! I have thought of this many times. Do you know of any currently produced transparent feeds other than the Platinum Cool and the Pilot Petit series?  I would love it if other demo manufacturers would do this.
fountainpens,3doqfv,Mishellereine,2,Sat Jul 18 16:35:46 2015 UTC,The Marlen Aleph had a transparent feed...

The section insert isn't transparent though. The Pilot Custom Heritage 92 has a mostly-transparent section.

It  will have to be dipped in the ink to fill. I too fill all of my pens via syringe so this will be different. Might actually finally decide what ink to put in my ink well.

I will say that after writing with the ECO for a while, the only negative I have is that I'm not a fan of the raised bits on the very end of the section.  There are times I will have to alter my grip so that it is more comfortable.  If you hold the section at the very end, you are forced to a specific grip, and with the section being a bit smaller, maintaining that grip can be a challenge at times...at least for me it has been."

If that's the reason, as long as you know about it, you can avoid the cracking completely. Also, the Ecos nib is friction fit, so it wouldn't have cracking at all.  Im pretty confident it's the reason, but it's always good to play it safe and wait a while."

Sometimes inks will react with each other. You can get precipitate or sludge or other unwanted stuff, so the suggested practice is to mix the ink in a separate container and keep an eye on it for a few days. If nothing happens then it's probably okay to use.  I don't know anything about Dollar inks, but especially with ink brands like Noodlers that have lots of different properties, mixing could be a gamble.

fountainpens,3dp35l,hiitan,2,Sat Jul 18 04:06:32 2015 UTC,"My understanding of Dollar inks is that they have a fairly small range of colours, so I'm guessing the inks are pretty similar in structure and shouldn't react negatively together... I should've included in my comment that, while applicable in general, these warnings are particularly important for mixing different brands and special properties (waterproof, etc).   Still, keep an eye on the ink in the converter (or did you refill a cartridge?) and if you see chunks or anything suspicious take the ink out and clean the pen thoroughly. Bonus, with the Metros you can take them completely apart so you can give it a really good scrub if needed. I think you'll be fine, though.

fountainpens,3do9eo,SuperShyChild,7,Fri Jul 17 22:02:17 2015 UTC,I think Yama-Budo leans more pink/magenta than Oku-yama. They are both wonderful inks. I prefer Oku-yama because it's a bit darker and sheens more.

I think I'll buy either J.Herbin Larmes de Cassis or Diamine Amaranth as they seem similar to Yama-Budo but for a much lower price.

fountainpens,3dnhti,Sun_Queen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:28:48 2015 UTC,is that your pen case?   if so how do you like the pilot e95s? I really want one but it seems like not a lot of people have them
fountainpens,3dnhti,HansSachs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:22:57 2015 UTC,It is my case but I do not own an e95.  What I have is the original Pilot Elite that the current pen was modeled after.  It is a very compact pen that when posted works well in my hands.  The nib has a bit of spring to it and writes with a very smooth extra fine line.  I have yet to try the E95 but if it performs as well as the original you would be pleased with it.

Wasn't part of the ""deals,"" but for an 18k nib and blue with gold trim, I had to go for it. Found it for $99 sold by Amazon. I wasn't sure I was ready to spend that much on a pen, but I used my credit card rewards points. Not a single cent out of pocket. Score!"

fountainpens,3dnhti,seeshawn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:42:35 2015 UTC,I've only used it for an hour or so but its butter smooth. I have to put just a touch of pressure on it on the first stroke of a word sometimes and it squeaks just a tad. I think I'm going to try to smooth it a bit if it doesn't clear up after a week or two of writing.
fountainpens,3dnhti,ExtropianPirate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"I've noticed the squeaking a bit, too, and while it does nothing to detract from the overall experience, I'm going to chalk it up to my having a medium nib.  For my next VP (can't believe I'm already saying those four words...) I'll likely get a fine nib.  I know /u/dannzeman was a fan of the fine nib in his Inksmith review, so it'll be on my list a few pens down the line."
fountainpens,3dnhti,penpapernovel,3,Fri Jul 17 22:50:09 2015 UTC,A VP was my first higher end pen purchase and it got me hooked. I just sent my M nib to have it grounded into a Stub.  Should have it back early next week.

fountainpens,3dmpq6,md81544,6,Fri Jul 17 15:02:01 2015 UTC,"I think part of the ""thickness"" you're talking about is because of the paper you used being really absorbent, or it looks like that at least. I don't want to force you to buy anything but you should give some higher quality paper a try if that thickness is too much of a bother. You could also just switch nibs as you said, to a finer one. I've only been doing this stuff for a few months myself so if anyone finds anything i said wrong feel free to correct me"
fountainpens,3dmpq6,se_raustin,3,Fri Jul 17 15:19:30 2015 UTC,I agree with Lord N IV - the paper looks too absorbent and you're getting feathering. Try getting a pad of writing paper or a Red 'n' Black Pad (a good brand for fountain pen-friendly paper) from your local W H Smiths and try that before you think about swapping nibs!
fountainpens,3dmpq6,greetingsmoto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:28:50 2015 UTC,I concur in all points. Red n' Black is my paper of choice in notebooks and pads. The performance:price ratio is outstanding.

Some of the more famous stores here for fountain pens are places like the Vancouver Pen Shop, Perks Pens, or even Paper-Ya and Nikaido. None of them carry the Falcon to my knowledge.   You'd probably be much better off purchasing from online shops as an import from Japan, it'll be far more cheaper! Try places like Engeika, J-Subculture, or even Rakuten!

fountainpens,3dnma9,bsteinke3,9,Fri Jul 17 19:26:50 2015 UTC,"Despite spending (oh so very much) money on a variety of pens, from the super-cheap to the slightly more expensive, I gotta say: the Metropolitan and the Safari are the BEST everyday use fountain pens I've ever used. No-one else comes close."
fountainpens,3dnma9,grubiwan,6,Fri Jul 17 19:41:19 2015 UTC,Could it be because of the snap on caps?

fountainpens,3dnma9,fuck_bestbuy,3,Sat Jul 18 02:44:54 2015 UTC,"Question for /u/grubiwan - how does the Metropolitan compare to the Prera, for you? I recently got a lime green Prera and installed my EF nib from my Penmanship... it's my current favorite pen. I love, love, love it. In part because of the feed/nib, but also the look and feel of the body --- it feels ""expensive"" somehow. I just wish it wasn't a short pen.  Does the Metropolitan have a similar ""expensive"" build quality? I keep reading that it's a metal barrel - but it looks plastic to me in all the photos.  The Metropolitan is probably my next purchase, but I'm curious to hear your comparison before I do."
fountainpens,3dnma9,JunkyardSam,3,Fri Jul 17 22:26:27 2015 UTC,"it's a metal barrel but it's a $15 pen at the end of the day. It feels high quality. the cap snaps tightly, the click is very nice."
fountainpens,3dnma9,Fade_0,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:03:59 2015 UTC,"So I half want to try it out of curiosity, but the other half wants to put the money toward a red and blue Prera so I can have a set. I guess I'll do both. What is it about fountain pens that makes us want to buy them all? I think there's a pathology to it, and one we all somehow have in common here."
fountainpens,3dnma9,JunkyardSam,2,Sat Jul 18 00:53:04 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's not for everyone. FOr me, the nib is weird in the sense that they're almost too long and drag a bit too much - but that's in comparison to my L2k. The Prera has the same exact nib, so that's how it'll write. Try getting it from a retailer with a return policy, maybe?"
fountainpens,3dnma9,Fade_0,2,Sat Jul 18 01:46:22 2015 UTC,"I have an EF Prera, 1 F nib metro, 1 medium nib metro and 12 EF pilot penmanships. Each of them filled with iroshizuku of different colors and a few other random ones (Ox blood, baystate blue, Jane Austen, other randoms I don't remember). I like my Prera for the demonstrator portion (Currently filled with Yama-Budo) but I feel like the Metro has a better feel in my hands for writing purposes. The penmanships I use for drawing a lot because they are so fine and make such a great line. I also use the penmanships and some Hero 616s with medium nibs for testing my ink samples (Hooray for Goulet!).   TLDR: I have a slight Pilot addiction. Metro > Prera for body feel/quality feel when writing. Prera I love for drawing."
fountainpens,3dnma9,Avaese,2,Sat Jul 18 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"I've never used the Prera, but I can address the feel of the Metro. It's definitely metal, but the paint/color they use doesn't leave it with a cold feel (well, as much as it might). It feels sturdy without feeling sterile. It's pretty nice, actually."

It seems that the quality can vary significantly between pens.  I have a x450 that's not so hot and some 599's that are mediocre.  I have a x750 though that I am very pleased with.  They are all very inexpensive...but if you're going to only pick up one, in my experience the x750 might be the best bet."

This one specifically:  http://www.gouletpens.com/jinhao-x450-fountain-pen-red-black/p/JIN-X450-RedBlack  If I buy it, I get a free X750.  I've seen some REALLY CHEAP Jinhao pens on Amazon and eBay.  Like a 4 pack of X450s for less than $10.00.  I wonder if Jinhao takes it rejects and sells them at a discount to these people that offer insanely low prices."
fountainpens,3dnma9,figboot11,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:58:17 2015 UTC,"There are two main issues I have with my x450.  The medium nib I have practically gushes ink.  The ink flow is waaaay to heavy.  The second issue is that it won't post correctly.  The cap won't securely stay on...or at least for my pen it won't.  I like the gripped section, though.  It's probably the heaviest pen I own...the thing weights a ton.  Not sure what material it is, but it feels like if I ran it over with my car, it might do more damage to my car than the pen.  For the prices you pay for these pens, you can't complain too much and you're never sure what you're going to get.  I ended up with a great x750 that I will use...and a number of other Jinhao's that I won't ever use that much.  All for the price of about $15.  Not bad."

Goulet charges more for these pens than Amazon or eBay.  I'm hoping they might QC them.  The chat rep did recommend I get a different converter.  And I've read about people getting a Goulet nib for their pen.  When you factor in the price of a Jinhao, a converter and a new nib, you're at the price of a better pen already.  Jinhao X450 - $9.99 Standard International Converter - $5.00 Goulet F two tone nib - $15.00  At that point you're at $29.99 at the price of a Lamy Safari or a TWSBI  ECO."

However, unless you're using the middle notebook (in my case, might be different with only 1 or 2 notebooks) it really doesn't lay flat. Despite that, it is a joy to use and I have no problem writing in any of the notebooks. If you don't mind getting one of the regular colors, you can find them for as low as $30 on Amazon.

The metal doodad is small enough and under the notebook spine so it really isn't an issue. The leather is supple and heavy, so the cover actually does lie pretty flat. However, the inserts definitely don't. It doesn't take a whole lot of effort to hold open, but your non-writing hand definitely has to help hold it open.

fountainpens,3do10y,bmac92,2,Sat Jul 18 06:36:17 2015 UTC,"Depending on cost, it might be better to go with the thin paper inserts midori sells. They are wonderful."
fountainpens,3do10y,bmac92,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:24:26 2015 UTC,I highly recommend getting the thin paper insert they make. It is far better than their other paper in my opinion.
fountainpens,3do10y,bmac92,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"I wanted to try those too, but I really love grid paper so I started with those. You don't have issues with bleed-thru on the thin paper? My jinhao is really wet."
fountainpens,3do10y,Kittycat-banana,2,Sat Jul 18 17:24:48 2015 UTC,"No problems at all. I typically use it with my lamy 1.1 stub and have no issues at all. There is some slight ghosting, but it is still perfectly usable on both sides. I'm glad I waited to get the blue one. I like it much more than black or brown."
fountainpens,3dmxn8,MyDarnSnakeLegs,5,Fri Jul 17 16:00:41 2015 UTC,"I'm still waiting for my local shop to get some in stock. I pre-ordered, otherwise I'd just order a bottle from Anderson Pens. If it takes too much longer I still might..."
fountainpens,3dmxn8,ElencherMind,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Anderson is sold out at this point, at least their website says so. Hoping to pick up a cartridge pack at the DC pen show though."

fountainpens,3dmxn8,scissor_get_it,3,Sat Jul 18 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"That's a very beautiful color!  Reminds me of Tsuki-yo, which is one of my favorite inks."
fountainpens,3dmxn8,Martinsimonnet,3,Fri Jul 17 17:00:37 2015 UTC,"It's Montblanc. It's an interesting shade of blue. Everything is pointing towards ""Martin is getting another bottle of ink""... But I really shouldn't. But it's gorgeous! But no I really shouldn't...  Thanks for the review, enjoy your new ink!"

fountainpens,3dmxn8,jessiew01,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:19:19 2015 UTC,Is this comparable to 54th?
fountainpens,3dmxn8,mitch_romley,2,Fri Jul 17 23:42:36 2015 UTC,Looks more like something like tsuki-yo.
fountainpens,3dodjd,Achatyla,2,Fri Jul 17 22:36:42 2015 UTC,"Waterman pens take standard international cartridges. If you want to broaden your ink perspectives, I'd suggest picking up a converter for it (not sure if the Perspective already comes with one), or just refill cartridges with bottled ink.   A few brands that have proprietary cartridge sizes are Pilot, Sheaffer and Lamy."
fountainpens,3dodjd,ProfUnderachiever,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:46:45 2015 UTC,"Standard International - got it. A converter shouldn't be hard to pick up, I imagine, if I felt I needed to. I'm assuming to refill cartridges with bottled ink would require some sort of syringe. I'll have to look into that.  I was also looking at a Pilot Metro for a cheaper alternative, if I ever get some disposable income."
fountainpens,3dodjd,ProfUnderachiever,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:05:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, you'll be needing a syringe to refill cartridges. Some vendors have blunt-ended syringes to keep you from stabbing yourself with a syringe full of ink, but regular ones from the drugstore should be fine.   The Metro is a great pen, and a hell of a great value at its price range. Definitely worth it."
fountainpens,3doo0m,joshfrank4165,2,Sat Jul 18 00:07:48 2015 UTC,"My favorite dark blue is Rohrer & Klingner Verdigris. If you're using cheap paper, X-Feather (black) is the best you can do. There are a couple, like Noodler's Zhivago or Private Reserve Ebony Purple, which could be a little more fun because they really look black but have some tint of color only when you really look at them."
fountainpens,3doo0m,reubenco,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:01:51 2015 UTC,"I love this too, but if they're strict about colors, it might tend too much toward teal."

fountainpens,3doo0m,if0rg0t2remember,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:22:56 2015 UTC,Tons of great dark blues out there even if you need waterproof. And they run the range from cheap to top shelf. So tell us what are looking for. Do you want more shading? sheen? waterproof?
fountainpens,3doo0m,if0rg0t2remember,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"Do you need any more specific abilities, such as permanence or waterproofing? The Warden series from Noodler's has those.   Also, will you be writing on your own paper, or school provided paper? If school paper, might have to take into account feathering and bleeding. Maybe X-Feather?"

fountainpens,3dkt8w,Bweeeeeeep,15,Fri Jul 17 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"Very very early thoughts, I absolutely love it! Will definitely be my daily carry at work, piston is excellent, smooth writer, I think the black might be slightly classier looking, cap is a bit too bulky compared to rest of the pen. Will post more thoughts after a day or two with it, overall first impression is extremely positive."
fountainpens,3dkt8w,PangurBanHammer,3,Fri Jul 17 03:44:33 2015 UTC,"What do you think about the Inspired Blue? I tried it a while ago and it was a beautiful turquoise, but changed to black after a day of use..."

fountainpens,3dkt8w,Bweeeeeeep,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:56:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe I just had a bit of ink left over or something weird like that. Wasn't sure if it was a known issue with the ink or anything."

fountainpens,3dkt8w,jordanjay29,3,Fri Jul 17 17:28:10 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Thanks OP! Also, are the nib and feed units removable(friction fit)?"
fountainpens,3dkt8w,gingermonkey1,8,Fri Jul 17 17:33:41 2015 UTC,100%  The nib and feed unit rotates and slides out very very easily. There does not appear to be a flat edge or notch in the feed unit; doesn't look like there is a specific orientation that it must be inserted.
fountainpens,3dkt8w,Bocote,3,Fri Jul 17 17:50:21 2015 UTC,That's stellar news!

fountainpens,3dkt8w,jordanjay29,3,Fri Jul 17 04:17:46 2015 UTC,"I paid $22.15 USD for Shipping which is only $6 less than the pen itself.

fountainpens,3dkt8w,Your_BestFriend,4,Fri Jul 17 02:51:08 2015 UTC,Oh! I think you're right. I always wondered why the Mini is referenced as a #5 but is smaller than the 580's #5. The Vac is definitely a #6. What a family they have.

fountainpens,3dkt8w,Your_BestFriend,5,Fri Jul 17 03:42:04 2015 UTC,"Sure. Compare the 580 to the Eco and the Mini.   The Eco and Mini nibs are identical in shape, and TWSBI already mentioned they are the same nibs. I think that's pretty solid.  EDIT: Crap, second link was wrong. I replaced it."

I shouldn't pay $50 for a pen that only works for 2 years even though it sits in a case whenever it isn't used and is treated well. It's silly.

The Prera is nice (good balance, good material feel, cap snap is beautiful, looks classy especially in its opaque form) but it's a c/c filler and has some issues with ink getting trapped in the inner cap (although with some fiddling it can be taken out and cleaned).  I also have no idea how big the Eco is, but the Prera is pretty small, comparable in length to my short Sheaffer cartridge pens (the ones with the flat butt), much shorter than the Metro, for instance. Although some people like that so it could also be a plus."
fountainpens,3dmt4s,plazman30,9,Fri Jul 17 15:25:44 2015 UTC,Try a sample and see what you think. I got one recently. It cleaned up out of my sink ok but stained my middle finger for a day or two lol. It's not at all as vibrant as baystate. Online it looks pretty close and it is a nice blue. Though I preferred the regular blue than Liberty's Elysium. But from all three baystate just catches my eye more than any of them.

I may one day buy an eyedropper pen and some Baystate Blue.  Or just get a cheap Jinhao and dedicate it to Baystate Blue."

I would suggest a jinhao or if your using a preppy to refill the included cartridge with an ink syringe. The idea of that much staining potential worried me so I filled the cartridge it came with vs eye dropper filling the preppy.

Haven't had any problems with it gunking up my pens or staining surfaces, but it is harder to get off hands should you get it on them.   I really like the color. Being used in a world surrounded by regular ball point pens the brighter blue really stands out vs a typical dark blue pen."
fountainpens,3dmt4s,tonykony,3,Fri Jul 17 16:55:53 2015 UTC,"I have used it quite a bit, I really like it. The only problem I have had with it is that it seems to get a little chalky and gunky on the nib after about 10 or so days of sitting in the pen. I fixed this by running the nib under warm water. Comes right off and no more hard starts or skipping. It will also leave your fingers blue for a day or two if you happen to spill any. It was never a big hassle."
fountainpens,3dmt4s,techwizrd,2,Fri Jul 17 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"yeah, i've found that some of the noodler's inks require a bit of dilution to improve flow or dry-out time.  The good part is that most of those inks are so saturated that a little bit of water won't change the color too much."

When you get it on your fingers it rubs onto different things like a bitch, but if you can get over it, it's a beautiful color. It's my favorite and i use it in school and for notes etc."

Funnily enough the fix for mine was when it fell out of its cap on my lanyard and I backed over it in a work van. By the time I found what I'd done to the poor nib (the barrel has some nice battlescars too) I roughly bent it back just so I could write down a phone number and its actually performed much better since, quickly becoming my favourite pen.  So yeah, sounds like it could be just a shitty luck of the draw on QC, either try and get your hands on another Safari (store or friend perhaps) to compare and try some precision nib readjustments using a Hyundai iLoad until you get the desired amount of inkflow."

EF's are the most likely to show scratchiness as they are the 'sharpest', and one or two of mine have been quite annoyingly scratchy, forcing me to smooth them out before even using it to write a 2nd sentence. I've seen skipping, misaligned tines, and general scratchiness out of the box, but it's always been fixable.  I have some micromesh paper that I smooth all my nibs with. It's a joy to use, and re-finishing your nibs is a rewarding skill to have!  NONE have had issue with misalignment though. All 7 are perfect in that regard.. I've bought from Goulet, jetpens and random malaysian ebay sellers and all have been good.  Those 2 issues you have together would probably make me want to return it, though.

This makes me think with a little bendy or flossing magic I could probably adjust the F nib into working better since it doesn't seem to be a problem with the feed.

I was using Parker Vector and Parker Frontier (a newer one). I also almost always used Parker Quink ink (black mainly).   This past month, I experimented a lot:    I got the TWISBI 580 Aluminum with Medium Nib (I used to use fine nibs but after switching, I can't stand them anymore) I switched from Parker's Quink to Noodlers Black which is around two shades darker and I like it.  I got the Safari Lamy after I heard SO SO SO many recommendations and reviews about it. I got the one which as the Charcoal finish with a medium nib and a converter. I am liking it but not as much as my TWISBI (which is ofcourse more expensive). But it does live up to the hype in general.  I got Waterman's Harmonious Green ink after the store manager recommended it. I was going for Pelikan Turqoise as I thought that it was a nice shade, and it was something that was useable with everyday stationery. I went for the green cause it was cheaper but I don't mind it at all. It isn't something that I can use every day but it is an addition to my previously Parker ONLY collection.  I saw the Faber Castell Basic pen (around 30 bucks I think) or maybe it was a Pilot... ? ) and I am edging to get that one next.  I will definitely check out the Pelikan Turquoise ink which I didn't buy next time but I wouldn't mind any recommendations from people... I am looking for something that is both rare (in shade) but cheap enough for repurchase and when I mean cheap, I think think that Pelikan Edelstein is very expensive.    I know, a lot happened."

fountainpens,3dmiuu,Oncotic,2,Fri Jul 17 18:46:22 2015 UTC,"I am confused. You said it seeps out on a napkin but it stops on a page? That doesn't sound right. Have you tried stress testing the feed and seeing if it dries out on a napkin, dotting it repeatedly?  Also dip the nib in ink. Just having a cart or an eyedropper inside might not enough to totally wet the feed.   There's either two things wrong with your pen: the nib needs to be widened or the feed can't keep up. With your description, it sounds contradictory, but you might just need to widen the tines."
fountainpens,3dmiuu,Alkuelio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:34:28 2015 UTC,"It writes a bit if I push it down really hard first. It writes as long as I keep the nib in the paper, but stops if I raise it. Also, it writes well on my eraser and other more tacky surfaces, but not paper.  Should I just push it down even harder and hope it widens the nib?  Also the feeder(?) doesn't fill up completely.

fountainpens,3dmiuu,Oncotic,2,Fri Jul 17 20:41:55 2015 UTC,"It isnt a problem with the feed. Sounds like the tines are tight. Yeah, you could push it down and spring them, but that also pushes them up. If you have brass shims or some thin material like X-ray film, you can try and use that to separate and floss the tines, and that separates them the right way.   Do what you think is necessary. Just don't do it too much. Sprung tines are harder to fix once you have overdone it. I recommend looking at them first under a loupe and seeing how separated they are. Typically for good nibs, there will be some separation, but not much. If you can see through the gap it is probably sprung too much already. If they are super tight and you can't see anything, even ink between them then it might be time to widen them.  Also I stress the importance of dipping the pen in ink. That is the proper way to get a pen flowing right."

I've received a nib or two for these old ones in pretty bad shape, but with a little push pull, mesh, and the guidance of a loupe, I find them to be fine writers.  Some even crappier Sheaffer school/casual hooded pens (which consequently, the cartridges do get stuck in) that I gave to friends as little gifts have had some of THE smoothest steel nibs I've ever experienced.  They were also delightfully postable.

It's hard to explain because I don't really know what's causing it to feel like that. My Pilot Metro and Levenger True Writer both have inflexible steel nibs and they just feel so much more alive to me.  They really do live up to their ""No Nonsense"" name, though.

If you wanted to just play it safe, I'd recommend emptying the ink out and cleaning your pen."
fountainpens,3dmaw0,hombreverde,3,Fri Jul 17 16:30:45 2015 UTC,"It's good practice to empty the ink, and wash and dry the pen before you leave it for longer than a week or so. That said, I haven't always been the most stringent when it comes to pen hygiene. I've left a Lamy Safari inked for a month, and it worked without skipping a beat when I returned. Besides the pen, it depends a lot on the ink too."
fountainpens,3dmaw0,Rayleigh-Blue,2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:40 2015 UTC,I left my ink for a month and a half with no problems. I was going to clean them out before a trip to Guatemala but I ran out of time. They all worked perfectly well upon my return.
fountainpens,3dmaw0,ch4rr3d,2,Fri Jul 17 14:18:44 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, for me it would depend on the pen, ink, and where you're going to store it. Could you share any of this info?"

fountainpens,3dmaw0,codenamesrcl,2,Fri Jul 17 12:59:50 2015 UTC,"It depends a lot on the pen and the ink and so forth. I've had some that were ready to go after 2-3 weeks of neglect, and I've definitely had some that were hard starts after being left, capped, overnight.  Also, I'm forgetful. My biggest concern with leaving a pen inked and out of sight for very long isn't just that the pen (or just the feed) might dry out in the interim. It's that I'll forget about it entirely and it will be months or years before I pick it up again. I hope that's just me, though."
fountainpens,3dlimh,ChipSalsa,6,Fri Jul 17 06:20:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't know Platinum made one, but that type of pocket pen was very popular in Japan in the 70s, and Pilot and Sailor definitely made them (Pilot had the famous Elite and Myu). The idea is that if you post it it becomes a full sized pen.  I believe most of them were black, though (which is almost a running joke of the time, that all of them looked exactly the same), so this also puzzles me. Maybe it was meant as a competitor to the Myu?"
fountainpens,3dlimh,Hedgehogs4Me,3,Fri Jul 17 06:38:37 2015 UTC,"When posted, it slides off easily. I saw this blog when I was on google. The body looks the same but the nib is a different color."
fountainpens,3dlimh,tomattarashinu,8,Fri Jul 17 06:49:01 2015 UTC,"The pen on that blog is the same pen but an earlier version because it has a ""Pt. Alloy"" nib.    You can check out the Platinum History page.  Bullet number 29.  It's hard to understand because the bullet is above 1968 (it says ""Stainless Type - Pocket 18"" in Japanese) but the photo of the pen is below 1968.  Yours should be a 1970's model.  The first versions of that pen had the old Platinum ""S*N"" Globe mark on it.    Here is a gallery of a few I have in my collection.  The first two had the S*N mark, the other three have a ""P"" mark on the nib.  The reason yours does not cap / post well is because the center ring in on backwards.  If you look at the last picture in my gallery, you can see the parts.  Just unscrew it, flip the ring over and screw it back on.  It's a pretty common mistake and easy to fix.  There are a few Japanese blogs posts about that pen.  It seems to have come in black, blue or green.  It also came with or without an inlay.  Links (all Japanese):   http://blog.livedoor.jp/pen_parade1000/archives/1787237.html http://mokkindou.exblog.jp/17133709 http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/idesituki/17194480.html   For some other Platinum history, they have an English page, which for some strange reason is totally different from their Japanese page.  Edit:  Your last picture says 18KGP which is a mistake - that means 18K Gold Plated.  Your nib is 18K.  Also is says 「細字」 which means it is a fine nib."

fountainpens,3dlimh,Hedgehogs4Me,3,Fri Jul 17 16:01:51 2015 UTC,"Your cap might be missing the inner cap clutch.    It looks like this.  You would need to shine a light inside the cap and see if there is a part like that inside.    It will look like this inside the cap.  If you see it, it is pushed into the cap too far and not gripping on the body.    If you don't see it, you will need to hunt for the part.  It will be specific to that pen because the length and diameter need to be correct.  BTW.  Do not but that ebay auction for this pen.  That is just a good picture of the part."

I don't know enough to say whether there's any chance they made different nibs or whether it varied by region, but it's entirely possible. I know that Sheaffer, for instance, offered a pretty fun alternative to its gold and steel nibs in the form of a palladium-silver alloy at around the same time (maybe a little earlier), so having nib material options could've potentially been trendy."

I don't know how to determine the presence of iron gall in an ink, but to be safe I would assume it's there and treat the pen accordingly.   I've googled the subject a little but I'm no expert. You should look into it. Iron gall inks were typically blue-black and were used where permanence was required."

And, yeah, as far as I know there isn't a way to save moldy ink. Not sure if there's a proper method for disposing of that much ink. I'd get a second opinion first anyway!"
fountainpens,3djl0i,ThegreatandpowerfulR,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:23:43 2015 UTC,I think a lot of Noodler's inks smell bad enough to turn people off :P
fountainpens,3djl0i,Nekromos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:09:05 2015 UTC,"Haha, to each his own. Mold generally smells worse, though, unless you've got some prime cheese curds in there."
fountainpens,3djl0i,reubenco,3,Thu Jul 16 23:12:46 2015 UTC,"It is probably not moldy unless it has scum floating in it, and old ink will smell considerably more harsh and chemical than modern ink, so I would not worry about the smell unless it smells rotten. I would also be carefull not to leave your pen idle/let it dry out and wash the pen thoroughly after you use it though."
fountainpens,3djl0i,Noxonomus,3,Fri Jul 17 01:44:49 2015 UTC,That bottle seems like it's more likely to contain dip pen ink than fountain pen ink.  I'd be hesitant to use it in a fountain pen without being able to confirm the contents.
fountainpens,3djl0i,middlesmith,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:16:47 2015 UTC,That would make sense ... Hadn't thought of that. Neighbour said it was from a school closing down. The good old days of ink wells I guess. No probs ... I have dip-nibs too! I'll clean out the pen.
fountainpens,3djl0i,ImprezaDrezza,3,Thu Jul 16 21:20:41 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, I think that cleaning the pen is a good idea regardless, that's the first thing I would have done. I think the ink might be appropriate though. I mean, it might not be, but nothing about the label made me specifically think that's dip pen ink. Especially if it came from the same place as the pen, there's reason to think they go together."
fountainpens,3djl0i,OwlsKilledMyDad,2,Thu Jul 16 22:54:22 2015 UTC,I may be mistaken as I'm doing this from memory but I think that pen was made for Papermate by Montblanc.

Like 15 ink cartridges of decent enough ink. Wasn't really worth it for the rest. The fountain pen barely even worked. The pencil is kind of cool though.

Now I have had some  weird gifts and brought some shitty things in my time.  This. This was the worst.  Even though it cost me only £7.50, I was sad that I spent that money on this utter horse bollocks of a set. The pens all tarnished within like a week, the roller ball and ball point twist sections hadn't been lubed at all it seemed, so they make a grinding noise whenever use. The fountain pen was the worst though. Bobby's set didn't work, mine worked, but it seemed that there was no restraint in the feed, because the nib just pushed ink through no matter what. It was really fekkin odd."

If you want a Jinhao, then DHGate is probably a good place.  If you want some generic electronic gizmo, probably a good place.  If you want a western 'luxury' brand, then it is a good place to get a fake.  Fine place to buy from as long as you think about the plausibility of what you are getting.  I would honestly be surprised if you could find a single legitimate Parker or Lamy pen on the entire site.

I'll edit the OP to reflect this, but to answer your question something along the range of $80-120.   I've been looking at the (Pilot?) Namiki Falcon for a while, but it seems the manufacturer changed some fabrication method and people have been upset at the reduction in quality. Hopefully reports of the quality's demise are exaggerated.  I hadn't realistically considered vintage pens; I should probably take a look at the sidebar for info, but I have to admit I know so little about vintage pens that it's a little intimidating."

Not to mention wonderful to use, and have a bit of history to them. The falcon is definitely a pretty pen, but it is not the most recommended. A Custom 74 can easily be find in your budget, and those a pretty standard pens that work well. Parker Vacumatics can also be found in that category restored. You may be able to find a cheaper Pelikan but they are pretty small, not really my taste (the vacumatic is too small for me as well, but I love the look of it :) )  I believe you can find a LAMY 2000 in that price range which is a highly regarded pen as well!"

fountainpens,3dl1lo,JunkyardSam,2,Fri Jul 17 07:46:33 2015 UTC,"Congratulations, I want a Falcon so badly. Did you get the resin or metal barrel? How are the threads? I have a Pilot Penmanship that always wants to spin the cap on at a point that would strip the threads if I gave it any force. It's hard to describe, but there are basically two points I can start spinning the cap on - one is ""right"" and the other would ruin the threads... but it will 'want' to spin on either. Does that happen at all?  I'm saving up for the metal Falcon. At $240 I want the pen to be flawlessly perfect and I'm very nervous about it!"

fountainpens,3dl1lo,jd530,3,Fri Jul 17 23:27:52 2015 UTC,"I started with a Metro, and then moved to a Vista and a Safari, which were significantly nicer writing experiences. I had also been lusting after a TWSBI and a Pelikan M100 Stormtrooper, and have not regretted the upgrade; they both write significantly better than the Lamys, with the M100 taking the cake by far for best pen in my collection. I've enjoyed the experience so much that I would greatly suggest a Pelikan as what you try next. The nibs will be similar in size to the Lamys as they're both European, but I've found that my Pelikan writes a bit wetter."
fountainpens,3dl1lo,techwizrd,3,Fri Jul 17 12:54:29 2015 UTC,"Get a Pilot CH 92 or a Custom 74. I just got a Pilot CH 92 a few weeks ago and I love it. I also got a Pelikan M205 a month ago and I like it as well (it looks pretty and classic, but feels too light/cheap). If you are into the VPs, you should definitely get a VP. They look and write superbly, although I still prefer piston-fillers like my CH 92.  My girlfriend bought me a TWSBI Diamond 580 Rose Gold and it is hands down my favorite pen so far (although someone stole it). The TWSBI Eco just came out as well."
fountainpens,3dl1lo,Sun_Queen,2,Fri Jul 17 04:31:01 2015 UTC,"I started with lamy and really enjoyed them, so I'll give you my experience moving up in the world of fountain pens.  My first ""nice"" was a pelikan M200 (with medium nib) and I loved it! this is still one of my favorite pens. I think the piston filling system is super nice and being able to go  longer without refilling is awesome!  I got a couple twsbi pens later and I haven't been blown away by them in the long term. I have the mini and the 580. With the mini I enjoy it but posting it is kind of a pain and with the 580 it just feels kind of heavy/big so it tires me out in long writing sessions (though my hands are very small).  Then I got into pilot pens. I have a vanishing point which is my favorite pen probably, the convenience is amazing and the nib is like butter (I just ordered another actually). I also have a pilot stargazer which has an amazing nib and the metal body gives it a nice weight even though it's rather small. I like the pilots because the gold nibs feel very soft when writing.  I think over all I'd get a pilot or pelikan as your first step 'up' because they are extremely awesome and reliable.   I hope some of my ramblings help you!"
fountainpens,3dl1lo,Sun_Queen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:33:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I have to say, the Stargazer is an absolute looker! How large would you say the Pilot stargazer is compared to the Lamy studio and CP1 in terms of both nib size (lamy EF vs Pilot F) and physical dimensions? I also have small hands so it's important to find something that will be comfortable for daily use."
fountainpens,3dl1lo,Sun_Queen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:43:13 2015 UTC,the stargazer is ver pretty :)  it's much smaller than those pens when posted. also in my experience pilot nibs write much finer than lamy nibs but I don't have them in front of me for comparison

fountainpens,3dl1lo,Barren23,2,Fri Jul 17 08:22:22 2015 UTC,"Skip all of them and find yourself a Sheaffer Imperial or Imperial Triumph.  Same pen, really, the only difference is the Imperial is a vintage pen with a touchdown filler (no c/c) while the Imperial Triumph is the c/c version.  The Imperial lines feature the famous and oh-so-heavenly inlaid nib and depending on which way you go, have a gold or SS nib.  Either version should definitely fit into your budget too, although the c/c version will be easier to find in that range."

I like them all for different reasons, you could also try Faber-Castell.  I know I'm in the minority here but my Lamy is one of my least favorite pens, it writes fine but I don't get as smooth of a feel as my other nibs."

I just bought a Pelikan M200 Cafe Creme for about $120 and love it. I'd also recommend checking out Pilot's, they have a lot of great pens in that range especially if you buy from Japan, you can probably get a CH92 if you want to get away from c/c pens."

I got a sample about a week ago, and I've only had it in two pens so far, but as far as I've tried it it's the perfect True Red for me. :) My other close competitor up until this point has been Sheaffer Skrip Red, which is another jewel tone nearly-perfect ""just Red"" red. Between the two, I would say that the Appleton Red is just a bit darker and just a bit more saturated, where the Skrip Red is just a little thinner. Both are lovely jewel tones with basically zero feathering, even on notebook paper.   I will say that in the pens I've tried it in so far, the Appleton Red tends to flow juuust a little dry. I think this is because thinner ink doesn't have as strong of capilary action, but that's just an uneducated guess.   At any rate, I'd love to pick up a full bottle of the Appleton Red at some point, but given that I already own a bottle of Skrip Red and the two are really close to one another relatively speaking, I'll probably be content with what I have. :)"

I'm not even sure my friend is going to use it, he was complaining about his ballpoint running out of ink in his last letter, so this was somewhat of a gag gift."

fountainpens,3di2ye,Leonidas_from_XIV,3,Thu Jul 16 21:08:00 2015 UTC,"Today I received the Platinum Preppy 0.2. What first attracted me to this pen was how remarkably fine the nib was. Due to its incredibly low price I decided to satisfy my curiosity and take the plunge.   As you can see from the picture, the nib is indeed very fine. It is pretty remarkable as it is so fine as to work on printer paper without feathering, which even the fine nibbed Kakuno cannot manage.   It isn't the smoothest pen in the world, so that might be off putting for some people, but that depends on your writing style. If you don't write in cursive it really isn't an issue.   Considering how low the price is I would say that I am impressed and would recommend people checking it out, as if you like using fountain pens and need something for when out and about this is perfect as you don't have to worry about it."

(the others work to varying degrees of scratchiness/dryness.)  The Lamy Safari EF is SO good upside down that I can just switch and write/draw continuously to change up the line width. It feels like it was made to do this!!! Except for the grip. That grip is annoying when the pen is upside down =(  Oddly, though, my Lamy F nib doesn't work as well upside down. Hmm."

fountainpens,3di2ye,tunnotron3000,2,Thu Jul 16 15:37:43 2015 UTC,I'm sure you can adjust them like any old pen. I've had it on the micro mesh nail file a bunch of times and it hasn't made a lick of difference apart from making the line thicker. Tines are in perfect alignment too.

My Pilot EF nib felt less scratchy once I corrected the feed to be more of a wet writer. (Not TOO wet, just the right amount.)  For that pen it was a matter of adjusting the feed with an exacto knife. I just made sure all the fins were even, really. Some of them didn't seem to be fully cut through from the factor. That turned my Penmanship EF from this dry scratchy thing to feeling ""just right."" I moved that nib & feed into my Prera and now I have a pen I love."

Permanency is nice if you've ever dropped a notebook in water like me, and lost your notes.  I also think iron gall inks, while semi permanent and fun, are not good for everyday rotation because of the corrosion issue. In my experience, my iron gall MB was difficult to clean, though gorgeous.  For these reasons, I think Noodler's Black is the most practical despite being kind of boring. Well behaved, cheap, and fits all the criteria. It is not a super fast dryer, though."

fountainpens,3dhwv0,Ineverlosethegame,5,Thu Jul 16 12:20:41 2015 UTC,"Have the M600 in white tortie, and three M800s. I  like the weight and the size of the M800 more than the M600. The nibs are pretty similar to me, firm and stubbish (I have them in Bs and BBs), and neither of them can compare to the writing feel of my M1005's nib. However for everyday usage, I favour the M800. M800 is slightly heavier due to its brass piston compared to M600's plastic piston. To be honest I only got the M600 for the pattern."
fountainpens,3dhwv0,cellardoor04,3,Thu Jul 16 13:08:29 2015 UTC,"The question in these modern pens really boils down to size. If you like a light pen, go M600. If you prefer heftier, go M800. That really is the biggest distinction between the lines. The other stuff like 18C vs 14C nibs are less consequential."
fountainpens,3dhwv0,pelikansperch,2,Thu Jul 16 18:48:59 2015 UTC,"I have tried both pens - an 805 and a 600 w/ green stripe barrel.  Neither worked for me because my fingers are (sorry) meaty and sweaty and I need a thicker and also differently shaped section.  Still, I have thoughts for you on comparing the two pens as well as what may work for you if your hands are like mine.  The 800 is a lovely pen for you if you don't have my problem, and meet, to my mind, two other conditions.  1. you like to write without the cap posted, 2. the pen fits well in your hand (barrel length wise) when unposted.  I think these are the conditions nescessary because the brass piston found in the 800 makes it notably heavier toward the back of the barrel.  This should NOT be a problem if you meet the above conditions.  However, if the pen is not big enough for your hands and nearly falls through, or if it's too small and the heavy part sticks way out back, or if you must write posted, well then I think you will find the balance of the 800 wonky.  I have all of these problems! I really prefer to write posted, and the 800 was not quite big enough for me barrel-length wise when unposted.  Furthermore, as I already mentioned, the section was nowhere near big enough to accommodate me.  This was quite frustrating since the 800 is actually a BRILLIANT pen aesthetically and mechanically.  So then we have the 600.  With a plastic piston, this pen should eliminate some of the balance issues, and it does.  Posted, it has the PERFECT size and weight for my particular hand (8"" thumb to index spread, 9"" thumb to pinky spread and about 3/4"" thick fingers - infer whatever else you'd like).  However, I was a fool to get it because if I was already iffy about the 800's section, this was a total disaster in terms of finger placement.  I grip three fingers (which I know some of you will say is wrong, but whatever, I do) and I honestly couldn't fit all three on the section.  I had to cross the third underneath and just push up like in the more traditional grip, which I really can't do.  It was a mess.  Furthermore, the particular 600 I bought at deep discount from spain on amazon, didn't even post.  It was too skinny in the barrel - a downside of semi-artisanal manufacturing. So I wrapped a small custom cut strip of scotch tape around the barrel in the appropriate location and got it to post as directed on fpn.  Varying the width of the strip varied the posting friction and firmness.  The tape wore down over time so if you're doing this, shoot for posting to be a bit firmer at first than you'd ultimately want. Alternately, return the pen, as I did for all of the above reasons.  Ultimately, I give the edge to the 600 for price, balance, and theoretical posting comfort - but only if you have smaller fingers than mine, and/or prefer smaller sections.  Some folks say the 800's nib is flexier than the 600's.  It has to be in theory because it's bigger right? But if it actually was, I didn't notice.  Both will give you subtle variation if pushed, but then, why are you pushing your $100/200 nib?  My eventual solution - Sailor 1911 Full Size 21K Realo (Mine's all Rhodium) which usually retails within the same ballpark of a 600.  It has a way heftier section with much more of a straight taper and posts like a pro.  It has a piston alright, but it's sadly nothing as lovely as a Pelikan piston.  Transplant surgery is sadly out, but I'm still a very happy camper."
fountainpens,3dhwv0,irgendwalrus,2,Thu Jul 16 20:59:58 2015 UTC,"The m800 has the brass filling system which is a huge bonus for some. Personally I have an m1000 (which also had a brass filler) and an M640 (which has a plastic one) and they're both fantastic. The other consideration would be the nib which I only have experience with the M640 nib which is fantastic now. I doubt you'll be disappointed either way.   One thing to note and I may be an outlier here, but I had to send both my M640 and m1000 back to chartpak because they were hard starters. If you can ask the seller to check the nib for you before they ship I would highly recommend it. My m640 nib is much better now and my m1000 is getting back today but if I could do it again. If get it somewhere where it could be checked out and tuned first.  Edit brass filler not bread filler although pelikan should get on that"

Fill from cup, expel into sink, until the expelled water is clear.  About a half dozen times will probably do it (I'm more fanatical if the pen is going into storage).  Between each expel and fill, hold the nib to a paper towel for a count of 5 to 10 seconds to wick the inky water from the nib and feed. I find this last point cuts down on the number of fill/expel cycles needed."

fountainpens,3dhe69,nallabor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:35:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've had a heavier case for a pen yet. The Omas FAO LE's case is basically a white marble tube with a brass insert, which you put the pen in when you put it into it's sleeve then cork it off. Or as Ray said, it came with it's own crypt. The FAO is my second Omas after the Omas Europa LE here : http://pens.kbeezie.com/post/omas_europa_limited/  The Aurora Afrika LE, didn't come with it's original box but a standard Optima box (which the pen doesn't fit into the little groove/slot because it's bigger than an Optima).  So yea. Two new ones.  The Aurora is marked ""M"" on the feed, but it seems like an EF or a small Fine, even with the decent wetness for shading (the physical tipping seems more like a EF~F as well) and does not appear to have been ground under the loupe. Which is fine with me I like western EF~F, but it's the main reason why the seller traded for my M805 with the 18K Architect nib. He likes them wet and thicker, I took care of the dry part in 5 seconds with brass shim.   I like the light weight of it as well as how it feels in the hand, and even though the nib has feedback it's more like a pencil feedback, even with a very light hand it doesn't skip a beat, the way I love it.   Have not inked the Omas yet, going to probably wait til this weekend when I got more free time to de-ink some and plan my rotation. Piston was a tad stiff so I went ahead and greased it a little bit, smoother now. I might ink it with Montblanc Irish Green, but seeing as the Aurora is more like an EF~F and the Omas is a F I'll be thinking more about how I want to ink this weekend.  Also plan on getting detailed shots of each individually later this week."

The price, from what little I know (I don't own any Montblancs, but I'm sure those who do will be in this thread soon), is reasonable for some of the Meisterstucks. Some of the lower-end models might be just worth about that much new, so you should be certain to examine the pen for wear, tear, scratches, dings, and performance issues.   Also ask the seller to make out a receipt for the purchase if you do wind up buying. Name, date, item sold, amount and method (cash), s/he signs it, you sign it.

fountainpens,3dk5it,trylliana,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:43:07 2015 UTC,Separating tines that are too tight for more flow.
fountainpens,3dk5it,tato_salad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:09:39 2015 UTC,I use a razor blade for that. would never DIY on an expensive one though and if I were I'd definitely want the right thing before doing it. Heard it can cause it to develop a lot of creep along the split
fountainpens,3dk5it,trylliana,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:13:34 2015 UTC,Think of it as flossing.
fountainpens,3dk5it,Whales_of_Pain,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:50:46 2015 UTC,But how thick is it?  There's more than one way to damage a nib.

fountainpens,3dk5it,Canthros,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"Aluminum rather quickly form aluminum oxide, which is rather abrasive."
fountainpens,3dk5it,Iliketofeeluplifted,4,Fri Jul 17 01:27:20 2015 UTC,"""rather quickly""  isn't is basically instantly? I remember reading that the only reason Aluminium doesn't rust is because the outside layer turns to aluminium oxide so fast that it protects what's underneath. Not sure the science behidn it though."
fountainpens,3dk5it,Canthros,3,Fri Jul 17 08:27:30 2015 UTC,"It's very fast, but I don't think it's actually instant. If I'm not mistaken, you could polish an area of an aluminum can to a nice shine and watch it slowly dull as the alumina formed over the exposed metal, but it will stay shiny for a little while.  ETA: I am also not a chemist or metallurgist. But I've picked up a bunch of useless trivia, here and there."
fountainpens,3dk5it,dxing97,3,Fri Jul 17 11:07:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, aluminium (III) oxide. Same material as sapphires and corundum, which is why i recommend using these slips immediately after their creation, and discarding them afterward"
fountainpens,3dk5it,thankyouforthesofa,2,Fri Jul 17 01:38:37 2015 UTC,"The layer of aluminum oxide that forms on fresh aluminum is very thin, likely measured in atoms. If there's any abrasive action, it's probably due to the bulk metal itself. I believe gold nibs would be more susceptible to this, but that applies to brass sheets as well.   I've tried flossing tines with aluminum foil, and most of the time it was almost too soft to even get between the tines. It was too soft to wedge between the tipping, where the tines are closest. Given the strength of aluminum cans, I doubt the walls are thin enough to fit between the tines, although I've never tried. They could be made of a harder alloy, but I think cans are just mostly pure aluminum.   Aluminum is a soft metal, so I think the most damage you could cause from cans is accidentally spreading the love tines and leaving scraped paint between the tines."
fountainpens,3dhtao,cdewji,6,Thu Jul 16 11:39:14 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they just released the Eco, but their customer service can be spotty, and become downright rude when your pen keeps breaking from what I've heard, though I know that's not your situation.  Send a follow up email, and if they still don't respond I'm not sure, toss another post up on here and see what people say for escalation after an ignored follow up"
fountainpens,3dhtao,jd530,2,Thu Jul 16 12:08:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Try emailing Philip again; the launch of a new product probably has his inbox flooded.   Their CS isn't at the ""Amazon/Goulet Level"" that we've come to expect from e-retailers, at least in terms of consistency. Every time I've had a problem with one of their products, they back it 100%--but sometimes it isn't as smooth a process as it could be."

I've come to find from talking to people online and from my own experience. That one or two problems and TWSBI provides good customer service.

fountainpens,3dhtao,Iliketofeeluplifted,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:34:37 2015 UTC,"Amazon? I didn't think there was any comparison between Amazon and Goulet - the former barely packages pens correctly, when Goulet is basically famous for their personalization."
fountainpens,3dhtao,klundtasaur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:29:54 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're talking specifically about just the packaging, then you're kinda right, depending on the seller.   However, I was referring to overall customer service, where there is always a CS representative available, emails are answered almost immediately, and problems are always solved in the customer's favor. In those respects, Amazon and Goulet are nearly identical."
fountainpens,3dhtao,jordanjay29,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:32:53 2015 UTC,"I've found that Amazon almost always treats customers very well except for two main exceptions:   Packaging is kind of hit or miss depending on the warehouse, how many items you order, how many times it's repacked, and what phase of the moon we're in. You could get a 4x6"" box for a little converter, or a mailing envelope for a Lamy Safari. More and more, Amazon is using Prime as an exclusive for its customers with $99 to kill each year. Yes, there are certainly many incentives to buy into Prime, but with sales like Prime Day and some products that actually require Prime membership to purchase (your non-Prime money is no good here!), I have a feeling that this will be a trend that Amazon continues for its self-stocked products. Which means that soon, Fountain Pens could be hidden behind this paywall.    Yet, once in the door, and the product in your hand, Amazon delivers excellent service in case of a mishap, defect or problem, even if the item is sold by a partner in their marketplace."

You don't get tracking on the free shipping, but you do get insurance, and interestingly you also have signature required on delivery. It is definitely the slow post option. I think it took about two weeks to get here. I got an email from them telling me that it was shipping, and to contact them if it didn't get here within 14 days. It still got here before people got their massdrop orders though, heh.  The packaging I recall being adequate. Three bottles were inside a little box built to hold them in individual compartments, and the other two were firmly bubble wrapped. It was all packed snugly in a small box that they did not have room to roll around in."

I thought ""Great! I will get this pen super clean!"" and continues cleaning the feed and inside of the pen.   And then the dumb part. Without thinking (because I am tired/stressed) I just went and pushed the feed back in. And jammed it, because obviously there is some directionality involved. As you can see from the first picture, I really messed up. The second picture shows the feed carnage.   I looked through a few forum posts and I see that what I did was why people recommend NOT removing the feed...   Mostly this is just a bit of a venting session for me, but I was also wondering if there was any way to get a replacement feed. From my brief searching they seem hard to come by, and I guess that makes sense based on the price of the pen.  On a happy note, I did just get a bunch of new ink samples :)"

Forced it in even farther I am afraid (it was down to the little nub thing in the first picture).  I also tried forcing it out and beat up the feed a bit, but with no luck of getting it out.  Then I let it sit in water for a night and in the morning yanked it out with bent nose pliers and it actually still works.  The end is all chewed up, but I was able to push the nib on.  It leaks a tiny bit out of one of the sides, but for the most part it works, so if it happens again (Unlikely I know!), just let it set for a bit and grab it by the top and bottom with bent nose pliers (this will prevent the leaking I have, cause I tried first on the sides and messed up those little rails for the nib) and yank.  Squeeze hard enough that it doesn't slip or you will do more damage to the feed."

Modern Waterman pens are definitely very different, but I think the divide is between Waterman vintage and now (the vintage WMs are incredible).  Either way, great pen! You should get yourself some more ink–there's an array of beautiful colors out there. Check out some Youtube channels, I personally love the Goulet Pen Company and sbrebrown's reviews.

fountainpens,3dfay2,recordis17,2,Wed Jul 15 22:50:23 2015 UTC,"There are really two big divides in Watermans, between their pre-depression, depression+, and modern eras. Waterman was originally a big American company and it had some great pens - this is where you get your numbered models, colour nibs, whatever else. Fantastic pens in general. Then you get your divide as they move to France (moving their base of operations to the Jif-Waterman branch? Something like that?), and the pens are still alright, but they're not huge and dominant anymore. This is where you see pens like the Stalwart with that really recognizable clip, but not too much else that really makes them stand out. Their big hit was the Hundred Year, of course, which was... well, that stood out, haha.  As you get toward the present, well, I'm not quite sure where the divide is there, but at some point they change again to be basically what they are now, and as far as I know they're decent pens still but some people think they're overpriced, occasionally they get bad reviews, that sort of thing. I'm reserving judgement until I get to try one, though."

fountainpens,3dfrjt,SharnaRanwan,3,Thu Jul 16 10:12:28 2015 UTC,"You could try adding a little lubricant to the ink. If you have a sample vial, add a drop (just one) of dish soap to it, and then add the ink in there. Mix, let it sit for a while until the suds die, and then fill. The dish soap should break up the surface tension of the ink, and help it flow better even in a Japanese Fine nib like your Pilot Metro. This should increase saturation (since you're getting more ink on the page) but also increases dry times and feathering on cheaper paper. Use with caution."

fountainpens,3dezs5,JonSzanto,2,Wed Jul 15 19:36:52 2015 UTC,And that really puts it over the edge into a bad ink. I made an impulse buy with my first pen and got a total of 200mL of chesterfield. I don't know what I'll do with it.
fountainpens,3dezs5,Oncotic,3,Wed Jul 15 20:12:34 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if a couple drops of Photo-flo or similar product (the kind of agents that are added to 'lubricating' inks) might help? I've not done this, save to one ink. If you do some searching, you'll find threads in various places about how to lubricate an ink. I believe food-grade glycerin is also a possibility.  Or, yeah, see if you can trade or sell it. If you like the color, though, that's enough ink to make it worthwhile to at least give a shot to some experimenting."
fountainpens,3dezs5,Oncotic,2,Wed Jul 15 19:36:22 2015 UTC,Just add some lubricant. Try and take a sample and mix dish soap into it. You can get it so runny that it comes out of the pen in blobs if you tried.
fountainpens,3dezs5,kindarusty,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:48:09 2015 UTC,any idea on sample size / drops.. IE 30ml/1 drop or is it a bit less finiky on that.
fountainpens,3dezs5,vintagenib,2,Wed Jul 15 19:53:52 2015 UTC,no idea. you might want to dilute the dish soap in water. A full drop would probably be too concentrated.  My uncle does it and says that's how he gets his dry inks to run.
fountainpens,3dezs5,dingledangles,2,Wed Jul 15 19:59:50 2015 UTC,"I've tried nearly all of the Chesterfield inks (three left to try, I think) and in my experience they're a bit... inconsistent, lubrication-wise. My bottle of Siam, for example, constantly gives me starting issues while the same color from my sample of the ink is better lubricated. (Likewise with the two Cobalt [I thought one was mis-labeled Amethyst; nope, Cobalt is just purple-ish.] samples I have: one is dry, the other not. Erinite, meanwhile, is the single driest ink I have ever used, while a friend says her sample is ""oily."")  Case in point: my bottle of Night Sapphire is very well-lubricated. In over a dozen pens (I love the color and sheen) I've not had a single starting issue. It seems I got lucky in the Chesterfield Lubrication Lottery.  That said, I'd second (third?) the suggestion of adding a lubricant if you like the color. (If you decide not to bother, though, if you ever decide to sell/trade/post it on P_S, I'd love a heads-up!)"
fountainpens,3dezs5,misslovcat,2,Wed Jul 15 21:15:04 2015 UTC,"I've had great luck with most of them, on the other hand. My bottle of Night Sapphire is perfect -- it's easily one of my favorite inks from this line, beautiful shading and great flow. I also really like Xircon, Archival Vault (in a super wet pen, anyway), and Turquoise.  Some of them are dry (Amethyst, Erinite, and Archival Vault stick out in my mind), and some just do not like certain pens. Not sure if this is a QC thing, or if it's just the nature of the inks.  But yeah, don't throw it away! Put a bit in a vial and play around with soap ratios, or just sell it if you don't want to mess with it. I'm sure there are plenty of us who would be willing to give it a good home, haha."

fountainpens,3db1ut,duffydavid,3,Wed Jul 15 01:55:16 2015 UTC,And they say they are made in Taiwan.
fountainpens,3db1ut,hiitan,5,Wed Jul 15 04:14:02 2015 UTC,"Even closer, $27 shipping to Japan. Sigh. I guess I will wait to see if anyone local here will stock these pens at any point..."
fountainpens,3db1ut,duffydavid,7,Wed Jul 15 06:20:03 2015 UTC,I find it amazing that you are not overwhelmed by stationery and inks in Japan already but it is hilarious that TWSBI is inaccesible there as well.
fountainpens,3db1ut,hiitan,3,Wed Jul 15 06:58:41 2015 UTC,"I found one online store that sells TWSBI without an insane markup, so I recently got my first one. Not sure if they will ever carry newer TWSBIs, doesn't look like it's updated very often sadly.  On a similar note, I'm glad people are enjoying Bungbox inks but I wish their international popularity would die down a little because I cannot get any of their ink locally since it's all snapped up internationally as soon as it's made >_<"
fountainpens,3db1ut,vermilions,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:15:12 2015 UTC,How could international ppl snatch them up so quick even locals couldn't get them!?
fountainpens,3db1ut,hiitan,2,Wed Jul 15 07:31:31 2015 UTC,"Tbf, I'm not exactly stalking their web store... But every time I look, all the inks are out of stock. First with the reddit group buys basically milking them dry.. And now with that Massdrop thing, I'm guessing there won't be much left over after those ship. Maybe I should make note to check next time there's a BB group buy here on reddit, maybe then I'll get lucky and there will be ink available... @_@;;  edit: I just checked and they posted an official announcement that they now decided to start limiting orders of most colours to 4 bottles per household per month (from a 6-month turnaround, accept all orders scenario). Still, it seems the inks are currently in (limited) stock so I should probably jump on that soon."
fountainpens,3db1ut,vermilions,2,Wed Jul 15 07:42:12 2015 UTC,Oh there's an online shop... Explains it.  I thought it was just a brick and mortar store! Excuse my lack of knowledge... I've yet to venture into much Japanese inks... Only Namiki Black and Sailor Jentle Souten and their pigment blue and black. For now! Hope you get your bung box inks soon!
fountainpens,3db1ut,slorilla,2,Wed Jul 15 08:19:13 2015 UTC,egads!  Why buy TWSBI if you live in Japan!?  Envious of all the bounty that is available to you.

fountainpens,3db1ut,whichversionofme,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:09:15 2015 UTC,"The point I think he is making is that practically all companys ship from their manufacturer or close by. It doesnt make sense to make the product, package it and sent to a shop distributor half way across the world just so they can ship it to the customer right? Doing that is very inefficient and the product ends up more expensive than it should be because the indirect shipping prices will be passed on to the customer."

fountainpens,3db1ut,rockydbull,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:13:03 2015 UTC,Are people getting ink on their fingers from the section? Or just seeing ink in the section on the demonstrator variants?
fountainpens,3db1ut,AwesomeBrainPowers,4,Wed Jul 15 04:06:47 2015 UTC,Ink collects in the sections and is near impossible to get out even using an ultra sonic cleaner

fountainpens,3db1ut,dotparty,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:52:11 2015 UTC,Even after removing the nib and feed? Is there other hardware inside the section that allows the ink to collect?
fountainpens,3db1ut,Tzun,0,Wed Jul 15 18:23:12 2015 UTC,Yes.The section is integrated via a thread and the ink collects there. Until we get close up review shots we wont know how twsbi has shaped the section or if it causes a problem.

fountainpens,3db1ut,JDAndChocolatebear,0,Wed Jul 15 18:28:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hadn't realized the section was integrated until now.  At first, I saw the pic and assumed the section (including the inner bit that directly sleeves the feed [I'm sure it has a name that I don't know]) was simply clear, and I almost bought one just for that.  Now, I'm assuming the Eco won't take TWSBI's other nib units, and that halted me dead in my tracks, one click away from submitting my order."

fountainpens,3ddidb,Ineverlosethegame,5,Wed Jul 15 12:36:01 2015 UTC,"This is why I love Pelikan, because of their simplicity in nomenclature. With the exception of the M3xx, the increase in size as their first number grows. The M3xx line is their smallest, followed my the M1xx, then M2xx and M4xx (which are the same size). Once you get to the M8xx series, the piston filler changes slightly. It becomes brass, and can aslo be removed, whereas with the lower numbered one, they are plastic and cannot be removed / repaired easily. Personally, I have a wide range of Pelikans, from ol M150s to brand new M1000s. The ones I use the most are my M215s and my M400s. The bigger the pen, the bigger the pen. They become harder to pocket more than 1 of them, and they become a little unwieldy. I have huge hands and my biggest somplaint about the smaller pens is the weight, which is why the M215, which is made out of brass, is my favorite. Hope this helps!"
fountainpens,3ddidb,johnbmason,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:22:18 2015 UTC,Can you talk about your 215 some more? I held both the 200 and 215 in a store and I liked the feel and weight of the 215. I didn't realize it was from the brass. Is the filling system brass or the barrel?
fountainpens,3ddidb,gokuak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:53:47 2015 UTC,"So, the M200 and M205 aren't made the way most people think. The colored bit is a sleeve that is fixed to a clear plastic tube. The piston mechanism is then inserted and glued into place. With the M215s, the part of the barrel you touch is made of a heavier resin applied to a thin layer of metal. After the engraving marks are made, the entire thing is sealed with a clear lacquer.  Then, instead of a clear tube, a brass one is inserted, giving it most of its extra weight. This assembly is then attached to the dark piece of plastic that serves as the ink viewing window.  The mechanisms are almost identical, with the exception of the blind cap having brass in it, an extra metal sleeve that shows when the pen is empty, and a few other reinforced metal parts.  I'm currently awaiting the M215 released in 2005, which will complete my M215 collection."

fountainpens,3ddidb,gokuak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:45:25 2015 UTC,"Sort of. There are a few special editions, like the M640, something like that, that have metal barrels, but they don't have a specific number to them...all of the normal ones are resin and lacquer,  and celluloid."

fountainpens,3ddidb,DarkLordChuckles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:01:56 2015 UTC,"Heh...no, you can't disassemble an M215, found that one out the hard way.

fountainpens,3ddidb,johnbmason,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:32:12 2015 UTC,"Reason I ask is because I was looking to buy from a website Pen Chalet and they list it as the Pelikan Soveran 400 and list it as 100% authentic and new.

fountainpens,3ddidb,DarkLordChuckles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:04:54 2015 UTC,"Brand new, cheapest I've found is either through Melpens.com or through eBay from a seller called missing-pen.  Personally, I use Niche Pens, out of the UK, more than anything. They are very fast and very accommodating.   As far as a vintage goes, start with a 140. They can be had for 50 to 150 on ebay all the time. I am currently courting a 400nn in tortoise right now. Currently at 140 something. Anything under 200 is worth it for me.

fountainpens,3ddidb,johnbmason,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:14:53 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for helping a newbie and not patronizing me for not knowing things. I will PM you about the nib shortly.
fountainpens,3ddidb,DarkLordChuckles,5,Thu Jul 16 03:16:57 2015 UTC,"Also the m8xx and m1xxx have brass filling systems while the m1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx and 6xx have plastic filling systems. The 1xx and 2xx typically come with steel nibs although I believe the 250? has a gold nib. The 3xx, 4xx, and 6xx have 14k nibs. In addition there are various naming differences. For example an m400 has gold trim but the m405 has rhodium trim. This is generally true for all of the pens (I'm sure there may be an exception). Other than that and a few other special numbering cases it is mainly the size although the nib gets bigger in the 8xx and 1xxx."
fountainpens,3ddidb,YeOldeSeaMoose,4,Wed Jul 15 13:50:10 2015 UTC,That's a pretty accurate assessment of the landscape.
fountainpens,3ddidb,pelikansperch,5,Wed Jul 15 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the M2xx line as well.  It's the same size as as the M400 but has steel nibs and different material for the body.  The M215 series uses a metal body with an additional brass insert inside to provide more weight to the pen.  My favorite Pelikan nib is in fact their steel nibs.  I purchased my M215 last.  I'd heard about the quality of Pelikan's steel nibs, but I found it hard to believe that the steel nibs could compare to the gold nibs.  Sure enough, not only is the steel nib comparable, I'd go as far as saying it's a superior experience.  Just as smooth as the 14k and 18k nibs I have, but it has more give similar to my Pilot nibs.  Which is what I prefer.  The difference between a Mxxx pen and an Mxx5 pen is silver instead of gold accents.  The difference between a Mxxx pen and an MxXx pen is a unique body style.  Like the M215.  It has a metal body compared to plastic of the M200 and M205.  Or the M640 vs M600.  The m640 has a totally different body style and material.    The first digit indicates size, the middle digit indicates a unique model if it's not a 0, and a 5 at the end indicates silver accents.    Also keep in mind that when it comes to size, it's not just the length that's different, but also the girth of the grip section.  This makes as much if not a greater difference than overall length.  There's just enough of a difference between an M40x/M60x/M80x girth that I find the M600 to be my preferred girth.  The weight of the brass piston in the M80x also makes a very noticeable difference in everyday use.  The weight of the pen makes it less comfortable for me to use in long writing sessions compared to the M600.  On the other hand, the M400 is so light and small, that it feels too small.  The M215's metal body adds just enough weight that it's a more pleasant experience.  But again, the girth of the grip section still isn't my ideal size.    Also keep in mind that the M200/400/600 write very well posted.  The M800 is unwieldy posted unless you have very large hands.  The m200/400 are less comfortable unposted unless you have very small hands.  The M600 I think writes well posted or unposted.  So for me the ideal Pelikan is an M60x with a steel nib.  The steel nibs are much plainer to look at so I haven't gotten around to buying spare nibs to swap out with my 4 M60x's.  In this picture, you can see how the M400 section tapers down a little bit more towards the nib compared to the M600 and how much bigger the M800 is as well:  http://i.imgur.com/p976uax.jpg  M215:  http://i.imgur.com/yAZtjiq.jpg  Hope some of this info was helpful."

fountainpens,3dd6qa,acropolis_rat,2,Wed Jul 15 10:29:33 2015 UTC,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but..   That doesn't look like it has the original nib - and whatever nib it does have is clearly a bit misaligned and sticks out a bit too far. It's possible that this pen's been repaired or tinkered with. As the nib sticks out so far I would be careful putting the cap on / tightening it, as it's possible the tip of the nib could catch on the inside of the cap.  Reseating the nib is a bit of a tricky/fiddly job, so it might be best left to a professional if you don't have much experience.   In other respects, it looks like a pretty pen, though!"
fountainpens,3dd6qa,BrianAndersonPens,2,Wed Jul 15 15:14:20 2015 UTC,"I agree, does not look correct, and certainly not in all the way.  Could it be used?  Sure, possibly, but Vac arrow nibs are super easy to come by.  OP should be careful resetting the nib, those sections are notorious for slight shrinkage and a tight fitting nib/feed.  Too much force will split the section."

It's an unnecessary callback to times when we couldn't make stainless steel (and reminds me of some of the cheap, awful nibs that were made in that era), and it's just asking for trouble if you keep it for more than a couple decades. Give me a steel nib over a gold plated nib any day.  I still maintain that solid gold makes a difference, though, although I wish there was an easier way to make nibs feel like that now that the price of gold is so high."
fountainpens,3dd30b,Hedgehogs4Me,2,Wed Jul 15 21:32:40 2015 UTC,That couldn't be it but I don't want them personally. I think often gold nibs feel different to steel nibs and both have their place. The bounce on many gold nibs is great for slightly slower writing but for faster writing and daily driver use steel seems harder to spring and being a nail (independent of the material used but common in steel) makes writing faster a bit more natural

fountainpens,3dd3w4,SharnaRanwan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:19:19 2015 UTC,"Denim is my very first ink. I ordered it together with my first better pen (always used Al-Stars, since 2nd grade), and chose it solely from internet pictures and descriptions because I needed some ink unti lmy sampler arrived. So happy with my choice, and I will use up that whole bottle and I will always have a pen with it (once I have enough pens)."
fountainpens,3dd3w4,chicacherrycolalime,2,Wed Jul 15 17:23:13 2015 UTC,I have yet to meet a better blue black ink.
fountainpens,3dd3w4,SharnaRanwan,2,Wed Jul 15 23:57:59 2015 UTC,"Diamine Ancient Copper is a really rich color that I love, and Oxblood is great too. Saddle Brown is a nice, soft brown with good shading.   De Atramentis Alexander Hamilton and Aubergine are both really fantastic purples. I would have already bought a bottle of Alexander Hamilton, but both of those inks bleed pretty badly, enough that I can't use them. Sherlock Holmes is a really, really pretty blue-black that doesn't bleed. I also loved Frankincense, a pretty grey, wet and good shading, and not very prone to bleeding."
fountainpens,3dd3w4,goodnewsblues,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:18:40 2015 UTC,I mean hey if you can't use the Alexander Hamilton I'd gladly take that off your hands.... I find that Leuchttrum 1917 notebooks hold the ink quite well. The grid dots notebooks are my personal favorite.
fountainpens,3dd3w4,burrgerwolf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:26:23 2015 UTC,"I just had a sample of it. I wanted to buy a bottle, but couldn't justify it with all the bleed. I haven't tried the Leuchtturme books. They look really nice, but kind of expensive..."

fountainpens,3dd3w4,SharnaRanwan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:59:30 2015 UTC,"Not a huge difference. Alexander Hamilton is a little lighter and less saturated (has slightly better shading). I like AH a bit better than Aubergine, but they are similar and both beautiful purples."

Their pens range in price from a low of $400 all the way up to $3,000 or more.  Paul Rossi and Brad Torelli are also well-known for their luxury custom pens.

fountainpens,3dcpwu,Diabolical_Engineer,2,Wed Jul 15 06:20:54 2015 UTC,"I was rebuilding this Parker VS this evening and thought I would share the process. The VS is an odd pen produced by Parker in the late 40's. This particular example is from 1947 and has several features unique to the early VS. First, even though button fillers had been around for decades, it uses an unusual one piece threaded button assembly instead of the traditional button. Second, it has a clear lucite feed. Both of these features were discontinued on later pens ( The lucite feed due to staining, and the novel button due to increased production cost.) The VS was not a popular pen and was only produced for a couple of years, but is a neat little piece of Parker history."

The nib is an adjustable nib, signature to the line and very rare, though yours is in a different style than the usual.  The blindcap that screws off on the end extends to fill the pen when submerged in ink, and the lever on the feed can used to shut off ink flow.

fountainpens,3d9ip6,nndi,9,Tue Jul 14 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"It should just pull out on a thin metal rod, like in this image. Does the blind cap just come off, or is it still connected to the rod? It may be stuck due to ink (particularly if it was working recently), or some other failure with the filling system. I would not try to force it too hard as to not damage it.  The plunger fill versions of these pens are very difficult to repair. For such a valuable pen, both monetarily and presumably sentimentally, I would get in contact with a professional to have it repaired and appraised. Pentiques, Main Street Pens, and  Rick Horne are a couple options in the US."

Before going any further, I'd urge you to read up on the pen on these pages from Richard Binder's site.

fountainpens,3d9y5a,Cataplexic,3,Tue Jul 14 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"Here's an interesting experiment you can try:  Fill a Lamy Safari with BSB, use it until it runs out, then dip the nib in water, and refill with just water.  The remaining ink in the pen will gradually dilute itself out into the water.  You are left with a shockingly nice periwinkle color (although it has the consistency of water, so that Lamy nib is gonna be really scratchy).  But the really interesting part is that you can see the color change almost immediately this way, from a purple color when the ink is wet to a blue color when the ink is dry.  I notice the color change too when I'm using straight ink, looking at old writing compared to new writing.  Watered down, it's a more dramatic change."

fountainpens,3daw4m,Hedgehogs4Me,6,Tue Jul 14 22:04:21 2015 UTC,"The thing you have to be careful with when you're looking at Watermans is that Waterman made a wide variety of nibs and had various options for flexibility. If an online antique dealer is selling you a 52 and they just say ""it has a gold nib"" and nothing else, you're taking a risk. If someone says exactly how flexible theirs is, in an auction it can jump past 100 easily.  You can get some good deals on 52 1/2s though, if you like small pens."
fountainpens,3daw4m,rlcdavidson,3,Tue Jul 14 22:28:49 2015 UTC,"For the best thing under 100 you're probably looking at vintage semiflex, which is pretty on par with modern flex for the most part. I believe you can still get a restored Eversharp Skyline for that, but remember that you're looking for the regular (medium?) nibs, not the manifold fine, since manifold nibs are designed to write through carbon paper to make multiple copies, and are therefore less flexible. There are also a lot of second and third tier names and such that you could get for less, but sometimes you get a good one and sometimes you don't - for example, one of my smoothest soft nibs is an Eagle eyedropper, but would I buy another Eagle? Maybe, but only because of my experience with the first one. It's that sort of thing.  For the record, I have an Ahab, and it's fun, but it is a hobby pen. It's not the sort of thing you'd necessarily want to write long notes with, although I do with mine after some heavy modding - and even then I prefer my other flexible pens but sometimes I'm afraid to use them or want to use a more staining ink or something like that.  Apparently FPR also has some somewhat flexible options, on par with what Noodler's offers. Might be worth checking out. If you go for this or a Noodler's, though, you'll probably want to at the very least do an ease my flex type modification to really experience what the flex is about. Even supposedly rigid vintage pens can sometimes be as flexible as what I got from both my stock Ahab and the spare nib I ordered for it. There's also another dude here who did both an EMF type mod as well as tomahawked his Ahab nib. I'm looking to do a similar thing eventually if I can get access to a dremel again.  Many people here also replace their Jinhao x450 or x750 nibs with a Titanium Zebra comic G nib, which offers some flex - I haven't tried it myself because someone lost my x750 in his appartment (damn it Mark, clean your floor already), but the overall cost there for a couple Jinhaos (in case one is a little shoddy or doesn't fit or something, which some people find), plus a pack of Titanium G nibs (they will wear out eventually, but will take quite a while to do so because of the titanium, so a pack is a good investment) is going to be somewhere in the vicinity of $50. You might even get two fully working pens out of that.  Also, not to toot my own horn or anything, but I do also have a couple BCHR 14k nib semiflex pens from the 20s that I'd be willing to sell for quite a bit under 100, hehe."

However, the nib writes very well, doesn't have any flow issues for me, and now has flex-y powers! Cost of project: Muji pen $12 (ebay) + fpr 5.5 flex nib $10 = $22.

Cheap, and super flexy. $5 for a holder, $1-2 for a nib (Brause Rose, Brause 66EF, Brause ""blue pumpkin,"" or a Zebra G) and you have all the flex you could ever want. You just have to keep dipping the pen, that's the gotcha. Also, dip nibs can be a little on the scratchy side. An oblique holder will help you get a proper flex on slanted downstrokes, which is also cheap. Edit: I know this is /r/fountainpens, but it's just a starter suggestion.

There's no cool toys, no crazy setups to emulate, and too much of the floor space is now dedicated to mini-stores with Apple, Samsung and Windows getting their own space.   What bugs me is that their store is filled with low-margin products, with only a handful of stuff they could actually make money from. Computers, phones, smartwatches, TVs, tablets, printers and speakers are all going to give them a few percentage points of the price in profit. So how exactly are they staying in business?

Last I heard, Vanness does not anticipate being able to restock their colors until December.  The other thing to note, however, is that if you participate in the drop, you will not get the ink in the 8-sided bottle. It will come in a regular Sailor Jentle 50ml round bottle."

fountainpens,3d979s,NotClever,3,Tue Jul 14 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"With tax and shipping it's over $40 a bottle. I can get most any premium ink from Amazon for $20-ish; even at Goulet, few inks break the $30-per-bottle barrier, especially at 50ml/bottle. You can get the more popular J Herbin inks for $20-ish for 100ml/bottle, and the fancy German and Japanese inks for about twice the cost $-to-ml. This ink is stratospheric-ally expensive; I could see maybe if you were just THAT IN LOVE with a color (dandyism and witch tears are both calling to me); but if you can wait a bit, or swing an order through Japan or something, you could save a lot of money. I'm sure it's all about what you can afford for luxury and hobby items, and how much convenience you're willing to pay for.  These orders won't be filled until early September; they say so on the Massdrop listing page. yagankiely pointed out elsewhere in this thread/topic that Bungbox will make orders available internationally in October for $60/two bottles, shipping included. So the extra $10 bottle only gets you about a month ahead of everyone else, it would seem."

fountainpens,3d979s,benbincanada,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:50:21 2015 UTC,"You can buy them for cheaper; if you want the ease and convenience of Massdrop, though, it's about $40/bottle after tax and shipping.

Lately I've been craving a big pen (I have large hands) with a BIG NIB, and spent a lot of time researching both the Pilot Custom 823, and occasionally looking at ads for vintage 149's.    Then, somehow I won auctions for both!  Whoops!  At least both were fantastic deals.  The Pilot was new, and just needed some tuning to increase the flow.  The 149 is, I believe, from the 80's, and was a big risky gamble on a brand new eBayer from Spain with a bare bones description (""Montblanc 149.  Used once."").  But, it arrived minty except for a small chip in the cap.  Needed a good flush to get out old ink, the tines were badly misaligned, and the flow was dry.  But after some TLC, she's a beauty and writing quite nicely.  Definitely worth what I paid, and am happy with my purchase.  It writes quite nicely now with an improved flow, smooth but with some feedback.  Nib has some definite ""give"" to it for line variation.  I do have to say, though, that I am absolutely smitten with my Custom 823 and currently prefer it (though I haven't had a chance to really spend some quality time with the 149).  The 149 is a legend.  But the 823… man… that pen is just something special.    I paid around $300 for my 149.  I would not recommend paying any more than that.  At the end of the day it is a big black plastic pen.  Huge, beautiful nib, yes, but not a mind-blowing writing experience.  IMO the 823 is a mind-blowing pen, especially for the price.  And at the price of retail, or even half retail 149's, there are many, many better options.  The end!"

fountainpens,3d8hki,rockydbull,2,Tue Jul 14 21:47:41 2015 UTC,"Hi - when you say ""too slow"", do you mean that it railroads when you flex it?  Or that it just writes dry overall?  If it's railroading that is a problem of the feed not being able to keep up with the flex, and that unfortunately is a common issue with Pilot feeds and their flexible nibs, and can't really be remedied.  However if it is writing too dry overall, I have found the following order of adjustments to work best for me, starting from conservative to more aggressive.  You need 2 items - brass sheets (can be ordered from Goulet or Andersonpens.  I actually prefer the Anderson pens ones as they're a little thicker), and a loupe.   1 - Take a brass shim and floss the tines, taking the corner of the shim, inserting it into the breather hole, and moving down to the tip.  This generally doesn't do much but clean out the channel. 2 - Insert the shim in between the tines and just leave it there for 10 minutes or longer.  If that doesn't help, double or triple up on the shims, inserting them and leaving them in between the tines for increasing periods of time, testing as you go.   3- Generally it comes down to this step, especially with 14K nibs, because 14K nibs are ""springy"", and by their very nature, can spread without having a permanent effect.  The above step of just leaving the shims in there generally only work for steel nibs, or higher karat pens (like Sailor's 21K).   Take a brass shim and insert it in between the tines - ideally you want the nib out of the pen, and thankfully with the 823 you can remove the nib and feed (friction fit).  Move the nib down so that it is about halfway dow the shim, then fold over the shim in your fingers, grabbing each end with one hand, and holding the back of the nib firmly in your other hand. (Gently at first) tug in each direction (left and right) to spread the tines apart.  Use your loupe to look at the gap as you go.  You don't want to overdo it because decreasing flow is a lot harder than increasing (but can be done).  Again, the 14K nib on the 823 can be stubborn, because it's made to be somewhat flexible.  I found the greatest success by pulling one way, holding, counting to 5, then pulling the other way, counting to 5, and repeating.     Because this method is more aggressive, and getting the perfect horizontal angle on your tugs is difficult, there is a high probability you will misalign the tines.  Once the flow is where you want it, simply adjust the tines back into alignment with your loupe.    It might sound terrifying, and it was for me the first time I did it, but honestly once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy to adjust your own nibs."

fountainpens,3d8hki,jordanjay29,2,Tue Jul 14 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"Ah.  Well first you want to make sure the rear plunger knob is unscrewed all the way before writing.  If it goes completely dry - as in not writing at all, then the feed is getting starved.  If it just starts writing dry, then you probably need to adjust the nib for increased flow."
fountainpens,3d8hki,rockydbull,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:47:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it starts writing not too wet, but definitely not too dry. Rear knob unscrewed (not all the way, but generous two millimeters like the instructions say). After writing a bit, it goes dry, then recovers if I let it rest some time. : /  edit: Just took a ruler to the gap after unscrewing the rear knob. Turns out it is only then two millimeters wide, if I really unscrew it all the way. Tested the pen that way and: Yay! : ) It writes much, much better!"
fountainpens,3d8hki,NotClever,2,Wed Jul 15 10:17:17 2015 UTC,Nice!  Yup I read on FPN that you really need to unscrew the knob all the way until it's spinning freely.  Glad it fixed the problem for you.

The 823 posts deeper than the 149 - I write comfortably with the 823 posted, but the 149 posted is a little overboard, even for my big hands.  I paid around $160 + shipping from Japan for the 823.

fountainpens,3daxi3,Ineverlosethegame,5,Tue Jul 14 21:25:59 2015 UTC,"I would not personally recommend jumping from a first pen Lamy Safari to a $400 pen.  Higher price ≠ better writing experience for you. No offense intended, but you honestly do not have enough pen experience to be able to be confident that a pen at that price range would be a good fit for you (unless, of course, you have a brick and mortar shop you can walk into), and it would be a shame to request a ""be all to end all"" pen and be disappointed.  You could get lucky - but just saying it took me a long while and many, many pens to figure out what I really like in a pen.  My suggestion, since you like your Lamy, is to get a Lamy 2000.  It's a safe bet and a big step up from the Safari, and also a brand you're familiar with (as far as nib widths go).  It is also one of my very favorite pens, and is A LOT smoother writer than my Montblanc, and fits the preferences you listed."

fountainpens,3daxi3,Fade_0,2,Tue Jul 14 21:50:29 2015 UTC,Ok so i just read your post and realised that you going from a safari to this. I recommend you get one or two cheaper pens. What pen styles do you like? More classic style like montblanc or something like a waterman carene?   If i was in your position i would get myself a pilot vp definitely and either a carene or a platinum 3776 although that one might be a bit fine since they are Japanese nibs. Also i have heard good things about sailor but i do not own one and the lamy 2000 which is a great pen but i just find it too ugly to have kept so i sold it off but you might fancy the looks.  You could also get some nice inks and some good paper (i recommend clairfontain since this is by far the best paper in terms of smoothness and bleed through/feathering/show through
fountainpens,3daxi3,HansSachs,2,Wed Jul 15 01:17:58 2015 UTC,"I own a Pilot Justus 95. The pen is $312 on Goulet, but you can find it cheaper on eBay or private sellers. The pen is pretty cool, and can change from hard to soft. Plus the pen is gorgeous and big, but not too big. The pen is pretty nice!  Though if you want something special, maybe look into a very well restored vintage pen, and then send it to a nib meister and have it made exactly how you want it to write. Vintage pens just feel.. better while holding them. Like they have more of a story, more meaning. I have a Parker Vacumatic with a nib from 1945 and a body fro 1946. That's amazing to me. Thinking about getting an Eversharp Skyline next, they are super pretty :)  For $400 you could also get a Pelikan or Montblanc pen, which are both very solid choices. Good luck on your hunt!"

fountainpens,3daxi3,ColloquiaIism,2,Wed Jul 15 00:12:36 2015 UTC,I would strongly recommend looking at a Pelikan m800 or m1000 depending on which size pen would be more comfortable in your hand.  They have great solid gold nibs and their build quality is such that they could last a lifetime or more.  You could even buy a replacement nib in the future if you decide that you wish to try another nib size.  I own many $400 plus pens but my M800 sees more time as my daily carry than any other.  It also survived a fall unscathed that would have been doom for Montblanc's previous resin.  I recommend Pen-House in Japan if you want to buy a Pelikan.  They have terrific prices and great service.  The only problem is that if you need warranty service in your home country it may not be possible since you would be ordering from overseas.  Good luck!  edit: I forgot to mention the Pilot Custom 845.  It's their highest end of the custom series with black urushi lacquer on the barrel and a large $15 nib.  It's worth considering.  Pen-house has them as well.
fountainpens,3daxi3,Fade_0,2,Tue Jul 14 22:56:57 2015 UTC,"Build quality that would last a lifetime is exactly what I'm looking for. I will most definitely look into your suggestions. Thank you very much, nice collection."
fountainpens,3daxi3,The_Doculope,2,Tue Jul 14 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"100% agree. I settled on Pelikan after owning a few different kinds. I am currently using a M800 in classic green/black that looks and writes better than when it was new, about 18 years ago. Nibs do run fat compared to Japanese brands, I find 'F' very comfortable."

On the image where the clip is facing away you can see that the binde - the plastic barrel - has a variation in color where the two ends of flat plastic sheet have been wrapped around their form and joined to make a cylinder.

Certainly you can post the cap on some pens pretty firmly so that they shouldn't come lose, even without clicking.  For example, on a Kaweco Sport, the cap is posted very deeply, and I don't know how your pen could accidentally roll away from it.  Pilot pens also post firmly with quite a bit of friction, even though not as deeply as a Kaweco Sport.  The friction when posting may actually be greater than with some clicking caps."

fountainpens,3dbjh7,hiitan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:31:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it is not as great of a thing as you think it is. I have couple pens that do it. The motion of posting a pen is very different from capping it. When you post a pen, typically, the cap fits on shallower on the barrel than it does on the section. You don't actually post with your thumb but rather with your other fingers because the cap extends too far out to make posting with your thumb comfortable without having to seriously alter your hand positioning. With this shallower entry you have a greater field of angular motion, causing in the sides of the barrel chinging with interior cap more frequently. Basically, it feels weird, and my concern is that such a trick often scuffs the barrel, making me not want to post it at all.   If you want to know, though, the two pens that I have that reliably do it are an Inoxcrom Riviera and a Charles-Hubert Tweed Cross Hatch fountain pen. It also appears that Charles-Hubert has multiple pens with this sort of click-on-back mechanism. However, both pens do not have what I consider as a ""satisfying click"" caused by moderate resistance and a loud click. Instead I get the feeling that is more of a ""meh click,"" no resistance and a quiet click."

I tested it with my finger using both plain Amodex and water then Amodex, and the water really does seem to ruin the effect. Tested with Noodler's Black and Diamine Syrah (interestingly one of the ingredients of Syrah comes out way better than the rest, making it change colour before fully coming out).  I'm glad you had success with water, though. It just... puzzles me. Maybe the spot stick is even more magic."

Of course, I only figured this out after working with it for a while. I will definitely check out Amodex, though! I have two massive cats that like to get themselves into trouble so I imagine I will need out in the future.   Honestly, I think the biggest thing was I kept everything soaking wet. Which sounds crazy but the water is really what saved me."

Here's why - and it isn't necessarily about filing patents, it could also be about proving that you were using an idea before it was patented.  I'm 100% FP with these books. I've used Mont Blanc Blue/Black, several Platinum shades, Noodlers' in various varieties and currently diamine - zero bleed through, zero feather. This is heavyweight, lightly textured paper intended for being used on both sides."

I use those for my personal projects and in my research at the university.  For my day job, I work with multiple agencies on a number of different projects.  For that work, I need a single pad of paper that I can take notes on, sketch on, etc. and then either put it in a binder or a file that is associated with that group or project.  There aren't any IP issues to worry about here - we all work for the state and it owns all of our IP related to our jobs anyway.  Plus, having single pages means that before I file it away, I can run it through my desktop scanner and have an electronic copy on my cloud drive so I don't have to carry paper around with me."

I write with a Lamy Safari Fine nib or a Pilot Metropolitan fine nib, both loaded up with Noodler's 54th Massachusetts. No issues with feathering, and no bleed though with the Pilot. There's on occasion a little bleed through with the Lamy, but it's not that you're using the back of engineering paper anyway. As long as you're not just resting your pen on the paper, it's fine.  The National paper is good with pencils and erasing too. . .if that's at all important."

They have sent it to Heidelberg, Germany and it got repaired. I didn't receive any bill. The 'problem' of the 2k series is that Lamy doesn't provide spare parts (I needed a section). The pen has to be repaired by Lamy themselves. Therefore the 2k series is different to the other series and therefore I think it has the lifetime warranty."

fountainpens,3d9ho5,reubenco,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:11:43 2015 UTC,"If your Metro F isn't done enough to prevent most feathering, it might be worth looking into the EF Pilot Penmanship nib. With a little tinkering you can take both nibs out and swap them, and that nib is probably the finest nib you can get for that price anywhere (with the exception of dip nibs)."

I've loaded it into my Metro, and it's serving me very well so far. The only notebook I have that it feathers on is one I bought from Woot, and EVERYTHING feathers on that (Salix won't bleed through it, though). Aside from being mindful to clean it out of my pens more frequently than I would (it's iron gall), it's easily the most utilitarian ink in my repertoire. It's also highly water resistant, and possibly magic. **"

fountainpens,3d8c54,ckekc,5,Tue Jul 14 08:16:45 2015 UTC,"Hi - I've owned several metros, 92's (in both F and MF), and a 742 in SF.  Here are my thoughts for you:   As /u/reubenco says, the 92's fine does run broader than the metro's.   Pilot's MF nib is way closer to Medium than it is to Fine (whereas Sailor's MF is closer to a ""true"" medium-fine).  I got a CH92 in MF and found it to be too broad for me. I currently own a CH92 in fine that I adore and is my #1 EDC.  But I only started adoring it after it was adjusted for increased flow.   On that note, all the nibs on my Custom Heritage pens have arrived writing too dry for my taste, and with a lot of feedback.  I have had to either adjust the flow myself, or have it adjusted professionally.  This can be easily done via brass shims bought from goulet or anderson pens. Truthfully, owning many hundreds of dollars in pens, the metropolitans are some of my smoothest.  I find their nibs smoother than my Custom Heritages, even after increased flow.  Not more enjoyable, but smoother (less feedback).  Part of this is because, with a springy gold nib, the tines are prone to separating during strokes and thus can create more feedback than a stiff steel nib.  The other reason is that Pilot ships their metros writing wetter than their CH series pens.  Not sure why this is.  I read somewhere that the reason may be because the metro is targeted specifically for Western markets and our style of writing, whereas the CH series pens, especially the fine nibs, are more targeted for Kanji writing.  Just hearsay. The SF nib on my 742 was really nice.  It was still a very fine nib, if I recall finer than the standard fine, but it was smooth with some excellent flexibility.   If I were you I would go for the CH 92 in Fine, order some brass shims and a loupe with it, and increase flow if needed.  It is such a fantastic all-arounder."
fountainpens,3d8c54,slorilla,2,Tue Jul 14 09:53:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! This is exactly what I was looking for. Once I have the funds saved up, I'll go ahead and get either the SF or the F nib.   In regards to my Metro, I haven't really been too satisfied with the nib that came on it. My first one fell out of my bag during lecture, and I really had grown to love that one. The nib finally had adjusted to my writing, and it was giving me good results. But the nib on my replacement has been underwhelming and is scratchy in one direction.   Upon re-reading my original post, I think I was looking for wetter, not smoother."
fountainpens,3d8c54,reubenco,2,Tue Jul 14 10:34:28 2015 UTC,"I don't have an answer for you, but I can say that I believe Pilot's gold nibs do not skew as notoriously fine as the ones on the Metropolitans. i.e. a CH92 fine is not quite as fine as a Metropolitan fine. Have you looked on Goulet Pens's Nib Nook? There you can compare all the sizes of Metropolitan vs. CH92 vs. (probably) Goulet nibs."
fountainpens,3d9ub7,Ignor4nt,3,Tue Jul 14 16:59:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe before thicker tape, try Teflon ""plumber's tape"" to get a better seal. However, you should look closely at the cap to make certain it isn't cracked (which is what my guess would be). If it is, putting stuff on the threads would just expand the cap more and probably eventually break it. If it is cracked, you might try using a stopper made for wine bottles to keep it sealed."

fountainpens,3d88le,Jason_WFN,12,Tue Jul 14 07:28:40 2015 UTC,Springiness can be independent of material though. Sailor has gold nibs that are hard as nails. Personally I find the springiness troublesome on bad paper because a little pressure can cause more ink to come out and cause more feathering on certain letters.
fountainpens,3d88le,rockydbull,3,Tue Jul 14 07:51:49 2015 UTC,"Sailor has gold nibs that are hard as nails.   Just note that Sailor actually calls the nibs ""hard.""

fountainpens,3d88le,grand_royal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:49:37 2015 UTC,"Eh, maybe it's just because I've never used a super hard gold nib, but I feel like my gold nibs feel like they ""settle"" a bit when you put them to the paper.

fountainpens,3d88le,Hedgehogs4Me,9,Tue Jul 14 23:18:27 2015 UTC,"Saturation and shading are to do with inks and wetness. Nothing to do with nib material.   It's hard to generalise gold, steel, or titanium nibs, as every manufacturer uses a different alloy with different properties.  Smoothness is generally better with higher end pens, which tend to have gold nibs.  Gold nibs are usually softer than steel, as is titanium. There are many exceptions."

fountainpens,3d88le,ElencherMind,2,Tue Jul 14 11:18:31 2015 UTC,"Visconti's ""Smartouch"" tubular nibs are surprisingly springy. They use a chromium alloy but the springiness is due more to the nib shape than its material."
fountainpens,3d88le,jordanjay29,2,Tue Jul 14 14:03:40 2015 UTC,"Platinum's Balance/Cool nibs are reported to be rather soft, although this ""feature"" is not advertised by anyone but Brian Goulet."
fountainpens,3d88le,OverWilliam,2,Tue Jul 14 14:34:01 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I only have experience with the Fine Platinum Cool, not the Medium... but in my experience the line variation offered by the Platinum Balance nib series is really not even worthy of being called semi-flex. In normal, no-pressure writing there is virtually no ""spring"" or line expressiveness whatsoever, and it is only under some significant pressure that line variation is visible at all. In my opinion, this is due to the comparatively small nib size on the Cool/Balance models (as compared to, say, a standard #6 size nib). Even compared to Steel Indian-made nibs like those from Noodler's or Fountain Pen Revolution, the Cool really is not that soft at all (and I'm pretty sure I've started to spring mine just a little bit from repeatedly trying to get line variation out of it, with varying degrees of success). That's not too say that there isn't any line variation to be had--because there certainly is--but not more than you could squeeze out of even a $4 Jinhao nib once you apply that much pressure."
fountainpens,3d88le,jordanjay29,3,Tue Jul 14 15:27:13 2015 UTC,"Note: I said soft, not semi-flex. These are two very, very different things.   It's not that you get line variation. It's that the feel of the nib is a bit springy, and cushions your writing a bit."
fountainpens,3d88le,absolutenobody,2,Tue Jul 14 15:38:12 2015 UTC,"Some Pilots are offered with what the company terms a ""soft"" steel nib. Not flexible by any stretch of the imagination, but a little springy. Esterbrook made a steel (semi-)flex nib, and there are a fair few other vintage steel nibs with a bit of springiness to them. Wearever made a ""flexible fine"" nib for the Pennant that's not flexible but a little springy, as well."
fountainpens,3d88le,rockydbull,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:57:09 2015 UTC,I imagine the noodler semi flex would give the springiness of a gold nib. The variation is ever so slight and would not be considered flexing.
fountainpens,3d88le,jordanjay29,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:22:51 2015 UTC,"Can confirm that Noodler nibs, when written normally without intentional pressure, cause inadvertent line variation due to their semi-flex state."

Those are extremely soft, springy and flexible."
fountainpens,3d88le,edruro,2,Wed Jul 15 00:06:38 2015 UTC,"I think modern manufacture can do steel nibs than are as good as gold nibs. Also, it is important to note that gold was used as a necessity when steel was not as resistant to corrosion as nowadays. There's no reason to use gold in fountain pens if you can make steel as useful.  Said that, I also think that fountain pens with steel nibs are not as worthwhile as their gold counterparts. If you are going to spend money in an expensive fountain pen, you must go for gold nibs. Gold, even mediocre gold, is guaranteed to last a century or more. It is much more plausible for the rest of the pen to degrade beyond the point of normal function than for the nib itself. But with steel, you have no guarantee that the nib will stand the pass of time. I've seen stainless steel corrode within 10 years of use because of micro-defects on the plate that you can't see. I've also seen golden-plated steel being peel out of the golden plate with the pass of time. Sure, you can easily and cheaply replace steel nibs, but I'd prefer my Pelikan Toledo to last with the original nib as much as possible, given the price of it.  tl;dr: for everyday use, buy steel. For investment, buy gold."
fountainpens,3d88le,absolutenobody,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:53:47 2015 UTC,"The only tangible differences are that gold nibs cost more and are thinner, making them difficult to swap into pens that came with steel ones. (And vice-versa.)"
fountainpens,3d88le,Sundrah,0,Tue Jul 14 15:04:12 2015 UTC,What actually touches the paper is the tip of the nib. You can have a plastic nib for all anyone cares and as long as the tip is outstandingly spectacular you would still have the smoothest nib with the best properties in the world. Nib material is all up to personal choice.
fountainpens,3d88le,Fade_0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:35:04 2015 UTC,?????  You know that the nib splits/bends for flex right? If you tried to have a flex pen with plastic you'd literally crack it.
fountainpens,3d88le,Hedgehogs4Me,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"Not true, there have been very successful trial runs at making plastic Ahab nibs that are really, really, really flexy. Plastic can be, well, as the name suggests, very flexible. That being said, the plastic nibs have to be changed like every week and probably aren't great to write with.  There is more to the nib than the tipping, but I agree with Sundrah as far as that tipping is an underrated aspect of a nib. If you go far enough back you see pen manufacturers coming out with new crazy marketing angles for why their tipping lasts longer, writes better, whatever else than other companies' tipping materials, and that just doesn't exist anymore. With all the materials research breakthroughs we keep hearing about, I'm surprised that no one's stepped forward and said, ""Hey, remember when we brought you better tipping materials back in nineteen-shifty-four? Well, we're back with a new carbon-nano-speed-organic-silicone-future composite and it's included in this new model we're rolling out!""  Maybe we'll see that eventually, though. Who knows."

fountainpens,3d56ng,AmesCG,95,Mon Jul 13 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"I'll bite, it's a bit long winded, but I think the information is sound:  1) Must have tools - A good, and big ultrasonic.  I use a Crest HTA875 ultrasonic, holds around a half gallon of water, 35 minute timer, and most importantly, a drain.  If you seriously want to repair pens, you need a serious ultrasonic.  If your ultrasonic doesn't have a drain or is really tiny, it's going to get old quick when you have to keep changing the water.  I like the Crest so much, I have two of them.  For the weekend hobbiest or the person who just wants to repair their own pens, then those others are fine, but the 35 minute timer is a blessing, and the large water capacity means more parts and less frequent changes.  Ok, now that I'm off my soapbox about the ultrasonic (did I mention I love mine?  ;) )  Other tools:   You need two vacumatic tools.  One a hand held unit and a clamp style.  The hand held units are easy to use, but when you run across a 1942-43 filler (the black plastic ones) you almost always need a clamp style so you can lock it down tight, tighter than you could hold it. Other vacumatic tools that are helpful - a pellet pusher to get the new diaphragm in, a dremel and some bits to remove the old pellet, and some kind or pusher rod to push out the filler from the inside of the barrel (I had one made for me for the purpose) invest in an aluminum or other metal knockout block.  Yes the wood ones you make are ok, but might as well get one that will last forever. For Snorkels, you need a long screwdriver, and a small one (the kind you get in those screwdriver sets - about the size to work on glasses.  Also, you'll want a tool to help in getting the o-ring in the barrel.  Lots of options, but I use Dale BeBee's double ended snorkel/touchdown tool.  It goes in just far enough to prevent the o-ring from falling in to the barrel.  Also, get a thin strong long wire, something along the lines of a violin e-string, but stronger.  You can either buy these from the local music store, or you could even (if you ask nicely) get the broken ones they cut off.  Guitar strings will work to.  Music stores also have nylon brushes for brass instruments and woodwinds that work great for cleaning out caps.  You'll want a sac guard cleaning tool (Dale has these too) and some acetone (most nail polish remover has acetone in it) if you run across a snorkel with stuck sac remains inside the sac guard.  Silicone grease, of course, and a sealant for the barrel (I use original Sheaffer section sealant, but I think Ron Zorn sells a copy of it). Heat gun.  Not a hair dryer, a multi temperature heat gun.  I use a standard heat gun from the home improvement store.  LEARN what settings to use.  I use only the two lowest settings, and know how long to keep each part in the heat before trouble will result.  Yes a hair dryer will work, but this is about being efficient and using the right tool for the job.  The heat gun is the right tool. Nib setting pliers.  A necessity, especially when it comes to some vacumatic or other hard to fit feeds/nibs into sections.  These grab the nib and feed and then you can easily maneuver the section to fit. Buy books, lots of books.  Get Dubiel's book, get the Marshall/Oldfield book(s), buy the original Parker Vacumatic repair reprints,  Anything you can get your hands on. If by now you haven't been dissuaded, buy parts, lots of parts, any and every opportunity. You'll never use them all, but you never know when you will use them. Other items - q-tips, toothpicks, dental picks, a small sharp scissors,  small hemostat, several kinds of pliers, emory boards (lots of them!), towels, paper towels, grinding wheel, pocket knife, exacto knife, razor blades and probably a few other things I'm forgetting.   Tools that are nice to have but not necessary out of the gate:   Nib block - Yep, not necessary, and a substantial investment.  Learn the repairs first before venturing into nibs.  When you do get one, make sure to get several different burnishers. Parker 51 aerometric clamp - needed to hold on to the filling unit while removing the hood.  Handy, and you should have one, but unless you're tearing 51 aero's completely apart, might be able to get by without one. Parker 51/61 cap removal tools - Some of my favorite tools.  Expensive but again, not necessary to get a pen working properly.  If you get one, you need a bench vise to use them properly. Inner cap pullers - Not often that I have to pull an inner cap, and these can also get expensive.  When you get them, get multiple versions, because not all will work in all circumstances.  I have three different kinds and have used them all.   Understand that tools are an investment if you plan on doing this.  My rule of thumb is I figure any tool will cost me $250 (most don't and are fairly inexpensive, but add up a few $50 tools and it becomes substantial) and up to that amount I will just buy it if I need it.  Over that I look at what it will offer me.  Over time, they will pay for themselves time and time again.  I have invested thousands in tools.  2) Getting started - buy lots of pens.  Starting with Esterbrook is a good idea.  Dig around ""junk"" boxes at shows, buy broken stuff at antique malls and ebay.  Invest (notice I used the term ""invest"") in pens to help you learn.  Read aforementioned books front to back, and back to front.  Frequent the FPN repair forum.  Talk to people, go to pen shows and learn.  Be a sponge.  3) Polish - I use at least three different methods.  Micromesh wet sanding is one.  All 9 grits.  It takes a while, but the result speaks for itself.  If a vintage pen, sometimes I stop at 8000 because it looks more natural.  I use simichrome for a final polish on most plastic pens, and I have a bottle of generic mildly abrasive polish (I think it was a Tryphon product from back in the day) I use for general cleaning of gunk off of barrels, just to get it to a point where I can polish it.  Toothpaste works wonders on hard rubber and plastic, for general cleaning.  4) Most essential skill - Patience.  Be prepared and know when to step away from the bench.  The pen has lasted 40/50/60/70+ years waiting this long, another day, or two, or week won't hurt it.  I occasionally have pens I cannot get open and it takes months to get them open.  I work on them a little each time I repair, then set them down.  When I get frustrated (as sometimes happens in repairing pens), step away.  Learn what time of the day is best for repairing pens.  For me it is mid-morning.  I've woken up, had breakfast and coffee, and my head is clear.  If you're thinking of other things, repairing pens is not what you should be doing.  Some days I can repair for eight hours.  Other days, I'm done after three, and ok with that.  Also, if you don't know the answer to something, how a pen works, how it comes apart, what to do if all the methods still don't work, don't be afraid to ask someone.  Find a mentor who you trust who is willing to work with you.  5) How long?  Years.  Maybe 8-10.  I started by repairing pens I would then offer for sale.  You know the situation, buy an ebay lot of 10 pens, keep two, repair and sell the other eight to cover the cost of the two you wanted. Once you are fairly confident, then, and only then you can offer your services.  It will likely be longer than you think, and probably should be.  It's a completely different experience when someone sends you a Duofold Sr. to repair then if it is yours.  I have worked extensively with Joel Hamilton and Sherrell Tyree, two of the most respected people in the repair business. I had the wonderful opportunity to host them for several days at my house where we talked and practiced repairs at my bench for 10-12 hours a day.  I was already fairly confident in my ability at the time, but looking back, I knew very little.  I still have a long way to go to being in their level of proficiency, but there is always something to learn, always.  Funny story, when Joel sat down at my bench at 8:00 am on the first day of training, we walked through Vacumatic repair.  Something I was already fairly comfortable with.  Joel asked to see how I repair a pen, so I took a grey marbled Junior as the first test subject.  I immediately proceeded to crack the barrel in half taking out the filler (in hindsight, there was likely a crack, but...).  This leads me to my last point.  You WILL break some pens.  Probably a lot at first, but over time it becomes less and less.  You can never be responsible for the condition of a pen someone sends you.  Always inspect the pen before opening a pen up. If there are cracks, fractures, shrinkage or anything else that may lead you to believe it may break, contact the owner first.  They may want it restored at any cost, or may want Grandpa's pen unrestored if there is a possibility it may break.  Treat every pen as though it were your own and always proceed cautiously.  This is not a race, and no medal for being the first one to fix the pen.  When you break a pen it becomes parts.  Save everything as you never know when you may need it.  And lastly, know it is ok to tell someone you would rather not risk breaking their pen than have something happen and have to fix it afterwards. People will respect your honesty."

Feel free to say that you may not be the best person to do a repair if they feel very attached to what you are repairing.   I am a pc tech and if someone tells me their life's work is on this hard drive and they will do anything to get it back then I am going to send them to a specialist company for recovering data. If anyone has a chance then it will be them.   People tend to respect you more for being honest in saying you are not the right person to take their repair to, but in the end some customers can be overly demanding. Just make sure you can meet their expectations before you get in over your head."

fountainpens,3d56ng,BrianAndersonPens,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:03:57 2015 UTC,"Hi Brian;  Thanks again for your excellent advice. One question came up: are the polishes you mention safe on celluloid? I have Flitz polish, which I hear is basically a Simichrone equivalent. Is either polish safe on celluloid (like Vacumatics) or resin (Mont Blancs in my collection)? I am hoping Flitz is so I won't have to buy another one!  I've read through FPN on the subject several times and it seems there's no agreement. Ron Zorn says avoid Flitz or Simichrome for antique pens; others swear by them! What do you think?"
fountainpens,3d56ng,BrianAndersonPens,2,Fri Jul 17 13:19:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know why Ron would say avoid Simichrome.  I will see him in DC and will ask his opinion.  I have used Simichrome and Flitz both on all vintage pens with good results, usually for a final polish after micro-mesh (but not always, sometimes a pen doesn't need mm).  The only reason I don't use Flitz much any more is it is easier for me to get Simichrome.  I could get Flitz at cost at a previous job, so that was convenient.  As always, your mileage may vary, not responsible for blah, blah, blah.  And don't use on hard rubber.  :)"

fountainpens,3d7h4u,Fade_0,4,Tue Jul 14 03:23:36 2015 UTC,VP Mediums run a bit bigger than the regular pilot medium
fountainpens,3d7h4u,nutationsf,2,Tue Jul 14 03:55:58 2015 UTC,This is correct.  It runs about the same as most German medium nibs.  I know that the medium nib on my VP is the same size as the medium on my TWSBI 580.
fountainpens,3d7h4u,SinglesRazor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:26:20 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time trusting those measurements since ime a Pilot M (steel) is just minimally finer than my (steel) Pelikan EF. And I've heard it said from many that Pelikan nibs are wide even amongst German brands.  That being said, my EF Lamy 2000 was just a hair thicker than my gold Pilot fine nibs. So I would expect the medium VP to be similar to the fine L2K, although I've also seen quite a few people comment that Pilot's gold medium nibs tend to run wide for a Japanese medium. With that in mind, the VP might be a little wider than the L2K."

fountainpens,3d35va,nappeunoppa,18,Mon Jul 13 03:48:04 2015 UTC,"Impromptu Review: As a brief background for the uninitiated, Daiso is a Japanese convenience store that can be found in California (or at least that's where I found my local store). The chain sells a variety of goods, including low-priced writing utensils, which we'll be looking at here today. (Disclaimer: This review will most likely not be very objective, as I haven't taken any exact measurements or the like, but I also feel that the majority of reddit FP enthusiasts will be unable to access this particular product, so I am content with this being merely a sharing of my experience.) I came across this pen randomly at my local Daiso store, and being priced under the same $1.50 price tag that commands the bulk of the store's writing utensils, I said ""why not"" and gave it a chance. Knowing full well that this was most likely a rebranded Chinese knockoff pen, I opened the cheap blister pack expecting to have to adjust the nib. What I wasn't expecting was a writing experience that rivaled pens in my collection 40x its price! Construction: The barrel is constructed of a very thin layer of metal (but metal nonetheless) which actually turned out to be very light, approaching in weight of a resin pen. The section features a thin plastic grip, which tapers to a metal flange before unfurling into the nib. Surprisingly, while the plastic section threads that connect the section to the barrel (which has metal threads) has some unsightly flash left over from the molding process, the section itself lacks seam lines, something that even my Parker Sonnet or Waterman Hemisphere couldn't avoid. The cap is also constructed of thin metal, with a plastic inner cap, and features an attractive metal clip that is stiff, but not unusable. The nib is a standard steel ""IRIDIUM POINT [GERMANY]"" nib, which has some light scroll-work and is small (although proportional to the size of the pen). According to the package, it is sized ""Medium,"" although my personal experience with it hints that it is probably an Asian Medium. Overall, the construction is par for a pen of this price point (as compared to other cheap Chinese metal pens) but has a pleasant element to it in the lack of section seam lines (which normally bother me to an irrational amount). The Writing Experience Above all else, the pen blew me away in terms of its adjustment. I initially bought the pen, thinking it would be good practice for nib adjustment, but as soon as the pen hit paper (a measly 3 seconds after I popped in the provided small international cartridge) the ink flowed, and the pen wrote spectacularly! The feedback was minimal, but prominent enough to give me control of the pen (which is how I prefer my pens) and the flow was quite generous; a solid 7/10 in terms of wetness. The pen being lightweight, even though the barrel was made of metal, made it easy on the hand despite the thin section, and posting the cap made little, if any, noticeable difference in balancing. The line thickness, being an Asian Medium, was very agreeable to both my cursive and block writing styles. Another pleasant surprise was the ink itself, which I originally thought would be a terribly performing, no-name ink stuffed into a random small international cartridge. But upon seeing the color and smelling the ink on the nib (don't ask how I know), I'm fairly positive that the ink is either Pilot Blue or Pilot Blue-Black, which are both very respectable cheap inks that I was quite happy to see being used in this cartridge. As a result of the well-behaving ink and the well-adjusted nib, the pen wrote spectacularly on Rhodia paper and admirably on a regular legal pad (not shown in the album). Conclusion: Certainly there are many ways to spend $1.50. In my case, I made a gamble, and I emerged the better for it. I now have a durable, smooth-writing, international-cartridge-compatible pen that I can use for my school work, a position in my collection that was sorely needing remedy. However, I don't discount the fact that I most likely scored a very lucky example that had gone through quality control effectively, and that I could have just as easily bought a lemon. Therefore, I won't preach for Californians to go out of their way to go buy this at their local Daiso store. However, if you do find yourself at the convenience of one such store, and you have some spare change in your pocket, and you have the means of fixing the nib if all goes awry, the pen itself has a surprisingly good body, and could very well serve as essential practice for your nib adjusting skills, or it could function as a great throwaround pen. Either way, there are worse ways to spend $1.50, I would imagine. [Edit: Formatting]"

I don't think you got as lucky as you think; I think these pens are actually better fresh from the blister pack than expected. It wouldn't be unreasonable for others to expect them to write well too, imo :)"

Also, although the nib and feed are friction fit, I wouldn't recommend removing it unless totally necessary, which it was for me (scratchy and little ink flow). The feed's fins are very brittle and I accidentally cracked two of them. Surprisingly though, it didn't affect the flow. After a thorough cleaning and flossing, it writes beautifully and smoothly. A really great pen for new users to work on adjusting and easily replaceable if need be. Im hoping to pick up a few for my office mates to initiate them into the world of FPs."

For example, many of my gold Sheaffer triumph nibs are nails, but the open ones have a little spring to them.  I would put this nib as softer than a Sheaffer, but not as soft as some of the vintage Parker gold nibs.  I haven't purchased many modern gold nibs so I can't compare with those.

Nib and feed further out. Stiffer? Slide them in further.   Noodler's pens in general are leaky sons of bitches. Store them nib up amd you'll be fine.

They aren't the most refined of pens, but they work, which is why they've been making them for years and years and years. I'm not sure if the Ahab and Konrad are completely new tooling or not, but I suspect so.

I actually got a 149 off ebay that was stuck, since it's precious plastic you can soak it in water so i left it inside a bottle of water for a day and thankfully that was all it took."

I'm not that great with detecting subtleties in color though, so I may be off in that assessment.   I do love the ink though, and plan on getting a bottle.

It wasn't expensive at all, and for the price, I'm quite satisfied with what I got. The threads on the section stick a little bit, but not too much, and there are some minor imperfections in the acrylic.  Really, I'm pretty satisfied overall.

I'd recommend an M400 nib. The M2xx nibs are steel or gold plated and will run fro. 25 to 60. The M4xx nibs are gold, off more flex, and tend to be smoother and wetter.

As for ink, it is shipped with loooots of care from Goulet so it never ever breaks, I can't say the same for all other sources and cannot personally attest to wonderpens having not yet tried them. The five weeks it took for you to get it is extremely uncharacteristic and honestly, I blame customs.   On another note, how do you find wonderpens, other than more economical?"

I was looking for some paper and envelopes for a Gift, and he went out of the way, to find a matching set because the site was out of stock.  Everything I've ever heard about Goulet was great, the shipping costs were a little high, especially with the exchange rate being what it is, but oh well, like you said, it was well packed.  It might be customs, as it was there for most of the time, but either way, it was still 5 weeks before i got my order.  WonderPens, I typically have it before the week is out, and at 8$ flat rate shipping.  Sure the price of bottles of ink are slightly higher than the US amount, but it's usually close to what the difference in the exchange rate is, and is much less than the exchange rate + the difference in shipping.  I guess I'll just shop around some more, and see what I feel like.  I was asking mostly because wonder pens didn't stock the de atramentis line of inks."

At this point I'm more looking for daily use pens than starting up a new hobby(there are a lot a parallels to vaping here: the thing you hold, the thing that does the doing, and the liquid, so I imagine spending can get out of control real fast). I'd like something that feels nice in the hand(with just a little heft) and lays in interesting line.   I don't know what my budget will be. I'm willing to spend for quality, but don't see myself picking up a Montblanc 146(about the only fountain pen I had heard of before recently). I might be willing to go up to ~$200 if my research shows it's worth it(for me), but will probably try to stay under.

I may save up for the m600 in red for the next few months so I can afford it by Christmastime for myself or before if I get to sell some other of my pens worth more value.   I'm also going to get an xf/f on it as I want these pens to be daily writers and then maybe I'll start getting replacement nibs to swap with

It's one of my favorite inks in my collection, except it seems the Lamy Turquoise is almost the same color and cheaper. :(   I have had a slight issue with that Caran running a little dry in my Diplomate F nib though, causes some skipping that Noodler's inks don't seem to."

fountainpens,3d39w6,vermilions,18,Mon Jul 13 06:29:11 2015 UTC,Inks are one of the big reasons I love fountain pens ... I wish I didn't like them so much because flushing pens between inks is a pain - but I rarely ink a pen with the same colour twice.
fountainpens,3d39w6,caseyjarryn,6,Mon Jul 13 04:38:03 2015 UTC,I'm like you in the sense that I enjoy how fountain pens feel when I write. Although the reason I find inks appealing is that I write quite often (student) and looking forward to trying new inks helps keep me motivated and looking forward to classes. This may just be my case but it adds  more excitement to a pretty mundane task.

I'll probably only ever use blue, black, burgundy, and occasionally green and brown in my pens.  I'm not real picky when it comes to the perfect shade of something."
fountainpens,3d39w6,BrianAndersonPens,4,Mon Jul 13 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not into inks because you can't have any in Eastern Europe, so it's easy. I would collect them, like pens, but fairly sure would never used them. Was afraid to ask this here, but what's the point in vivid inks? Oranges, reds, bright greens — what's the application for them?   So I have a couple of Pelikan black bottles and some Chezh ink and that's about it."
fountainpens,3d39w6,trznx,6,Mon Jul 13 09:14:23 2015 UTC,"Red inks are often used to mark corrections, and some colors may be used for highlighting text, rather than writing, per se, but mostly: some people just like other colors. Same reasons as having ballpoints or gel pens in strange or unusual colors.  Black, blue, and blue-black are good and fine for most stuff. Personally, I am fond of using a dark brown, but I've got a green in my current writer."
fountainpens,3d39w6,Canthros,2,Mon Jul 13 14:55:17 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I like bright colors.

fountainpens,3d39w6,trznx,2,Mon Jul 13 15:12:37 2015 UTC,"What I mean is: there's really no mystery to solve, here. Excepting some specific uses (corrections, highlighting), most people using inks that aren't blue or black are using them because they happen to like the color. It's really as simple as that: not all choices are about physical functionalism.  Personally, I take at least a half-page of notes any given day at the office, just keeping track of what I've been working on, or putting down things for later reference.  99% of it, nobody will ever look at, ever again, but it helps me remember things, and being able to remember that I did actual work is good for my state of mind. It doesn't any of it have to be in any particular color, so it's just in whatever I felt like loading up, last. Like I said: this week, it's green. Next week, might be purple. Or red. Or black."

I'm a big fan of vivid inks (oranges and purples especially). They add a some fun and personality to my day-to-day writing (like personal notes) and let me throw a little fun into the world when writing thank you cards or signing receipts.   Which isn't to say that I'm not also a big fan of more staid inks (I just inked up my Sheaffer 100 with some extremely professional -- but also extremely gorgeous -- Diamine Blue Back): they also add some personality to my writing; just a different personality. I would probably think twice about signing mortgage documents with Blaze Orange but wouldn't hesitate to do so with some of my more boring inks...but they will still light up the page in a way that ""Bic Round Stic Medium Black"" just can't do.   So yeah. It's not so much about the utility for me: it's about having fun even in the most mundane tasks (and refusing to entirely grow up because that would be boring)."

fountainpens,3d517m,mousiechika,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:18:02 2015 UTC,The Prera grip is thicker than the Safari grip.  But you can pick up the Safari right away and write without adjusting your grip.  I found my Prera F to be finer than my Safari EF but that's left to the luck of the draw for you.
fountainpens,3d517m,ijoju,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:41:11 2015 UTC,"I don't recommend eyedroppering the Prera. I eyedroppered my Penmanship (same nib/similar feed) and it resulted in inconsistent ink flow (perhaps responding to hand temperature?) It actually burped ink while an art director was using my pen, giving him a bad impression of an otherwise nice little pen. So I went back to using the CON-50. Also, I had to do some manual adjustment of my Penmanship EF to get it flowing well (slight cleaning/adjusting the fins on the feed) but once I did I just fell in love with it.  I love my Safari EF, too. It's a little wider than the Penmanship EF.  But I liked the Penmanship enough that I just ordered a Lime Green Prera F today!  Good luck. Just don't eyedropper it... I went back and forth twice and had bad results both times with weird burping/too-much-flow eyedropper issues."
fountainpens,3d517m,JunkyardSam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:11:44 2015 UTC,"Also, you may know this but the Prera is a smaller pen than the Lamy. Every review I've read said they use the Prera posted even though they usually prefer unposted pens, just because the pen is shorter than normal. (If that's an issue for you. Both pens snap on/off, and people say the snap-on of the Prera is particularly nice.)  I use my Safari unposted. I happen to like the Safari grip (and I'm left handed!) although the grip is unpleasant when I use the pen upside down for fine lines. That said, this Lamy EF nib writes as well upside down as it does normally, so it's nice to flip over for two different line widths!"
fountainpens,3d517m,JunkyardSam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:14:32 2015 UTC,"Personally, I found the Lamy EF line width to be about 0.4mm while the Pilot Metropolitan's M nib (same nib as the Prera) was much thicker. The Lamy EF was more comparable to a Pilot F."

fountainpens,3d2veu,MalakElohim,5,Mon Jul 13 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"So, I absolutely hated the IPG nib that came with it. Eventually I got sick of having a pen I'd turned be so horrible to use. I had an Edison nib laying around from a birthday present I'd received, so I slid it in, I needed to carve and sand down the nib unit plastic to fit inside the section. This also allowed the nib to fit inside the cap properly.  I also grabbed a rotring converter for it to replace the cartridges that it came with.  The wood is Merbau.   Overall, this is now a fantastic writer, although the section itself is too small for my personal preference for long writing sessions. I like it quite a bit, but it'll probably be my only wooden pen."

fountainpens,3d6q24,abraxart,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:08:38 2015 UTC,Why do you think I'm upset about this?
fountainpens,3d6q24,ElencherMind,5,Tue Jul 14 16:35:10 2015 UTC,They only made 930 of the Carbongrafite version and 930 of the Nanotech version. These are very obviously limited editions. Also that retractable nib mechanism is easily going to cost more and we are talking Visconti here and they don't do things cheaply.  If they made various swirled acrylic versions and added them to their standard production lines to make them somewhat more affordable. I would probably make it my grail pen but at their current price they just aren't worth it.  Also as far as I am aware the Visconti Pininfarina has at no point in its history been more affordable than the homosapians but then again I don't really keep upto date on Visconti prices.
fountainpens,3d6q24,SuperShyChild,5,Mon Jul 13 23:46:16 2015 UTC,Even if you compared the lowest street price of the Pininfarina against the full MSRP of the Homo Sapiens it would still be twice as much. I have no idea why OP even asked the question.
fountainpens,3d6q24,ElencherMind,2,Tue Jul 14 00:46:13 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but the Pininfarina offers a pretty substandard retractable pen. Visconti's usual QC problems apply and the mechanism isn't terribly novel. Buying a Homo Sapiens and a Pilot VP limited seems like a better use of money."

fountainpens,3d0wnu,overrule,2,Sun Jul 12 18:44:50 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, you can get the nib units for 60 dollars or so. I initially had a medium on my VP, but got a fine unit as well. Worth it in my opinion."
fountainpens,3d0wnu,anothercatforyou,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:42:17 2015 UTC,"At that cost for the nib unit, it's a pretty good argument to buy another Vanishing Point.  That, or get the nib unit, try both, and resell the one you don't like."
fountainpens,3d0wnu,mooninitespwnj00,2,Mon Jul 13 06:19:43 2015 UTC,"The Limited Editions are actually fairly expensive — another nib would definitely be preferable to buying a whole new VP. I think I may get myself an EF, since my writing is fairly minuscule and I value precision. I think I'll keep my medium nib around though, as it has nice line variation and would be a bit more fun to play with. An EF would be a workhorse nib for me. :)"
fountainpens,3d0wnu,celticchrys,2,Mon Jul 13 16:02:42 2015 UTC,"Good points, though of course on the other hand, MOAR PENS!   Seriously though, if the VP was significantly more than just another 70 ish dollars, you're definitely right about getting another nib unit, especially if it's going to be the only writing utensil you use.   Usually for me, the cut-off at getting a new pen instead of a new nib is when the nib (unit) is > 50% of the cost of a new pen.  That's why I have 3 Lamy Safari's (F, EF,  1.1 stub) instead of 1 Lamy Safari with three nibs."
fountainpens,3d0wnu,stavros79,2,Mon Jul 13 17:01:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely makes sense! Sadly the Limited Edition is damned expensive — generally goes for $200 from what I've seen — or else I'd probably have, like, 3 of these. 😊  I do also plan on eventually acquiring a metal Namiki Falcon with Spencarian nib customization, (Grail pen #2!), and that will be my ""fun"" pen. For this pen, I wanted a high-quality every-day-use kind of instrument, and the VP + EF nib will be especially perfect for that. :)"

Those are the three colors of 18kt gold nibs that they carry, and you can select whichever one you want.

Either way, it contrasts really well with the paper which makes it really readable. I love this particular shade of maroon, so I don't have a problem with getting sick of the colour.

Each time you use it you can think of your Grandpa and how much he thought of you.   I have had many pens, including Parker Vacs, restored by Danny Fudge of The Write Pen. He is knowledgable, quick, and reasonable, and he respects your pen. I would include a note, or maybe tell the story when you email him first, to give him an idea of the importance and provenance of the pen. The 51 is robust, and a common restore, so I am certain you'll be pleased.  I offer both condolences and well-wishes for a pen companion for many years to come."

He gave me a pen, knowing that i liked fountain pens, and told me he wants me to sign my diploma with it. Sorry for the sad story, just need some help ID'ing this pen.  I believe that the pen is a Parker 51 Vacumatic in Navy Grey, but I am not an expert in vintage pens. I would love to have the pen restored, after which I will place it in a display case until I graduate. I would like /r/fountianpens to recommend me someone to restore this pen.

Every time the same ink is in a new pen, I test it on the same page (so one ink per page with different pens). The notebook is not in any sort of order - I just flip through it when trying to decide on a color."
fountainpens,3d2zfo,DiamineRose,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:01:52 2015 UTC,"I have a 3-ring binder (which is getting full; will need a larger one soon!) with two sections: the first has a grid-and-line pattern printed on 32lb HP paper, divided by color (red, pink, orange, yellow, etc). I use a glass dip pen to do a small swatch and name for each ink.  The second section is the actual review section, organized by color (RGB, etc again) then brand name, then ink name. I made a template (similar to inkjournal.com's) -- also on 32lb HP laser paper -- with dry times, ratings (for feathering, lubrication, flow, shading, etc), price per mL, a space for doodles and swabs, etc. Each ink gets its own page.  I took a few photos of the two sections Saturday night as I was recording new inks, actually: photos here.  ~60 inks recorded so far and it seems to be working well for me. I'm thinking about adding a section of small squares of other papers (cheap loose-leaf, copy paper, Rhodia, etc) for each ink, but need to figure out how that'd work/be organize-able."

fountainpens,3d0g2b,Martinsimonnet,5,Sun Jul 12 13:31:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for this!  Somebody on the Fountain Pen Network site compared the Lamy 2000's looks to an overgrown Parker 45. I like their semi-hooded designs and the curved torpedo shapes. :)
fountainpens,3d0g2b,lesserweevils,2,Sun Jul 12 15:55:06 2015 UTC,That's a very accurate comparison haha.
fountainpens,3d0g2b,NotClever,4,Sun Jul 12 18:33:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting comment on the ink window. I see your point in that you don't get a clear ink view, but I think it's perfectly functional. The way it works in my experience is if there is ink in the window it basically appears opaque, but if there is no ink you can see some translucency, even without holding it up to light. It may bit tell you exactly how close you are to empty, but it's a solid warning that you're pretty close to done when you see translucency in the window."
fountainpens,3d0g2b,ExcaliburZSH,5,Sun Jul 12 18:22:18 2015 UTC,"I think the main problem I have with the ink window is how thin it is. Compared to, say, a Pelikan's ink window, which is much larger and gives you a better estimate of how much ink is left. The L2K's ink window gives simple information: ""You are out of ink"". The Pelikans' (for example) give you a bit more: ""This is how much ink you have left."""
fountainpens,3d0g2b,duffydavid,6,Sun Jul 12 18:48:10 2015 UTC,"It is less of an ink window and more of a warning light, it's you see it, you need more ink."

fountainpens,3d0g2b,trylliana,9,Sun Jul 12 14:23:21 2015 UTC,"I'd say this is the largest issue in FPs today - the lack of consistency. It doesn't seem to matter a whole lot which company or price point - the chance is not insignificant that it won't write particularly well. How many people have tried their first fountain pen, only to get a bum nib and assume that's the way it's supposed to be? Perhaps this would be too costly, but I don't know why some computer assistance isn't used to QC nibs before they leave the factory."
fountainpens,3d0g2b,ironhelixx,7,Sun Jul 12 16:30:18 2015 UTC,I think for something as expensive as the Lamy 2K it's completely unacceptable for duds to reach the consumer.
fountainpens,3d0g2b,Ogroat,2,Mon Jul 13 01:20:59 2015 UTC,"Indeed. My first Lamy 2k was an EF, and it was terrible out of the box.  Had it been my first pen I would have been really put off by it.  I was able to get it aligned and smoothed out with some work, and now it writes fine (although with a narrow ""sweet spot"".)  A new FP user would not be able to do that, usually - and with the price tag you should not have to work on it right out of the gate like that.  I also have a 2k<M> and a Stainless 2k<B>, and both of those were smooth out of the box."
fountainpens,3d0g2b,FiveCentPrincess,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:37:06 2015 UTC,You'll get no argument from me on that point. It's telling that vendors flourish who test and adjust each pen before mailing it to the buyer - it says that a very significant portion of new pens need work out of the box.

fountainpens,3d0g2b,stavros79,3,Sun Jul 12 15:25:42 2015 UTC,Could be inconsistent nib quality. I ordered a Lamy 2000 from Amazon but it had a scratchy nib so I returned it. Then I got one from Goulet and asked if they could test it first. That one was a lot better.

fountainpens,3d0g2b,jordanjay29,3,Sun Jul 12 16:08:33 2015 UTC,I have had both and my Lamy was much less smooth than my Pilot. Perhaps our writing angles and pressures favour one nib over the other. (Or of course it could've been one off-nib)

The ink window is indeed quite useless compared to its older 27/30 brother ink window for example. I love the feel of the material (that's what it mainly does for me I guess) of the pen a lot. It's just different to my other pens and it's 'grippy'.   edit: Typing text with too much caffeine is a really bad idea --> words

fountainpens,3d0g2b,NotClever,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:38:00 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend trying the xf nib, characteristically different and where in my experience this pen truly shines.  I have little patience for most Lamy pens (your Al-Stars, Safaris etc). However, the QC issues people repeatedly highlight are often the result of a break in period necessary with pens that are not worked on by a nibmeister prior to release. This is the reason you find a smoother pen to begin with Pilot, Pelikan or Sailor. However the incremental improvement following is offset by most gold-nib and iridium tipped pens that have been well broken-in.   TL;DR: Try the xf L2K, it is something exceptional. Quit crying about QC and write with your pens."
fountainpens,3d0g2b,irrenhouse,9,Sun Jul 12 15:59:10 2015 UTC,"Fountain pen nibs with modern tipping don't ""break in"" unless you're writing on sandpaper. What people call breaking in a pen is them flushing gunk out of the feed, or getting used to its quirks, after using them for a while. No amount of writing is going to fix a misaligned tine or scratchy/baby bottom tipping."
fountainpens,3d0g2b,Its_Probably_Me,2,Sun Jul 12 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there are other possibilities during the ""break in"" period.  For instance, if somebody finds a pen slightly dry, they may unconsciously press harder. Over the next few days, maybe the pen becomes wetter and more to the user's liking as the tines stay spread (that is, if they don't spring the nib first).  There could be other factors as well. Maybe a slight tine misalignment works better for one particular user's grip angle. If this person is heavy-handed, they may bend the tines out of alignment so that the pen feels scratchy to everyone else. I dunno, I'm just speculating."

I like Rhodia and Clairfontaine, the latter mainly because they do a French ruled notebook which I grew up using... I write two lines to a ""square"" so they end up being very economical and I write about 800-850 words to each A4 page.  As far as a pen, I only own one somewhat high end pen, a Pilot Vanishing Point. I use a fine nib and it has carried me smoothly through several thousand words this past couple weeks. I have the gold nib and it writes great but depending on your grip you might hate it. I might just go ahead and buy the Decimo just because it's slimmer and lighter.  Someone else can probably give you better recommendations and I'm sort of a noob tbh but I do use my fps mainly for writing fiction, and I write for long stretches of time so...  I have also used moleskine notebooks pretty extensively in the past but they really don't flatter fps and you will lose a lot of ink characteristics by using them.  TLDR; get better paper to write on, I like the Vanishing Point but if you have little hands like me you might think about getting the Decimo instead."

I have all of the following and would highly recommend each of them. They are all extremely comfortable in the hand for very long writing sessions.

I've spent quite a bit of time looking for the ""perfect"" capless pen with the right girth, length and weight so that it just feels great in the hand (no discomfort due to threads either) and looks great to some degree as well, as I'm very much a user not a specimen collector.   take a look at the ones I recommended definitely try them out in person if possible. I made a number of errors assuming how pens felt and now have quite a collection of pens that I just never use because they don't feel comfortable (of which I find kind of annoying).   Good luck!"
fountainpens,3d0t81,mhornberger,2,Sun Jul 12 20:43:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about the snap cap thing. Doesn't comfort depend on where the threads are and where a person holds the pen? The thread location varies from brand to brand and even from model to model. Where the pen is held varies from person to person. I'm not convinced that it's fair to say a snap cap would definitely be more comfortable.  With my entry-level pens and mid-range models (under $100 to $200 or so), some have snap caps. None of my higher-end ($300 or so and higher) pens have snap caps — my nice ones all have screw caps."

As others have mentioned, you will have to give some thought to both paper and ink, as well as pen.

For a pen I have two reccomendations, first is the Pilot MR in medium which is available on Amazon for £13 and take international cartridges and some international converters (not pelikan converters unfortunately). Secondly is the Lamy 2000 which is definitely a work horse pen. Their QC occasionally have issue but at £110 from Amazon you can send it to be adjusted by John sorowka for well under budget. They are reasonably easy to find to train in stores as well.  Ink samples are available affordably on eBay as well.

fountainpens,3d0t81,lesserweevils,2,Sun Jul 12 19:06:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely try to get into a store to try out some pens. Probably western Fine or Japanese medium nibs would be a good size of you are taking notes in A6 sized notebooks. I prefer Medium if I am using A5 or larger generally.   John sorowka is in Oxford and a very good option if you want a high end pen adjusted to work just write for you and is very helpful. For more expensive pens I would suggest either buying in store so you can test a couple to find the particular Lamy 2000 (or other pen) that works for you. Otherwise it is worth factoring in the cost of adjustment (~£25 plus shipping both ways den ending on the exact amount of work) if you buy online.  Also look at the Fountain Pen Revolution website, they are cheap pens that are tested before shipping. This removes almost all the QC issues, mine was a nice writer but wasn't as luxurious as other pens. Excellent work horse pens though."
fountainpens,3d0t81,shikitohno,2,Sun Jul 12 20:57:49 2015 UTC,I am doing something similar - hand writing in a leuchturrm master notebook - and highly recommend the pilot custom 823 for the job.
fountainpens,3d0t81,abraxart,2,Sun Jul 12 21:22:32 2015 UTC,"I can share some good news about Moleskines. They're a longtime favorite of mine, and I had loads of them ready to use (bought in bulk) when I started using fountain pens. I did wind up giving half of them away, but I still like them -- and you can find pen/ink combos that work with them.  As you consider pens, think fine or extra fine nibs. If it's just a matter of utility and you're not that interested in line variation, an extra fine is all you need.  My workhorses for Moleskines, then, are my Franklin-Christoph model 20 Marietta with EF nib and my Pilot Custom Heritage 912 with a Waverly nib. These both write nice and fine and fairly dry, which means very little feathering and bleedthrough with almost any ink. You can get Waverly nibs with other Pilots too -- one with a piston filler, like the CH 92, will hold more ink and get you further with your volume of writing. I got my Pilot 912 through the Japanese site Engeika, which carries the full range of Pilot nibs.  The FC Marietta I mentioned is a slip-cap, which means less time unscrewing, and it can be used as an eyedropper -- basically you use the body of the pen as the reservoir. FC offers a number of nibs by Mike Masuyama, including a needlepoint nib that writes really damn fine.  Others may be able to recommend inks that resist feathering. There's Noodler's x-feather, though I've never tried it.  So all that's for if you want to stick with Moleskine. I've wished over and over their paper was as good as everything else with them. Leuchtturm1917 books are pretty nice, you can get them cheap at Kikkerland's frequent sales, plus they're numbered and have table of contents pages. And you can get A4-sized books that might be good for your volume.  Lately though my favorite notebooks are Clairefontaine. I get A4 softcovers. The paper works with any nib, any ink. Which lets me use my other workhorses -- other FCs, a few Sailors, a Lamy 2000 (recommended), and the Kaweco AL-Star, which is small but built for rough travel.   And in the last few months I've picked up a few Indian ebonite eyedropper pens. These tend to be inexpensive, durable, and high-capacity writers. I have some from Kim & Company sold by ""krishnapens"" on eBay. I love them -- not the best lookers, some of them, but built for work. And they know how to set up a nib.  I'm a writer myself, and sometimes the lovely ink, and the line variation and shading you get from a stub or cursive italic nib, actually helps the writing along. If I'm blocked, I can get a jump start just watching the ink happen.  And look at me ramble."

fountainpens,3d0t81,clstearns,2,Mon Jul 13 15:08:02 2015 UTC,I sugest you visit a B&M pen store and try different pens in hand.
fountainpens,3d0t81,misslovcat,2,Sun Jul 12 22:01:19 2015 UTC,"Personally I have 2 pens that I feel I can write a LOT with.    The Pilot Decimo (or if you prefer slightly larger, the Vanishing Point). The convenience, build quality, and overall usability are great with this pen. Writing for hours is not a problem (depending on your grip though the clip may annoy you). Cartridges have a larger capacity than its Con50 converter but those are more convenient for a quick reload anyway. Proprietary carts though. The Edison Nouveau Premiere. This pen is amazing with a gold F nib. Well made, easy to refill with either intl. standard carts or bottled ink, super easy to disassemble and clean, simple construction also means easy to flush without a full disassemble. These can also be converted to an eye-dropper for a very large ink capacity; reducing the need to stop and refill."
fountainpens,3d0t81,hwknd,2,Sun Jul 12 22:11:10 2015 UTC,"Don't buy from American suppliers as suggested. You will pay what you save in import duties and then there's always the post office 8 quid ransom fee - err I mean handling fee and they'll keep it for days in customs. Either use a UK supplier - cult pens are very fast but not the cheapest - or try this. Go to Mr Pen (Google it) and buy a parsons essential. Probably a medium nib. It will cost you less than 60 quid and will give you a starting point. Then having decided you want another pen in addition to this you'll have time to read about it a bit and choose what suits you. If you decide it's Japanese then buy via a Japanese seller on Amazon. And don't be too surprised to see the customs form describes your pen as a toy or stationery and gives a very low value. Which means you avoid the import duty (and ransom fee). Pure pens is another good supplier by the way in the UK - they do Pelikan pens a tiny bit cheaper than Cult but have smaller stock. Look at pen reviews - SBRE Brown ones are exceptionally useful, as are The Pen Habit, both on You Tube. I would not recommend the cheaper Lamy pens unless you try them first - the triangular section is a love or hate thing but they are available at WH Smiths so easy to try them. The standard reply for a 1st pen by our US chums is the Pilot Metropolitan - but is is not such a cheap option here and the step from section to barrel some find to be uncomfortable.  For notebooks look for the cheaper UK based suppliers. And bear in mind anything imported from Japan will take up to a month to arrive but it is a lot cheaper. Cult Pens are okay as are Bureau Direct.  Inks - well Diamine are in Liverpool so forget Noodlers and go with them. But while you use up your Moleskine books use the short international cheap cartridges (WH Smith ones) and they'll not bleed through badly if at all.  Hope at least some of this helps. WH Smiths sell Parker, Cross and Lamy's and their own makes (dunno if they are any good). And the lower end will not break the bank until you decide what is best for you."
fountainpens,3d0t81,l_iollan,2,Sun Jul 12 22:14:01 2015 UTC,"Many inexpensive ""beginner"" pens can be workhorses. My Pilot Metropolitan, Lamy Logo (identical nib and innards to a Lamy Safari) and even my $2 pen have never clogged, though the cap on that $2 pen may eventually wear out. If you take care of your pens they shouldn't clog.  Anyway, I'll echo the other people here and suggest trying several inexpensive pens first. What you like will be very subjective. You'll have to choose between long pens and short pens, heavy pens and light pens, thick/slender/moulded grips of various materials (some people find metal slippery), snap caps and screw caps, various line thicknesses that are not consistent between brands, different filling systems that vary in convenience and capacity, etc. It may be better to know what you like (or dislike) before committing to something more expensive.  Also, expensive doesn't necessarily mean you'll enjoy the pen more. I've read a review where somebody claimed to like a $15 pen more than a $300+ MontBlanc. Others say that past ~£100-£130/~$150-$200 USD you aren't getting better performance, just fancier body materials. Finally, a cheaper pen tuned by a professional nibmeister can outperform a poorly-adjusted nib on a much costlier pen.  In short: Buy a pen that has characteristics you like. Don't buy a pen just because it's expensive."
fountainpens,3d0t81,l_iollan,2,Sun Jul 12 22:20:22 2015 UTC,"One thing to watch for with Pelikans is the trade offs between vintage and modern nibs.  QC on modern nibs is generally hit or miss, though you can just send it back and get things fixed.  Many people at the fountain pen network would say that the older Pelikans nibs were better quality, and you can pick up a variety of old Pelikans for that budget.  However, they may need a little bit of care to clean up before you start using them, like flushing any residual ink from the piston and possibly soaking the nib unit overnight if the pen wasn't stored clean.  This is pretty easy though, and par for the course with any vintage fountain pen, not just Pelikans.  The biggest reason I'd recommend a Pelikan is for the massive ink capacity of their piston filling mechanism.  At the rate you write, you may have to refill the convertor on a Parker 51 or other convertor pen 2 or 3 times, depending on the choice of nib, ink and paper.  A Pelikan will likely need to be filled only once every other day or so, by my guess and all other things being equal."
fountainpens,3d0t81,franchoetc,2,Mon Jul 13 00:43:17 2015 UTC,Everyone bitches about Moleskine but it depends on the size nib you like. I personally use a Japanese EF nib and it works just fine on a Moleskine. I also have used a TWSBI F nib and that works as well. Anything bigger and it will feather though.   As far as the pen Honestly I would go with a Vanishing Point. The converters will carry less ink but you could use a cartridge and just syringe refill when its empty.
fountainpens,3d0t81,aliceinconverse,2,Mon Jul 13 00:58:49 2015 UTC,"Consider the following combination: Pelikan 200/205 (100$) TWSBI 580 (55$) TWSBI Diamond Inkwell (30$) Pelikan 4001 1 Litre (80$)  Total cost is 270$ or so, before buying composition books.  Rationale: First, you have TWO pens, so that you can rotate between the two (you'll end up liking one over the other, but chances are that you'll use both daily) and significantly cuts down on the possibility of pen troubles. Both are piston pens, so you'll be carrying around a lot of ink. TWSBI has a notorious problem with cracking, but the reasoning will come. Inkwell may seem like a frivolous purchase, until you realize that you are going to be consuming quite a lot of ink. What happens at the end of a bottle (You will be using about 2 ml a day, so a standard 2 ounce bottle will last you a month)? Getting the inkwell, you will be able to get all the ink out of the bottle. TWSBI has a good inkwell, so that influences the TWSBI pen purchase -- the Diamond inkwell has an attachment to fill the TWSBI pen without getting ink on the section of the pen. So if the TWSBI runs out on you, it's much faster to refill it without having to grab a tissue. Granted, it will break on you, but you can get replacement parts for free... and you have another pen.  Composition books: Yes, they will feather and ghost or bleed. But they're cheap bound notebooks and work well enough, especially if you are going to transcribe into a computer."
fountainpens,3d0t81,insidioustact,2,Mon Jul 13 03:15:23 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at a Parker 51, I'd look more toward the Vacumatic end of the spectrum. They hold a whopping 2.5mL of ink.   I, too, am an author. Generally speaking, I write 500-1500 words per day. For my daily carry, I have a modern Pelikan M805 with Sailor Sei-boku ink (which is my primary), a 1947 Parker 51 Vacumatic with either a black or burgundy ink (which is my beater), and a Platinum Preppy highlighter in eyedropper mode with Noodler's Dragon Catfish Pink ink. This gives me two different colors of ink (one for draft and one for corrections, swap daily) and a highlighter for marking the manuscript. All three have huge ink capacities, though the Pelikan is the smallest at ~1.5 mL (which is still a substantial amount of ink). These go in a Nock Co. Lookout 3-pen sleeve.   I keep a Tomoe River Seven Seas Standard from Nanami Paper with me as a journal, and carry a Clairfontaine classic clothbound notebook for each manuscript I'm working on. Really, the binding for these CF books doesn't matter; all their paper is friggin excellent."
fountainpens,3d0t81,aliceinconverse,2,Mon Jul 13 03:41:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this! I was wondering as well, but I mostly do 2-5 pages of notes a day and I'm growing out of my Pilot Prera and I wanted a bit of an upgrade.  Could you possible update when you make your choice? :D"
fountainpens,3d0t81,NotClever,2,Mon Jul 13 04:00:40 2015 UTC,"Another thing to consider could be ink capacity.  I personally actually like having to refill a pen ( makes me feel productive for having written enough to empty it), but if you write where you don't have instant access to ink you probable want a pen with a larger ink capacity.   TWSBI and Pelikan come to mind. I like TWSBI better since I grip pretty low and that works out better with a TWSBI.   If you want to stick to Moleskin until you've used up tge notebooks you have, definitely go with F or EF nibs. Dryer finer nibs usually actually work well even on Moleskin paper.   If you haven't written with fountain pens before I'd try a 50-100 pen first, and I'd definitely try to go to  store to try a few different brand and see what fits your hand best.   Leaves enough money to buy black and brown ink, and maybe an extra cheaper pen (pilot metropolitan?) and a brighter/red ink for editing."
fountainpens,3d0t81,aliceinconverse,2,Mon Jul 13 08:27:49 2015 UTC,"working on my own novel as well, and have a similar use case; writing daily in longhand for hours (already have a few pens I use regularly, so I may be able to help).  a few questions: left-handed or right-handed? underwriter or overwriter? is your paper rotated? how big/small is your writing? Or rather, what is the thickness of the line laid down would you prefer? (the uniball you use, 0.5mm or 0.8mm? for reference, before I got my fountain pens, I used to use 0.4mm Pilot Hi-tec C pens, and stopped using them because they aren't nice to hold)"

I use the fat .8mm Uniballs which deliver a nice wet line of about .6mm - that would be ideal in a FP.   Any advice appreciated.  (and good luck with the novel btw)"
fountainpens,3d0t81,Liessae,2,Mon Jul 13 14:55:58 2015 UTC,"For that kind of line, you'd want either a western fine to medium (varies from manufacturer to manufacturer), or a Japanese medium nib. For a quick reference, check this link out http://nibs.com/TippingSizespage.htm  for the long periods of writing, you'd want something comfortable, but pen sizes, weight and ergonomics can be rather personal; best to try them out in person if possible.   You'd find that past a certain price point (you have a very good budget), most pens are very decent writers, and the differences mainly lie in other aspects such as the ink filling method and capacity. You can't really go wrong with most of the pens already recommended; ie. Lamy2000, Pelikans etc.  I'm a lefty underwriter who rotates the paper around 20 degrees clockwise, so its pretty similar; with those requirements, you'd be able to use most fountain pens without issue, so you have a lot of choices. The pick of the field, really.   Without a baseline of what you might or might not like -  ie. is the pen too light or too slim for your hands? - getting a expensive first pen doesn't seem like a good idea imo. I've used a few cheaper pens like the Lamy Safari, Pilot Metropolitan, TWSBIs - and while they all do work fine, they all have their flaws.  I would probably recommend that you take a look at the Pilot custom 74/91 (same pen internally except for aesthetics) with a medium nib to serve as a baseline for comparison. In terms of ergonomics they're about the same as any cigar shaped pen on the market; well-balanced, average sized, takes the con-70 convertor (one of the largest, if not the largest cartridge convertor on the market). And they'll cost about 100usd shipped if you buy direct from Japan.   The stiff nibs will be similar to most other nibs on the market, but there are options for soft nibs for these pens as well. It's a pleasantly springy feel as you write. Since the nibs are soft, the tines part slightly with a little pressure, and can make a nice wet line; if you go with the soft nib option, I'd recommend the soft-fine-medium due to the tine spread. (While I personally really enjoy them, and use one for my everyday writing, not everyone would enjoy them. I like the soft nibs because it reminds me to write with a lighter hand, which is much more comfortable over the long run).  For inks, pretty much anything will work since you don't have a smudging problem. for sheer volume and overall decent performance, check out the 350 ml bottle of Pilot Blue-Black. Costs less than 20usd shipped (you'd need a small empty bottle to decant into for filling though)."

I've done my research on similar parameters as yours, here's my experience.   Despite de Decimo and VP being amazing pens I wouldn't recommend them unless you're willing to go the cartridge route. Both of the converters that fit have poor capacity, and I'd hate to refill and refill. If you go cartridges it's just pop it in and go, also holds more ink.   The Lamy 2000 is my workhorse pen but I wouldn't recommend it as your first pen, hooded nib and narrow sweetspot could be a problem, so if you get it at least try it first.   The M200/M400 Pelikan are incredible pens, you could even get the 200 and fit an M400 nib but,  they're reliable, hold a ton of ink and sexy. The M200 is my other workhorse.   You could also go with a Platinum 3776 or equivalent prince Sailor, but you won't get the same ink capacity.   Pilot CH92 is an excellent option as well.   Finally, you could get a Safari, Metro or Kaweco Sport and experiment a bit.  I would recommend trying anything in a shop if possible no matter where you buy it.

fountainpens,3d0t81,someincrediblebore,2,Mon Jul 13 14:51:34 2015 UTC,"I'm going to offer some advice with the warning that ymmv. I'd go for a plastic pen or a vintage well restored pen like a sheaffer or ester brook. If you switch to fountain pens you will need to switch notebooks- is this something you are willing to do? As for the pens I suggested, jet pens.com tells me that your unable currently weighs 0.4 ounces. I've heard amazing things about the Lamy 2000 but it weighs 4.2 ounces- that's a huge difference when writing quickly for long periods of time. Meanwhile, a Pilot Custom Heritage in the demonstrator style weighs 0.7 ounces and comes with a 14k gold nib. I'd first suggest ordering several platinum preppies (fine point) and pilot varsities from jet pens (grab some of your favorite uni-balls while you are there and a staple bound rhodia pad. Compare the uni-balls and the fountain pens you purchased on the moleskine and the rhodia pad. Do you like the varsity or preppy better than your old combo? DO you prefer the rhodia pad? This will guide you if want a fine point or a medium point. Then decide to take the next step of an expensive workhorse pen. I'm a student in the humanities who writes many pages every day. I have smaller hands and this does influence my choices slightly  when it comes to weight and size but I find many metal pens are simply too heavy for long-term quick continuous writing. Fountain pens are great for increasing speed to get the information down, but hand fatigue from the weight of the pen can be just as much of a factor as stopping to unclog a section. But once again, this is just my personal opinion."

fountainpens,3d0t81,GitaTcua,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:34:20 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting your weight for the Lamy 2k? According to Goulet, the makrolon version is about 0.9 ounces and the steel version is about 1.9 ounces.  Even with ink added I don't think either if then come out anywhere near 4.2 ounces.  But yeah, weight should be a consideration for sure."

From left to right: Pilot Iroshizuku Kon-peki, Noodler's Liberty's Elysium, Baystate Blue, Diamine Oxblood, Sapphire Blue, and Red Dragon, Noodler's Apache Sunset, Empire Red, Black, and 54th Massachusetts. I think I am set on ink samples for quite sometime but I appreciate any ink suggestions to keep in mind for the future!"

fountainpens,3d1vct,reubenco,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:31:20 2015 UTC,"Damn, really? The Metro already feels a tiny bit too small for my hands. So I should go for the Classic?"
fountainpens,3d1vct,reubenco,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"I haven't used the Classic, for all I know it isn't any better. But the Sheaffer is definitely smaller than the Metro (in general, allowing for variations in experience and posting or not, etcetera). I don't want to bump up your budget (although the price difference isn't too great) but I think the Sheaffer 300 is a little bigger, if you really like the Sheaffer design."
fountainpens,3d1vct,LyndsySimon,2,Mon Jul 13 00:23:23 2015 UTC,"I have a Classic and love it.  I'm not terribly interested in the Sheaffer 100 - and I have about a dozen vintage Sheaffers. It's just not that much of an upgrade from the VFM in my opinion.  Between the two, I'd get the Classic."
fountainpens,3d1vct,gwreck318,2,Mon Jul 13 00:24:38 2015 UTC,"I don't have experience with the classic but I have a Sheaffer 100, and I really love it. It's slim but has good weight and feels well put together, and the nib was incredibly smooth out of box. I'd definitely recommend it"
fountainpens,3d1vct,Its_Probably_Me,2,Mon Jul 13 01:44:07 2015 UTC,If you are upgrading from the Pilot Metro I would seriously suggest saving up for one of Pilots gold nibbed offerings (imported). There are different pens with prices in between the two but not make that are a clear upgrade. If you are looking for different then I think vintage or TWSBI 580 would be good options
fountainpens,3d1vct,Its_Probably_Me,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:21:33 2015 UTC,580's out of stock on Goulet :/ but I'll do some research on some cheaper gold-nibbed pens. Thanks for the suggestion!

I found the nib to be VERY stiff, even compared to my 580s, and quite dry. This is actually perfect for my dad, but not for me! I have a Sheaffer Sagaris, which is absolutely fantastic, but quite slim/short. I believe (thought may be wrong) that the 100 is even thinner."
fountainpens,3d1vct,blackbird17k,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:37:25 2015 UTC,"I have the Sheaffer 100 and the TWSBI 580.  If it's for notes the TWSBI is better simply because you will not ever find yourself out of ink.  I have had it happen twice that I went to a meeting with my Sheaffer and ran out half way through.  Overall, I find both of them comparable, smooth and neither of them are too dry (I find my metro more dry).  The Sheaffer is much easier to clean as it comes apart without any additional tools.  Those are my 5 cents for you!"
fountainpens,3d1vct,ymkv19,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:30:58 2015 UTC,"I would recommend against the classic:  I think TWSBI is phasing them out. I contacted Goulet a while to get a new nib unit for my classic, and they told me that TWSBI had stopped offering them. Perhaps TWSBI is changing the classic so that the nib units for all their pens, are the same? Whatever the reason, it's not encouraging."

fountainpens,3d1xp3,Mishellereine,2,Mon Jul 13 02:19:46 2015 UTC,Maybe a kaweco sport would be more pocket friendly.

Or might look at the al-sport version. I'm not sure if a lamy al-star would work.  The jinhao pens I have are sturdy but do not like being jostled around for they tend to spew ink into the lid. I have a x750 and x450

fountainpens,3d1xp3,chatusripitak,2,Sun Jul 12 22:44:32 2015 UTC,You would use a converter. It is basically a cartridge shaped piston that lets you use bottled ink instead of cartridges. You can use any brand fountain pen ink you want and it is much cheaper in the long run than cartridges.   It is not a frequent mention but I really like the lamy logo. The lamy logo is a full metal body pen including the threading where the grip section and barrel of the pen meet. It is very solid without being bulky or heavy unlike some of the other commonly recommended durable pens. I have it in my jeans pocket and it handles me moving around quite well.
fountainpens,3d1xp3,Holoholokid,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:47:59 2015 UTC,Would mix ink in small batches unless you already made up your custom color and using an ink syringe (basically a 5ml blunt tip needle) you either fill the converter or empty cartridge.    I got mine from goulet pens. http://www.gouletpens.com/gpc-inksyringe/p/GPC-InkSyringe

fountainpens,3d1vjx,Mishellereine,3,Sun Jul 12 21:59:41 2015 UTC,Agreed. Stone paper is great for ball point or rollerballs but is abrasive on FP nibs.  The paper itself is waterproof and it doesn't absorb the FP ink like cellulose based paper making waterproof inks non waterproof
