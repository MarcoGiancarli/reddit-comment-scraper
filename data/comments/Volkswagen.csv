Also, I was in the beginner group and a lot of these guys probably didn't know what they were doing, but hey, I'll take what I can get! I'm running a stock non-PP Autobahn DSG with the stock all season Pirelli's, btw."
Volkswagen,3e3o2z,shelves,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:02 2015 UTC,I recently changed my compressor on my Golf 6 2010. It was about 450 E in a VW service. I also had to replace other parts. Total cost... about 700E

Volkswagen,3dzxu9,catchthefish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:01:30 2015 UTC,I've put quite a lot of money into this car recently. Most recently a transmission swap. Running like a top now so selling it is more selfish for me wanting something newer more than anything. I've got it for sale but if I have no takers I'm fine holding onto it for a while longer. Love this thing.
Volkswagen,3dzxu9,gasfarmer,2,Tue Jul 21 01:50:13 2015 UTC,Transmission swap on a MK4 Autotragic?  How uncommon! ;)
Volkswagen,3dzxu9,sharpfork,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:17:26 2015 UTC,"I’ve had this wonderful car since I started driving. It’s been in our family since 2006 when it passed down to me from my mom. After getting me through high school and college, it’s time to move on. Before I let it go, I wanted to share with y’all two of my projects I did to it throughout the years.  The glass headlight lenses kept me from buffing that plastic every year. Really brightens up the front end (and the road at night). I also took care of my sagging headliner last summer with a plaid makeover. I’m glad I did it but would never do it again. Keeping the pattern straight and the sheer amount of work from start to finish was quite the project. I’m no master upholsterer.  I’m going to miss this car so much but I’m not leaving the family. On the lookout for a MKVI GTI."
Volkswagen,3dzxu9,sharpfork,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:50 2015 UTC,I have a 2001 and am curious about the glass headlight kits.  How long did it take you to put them in? Are (were) you happy with the results?

Volkswagen,3e039t,funkspiel56,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:41:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on the key. Most new cars are set up with a key that is programed to the car itself, for this reason most of the time you have they have to be at the car to program the key and the car to match each other so the car will start.  Lots of times you can call a locksmith to come out and program the key but with many new VW's they have a laser cut key as well, like my MKV, which most locksmiths will not be able to make for you. The dealer should be able to order a key for your vin number of your car then you will still need it programed.  TL:DR - Losing a key to a modern car sucks and is expensive"

The VR6 is a well-regarded engine, someone else may be able to speak to its particular weaknesses (there aren't many that I know of). However, the Mk4 generation is NOT highly regarded as a paragon of reliability in general. Failed accessories, check engine lights, and electrical gremlins are the sorts of things I'm talking about. You might do a bit better with a later Mk4, but only so much."
Volkswagen,3dz3ko,WagenMafia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:56 2015 UTC,More reliable than my current car. Okay thanks for the advice. I'll try to find something else

If I were you, I'd test drive the new MK7 as well and see which feels better on the road.  P.S. Dynaudio is supersweet. Worth it, no regrets. Also, '16 will probably get iPhone/Android integration"

I mean, you know, if you don't want it... I'm in the market for a MKVI GTI. Xenons are number one on my list. I've been looking for a month now. That's a great price. Also it's worth noting the MKVI is the last GTI to be made in Germany. The MKVIIs are Mexican built. No sure if it makes any difference to you but it's a nice cool factor thing for me. The power bump in the MKVII is probably nice. I haven't driven a VI or VII but I think you'll be happy either way. Have fun car shopping."
