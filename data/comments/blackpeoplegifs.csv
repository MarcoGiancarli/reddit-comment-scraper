blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,_adidias11_,57,Wed Jul 8 13:28:29 2015 UTC,Woah wait I need answers. Was it called a strike? Some sort of baulk? I don't remember ever seeing this.
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,Dingobabies,87,Wed Jul 8 15:45:39 2015 UTC,It's a strike since there was no runners on thus no one to deceive as the batter knew the ball was going to him.
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,TheAutumnSoldier,29,Wed Jul 8 15:47:33 2015 UTC,It would still be a baulk though. If there's no runners on the pitch just wouldn't count. But the ump didn't call a baulk so the pitch was legal.
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,dr_girth,41,Wed Jul 8 16:27:17 2015 UTC,"Why would it be a balk? It's a continuous motion. Bizarre, but not even close to a balk"
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,AhoyPaloy,22,Wed Jul 8 17:17:19 2015 UTC,He would have to do that shimmee every time for that to not be a balk.
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,dr_girth,40,Wed Jul 8 18:41:13 2015 UTC,"Out of the stretch yeah. But with the windup, key point being no one on base, there's a whole lot more freedom with what a pitcher can do with his motion"
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,YawnDogg,6,Wed Jul 8 19:01:04 2015 UTC,So pitchers that intentionally speed up their wind up are balking every time bc their delivery is changing when they change their wind up speed no?
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,uprightbaseball,2,Wed Jul 8 19:38:19 2015 UTC,nope. pitcher's quick pitch batters all the time without being called for a balk.

blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,popeycandysticks,2,Thu Jul 9 00:32:48 2015 UTC,"I believe that a balk is defined by the legs. You can wind up to throw the ball any way you want, but when you start to plant your front leg and stop or change direction, it becomes a balk.  But i'm not a rule book, this is just what I heard."
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,dr_girth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:47:27 2015 UTC,"It's more than legs. There are lots of things that define what could be a balk, and there is definitely a lot of grey area. Out of the windup, pretty much the only way a balk would be called is if you start your motion and then stop, or do something extreme to ""decieve"" the hitter. Which I have no idea what defines that exactly. Out of the stretch a balk could be the same start and stop, or if a pitcher comes set then moves his shoulders, if he steps off the rubber incorrectly, stuff like that. Way more than just legs, but they are a big part of mechanics, so they do play a role"
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,popeycandysticks,2,Thu Jul 9 13:23:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I'd call this a balk then for sure, unless it's his actual pitching motion... but im sure batters would complain"
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,dr_girth,0,Thu Jul 9 19:33:26 2015 UTC,"He usually does the twist. The shoulder shimmy is new. But again, with the windup there's more liberty, which is why it wasn't called. I don't know the exact rules, but I really don't think this is a balk"
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,the_sammyd,7,Thu Jul 9 20:22:02 2015 UTC,"No such thing as a balk with no one on base, it would just be a no pitch and start over, but however this is nowhere close to a balk"
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,TheAutumnSoldier,-6,Wed Jul 8 17:54:12 2015 UTC,"You're right that this is not a balk. But one can still balk without runners on. It's pretty rare, cause what's the point really if there's no runners to deceive? But an illegal motion on the mound that results in a dead ball would still be classified a balk."
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,the_sammyd,5,Wed Jul 8 19:06:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly that's why you can't balk with no one on base, the definition of a balk is to deceive the runner before the bitch, if there is no runner there is no balk"
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,spenoburger,2,Wed Jul 8 20:40:18 2015 UTC,"Bitches man, they'll get ya"
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,datums,7,Thu Jul 9 06:28:55 2015 UTC,"No, the rules explicitly state that a runner on base is a necessary condition for a balk."
blackpeoplegifs,3cjrdj,14jon14,2,Wed Jul 8 21:04:19 2015 UTC,He throws slightly differently nearly every time to throw off the timing of the hitter. He's one of the best pitchers in baseball. One doesn't directly cause the other buy the shimmy certainly is an effective wrinkle in his game. And it's not a balk because his foot is constantly going more toward home plate. He's smart.

blackpeoplegifs,3c839b,gwtkof,0,Mon Jul 6 11:47:07 2015 UTC,It's really pretty unlikely that you'd be listening to music and come up to someone dancing to the exact beat of your song. It's not just that songs exist with the same time.
blackpeoplegifs,3c839b,Soggy_Pronoun,9,Mon Jul 6 13:22:46 2015 UTC,"Unlikely, not impossible."

blackpeoplegifs,3c839b,Ashken,5,Mon Jul 6 15:31:55 2015 UTC,I think you're thinking about it too hard. Most songs are in 4/4. It's really likely that could happen
blackpeoplegifs,3c839b,gwtkof,0,Mon Jul 6 14:19:16 2015 UTC,the important part is the bpm not the time signature

Sure in Andalusia there are some folks who clearly have some moorish heritage but as a whole Spanish people are, in fact, white. I don't really know how you consider a Spaniard calling themselves white is ridiculous when it is, in fact, the case.

blackpeoplegifs,3az16p,OceanRacoon,8,Thu Jun 25 05:04:33 2015 UTC,"White does not mean anglo saxon. At all. Mediterreanian people are considered white, which is why people who live in south/central amercia that have 100% european ancestry might consider themselves white, because they do not posses any native blood. When you say that they don't look english, it doesn't mean they aren't white. Slavic people are pretty easy to spot, and they don't look english, but you would consider them white, wouldn't you? Also so you can get and idea of what the Basque look like, here is a picture of xabi alonso, a famous Basque soccer player. He is a prime example of how nationality and race are completely different.  http://im.rediff.com/sports/2014/aug/27alonso.jpg  I don't know how much time you've spent in the country of Spain, but I've spent a bunch and the people are white.

A good friend of mine was born in Spain and grew up there until his early 20s and said the majority of Catalonians were assholes to him because he didn't speak Catalan, and said they wouldn't speak regular spanish to him.

There is a much more complicated history, especially in recent times, than that of the French Canadians and it in't as simple as the Catalan people seeing themselves as superior. Just look at Spain's economy. Catalonia is almost the only thing keeping it afloat, and it makes perfect sense that they might not feel to warmly about the central Spanish government.

However, I'm speaking from the point of view of someone who tries to make life easier for people if I can, not more difficult for personal reasons.  I'm not fluent in Spanish, but I know a good bit, and if I'm talking to someone who speaks Spanish as their first language, I will try to speak to them in Spanish, even if they know some English.  I just think a lot of people and cultures are full of shit sometimes.

blackpeoplegifs,3az16p,hatervision,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:07:36 2015 UTC,"And Mexicans consider their Spanish to be the clearest and most proper. Even within Mexico there are different accents ranging from Norteño (northern Mexico), Ranchero (Jalisco, Michoacan, Guanajuato), Chilango (Mexico City and surrounding areas), Costeño (Veracruz, Tampico), and Yucateco (Campeche, Yucatan, QR). So when I hear a Mexican say that South American spanish is just a few steps from falling into the category of ""dirty"" Caribbean Spanish, I laugh because even within Mexico there is a hierarchy of which Mexican accent is the best. Generally, Mexicans consider Caribbean spanish as black people Spanish, so they think their dialect is due to their lack of education and other stereotypes of inferiority."

He went to a Jack In Box that looked more like a jail than a restaurant for lunch. On his way out, he's stopped by a bum looking white guy.   Bum Looking White Guy: ""Hey, do you have any money?""  African Guy: ""Are you hungry? I can go inside and get you a jumbo jack and fries.""  BLWG: ""No, I just want the money.""  AG: ""Oh I can't do that. If you're hungry, I'll buy you whatever you want to eat, but I won't give you any money. Do you want to eat something?""  BLWG: ""Fuck you nigger.""  When my co-worker told me the story I was shocked. He says to me, ""can you believe that? Can you believe what he called me?"" I said, ""what an asshole that guy was. I can't believe, even after you offered him food, he'd call you the n-word."" My co-worker cut me off and says ""yeah, I can't believe he called me a nigger either. I'm not black. I'm not a nigger.

I've also had patients that have had good results with seeing chiros and avoiding surgical methods.    Most of the chiropractic circlejerk stems from both uneducated people and people who have seen old school chiros who love putting people on the lifetime weekly program.  The newer guys tend to have a much different philosophy of short term treatment and injury prevention.  Even aside from this, most insurance reimburses chiropractic visits despite how stingy private insurance in the US can be.    If you have some legitimate, peer reviewed, and scientifically backed evidence that it's all smoke and mirrors I'd love to see it.  Anecdotal evidence doesn't count."

There is evidence that spinal manipulation therapy is effective for some kinds of low back pain. It is no more effective than other treatments for low back pain, but is a viable option for patients who prefer it.   https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/science-and-chiropractic/  It's just a more expensive, more time consuming way of TEMPORARILY fixing someones back. It's not that it doesn't work, it's that it is largely pointless and just a way to take money from dumb people."

You sent me a blog post.  That's pretty much the opposite of scientifically backed/peer reviewed work.  No physician I know would alter his or her treatment methods based upon what someone types up online without having done any long-term studies with irrefutable evidence.  Hell, your article even links to a workup showing what chiros actually can successfully do (and your author agrees).    I agree; most of what Palmer claimed is total bullshit and he was mostly a quack.  Subluxation of the vertebrae in an attempt to cure every illness is obviously not realistic and no chiro I know would make a claim like that.  However, many of their treatments actually do improve quality of life, even in the long term.  Good ones are more akin to a physical therapist and many even share a building with one."

Do you think the media would immediately start speculating about the black guy's mental health even though it was very obvious it was a hate crime? If he was a black guy this would've been reported as domestic terrorism."
blackpeoplegifs,3a8vve,mrrohto,4,Fri Jun 19 15:29:01 2015 UTC,"Haven't they been showing this guy with his pro-apartheid patches and talking about it as a hate crime? That's clearly terrorism.   As far as being arrested in the same manner,  I agree with you. A black guy would have had the shit beat out of him at best."

Chances are they would've shot the guy and be praised as heroes, but only after they shot the wrong guy."
blackpeoplegifs,3a8vve,Typhron,2,Sat Jun 20 13:51:05 2015 UTC,"Shit, LA (the city) isn't even ""southern"" so to speak and that bullshit happens all the time here. There's a lot of good cops out there, but there's almost as many shitty ones. And they never get punished."
blackpeoplegifs,3a8vve,nocbl2,3,Fri Jun 26 22:47:23 2015 UTC,"DC is a different kettle of fish. It's on the cusp of Virginia and Maryland, essentially the border of the Civil War and all those holdouts of History), on top of having it's own culture that seems to be more like another nation (specifically, Canada) with lots of progressiveness and forward thinking individuals as well as many ass backwards people people. It's a giant, if a bit odd, hodge podge.  So me being south was just my own stupidity. What can you do?"

blackpeoplegifs,3a8vve,chief_savage,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:38:38 2015 UTC,"It's always the narrative the media try to portray with these kinds of terrorists.

blackpeoplegifs,3a8vve,Typhron,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:53:52 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying but it seems totally possible to me that they would keep popping up with there being 350 million people in just our country. With all the sick junk on the internet, bad parents, and an isolated life, I can see this junk happening semi-often with our modern population size. Every media outlet definitely has their own agenda with everything they broadcast, though. They get to choose where the eyes and ears of the nation are at all times. One of the nice things about the internet is that people without some of those motivations can share what's happening in other places."
blackpeoplegifs,3a8vve,chief_savage,46,Sun Jun 21 08:00:08 2015 UTC,"Would love to hear the commentary about the SC black church shooting by a white guy though.. I wonder if the words ""terrorist"" will pop up..   Maybe they'll just deflect to ""mentally ill""... Seems to be the default.."
blackpeoplegifs,3a8vve,dl7,29,Thu Jun 18 06:36:06 2015 UTC,"That is terrorism, race motivated or not. Even if the guy is mentally ill it would still be terrorism. It doesn't have to be linked to ISIS or the Taliban to strike terror in a community. You hear about stuff like that from pastors but it's hard to imagine it in the US. That junk is terrible; I hope people in the community are strengthened in their faith during this time instead of giving into fear. Idk if you should any ""defense"" of this guy is bc of race, though. Pretty harsh to assume the white community will stand behind some guy that shot up a church just bc he happens to be white."
blackpeoplegifs,3a8vve,chief_savage,9,Thu Jun 18 08:43:44 2015 UTC,I often consider the KKK a terrorist group especially when discussing their historical context.
blackpeoplegifs,3a8vve,Blanco_tipo,9,Thu Jun 18 20:42:34 2015 UTC,"They definitely are. They FBI has a whole list of ""domestic terrorist"" groups that they're monitoring, I assume they're on it. That's why the irs got in trouble for unfairly monitoring tea party groups, it was suspected they might be funneling money to right wing domestic terrorists"
blackpeoplegifs,3a8vve,intothelist,3,Thu Jun 18 21:08:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, they definitely are a terror group. They tried to use fear to keep black Americans from voting or gaining their equal rights. Although the KKK is not the only racially motivated group in US to have practiced voter intimidation as the Black Panther Party has also used it as a tactic in recent elections. I don't keep racist company so sometimes I forget how bad some people actually hate other people for such asinine reasons. I've read about churches where the ""pastor"" will just shout extremely racist rhetoric and even talk about killing people of whatever race. Idk how they keep a congregation if their scripture is supposed to be the Bible, obviously no one there cares what's in the book."

In my opinion, if you commit a crime and you are of sound mind then you deserve to be locked up; if you commit a crime and cannot control yourself then you need to be locked up bc you are not safe. Either way, if you're commiting crimes you should be locked up."

It hurts to hear about these hate crimes. I know there are more that happen that we don't hear about. I know I will never fully understand what it is like to be a black person in America. I can't.

At its basis, terrorism is defined as an act carried out specifically to terrorize a group of people. In this man's case, he selected a group and terrorized them. The problem at play here is that the word ""terrorist"" isn't associated with white people because the term ""mentally ill"" comes first.   If a Muslim walked into any church and opened fire, we'd be talking about another attack on our soil and how the Muslim faith should answer for their ""terrorist"" ways. Same with a black guy going in a white church. He'd be labeled a thug and all the people with the BlackLivesMatter movement would have to speak up.  But with this guy, they'll play him up as if he really is mentally ill and white population is given an out for this behavior. This nation needs to come to terms with the double standard it has set forth concerning whites vs any person of color.  I'll hop off my soapbox now"
blackpeoplegifs,3a8vve,dl7,2,Fri Jun 19 03:58:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm well aware of the double standard, and it's really stupid. I guess I've always associated terrorism with groups, not individuals. No matter what, though, this guy's an asshole."

They needed to release a game to keep the X-men license (as they were making lots of Marvel games at the time) and quite literally had some left over Marvel sprites from previous fighting games. They literally got some of their programmers to throw that mess together and called it a day before shoving it out the door.  And then X-men vs Street Fighter was an overnight hit and many an arcade machine was ordered worldwide. And so subsequent releases expanded said craziness in earnest, encompassing the whole marvel and capcom universes with MvC. And then MvC2 became the penultimate version for awhile that Japanese people actually didn't like (it gives them motion sickness).  Fightin' games are fun, tho. Go look how to play one and stick with it for awhile. It's a great way to meet people."

blackpeoplegifs,3a26pi,sap91,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"At this point the very notion of ""E-sports"" is 15 years old and diverges greatly depending on their origins based on country (Majorly being North America in it's entirety, Korea, Japan, Europe, and Northern South America). Different origins with different minds and different communities and drama and the like. All of them survived (and are surviving) through the years due to a large sense of community between players and upholding many traditions that have kept infrastructure alive.  With that in mind there was always intermingling and mutual respect between other e-sports for the games they made competitive (except Smash), but this was done through people flying to other countries and dabbling or hearing news of what was happening to each scene through hearsay. When every one of these communities were able to do so online things sort of meshed into a huge almgamation. At the same time we also saw a lot of smaller things getting bigger hype around them (events like EVO) AND the legitimization of other games being considered E-sports as huge sporting events (LoL, Dota/2), etc, and the rest is history.  /r/Kappa is the result of that giant history and how everyone who is into E-sports comes together for something. In the case of that picture, silliness and in-jokes that can really be explained away as ""E-sports!"" (keeping in mind that the word ""Kappa"" has it's own origin due to Twitch, but has it's importance in E-sports due it's usage for sarcasm and lack of seriousness).  And therefore, E S P O R T S."
blackpeoplegifs,3a26pi,Typhron,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:33:20 2015 UTC,What's wrong with Smash?
blackpeoplegifs,3a26pi,sap91,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:31:15 2015 UTC,"Was (and partially still is).  Smash bros, particularly in the 2000's, only had Melee and 64 under their belts, and wasn't popular as a competitive game as it was a really competent party game. And that's fine and all, with the understanding that said fighting game being an actual fighting game would take years of iteration and maturity as well as a way of playing said competive modes in larger venues (much of the reason why characters/movesets you need to unlock are banned is that on arcade machines there's no save function and unlocking such takes awhile, especially with odd rules). Nevermind that Smash's 'dominance' was only in one area where these competitive scenes grew up (that is to say, North America exclusively).  That was lost on the Smash community at the time, and somewhat today as they fail to realize what those old players did wrong.  Smash players were disruptive and disrespectful toward other fighting games (claiming that theirs was the best despite playing nothing like one), didn't understand why breaking the game to make it competitive was seen as difficult to deal with (the aforementioned ""unlocking stuff"" reason), and often gave community organizers hard time (Pissed off the EVO staff, who legendarily have 0 tolerance policies, tried to split the community by making separate forums and sites for other fights that also catered to Smash because people called Smash players on their immature crap on sights like SRK and Dustloop), nevermind not working with devs to make their game better. Eventually they all just fucked off and nobody batted an eye.  It should be worth mentioning that Smash is relevant today, but only after a lot of other E-Sports groundwork was laid. After Dota/2 and LoL, and LONG after other fighting games and RTS's like Starcraft made their marks on the world. The community and games have changed and are far more mature, but for the most part no particular person misses the old Smash player mentality that would end in physical fights at venues between two players."

blackpeoplegifs,39x1ie,Counter423,8,Mon Jun 15 15:45:11 2015 UTC,Why would it implode or explode? He was never going to win this series. He doesn't have nearly enough talent around him.

I am a really devout NBA watcher and occasionally I throw on one of my pins or my lanyard at work, and have to hear the most ignorant shit.   ""oh you're a Bulls fan. I bet you only liked them cause of Jordan"". No, actually, Pippen is my favourite player of all time.   ""The Cavs have been the best team for years!""  Best one I have ever heard was after Game 2, someone wearing a Cavs LeBron shirt that Delleavdova is a top 5 PG cause he locked down the MVP."

blackpeoplegifs,39x1ie,RedditardLogic,7,Mon Jun 15 20:46:24 2015 UTC,"He's also having to do basicly everything for the cavs since they are down two strong players. It's not really fair to look at everything he's doing and say ""he's bad because he can't finish"""
blackpeoplegifs,39x1ie,esplin9566,-4,Mon Jun 15 21:57:16 2015 UTC,"Finishing is the hardest part of any sport. Anyone can put up crazy stats during the first 38 minutes when there's no pressure. Just ask Russell Westbrook. What matters in the finals is how you finish your games. I'll take Ray Allen hitting a clutch 3 in the final seconds any day over Allen Iverson putting up 33 in the first 38 minutes. What would you say if people proclaimed Michael Phelps as the greatest swimmer of all time if he never finished his races strong and only had a couple of gold metals from a relay race he swam in the middle of...? Would you care that ""yeah but Phelps broke 100 records in the first turn, push off, 10 seconds, etc.?"" No, you'd call him a loser and that'd be that. What would people think of Adrian Peterson if he couldn't run a yard once his team got inside the 10? Enough excuses. What was lebron excuses for going 2-2 in the finals with the Heat? Not enough talent? Were the dinosaur spurs or makeshift Mavs just such unstoppable forces? Let's not forget he was 1 spur free throw away from losing to the Spurs the year before... Either you know how to win or you don't and Lebron simply doesn't know how to win. He can't finish. He can't even own up when he loses"
blackpeoplegifs,39x1ie,RedditardLogic,3,Mon Jun 15 22:40:15 2015 UTC,"Idk if lebrons issue is not being able to finish, so much as it is the face that hes playing 46 minutes a game. I dont disagree with you, but i think he's  eatned a bit of a pass on this one."
blackpeoplegifs,39x1ie,rockph3nom21,3,Tue Jun 16 00:35:33 2015 UTC,Yeah it's so easy to put up those stats that you named another superstar that is capable of it. It's so easy that he's the first person to avg 35/10/5 in the finals. It's so easy he's broke several finals records. And he does it double teamed almost every play. There is absolutely no way to pin this loss on LeBron but the haters find a way. If it's all LeBron's fault then I guess it was all MJ's fault the Bulls didn't make it out the first round till Pippen came.
blackpeoplegifs,39x1ie,chief_savage,2,Tue Jun 16 09:35:33 2015 UTC,"Bulls didn't make it out of the first round till pipin? 1st of all the east was WAY better back then, there's absolutely no debating that fact. 2nd, besides Lebron first finals against the Spurs he's had to assemble an all star roster to get to the finals each season. He had Irving until the finals, he didn't get there on his own. You out kobe in his prime in the same situation and he's doing the exact same thing, except he's actually hitting shots at the end of games."
blackpeoplegifs,39x1ie,RedditardLogic,2,Tue Jun 16 13:36:15 2015 UTC,"Kobe ain't hitting shots at any point of the game any more lol Sides that, LeBron has shot a much higher percentage in the last two minutes and OT than Kobe. All them expansion teams back when MJ played and the legends getting old but yeah they were better than this year's east. The Pacers, when healthy, were a heckuva team."

Who said we had to change their views? Since when was that the goal? The point isn't to change them, its to allow decent people to enjoy the site.   The subs kept them all in their little corner out of everyone's way, if you didn't like their sub and their content you didn't see it.   That is the popular theory, but it simply isn't true. Mods in poplar subs outside the Chimpire have complained openly about being invaded by Chimpire subscribers who use clean subs and fill it up with their filth. These people aren't content to be isolated, they infect everything and /r/all shows that the defaults are rife with misogyny, racism and fat-shaming. That's not an accident, I've been on Reddit a long time and I've seen the change.   Also they weren't ""anti-social"", opinions that you don't agree with doesn't = anti-social.   They cheered videos of black men being murdered in gruesome ways. That's not an opinion; its a call for more violence against blacks.   They're banning ideas, based on ideologies, not behavior.   Oh bullshit! Stop making this about those subs being victims; they know damn  well how they are received. They aren't victims and this isn't some ideology war; its about being a decent human being who doesn't thrive on the suffering of those who are simply different."

blackpeoplegifs,39gay7,JohnRosen,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"The subs existing doesn't stop people enjoying the site...   Because you weren't one of their targets. They bled out of their chimpire and FPH subs and indeed submitted content to other subs trying to spread their message. Stop acting like somehow a person being horrible just segregates that behavior to one place and doesn't act in it elsewhere. They indeed spread that thinking to other subs.   if you don't like the subs you don't have to see them....   No on is arguing that, stop making a straw man out of this.   You have some cognitive issues, none of what you say is affected by banning the subs or by leaving them be.   Personal attacks have nothing to do with the topic of this conversation.   Just because you've removed the sub doesn't remove the people who do the things that hurt your feefees.   Never said we wanted to get rid of these people entirely, even if that would be amazing, but it reflects poorly on the community having them congregated. There are plenty of place online for them to rebuild their communities. Again, you need to stop arguing ""feelings"" I think its not helping your case. Feelings aren't what's being discussed here. Subs from the Chimpire aren't existing to hurt peoples feelings, they exist to gather like-minded individuals to devalue the live of black men and women. They aren't there ti hurt black peoples feelings, thy are there to make sure that blacks remain treated inferior. And when you demonize a class of people, all sorts of abuses arise and we see tat vividly with the string of fatal shootings against unarmed black youth. Did you really think people just didn't want their feelings hurts? Dude, c'mon!   They're censoring reddit, which is done based on ideology   You seem to ignorant of how censorship works or what it means. As a private company, Reddit can do whatever i likes with the services it provides. It can moderate and indeed remove material it does not agree with. This is not censorship, this is a private company protecting its large user base and itself. Reddit is not under any mandate from the government to protect anyones freedom of expression. Reddit is not some government or a authority which can suppress mine or your freedoms. They are a private company and by using the service they provide, we must abide by the rules they set. Reddit is not your government. We don't get votes and representatives on private companies. Did you get to vote on your internet provider? Do you get to vote on your phone bill? No, because we are dealing with private businesses and that means they can set their own policies and rules. Deal with it.   as like thousands of others keep saying, if they were serious about it being due to behaviour /r/shitredditsays would be gone straight away, and /r/SubredditDrama, but they're not.   ""But teacher, Billy also threw paper! Why doesn't he get kicked out too?"" When has that whine ever worked?   If it was really about racism and misogyny etc. then /r/CoonTown /r/RapingWomen /r/PicsOfDeadKids /r/BeatingCripples etc. would be gone, but they're not.   Who says they aren't on the chopping block? Not like you're concern with those being banned anyways. Wouldn't want to trample on their ideology now would we?   wtf are you on about, I dunno who did that, but if they did that still isn't anti-social, and if they really did that doesn't = a call for more violence against blacks.   Did you read the comments? A site collected the comments made on those subs and indeed the subscribers celebrated and demanded more. Why do you think someone shares that? And then he goes to work and high-fives his black co-worker right? Because when you subscribe to /r/whatniggersdie it totally isn't going to reflect your behavior at all, nope, not one bit. Heck, I bet those guys even voted for Obama. Dude, c'mon!   You're a classic SJW who can't think about what they're talking about, how does that conclusion you jumped to make any sense.   Again, :""feefee"" ""ideology"" ""SJW"" you need to start thinking for yourself and stop repeating what stupid people say. Now, how does this help your side of the discussion? This is throwing your hands up, tossing out a label and smirking. It's not helping your argument.   There is really no point trying to reason with you because you're too far gone.   How does this help your side of the discussion?   You're like people who think the Queen is an alien lizard, or that the world is flat, you have your own little reality.   How do personal insults help your side of the discussion? I haven't accused you of being crazy, I haven't downvoted you nor brigaded your comments, I even took time to respond to each point. And I didn't throw a tantrum."
blackpeoplegifs,39gay7,vereonix,-6,Fri Jun 12 15:48:11 2015 UTC,Community standards are a thing. If we make it a community standard that we don't accept that kind of behavior we can change culture.
blackpeoplegifs,39gay7,thesagaconts,3,Fri Jun 12 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"But Reddit isn't a homogenous group, its thousands of communities, you can't blanket the entire site with one ideology. Everyone isn't subbed to every sub, it doesn't make sense to try and enforce ideals on every community.  I've said ideals, not behaviour, as subreddits are not being banned based on behaviour. This will probably devolve into some Gamergate bullshit style situation, where one side is saying ""its about behaviour"" and the other ""its about ideology"" (with the latter being blind idiots) as right now subreddits have been banned based on ideals of what the mods consider to be ""offensive"" or whatever under the guise of ""behaviour"".  If it was behaviour then /r/shitredditsays should be the first to go, and /r/CoonTown etc. But no, to for proof of them banning based on ideas and not actual actions, /r/fatpeoplehate2 - 10 etc. have been banned as soon as they were created, so how can it be behaviour based if the sub hasn't done anything. Also /r/whalewatching was banned as the mods thought it was a FPH sub, no, its was about watching literal whales.... But they banned it without looking based on ideals that it might be against fat people, not behaviour.  I could go on forever. As others have repeated, if they wanted to have actual hatred spewing subs, then they'd get rid of /r/watchpeopledie /r/RapingWomen /r/SubredditDrama  /r/CoonTown /r/ShitRedditSays  /r/PicsOfDeadKids and so on."

blackpeoplegifs,39gay7,Silverstance,-6,Thu Jun 11 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"This is just wrong.  The evidence is that as soon as new subreddits, replacing FPH started popping up, that they were immediately banned.  They even had different creators/moderators, etc.  How can you ban a subreddit for ""breaking the rules"" before its even had a chance to do so?    Then there's the fact that /r/whalewatching was banned simply because some idiot admin thought it was another FPH-derived sub.  Instead, this was a sub dedicated to actual whale watching and had been around for two years.  I don't imagine that people taking pictures of blue whales and sharing them did a lot of harassing, brigading, etc.  There if you'd ever gone to FPH you'd know that even linking to other parts of reddit was not allowed.  If you go to SRS/SRD though...well, that's a different story.  Lastly:  Who cares if FPH was mean-spirited?  If you don't like the content, don't go there.  If you don't like what a user is saying, use the ""ignore"" feature.    It's absolutely disgraceful."

Speaking from my short experience in blackpeopletwitter, it really is bizarre to see people who are clearly not black start speaking in ebonics when they get in there.  I think to myself, is there joke in there? Most of the time the answer is no, they're just trying to pass themselves off as black. Like seriously man just talk how you normally talk.  It seems like a ridiculous rule unless I'm misunderstanding, what does it mean? You have to speak in ebonics when you get in here? Thats an actual rule?  edit: I assume it means ""dont call people out if you dont think theyre black, be cool""?"
blackpeoplegifs,38uxro,DubTeeDub,27,Sun Jun 7 04:32:34 2015 UTC,It means don't be a dick and call out people for being white that's not the point of the sub. It's meant to be inclusive at least that's how I interpret it.
blackpeoplegifs,38uxro,Work-After,19,Sun Jun 7 04:48:36 2015 UTC,"The rule is in place so that the comments are not all ""as a white person..."" or ""are you even black?""  It does not mean you need to speak in AAVE or anything like that.  You should comment as normal.  I will add that this sub is much different from blackpeopletwitter.  We have a pretty established community that has slowly grown over the last couple of years and our users largely understand and follow the rules well.  I think our community here is great and largely welcoming.  Blackpeopletwitter on the other hand exploded over the course of a month without a clear definition of what is and is not acceptable.  Without that direction and the boom of users from the defaults, r/all, and /r/askreddit it is now at a point were the majority of users are aping AAVE and the community there is pretty terrible.  I say this as a mod of both subs.  I would be happy to answer any questions about either sub you have."

Is it considered racist or just politically incorrect?   I'm not doubting you but as a canadian I was always under the impression that ""Indian"" was a racist term to call First Nations/Aboriginal/Native people (which it is here) but then I visited Arizona where I met people that only identify as ""Indian"" and don't consider it offensive at all."
blackpeoplegifs,38uxro,Vertigo666,2,Sun Jun 7 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"Is it considered racist or just politically incorrect?   Bit of both. In the 90s it was referred to as ebonics, but after backlash from a famous (infamous?) Oakland CA schoolboard resolution to use ebonics in it's classrooms to help students better learn standard English linguists have moved away from the phrase. Nowadays almost all material published by linguists on it will refer to it as AAVE.   I was always under the impression that ""Indian"" was a racist term to call First Nations/Aboriginal/Native people (which it is here) but then I visited Arizona where I met people that only identify as ""Indian"" and don't consider it offensive at all.   It depends on where you go in America. Some native peoples in America hate the term Indian because it's so vague and imprecise. They'll want to be addressed as a member of their particular tribe, or sometimes the generic ""First Nations"" (which is the more common phrase in Canada). I tend to use the generic ""native peoples"" if I'm not referring to a specific tribe/group.   But yeah, Indian by itself isn't generally considered racist in America, even by native peoples who dislike the term."
blackpeoplegifs,38uxro,bens111,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:52:05 2015 UTC,"I will be honest, looking at your comment and doing my own research, I have not been convinced that the term is inappropriate.  What I've seen is the suggestion that the term has become unpopular because Rush Limbaugh used it, but I've also seen that the term was coined by a black professor, used by famous black writers and still used in black magazines. I'll continue to do research on it though, I'm just surprised you're the first person to point it out on this comment."

You can show how many times an idea has been thought, and how that relates to the idea put forth by the art piece. You can psychologically explain bad acting or bad dialogue, knowing what humans act like out in the real world. There are basic ideas of pacing or framing that can be explained without bringing in opinions. Basic ideas of the believability of special effects being accurate to life, and the reasoning behind their style if it's not.   Of course, opinions trump everything, but there's also a reason why almost all critics agree on critically acclaimed pieces, and why nearly all critics agree on their reasoning behind critically panned pieces."

Then depending on the demon you wish to summon based on the 72 demons in the book of Solomon, you offer tribute and say their name three times out loud. After that you make your dealings. Please note that it is best to put a ring of sea salt around you before you summon it..that way it will not harm you during your summoning. To close the gate you must make the pentagram into the 6 star shape and banish the demon with either prayer or incantation. This Charlie Charlie shit isn't real, if you want to summon real demons it's best to understand the seal of Solomon.  By the way if you read the following demonic name below you will summon something if you say the name three times out loud and welcome it to your home, what happens next I cannot gurantee.

blackpeoplegifs,363bx6,Fiend,7,Sat May 16 00:58:35 2015 UTC,"Really? I love the guy's stand-up, and his show is pretty much groundbreaking. For me, and quite a few fans of the show, watching Louie is like watching Tyson dominate opponents: you know you're not going to see someone performing at such a high level in their craft for a very long time. One more reason I love Louis CK is that although Hannibal Buress was on my radar, it wasn't until Louis said that Hannibal was currently the best stand-up comedian out there that I actively sought him out and listened to his work. I think they're the two best stand up comedians right now."
blackpeoplegifs,363bx6,cfj1992,10,Fri May 15 20:48:04 2015 UTC,it could be another case of reddit fucking up my enjoyment of something by repeating it over and over because I do like Hannibal but from what I've heard from Louis CK I hated  maybe I need to check out more stuff

He would seriously be way more likable in my opinion if you didn't try to constantly act like a hard ass. Why can't he just be genuine with himself.A few clips out there we can actually see him laughing and enjoying himself makes him seem like a much more likable person but every time I see one of those clips of him catching a camera on him and instantly changing his attitude just seems like a complete waste of his time.

blackpeoplegifs,35j7ur,readonlyuser,27,Mon May 11 08:01:38 2015 UTC,He just absolutely hates being seen smiling.  It's more akin to branding than self consciousness.  He believes he can't be taken seriously and get the respect he deserves if he's a goofy smiling person.

Prior to its creation, it was tough to find reaction gifs that had black people in them. /r/asianpeoplegifs is essentially the same thing.  While BPG, WPG, and APG all tend towards making fun of their racial stereotypes, WPG is almost entirely that because -- unlike BPG and APG -- gifs of white people are the large majority already on reddit. So, unless the gif is of a white person ""being really white,"" then there's probably a better subreddit for it. And this also means that finding gifs of white people ""being really white"" is made easier by there being a single subreddit to find them in."

blackpeoplegifs,345i6t,poopyfarts,24,Tue Apr 28 16:33:05 2015 UTC,There's a big difference between beating your kids and whooping your kids. Most people who weren't whooped don't or can't understand that difference. Everything isn't as one-dimensional as you think.
blackpeoplegifs,345i6t,capnqrunch,-6,Tue Apr 28 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"It still teaches the kid that they can get people to do what they want them to do through scaring them and being physically aggressive.    Numbers don't lie my dude. Any sort of physical violence at all usually skyrockets your kid's chances of ending up in jail. Studies have shown over and over again that it doesn't work. In fact, ""scared straight"" actually increased incarceration rates in those who participated than those who did not.    Not everyone responds to punishment the same way. All of dudes who grew up on my block were physically disciplined all the time. They were also very hood, grew up to be Gang bangers, and almost all of them ended up dead or in jail.      Shit carries onto the playground, and onto the streets, and into life when she gets real. Parents get locked up, and more brothers and sisters get funneled into the system, resulting in more poverty, and continuuing the downward spiral. Reddit loves getting a REVENGE BONER off seeing shit like this but it's that same mentality that encourages violence in the black community.       Go ahead and keep defending these practices and keep watching our children get kicked out of schools and thrown into jails. We don't live in the kind of society anymore that accepts that shit and we need to stop beating our kids, the same way the cops beat us, the same way our slavemasters dehumanized us.      Too bad we get more excited about seeing black kids get beat that we do seeing opportunities and rolemodels for black youth."
blackpeoplegifs,345i6t,poopyfarts,12,Tue Apr 28 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"Well said, poopyfarts. However what you're describing is behavior based on your external environment, not your parents' choice of disciplinary actions."
blackpeoplegifs,345i6t,capnqrunch,-6,Tue Apr 28 20:16:28 2015 UTC,"Actually it's very directly based on parent's method of discipline. The statistics are there: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/17/outlawing-spanking_n_3606886.html https://suite.io/jeremy-suizo/31ds22s http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/07/spanking-and-crime-rates http://www.medpagetoday.com/Pediatrics/Parenting/33561    But let's ignore years of psychological research because it's what momma did! Let everyone beat their kids as much as they want! I'm sure we can put our confidence in every poor, stressed, struggling, broken black family and expect perfect application and design with physical punishment!"
blackpeoplegifs,345i6t,poopyfarts,-6,Tue Apr 28 23:38:27 2015 UTC,Pretty much a whooping and a beating are damn similar. A spanking for a clear violation of a clear rule is one thing. Getting hit because your parents are steamed at you for doing something childlike and vaguely annoying does NOT teach anything worthwhile except that authority can be wieled by caprice with no consequences.

Yes, you should do your best to teach your kids to respect authority in a reasonable way but sometimes your kids will test you and you cannot falter.

blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,thebigbadwuff,84,Tue Apr 28 04:13:32 2015 UTC,"It's not the fighting with fire argument at all. Look. Our culture is obsessed with the Revolution, right? One of the strongest political parties in America is dominated by an obsession over it, to point of naming itself after a key protest, the Tea Party. But the Revolution was a hotbed of rioting and downright deplorable violence. British sympathizers were systematically shunned, innocent civilians were assaulted and robbed, and I'm sure you recall the old stories of soldiers being tarred and feathered- essentially, burned, disfigured, and humiliated. Yet, when we talk about that kind of violence, we talk about context. We talk about history. We say that despite that ugliness, that our history began as a protest against disenfranchisement and manipulation, and that our revolution was not defined by these incidents.  But when Black people go through these same patterns in our protest against systemic injustice, we receive no similar consideration in the public sphere, particularly on Reddit. These people aren't struggling, often unjustly in their methods, against an unjust system. They are not a just uprising, marred by vicious outliers. They're thugs. They're animals. They're 'proof' of why Black culture itself is responsible for the injustice acknowledged by even the President of the United States, and why Baltimore deserves to burn. If I had a nickel for every comment not only wishing death on these people for stealing twinkies, but the protestors tangentially associated, I'd be rich enough to start my own mod-monetization scheme. So that's why I hate the comments about the riots. Because sure, riots suck. But there's riots on a regular basis in the NFL, the NBA, and the world's futbol leagues, and somehow those are comedy segments. ""Distraught"" fans, opportunists, and fools. Somehow they exist in a world of context, and we don't."

It's all finger pointing and blame-assigning.  So thank you all for that.  I do have a comment of my own:  No one cares about a CVS being burned, for sure.  But violence against people is not ok.  Assaulting a random police officer or woman on the street isn't going to get you anywhere but in jail.  And  many of these comments, esp the ones that refer to large-scale societal change only being achievable by destruction (which I don't disagree with) seem to imply some sort of deliberateness or forethought that I don't see in some of the behavior depicted in the media.  I guess it's crazy to think that violence can still be controlled and direct-able once it's started."

blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,dale_glass,3,Tue Apr 28 17:20:51 2015 UTC,"I have no dog in this fight, but there is a difference between your historical reference and the riots.  The Tea Party (original one), attacking British sympathizers, etc, fundamentally makes sense. I'm not talking about the morality of it. Even if the morality of it is dubious (not necessarily in all cases), somebody finding a way to hurt their aggressor is overall an understandable thing.  Burning your own city down however isn't that. When people burn down some random establishment that has nothing to do with their situation, that doesn't cause any kind of understanding or sympathy. Nor does it cause fear in the right parties. Violence can get things done, but it has to be applied to the right target. If people don't even know who the right target is and burn whatever is nearest, that is a sure sign of huge problems that are going to stay. Because the first step in solving a problem is determining what it is, and the very second is determining what action can be taken to start fixing it. If those basic things can't be properly figured out, no amount of violence is going to make anything better.  The guy who punches the guy his wife is cheating with? I don't condone that, but I can understand it. The guy who in the same situation throws his TV out of the window? He's just stupid."

blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,thebigbadwuff,4,Thu May 7 23:30:34 2015 UTC,"I very much doubt every person accused of aiding and abetting the British was actually associated with the occupying forces. You can see similar patterns in the French Revolution, too. When the disenfranchised rise up, they turn on their peers as well as patricians. Violence becomes itself a form of rebellion, an end and a means. It doesn't make sense. When I think of these sorts of things I think of the concept of basic trust.. Babies learn at a very age based on their parents' behavior whether they live in a safe environment. When they don't, it leads to a fundamental and lifelong distrust of the world around them.   I think adults experience this in our relationship with the law. When it is impressed upon you, again and again, that your relationship with the law is ultimately random, and subject to the actions and decisions of other people, you come to believe your choices don't matter. And if your choices don't matter, you're free to do whatever you want. Which leaves to a self-destructive cycle of crime and punishment. Things get shittier, so you get desperate, so things get even shittier, so you get even more desperate and irrational. The only solution is enfranchisement, but there's never been agreement how that actually shakes out. Universal sufferage is pretty new concept- we only started even trying for it in the 20's, and really only getting there in terms of legal practice in the 60's. Same goes for all of the rest of the world. Nobody has the answers yet to gerrymandering and voter suppression. Participatory democracy is younger than quantum physics."
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,George1108,-4,Thu May 7 23:56:16 2015 UTC,"The problem is, much like the London riots a few years back (similar situation, no?), there are a significant number of people taking advantage of the riots and destroying innocents peoples businesses and life's work (and mugging/attacking innocent people) - that is mindless and uncoordinated rioting that more often than not will accomplish nothing.   If there was an organised protest/riot aimed at government buildings, then I'd probably have more sympathy for the rioters and even be in their favour."
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,thebigbadwuff,39,Tue Apr 28 06:53:57 2015 UTC,"But there was! That's what's so fucking frustrating.

It's heads, we ignore you, and tails, ""I'd have more sympathy if they used their words."" They were! We did! We are. But that doesn't fit the confirmation bias people want. It doesn't give people license to ignore protest that challenges their opinions. It doesn't leave room for rank generalization. It doesn't let stormfront and their legions have Christmas in April."

Peaceful protests amount to fuck all in today's society - but militant protests must be aimed towards government buildings as opposed to mindless looting.   Edit: I understand by nature that a riot is uncontrollable which is what we have witnessed, so no one group/organisation/race can be blamed for the recklessness. I'm just saying if there was less of the mindlessness and a more coherent approach (which again, is particularly difficult) then more would have been achieved."

No, he was just the one the government was willing to work with because everyone else was willing to burn the fucking country down, and without that ever present threat from everyone else MLK would of have had zero success.  Violence is frowned upon but honestly without it you will never get anywhere. Literally no drastic societal changes have ever happened without some amount of destruction or violence.   In America we care more about property than we do people.  You can literally be getting killed in the street but ""hey just don't break anything okay""  This is why occupy wall street failed.  The 1% just waited you out until you went home because they knew you cared, but you didn't care enough to put your life on the line for what you were protesting about. If you don't show the powers that be that you aren't willing to die and burn the entire country down with you, they won't budge on jack shit.  That's just real.    The only reason they want you to protest peacefully is because then its easy to ignore you.  If you're in their faces breaking shit it's much harder to ignore them.  I wish things like this could be done peacefully, but they can't, and there're really not any precedent to show that they can.  The people who don't take your cause seriously because you're causing property damage wouldn't take you seriously if you weren't, so they're a non factor.  It's not about the money, its about sending a message.  If the cops know that every time they sprinkle some crack on a black dude that there's a high probability that their city will burn to the ground, you know what?  They might stop sprinkling crack on people.  Might.  See back in the day shit like this happened and nobody did anything, or tried to do it ""peacefully"" or via government sanctioned measures and it got us nowhere.  So eventually people were just like ""fuck it"" and started breaking shit.  People just don't take to the streets off one incident.  You gotta build up that kind of rage over a lifetime.

It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear  3 of 8 that the plight of the negro poor has worsened over the last twelve or fifteen years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity."

And while you're at it probably some non-whitewashed American history books and social theory from black theorists (Du Bois, Patricia Hill Collins, etc.).

I don't know, but you're not playing devil's advocate because you just don't know what you're talking about.

blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,Hurinfan,11,Tue Apr 28 02:03:53 2015 UTC,"But black people who don't attack police officers also get shot or are treated with brutality. That's the issue. It's a HUGE pattern and people are getting sick of it. Black people are criminalized in this country. It happens way too frequently. So what I'm saying is your argument lacks context. If there were 2 isolated incidents that occurred in a vacuum where 2 black individuals attacking police officers got shot, then okay whatever. But there's a history of structural and systemic violence against black people, and so much of it comes from the police. So again, your argument is just lacking proper context."
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,mr_wafflesoft,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:30:42 2015 UTC,I agree fully with your points but I don't think that Brown and Martin are good examples. Using them as examples only weakens an already strong argument. And demonizing someone/ calling them racist because they changed their stance after evidence comes to light is just ignorant.   Scott and Garner are perfectly fine examples.  Also my argument isn't lacking proper context. /u/mashonem brought up those 2 incidents as examples. I wasn't talking about a system of inequality I was talking about 2 incidents and the fallout from those incidents.
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,Hurinfan,2,Tue Apr 28 02:33:47 2015 UTC,"I don't really know what you're getting at but it seems like a lot of generalizations. When evidence proves you were in the wrong I don't think many people would argue with that, but when someone goes off a hunch and shoots someone, that's the problem. Also not every action by a group of people reflects a whole race.  Say if there were a group of people who were violent in a school, does that make the other students who also attend that school violent too?   Final note: If evidence came out after a murder occurred, it shows that someone murdered another person for no reason and got off later. If that doesn't sound messed up to you, you might have an issue."

blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,Chael2Hell,30,Fri May 8 15:20:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I follow this sub because you guys are hilarious, but here recently I've noticed that your comments seem to be trending with racially charged ideas and prejudices. Can we talk about Baltimore, in a respectful discussion? Don't say that I'm more uncomfortable with looting and property damage than I am with a runaway police state fueled by oligarchy, because I'm not. But a greater evil does not justify a lesser one. The opportunists in these riots are attacking innocent people and local businesses; predominately white people are being attacked. I've seen video after video after video of random white people being attacked and brutalized. So don't say that doesn't happen. Aside from that, I'd like to ask as to what point do we recognize that this type of behavior is a cultural issue, without liberals and race-baiters screaming ""racist!""? I'd like for no one to misconstrue my words, as I'm really, REALLY trying to be as objective as possible.. I'm not saying that black culture is indicative of a failed or lesser people at all. I know it's hard for me as a white man to have anything BUT a subjective perspective on black culture. But what I can understand is that African-American culture has been perverted and destroyed by two centuries of U.S. government institutionalized racism, and unless something is done; some sort of discussion is prompted, the abrasive aspects of this culture can and will remain unchecked, and it will become self-perpetuating. The people looting in Baltimore are in no way representative of an entire culture, but their ideals and opportunistic behavior are not a qualities of an isolated incident. I'm 100% for police reformation, as modern police under the patriot act operate as a militarized body of political class-warfare enforcers-- although, antagonizing your oppressors by looting and vandalizing local businesses is NOT the way to champion healthy change. This type of behavior only reinforces racial prejudices and allows for police supporters to justify police brutality. Shame. I'm getting tired of seeing this stuff.   EDIT: I'm asking from the outside looking in if this is a cultural issue and if it is why is there not much focus on it.  EDIT: I also mean to implicate that if there is a cultural problem, it's not the culture that needs to be fixed first-- it's the catalyst which formed, or rather shaped the culture. i.e. the U.S. Government. The biggest problem ( and the problem from which stems almost every other problem ) with our government is money in politics. Laws made by the rich, for the rich. Black people being disproportionally targeted by police stem from that one big problem. Police are just enforcers of the laws set into motion by the oligarchs."
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,esosa233,24,Tue Apr 28 01:09:02 2015 UTC,"Because it isn't a cultural issue. It's a social class issue. The people in Baltimore are rioting because 1. Judicial system being biased against Blacks 2. The education system in Baltimore is trash. I'm not justifying the rioting because non-violence is always the best way when it comes to protesting, but the reason why we are seeing these protests across America is because the unfair judicial bombs have started blowing up across America with every Black person thats been slayne by the police. These protests are turning into riots because of an awful education system and poverty. Also this generation doesn't have a Martin Luther King Jr to lead them towards the right direction. Finally your seeing more and more posts/comments because it's awful across the rest of reddit. Exhibit A Exhibit B Exhibit C There was even one comment where a mexican guy was talking about how he hoped the police get more agressive with Black people because of it.  (EDIT) This comment does a better job than me at explaining"
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,Rayman13,4,Tue Apr 28 03:44:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.   And well, you say that it isn't a cultural issue, but my own personal experiences make me think differently. Although ( assuming you're black ) your words and experiences on your own culture probably trump mine.   It might just be my region, but a lot of the black people I know in my state and my hometown are raised up to hate white people.. It's sad. It's not just black people, but I'll just contrast them for the sake of the discussion. My mom was once chased down a street by a group of black girls throwing rocks at her and calling her a ""cracker"" because she was walking through ""their"" neighborhood. I mean, even me, growing up here I've been made fun of and treated differently because of my skin by students, teachers, shopkeepers, and hell, just random people on the street. It doesn't bother me, I just want to understand it.   I live in tallahatchie county, MS. Btw. It's a total shit hole. Sparsely populated but nonetheless populated with some of the most ignorant people you'll ever meet. Hicks from the hills, dicks from the delta."
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,Chael2Hell,14,Tue Apr 28 11:18:11 2015 UTC,"And well, you say that it isn't a cultural issue, but my own personal experiences make me think differently   see that's problem with Reddit you've generalized all Black's because of your limited experience with Southern Blacks"
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,PancakeMonkeypants,11,Tue Apr 28 06:59:45 2015 UTC,"Don't generalize southern blacks either, we actually have a thriving black middle class in many more civilized places in the south. He/she lives in a shithole, well then people are simply going to act shitty regardless of race that shouldn't be his/her image of the entire race."
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,PRESIDENT_KLAUS,11,Tue Apr 28 02:44:40 2015 UTC,Exactly. I'm going to try to give /u/Chael2Hell the benefit of the doubt because he seemed sincere. But you hit the nail on the head.
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,Karamaar,5,Tue Apr 28 03:16:42 2015 UTC,"Noooo. You got me all wrong. ( or maybe I've got ME all wrong..? ) It's very hard to generalize an entire race even remotely accurately. But a culture is different, and more easily defined than the people who created the culture. Not all blacks. Just black culture. Many people break their respective cultural norms, as is to be expected. So of course I don't equate culture to individuality, but if my only experiences with the culture are limited to interactions with my local peers, then that's all I have to go on.   Not saying ""all black people do this."" but asking ""why do some black people do this?""  But really, this is all besides the point. I appreciate the links, it's cool to accrue more knowledge"
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,redfatty888,4,Tue Apr 28 03:31:50 2015 UTC,Ahh I see what your saying now.  your already a step above a significant portion of reddit for having a civil discussion. Instead of just circlejerking that Blacks need to fix there culture.

blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,adrian_elliot,2,Tue Apr 28 06:27:49 2015 UTC,Dude you said it. I thought i was gonna go insane reading all these racist ass comments all over reddit
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,Rayman13,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:42:14 2015 UTC,"I think people are really missing out on the opportunity(as usual) to really dig deep into the issue of race and crime in the United States without flinging accusations of racism around.  It's well established that the black community is disproportionately targeted and impacted by the criminal justice system. However, there's also a reason for that: black communities tend to have higher crime rates. Now bear with me here, because I know that my previous statement is probably setting off some alarms and maybe raising some red flags.  BUT, and this is a very important but, there are other factors involved such as poverty. The poverty rate among Hispanics or black people is significantly higher than that of the white, non-Hispanic population. And where there's poverty, there's almost always crime.  But instead of talking about poverty being one of the root causes of high crime rates and the attention that those rates draw from law enforcement and the justice system, which could maybe potentially result in some actually good discussion focused on crime prevention in the guise of better economic opportunities/advancement, education, etc., everything will get bogged down in racist discussions where non-minorities will do their best to avoid being labeled racist, and thus, will avoid really confronting some uncomfortable topics that are hard to talk about in a mature manner."
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,yzlautum,5,Tue Apr 28 03:49:24 2015 UTC,"This type of behavior only reinforces racial prejudices and allows for police supporters to justify police brutality. Shame. I'm getting tired of seeing this stuff.    It's a shame that the violence that happens seems to justify police brutality in a lot of people's minds. But the fact of the matter is that there is always going to be violence during these things. When you are being unfairly and systematically repressed there is going to be a vindictive desire to strike back. As I saw another guy say in a different thread, one of America's most proud moments, the boston tea party, was exactly this. But unlike you, there are a lot of people out there refusing to be empathetic/understanding to the situation.  What's being asked of black people is what was asked of them when MLK led them. To take the oppression and anger straight on and turn the other cheek. To rise up and be the better man in order to create change. It's a hard ass thing to do and it's unfair that black people, the one's oppressed, are the ones who have to suffer to make progress. All we can do as white people (sorry for breaking rule 1) is try to be understanding and push to make things better from our side.   I'm getting tired of seeing this stuff.   We all are"
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,redfatty888,2,Tue Apr 28 03:58:16 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying.  It's hard to view these things objectively when you turn on the TV and you see black people destroying business, burning buildings and stomping on cars.  You turn on the news and every time that they're looking for a suspect for a crime it's a black man.  But the thing that you fail to realize is that the issue is poverty, not race. There is nothing inherent with black skin that makes a person more likely to be a criminal, however there is a very direct correlation between poor people and crime rates.  It also just so happens that the poorest, most impoverished neighborhoods in Baltimore are almost entirely black.  Fixing poverty is not easy, and this sort of trend has been around for generations, it's not going to happen over night.  I have to keep this in mind while I watch the news, because it's very, very easy to start with the racist thoughts.  It worries me that I even have those thoughts in the first place."

blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,Swisskisses,8,Tue Apr 28 04:05:32 2015 UTC,It's not that 1 cop is representative of all the police department but you have to understand two things  -In a lot of these police departments that get flak there is racism and corruption throughout that you can't understand unless you are living under their power  -Time and time again the policemen accused of abuse of power and even murder aren't put to trial or aren't convicted.

blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,Rayman13,5,Tue Apr 28 01:53:15 2015 UTC,"See. This: this is the problem.   It's an issue with some police officers. People like to talk about how cruel they are to the blacks but as a Latino it happens all the time to use.  I just, I wish I could articulate it the way I want to.  But this type of argument right here is going to get no where. Honestly. It's not a matter of white cops, and black guys. That would be too simple. This is an issue that has come from a deep underground that has been bubbling up for instances over the year. Yet I wish that this was all being handled differently.  And as for the protest, they broad casted all types of protest from the weekend that was a peaceful. But news is news and right now there are thousands of people rioting in the streets with violence. How do you expect anyone to ignore that and say ""oh, but this is happening on Saturday."" Only an idiot puts blame of all on one, but in this case there are still people doing wrong by rioting."

If you deny this you're not bright. So no I did not imply that only cops are the ones armed. Obviously that's not true and you're insulting my intelligence by saying otherwise. But I didn't see Walter Scott who was shot in the back several times by that cop in South Carolina waiving a firearm at the officer.. And that's one out of countless examples. Is that always the case? No it's not. But to say, ""Cops also don't just go around looking for unarmed black people to shoot. Don't be ignorant"" like /u/yzlautum said is being totally ignorant and foolish. Go on 90% of reddit and tell me how many ""mature"" conversations are going on right now regarding Baltimore. Because all I see is ""nigger this"" and ""nigger that"". The time to be mature is over. Unfortunately no change in this country will occur without violence and bloodshed. I wish it wasn't that way.

blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,yzlautum,-8,Tue Apr 28 10:17:50 2015 UTC,"(CNN)The arrest and death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore has stoked protests and accusations of police brutality. But it's unclear how Gray, arrested on a weapons charge April 12,   What we know: Gray was arrested on a weapons charge in a high-crime area of Baltimore  What we know: Court documents allege that Baltimore Police Department Officer Garrett Miller arrested Gray after finding a switchblade in his pocket. Police never saw the knife and chased Gray only after he ran from them, the attorney said.  The court documents also say that Gray ""fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.""  What we know: In the wake of Gray's death, six police officers have been suspended.  What we know: According to court documents CNN obtained, there were more than 20 criminal court cases in Maryland against Gray, and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death.  The cases involve mostly drug-related charges, but there are charges from March for second-degree assault and destruction of property.  On April 4, 2012, Gray was arrested for violating parole but he didn't go back to prison,    Such an angel.  (Quick edit: This is not saying that he deserved to die. I'm just pointing out shit about what was going on.)  http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/21/us/baltimore-freddie-gray-what-we-know/"
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,yzlautum,17,Tue Apr 28 13:01:38 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter if he had a criminal history or not.  He was unarmed and detained in police custody when he had his spine severed and died.  That is inexcusable.
blackpeoplegifs,3438x7,Rayman13,-10,Tue Apr 28 14:53:29 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. No one deserves to die unless they are armed and are putting cops or other people in danger.

blackpeoplegifs,33lmy1,a_monkie,2,Fri Apr 24 07:20:05 2015 UTC,"Percentage point:       A percentage point (pp) is the unit for the arithmetic difference of two percentages, e.g. going from 1% to 9% is an 8 percentage point increase. [citation needed]  Consider the following hypothetical example: In 1980, 40 percent of the population smoked, and in 1990 only 30 percent smoked. One can thus say that from 1980 to 1990, the incidence of smoking decreased by 10 percentage points although smoking did not decrease by 10 percent (actually it decreased by 25 percent) – percentages indicate ratios, not differences.  Percentage point differences are one way to express a risk or probability. Consider a drug that cures a given disease in 70 percent of all cases, while without the drug, the disease heals spontaneously in only 50 percent of cases. The drug reduces absolute risk by 20 percentage points. Alternatives may be more meaningful to consumers of statistics. The such as the reciprocal (also known as the number needed to treat (NNT)). In this case, the reciprocal transform of the percentage point difference would be 1 / (20%) = 1 / 0.20 = 5, i.e., if 5 patients are treated with the drug, one could expect to heal one more case of the disease than would have occurred in the absence of the drug.

blackpeoplegifs,32gr6t,jack_skellington,5,Tue Apr 14 00:09:29 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STafN9HdweA  Got a bunch of noobs here thinking that this is clever:   ""What is a ratchet good for?  Getting nuts off.""   ...and therefore it must be the etymology/origin of the word.  It's not.  Ratchet = wretched  ""Getting nuts off"" is new shit.  And not particularly clever, anyway.  EDIT: sigh  I did more work and discovered that the word originated from Anthony Mandigo's grandmother, as a slang term that she used for ghetto people.  Anthony Mandigo recorded ""Do the Ratchet"" in 1999, and it flopped, but his label kept it going with a re-release in 2004 featuring Lava House & Lil Boosie.  In the liner notes of the CD it was defined as this: ""To be ghetto, real, gutter, nasty.""  A grandmother giving a put-down to someone ghetto/gutter is far more likely to ""wretched"" with a southern drawl on it than it is to be a not-clever saying about getting nuts off.  Especially since that phrase doesn't appear at all in reference to the word until extremely recently."

blackpeoplegifs,30dj07,DrowningInFeces,5,Thu Mar 26 17:11:35 2015 UTC,In trade school here. We are only half way through the program and some dumbasses think they know more than the instructors. EXAGGERATED EYE ROLL IN YOUR DIRECTION
blackpeoplegifs,30dj07,User1-1A,15,Fri Mar 27 01:44:23 2015 UTC,Had a guy like this at a company I used to work for. He was hired on as a graphic artist for web design and didn't know the fundamentals of HTML. He sent out a company wide email saying that it was important for everyone on the web team to learn java script. I never wanted to punch someone in the face so bad.
blackpeoplegifs,30dj07,TheMarEffect,2,Thu Mar 26 17:44:42 2015 UTC,i can see why he said that  because javascript alot better for alot of reasons but still everyone who is adept at javascript has a solid background in html.
blackpeoplegifs,30dj07,krelin,2,Sun Mar 29 16:05:28 2015 UTC,The CCO was hired to spite our creative director. When we looked at his portfolio it only consisted of print media. He hired this guy with no web experience.  I'm sure you can see where this is going.

I've been trained by someone that had no business training anyone before. I suspect they made him train me to test him, and probably because I looked 'black' and they thought I wasn't going to get far anyway. Racists."

blackpeoplegifs,3098jr,kingeryck,-2,Thu Mar 26 04:07:09 2015 UTC,"I would totally spit on someone, but only if I was getting ready to fight them."
blackpeoplegifs,3098jr,Dank_Turtle,10,Wed Mar 25 20:13:39 2015 UTC,The correct answer is no one in their right mind would spit on someone.

But I remember a few months after I was watching VH1 and out of nowhere they started airing I Love Money 4, which was wrapping up filming just as the Ryan Jenkins thing was happening, and I was SOOOO stoked.  Also obligatory shoutout to my boy Real, one of my favorite cast members in all of the shows. He died of cancer earlier this year, R.I.P. Stallionaire"
