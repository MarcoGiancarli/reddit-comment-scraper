india,3e1255,heronumberwon,15,Tue Jul 21 05:00:40 2015 UTC,"Before the British traders subdued the local rulers and became rulers instead, the various regions of India enjoyed high prosperity from industry, commerce and above all a remarkable state of excellent agricultural production. In their own accounts, the British writers bear testimony to the fact. Luke Scrafton, a member of Robert Clive's Council, in his book Reflections of the Government of Hindustan (1770) mentions,       In passing through the Rampore (present day Rampur, Uttar        Pradesh, India] territory, we could not fail to notice the high      state of cultivation which it had attained....If the comparison      for the same territory be made between the management of       the Rohillas and that of our own Government, it is painful to      think that the balance of advantage is clearly in favour of the      former.    Sir John Malcolm visited the Maratha country around 1803 and according to his records,       'It has not happened to me ever to see countries better      cultivated, and more abounding in all produce of the soil,      as well as in commercial wealth, than the southern      Maharashtra districts....Poona, the capital of Peshwah,    was very wealthy and a thriving commercial town, and    there was as much cultivation in the Deccan as it was     possible an arid and unfruitful country would admit.    The situation, however became different when the British occupied the sub-continent.

Hobabswam (sp?) explains at great length at how the British did not ""industrialise"" India, but deindustrialised it. He gives an example of the Wootz steel industry which had a whole chain of industries (cottage albeit) running - Coal > Iron > Steel > Swordsmiths > The guilds that exported these.  25 years after the British - the entire industry was destroyed.  I would be in the wrong not to mention the other theory for this deindustrialisation - this theory holds that Britain not only destroyed the traditional industries (mostly cotton and textiles) in India, but in Europe also. Only in Europe, those who lost their livelihood could join the nearest factory and eke out a living. This theory (just as compelling) argues that it was the industrial scale of Britain competing with the cottage scale of India and other traditional economies that destroyed the trade and caused the deindustrialisation.  Both theories have +/-'s and quite frankly the Jury is still out on them."

The corollary of that was that urban population growth caused its own public health problems... all the things we associate with overcrowding now.   I just read this top comment on the TIL thread. Searched a bit and apparently, its a blatant lie.  http://www.populstat.info/Asia/indiac.htm  The table clearly shows that in 1800 the population of India was 255,000,000 but by 1881 the population had decreased to 201,888,100   In fact if you take a closer look in 1875, India's population was 300,963,000 but by 1881 it was 201,888,100.

india,3e1255,suraj1989,3,Tue Jul 21 07:53:42 2015 UTC,"The British did some horrible things and exacerbated a lot of problems. But it's worth noting that South India suffered from famines every 40 years prior to the British.  There's also a book called Famine: As a Geographical Phenomenon which goes into great detail about pre-British famines in South India. It provides a chart on page 78 that summarizes some of the data they've gathered. Can't copy+paste, but I'll jot down what it says.  1390-91 - Famine due to drought  1396 - Famine due to drought  1472 - Famine due to drought  1540 - Famine due to drought  1614 - Famine due to civil war  1648 - Famine due to drought  1659 - 1662 - Famine due to warfare and drought  1677 - Famine due to flood  1709-21 - Famine due to drought  1733 - Famine due to neglect of irrigation works  The book states:   Famine had long been a part of life in that part of southern India which became the Madras Presidency in the nineteenth century. The area has always been prey to natural disaster -- drought, flood, tropical cyclone, insect infestations -- and warfare between major kingdoms and empires was relatively common, particularly after 1400 AD. Although a complete account of the pre-European period of Indian history is nonexistent, the evidence suggests that a major famine took place every forty years (Dando 1980). What evidence we have from Madras Presidency suggests that from the twelfth century onwards, the incidence of famine may have been more frequent than this, but certainly nowhere near as often as in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  From the twelfth century to the sixteenth century, the study area [South India] averaged two to three major famines each century. All of these can be attributed to natural causes, either drought or flood. We should note that the prevalence of famine in the Deccan in the late fourteenth century, and none of the Deccan famines (1412-13, 1423, and 1472) of the fifteenth century are included in this counting.   Also, the Vijayanagara Empire was a golden period in South Indian history right before the British. This graph from a reasonably well known work among those who study famines (Naturalizing Disaster) provides some information. From 1300 to 1600, there were 9 recorded famines.  https://html1-f.scribdassets.com/8isqb92ywwzbm97/images/11-ab8c8776d4.jpg"

Something to note how little officials are paid, their children qualify for free/reduced (pay a small percentage only) lunches at school, because the parent doesn't make enough per year, they are in the lower income bracket.

You saw what our support and our vote bank is capable of. She got her post back and she will get all charges dropped soon. You still think this is forward caste nation right ?

Take example of Muslims, Hindu right wing actually loves it when terrorist attacks happen in India so that they can do hate mongering and do atrocities against Muslims. And more atrocities are done against Muslims then more Muslim youth wants to be terrorists. And cycle continues. Similarly more you guys discriminate against dalits the more our vote bank will strengthen. And dumbass check how sc/st population % is increasing in modern India.

Never said you are stupid or ugly. But go ahead be more offended and act more oppressed. You are basically a troll and you can keep on trolling. Being oppressed and offended are the main aims of your life anyway.   Take example of Muslims, Hindu right wing actually loves it when terrorist attacks happen in India so that they can do hate mongering and do atrocities against Muslims. And more atrocities are done against Muslims then more Muslim youth wants to be terrorists. And cycle continues.   Umm no. Some hindu right wingers hate monger. Which means some radical muslims imams get material they need to convert people over to their cause. And this statement is valid without the hindu right wingers portion too. Look at the world and see why ISIS hates US. Why taliban existed. Someone different to one group screws up, stereotypes form and now we have issues. Which is basically where you come in, because you want to buy into the story. You can spin this however you want, but the sad part is thats the truth.    Similarly more you guys discriminate against dalits the more our vote bank will strengthen. And dumbass check how sc/st population % is increasing in modern India.

Already sc/st are 28%+ and Muslims 14%+ and you guys keep hating on Christians too.  Dumbass we got our vote bank which is capable of making any party or government bow down.   Votebanks will last only so long. I can only hope people (all castes/religion) have more than the little peanut brain you have to realize and figure this out.  If you want to argule other wise, as long as you want to play vote bank vote bank, all the castes will fight. And eventually someone else will win. Then you can sit and whine about how you are being oppressed even though you are X% of the population. Because that is your get out card for anything. I am sure when you fell down the stairs when you were young, it was because some forward caste person polished them too much for you to slip on (or whatever other equally ridiculous example you can dream of here).    Don't forget 67- 3 result in Delhi stupid.   This was the best line. What does that have to do with anything here. Its not a cricket score that you keep repeating. I dont care for any of the parties so you throwing this in there is meaning less to me. But just to see where you are going with this, lets go through this - Kejriwal won handsomely.. no doubt. What now? Has delhi improved? The guy is proving to be better than RG (that doesnt even require any effort) and no worse/better than Modi. Being in political power and chasing after it are not the same thing and he has shown that he cannot use his power as he projected. Does he have potential to get this sorted out - yes. Will he sort it out - no. The cycle will continue.   Kejriwal won because BJP couldnt decide whether to attack or defend and because he organized a grassroots level campaign. Lets see how he does after a few years in power and then decide the impact of this 67-3 bs you want to throw around. It means nothing just as BJP thrashing congress nationally means nothing."

Else atrocities against dalits will skyrocket if people thought otherwise. And basically she asked us for help. When she came back to India she visited place where ambedkar's remains, ashes are being kept. Considering most of Indian society is still casteist we had to help her.

Don't you remember at first even RSS and modi supported her. She was a symbol of our nation's sovereignty if I remember correctly. Today she is just headache and embarrassment for us which we would like to pretend never existed.

These are decisions that you will have to carry forward for a very long time to come, so if it's something you do not even like to begin with, there's a very good chance that you'll hate it after a while. I'm sorry if your parents do not agree with what you want, but you're just going to have to take this decision for yourself if that is the case. Strike out doing what you like. They're your parents; they might be displeased for a while, but they'll come around soon.  Also, contrary to what a lot of other people are suggesting here, I don't really see anything positive coming about out of getting an online pal to talk to. Real world friends are excellent, but  people tend to get more withdrawn as they make more and more connections online.  Good luck."

People know you but the only one who understand u is urself. So decide what u want to do and go for it. Mostly giving time n not taking life changing decision helps. In other words, you can go for marriage now or after 2-5yrs. Does not make any difference.  If not interested in job, then also start with something small atleast to cover ur expense. Reading/Writing are good for hobby, takes totally different approach to make money out of it. Still you have many options.  What you like to write about - Technology/Politics/arts/etc based on ur likes there are options and platforms. 1-2yr is long time to get noticed by somebody who can offer job in ur field of interest.  Photography - There are course and classes for it, from there u can get contacts and good tips. that's one direction to move but depends if parents will let you  Any time you are confused or feel depressed. Dnt get into making decision... Go for walk, write whats in ur mind . write what are options, write which option is viable and most suitable, write how capable you are for each option, write what influence others will have for each option and how you will tackle them. write other adversaries.  Ur best friend is u and by writing you start talking to urself.  Finally, anything you do or think of doing talk n discuss with your parents. Dey might go against or they might back you. Whatever be the case always be true to them in what ever you do.   For now -  Give time to urself  New path you choose will be different. Difficult or challenging is up to you"

Is there something specific in your mind? Journalism? Writing novels? Portrait/wedding photography etc? Are you serious about having any of these your career for the rest of your life? Parents will force you to get married or get govt job all the time. All Indian parents do it to all their children all the time.  Choose a path and take the plunge. You're smart, you're figure it out on your way. The only thing you shouldn't do is wallow in sadness. If you've just graduated, its natural to feel depressed - happens to most of us. Don't do things to please your parents. Do what you're really passionate about. If you have nothing concrete in your mind, choose a great job closely related to your college major.

The life will always present with many other choices, some of which may not be apparent.         Get Married ? I have said this before on this sub and would say it again, do not marry as an option/peer pressure/blah blah.. the only reason one should get married is because they really want to spend the entirety of life with that special person. Our parents were raised differently so I always understand they are not really open to a lot of other views, but slowly they can be conditioned. Most parents at the end want the happiness of their child, which somehow they think they know the best but mostly they don't. Don't let that stop you from anything, don't pay attention to all those lectures. Although its good to have some friends to talk to but take your happiness in your hands, moment you are dependent on someone for it, you would realize it wont last long. Ask yourself what makes you really happy (not be read same as hobby). If those things are feasible enough start doing them. Again your parents wont stop lecturing you, you will have to learn living ignoring it. If you love writing combine it with some travel and the pictures, there you go you would have a blog ready. We feel happy when we make things happen, things which just happen out of luck wont make you happy in the long term, so just go for it, start with baby steps and find your happiness.

Ended up with $20 net revenue from Ads in 4th year.  Started inkmat.com with a friend during final exams to kill some free time (who wants to study!) where we print Instagram photos. The site's doing fairly well earning just enough to pay rent.  In the meanwhile, I got a job at a startup which was doing decent. After working with the startup for a year, decided that I should quit and 15th of this month was my last day.  Made one more android app which got some publicity and is another stream of income (not really impressive but good enough to afford modest lifestyle).  My friend who started inkmat with me also quit his job and we are working on improving and automating the business.  We both haven't really given 100% to any business yet so we don't think we need to hire anyone. And when we thought we needed some help, freelancers were available (and easier to work with).  We haven't thought of taking any funding yet, just trying to make our ends meet.  We are from Jaipur but we decided not to work from there because Mumbai is so much easier to run a business from.

Amendment: The Amendment has removed the minimum requirement for one-person, private and public companies. Now, this still raises questions (can you incorporate a company and issue no capital whatsoever?), but it is clear that starting a business will be cheaper.

A meeting where I wasn't supposed to be there and would never thought would pitch.  After that, I started believing in the famous phrase, right place at right time."
india,3e1spg,IvoryStory,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:00 2015 UTC,"Once you started, how long did it take to get the first round of funding?"
india,3e1spg,mn_g,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:23 2015 UTC,"First round made sure money didn't expire before we went to 2nd.  In my experience, I would suggest start raising funds when you have 6-9months runway. And to successfully run the company without head aches, make sure at least 6 months worth of cash is in the bank. That will give a lot of mental peace and it goes a long way."

This was the starting point of my company.  I started Vihar Innovations LLP in 2014, had it planned before completion of my engineering degree. Incorporation took a month, and Rs 10000, that was the only funding.    How struggling it was to get team ?   Still struggling to get a team. Thinking to start training in web technologies and technical market analysis, for recruiting talent.   How's it is going ?   Its going well. The prediction service xPredict had maximum of 16 clients, but I did focus on new web development technologies, which will be used in two new services, to be launched with bitcoin payment. Have great expectations from the new projects, which are being coded right now.  The prediction service had been very accurate since our inception, I had trademarked xPredict, to expand technical analysis service to BSE/NSE, but SEBI  introduced costly license and rules in 2014 September. So, its now planned for NYSE/NASDAQ and other foreign exchanges."

The other girl and I were doing pretty damn well even though we had differences in vision and opinions. I was the baker, she was the decorator.  6 months later we were invited to set up a stall at some company's Christmas fair. They told us 300 people would be there. Baked impossible amounts of cakes and cookies night after night after coming back from office. 30 people showed up. And even those 30... Everyone was interested in the free samples. Very few people bought anything. Cheapsters.  Ended up losing Rs20k+ at the event so at the end of those 6 months we each made 250 bucks :/ I was so frustrated with the situation, after working so hard, we kind of disbanded...

india,3e11gh,Bernard_Woolley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:00:03 2015 UTC,"technically, she did not have diplomatic immunity for the job she was doing, and the crimes were allegedly in US.   This is incorrect; her position with the UN granted her full diplomatic immunity.  And whether she had full immunity or not is a moot point. When a prosecutor arrests a diplomat from a supposedly allied country like a common thief and subjects them to a 'cavity search', any country would protest.  This was an obvious political stunt by Preet Bharara, and the Waffle House corporate office State Department leadership f***ed up by not reigning him in.  Most countries handle such situations with a little more discretion. Diplomats caught breaking the law are quietly declared PNG and kicked out without raising a fuss. That's what the GOTUS should have done. Instead they arrest an Indian diplomat and ""evacuate"" Indian citizens embroiled in a court case from India. You should read what Robert Blackwill had to say about such shenanigans."

The NDTV article is in contrast a claim that was made at that time, but it will be best if you then find a documentation of validation of the said claim too?

india,3e11gh,evereddy,5,Tue Jul 21 07:09:08 2015 UTC,"like i said in another comment: whether people in her designation should have diplomatic immunity is an issue which GoI should negotiate with US government independently.  the status quo at that time point was that she had no immunity. So your argument ""the US has no authority or right to touch her"" is technically wrong, even if it is a wishful thinking!"
india,3e11gh,RajaRajaC,3,Tue Jul 21 07:14:40 2015 UTC,"Technicality aside, she was an Indian Diplomat on official deputation not some random tourist violating their laws.  She still is protected by the Indian state and ultimately the US had to acknowledge this issue."
india,3e11gh,evereddy,3,Tue Jul 21 07:23:07 2015 UTC,"sometimes geopolitics goes beyond right and wrong. US federal government created a escape out for her, so that Indo-US relations could be re-normalised. there are really much more important things at stake for the bilateral relations. It does not mean that anything was acknowledged. In fact, she has been re-indicted for those crimes in US.   I agree with you s far as that probably GoI should negotiate diplomatic immunity for people in her designation, but that is/was not the case.   the other issue which was never addressed in those arguments is simple: let's even agree that US had no right to prosecute her because of whatever immunity, but was a crime done by her at all or not? because most apologists claim(ed) that she was even blameless. It will be refreshing to hear your opinion on just that aspect on whether she did something wrong and abused her diplomatic privileges or not - vis a vis her domestic help."
india,3e11gh,RajaRajaC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:31:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was the US giving us an out as much as both sides working together to minimise impact. Don't forget, we are a huge market, and just when this issue was happening, we also had to sign on a $ 2.5 Bn Orion aircraft deal (of course the fucking pusillanimous UPA signed it, just as it was 'threatening strong action' publicly is another issue) and this issue could not be allowed to detract from the overall progress.  Anyhoo, about the case...multiple dimensions to it.  Firstly, I am not even sure our mid level staffers in the consulates are paid as per the US rates - the salaries are still capped to Indian norms. I don't think it is feasible for nations to adjust salaries and wages to suit local conditions. That aside, it was a total case of he said / she said, and it is a matter of taking Devyani's word over Sangeetha's word (or vice versa).  My own biased opinion? She is scum, her father is scum, she lied to her own department about her children's visas and I wouldn't put it past her to ill treat the  help. I have seen such 'high and mighty' people up close and they seriously treat their help like less than dirt."
india,3e11gh,evereddy,2,Tue Jul 21 08:57:57 2015 UTC,I agree with you that US & India tried to work out a solution to normalize relations - that is why I said geopolitics and bilateral relation - it was in the interest of both countries.
india,3e11gh,anondude47,4,Tue Jul 21 09:40:41 2015 UTC,"Yet, the US has no authority or right to touch her.   Her crimes were committed on their land and they were crimes according to their laws.

india,3e11gh,RajaRajaC,8,Tue Jul 21 07:22:35 2015 UTC,"I don't remember the case exactly now, as /u/everreddy says otherwise, but diplomatic immunity covers everything from murder to arson to rape.

india,3e11gh,evereddy,3,Tue Jul 21 07:08:26 2015 UTC,"supporting her at any level for correct reasons is fine. Likewise, supporting her at any level for wrong reasons is not. that's my opinion anyway ... as for the specific incident, I have no comments, it is water under the bridge."

The MEA spokesperson, too, cited the ongoing case and declined comment. In December, the Centre had revoked the passports of the two children but Justice Shakdher of the high court stayed the order in May.In the affidavit, the government defended its decision, saying Khobragade obtained Indian diplomatic passports for her daughters by suppressing material facts which established that she wilfully and blatantly violated the Indian passport act.With acquiring of US passports, the children had acquired US nationality and had ceased to be Indian citizens, the government said.Serving as Indias deputy consul-general in New York, Khobragade was arrested in 2013 on charges of visa fraud and underpaying her nanny, leading to a diplomatic standoff.After a prolonged tussle she was able to return to India. The 39-year-old, however, ran into trouble again and was stripped of her responsibilities with the MEA in December 2014. Reinstated in March, Khobragade is the director of states division at the MEA headquarters.

The smaller engine was first tested successfully on January 5, 2014, but is not as powerful as the cryogenic engine tested today.When the country does finally fulfil the long cherished dream of launching Indian astronauts from Indian soil using Indian rockets, the GSLV is expected to be rocket that will be used.Scientists at ISRO say they will take seven years from the time that they get a go-ahead from the government, to make that possible.

Please submit a picture that shows that you've chosen either UberGo, UberX, or UberBlack.  When the kaali-peeli taxis were on strike recently, Uber chose to consciously operate at the rate of a kaali-peeli.  And as someone here pointed out, you aren't obliged to travel by Uber. If you think their service is expensive then avoid them. Uber shows you how much your trip is going to cost, if it's expensive for you, then take the normal cabs.

india,3e1vyh,chupchap,2,Tue Jul 21 11:49:10 2015 UTC,"UberIntercity is when you want to travel from Mumbai to Pune. And when you are about to book a taxi using Uber, you can see all the available options - UberGo, UberX, UberBlack, and UberIntercity. Once you enter your destination, you can the fare for each of Uber's sub-brands.  The minimum fare for UberGo is Rs. 60 - UberX is Rs. 100 - UberBlack is Rs. 150, and UberINTERCITY is Rs. 3,999, which is the price that OP has put up in his picture, which leads me to believe that he's lying.  Uber is not regulated by the government. Should it be? I don't know. Local autos and taxis are price-regulated by the government. But also keep in mind that private vehicle can charge you as per their wish.  My drawing parallels with the 5-start hotel was to suggest that it isn't fair to argue about the price when you know that eating at a 5-star hotel is going to be expensive. Uber tells you how much your ride is going to cost you, and if you think it's expensive, take a taxi. No one's forcing you to travel by Uber."
india,3e1vyh,AiyyoIyer,2,Tue Jul 21 12:00:00 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, from the icon it looked like Uber X. Does intercity have a diff icon? That's one way to know the truth.    But also keep in mind that private vehicle can charge you as per their wish.   Taxis are pvt vehicles too :)   Also Uber or even Ola does not give you the exact price. it gives you an approximate price range. That might go up depending on the traffic you run into. That said, this might support your theory. In this screenshot Uber is showing a fixed rate instead of a range."
india,3e1vyh,chupchap,-19,Tue Jul 21 12:35:44 2015 UTC,"It is UberIntercity. That's their icon for it. It's an SUV which is what UberIntercity is often used for.  Taxis are not private vehicles. They are called public transportation for a reason. The meters in taxis are put up by the government which decides the taxi fare among other things. Taxi drivers have to wear a uniform, private driver don't need to. They have a batch that they get from the government.  And yes, Uber and other show you an approximate range of the fare. A lot depends upon the traffic and other unforeseeable circumstances. Also it is the same for an auto or a taxi ride. Traffic is the same for both, no."
india,3e1vyh,AiyyoIyer,8,Tue Jul 21 12:42:45 2015 UTC,Ah okay so that solves it then. This post is misinformation.
india,3e1vyh,chupchap,-10,Tue Jul 21 15:42:41 2015 UTC,Also Uber or even Ola does not give you the exact price   They give you the exact price per minute and km. It is upto you how much you consume
india,3e1vyh,110011001100,6,Tue Jul 21 18:28:17 2015 UTC,"Replying here to satisfy the egos of you assholes. Yes! I didn't see that it was Uber Intercity.  I dun goofed. So my mistake. I admit it.   Having said that, I am really surprised to realize that people dont mind paying twice or thrice the agreed price in peak times. They are rightly quoting the rulebook. Just like Taxis and autos charging extra are wrong, how is dynamic pricing any different? The ONLY defense I see is that they are a private service and dont need to follow RTO rules. So inadvertantly proving the case that private cab companies need to be regulated to be held in line or else this is what they do if they are given a free hand.   Using the same example, why should a shopkeeper not raise the prices of medicines, packaged goods during shortage and sell ABOVE MRP. Why not. Just because it is statutorily barred? Why should he be forced out of market considerations of demand and supply.   The argument that Uber is a private company, take it or leave it is precisely how private companies end up holding the market to ransom. Sort of like a drug dealer. First lure you with freebies.  The ethics of Uber businesses are still being questioned and debated online. many of these articles may discuss overlapping issues involving Uber and its business practices   uber can track commuters using ""God View"" same article as above - Uber spied on journos to get some dirt on them to vilify and negate their stories Uber plays dirty most ethically challenged company Uber dealing with competition Uber attacking journos (not like vyapam) uber not responsible for acts of their drivers uber shady marketing   Uber, like any other recent startup, has an army of internet shills hired specifically to challenge and trump down any questions about their business practices.  Again, the fare of 3999 is for intercity. Its my mistake. But don't make uber out to be some corporate messiah out here to solve problems of kaali peelis.   edit - formatting"
india,3e1vyh,AiyyoIyer,-8,Tue Jul 21 13:15:09 2015 UTC,"Aside from your misleading picture, here's what I think of the rest.  You're surprised that people are ready to pay a surge in price? Well some people prefer to travel comfortably than to wait on road, wiggling their thumb like an idiot as taxi and auto driver whiz past ferrying Mr. India.  A person who travels by taxi on a daily basis wouldn't mind taking Uber if it were to cost just as much, or maybe a little more. Like I said, it's about preferences, if you don't mind the price, then it shouldn't bother you.  Should Uber and the likes be regulated by the government? I don't know. It is a call that the government should take and one that Uber should care about. If Uber is given a free hand and they charge customers hefty fares, then I am sure the customers would opt out of Uber. People aren't stupid, you know.  Shopkeepers can sell items that are more than the MRP. But they don't because the companies that sell those item give the shopkeepers good margin so they sell the item for nothing more than the MRP. Uber gives you a free ride if you refer it to your friend. They're taking a loss too!  When Meru entered the market, I didn't see anyone complain about its pricing. Mind you, Meru is far more expensive than Uber, Ola and any radio cab.  I wouldn't comment on the ethics of Uber. I don't trust the media to not take money from OLA or Lyft to write unfavourable articles about the competition. If there's one area that Uber and OLA need to improve it is the training of their drivers. I can't stress that enough.  I am no Uber spokesman. I'd gladly be, if they promise me more free rides!"
india,3e1vyh,anondude47,6,Tue Jul 21 13:33:01 2015 UTC,"See i agree with the fact that its not UBERs problem. But i disagree with the premise that that companies should decide on a case to case basis (like when it rains or peak times) what to charge customers. Its like if you are in a hospital, the doctor will decide based on your level of pain on how much to charge you. It is not a desirable practice because we dont know the factors on how they calculate peak time and how they calculate the fares. Its basically their own word on how they arrived at 2x or 3x the price.   Ifs and buts about Meru is just post facto references to divert the topic.  I leave it up to you to deny anything written only because it comes from the media (separate unrelated sources) and actually question the ethics of higlightling uber practices!!   I am no Uber hater either. But what is wrong is wrong. and marking up prices during rains in the name of Dynamic pricing is just as wrong as taxi autowalas claiming higher amount during rains."
india,3e1vyh,anondude47,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:50:22 2015 UTC,"Uber isn't a public service dude. They have no requirement to maintain some price range. By that logic, Apple should be sued to hell and high heaven for working with a hefty 45% margin and keeping many apps out of reach of the public. Doesn't make sense, does it?"
india,3e1vyh,anondude47,2,Tue Jul 21 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"before we get carried away, taxis are a recurring service and are needed on a daily basis. Phone are not required to be bought everyday and its price is fixed regardless of circumstances. no matter how high it is. Apple doesnt decide wily nily  that since iphones are in short supply, dynamic pricing will apply and now people have to pay twice"
india,3e1vyh,anondude47,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:44:42 2015 UTC,"You clearly don't understand basic economics. Or you're pretending not to. It doesn't matter what kind of service it is - recurring or one time. It doesn't matter what the product is - a smart phone or a taxi. It doesn't matter what economy it is - the US or India. All consumption is decided by the consumer.  If Uber sees that the majority of the customers are not willing to pay their prices, they will reduce it. If they see the demand is more than what they have at the current price, they will increase the price. The term is ""maximising surplus"".  Your concern, otoh, should be about ""cartelisation"". That won't happen any time in the near term the way the taxi industry looks.  Oh. And also,   Apple doesnt decide wily nily that since iphones are in short supply, dynamic pricing will apply and now people have to pay twice   Apple can do that and nobody can stop them ... except the consumers who will flip them the finger and move to other devices."
india,3e1vyh,strayadvice,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:07 2015 UTC,So basically Uber will see and decide how the prices will be fixed for a service that is required daily. Without providing so much of an explanation. We have no choice but to accept what they term as peak and dynamic pricing. OTOH taxis and autos will have to go by RTO mandated rates. Ok.
india,3e1vyh,GuydeMeka,2,Tue Jul 21 16:07:25 2015 UTC,"Yes. If you don't understand why or how, you need to read economics."

Medicines and other such essential goods' prices are subsidized by the govt because they are essential. It's not like the govt is forcing the companies to sell at a loss.

They might not rank up there with medicines but they certainly form the backbone of any commuting infra in a city.   The question is who decides the price.

However, this doesn't mean that discrimination DOES NOT exist either. Please check the link in my parent comment. It was found that a people standing 50m apart are shown remarkably different rates - surge vs no surge.  There's a lot of research on discriminatory pricing online. Here's one recent paper from authors at CMU and Berkeley. One thing they found out was that Males were shown higher paying jobs than females. Just had lunch with the second author Michael Carl Tschantz from ICSI, Berkeley. Let me know if you want further reading links on this topic."

Coming to the point, we don't know for sure how the Uber algorithm works, and to think it's discriminating on the basis of religion is laughable. As for the 50m apart thing - that article is correct, Uber does divide the city into high- and low-demand areas, for which billing may differ. I thought this was common knowledge by know? Uber makes it crystal clear beforehand what they're charging you - as /u/AiyyoIyer said, if you don't like it, don't use the service."

Here's how our conversation went    Me : X can discriminate on sensitive data  You : They aren't asking this data; so I am safe  Me : No silly, this sensitive data can be inferred even if you don't ask for it  You : Uber is discriminating on religion is laughable!   An example is used to be an example - I didn't say Uber did do what is in that example.   we don't know for sure how the Uber algorithm works   This IS the problem.    What is Uber doing to give you a surge price?  Is it using your credit card type - Visa or Master?  Is Uber using your past historical ride data to recommend you a surge price?   Uber's algorithms are opaque and NOT transparent is the point."

I am trying to make three simple broader points    Online price discrimination is a reality - check some links which I've shared here.  Online algorithms are NOT transparent - you get an illusion of transparency  You do NOT need to collect sensitive data to have sensitive data. For example, locations/neighborhood could highly correlate to race. Your phone model could correlate to income status etc.    Given these points, it is important to study how Uber algorithms work. It is enough food for thought to audit such algorithms. If you have time, read more on this subject here are a couple of links  When Algorithms Discriminate  Gillian Tett gets it very wrong on racial profiling  How big data is unfair"

india,3e1vyh,blueintrigue,4,Tue Jul 21 10:05:36 2015 UTC,"not familiar with ola, but uber is a point to point cab service that charges tiered rates (by car/driver type) for distance plus modest fees. during weather or heavy demand, they charge surge rates which is a multiplier of their normal rates.   last night i was seeing it as high as 2.6 the normal pricing. if you do that plus one of their more expensive services, it can get quite pricey."
india,3e1vyh,jrjk,3,Tue Jul 21 10:50:53 2015 UTC,so the drivers get to decide the price? ola also states they may charge extra during peak hours but I haven't had to pay that in bangalore.

It's to encourage drivers to accept calls during the rain or other events where usually the supply drop automatically (usually because much higher chance of accident coupled with high deposits for rented cars/taxis)  Bu then again there should be a cap on the number of multiple you can have for the base price. 4X is actually too high for just rain. So yea, id say pitchforks down, but dining forks welcome!"
india,3e1vyh,givafux,4,Tue Jul 21 10:21:13 2015 UTC,"Correct. It's due to their surge pricing algorithm, which kicks in whenever demand is greater than supply. And the multiplier is purely determined by the demand. It's freemarket economics. If people feel that 4x is too high and stop booking cabs the multiplier will fall. Uber updates the multiplier every 2 minutes. So, it's pretty transparent, dynamic, and fair.  And the reason I defend it is that it actually works. It does help in getting more cars (by both increasing supply and reducing demand). I would not pay the surge rates unless I have an emergency. But, I'd much rather have expensive cars available for booking than no cars available at all.  Ola also adopted it now, but their method is less transparent and the surge rates are capped."
india,3e1vyh,RajaRajaC,-2,Tue Jul 21 11:02:55 2015 UTC,"Listen to this guy, he gets it. The other day Uber was 2.4 when we had to hail one, we waited for 5 or so mins and it came to 1.3. I 'deduced' the movie for which there must be a weekend rush must have started."
india,3e1vyh,denzil_correa,3,Tue Jul 21 11:14:51 2015 UTC,"So, it's pretty transparent, dynamic, and fair.   hahaha no, man. how is it fair? Free market economics doesnt mean you change the fares every couple of minutes. Im not an expert but Im pretty sure thats not what free market economics means.   You're right in the sense that the prices are high due to demand and very little supply, but that would mean Uber needs to up their stock (or fleet) to meet these demands without fleecing the customer."
india,3e1vyh,indian_style_toilet,-4,Tue Jul 21 11:25:04 2015 UTC,"Upping the fleet doesn't happen magically. That's something that might take months since Uber's popularity has skyrocketed in the last one year. What do do until then?  I called the system transparent and fair as I can normally look at screen for a few seconds and guess whether the surge will increase or decrease based on the number of cabs at the area and the rate at which they are getting booked.  Also, the rapid fare change is actually good. I actually want them to reduce the update frequency to 1 min. That'll allow the surge prices to both climb and fall faster. Currently, even in case demand drops I've to wait up to 10 minutes for fares to get back to 1x.  Finally, don't get me wrong. Surge pricing is annoying. And it has inconvenienced me on a number of occasions. But, I don't have any rational argument to oppose it. Here are a few other things to consider   Uber is not a monopoly, and there are other transportation options. If price is surging then everyone has the option of using something else. If Uber is surging I immediately check Ola or TFS. Most of the time Ola is also surging or they dont have cabs available. If they dont have cabs then I look for Ola Auto as a fallback. If the demand doesnt drop in spite of steep surge, then doesn't it mean that Uber is actually the only one being still able to provide cabs and that plenty of people need that ride desperately enough to book at inflated prices?"

Also this is a new one, why should the law of demand and supply be imposed when there is a supply side constraint? The usual solution for increased demand for say...cabs used to be, get more cabs on the road. Here it seems to be price whatever the fuck you feel like and wait for the demand to go away.  edit - /u/denzil_correa came up with this more articulate explanation for why Uber is not being transparent.

It is pretty easy to see with multiple links that online price discrimination is a reality. Also, we don't know WHY these prices are discriminatory. It could be due to many reasons - acceptable or not. We, as customers, should know these reasons.  This isn't about Uber but a question of transparency."

india,3e1vyh,gumnaam20,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:01:19 2015 UTC,"You check the fare and availability on Uber from the comfort of wherever you are before you leave. So if you don't like the price or if its not available, it doesn't bother you as much. Its a very different feeling when you are standing in the rain and trying to flag down an auto/taxi. Your level of desperation and irritation is much higher in that case.  Secondly, there is a sense with Uber/Meru/Ola that the rules are the same for everyone. Its not ""personal"". Surge pricing applies to everybody who is booking a taxi from that location. I'm not being fleeced based on whether I'm wearing a suit vs. jeans or based on how desperate I look.  Thirdly, there is a sense with Uber/Meru/Ola that the rules are same for all the cabbies. You pay the same Surge price irrespective of which cab/cab driver gets assigned to you. You are not left feeling that if I had tried the next auto guy he might have come for less.  Fourthly, even with a higher fare, there is no flat out ""refusal"". A lot of the time when I've wanted to take a black and yellow Auto (esp. from locations like BKC and for relatively short distances) I've been flatly refused. No discussion...no alternate fare being quoted...just NO.  I understand that a lot of these are psychological differences from a consumers point of view but eventually these are in fact the reasons why we get pissed off at Autos overcharging/refusing but are relatively ok with Uber surge pricing."

We did have this conversation before, and to me, ethically and morally this is all fleecing. To justify one (not saying you are, but others for sure are) and call out the other is just hypocrisy.   Fourthly, even with a higher fare, there is no flat out ""refusal"". A lot of the time when I've wanted to take a black and yellow Auto (esp. from locations like BKC and for relatively short distances) I've been flatly refused. No discussion...no alternate fare being quoted...just NO.   Might just be my bad luck, but it has happened to me twice with Uber (never booked them again). The cab was assigned, the cab driver flat out refused. I did write an email to Uber, but only got the generic, your feedback is valuable blah blah."

If they modernize and embrace technology - tie up with an app developer so that people can call Auto's using their smartphones. Make pricing more transparent (displayed in the App) etc. then I suspect they have a shot.   Otherwise, they will be left far behind in the race. They will be the next Kodak."

The Uber's and Ola's can and will never scale up to the level of your autos and cabs (volumes and numbers) and are abusing their 'niche' position imo.  Mind you I have no issue with any of them (and to be honest I haven't taken public transport in fuck knows how many years), but what irks me is the inherent hypocrisy in supporting these guys when they charge Rs 4k when it rains, while shitting on the poor auto rickshaw guy when he charges Rs 150 extra in the same rains.  Mind you, I am seeing this annoyance with Uber almost everywhere I go, and the complaints are the same, that they are breaking laws, or not adhering to local laws. Predatory pricing to capture the market etc etc.  Here is one such, I had a fun time reading it as similar issues are faced by Uber in France.  I hope you agree, shit like predatory pricing, fleecing (no, I refuse to call it Surge pricing) are all ethical no-no's."

This is a highly unfortunate situation. I've always supported autos in this regard. People somehow think that they don't have the right to charge higher amounts come rain or sunshine. Apparently, the poor aren't part of free market economics (which they aren't because of legislations, I believe, but I think they should be)  But reg Uber, I have not, to this day, seen a single person take a cab at (>1.5x). And they are willing to pay that because it still miraculously turns out cheaper than autos not to mention the hassle of going outside and bargaining with one. It's all economics in the end. If you're not my preferred service, I'm going to think twice about paying you any money at all."

Its exactly what you said...the convenience of an air conditioned ride in a nice clean vehicle and avoiding the hassle of bargaining with a black and yellow cab driver / begging 3 guys to ""please take me"" is more than worth it.  Transparency is the key. I don't want to hail a black and yellow cab and request him to take me to which he says no. I want a guaranteed service where when I step out of my office, there is a vehicle waiting for me. For that, even at 2-2.5X, I'd still take Uber (although I would think twice about paying that price all the time)...once in a while I don't mind.  Its also a question of good will and brand equity. I've had enough good experience riding with Uber that I don't mind when they ""cash in"" to that equity and charge me extra every now and then. OTOH Black and Yellow have zero or negative brand equity with most people so it really galls when they try to charge extra. Basic concept of branding....your consumers will forgive you if you are trusted brand with a lot of equity. If people anyway don't think much of you to start with, they aren't going to put up with you when you charge extra.  Eventually black and yellow cabs have to realize that they are in a competitive market. They need to compete either through their prices or by upgrading their services else they won't have a lot of customers left."

They will cry to the government and start attacking Uber just like the French cab drivers did. And even the French admit that those previous cab drivers sucked. I don't blame the cab guys though. They don't have any monetary backing that the Uber drivers enjoy and they probably earn hardly anything at the end of the month (while Uber guarantees a Rs.90k salary to cab drivers ... more than I earn out of college).

india,3e1vyh,Spectronic,-10,Tue Jul 21 11:32:20 2015 UTC,"The difference is that Uber gives you a fair estimate of the fare of your journey BEFORE you book a car. If you don't wish to pay that much, you could take a taxi or an auto, whichever is cheaper.  The autowallah cannot and should not charge you more because he's obliged to only follow the fare shown on the meter. If he asks you for more, you could complain to the traffic police.

The same trip with Uber would have cost 50 bucks or so."
india,3e1vyh,cheesz,-11,Tue Jul 21 12:38:50 2015 UTC,Auto drivers have to follow the rules that the state government has set in place. The government regulates the price.

india,3e1hwk,dumbodropswords,6,Tue Jul 21 08:26:43 2015 UTC,"Its long overdue. This should have happened decades back.    No one really is poor in the Land Owning Apple Belt of HP. And those who hold illegal and encroached land are in majority of the time all Multi-crorepati's.    Most of the encroachment happened decades back. Pristine forest were cut down to make way for cash crop trees like Apple.    Which is why i have 0 sympathy for these owners. In fact i am more disappointed that this will not touch everyone. It will only be done to a few and may not be successful in the final run, but i hope to be proven wrong and let the authorities do its thing before I and others make a final conclusion on this.    And the crop being culled at the time of Crop-Season is immaterial and not a big deal. Law decides a date according to its own bureaucratic procedures and gets to action. Most of these places aren't even properly accessible in Winter.  Neither is the issue of lack of flora an argument against this. Vegetation takes over quite quickly in this region. Apple trees are seasonal, as in they don't even have leaves for a large part of the year. A lot of effort goes into its upkeep. There will be no ecological disaster if these extra crop was culled even if this was made permanent for ever(in which case i hope the authorities reforest the land with indigenous and adjacent forest plant varieties, though it might happen naturally if given enough time).   Himachal has some of the toughest Forest Law Implementation in the entire country. You can't even cut a wild variety trees (which are usually found in forest usually) even if its on your own legal land, you have to take permission from the local Forest Department office. There are regular surprise inspections even in places which are not really illegal hotbeds.    This was not always the case, its a recent development, in the last 5-10 years.    Yes, illegal cutting still happens and quite a bit of forest wood gets smuggled into other states but this has come down due to these strict implementations in recent years. This will never cease entirely but it can be managed.    HP is a leader in environment laws and practise in India. Its not perfect but its better than the rest."

The fact that HP HC has ordered this means that democracy is functional and vibrant.  Second, the fact remains that the land was encroached. Regardless of who did it or for what purpose or for how long, you can't just squat public land, much less forest land, and be allowed to get away with it.  Third, these pictures show anything but ""full grown trees"". More like a few years old, and if indigenous varieties are planted in their place the afforestation will be much faster. As it is, like in this picture the forest looks like it's already reclaiming its space.  Lastly, let's not kid ourselves. The fruit is only going to be harvested by some local strongmen and sold at huge profits with no investment of any sort, hurting locals who do this in a legitimate fashion, putting in hard work, land, and capital. Who is willing to bet that the ""poverty stricken cultivators"" are just cheap imported itinerant laborers who get paid shit.   The BJP government had called for all the farmers and agrarian associations to come ahead and help in regularize cultivation of apples on encroached forest land. Lakhs of people had come ahead with affidavits. However, it appears to be a trap to identify encroached land. In a way, the government tricked apple growers.   Damn right. These are the illegitimate, land squatting, profiteers who shouldn't have been there in the first place. Besides, I am willing to bet the BJP would have been easily bribed, like any other political party, into regularizing these encroachers. Thank Cthulhu for Indian judiciary!"

The scale of illegal deforestation and logging there is unbelievable. Thick forests that I recall from my childhood have disappeared into literally bare hills, and this is happening across the state. Erosion, landslides and their by-product - flooding - are rampant.  If a few thousand apple trees are the sacrifice to fixing this once and for all, then so be it, kudos to the HP govt."

They had already wasted taxpayers money by sending employees to do the hatchet job. That way the people who did the encroachment would have learned their lesson and free apples for the govt. employees. Plus the trees would have been saved. And on a different note I am happy and shocked to see a local news on reddit."
india,3e1hwk,aksh_ad14,2,Tue Jul 21 06:10:35 2015 UTC,after HP High Court’s direction to free the land   Does the HP government even have a choice in this matter?
