RivalsOfAether,3dikqy,Scala_is_so_fly,2,Sat Jul 18 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of moves are single hitboxes that don't change over time. Generally moves work much more simply than in melee.  There are a few attacks with multiple hitboxes over time, such as Forsburn's dair - the first frame with a hit on the front that sends out, and next frame a hit on the back that sends down. And moves like Zetterburns' upair have true sweetspots, with a smaller hitbox laid on top of the larger flub box, so some moves have multiple hitboxes on one frame as well.  I'm actually not sure if there's an example of a sex kick that has the same hitbox but weakens over time; obviously Wrastor's nair is a sex kick style move but I'm not sure if it weakens."

Learn the fundamentals of competitive smash (unless you already know them) then focus on the main Rivals of Aether differences i.e. How you recover, the way wall jumps work, and character play styles/weaknesses. Learning what your main's tools are and how it handles match ups against the rest of the cast will also be very useful. Other than that, practice (preferably with a person, not a CPU), discuss/think out strategies and combos, and practicing ATs and their uses will help for high level play (if you would even call it that) for now, the meta is REALLY young so your only resources are gameplay videos and what carries over from smash.

RivalsOfAether,3d3i5o,jam1garner,3,Mon Jul 13 06:40:18 2015 UTC,"I was glad to see impressive play from all characters during the tournament. However, this Forsburn player proved how the current neutral special is useless, or at least that the benefit of combustion outweighs the stealth option. Perhaps stealth won't be able to have a strong role in this game, which is ok. But I don't think its a good thing to tie up two of his specials to his combustion attack. Perhaps the combustion could be changed to a charged move (like DK punch or charge beam) to make it independent of the smoke?"
RivalsOfAether,3d3i5o,Epiphany_Toilet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:06:06 2015 UTC,"Or maybe when in smoke, the same move that puts out the stove sucks it up. That would keep the feel of the move without needing 2 buttons"
RivalsOfAether,3d3i5o,d4nace,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:59:44 2015 UTC,"Well the problem I see isn't the buttons as much as the feeling of two special attacks function as one.   The smoke and combust combo seems to have the intent of providing an offensive use of the smoke. However, since this game is offensively focused, the deceptive use of smoke is far outweighed by the combustion move, essentially taking away the choice from the player. No one uses the teleport movement option in smoke for this purpose.  To fix this problem, I think combust needs to not remove smoke to work. But, perhaps be enhanced by smoke. This would give more incentive to move amongst your smoke clouds and keep them on the field.   I don't like being prescriptive, especially since I'm not a game designer. But here is an example of what I mean: Down special works as a charge move, like charge beam for samus in smash. It charges slowly, unless you charge while hidden by your smoke, which charges it faster. This would encourage players to teleport from cloud to cloud to hide and charge the attack quickly. It also allows for mixups: imagine a player diving in to disrupt your charge, but you never were charging, and were actually waiting to parry or start a combo."
RivalsOfAether,3d3i5o,Epiphany_Toilet,2,Mon Jul 13 16:17:55 2015 UTC,I think there are some strategies and optimizations that can be done with smoke that we weren't seeing yet. Check out Trevor's matches on that VOD to see how Forsburn can use smoke even when playing to win. :)  Also the design goal is that you are passing up on deception if you are sitting on the charge. In that you give up your ability to hide in order to have the powerful blast.
RivalsOfAether,3d3i5o,jam1garner,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:46:32 2015 UTC,"I suppose I'm jumping the gun when the game is still so young, with limited players learning characters yet. I voiced my concern because I interested in using his ability to hide, but worry that the choice won't work when ""playing to win."" I trust you that I need to be patient and see what develops! :) that development has certainly happened for other characters; I was particularly happy to see some aggressive play from a krag with an approaches I hadn't seen before."

A few moves, like D-Air and D-Tilt, involve her biting to attack. Many moves were also inspired by both Bowser and Charizard, with a bit of inspiration from the Pokemon Ampharos."

RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,lucaspucassix,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:03:47 2015 UTC,"Alright, I think this is also a pretty cool concept. I like that you included possible ideas for her tilts, aerials, and smashes, as well as your inspirations. So, for your design, how would Tortesla play? Would she be a quicker, lighter character? Or would she be a larger, harder-hitting bruiser? Also, do you have an idea as to how her element would be used in her special moves?"
RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,jam1garner,2,Tue Jul 14 17:36:31 2015 UTC,"Specials  Tortesla's Specials mostly revolve around magnetism. Her Standard Special is Friction Beam, a chargeable electric projectile, similar to Samus' Charge Shot or Robin's Thunder. Side Special, Repel, is a windbox-oriented gimping move like Mario's FLUDD, but with much shorter range and less endlag, and it can't be charged. Down Special, Shell Shock, is similar to Bowser Bomb, but faster, slightly weaker, and it pulls foes into the target underneath Tortesla. Her Up Special is Gale Leap, which is a high jump that can be turned. Players near her will be pulled up with her and damaged, keeping them in hitstun. It doesn't put Tortesla into freefall, allowing her to follow up with an attack.  She won't be that slow, maybe between Orcane and Kragg. She'll have a relatively high short hop, since her aerials will be a bit laggy, and her air speed will be medium-slow. She'll hit hard, fall fast and last long, like Bowser, since she's a heavy character, but that comes at the cost of some speed."
RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,squaretilla,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:52:55 2015 UTC,"For the Side Special, Repel, will it be very similar to the F.L.U.D.D. in that it would only push them back, and not turn them around (similar to Mario's cape)? Would it interact with the other characters' projectiles in any way? (I ask because the sketch reminds me of Mewtwo's Side-Special, which does reflect projectiles.)  For Shell Shock, what would be the cause for opponents being pulled underneath Tortesla? Would there be a first hit when she leaps that sends them under? Or would there be a magnetic field under her that pulls nearby opponents in?  As for her Friction Beam, will there only be three different charge states (none, middle, full)? Also, about how long of a range would each charge have?  And lastly, for Gale Leap, I just want to make sure I'm understanding how the move functions. From what I read, it seems similar to Lucario's Up Special from Brawl and Project M, but you are actionable afterwards. Is that how it works? Or is it similar to something like King Dedede's Up-Special?"
RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,jam1garner,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:28:53 2015 UTC,"I thought about having Repel turn players around, but I decided against it since it didn't seem right. It would just push them back with the windbox properties of FLUDD. Yes, it does reflect projectiles, and it sends them back faster and more powerful.  Shell Shock does magnetically pull opponents in from underneath. From the ground, it begins with a headbutt with set knockback that hits foes into the magnetic field.   Friction Beam has 3 levels. The first is a low-damaging electric ball with low range. The middle is a heavier ball with higher range and more damage. The third stage is a full beam like Robin's Thoron.  Gale Leap would be slower than Extreme Speed, but it travels further and it takes wider turns. It also would have drastically shorter startup. I originally planned to have it be more similar to Super Dedede Jump, but since I already had Shell Shock I thought it would be redundant."

RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,PKFireYosh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:03:47 2015 UTC,"True. But since the air character is all but finished, Tortesla's only hope is DLC or modding, which Dan expressed interest in adding possibly after full release."

RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,squaretilla,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:17:06 2015 UTC,Got it.
RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,redtoasti,3,Mon Jul 13 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking she (that's what we decided on, right?) could be a lightweight and representative of the Air element. In my design, she has metal poles on her shell which can conduct electricity, leading to possibly a good idea for up-smash. She can also control her thunder through her flippers and her mouth. What do you think?"
RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,PKFireYosh,2,Sun Jul 12 21:14:24 2015 UTC,"Definitely possible. Honestly, we could also argue for her/him (the vote's even as of me typing this) being a heavyweight too, as they are a tortoise/turtle. It really depends on how we want the character to function."

RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,jam1garner,3,Sun Jul 12 21:36:11 2015 UTC,I really like the idea. You are braver than most of us for drawing it almost right away.
RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,PKFireYosh,2,Sun Jul 12 21:57:48 2015 UTC,Thanks. :P I just wanted to get my thoughts out as quick as possible. The things on her feet are these weird toeless socks with holes in them. My favorite part is the designs on her flippers and head. <3
RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,jam1garner,2,Sun Jul 12 22:06:38 2015 UTC,"So if we have a lighting turtle, the obvious thing to say is that its shell should make it phase through its enemies..."
RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,thestoopkiddd,2,Sun Jul 12 20:50:04 2015 UTC,Maybe like Fox's side B?
RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,thestoopkiddd,2,Sun Jul 12 21:37:07 2015 UTC,Hell yeah
RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,noahk777,2,Sun Jul 12 21:45:12 2015 UTC,That'd be pretty cool. It could also kinda be like Pikachu's up-b where you can angel it..?
RivalsOfAether,3d1skd,noahk777,2,Sun Jul 12 21:47:34 2015 UTC,"To me, that seems a little too lenient if you compare it to the rest of the cast, but still a pretty cool idea."

RivalsOfAether,3cwcwb,Zilby,3,Sat Jul 11 09:31:26 2015 UTC,The Alpha is sent out in monthly/bimonthly waves. You'll have to wait until a new version will be sent out. Though I think there won't be a real next version and instead early access. Might be wrong though.
RivalsOfAether,3cwcwb,Cirby64,5,Sat Jul 11 10:10:27 2015 UTC,"Yup. This is an accurate description of where we currently are at. As we get closer to August, our next build will probably be on Steam and likely take the form of Early Access.  We have playtesters on the June Build but I have been able to get enough balance / bug feedback with the players we have in that grouping so haven't had the need to expand."

RivalsOfAether,3ckz0l,_Darko,7,Wed Jul 8 18:49:28 2015 UTC,"I second the motion! It would be really fun. Although there's not a great spot on the current display scheme to communicate this clearly, either in character select or during the battle."
RivalsOfAether,3ckz0l,TheSkedaddle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:19:38 2015 UTC,"PM has this, the way they did it was any character you click on before you hit start is a character with a chance of being picked."

RivalsOfAether,3ckz0l,Eradication0,3,Wed Jul 8 20:57:51 2015 UTC,"Crew battle mode would be awesome, although I don't think any crews really exist right now"
RivalsOfAether,3ckz0l,JekyllMD,3,Thu Jul 9 09:31:49 2015 UTC,I like this idea. Dan's always open to catering to the competitive community for the game so it's always a possibility that this could get added in the future. I'll mention it to him.

RivalsOfAether,3ckz0l,DrKnockOut99,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:24:36 2015 UTC,"A nice way to implement this would be with the Custom Colors that were an option before - you could create a color set that matches for all of the characters (for instance a purple-gold color scheme to apply to all of your Rivals) then pick the order in which you want your Rivals selected. For instance, you could set a 4 stock match and choose Forsburn, Orcane, Maypul, Zetterburn in that order and have you switch between them in that order every time you respawn, as opposed to it being in a set order based on the CSS like in PM. Plus, that could allow for a nice competitive meta in which you have to understand multiple characters to stand a chance - and not just multiple characters per set, but multiple per match.  It'd get even more insane if you could change the timing of the switch - 2 Zetterburn stocks, one Forsburn and one back to Zetter for instance."
RivalsOfAether,3cfem0,ijames428,6,Tue Jul 7 14:15:28 2015 UTC,"Everything sounds great. I just really hope they'll find a way to have a more lagless online four player experience, instead of just cutting it all together.  Another idea would be to have a king of the hill mode, where the other players could at least spectate the current match.   Just still really hoping four players four different PC's will be a thing."
RivalsOfAether,3cfem0,Cirby64,4,Wed Jul 8 05:42:48 2015 UTC,"Just in case, for whatever reason, you can't go to smashboards or just don't want to, here's the text: @Chuck Tatum   Hmm interesting feedback on the rock. I do think it is one of the strongest projectiles in the game, but where it is now compared to where it was in Kragg's first build is pretty different. (It's been nerfed in multiple ways) That's because the rock was such a pain to deal with. I don't want Kragg using it as a crutch. That's not fun to watch or fight against a spammy Kragg. However, I do want it to feel strong as the special is core to his moveset.   I can say right now that Kragg struggles against parries. This much is clear. I'm not sure if giving him an unparry-able move is wise but I have tossed around the thought of making Down Special not able to be parried. I have also thought about what other options he could have and what could be sped up to help against opponents who have their parry timing down. Still haven't landed on something solid that sticks to the character design.  @someonetookjacob  Yup agreed on a lot of your stuff. The clone not being broken is indeed a bug due to the exact reason you state. Was tracking knockback hitstun only not stationary hitstun. I actually just fixed that tonight. That being said, we have some ideas for changing up the Forsburn clone that we are looking at. I'm still not 100% into its design in terms of deception and combo potential.  Also I found a bug causing crashes with Maypul in the previous update. I have uploaded a fix today that playtesters can redownload by visiting the same link. It has these changes from last time: Fixed bug with Maypul seeds causing a crash in matches with 3+ players. (Animation division by 0) Fixed bug where Forsburn clone was getting wrapped instead of destroyed. Lowered Maypul seed damage from 2 -> 1. Nerf them seeds!  Also sorry I have been a bit afk from the boards. We have been making a ton of progress behind the scenes. Here are some of the highlights from the past 2 weeks: We got greenlit in 5 days. It was crazy. Thanks a ton for all the support and sharing our tweet / greenlight page. We are looking into the Steam process now. Tons of Online progress has been made. I have been playing matches against Ryan. No more desyncs in any matchup at the moment! Online is looking like 1v1 initially. We can add 2v2 support with 2 local vs 2 more local but because of lag concerns we might only support 2 pc/consoles hooked up. We'll have more information on that later. Online menu progress has begun. You can use custom controls, player tags, and colors in online matches now (was just basic stuff before) Char 7 is playable and in polish stages. I have been playing as 7 a good amount to figure out combo potential. Char 8 is through concept/design stages. We are in animation stage. Ellian is really knocking this one out of the park. His work on Char 7 is pretty amazing too. We got rejected from the EVO 2015 Indie Showcase sadly. They are full up on games :(. I will NOT be attending EVO now. Too expensive to go to just hang out. However, I am trying to organize a Rivals of Aether invitational as a side event. If any playtesters are attending EVO this year then please message me (@danfornace) and @AZProjectMelee on twitter or reply to this thread and let me know if you would be interested in being on the list / list of substitutes for the invitational. Trevor has been working on single player content. It's going really well. Lots to do though and he has been creating some fun stuff that I'm sure players will enjoy later this year. We are gearing up for Super Smash Con. If you are attending, we are planning to be there with a booth showing Rivals. We also hope to do a side tournament. Hopefully we'll have a bit of swag for winners / fans as well. If you want to get insider information on Rivals development then plan to be there in August. That's all for now. I'll drop in and share some more information as we get it.  -Dan"

RivalsOfAether,3cfylq,AnAnonymousSmasher,2,Wed Jul 8 07:03:51 2015 UTC,"The button layout can be changed in the options menu to just using just one attack button, but I like the two button layout. Maybe it's because I'm left handed, but I honestly don't see why it would be hard for you to switch hands. On the running part, you can also double tap to run which is what I do. Or you can take the easy route and hook up a Gamecube controller like me. I have an off brand USB Gamecube controller that works awesome with the game. Of course, this game is made for Xbone controllers, but I don't find any major issues with them (besides not being Gamecube controllers)."

RivalsOfAether,3cfylq,ijames428,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:52:09 2015 UTC,"It is worth noting that the Dev is sort of ignoring the keyboard controls for now, and has said he doesnt want feedback about them from playtesters for now, which I think means he knows they aren't there yet and just hasnt had the time to focus on them? The game is still in alpha.  So I am pretty sure they will be changed (and improved) before full release."

Alright, so I have a couple questions:  -Is there a prominent idea for how online is going to work for both ranked and casual matches? For instance, will there be a system where there are player-made rooms that people can join like they did in Smash 4? And will there be separate modes for ranked and casual online matches?  -Are there plans to adjust the original 4 characters' parry animations to be on a similar visual quality to Maypul's and Forsburn's parries?  -Are there plans for custom color options for the characters, or other cosmetically-oriented features? (I'd heard about it somewhere and thought it would be cool, I'd like to hear your thoughts.)  -What are the methods for examining hitboxes/frame data? For example, is there a mode where you put in actions frame-by-frame, or is there just a slower-FPS mode?  -What characters do you think have a lot of competitive potential? (I think they all do, but I'm asking which do you think have a bit more than the others.)  Lastly,  -Which non-Zetterburn character is your favorite both to play and overall? (I'd ask which character in general was your favorite, but we all know how that would end..."

RivalsOfAether,3bn2f6,patwag,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:03:42 2015 UTC,hey just wondering why you limit the testing? Is it because you don't want to be swarmed with emails from people who don't know what they are talking about? all i want is to experience the game and I'm getting inpatient!!!
RivalsOfAether,3bn2f6,d4nace,3,Wed Jul 1 03:38:19 2015 UTC,I can't keep track of all the feedback I would get so opening it up a ton wouldn't help a ton. Also each person who gets a playtester build increases the chance of it being spread and I don't really want an old copy floating around the internet when the full game is out.
RivalsOfAether,3bn2f6,patwag,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:12:58 2015 UTC,"the earlier you bring it to early access on steam the better then, if you do the old copies floating around (which is inevitable) will be far too old and far from the final product, if anything the old copy will make you more sales as people will be able to try the game for free but will be unable to access all features of the game."

RivalsOfAether,3bnkqz,jtthebomb,3,Wed Jul 1 15:24:23 2015 UTC,East Coast to West Coast. Feels really good. Pretty much the same as playing local.  I have also played against Trevor who doesn't have the greatest internet. That doesn't quite feel like local play because of the lag. It is playable though. Until we get a disconnect when it hangs for too long. Working through that now.
RivalsOfAether,3bnkqz,d4nace,3,Wed Jul 1 20:15:30 2015 UTC,Great to hear! The online is probably the biggest feature for an indie game like this (other than gameplay) so I'm glad it's going well.

RivalsOfAether,3bnkqz,ijames428,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:36:04 2015 UTC,Does Steam have anything to say about when you can do early access or is that totally up to you?
RivalsOfAether,3bnkqz,Skroyan,2,Thu Jul 2 01:22:21 2015 UTC,"How do you plan to handle the online netcode? Will it be good to play between far countries (like USA vs Brazil, USA vs Germany, Netherlands vs Argentina, etc.) already in the Early Access?   Brawlhalla (another new brawler with potential) is doing a great job in the netcode to be good to play between far countries, I think something like that (or even better if you know how to do it) is definitely the way to go, to have worldwide matchmaking and good ways to play with friends in customs. It uses a rollback system."
RivalsOfAether,3bnkqz,Cirby64,3,Wed Jul 1 14:06:22 2015 UTC,"From personal experience, I can say that Brawlhalla's online system is less than optimal over long distances. I frequently play with people from Germany, and when we tried out that game people were teleporting all over the place. It seems to favor tight controls over accuracy in online play, which is fine and dandy when you play with people that are close by, but no matter how responsive my controls are, if the other people teleport around, it's not gonna work."
RivalsOfAether,3bnkqz,Skroyan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:55:57 2015 UTC,"Not really... at least that's not what happens most of the time, with most people. Me and my clan (the majority of players live in USA) play very fine against people from USA and Europe in general, and I live in Brazil. We extensively played in all the patches during the development of the game, and we can say that the teleporting is not a frequent issue. There are minor rollbacks sometimes (more against Europe players), but no teleporting. The only times when there is teleporting is when the servers are with some kind of problem, and as soon as they are noted they are solved in a few days at most. Your experience is the exception, not the rule.  If there is a better way than that type of netcode, sure, that would be even more awesome. I just wish that there is fair and viable matches between far countries. I'm mentioning Brawlhalla because from my experience with other other games online that require precise timing (mostly Chivalry: Medieval Warfare and Blade Symphony), Brawlhalla is vastly better. These two games I said are really bad to play with higher pings (150 vs 20~50 for example), like being comboed by the wind and being hitted by attacks you parried in your own screen."
RivalsOfAether,3bnkqz,Cirby64,2,Fri Jul 3 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"Skullgirls for example uses GGPO which relies on setting a frame buffer to your controls. This favors visual accuracy instead of responsiveness, and is definitely the way to go with fighting games imo. Just research the skullgirls online vs mode, it's praised as one of the best if not, the best for any fighting game."
RivalsOfAether,3bnkqz,Skroyan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:32:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, GGPO system is great. The rollback system of Brawlhalla is very similar to it, in fact. The teleporting is not a part of the intended working of the online play. As I said, if it was happening, it's because of some kind of issue that can be solved, not what normally happens.  Well, whatever works the best, I'm looking forward to it! :)"

RivalsOfAether,3bhnlc,someonetookjacob,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:21:23 2015 UTC,One thing I like to try to do to disrespect with Kragg is as follows. 1)Spike enemy off stage with d-air 2)Up-b to create a pillar saving your enemy and bringing them back up to you. 3)Kill them. f-air is probably a good choice. But if they are DI-ing hard in you might be able to get a second down-air.  (basically anything relies on them not reacting to it fast enough though)

RivalsOfAether,3bevza,AbsolutelyCone,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:04:35 2015 UTC,"One controller per adapter (although x360 might actually fix that, looking into that is on my to do list) and making all kinds of adjustments to the analog sticks.   And, depending on your adapter, possibly also the buttons and even more on the sticks.   Update, two controllers per adapter works super easily, actually. I should have realized that earlier"

RivalsOfAether,3b8uqd,_Darko,6,Fri Jun 26 22:27:34 2015 UTC,"Heyo. Thanks for the UI suggestions. We have had plans to try to get dodge and djump into the player's hover HUD. However, because of profile tags, its a little difficult to make it work cleanly unless we do 2 elements, the tag and then another bar or something underneath that shows those elements. We also run the risk of it being quite ugly.  In terms of damage, we will be working on making that a bit more clear. Possibly even a display option for damage like RPG systems that floats above the hit :). We do actually have a dark outline appear around your player number or tag when you reach 100% or more to help that stand out. We will look into more HUD options this summer for sure.  Thanks!"
RivalsOfAether,3b8uqd,d4nace,2,Fri Jun 26 23:38:20 2015 UTC,Floating damage numbers would be sick and a great way to differentiate stylistically from other fighters!
RivalsOfAether,3b8uqd,LifeSmash,2,Fri Jun 26 23:47:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I love how much you interact with us. I also have one more question/suggestion. I know when you land it automatically techs, you can tech left or right or just leave it to tech in place. If you leave it to tech in place do you get invincibility? My suggestion was you only get the invincibility if you actually click the button to tech it"
RivalsOfAether,3b8uqd,d4nace,6,Sat Jun 27 00:53:20 2015 UTC,"Nah its not automatic. You have to time the tech to get invince. The diff in Rivals is that sometimes not teching is okay too as it is a quick land state with no invincibility. So if someone is on top of you then tech, if they might take a bit to get to you then don't tech.  We basically tried to make don't tech an option. It's plays decent. I need some more high level play to know if I like it how it is."

RivalsOfAether,3akahs,Cirby64,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:45:57 2015 UTC,Irony: Lightning is slow. The Lightning person turns out he is slow.  I would love a character with lots of set up options. Maybe like villager. But lightning mechanics could be like pikachu but with mostly stun (I think there is a custom like this) or ZSS style moves.  Edit: wording.  Edit 2: more info.

RivalsOfAether,3a7a4g,AC_Merchant,2,Fri Jun 19 18:08:41 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, nobody streams ""regularly"" since there's no online multiplayer yet, so streaming vs CPU gets old after a bit, trust me there.

RivalsOfAether,3a4rmw,Over9000BaconPerHour,3,Wed Jun 17 05:40:28 2015 UTC,"My first impression: ""Wow, her combos are amazing and she has little difficulty smashing. Her speed is his but her specials are forgiving. What's her weakness?"" I'm still wondering what her main wekaness is, but the beauty of her design is that when you play against her (I've only done bots so far, but tomorrow I'll have my group test), she doesn't seem overly powerful. I'll try to pinpoint what her exact weakness is if no one else finds it.  I really like her design. Her smashes are familiar, so she's easy to pick up, but her specials really shine. I haven't figured out which onstage play-style is better (offensive vs. defensive) but it seems she's well rounded.   Her recovery is probably the most modest in the game. Without her Watcher's Mark, she has to think about how she will recover, but even then she's not helpless, and she has the ability to mix things up. For instance, if you get a walljump opportunity, you can hold onto the wall for a variable duration. Also, her up-special isn't useless without her mark being active (like orcane), it's just a lot weaker. So overall, recovering is solid, but not overpowered. Great job, Dan.     So, what do you guys think of Maypul overall?  Is she your new main? Why or why not?   Do you think she's offensive or defensive?  How do you use her plants and seeds?"
RivalsOfAether,3a4rmw,VROOM99,2,Wed Jun 17 05:54:13 2015 UTC,She's FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAST! I can agree with the recovery. I feel like the strongs might be a tad too long.   I'll probably be testing with a group of decent smash players later today (wednesday) and I'll see how that goes. Then on Thursday I'll definitely be testing again with one more person.
RivalsOfAether,3a4rmw,VROOM99,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:27:50 2015 UTC,"So, you think she needs a buff?"
RivalsOfAether,3a4rmw,waffletron48,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:28:44 2015 UTC,Not at all. So far I'd want to nerf her strong range if anything. But I don't have enough time with the game to warrant any nerfs or buffs.
RivalsOfAether,3a4rmw,slendermax,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:28:17 2015 UTC,Yeah my first impression was that shes more nerf-worthy. We'll see if that opinion persists with more play
RivalsOfAether,3a4rmw,waffletron48,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:31:42 2015 UTC,I feel her down special doesn't do enough. Perhaps making it mark opponents when they walk over it if they aren't already marked and snaring them if they are marked? Just an idea but I find the current version to not be that impacting.
RivalsOfAether,3a4rmw,slendermax,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:55:31 2015 UTC,It's definitely better for stage control late in someone's stock.
RivalsOfAether,3a4rmw,Edgekid,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:03:36 2015 UTC,I guess but I feel when percents are low another way to tag them would be nice.

RivalsOfAether,3a1pue,ijames428,2,Tue Jun 16 15:30:19 2015 UTC,Watcher's Mark lasts forever until you consume it.  The tie only lasts 20 frames + time for damage. Up to around 1 second at high damage.  The trap stays out for 8 seconds unless you feed it 5 seeds then it gets fat and sits there until it wraps someone and consumes itself.
RivalsOfAether,3a1pue,ijames428,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:31:56 2015 UTC,"haha, that's awesome about the plant getting fat.  Is the f-air a 45-ish degree downward spike?"

RivalsOfAether,3a1pue,AbsolutelyCone,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:50:02 2015 UTC,"So Maypul's recovery is similar to Orcane's right?  Like, you use the puddle for Orcane and the mark for Maypul?  And they both have a horizontal dash as part of it?"
RivalsOfAether,3a1pue,Over9000BaconPerHour,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:00:07 2015 UTC,Yup. But she has a wall cling too. So she can wall jump more vertically if she wants which helps her get back as long as she can get to a wall.

RivalsOfAether,39oqxh,Over9000BaconPerHour,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:24:30 2015 UTC,"I dont have as much trouble killing with forsburn as most I think, but I also dont main him or anything.  But I like the idea of n-b changing when you have absorbed three smoke.  I think If i could change it however I wanted I might make it work alot like his d-b in knock back and the fact that it used up his smoke charges, but have it be a cone attack infront of him.  Like a breathing fire roar thing.  Give it similar radial knockback as the down-b but much more range.  It still gives him an interesting additional option, but its more different which I like.  Also it would look fucking cool.  You're Idea is probably more balanced, but I am not sure you should be able to do it all you want? that seems a little excessive.  Another idea is to make his down-b work like what you are describing but it only uses one smoke charge.  Then if he gets the full three his n-b is the full burst like his down b used to be.  One last think to note is from the patch notes it looks like his down-b got a pretty decent buff in knockback growth, so maybe that will help some?  (his up-b was also had its knockback growth increased.  Hoping teleport kills become a real thing!)"
RivalsOfAether,39oqxh,someonetookjacob,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:15:50 2015 UTC,"I can understand what you're getting at. I like the idea of only consuming one of the absorbed clouds. Because, I'd really hate to lose the ability to cast more clouds after absorbing three."
RivalsOfAether,39oqxh,Rambonatron,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:35:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't played the game at all, so take my suggestions with a grain of salt.  What I would feel would really play into the unique aspects of Forsburn's identity, would be to give his other abilities some more utility, making them consume the smoke stacks as well. I'm thinking of stuff like his neutral-b being able to expel more smoke at once (while this seems like a waste normally, it shouldn't be that hard to re-stack your smoke back up, making it a nice tool to get more smoke on the field) or your decoy being able to take one or two extra hits.   While these types of changes wouldn't give him more direct killing power, I don't think giving him another heavy hit will increase his killing potential that much more either. From the looks of it (again, I haven't actually been able to play the game, so I'm just judging from what I've seen), the issue is that Forsburn can't really land a big hit, not the fact that he doesn't have enough big hits. A bit more smoke on the field, or a decoy that can occasionally tank an extra hit might lead to some extra setups for a kill or gimp, while increasing his deceptive identity even more.   I'm pretty sure you've already considered giving him more utility though, and decided of a good reason not to do so."

RivalsOfAether,39c5a6,Rambonatron,2,Wed Jun 10 19:44:01 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's a combination of the two. The game is built to facilitate comboing, more so than Smash, but they're not inescapable."
RivalsOfAether,39c5a6,Over9000BaconPerHour,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:45:58 2015 UTC,"To add to what you said, Comboing is definitely easier in RoA (which is on purpose) so you need to have really good DI at a much lower level of play than in smash, but with the right DI and right teching options I think almost everything can be escaped.  That said with a read on the tech or DI there may be ways to continue the combo.    With the addition of directional air dodges you can act out of (something I dont see people taking full advantage of much in videos) and the parry system you should see more combo reversals in RoA than in smash too.   So in conclusion, easier longer combos, more reversals, but combos do require reads (or bad DI) to continue for a long time.  Part of the reason you see only long combos online right now is also probably a biasing effect, people aren't as keen to post their videos unless they did something cool in them."
RivalsOfAether,39c5a6,someonetookjacob,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:28:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess the bias you mentioned has a large part in it too. I'll have to see how it plays I guess. I like the moments in Smash where combos just 'happen'. Rather than having to learn combos like in King of Fighters or Tekken that'll work every single time if you just land the first hit. Stuff like that just increases the skill floor without adding anything meaningful to the actual interaction with your opponent.
RivalsOfAether,39c5a6,AbsolutelyCone,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:13:21 2015 UTC,"There's both more hitstun in RoA and a TON more conditioning into heavy punishing.

RivalsOfAether,392yk3,d4nace,10,Tue Jun 9 03:33:35 2015 UTC,Just kidding. I would love for players to discover tech with characters. As a Sonic Brawl main most of my gameplay was build around ATs. The Rival engine is not quite as deep as melee so I am not sure how many will arise but I would love to see new strategies develop.  The only way I would hit one in an update is if it overcentralized the gameplay. For example if a tech came out that made the Zburn - Orcane matchup 90-10 and made the matchup all about using the tech then I would likely want to remove it as it would be making the game worse not better.

Given the whole point of this game is to basically have a version of Melee that is actually being balanced, while still promoting aggressive pla, rather than defensive play, I feel AT's are gonna be very welcomed and integrated."

RivalsOfAether,38p7xm,Cirby64,3,Fri Jun 5 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"For those that don't get the title - In Melee, Marth has an iconic combo called the 'Ken Combo'. This usually consists of forward-air(s) to down-air, to kill with a powerful spike. In the PAL (European) version of Melee, his down-air was changed to a meteor-smash, which makes it much worse, and pretty much worthless. So the staple combo for PAL regions is forward-air(s) to reverse Up-B."

RivalsOfAether,38p7xm,Over9000BaconPerHour,3,Fri Jun 5 21:36:16 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's intentional. The first hitbox of his Up-Special is the strong one. There doesn't seem to be a set distance you need to be from the target though like with Marth's.
RivalsOfAether,38p7xm,Arctic_SSB,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:46:16 2015 UTC,"I've never played PAL Melee but from the sound of it, it seems overly complicated to have a ""set distance you need to be from the target,"" so I'm glad he left it out."

RivalsOfAether,38norv,VROOM99,2,Fri Jun 5 13:34:44 2015 UTC,The sheer cuteness of this screenshot has convinced to main Orcane when I get access to the build in about 34 years.

RivalsOfAether,38norv,AbsolutelyCone,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:17:56 2015 UTC,Awesome way to balance orcane. Hopefully now Orcane players will be less reliant on bubbles and will be more creative with the rest of his kit!
RivalsOfAether,38ngxe,d4nace,2,Fri Jun 5 10:25:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I think at higher levels of play Zburn is still quite strong in the current build, although the more experience I get with Orcane the more delicious his range (both literal and in terms of stage presence/movement) feels. Wrastor definitely drops off as DI comes into existence, although I feel that Kragg can compete at a higher level by abusing his strengths more and fishing for kills less.  Forsburn is such a weird character I don't even know what to think. I love the disjoints and most of his normals but his specials all feel clunky. Just an odd guy in general."
RivalsOfAether,38ngxe,AbsolutelyCone,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:25:00 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it's that at a high level, Orcane has to work the least to be strong. I have a friend who beats orcane with his ZBurn all the time, but he hates the matchup because he has to read the Orcane so much."
RivalsOfAether,38ngxe,Over9000BaconPerHour,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:42:37 2015 UTC,What about Forsburn? I think he would fall somewhere in-between Kragg and Wrastor and Orcane
RivalsOfAether,38ngxe,Zer01717,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:16:10 2015 UTC,"I see this list develop as well. How you are looking to fix it? Are you thinking of any minor kit changes (Looking at you Kragg), or just going to number tweaks?"
RivalsOfAether,38ngxe,Over9000BaconPerHour,2,Fri Jun 5 15:33:50 2015 UTC,This doesn't really beckon any kit changes really. I think a lot of games have this kind of flow.  Only real take-away from this is to watch Orcane. Zburn is still strong but I think his predictability hurts him.
RivalsOfAether,38ngxe,JekyllMD,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:39:44 2015 UTC,Is this...the first tier list for RoA?
RivalsOfAether,38ngxe,Cirby64,3,Fri Jun 5 18:17:12 2015 UTC,"Not quite. Though in the March Build that went out, I viewed the characters like so:  S: Zetterburn  A: Orcane, Kragg  B: Forsburn, Wrastor   Wrastor has had some slight buffs since then. Forsburn hasn't really but I am still waiting on what I do with his specials. Also Zburn has been tuned down a bit since then in a couple of ways. Orcane has been hit a touch. Kragg has not been nerfed."
RivalsOfAether,38ngxe,Cirby64,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:27:50 2015 UTC,"Yo Wrastor buffs? What are we talking about here, just number tweaks? I thought he was in a really good position, but I'm all for it."
RivalsOfAether,38ngxe,Cirby64,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:42:19 2015 UTC,Down Strong is now a meteor and can be used mid combo in certain cases.  Up Special has a bit of scaling increase. Not too much other than that but that alone makes him feel better imo.
RivalsOfAether,38ngxe,AbsolutelyCone,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"It'll be interesting to see how I can incorporate Down Strong into my gameplay. I've been playing Wrastor for a while, and really only use Up Strong, and Up Special as kill moves."
RivalsOfAether,38ll86,WukongDaMonkey,8,Fri Jun 5 00:29:57 2015 UTC,Mac won't be supported at Launch. But Game Maker Studio supports Mac so I can see us bringing it to Mac post launch.  No idea yet on how much later.

We are still working with the clone, Nspecial and other pieces of the character that could be made more competitive.

RivalsOfAether,381y9l,d4nace,2,Mon Jun 1 08:34:48 2015 UTC,Really looking forward to changes to Forsburn's specials. I love the character's neutral combos but the specials you mentioned are unsatisfying to use for me personally.
RivalsOfAether,381y9l,AbsolutelyCone,3,Mon Jun 1 08:56:37 2015 UTC,"Jesus, 15% less hitstun scaling across the board? I’m... Worried. The hitstun is part of this farms balance, appeal, and design.  Edit: post says .7, not .8. Still concerned but it won’t noticeable until really high percent so eh. I trust 4nace"
RivalsOfAether,381y9l,AbsolutelyCone,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:08:00 2015 UTC,".7 is from an earlier post. .65 is from a more recent post:    ""Hitstun: Yup. The scaling on hitstun time is a bit high. I've hit it in my build. Reduced it a bit further for my playtest today. from .8 - .65."""
RivalsOfAether,381y9l,d4nace,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:17:12 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn’t scroll down far enough. My bad. We’ll see what he does"
RivalsOfAether,381y9l,AbsolutelyCone,3,Mon Jun 1 08:21:05 2015 UTC,It's just on scaling though not on base hitstun. Will only be noticeable on attacks that send really far. Hitstun on attacks at 0 percent will not change at all. Hitstun on attacks that dont scale well (non-kill moves) wont change much at all.  So basically it will be  Hitstun Time = Base knockback * Hitstun Scalar + Damage * Knockback Scaling * Hitstun Scaler * .65 (down from .8).
RivalsOfAether,381y9l,d4nace,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:31:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I’m familiar with the mechanics. I haven’t thought about the effect in depth, that was my knee jerk reaction. Given how distinct low and high kbs moves are in roa I guess it won’t be a big deal.  Also I trust you more than any other dev."
RivalsOfAether,381y9l,GatorFaceV,3,Mon Jun 1 08:37:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I do notice it a bit but it doesnt ruin the feel right now. It means if you knock somebody horizontally the wrong direction then they are less likely to fly all the way to the far blastzone before being able to act.  I need to play some more with the change and friends but I can say it doesn't affect most combos currently.

We are getting close to full content now so this build won't go out to as many players as the March build, but we will be accepting new and old alike again. Mostly new.  This summer though we will be making plans to get it in the hands of more players."
RivalsOfAether,37svc8,Cirby64,3,Sat May 30 02:58:53 2015 UTC,good video because of him I got the games attention
RivalsOfAether,37svc8,Eradication0,3,Sat May 30 08:16:23 2015 UTC,awesome! the vid got 700+ likes!
RivalsOfAether,37tnvq,Eradication0,7,Sat May 30 08:14:06 2015 UTC,Hmm hadn't thought about a free demo but maybe actually. We will be looking to get more players in late Summer. So either a demo or Early Access or maybe both.
RivalsOfAether,37tnvq,d4nace,1 point,Sun May 31 11:39:27 2015 UTC,Yes! Because I can't spend much time to test everything so a demo would be awesome to get the feeling of the game!

RivalsOfAether,36xajn,d4nace,3,Fri May 22 21:54:05 2015 UTC,"The new UI looks nice. Maybe instead of the black, you could use the player color.

RivalsOfAether,36xajn,macj95,5,Sat May 23 01:14:08 2015 UTC,"That was my immediate thought upon seeing the screenshot, but looking at this example, the player colors are waaaaaay too bright for that. Hurts my eyes & can barely read the text :-("
RivalsOfAether,36xajn,solarDerivative,2,Sat May 23 03:06:11 2015 UTC,Better?
RivalsOfAether,36xajn,macj95,3,Sat May 23 05:00:16 2015 UTC,Try just doing the player up top perhaps?
RivalsOfAether,36xajn,horrorslice,4,Sat May 23 05:02:39 2015 UTC,Like this?
RivalsOfAether,36xajn,macj95,3,Sat May 23 05:29:44 2015 UTC,That looks pretty good.
RivalsOfAether,36xajn,solarDerivative,2,Sat May 23 06:17:29 2015 UTC,Yeah! I'm digging that.
RivalsOfAether,36xajn,horrorslice,1 point,Sat May 23 06:19:25 2015 UTC,Pretty cool. Yeah we'll think about something like that. Wouldn't be hard. Maybe the darker player color instead of the brightest though.
RivalsOfAether,36xajn,DMthePerson,1 point,Sun May 24 12:00:34 2015 UTC,Why not just whoever paused?
RivalsOfAether,36xajn,JekyllMD,1 point,Sun May 24 15:30:25 2015 UTC,Yeah it would be the color of who paused but could be the darker color (like the color that is shown after someone is eliminated)
RivalsOfAether,36xajn,JekyllMD,2,Sun May 24 21:14:00 2015 UTC,I tried using a darker red before but the two colors clashed imo. You could probably make it work well though.

RivalsOfAether,36ty7f,d4nace,10,Fri May 22 02:30:41 2015 UTC,"Hard to explain. But the way it is right now is a little jarring don't you think? The shockwave just looks so out of place in this 16 bit like game. If you can somehow make some form of pixelated shockwave or something, I think that might be better. Just my opinion though, still think it looks great!"
RivalsOfAether,36ty7f,Cirby64,6,Fri May 22 03:11:19 2015 UTC,Thank you I thought I was the only one who thought that.
RivalsOfAether,36ty7f,GatorFaceV,1 point,Fri May 22 03:13:43 2015 UTC,"I think pixalating it is a great idea.    It would also be cool if the radius depended on how much you exceeded the shockwave threshold by in knockback.  It might be fun if you had an enemy at high percent and you get a counter, to reeeally charge up your smash to rub in the kill with a huge shockwave.  I still think shockwaves should be a rare thing though.  I think it would be ideal if not even every killing blow caused one, just the really strong ones."
RivalsOfAether,36ty7f,someonetookjacob,3,Fri May 22 15:27:54 2015 UTC,Does it happen often? It looks super good but it might get annoying in combos...
RivalsOfAether,36ty7f,TheMightyDJE,5,Fri May 22 02:37:55 2015 UTC,From the other thread:   Some context.  It only appears if an attack reaches a certain level of knockback power. (Base Knockback + Damage*KnockbackScaling) I can adjust the variable to be something that feels good. It will also only trigger if it is not already triggered (so it will trigger one during powerful trades).  The value currently needs pretty decent power. An up attack from the ground of most stages that triggers this would surely KO. Horizontal attacks will usually KO as long as there is no wall or pillar in the way OR if you do it from the opposite side of the stage.
RivalsOfAether,36ty7f,TheMightyDJE,3,Fri May 22 02:40:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds perfect to me then, sorry didn't see the other one  P.S. game looks awesome can't wait to play it"
RivalsOfAether,36ty7f,GatorFaceV,2,Fri May 22 02:58:06 2015 UTC,Hah s'all good. I figured some would see one or the other :P
RivalsOfAether,36ty7f,solarDerivative,3,Fri May 22 03:02:44 2015 UTC,"Still a little odd, but much better than the huge version. What would it look like smaller though? Or even killing with a multihit; would it look like water ripples?"
RivalsOfAether,36ty7f,GatorFaceV,1 point,Fri May 22 03:13:00 2015 UTC,"Hmmm maybe i can restrict it to the 2x2 grid. Would take some time to figure out. I dont think smaller would help much though.  And no, only attacks that are powerful enough will trigger it, generally multi-hits only have a powerful attack for the final hit."
RivalsOfAether,36ty7f,Leeyawshee,3,Fri May 22 03:15:01 2015 UTC,"Also in regards to the smaller comment, this is not the full window. The size looks nice in-game imo."
RivalsOfAether,36ty7f,Shrafio,2,Fri May 22 03:44:41 2015 UTC,Looking forward to seeing it in-game. Planned for next build?
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,d4nace,9,Thu May 21 23:04:12 2015 UTC,"I LOVE it!  I could see it being a little too distracting if it happened alot (Less is more?).  But right now, having only seen this one gif. I absolutely love it!"
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,someonetookjacob,3,Thu May 21 23:21:22 2015 UTC,Agreed. As long as it isn't something that could happen mid combo (i.e. in rapid succession) this could be awesome. Maybe only on killing blows or something of the sort. Right now though it looks outrageously hype.
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,whatthatgame,7,Thu May 21 23:37:31 2015 UTC,"Yes!! This is once of the things the gameplay needed visually, that ""black lightning"" effect from Smash 4. Would be nice if there was this drastic shockwave effect for finishers and something visually for lesser, but still powerful, blows. Like in Smash 4 the edges of the screen will flash ever so slightly when a strong move hits whether it's ""black-lightning-worthy"" or not, would nice to see a similar form of visual feedback."
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,solarDerivative,5,Thu May 21 23:47:29 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see something like this being developed. So far, the game hasn't appeared nearly as theatrical as Smash.  I remember reading that the ledge grab in Smash 64 was originally designed for such an effect. The goal was to have players feel astonished to make it back sometimes. Other effects, like the cheering crowd, add to this.   This genre of game gives players control over an avatar like no other. It makes sense to amp players up for landing powerful hits or combos, since they work hard to do so."
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,Epiphany_Toilet,3,Fri May 22 02:49:42 2015 UTC,Yeah agreed. Its all about player feedback. But the trick with being so small is being able to balance content and polish since both take a good amount of time to get right.  We want to amp up our hit effects a bit too before release. Too many rely on the standard white burst.
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,Chait-hei,3,Fri May 22 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that looks sick. Great idea"
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,andy98725,3,Fri May 22 00:04:31 2015 UTC,Some context.   It only appears if an attack reaches a certain level of knockback power.

RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,andy98725,1 point,Fri May 22 01:12:53 2015 UTC,"Could this be done similarly to the ""black lightning"" effect from sm4sh? (It only shows up if the move would kill without DI.) This would likely be done by calculating the trajectory of the path for the duration of hitstun (again, assuming no DI) and checking if it ends outside the border."
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,FalconTrash,1 point,Sat May 30 20:38:37 2015 UTC,It's possible but has a lot of edge-cases such as walls and ground that can be created. I can look into it. Right now on just strong enough hits doesn't feel bad.
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,macj95,1 point,Sat May 30 21:42:26 2015 UTC,"Alright. I think Smash handled edge cases like walls by ignoring them, but you can do it however you'd like."
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,Epiphany_Toilet,3,Sat May 30 22:12:22 2015 UTC,Fucking neat
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,seanfidence,4,Fri May 22 10:13:19 2015 UTC,Its a really nice effect but i feel it shouldn't take up the whole screen. Maybe a small area around the impact would look nicer. Other than that i really like the idea.
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,macj95,7,Fri May 22 01:22:18 2015 UTC,Tried a more localized shockwave. I'm thinking its better. Maybe less impactful but will work nicer for free-for-all.  http://gfycat.com/IllustriousRedHarrier
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,Phuegles,3,Fri May 22 02:29:10 2015 UTC,This smaller version looks better to me.
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,GatorFaceV,2,Fri May 22 02:52:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that the smaller version is better, imo, but they both look really awesome!"
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,slendermax,3,Fri May 22 12:56:45 2015 UTC,That's a lot better in my opinion. It will definitely be less distracting during free-for-all's while still keeping the effect of landing the strong hit. Keep up the good work. Looking forward to the release of RoA.
RivalsOfAether,36ta1p,Shrafio,1 point,Fri May 22 02:47:16 2015 UTC,I actually prefer the large one.

RivalsOfAether,36fmlk,d4nace,6,Tue May 19 00:34:00 2015 UTC,"[INCOMPLETE] A few things we learned from this stream!   Abyss Mode (custom mode) will function a little more like sm4sh's equipment as opposed to sm4sh's special moves. Also, you won't be able to play with customs online (probably). Rival #6 will likely have the worst recovery in the game. It's very ""high risk/high reward,"" according to /u/d4ance. If time and/or resources allow, taunts will be added for each character, but it's not a priority. If characters do get taunts, it will be one taunt per character. At this point in time, it is being considered for a stage's Aether Mode to mimic FD, with this same stage's Basic Mode mimicking Battlefield. Speaking of stages' Basic Modes, Merchant Port's Basic Mode no longer has spinning platforms, hallelujah. Instead, it will feature two stationary platforms that are level with each other, but higher than the platforms on the edges of the stage. Its Aether Mode still features both the water pumps and rotating platforms. Treetop Lodge's Aether Mode will probably be shown off around the end of this month, but Rival #6 will only be teased, if that. Rivals of Tether might be added in the future, but it's not a priority and might even be post-launch. The screenshots we saw in the April Fools' update were made to help solidify the joke, they weren't actually gameplay screenshots.      That's all I have off the top of my head! Feel free to mention anything that I didn't.  EDIT: Added the bullet about Rivals of Tether."

I can't speak for Dan regarding what features will/won't make it into the game, but I would be very interested in a ranking system/website or whatever if RoA doesn't have one. Even if RoA does come with one, ranking websites help foster a community where people can easily discuss the game and seek improvement: see Smashladder for a good example of this."

RivalsOfAether,35x7dg,GatorFaceV,2,Thu May 14 18:19:05 2015 UTC,"That'd be WAAAAY COOL, but I dunno how Dan would feel about having to make new sprites and balance said sleep mechanic."
RivalsOfAether,35x7dg,someonetookjacob,1 point,Thu May 14 18:21:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats a good point... I would be fine if ""sleep"" just looked the same as the state after you get countered, but with little zzz's above your head.  This is supposed to be 32-bit inspired, and thats what all those old RPGs did (and I still think its adorable.)  Balance wise though... no idea?  It would have to be a short sleep I guess.  Maybe if the benefit was similar to successfully countering, but at higher percents it lasted longer, and mashing got you out sooner."
RivalsOfAether,35x7dg,GatorFaceV,2,Thu May 14 18:42:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm, yeah yeah that could work. Only big issue is mashing the buttons to get out. Cuz I'm pretty sure there isn't a single instance in RoA (yet) where mashing the buttons is encouraged (which I'm sure in turn discourages scrubbing). For instance, Wrastor's neutral specials works like Meta Knight's where it can rise and do extra damage. However, with Meta Knight you mash b and with Wrastor you just hold b."
RivalsOfAether,35x7dg,someonetookjacob,2,Thu May 14 19:47:00 2015 UTC,Yeah.  I included that because I thought it could be a sort of... grab like thing? but I see your point.  but holding a button doesnt make much sense either.  And I like the idea of some kind of player input shortening the sleep.  Not sure what would fit well though.
RivalsOfAether,35x7dg,GatorFaceV,1 point,Thu May 14 20:18:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe instead of sleep, the player could be poisoned... I guess that would be a little too similar to zetterburn though..."

After either three seconds/movement you take a small amount of damage and are put into hitstun. This can persist for about as long as Zetter's fire, and can be way disruptive to enemy combos. Maybe it can be like a defensive move idk"
RivalsOfAether,35x7dg,DMthePerson,2,Thu May 14 20:39:05 2015 UTC,"or, on a topic of pokemon.  It could work sort of like leech seed.  and you could drain (raise) your opponents percent to heal (lower) yours.  Maybe as an added thing if you KO your opponent while they are leeched you get a bulk lump of healing? perhaps some fraction of their total %.  I would be happy with either of these ideas.

RivalsOfAether,35x7dg,DaTigerMan,2,Thu May 14 21:27:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe it could be a plant monkey?  C4 is cool, but I'm thinking a plant character would have stuff that would grow over time (or manually, like Villager's tree)."
RivalsOfAether,35x7dg,DaTigerMan,1 point,Fri May 15 14:51:56 2015 UTC,"Thats a cool idea. Maybe the character can leave vines in the ground that if you walk in, you will become slower, but you won't take any damage."
RivalsOfAether,35x7dg,someonetookjacob,2,Fri May 15 16:24:27 2015 UTC,$10 it's an ice character
RivalsOfAether,35x7dg,DaTigerMan,4,Thu May 14 12:11:32 2015 UTC,I think it is going to be a plant/wood character because D4nace recently posted a picture of a Tree stage. He also hinted at a plant character into the comments of the picture.
RivalsOfAether,35x7dg,ijames428,1 point,Thu May 14 16:38:35 2015 UTC,"Probably, I haven't been following development, just taking a guess lol"
RivalsOfAether,35x7dg,DMthePerson,5,Thu May 14 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"So to fill you (and anyone interested in) There was a post on the smashboards page where a guy shared two of his character ideas.  One was a big heavy slow living tree.  One was a Slide-y Ice bear.    Dan responded by saying ""Cool ideas :). You're not too far off with one of those. Won't tell you which haha.""  whether that is just the general animal, or if it extends to the moves and playstyle is not known. (most at this point assumed he was talking about the next character to be reveled, thinking it would be an Icebear, because we got the fire and water elements first)  Then later, as Icarius said, Dan showed the next characters stage is a tree. So it will probably be an earth elemental.    You can also see vines in the RoA logo, Kragg is not plant based at all, so perhaps the other earth character will be?  So there is some evidence to support a plant wielding tree character.  This is (I think) all the info we have to base our predictions off of at the moment. I just wanted to share all the reasons it might be a plant wood tree man."

Dunno if I can explain the full application process perfectly, so here's an exact quote from the Smashboards post.   If you think you have what it takes to assist the development, we are looking for passionate playtesters. Apply by emailing us [here](roa.game@gmail.com). In the subject line, put your 'Playtester Application - Your Smash Tag' then in the body explain in 200 words or less why you are the perfect fit to be a playtester. If you already applied through our frontpage post then you are still on our list as we increase our numbers but feel free to re-apply and explain why you are the perfect fit.

RivalsOfAether,35ai94,someonetookjacob,2,Fri May 8 14:04:45 2015 UTC,"When you absorb the water, his side b does double (or may just be extra) damage and has much higher knockback. Cool tidbit about the Wolf similarity though."
RivalsOfAether,35ai94,GatorFaceV,2,Fri May 8 16:02:30 2015 UTC,"I kind of wish it increased the size of the burst instead, It would probably be less useful but it would be more noticeable and more consistent with how the puddle interacts with his strong attacks."
RivalsOfAether,35ai94,GatorFaceV,2,Fri May 8 17:47:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's moreover that it'd make you want to enhance the side b with puddle. Cuz if it's just stronger, a kill move, and you have to be on the ground with the puddle to use it, it just becomes a much more situational puddled strong attack. The bigger blast would be much more disruptive and way cool looking."
RivalsOfAether,35ai94,Over9000BaconPerHour,2,Fri May 8 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed,  To be honest most of the time I use the puddle with side b its on accident, and I am more upset I have to set another puddle than I am glad for the extra dmg and knockback (As you can maybe deduce from me not even realizing thats what you gained)    Other options that might be fun for the puddle+side-b are  a) make using the puddle reduce end lag or not put you into helpless (if you end in the air) or  b) give you armor on the move, so you can't be knocked out of it before your hitbox comes out.  Basically in conclusion, I like that side b interacts with the puddle, but I wish what it did was more interesting."
RivalsOfAether,357chp,Over9000BaconPerHour,2,Thu May 7 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't found any reliable engagement options with Forsburn yet, so I've been playing around with a new, campier playstyle.   So, how do you play Forsburn defensively? Am I doing something wrong or is that just how Forsburn is?"
RivalsOfAether,357chp,d4nace,5,Thu May 7 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"I play Forsburn two ways. Aggro and Defensive. It depends on who you are playing and what character they are using.  Against Zburn, I prefer to go defensive simply because up close Zetterburn has faster options. Against everyone else I usually play pretty aggro.  I did find Wrastor to be one of his hardest matchups until I started using the Down Special more. You can combo into it with Forward Air and kill off the top quite early.  When playing aggressive Forsburn, there are some tools that help. Nair has surprisingly good range. It is way better than Fair in the neutral. Up Air stuffs Wrastor's approaches pretty nicely. Forsburn's parry being in front of him means you can punish certain approaches safely. If Wrastor is approaching you with aerials (like Nair or Fair) just parry then Down Strong if he has a high enough percent.  Forsburn's dash attack is another nice tool. It is pretty good at catching people off guard. It comes out pretty fast and can start a combo. It is nice for punishing people who try to jump toward or away from you when you dash dance.  Also watching your video, you land a pretty good amount of openings. One thing I saw you do is teleport into smoke then teleport again higher to get away from Orcane. If he already whiffed then you might as well just go hit him instead of teleporting again. If he hits you, chances are he will get you right away or during your next teleport startup so try a fast fall Nair or Dair instead of Teleport. Overall though you played the matchup pretty well. If Orcane is getting repetitive with NSpecial -> FStrong then try to parry the FStrong."
RivalsOfAether,357chp,someonetookjacob,1 point,Thu May 7 23:38:38 2015 UTC,"Amazing writeup, lots of great points. I didnt know that teleporting into smoke totally resets you! I thought it only reset up-special. Thats awesome, and Im going to play with that now.  I admit I never understood the power of forsburn's parry until you mentioned approaches, I always used it when the opponent was already too close. Because his parry doesnt actually work if the opponent hits your body, the parry often didnt work."
RivalsOfAether,357chp,someonetookjacob,2,Fri May 8 00:14:35 2015 UTC,"When I play forsburn generally I dont have nearly as much smoke on stage... due to lag issues, so I have a much more aggressive style.  One thing I do try to do with smoke is start the game or set by setting up some smoke off stage to aid in recoveries later, If the opponent tries to follow you can often punish, and if they go to destroy the smoke later and commit to much you can punish that too, or set up more smoke or a clone.  If i can get in with a dash attack that will usually lead to a n-air or d-air. Out of n-air you can often get another dash attack or another n-air, or it can lead into a jab combo (which is a nice kill)  If you can get the opponent above you you can juggle them really effectively with f-air and u-air.  If you get room, I put out a clone every opportunity I get, and I try to take hits for it at the start.  The clone seems to like u-tilt and up-smash alot, so I do those moves while standing on top of the clone when I can, because they mesh well together when two are happening at once.  I use waaaay fewer smashes than you do, without charging the first hit doesnt always lead the the second, f-smash is good for edge guarding but... not much else (at least for me).  I usually get kills from jab combos or a stray down strong (which I do use alot)   All that said... my forsburn is just okay.  I have alot of trouble against wrastor and am not really sure how to fight him, he seems able to DI away whenever he has his slipstream out, and he combos real hard.  Sorry... that was dumb long, and only kind of answered your question?  TLDR: I play more aggressive. I n-air alot, and dont fight wrastor."
RivalsOfAether,352yg7,d4nace,14,Wed May 6 17:45:00 2015 UTC,A 1v1 ranked ladder would be amazing. Maybe using an ELO system with different ranks/tiers. Or at least keeping track of w/l ratio.
RivalsOfAether,352yg7,BoastingToast,3,Wed May 6 17:52:45 2015 UTC,Yeah. We'll want to have a ranked system of some kind. ELO makes the most sense in my head.
RivalsOfAether,352yg7,ijames428,4,Wed May 6 19:14:09 2015 UTC,"I'd personally really like to actually see my rank/elo. I like seeing who's around me in my rank, who's at the top, stuff like that."
RivalsOfAether,352yg7,BoastingToast,3,Wed May 6 19:52:31 2015 UTC,"I have a question for you. How will latency be handled in the netcode? Will there be input delay, or will there be teleporting around and false positives on hits?"
RivalsOfAether,352yg7,mefford_howell,1 point,Thu May 7 04:32:56 2015 UTC,Input delay will be our fallback. We are looking into rollback though (which is the second example you describe). Rollback has the advantage of having your motions feel 1 to 1.

RivalsOfAether,352yg7,snaplodon,8,Wed May 13 00:41:56 2015 UTC,"Ranked matchmaking for 1v1 and 2v2 would be a big deal to me, and cool rank types are always nice too. Saying that your rank is Gold 2 is a lot more fun than saying that your ELO is 200.  Also being able to set up online tournaments would be a lot of fun. Kind of like an offshoot of lobbies, if people could set up and run their own tournaments online, that could be a fun way for online communities or streamers to plan RoA activities together."
RivalsOfAether,352yg7,solarDerivative,3,Wed May 6 18:25:00 2015 UTC,Hadn't thought too much about naming the ranks but it is a fair point. Will think about that.
RivalsOfAether,352yg7,TonyMcConkey,2,Wed May 6 19:14:27 2015 UTC,"I completely agree on this, rank tiers are what keep me coming back. Telling someone what tier you are in immediately establishes your skill level, while ELO is more muddy."
RivalsOfAether,352yg7,jam1garner,6,Fri May 8 02:03:16 2015 UTC,"Agreeing with many of the suggestions put forth, don't really feel the need to re-state anything. I think that it would be really nice to implement a ""sandbag stage"" where you can warm up while in queue a la Smash. I do believe that there should be a ladder of some sort and that players should be able to see how they compare to other players. Something that I think would make this REALLY cool is to do what they do in Awesomenauts, where, on a player's space on the leaderboard, it shows their win rate and general ranking as you may expect, but it also has an icon of their most played character."

RivalsOfAether,352yg7,jam1garner,5,Wed May 6 18:00:55 2015 UTC,We will definitely look to implement 2v2. 2 local vs 2 local. It is virtually the same as doing 1v1 in practice.

RivalsOfAether,34s2zc,IcariusKen,1 point,Mon May 4 17:08:48 2015 UTC,We also need an insect maybe...
RivalsOfAether,34s2zc,BoastingToast,1 point,Mon May 4 17:09:20 2015 UTC,Wait... is Kragg an insect or a reptile?
RivalsOfAether,34s2zc,Cirby64,2,Mon May 4 17:10:24 2015 UTC,Insect. He's a beetle.
RivalsOfAether,34s2zc,TonyMcConkey,1 point,Mon May 4 17:42:57 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Orcane would still count as a mammal. Orcane = Orca = Killer Whale = Mammal.

RivalsOfAether,34nndo,d4nace,3,Sat May 2 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, and I thought the stage was pretty before...    Are Screenshot Saturdays going to be a thing now? :o"
RivalsOfAether,34nndo,solarDerivative,3,Sat May 2 21:27:09 2015 UTC,man the more i see the more i wanna play early access please
RivalsOfAether,34nndo,grangach,2,Sun May 3 01:10:43 2015 UTC,are the bubbles just for effects?
RivalsOfAether,34nndo,IcariusKen,3,Sat May 2 20:48:16 2015 UTC,For now they are just a visual. But don't be surprised if they come to mean more on the Aether version.

RivalsOfAether,34nndo,Over9000BaconPerHour,1 point,Sun May 3 00:59:05 2015 UTC,I love the idea of Screenshot Saturday. The stage isn't too saturated at all.
