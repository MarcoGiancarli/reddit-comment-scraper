I had an S4, bought a 2013 X when it broke, and upgraded to the 2014 X. When I held my mom's S6, I was blown away. Felt way more premium than I thought it would, and kind of regretted not getting it, but then I realized my battery life was running laps around hers and I've still got basically stock Android.  Point is, other than the battery, the S6 is a really nice phone and runs well. You should enjoy using it, but keep a charger handy in case. Welcome to the master race, brother."

AndroidMasterRace,3dymz5,devynci,3,Tue Jul 21 05:55:43 2015 UTC,What is your big thing against Samsung? You've made like three comments in this thread that show unreasonably intense hatred for them.
AndroidMasterRace,3dymz5,Leon4320,-4,Tue Jul 21 07:02:51 2015 UTC,"Tons.   TouchWiz The regression that is the S6 The 'wannabe' attitude The cringey, awful ads Because they're common.   I went with Android because I want to be unique and not like the plebs. Samsung lowered Android. Samsung made Android a platform for the plebs. I will not have a phone for the common people.   This is why even Samsung must be peasantry. They are for peasants.  The true gloriousness lies on the hands of the few - the Nexus, the LG, the Sony, the HTC and so on."
AndroidMasterRace,3dymz5,devynci,2,Tue Jul 21 07:11:39 2015 UTC,"TouchWiz really isn't so bad anymore. I had an S4 which I almost immediately flashed with CyanogenMod, but this latest iteration keeps pretty much in line with Material Design and doesn't hog resources. Yeah, losing the removable battery and the SD card slot is kind of annoying. It's not like the S6 is the first or only Android phone to not have a removable battery, though. Fair enough. Samsung does a lot of things different from Apple, still, intentionally. I don't think they simply want to make an iPhone; they want to make something a lot better that still caters to a similar market. You might not understand it, but there is a market for phones that look good. Personally, I went with the S6 more for its size and appearance than anything else. The trend of > 5"" Android phones like the Nexus 6 doesn't really fit my usage. Yeah, they do that. That has nothing to do with the quality or utility of what they make though. So you would hate, say, the OnePlusOne if it were the most common Android device? I don't think that's reasonable.   Your last few sentences are even less reasonable and sound like /r/iamverysmart material. Okay, so you're a special snowflake. Have fun with that.  Oh, and somehow HTC is still better? Sense is just as heavily modified as TouchWiz, and the HTC One M9 is absolutely a regression over the M8. No removable battery, poor battery life, tends to overheat, camera doesn't live up to the other flagship phones, and they didn't really add anything significant other than the new speakers.  But Samsung is for common people, obviously. And you're not a commoner. You're a special snowflake. Gotcha."
AndroidMasterRace,3dymz5,Leon4320,-5,Tue Jul 21 07:27:24 2015 UTC,"Ugh, you simply don't understand. Of course you wouldn't. You own an S6.  The Master Race is not the pleb race, dear. You have to understand that."

AndroidMasterRace,3dymz5,devynci,0,Tue Jul 21 10:41:47 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with the battery life on my S6. The biggest power usage I found was from having location enabled. Just toggle Location off in the quick settings when you're not using it, and you should save a lot of power.  I get a full day out of mine pretty easily, and I only lose about 1-2% per hour at idle. The battery in the S6 + its efficiency should still beat whatever iPhone you were using before."

AndroidMasterRace,3dymz5,Leon4320,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:14:09 2015 UTC,"Well, the S6 should be an improvement. Assuming you just got it, I was told that it takes a few complete battery cycles to really get the most out of it, and that seems to be true from my experience. Drain it completely about three times and it should be even better.  And again, keeping location off really helps."

I have a strong feeling it might be a couple months till I can get an invite, even though they are sending out 30-50x this time.

AndroidMasterRace,3e0ihg,MiniMoose12,0,Tue Jul 21 08:14:08 2015 UTC,"The Nexus also doesn't have a removable back, is it a iPhone6+?"
AndroidMasterRace,3e0ihg,Spl4tt3rB1tcH,2,Tue Jul 21 10:15:38 2015 UTC,"Nexus is a completely different. It's plastic and the ""stock"" android experience. You don't see Google Releasing renders of Metal Embellished Edges and a fancy pen in gold. The point of calling it an Iphone 6 is because they are changing their design from productivity to fashion accessory that the note 4 owners are pretty missed at. And just dont say it. Fast Charging will never replace a convenient battery swap."

Just flash a custom ROM and you are good to go.  I never even considered buying a Samsung because they just look ugly and feel bad. Np, I don't need sdcard slots or exchangeable batteries with 64gigs+ and two days of battery life (Well atleast that's what I'm getting with my Oneplus One and Nexus6) as long as there is good custom ROM/kernel development, and the phone doesn't run hot or feels shit when I'm holding/using it."

The ""TWRP"" recovery is just like windows's own safe mode (the one in black and  white). Your phone already has one, but the custom recovery will allow you to flash files, mods, and roms (OS) and modify your phone at will. You can also fall back to it if you fail something.  Unlocking (the bootloader) will allow flashing new roms. AFAIK, on my old xperia Ion, I hadn't unlocked so I couldn't flash roms. I could flash mods, and I was rooted.  Rooting is the same as getting the admin password for windows. It allows modifications inside the OS, and also allows apps like Titanium backup, Adblock, Secure Settings...  Apps that need more permissions than basic apps.  I hope that will help you a bit !"

The .zip files are to be used when booted in TWRP (after rebooting the phone, usually there's a button combo to press to access the recovery.  Then, you press the files, and they'll be flashed. Then reboot.  When flashing a new rom you MUST do a factory reset from TWRP, plus a cache+dalvik cache wipe. Else you'll get problems.  .IMG files are used when your phone is connected to your PC, to flash via ADB (Android debug bridge) Recovery is easier though. Depends on how you will need to set things up for the recovery."

AndroidMasterRace,3dqiep,MammothCheese,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:51:28 2015 UTC,"Why do you have to extract and flash it manually? That should work through TWRP. If it doesn't then this won't work, but checking for and downloading updates is still possible, as is creating and restoring backups (provided that you have a recent version of TWRP).  As for the updates: This simply just downloads the top file from your device's product page (https://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=victara for example) so it's exactly the same, but there isn't much point in just flashing the boot.img afaik since it's the same for every update, the changes for each ROM happen in the system-folder."

She's actually pretty good as the words personal and assistant. Siri jerks around too much to be an assistant, and Google Now is too strict and robotic to be personal. Cortana is very interesting in that she can do both, and she can switch between the two effortlessly. Of course, she's not native, so she has limitations. But overall, as a basic functioning voice control/assist, it's kind of impressive.  There's a lot more that can be done with her and a lot of functionality to be added, but if Microsoft really nail everything after this, then I'll be pretty interested in having Cortana stay.   But I return to Google Now. So much access to functionality can't be ignored, and I get enough personality from my customized home screen and ""theme"" anyway."

The 1080p 441ppi) on my S4 is perfectly fine, and I don't see why every new phone has 1440p. It's a waste of battery. Maybe I'll be able to tell the difference even I upgrade in a couple months.   Now to the issue at hand. HD is such a broad spectrum. 4k has about 2.5 exactly 3 times the pixel density, and it's also HD. 720 is the lowest to qualify for HD, and IMO it's way too low. 1080p is fine, for now.  Edit: I didn't realize 4k (2160p) was exactly 3 times 720p"

AndroidMasterRace,3digxj,hunter_finn,2,Thu Jul 16 20:03:31 2015 UTC,What specific features do a Mac have that an equally specced pc does not
AndroidMasterRace,3digxj,red_leader2101,3,Thu Jul 16 23:53:13 2015 UTC,"The ""equally specced"" thing is actually one of the interesting snags, because Macs usually have top-of-the-line components and great build quality. You can build an equally specced Wintel PC, but some people just prefer to plunk down cash and say ""give me a machine that doesn't suck"".  The OS X operating system is also interestingly built. It has Unix kernel and userland, and a windowing system that is basically roundaboutly descended from NeWS/NeXTStep which Unix rejected long ago for random pointless licencing reasons (there's always been a huge bunch of people who have been claiming X Window System was a stupid idea to begin with and new systems should have gone with the NeWS/NeXTStep concepts).  As a Linux person I wouldn't say OS X is objectively better at stuff, but it has neat little design details that make life a bit easier for developers and users. (One example: applications can be entirely self-contained - in most cases, you just drag the app to /Applications and you're done. Also, apps may at the same time have binaries for multiple architectures - that's how they handled the PPC-Intel transition period.)  I'll probably just say that it's a Unix system with all the good that comes from that, and they kinnnda thought long and hard about how to make the system more usable. It's not that OS X is magically better at some things, it's just that Unix-based OSes have generally been damn good compared to the Windows mess. And even that is becoming less of an issue because these days Windows sucks much less than it used to. (I actually kind of like 8.1 and I even have high hopes for Windows 10. I know, unbelievable comment coming from a Linux fan.)"

Yes you can have hacindos so you could run mac os on windows pc but it is lot easier to do it otherway around."
AndroidMasterRace,3digxj,hunter_finn,-1,Fri Jul 17 01:52:31 2015 UTC,"I have a few friends at my university with macs, and I've been debating a lot about macs with them. The point comes from software, not hardware,  so I have to agree with the fact macs are awesome at media production. Workflow and software packages themselves are faster and more stable, compared to Windows. For example Sony Vegas crashes constantly on windows, so it is a reflex to hit ctrl+s every time you do something,  but I have never seen it crashed on Mac. Also buffer for dragging files is really faster. However, this does not excuse how awful Macs are for everything else. I once made a tool in Qt and C++, and I needed to compile it for Windows, Linux and Mac. Since I use Linux compiling for it was very easy, for Windows there is a tool to produce Win32\64 executables under Linux in a flash, but for OSX - nope, no such tool, because Apple are greedy fucks, and apparently to make something for Mac, you have to do it on Mac. Ok, I asked my friend to compile it for me his Mac, and it was the worst PC experience in my life. So Qt software is compiled and developed in programme called QtCreator. There are versions for all the systems,  we downloaded it, and it turned out it needs git and some other very small console tools. But to get those tools on Mac you HAVE to install absolutely useless Xcode, and then  install tools from it. So to get 32mb at most you just have to download and install nearly 6gb of crap. Ok, so after this application compiled with QtCreator would not start, and after days of searching it turned out Mac compiler for C++ was broken in this version of Mac, so naturally gcc, a compiler I always use seemed as a good alternative,  but to install it you wold need a macports, and also a whole new chroot with Unix libs in it... So yeah, if I've been forced to use Macs as a developer, it would be a total nightmare. From both political and user perspective. But if you are working with video\sound\images, I can get where are you coming from saying Macs are better."

People were expecting A7 in it, but surprise, A8.  It's basically the iPhone 6 now without the phone part, and even that you can add through Oovoo or Skype (or Hangouts!). At a quarter of the price.  My only dip into iOS was a 4th gen iPT which is now dead because the battery puttered out. But if you want an inexpensive (relatively) entry into iOS (if say you wanted to develop apps), the iPT is certainly the go-to.  The only iDevice I'd ever even think about buying would be the iPT. iPhone sucks hard, and Surface kicks the iPad's ass. But I ain't ditching my GS4 - but I would gladly ditch my GS4 for a Nexus 6."

AndroidMasterRace,3djh5r,ItIsShrek,8,Fri Jul 17 14:44:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, because the heat produced is entirely dependent on the size of the enclosure, and has nothing to do with the efficiency or heat management of the chip itself. Also, the only thing the new chip does is produce more heat than a 3 year old chip, right? By that beautiful logic, now that the SD 810 has overheating problems, Qualcomm is simply doomed, because no matter what they do their future processors will only produce more heat than the current one, right?"

You're basing your arguments on stupid assumptions, that you can't justify either. If you're saying ""it overheated back then, it'll overheat now"" then answer my question.

AndroidMasterRace,3djh5r,Alexlam24,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:13:32 2015 UTC,"Nope. The 2013 model had up to N and that was the same year they introduced AC AirPorts (Apple's WiFi routers), and slowly have been adding AC with every product release, starting with the computers. iPhone 6s just got it, 5S had N and so forth. However, I've tried both N and AC on my Turbo and haven't noticed a significant difference so I don't know how effective it is. Maybe if you have gigabit/Google Fiber speeds."
AndroidMasterRace,3djh5r,BlackLightzHD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:57:28 2015 UTC,"The main difference is in local network transfers, unless of course you have Google gigabit. If your N connection already supports the maximum bandwidth of your Internet and you don't transfer files over your wifi, N should be fine.   Apple is moving towards wireless syncing with the Macbook, so having AC in all their devices would make that easier."
AndroidMasterRace,3dicid,Asgaro,3,Thu Jul 16 14:42:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I finally moved on from my (around) 5 years old smartphone a few weeks ago. It's the Samsung Wave S8500: at the time it was really a good bang for its buck, but the disadvantage was the OS being Samsung Bada.  I never tried flashing Android roms onto it. Part because of laziness, part because of fear for bricking it. So I was essentially stuck with an OS which hasn't received updates for years, and never even came close to Android Froyo back in the days to begin with! Also, I wouldn't call it ""stuck"": it's just that I didn't know better! (More on that in a bit.)  So yes... I've essentially been living under a rock regarding mobile. It's due to my master's thesis I have right now that I've come really into close contact with all the latest things in mobile: Internet of Things, Android 4+, Pebble smartwatch, sensor usage, ... I really had an epiphany so the urge to upgrade asap was there.  I always brushed remarks from my friends, etc. off with saying ""All I need is texting and I'm good. I bet most smartphone apps are still shitty and I bet most of you only text and browse with it."" Well, that's probably true for some users, but now that I have spent literally weeks catching up regarding the Android ecosystem (androidpolice.com news archive ftw!) I'm honestly blown away. I really thought smartphone usage wasn't yet up to par to a desktop experience so most browsing, etc. are still better done on a nice 22"" widescreen screen, but I was totally wrong.  All I did with my Samsung Bada phone was text from time to time. Using social network sites like FB I only did on my desktop. I had 3G data support but didn't really browse with the outdated Dolphin browser since the phone became warm pretty fast and drained the battery a lot. On top of that there were render issues due to the old browser.  All in all, I can't be more happy with my new purchase: the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact! Did quite some research before making a decision since I plan to do around 5 years with those one as well. I needed flagship performance, a small size, and good battery performance. This device has all these features and I'm more than happy! It's a 4.6"" screen but personally, if there was an even more compact variant, I would have chosen that. Though, now that I'm used to 4.6"" I don't know whether I would want smaller. But I definitely don't feel the need to go bigger. Still baffled at the fact 4.6"" is now considered ""small"".  As said, I only buy a new mobile device about every 5 years. If anyone's interested, here all the devices I ever had in a side by side overview: http://i.imgur.com/w7gOxff.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/MH99WoY.jpg  Edit: Also very pleasantly surprised with the Android Lollipop look. My sister has had an iPhone 5s since a few years. When I told here I would finally move on and would go for an Android device, she said she didn't like the look of the OS. I checked the evolution of the Android UI and I have to agree with her. Android didn't really look that attractive visually when compared to iOS. It's only since the recently released Lollipop I personally feel Android's UI has become up to par with iOS UI or even better."

(The 5 years interval is not something I set in stone but just an estimation.) I feel good knowing I can last long with a device: that means I made a good purchase. Also, if I have to choose between performance or a lower price, I always choose performance considering I want it to last several years.  (In hindsight, the fact my previous device had the Bada OS was actually not a good decision lol. But I still felt good because of the decent hardware!)  So it's not really that I'm short on money, it's more of a mindset and the fact I feel satisfied when I get my years out of a purchase. Another example: I'm a PC gamer (/r/pcmasterrace sub!) but there it's the same: every 5 years or so, I do big upgrades. I don't do incremental upgrades in between (normally). (Also buy all my games in sales but there I'm not really an exception.)"

So whenever I was listening to Spotify and got a text I had to leave the app to read it and then restart it again which of course cut the music off. I don't even think you could multitask until iPhone 4/IOS 4 (officially). Think I got a jailbreak tweak for it. Then I got a HTC sensation.

The only problem I had with them was that while the technology Nokia built was absolutely solid, they seemed to make some really weird and pointless business decisions, like building their own mobile services and sticking to the archaic Symbian garbage in the smartphone side. I was totally sure they'd eventually go Android or something.  ...and then, in 2011, there was a big announcement forthcoming that they'd switch to something more modern for the smartphones.  That announcement didn't go well.  The next phone I got is a Samsung."

When I had the stroke, I found it difficult to use my phone (Samsung Galaxy S5) with one hand, since my right hand was paralyzed from said stroke. After I gotten movement in my arm back, I continued to use the iPhone until one day, I randomly went to the mall and sat down near my carrier's store. I then decided to go back to Android and get a Samsung Galaxy S5. I missed the homescreen widgets, the customization, and I like multiwindow. Not to mention the expandable storage space (the store only had the 16gb model - I came from a 32gb iPhone) and wireless charging.  I wished there was a flagship phone with a smaller screen that had updates, but then the one-handed mode makes it tolerable.   TL;DR: Had a stroke; went to the dark side. Got better, went towards the light and back with the master race."
AndroidMasterRace,3did62,all3z,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:49:25 2015 UTC,Ability to flash firmware. If an update sucked? Just downgrade.  Much better backups. Nandroid backups are the best thing ever. Was in school one day and was playing around with xposed. Something went south. 10 minutes later I was back on track. Titanium backup isgreat love being able to upload backups to my drive. Google photos is great.   I also like being in control of my device.  Xperia Z3 battery life is insane. SD cards. List goes on.   To sum it up I'd say being in control of my device and the freedom of having the same OS on different devices. I always got jailbreak for my iPhone anyway so I was kind of looking for features that Android had. Only that they slowed the device down and made it crash more often. Those features built into an OS is way better than any tweak on cydia. That you'd have to wait 6 months after every update didn't make it any better.

I was coming from a shit Samsung phone running Bada that died, so anything would've been an upgrade at that point. I sat down and thought hard, pros and cons. The iPhone had a fingerprint sensor, which I like, but 4 inches is a bit on the small side for me. The Galaxy S4 (which my brother bought) is a bit big and plastered with Touchjizz everywhere so it was a no-no. And then came Moto, with their near-stock Android, quick update promises (top kek), and quirky features (Active Display <3, Twist to Camera). Motomaker was a nice plus, but I was so desperate to get a good phone that I blew it off and got a Woven White model from AT&T (two big mistakes, lessons for next time). It was also $23 a month on Next vs. $32 for the iPhone so that was nice. Sometimes I regret my choice, but in truth I don't think any other phone at the time would have made me happier. A 4.7"" iPhone might have pulled me over to iOS but I'll leave that to the land of what-ifs.  That said, I'm ultra hyped for the 28th, my relationship status could use a change ;)"

I don't think it's still the same as that build they released for the OPO.  Price probably will be okay as long as it stays around 400$, but everyone has it's own price limits.  But yes, the QSD810 is a deal breaker. I won't buy any phone with that chip."
AndroidMasterRace,3dhtr7,pr0xidian,4,Thu Jul 16 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"For me, I'm waiting to see how they handle root access and rom support. The fact that I have access to the Pac-Man rom on my original is very important, as its the only rom I ever want to run on any phone I buy. Any phone without that rom is a dealbreaker for me personally, and the original phone handled unlocking/rooting better than most phones I know."
AndroidMasterRace,3dhtr7,Spl4tt3rB1tcH,3,Thu Jul 16 15:50:09 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Oneplus is the first company who's okay with rooting and unlocking. That's amazing and I hope it stays like that.  I'm not a pac-man guy tho, it's already too bloated for me. But franco kernel support is extremely important to me.

I'm not saying Caitlyn Jenner is intersex, she was born a male, however, A - we're regarding her GENDER, B - her sex is also partially changed. Yes, genetically, she still has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. That doesn't make her a man, that merely means that genetically she's male. Sex isn't just genetics."

Sex is what the getting code says (Caitlyn has one x and one y chromosome, there's no arguing against that) so there is only 1 indicator of sex and that's genes  Gender is what you identify yourself as. (Caitlyn identifies as a woman)  So her sex is male but her gender is female.  Sex is very black and white.

AndroidMasterRace,3dhm72,popinloopy,3,Thu Jul 16 22:07:51 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this by saying these are all just my own personal opinion on what you should do.  First, install a custom OS, as Samsung's isn't very good (as you have said). I use CyanogenMod, so for the purpose of this, I will assume you will use the same. CM allows you to customize many things, including overclocking or underclocking your CPU. You can underclock that for better battery life. I personally use this guide for all my battery saving needs.  As for rooted apps, a quick Google search can help you with finding some neat ones. I personally use the All-in-One Toolkit, Root Browser, SuperSU, Titanium Backup, and a myriad of other things. If you need more examples, feel free to ask."
AndroidMasterRace,3dhm72,tehDemonseye,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:30:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you!! I have supersu and titanium backup currently, will look into getting the others later.   Ive seen xpose mentioned alot, not sure what it is though. Also if i wanted to get CM are there any certain precautions i need to do before i get it? Im assuming i will lose all my current data, what do i do in TB to make sure i can easily save all my data on my phone before switching OS.   Thanks in advanced!"
AndroidMasterRace,3dhm72,popinloopy,3,Fri Jul 17 00:37:08 2015 UTC,"Xposed, to my knowledge (I don't know much about it, so you're better off asking someone else. Hopefully this is enough to hold you over until someone else tells you) is a framework that allows for the installation of ""modules"" or apps that let you have more control of your device by having access to things that you normally wouldn't. I think?  As for CM and precautions, you are correct in assuming you should do a backup. Open TB and press the options button on your phone (I don't know what to call it, but it's normally to the left of the home button). Press preferences and change the default location to your SD card (or just do the backup and later move it to your computer or some other external storage so it doesn't get wiped). After that, go back to the options menu thing and press Batch Actions. From there, I recommend doing Backup All User Apps + System Data. Then boot into your recovery on your phone and do a full system backup from there, just to be sure. I use ClockworkMod Recovery, but I accidentally used TWRP once so I can tell you it's not that different functionality wise in backing up (just stick with TWRP and don't switch to a different recovery).  Now that you're all backed up and everything is on some external storage, I get yourself the official CyanogenMod zip that is supported for your device. Also, while you are at it, get the Gapps zip file for the version of CM you are using so you can use the Play Store and stuff. Boot into your recovery and install from zip. Locate and install the CM zip. Once that's done, do the same for the Gapps zip. Reboot your device. If after a couple hours it's still on the loading screen, boot back into your recovery and click the WIPE ALL DATA button, then reboot once that is done (see why your stuff should be on an external storage?) Assuming everything went as planned, you should have CM.  Now, I personally recommend opening the play store immediately and installed TitaniumBackup once again so you can immediately restore all your apps and everything else you so desire (be careful when restoring, as restoring the wrong version of a system app can be very bad.) I also recommend installing the Xposed framework thing before restoring apps and downloading/installing/activating the Autoinstall module so you have less prompts to deal with when restoring your apps.  Have fun!"

There is a lower limit to the minimum deployment target for apps published with a current iOS version if you want your app approved in the app store. That is why older iPhones and the original iPad suddenly lost access to apps that worked fine. It is not because the newer versions suddenly required more hardware, Apple does not want you to create apps for older devices.   And here I am, targeting 99.7% of the incredibly ""fragmented"" Android thanks to it's support libraries and the lack of mandatory planned obsolescence. I don't care if it's a Nexus One (contemporary to the 3GS), if it's running Android 2.3 it'll run."

AndroidMasterRace,3d66cs,BumBumiLikeBum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:22:05 2015 UTC,Planned obsolescence is pretty much universal. Some android manufacturers are even worse offenders than Apple.   I think that Apple products are more prone to shattering because 100% of them are made of glass. Whereas the variety of android phones are a mixture of glass and plastic. Conformation bias I would think.

As web developers, we take pride in what we do.  But what we do typically does not concern ad placement or marketing tactics.  What we do is design a website atop a platform that suites our client's needs.  Typically this means using content management systems such as WordPress or Joomla (as much as we hate it, we can't bother to teach our clients to use HTML and then have them break their site trying to insert bold text).  Once we finish developing and setting up the site, it's out of our hands.  Ads like these are installed through plugins that the marketing teams are responsible for."

AndroidMasterRace,3cz00b,JaseSpace18,24,Sun Jul 12 01:46:54 2015 UTC,Custom OS and the ability to remove bloatware were my reasons for rooting.
AndroidMasterRace,3cz00b,Err0rbot,6,Sun Jul 12 01:51:38 2015 UTC,What kind of custom OS? Like if your phone normally wouldn't update to the newest Android version (or if you wanted to revert to an older one?)
AndroidMasterRace,3cz00b,popinloopy,6,Sun Jul 12 01:54:04 2015 UTC,"CyanogenMod is the most common and popular custom OS. Some people install a Custom OS because they wwant to remove bloatware, others because they don't like the default launcher, others still because they want the features of the new OS, and still more do it just because they can. And some people mix and match. I personally installed CM Mod because my Galaxy S3 stopped being updated by Samsung, so I had an outdated OS. It was stuck on 4.1.2 and with CM Mod I upgraded to 4.4.2 and could go to 4.4.4 or even 5.0 if I so desire (but I really like Jellybean and there's no stable, non-nightly version of either of the others yet that has worked well with my device.)  As for why you would root? Well, first thing that comes to mind is being able to do a full system backup. Also, even MORE customization past what Android already offers. Such things include overclocking or underclocking a CPU, uninstalling system apps, giving some apps access to things they didn't before, and being able to access files and folders you couldn't before.  Also, this. (Link.)  And so much more. While I'm not necessarily trying to convince you to root, I AM saying don't knock it till you try it. Maybe research it a bit, see if you find something you like about it."

For example, I you don't like heads up notification, you can stop them, and much much more  -Flat style colored modules: There's the Keyboard version, and the colored bars version. It lets you theme your navigation and status bar, as well as the Google Keyboard, for a specific app. For example, Google music is very orange, so you could as well have an orange Keyboard, nav bar and status bar  -Awesome popup video, it takes any video currently playing, and makes a resizable window out of it.

With cloud solutions like Google Drive handling documents, Google Photos handling photos, and Google Music handling cloud music, SD card storage isn't as big of a deal as years past, and frankly, that's good. I no longer lose data when I switch phones because everything is cloud-based, and that's great. My 32 GB phone has only 60% disk usage, with games like Hearthstone on it. Im the definition of an android power user. In college my tablet keeps my digital textbooks. I watch my media with a chromecast controlled through my phone. I do my budget and pay my bills with my phone. I'm telling you man, the Cloud lifestyle is the best lifestyle.   Although I also hate the removable batteries are going away.

If you have enough memory, Chrome loads on startup and stays in memory so when you click on it it feels like it is starting up quickly. But if you have little RAM or disable auto start, it will take forever reading from a slow hard drive before even opening the window, then an equally long time before the home page loads. Firefox reads a little from the hard drive, does some processing on the CPU (which is what makes it load slower than chrome on fast computers) and opens the window all ready to go.   Also, Chrome will always read from the disk when loading up websites, and makes it impossible to browse when copying files or installing things on an HDD since it will lock up while trying to read the cache.  I may switch when I upgrade to an SSD, but with the rather disk intensive stuff I usually do, Chrome just doesn't work."

Because not targeting the Apple Store when developing is loosing an enormous market. And I bet they calculated the fees so that when your app start to be popular, the sales makes up for the SDK fee. So if your app is worth it, you'll be rewarded of your investment.  Which is a big middle finger, once again, to the small indies who have nothing but passion and desire."

This is because in this case, the OS is actually designed like an OS should be--to give the user full control over the system. Because of this, there's only the much simpler challenge of figuring out how to modify the software to do what you want.

AndroidMasterRace,3cpxhg,AgentFork,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:37:02 2015 UTC,"a nexus is considered the top of the android hierarchy however most other brands are fine. I'm an HTC guy myself, because build quality, speakers, and how well optimized sense is. Samsung has pretty terrible software with an overwhelming amount of bloat (being slimmed down in more recent versions but is still really comparatively heavy.) They're also kinda going the route of apple, going form over function with smaller non removable battery, no microsd, no waterproofing, etc. As a final nail in the coffin, in my experience they age much worse than other devices. They become unbearably slow after a few months (just yesterday, I had a coworker show me how slow her note 4 has become after about 5 months, which should be a very capable device)."

I learned my lesson a long time ago when it comes to trying to prove something to someone who's head is in the sand.

In fact, I don't think they will give up Thunderbolt, because Intel announced it's going to be compatible with USB-C, so there's no real disadvantage for Apple to use Thunderbolt 3 in a future Macbook Pro, it would have the same capability as USB-C ports plus Thunderbolt speeds added on (which is good for the Pro line).   Lightning is a different story but they haven't shown any new iOS device yet so we don't know. It would make sense to use USB-C and it'd be convenient, but it's Apple, stuff that makes sense they don't bother with too many times."
AndroidMasterRace,3cmb96,ImmortalHamburger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:39:47 2015 UTC,"They wont get rid of either, because thunderbolt is many times faster than USB 3.1 Gen 2 and going away from lightning would make all the accessories made for it obsolete, and some of those accessories are pretty expensive.  Thunderbolt 3 is 40gbps, usb 3.1 Gen 2 is 10gbps.

I see a watch as design accesoire and all the watches, except the Moto 360 maybe, look very ""techy"" if that makes any sense. I usually wear Diesel watches and if a watch comes out that resembles those I will probably jump on it but it's probably very difficult to realize with a strictly digital display since it can never ""resemble"" the look of mechanical parts.

AndroidMasterRace,3ck652,freestyle112,9,Wed Jul 8 15:27:43 2015 UTC,"yeah I noticed that too... I used to swap ROMs like once a week on my galaxy prevail back in the gingerbread era. but back then, everything was smaller. like the ROMs and backups and stuff, they were like 90MB or something. now a backup takes almost 2GB, and that's too much. also, AOSP has gotten so good I don't need to flash different ROMs. I don't like stock android. it doesnt have as much of the cool stuff custom ROMs do, but my current ROM (Unofficial CarbonROM 5.1.1) has everything I need, so i don't have to flash any more ROMs or kernels and stuff. it just works out of the box. also, I don't have xposed cause it seemed to have crashed and slowed down my previous ROMs. maybe it was the ROMs themselves, but I can survive without it."
AndroidMasterRace,3ck652,creed10,2,Wed Jul 8 17:01:10 2015 UTC,Same. I used to mess around with my HTC Amaze attempting to find a solution to reduce it's overheating (How does 112°f while walking in winter in NYC sound) and the only solution to it was turn it off. This was in the age of locked HTC bootloaders and I was 16 at the time so no job. The thing that really pissed me off was it didn't even throttle itself. It would keep going to 125°f and at that point I would just yank the battery out because who knows how hot the actual insides of it are. The only good thing it had was a removable unibody aluminum construction.

AndroidMasterRace,3ck652,creed10,5,Fri Jul 10 18:07:42 2015 UTC,"Heh. Sorta similar, I guess. Started off with an HTC Wildfire years ago, tweaked the hell out of it, got a Galaxy S3 which hasn't spent a day on its original ROM... Then got a Nexus 4 and the tweaking slowed down significantly, and ultimately to stop with my current Nexus 5 (on which I only experimented with kernels a bit).  And I would venture a guess to say that it's got less to do with being tired of tweaking, and just more to do with the fact that the rewards of tweaking gradually fell off compared to the (admittedly not excessive) effort that it takes. I mean, I can still install a different launcher and set up a fantastic homescreen, flash another ROM or a kernel or a framework, but the added value of tweaks over the current state of stock Android is just not intriguing enough for me to be bothered.  I'm not saying that stock Lollipop is EVERYTHING. I'm not saying it's perfect, because nothing is. It's got some bugs. The battery management is certainly bad, and the camera crashes here and there. Other ROMs surely have features that stock does not.  But on the whole? It's become so good, so sleek and simple and usable and polished as it is, that I genuinely feel no reason to bother changing practically anything. I no longer need to change a ROM for my quick toggles to include the shortcuts I want (e.g. auto-rotate screen or wifi hotspot). I hardly need widgets to tell me the weather or news or to control music, since now I have Google Now and the perfectly usable notifications widgets by default. I no longer need to look for ROMs and kernels and launchers that provide me with 60fps lag-free experience, because I get that on a Nexus 5 by default. And the handful of features I still might want to use (like underclocking CPU or adjusting color profiles), frankly, I don't miss enough to bother even to install a kernel (like Franco). It's good enough. Or at least good enough for me to get by with until I get some new hardware that will render the issue moot by having a better battery and an even better screen by default. I use a handful of apps that are better than the defaults (Manual Camera instead of Google's own, Whatsapp in place of Hangouts), but that's largely it.  And just to harp briefly on the notion that this is ""like using an iPhone""... No. No it's not. I have an iPad 4 in the house, got it for free with the job because it uses some job-relevant and iOS-exclusive apps. I keep it updated and know my way around it. But I never use it outside of those particular job-related apps, because the experience is nowhere near as good. It's laggy, it's ugly, it's messy, and it tries its hardest to push me to use Apple's crappy apps in lieu of Google's suite (which I also use on my desktop). It's crap. And if I wanted to have that crap in my pocket, on an iPhone, I would have to pay 3x what I paid for my Nexus 5. Hell to the no.  tl;dr No tweaking is necessary anymore. The combination of Nexus hardware and stock Android has, for the largest part, just become that good."

Pushbullet is great for sending files, links, and notifications from one device to another, and allows sending texts from your computer.  Relay for Reddit is, in my opinion, the best Reddit app you can use. It fits my needs better than others, but there is a large number of Reddit apps for you to try and find one you prefer. Relay has a free version to try before buying.  Zedge is good for wallpapers and ringtones.  Wally is better for wallpapers, and with a screen as beautiful as the Note 4's, you need a good wallpaper.  Screenfilter is a great app for saving battery. It brings down the brightness to a level you set that's lower than what the default brightness toggle allows.  Solid Explorer and ES File Manager are the two best file managing and exploring apps I know of. Would recommend both if you're going to be going through your phones internal files.  Replace any Samsung apps with their superior Google counterparts. Don't forget to uninstall or disable as much carrier and Samsung bloat as possible if you aren't going to use any or most of them.

The clapping often bewilders the trainees, at least at first, but when the applause goes on for several lengthy minutes they eventually join in.   4   The idea is to instill in employees the notion that they are doing something far grander than just selling or fixing products.    5 (best one)   The average Apple Store employee makes about $30,000 a year.

AndroidMasterRace,3cbl6p,CholupaBatman,5,Tue Jul 7 11:49:31 2015 UTC,Cell phone carriers typically pay their retail salespeople about $12-16/hour plus commission around $1000-$1500/month.  It can vary widely especially by region.  The northeast has higher pay than the south or midwest because the cost of living is higher.  A motivated salesperson can do quite well and a lazy one can do quite poorly.

Plug all of the USB devices into the hub, the hub into the adapter and the adapter to the phone.  One you do this, you have the input and output you need.  Some phones ignore touch input when external input is detected.  Others don't.  Determine which is the case and use that to determine whether or not you should detach the digitizer (touchscreen).  Now go through the phone and enable MTP and connect it to the computer.  Backup your files and you're ready to go. Alternatively, use a micro USB to HDMI adapter to display the phone's screen on a monitor and then use the volume buttons to activate and navigate the recovery menu.  There should be a menu option for backup of the phone's memory.  Find the menu, figure out how to back it up, you should be able to handle it from there.

AndroidMasterRace,3c2tvh,pryvisee,8,Sat Jul 4 06:00:54 2015 UTC,I'm waiting until the next version. I don't know a whole lot but I've read the 360 has a really old processor in it and it has that bar at the bottom of the screen that other round watches don't.
AndroidMasterRace,3c2tvh,jtaylor991,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:11:36 2015 UTC,That's because it has much less of a bezel than other round watches. It has to be there but the other no bezel effects are glorious.
AndroidMasterRace,3c2tvh,OD_Emperor,2,Sat Jul 4 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"I got mine last time there was a price cut to it. I honestly love it. Does it have older specs? Sure. But it does what supposed to and it still looks really nice. They have made a lot of software improvements to it and, although you see a stutter here and there, it works really well and the battery life has improved a lot (I can easily get through a while day). And if you are worried about the black bar at the bottom, don't. It hardly ever notice it. I'd say it's well worth $150 =)"

I find it most useful when I am at work or when I am doing more active things (running, Drumming, playing Frisbee, things like that) . When you are active and you don't really want to take your phone out, it's perfect. I also listen to music a lot and it's really nice to be able to change the track, adjust the volume, and see what track is playing without having to use the phone. Try to think of it not so much as a new electronic/toy, as much as something the enhances your phone. If that helps at all haha  Oh... And when you get a message, it's really nice to look at your watch to see if the message is even worth taking out your phone to reply. That save me a lot of time too haha"

AndroidMasterRace,3bzj05,Psychoshy1101,19,Fri Jul 3 13:57:01 2015 UTC,I played it on my dad's work iPhone when I visited him for father's day.   It is a lot like a freemium but without the purchases. You do have to wait for things to finish sometimes and what not but I didn't find it as bad as if they were shoving micro transactions in my face   If I remember correctly you could rush orders but you had a chance of failing them and setting that room on fire.

If it had been released on time, they probably would have hyped me into buying a dweller pack because I love the franchise so much, without me even really thinking about whether the game was worth it.

This isn't out of decency or generosity, they are NEVER attributes of corporations, it is because Tesla is heavily invested in battery technology and electric car production - it could lead to massive profits.  As soon as electric car production takes off with a healthily competitive market then Tesla wouldn't dream of opening patents.  The case isn't similar with technology, its already well established so there is no need to open parents, and although I am against software patents as a concept it isn't reasonable to expect Apple or other companies to open their patents."

AndroidMasterRace,3br9as,kn33,7,Wed Jul 1 16:28:35 2015 UTC,Why is the data price so high in the states but in finland we have unlimited data 20€ month.
AndroidMasterRace,3br9as,hassinen,10,Thu Jul 2 00:13:29 2015 UTC,America is a lot bigger. There's a lot more infrastructure to maintain to provide that data
AndroidMasterRace,3br9as,kn33,3,Thu Jul 2 00:33:12 2015 UTC,So is the population big. Could it be that one carrier supports a big area of a state and they can just mark up the price since customers don't have much of an option?
AndroidMasterRace,3br9as,hassinen,3,Thu Jul 2 00:42:44 2015 UTC,"True, even if the American carriers end up with the same average customers per square mile of coverage that a European carrier would have it still requires a huge investment to cover the whole country. This makes it hard for new carriers to rise up as they have to cover most of the country before people will take them seriously as a competitor. So you end up with a duopoly situation. Hopefully the FCC puts some restrictions in their next spectrum auction so that it doesn't all get bought up by big carriers."

AndroidMasterRace,3br9as,starfire221,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:03:20 2015 UTC,It's when you (depending on the local setup) overload the router so it reboots and well it's rebooting you open your wifi and name yourself the routers old name. Then you tether yourself to the rebooted wifi or just use your own phone data and turn on wireshark. People seldom if ever look at the name of the wifi they connect onto. It's easy to try at like a mcdonalds or starbucks.
AndroidMasterRace,3br9as,nolekev1214,6,Thu Jul 2 13:12:41 2015 UTC,"Man, I really wish I could tether, but Straight Talk will cut you off if they catch you. Really sucks :("
AndroidMasterRace,3br9as,starfire221,4,Wed Jul 1 19:28:57 2015 UTC,Don't get caught. Change your user agent in browser to the same as your phone and limit the places data is coming from. Should be fine.

AndroidMasterRace,3br9as,Degru,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:46:55 2015 UTC,I doubt they even bother checking that. If you use massive amounts of data or hit your cap really fast then they'd look into it.

Then again, I haven't worn digital watches in the last 10 years, I just assume they've slimmed down by now (Casio G Shocks look so tacky).    About the Pebble, if you buy it with the right expectations, it's arguably MUCH better than any Android Wear watch. It can't do fancy stuff like Google Now, Ordering and Uber or Voice Dictation for replying to messages (though the new Pebble Time can do the last two), and apps support while string will not be as strong as Android wear's, but Notifications are perfect, Sunlight Legibility is awesome, and you can even run some bonus fitness apps (I use Up for Jawbone, which doesn't require an actual Jawbone up. It acts as a step counter (I can't comment on it's accuracy) and reminds me to take a walk every hour that I'm inactive, a'la apple watch.). Fro $50, it's ridiculous value for money."

I'm rooted on cm12.1 running xposed and it's by far the greatest phone experience I have ever had. Everything works perfectly and is so snappy. Things seem to load instantly. Not to mention fingerprint sensor support has been appearing in the changelogs for cm the last week and should be implemented soon! With a couple xposed modules and a custom kernel I get 7 hours screen on time off of a single charge (http://imgur.com/OtbHwqa) which has been another little bonus besides the camera, screen, removable battery/storage, and IP67 :p I'm rooting for you to get the s5 if you haven't figured it out by now. :)  With CM 12.1 you increase the performance compared to stock by a lot as well. The g3 doesn't even appear in the list on here because it's so far behind :x I have heard amazing things about the g3 so I'm not trying to bash on it in any way. I just wanted to share how happy I have been with the s5. I know benchmarking alone is not the greatest way to compare two phone experiences.  http://imgur.com/87EqUMr  I must add though that if you plan on staying on stock you should not expect all of the awesomeness I have told you about. Touchwiz is okay and is still fast but it is nothing compared to what this phone can do on an AOSP ROM.  Edit: oh fuck me.

The LG G3 on the other hand looks great and arguably gives you more for your money, depending on what you are looking for."
AndroidMasterRace,3bffrp,aidanski,-2,Mon Jun 29 15:58:03 2015 UTC,It does not. It comes with a crap OS compared to touchwiz (my opinion) and the screen causes overheating issues as well as causing the battery to deplete quicker. It is hard to get used to the buttons on the back and placing it on the table you're bound to hit the power button at some point when trying to use it like that. And as for lack of sd card support just get bigger internal storage and store the rest on the cloud. I'm sure you don't need more than 100gb on your phone.
AndroidMasterRace,3bffrp,ofalco,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:03:53 2015 UTC,"Objectively all the manufacturer 'skin' overlays are terrible. Yes, TW or LG's Android variant may both come with features to enhance the usage of the devices e.g. air view or S health on the Samsung devices and then LG's IR remote and tap to wake implementations. Those features are irrelevant though, as who here would endure the shoddy OS' provided when you can flash AOSP, CM and the rest? I agree that the higher resolution screen on the G3 will cause more drain, however I believe that the difference is negligible for a standard day's use. The button configuration on the G3 could take time to become accustomed to, however the screen is woken by double tapping and then put to sleep by double tapping the status bar. Additionally with a device that size, the button placement is actually a really good idea as you have no need to stretch to any one side of the device. Finally storage. Not everyone will use the device like I do, I like to backup and keep lots of data on my 64GB UHS 1 SD card. This is music, images, app data etc. the speed of the card means that it is much more convenient to access and transfer data to it than a cloud based service. If you have to rely on cloud storage then that itself is a drain on battery as you have to stream data in order to use it. I myself am a huge fan of cloud storage and have 100GB+ between accounts, however I think to fully take advantage of these Android devices you should have everything you could need in one place."

I happen to quite like Sony's style,its absolutely nothing like TouchWiz. Secondly, Sony's roms are the closest to stock of any customized Android version used by any OEM that isn't just making very minor tweaks to stock (like Moto). Take a look at lollipop, the visual changes are minimal. Also, since this model is upgradable to lollipop, your talk about KitKat is kinda moot  My basic point is, please stop suggesting everyone should switch to custom roms. Quite often they're too much pain and effort for very little improvement, yet quote often with a slew of bugs. I know that it's seen as a ""master race"" thing, but really it's not for everyone."

AndroidMasterRace,3bh26k,OneplusRob,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:54:17 2015 UTC,"International Mobile Station Equipment Identity:       The International Mobile Station Equipment Identity or IMEI /aɪˈmiː/  is a number, usually unique,   to identify 3GPP (i.e., GSM, UMTS and LTE) and iDEN mobile phones, as well as some satellite phones. It is usually found printed inside the battery compartment of the phone, but can also be displayed on-screen on most phones by entering *#06# on the dialpad, or alongside other system information in the settings menu on smartphone operating systems.  The IMEI number is used by a GSM network to identify valid devices and therefore can be used for stopping a stolen phone from accessing that network. For example, if a mobile phone is stolen, the owner can call his or her network provider and instruct them to ""blacklist"" the phone using its IMEI number. This renders the phone useless on that network and sometimes other networks too, whether or not the phone's SIM is changed.  The IMEI is only used for identifying the device and has no permanent or semi-permanent relation to the subscriber. Instead, the subscriber is identified by transmission of an IMSI number, which is stored on a SIM card that can (in theory) be transferred to any handset. However, many network and security features are enabled by knowing the current device being used by a subscriber.     Relevant: Call detail record | Phone cloning | James R.

I only really use Google Maps for local bus schedules (the city provides open data for bus schedules so this could theoretically be used for local apps, but they maintain the Google data directly). The OpenStreetMap data absolutely kicks Google Map's ass what comes to walking and bicycling and sometimes store/point of interest coverage. Highway coverage is also bloody excellent. Also, OsmAnd+ does offline maps without hitches.  As far as I can tell the offline OsmAnd files get updated every 2 weeks or so. OpenStreetmappers seem to do pretty good work with constructions in urban areas. Though less so in less populated areas."

AndroidMasterRace,3b5r0h,The_D0ctah,3,Fri Jun 26 15:01:21 2015 UTC,Why are you still on KitKat?
AndroidMasterRace,3b5r0h,lirannl,3,Fri Jun 26 08:04:30 2015 UTC,AT&T hasn't gotten the update yet. I'll probably be waiting another six months to get it.
AndroidMasterRace,3b5r0h,The_D0ctah,2,Fri Jun 26 13:06:26 2015 UTC,Never bought from a carrier. Flash a carrier neutral ROM.

AndroidMasterRace,3b5r0h,Xtorting,2,Fri Jun 26 15:29:24 2015 UTC,Project ARA? I'm one of the top 17 finalist in their alpha program they had about two years ago. I go to Dev Cons in Mountain View and catalog every known and suspected company developing ARA modules within this Wiki.

He's just an articulate, minimally biased reviewer."
AndroidMasterRace,3b5r0h,El-Grunto,2,Sun Jul 5 02:28:28 2015 UTC,He said that the iPhone's camera is really good. Besides that he likes the built quality. He has never said that the OS is superior.  So idk why ppl talking shit about him. (Im not saying you are)
AndroidMasterRace,3b5r0h,Stunner07,3,Fri Jun 26 07:59:26 2015 UTC,"He uses a Mac Pro as his main PC, that's 100% a fact. But his daily driver for phones varies, as far as I know he carries around an iPhone 6 or 6+ and then whatever the newest Android phone he has is, so at this moment likely an S6 Edge or M9+. He doesn't prefer iOS to Android, he takes it on a per device basis usually. He probs prefers the i6 over the M9 but the S6 over the i6."
AndroidMasterRace,3b5r0h,OnixHF,-8,Fri Jun 26 08:03:19 2015 UTC,I hear Apple and iOS brought into the conversation like the Verge. I'm surprised so many Android fans like such a blatant Apple fan.

AndroidMasterRace,3b4trm,MonThaBiffy,2,Fri Jun 26 12:33:02 2015 UTC,"Ah, I should have specified. T-Mobile is upgrading all 2G and 3G/HSPA areas to LTE by the end of the year (as far as I know they're still on track for that). Other carriers cough Sprint cough will still have plenty of areas where they have coverage that is not LTE. T-Mobile's goal is essentially to get their whole network on to one technology stack (LTE) so that they only need to deploy one type or radio in new towers when they expand. They're the 3rd largest carrier by total number of people on the network, but they are about 30 POP behind AT&T, 100 POP behind Verizon. Sprint is pretty vague about their coverage, so I think T-Mobile is only about 10 POP behind them. Anyway, they have quite some ways to go before they have the coverage to compete with the two major carriers, and are putting a lot of effort (and money) into upgrading their network.  1 POP = 1 area populated by approximately 1 million people"

AndroidMasterRace,3aytex,otterbrine,41,Wed Jun 24 16:22:40 2015 UTC,"Bad battery life due to overkill resolution and small battery, no expandable storage, stylish edge rather than useful,  updates are slow and inconsistant (like all samsung updates atm).  Other than that it's a great well rounded phone. I just didn't want it because I'm a power user and the note 4's battery and size was what I was looking for.  Edit: also expecting to be down voted by the horde of people who have the s6. You mention one thing bad about their 700$ purchase and they get triggered."
AndroidMasterRace,3aytex,MiniMoose12,9,Wed Jun 24 16:32:32 2015 UTC,"While I agree with the edge being pointless, I got the normal S6 (never went near a Samsung device before, so I'm no fanboi) and stock, the battery life is more than adequate. It's never not lasted me a full day, even at high use. More than I can say for my old M7.  Now, I did root it two weeks ago... I'm now running it at 1080, with no real visible difference. That paired with a lightweight custom ROM and Greenify, means I can get well over 4 hours SOT and will last me through two days on the rare occasion I wasn't able to charge over night.    That said, the overly aggressive multi tasking Samsung has implemented on it is a bit annoying.   Well to be fair, I didn't notice it until it was pointed out to me, the device really does still open apps very fast anyway. But like I said once you notice it...   Chrome suffers from it the worst in my experience, mainly because it refreshes the page you're on.   And again, there are settings in the build.prop that you can change with root. The latest version of the ROM I'm running has them implemented and it's definitely improved it for me.  Overall best phone I've owed, and I've been lucky enough to get hands on with all the current flagships. I do wish I was able to flash an AOSP ROM on it though, maybe one day.  PS. Second most annoying thing: The stock alarm clock. It only has one option for snooze timings, 3 times 5 mins apart, and that's it! Even though the Note 4 (and probably others) has essentially the same app, but you can set how many times and how long you snooze for... So someone must have made a conscious decision to remove that option!? Thank god Google released their Clock app on the play store :D"
AndroidMasterRace,3aytex,saibogu009,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:49:20 2015 UTC,"The build.prop edit is a life safer for both the Note 4 and S6 at the moment, Rip Note 4 At&t models that can't root lol. Yeah your battery life is going to be slightly better running 1080p upscaled (which degrades graphic quality because it's upscaled), but no one is really going to be doing that with their s6. I can say my potato is better than yours because I stuck a Pencil in it. No one is going to stick pencils into their potatos. :D They are just going to use the potato the way it came. Compare the potato to the other potato and you have a fair argument. Both Potatoes are special and shiney lol."

Maybe if Samsung would had take example of a old Nokia N91 as it had REMOVABLE metallic backcover,  with that style s6 would have kept it's ""premium"" status and removable battery and sdcard slot.  S6 with  those modifications would have been phone that i would like,  but if s7 is like s6 (iPhone with Android) then i would rather buy some nameless Chinese copy phone than s7. If s7 is like s6 then my current s5 is going to be my last Samsung phone, well after s1, s2, s3 and now s5 i can say that I'm not going to miss Samsung's iPhones at all."

AndroidMasterRace,3aytex,njerome,11,Thu Jun 25 02:52:59 2015 UTC,"The only thing wrong with the s6 is the lack of micro sd card and slow updates. The battery life is definitely not as bad as everyone claims, I get about 5-6hours of screen on time a day. The camera is amazing (but so is the g4's, so that's not a good point).   Here are the upsides of the s6   Fingerprint scanner   Speaker not on the back   At this point in time, touch wiz is a lot less ugly than lg's skin. Lg has really dropped the ball in design.   Premium materials. Sure you can get a leather back, but there's still a lot of plastic and there's a very strange stitch down the middle of the leather back   Better screen resolution (iirc), but that's pretty much nothing, these phones have the two best screens of any smartphone   S6 has root right now, but the g4 obviously will eventually have it   Brand recognition. Stupid reason, but you will have a lot larger selection of cases and accessories specifically tailored to the s6, which is something that matters to me and a lot of people.   Really, you can't go wrong with either phone, but the s6 has more advantages over the g4"

Everyone who compared the ipad with that one noticed how laggy and crappy the galaxy tab feels compared to the ipad. Because it ran android, everybody thought android is the problem.  That's just one of those devices. Most samsung devices were laggy and sucked. Even the GS1/GS2 had problems compared to an iphone. They surely were amazing when you flashed stuff on it, but srsly, samsung fucked up.  I once met a galaxy ace user who complained about the lag. He then wanted to buy an iphone and didn't even wanted to listen that there are other phones that run android, but are smooth, and cost less than an iphone.

AndroidMasterRace,3aw4qr,wickedplayer494,3,Tue Jun 23 23:53:25 2015 UTC,"Here's my guide to how to connect to school wifi:  Step 1: if you have unlimited/a bunch (>10 GB) of mobile LTE data, DON'T.  Step 2: if you have just slightly less data, still DON'T.  Step 3: if your whatever (probably laptop) doesn't have LTE/3G capabilities, tether (using FoxFi). AKA still DON'T.  Step 4: if your whatever is not a laptop, and it doesn't have LTE/3G capabilities, go set up a wireless hotspot of your own using your phone. Then still DON'T connect to the school's, connect to your own hotspot, and make sure it's properly secured and that you only give out the password to people you trust that are also in a similar situation.  Unless it were a school issued device or a device I specifically set up knowing full well that I will expose it to it, I'd never trust school wifi. Especially if I were an iPeasant with that certificate request, ew no thanks, I'm not tossing over whole system control to you either.  It's saddening that even when some have unlimited data, they still bother with wifi even though it'd be more advantageous for them to burn their data. Almost sheep-like, alarmingly.

AndroidMasterRace,3awn5u,TheReelMVP,4,Wed Jun 24 03:23:43 2015 UTC,"I understand that liking the s6 is a very unpopular opinion on AMR. However, while the criticisms of the removal of features is fair, it is still a solid phone.    The performance of the S6 has completely dominated the competition, while upgrading the build quality of the device from the cheap plastic shit we've seen so recently. The fingerprint scanner is apparently very good, and with official support coming with Android M (eventually), this could be a very useful feature over the current flagships.   TouchWiz, still sucks, no way around it. It's hard for me to enjoy anything other than pure, glorious Android. Thankfully, if you so choose later down the road it is possible to replace it. In the meantime, a replacement launcher (Nova Launcher etc.) can help you avoid many of the frustrating features of TouchWiz, while offering  a great deal of customization.   The lack of SD card slot, and removable battery are unfortunate to say the least.   However, if you like the phone, then that's what you should get. ""together, not the same""  and all that."
AndroidMasterRace,3awn5u,Mister08,6,Wed Jun 24 18:07:27 2015 UTC,"To put it in perspective, Samsung phones are to AMR like Alienware is to PCMR. They are still good devices, but they are not the only ones and there are better options. The S6 doesn't suck and im actually considering getting one and rooting it to make sure Verizon doesn't own me. S6 is a great device!   Some good apps and stuff:   If you have a T-Mobile Unlimited texting plan, Smozzy lets you browse the web only using SMS and wont effect your data. Good for emergencies. (Cosmos browser does this to, but you have to find it on the web) We have Adblock Plus You can install Flash Player on your device to watch flash videos or play flash games. Just download Dolphin Browser and go to a flash page and it will lead you through. Steam cuz PCMR You can download Android apps from the web (extension is .APK). Most people use this to pirate paid apps, but it can let you download user-made apps and cool tweaks. S6 has a built in IR blaster. This means you can control your any device that uses an infared remote (TV, DVD Players, VCR, Projectors, Air Conditioners, etc.) with your phone. You can also troll people by turning off TVs at bars during big games or shutting the projector off at school to piss off a teacher. Lookout is a free security app that will find your device in the event you lose it, protect it from malware and do other security things You can change how your phone looks by getting custom themes and widgets Similar to jailbreak, we have root which will give you superuser power on your phone. Google is totally ok with it and apps on the Play Store can do more if your phone is rooted. Just depends on whether you feel like doing it or not. You can get a file manager to view everything on your phone and even edit apps  to get unlimited moneys You can download emulators straight from the Play Store to play your favorite handheld and console games. Don't worry, I mean the old consoles that didn't screw you over and had a lot of exclusives! If you hate the Samsung version of Android you have, you can change it to anything at all. Lets say in 5 years we have the Samsung galaxy S8 out and you still keep this phone. Samsung's version of Android might be laggy for your phone because they optimised it for the S8, you can change your OS to Cyanogenmod which will always get updates and not make your phone lag. Everything on this list is free."

Even my current Oneplus one does not have those things. The only upgrade for me would be a Nexus6.  But you are right with Samsung literally being hitler. I'm just pointing out that the GS6 sadly beats out the rest this time.  Go for the Oneplus One or the Nexus6 if you ask me.

AndroidMasterRace,3awea1,yongj1e,2,Wed Jun 24 01:55:18 2015 UTC,"most powerful device for that buck? i would say Zenfone 2, but you have to sacrifice the battery life for the performance. i have the mid end model (ZE550ML) and i would say it runs like a dream; it never lags before. it does lags in some games but that is due to Intel Atom not being fully optimized for ARM apps(future firmware updates will fix them). the battery life is pretty poor, if you actually take the 3Ah battery seriously. otherwise, it lasts a whole day on a single charge and you have to charge it everyday. and now, since Zenfone 2's bootloader is unlocked, we should be able to see custom ROMs for it in a while, and hopefully an AOSP ROM made available for Zenfone 2.  if you want battery life, OnePlus one would be good to go. however, i would advise you to wait for OnePlus two as it would be released in a few months or so. it would be faster than the Zenfone 2, but i believe it'd be tough to get one and it would be more expensive than the highest end model Zenfone 2. it should be under $300 though."

The changes will take place immediately on boot. You don't need to calibrate your battery for your kernel or anything like that (they are phone specific=Battery is the same Value). When you flash a kernel, you want to check your wifi, text, call, basically every essential feature. Kernels can be incompatible with certain roms etc. I've seen people flash Note 4 Kernels, but it wasn't for their modem so they loss all internet connection services like 4G or wifi. Anyways, kernels can do some fun stuff. For the note4 you can chance minimum cpu frequencies and Storage handling to improve battery life etc.(depending on the model). Overall, kernel changes have their pros and cons. Mostly pros if you choose a good one (if there is one for your phone) :D"

It's worth noting that a packet of noodles is not supposed to be an entire meal, it is supposed to just be a side, so having an entire packet as an entire meal is not that bad, because you're not having anything else with it. Also, as you can see with the recommended daily allowance percentages, salt is really the worst part about noodles and that's all in the flavour sachet, so just use half the flavour and you'll only be getting one serving's worth of salt."

AndroidMasterRace,3as558,lazyslacker,0,Tue Jun 23 21:19:25 2015 UTC,"Ok, sorry. I'm frustrated with the state of american healthcare, healthcare awareness and nutrition awareness.  I used to live in Korea. In Korea, their equivalent of the FDA requires that the total amount of calories contained in every retail packaged food be prominently displayed on the front of the package. For example, a bag of chips might show on the front, next to the weight, ""900 kcal"". (They use the term kilocalories in Korea, as it's more technically correct, but it's the same as what we call calories).   I think this labeling policy alone, if adopted by the FDA, would do wonders to help people understand the nutrition in their food and count their calories better. No multiplication or division needed, no reading of the fine print, just look at the front of the package. If, for example, you eat half the package, you've eaten half of that number of calories shown on the label. It's much simpler than forcing the consumer to figure it out on their own, measuring out their serving size, and potentially having to multiply by a number of servings per container that's not even a whole number.   Michelle Obama may be making significant strides in areas like school lunches, but I think simple regulation changes like this one would help out far more people far better."

But I have gotten multiple craigslist phones (htc sensation, nexus 4, Galaxy s4, lg g3,, and note 3) and they've been great. Always a word of advice with craigslist, do the transaction in your carrier's store as you could have someone there confirm it's not blocked and get your sim changed there and then."

AndroidMasterRace,3avebx,Moynia,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:17:53 2015 UTC,"what you have to do is find a nexus 6 that is factory SIM unlocked and it will work. the sim slot sizes are different, but you can always just either cut the sim card (if it's too big) or put it into an adapter (if it's too small.)  so yes, as long as the phone is unlocked, and the sim card fits, you're good to go."
AndroidMasterRace,3avp8c,pizzahippie,7,Tue Jun 23 21:47:57 2015 UTC,"Xperia Z3 or Z3 compact, hell a Z2 is also a good choice. If you want a very new device I'd recommend a Galaxy S6 Active, just need to check if it can run on your carrier.  Edit: Sorry, didn't read that you have a budget of under 250. The best option would be as /u/AlexLam24 said, get a first-gen Moto G and an Otterbox case. The only problem is that the camera is not great, but for under 250 you probably won't find phones with a great camera."
AndroidMasterRace,3avp8c,hiredantispammer,2,Wed Jun 24 00:16:06 2015 UTC,LG G2 can be had for cheap....
AndroidMasterRace,3avp8c,MegaRingstar,4,Wed Jun 24 13:39:28 2015 UTC,You're not gonna find a phone close to that for 250. Closest is maybe an s5 if you get lucky

AndroidMasterRace,3avaoq,AshTheGoblin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:42:38 2015 UTC,Would a faulty port also cause the phone to switch from charging to not charging even when there is no cord plugged in?
AndroidMasterRace,3avaoq,AshTheGoblin,2,Tue Jun 23 22:01:01 2015 UTC,Yep. I had these kinds of issues when I still had a Galaxy S III. The issue came from using the phone too much while plugged in. Also from keeping the phone on my bed while I slept. (I would roll over onto it while it was charging)

AndroidMasterRace,3av3uo,AttemptedWit,3,Tue Jun 23 22:32:58 2015 UTC,"Google keyboard and Swiftkey are probably the best, though neither are perfect. Swiftkey is a battery hog but you can train it to be super accurate, while Google keyboard is better on the battery but you can't remove predictions that you would never EVER use.  I find the prediction or the use of the space bar and periods to be too annoying on other keyboards to be really useful by comparison."

AndroidMasterRace,3aqfen,MakoMoogle,4,Mon Jun 22 20:34:10 2015 UTC,Nope no slow down. I uploaded it to YouTube to convert it to a  imgur gif. So maybe that messed with the video fps idk.
AndroidMasterRace,3aqfen,hiredantispammer,3,Mon Jun 22 20:26:14 2015 UTC,Well it plays at 30 fps on the ps4 doesn't it?
AndroidMasterRace,3aqfen,MakoMoogle,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:33:51 2015 UTC,It plays at 60 fps.
AndroidMasterRace,3aqfen,hiredantispammer,2,Tue Jun 23 07:44:45 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I looked on YouTube. It hovers about 55 and sometimes hits 60, and dips as low as 45. That's actually not bad for the hardware that it has, though it is 900p. I can see why they didn't do 1080p, would have been unplayable."
AndroidMasterRace,3aqfen,MakoMoogle,2,Tue Jun 23 08:28:05 2015 UTC,"I'll choose 900p@60 fps over 1080p@<60 fps in a competitive game anyway.

Not a fanboy of anything, but PC is definitely the superior platform."
AndroidMasterRace,3aqfen,Racoonie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:40:11 2015 UTC,"Yeh PC is the best no doubt, definitely for FPS too, though we can use an Xbox controller for other games anyway. I'll probably be picking up a second hand PS4 for FF7 in couple of years time but I can't see myself seriously ever using consoles again after that. I moved off consoles after selling my PS3, and my 360 is collecting dust, it just after that I can't see any point, most games are multi plat anyway, the new consoles are weak, the games are expensive, there's not a lot of game on consoles as it is, and paying to play online is a joke. Personally, I don't see it being worth it. To top it off, 3rd party games and content is being held hostage in a horrible anti-consumer way just to entice people to buying hardware no one really needs, so I'm reluctant to give any money to Sony or MS."

AndroidMasterRace,3aqfen,Himiko_the_sun_queen,3,Mon Jun 22 21:16:21 2015 UTC,I find that PS3/PS4 controllers work the best since they have Bluetooth and aren't too expensive.

AndroidMasterRace,3atr3b,PantsOfAwesome,21,Tue Jun 23 13:08:26 2015 UTC,"I have a stock N6 and haven't experienced anything like that. Honestly I would factory reset and look for a rogue app possibly causing problems.  Edit: On second thought, After reading OPs comment about running a custom rom and kernel, I think OP should flash back to stock. The problems are probably stemming from whatever has been flashed.   Having all those problems on stock firmware is 1 thing, but the moment you decide to start flashing zips its all on you."

Do you think that your phone will still have good battery life for a couple years?
AndroidMasterRace,3atr3b,strngsvlmstng96,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:26:15 2015 UTC,"I have had my previous phone for more than two years, with worse charging habits than I have now.

AndroidMasterRace,3atr3b,qlester,3,Wed Jun 24 21:23:57 2015 UTC,"Because I've tried three different roms, a new kernel, and I flashed back to stock yesterday and I'm still not pleased with this phone. If I can find a reason to still like Android, I may get a Note 5, but I just feel like I made a huge mistake getting a Nexus 6. The main reason I'm considering an iPhone is because I found that I don't really use most of the customization features that Android offers, I don't really ever change anything other than the wallpaper. With an iPhone, I'll have everything I need, and I'll just be happy with the smoothness of iOS. Also, most of my friends use iPhones, so I can finally use iMessage and Facetime with them."

If you try an iPhone and find that you like it better than Android, then great, you've found your platform.  You could just try another ROM, though.

The Nexus 6 has a very good battery and you should easily be getting 3 hours of screen on time. My friend has a Nexus 6 and I can tell you it not only should have great battery life, but it's incredibly smooth too.   I think you should flash back to stock and see if that will help with anything. I can help if you need it.

Of course Google excels in services, not hardware. So I have the iPad loaded up with tons of Google apps lol.  An iPhone is looking really good right now.

I still have an S1 with Cyanogenmod  11, yes it's slow, but everything on it works and even on it's stock ROM it still had a freaking FILE BROWSER! Not to mention the price of an iPhone, for 800 bucks it's not supposed to ""Just work"", it's supposed to fly to the moon! People always like to say that it's a matter of preference and honestly I don't see how, Android is better in literally every way so how can it come to preference if one is obviously better? Do people enjoy having bad products which they pay a lot for? Oh yeah and did I mention, my S1 doesn't bend XD"

As for your question, Android apps are written in Java and they can have specific parts in C++. If you are new to programming/game development first learn Java and don't bother about C++ it's only important for high-end games. After you know Java well look at some game programming introductions as game development is really different from normal app development.

That's why when you move a webpage around in safari, it doesn't load as all processing power is on how pretty it looks. Android does both, so on a high end phone it will be faster. Also android covers a wide range of phones, so it is retarded to say ""android is slower lol"" when budget phones bring it down    ""android"" is cheaper than ""Apple""  √  And that's why we get more bang for our buck, we get more hardware for the same price m8-y! The same cannot be said for you iplebbles!    better performance faster performance  X  nope, see above, also IOS apps hide behind a splash screen when loading, because ios & iPhones arent fast enough to load it all in one!    easier to use  X  You obviously haven't used a android device, have you?    better than Samsung  X  Samsung != android, and their phones are most definitely better than your iShit.     [garbled rubbish about holograms]   X  Samsung didn't ""invent"" holograms, and even if apple did put that tech in their phones, it would be 3-4 years behind like it usually is.

If this really is the solution to ""fix"" the out of box experience, then Android phones should come with a sticker that says ""Prerequisite for buying: Knowledge to using the command line"" * It voids your warranty.

AndroidMasterRace,3adnnx,GrayBoltWolf,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:16:07 2015 UTC,It was Apple's fault. Their servers didn't block a user that entered a password incorrectly a certain number of times so hackers just brute forced their way in.
AndroidMasterRace,3adnnx,Vengapoon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:59:23 2015 UTC,"Wasn't the whole thing that it was a hack from icloud? If that isn't what happened, than that's what the media said at least. For the amount of people who's pictures were leaked, than that would be a hell of a lot of work to be able to get every one of their passwords without using some sort of tool, so I kinda side more with the""hacking"" idea. Also, even if it was just a ton of social engineering, than it would still be insecure. Google sends you a email whenever your account is logged in to by a unrecognised device, so if Apple was as secure, than the victims should have been able to put a stop to the it before they were leaked (if the pictures weren't all acquired at once like you said). Regardless, if that many people got their pictures stolen, it ends up being a security issue. That shouldn't be able to happen and if it does, then the blame falls on the company that let the security issue go unnoticed. ICloud therefore is not secure, or at least not as secure as it should be."

AndroidMasterRace,3aciqc,amdc,2,Fri Jun 19 22:19:11 2015 UTC,Because phones got bigger with more power. Obviously that means less battery life

Only because you're retarded as hell. My Grandad got an iFad update and it made it slower, last shorter on a full battery charge and generally fuck with his apps as he is deaf and needs to use Facetime etc to communicate with friends. Also as my whole family are a bunch of iShills, they keep getting problems. I don't have to update...so I don't wake up with my alarm reset or with half my apps/data gone because of an unwanted update.

AndroidMasterRace,3aayc7,Degru,2,Fri Jun 19 06:51:37 2015 UTC,"It does have one point, though. Android is very fragmented in terms of which devices have the latest update available even if they are able to run it just fine, and the ones that do get it often get it months after release."
AndroidMasterRace,3aayc7,zNiiC,2,Fri Jun 19 21:12:08 2015 UTC,"Both iOS 9 and Android M share one major new feature: NFC-enabled contactless payments.   No. This is not new for M. This is new for iOS. Google Wallet has been around since 2011. Android Pay is just a new framework for nfc payments.   It will be a while. (And you will need a handset that includes NFC, which is by no means a given.)   What? Basically every android comes with nfc   as well as those of the world's 17 Windows Phone users with Cortana   Is this guy being paid to take shots at devices that aren't iPhones?   Split-screen multitasking is part of iOS 9, too and there's a picture-in-picture mode that lets you watch videos while you do other things. These features will be okay on an iPhone, and great on an iPad.   Isn't this only available on iPads? I know the TRUE multitasking is only available for the air 2 (lol).   In iOS 9 Apple also offers a software-based battery-saving mode. Apple says this feature should give up to three hours of extra use   So like Android L?   Again, the challenge for Google is that each Android phone and tablet has both different hardware and software modified by the manufacturer, so it is difficult to see how it can make such a claim.   Because all wakelocks are the same (hence the device going into deep sleep)? Easy to hibernate them if they have the same name. Android L's battery saver basically does what iOS 9's does (underclock cpu, disable animations).  This ""journalism"" thing (or whatever you call it) is such a joke."
AndroidMasterRace,3aayc7,NnifWald,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:09:35 2015 UTC,We do know what phones it will run on. iOS isn't the only OS with constant devices. Google releases new Nexus devices each year with the new version of Android just like Apple releases a new iPhone each year with each version of iOS.

Initially, I thought it was the hub, so I connected straight to the computer, and when it didn't work, I tried another USB cable. When that worked, I threw away that cable (when in reality, I should have saved it and used it as a charging only cable in my car)."

AndroidMasterRace,3ad2xy,kushxmaster,3,Fri Jun 19 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"The main thing is there's a few more options you get with jailbreaking vs using vanilla android but vanilla android has many of the same features that are a main reason people jailbreak. Not to mention there's no guarantee that jailbreak will even happen when ios gets updated so I don't think saying you can jailbreak is a valid argument because you can't always and the latest version of the system usually patches whatever bug or exploit they used previously. That's not the case for vanilla android.   I mean, to each their own but to me it just doesn't make sense to buy an iPhone just to jailbreak to get most of the stuff that comes stock on Android."
AndroidMasterRace,3ad2xy,kushxmaster,0,Fri Jun 19 05:54:52 2015 UTC,"I mean, to each their own but to me it just doesn't make sense to buy an iPhone just to jailbreak to get most of the stuff that comes stock on Android.   But I'm not talking about buying an iphone, I'm talking about the OS, only the OS. I get your point about the jailbreak not always being available. But you are saying that android is better because you can do more without having to ""jailbreak"" it?  So you think that it is better because it can do almost as much as a jailbroken iphone? But I don't get it because a jailbroken iphone can do a little more than vanilla android so it is technically better? Is it just your opinion or is there something I don't get?"
AndroidMasterRace,3ad2xy,deftdrummer,2,Fri Jun 19 12:06:06 2015 UTC,"Lol, damn. Let me make it simpler for you.   Yes, jailbroken ios has a couple things vanilla android doesn't have. No it doesn't make it better because it's easier to root android than it is to jailbreak ios. Also, Jailbreaking ios has been know to cause tons of issues for people, not the case for Android.   You really can't compare jailbroken ios to android at all because there's no guarantee you'll ever be able to jailbreak the current ios. I mean, they don't even have jailbreak for 8.3 and they are saying if there is it won't be til next month and maybe it won't even get released...how is it going to be better if you can't even jailbreak it? Not to mention ios 9 is due later this year. How long to 8 take to jailbreak? Get ready for that kind of wait again. Meanwhile, android M preview has been rooted since day one.   And it all comes down to whether or not you'll actually be able to root or not. I don't see jailbroken ios vs vanilla android being a fair comparison, but if I had to choose between the two I would still pick an unrooted android over jailbroken ios. Want to know why? Root/jailbreak might get you themes and ad block and stuff like that, but android is a more capable system to begin with and I'd take that any day over a theme or ad block.   What makes you want to jailbreak your ios so bad? Chances are that feature can be done with an android phone out of the box.   Like I said though, to each their own."

If not he sure is going an awful good job at ""not getting it"" and making it into a preference war.   The basics: Android is like Pandora's box when it comes to 'doing things' - meaning if you can think it up there's likely an app / service / theme / workaround to achieve said result.   Compare that to the iPhone and it is simply a box. It has apps, it has a homescreen - yet your perceived options are nowhere near as abundant as they are on Android."

There are no custom ROMS on iOS, iOS is a closed-source operating system. Therefore nobody can create a modified version of iOS. On the other hand, Android is open-source thus it is easy to create numerous spinoffs, each with its unique qualities."

AndroidMasterRace,3ad2xy,Kaustikos,3,Fri Jun 19 12:38:47 2015 UTC,"No. What you don't understand is that a ROM is an operating system, an android spinoff if you will. It'll wipe your current operating system, and add a new one. Android with a different variety of options and customizations, every ROM is different. Installing Cydia (jailbreaking) on iOS and downloading apps from it or theme-ing it with winterboard? (that's what it was when I last used iOS) isn't the same as installing a different operating system. Anymore questions? : )"
AndroidMasterRace,3ad2xy,Kaustikos,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:45:46 2015 UTC,"Jailbreaking isn't just ""installing cydia"", it frees the phone completly. So if somebody found a way to program a new iphone OS, wouldn't it be technically possible to install it on a jailbroken iphone?"
AndroidMasterRace,3ad2xy,knuckles1978,2,Fri Jun 19 17:46:43 2015 UTC,"From what I used on iOS 4 to iOS 6.1.3, when you jailbroke your phone it would install an app called Cydia, which you can only achieve by jailbreaking your device. You couldn't do anything else without going through Cydia first. And jailbreaking doesn't free the phone completely, there are still restrictions. Can you overclock your iPhones CPU with jailbreak? No (or at least I strongly doubt it). Can you overclock your android phone's CPU with root? Yes.  You won't 'find' a way to program a new OS for iPhone, it's closed-source. Its source code is not out to the public, therefore a customized version of it cannot be created. I would bet there's some code or whatever in the phone to check if the OS is genuine. Even if you did somehow create a modified version, which isn't possible, what the chances it would even run on every device? 0. It would need to be device specific. Even then it wouldn't even need to be jailbroken in the first place, you'd just be installing unofficial firmware. Quite the fickle matter which'll never happen. Anything else you don't understand?"

AndroidMasterRace,3a1qcf,zpepsin,7,Tue Jun 16 15:29:24 2015 UTC,"Here's how I made the ""sticky"" widget:  Nova Launcher (not sure if you need prime for this, but I have it). Set the desktop scroll effect to ""Wipe"" and turn infinite scroll on. Then arranged the icons on each screen to all be on the same grid spaces. Then put your widget (in this case I used a clock widget from Zooper Widget) on each screen in the same exact place.  This combination gives it the illusion that the widget is ""sticky"" on the screen and doesn't move.  In reality, it is actually ""Wiping"" to the widget on the next screen, which is in the exact same place.  So you don't visually see the change."

But here's one of the beautiful things about Android: You get to pick the one you like! Instead of Apple telling you what you are supposed to like, you get to choose for yourself. Also, everyone is going to have a different opinion because of that. Don't let that scare you off."
AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,jonnyhuu,7,Tue Jun 16 04:46:00 2015 UTC,"If you really want to enjoy and feel Android, buy Google phone that is Nexus 6 because you get stock Android in it. Other companies has mix like HTC has Android and HTC sense."

AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,gthing,4,Tue Jun 16 02:58:08 2015 UTC,"Hey! Take a loot at the Galaxy Note 4! It has expandable storage, removable battery, metal design, and a beautiful screen. You can usually grab an unlocked one for ~500$ if you're lucky. I love mine, it's big and the S-pen makes writing on it a dream. And even if you don't write, the pen hides away inside the phone. It's a very premium design and I love every part about it."
AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,MiniMoose12,-5,Tue Jun 16 00:35:03 2015 UTC,$400 on ebay as recently as last week. A beautiful phone if you don't care about having a cellular connection or a working GPS.

AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,slayerbrk,5,Tue Jun 16 03:20:49 2015 UTC,"Once a week, works fine. Use it on long trips to themeparks or obscure places I don't already know. It's accurate and updates just like any other iphone or android I've used.(iphone 4, s4, s5, firephone, etc.) Just because you're having an issue doesn't mean the entire phone line has it. Battery life and bugs have been wide spread but are caused by many different factors. You could have just got a bad phone. Every production line will have a mistake. Literally shitting about it on reddit won't solve anything. You should've noticed that issue and returned or exchanged your phone. Samsung has a 1 year warranty for a reason. Just like any other smart phone you'll ever purchase, defects are inevitable."
AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,slayerbrk,2,Tue Jun 16 04:39:22 2015 UTC,"As they said the note 4 is a great choice with the S6 being a great alternative if you don't like the size.

AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,LastReach,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:00:49 2015 UTC,as other users said you can also chnage the launcher instead of the whole rom and just disable all the bs apps that come on the phone.

AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,starfire221,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:23:39 2015 UTC,"It's a good phone, its just I expected greatness.  Battery life- horrible I'm a type of person who literally has something happening on my phone all the time. Screen on time was between 2 to 3 hours with the brightness down about 1/4 way the bar.   I seemed to have connectivity problems sometimes, I say seemed because the phone would hang when making a phone call or throw me off lte and stay on h+. A reboot would usually fix this.  And finally the camera is also horrible, I'm not someone that takes a bunch of pictures but I do expect the few pictures I take to look decent and that thing just completely fell flat.  There's a few other things that buged me but they weren't major  Like:       The pink hue of the screen when turned all the way down.       The ota update that made the phone think I had my face on it when in a phone call which made it so that I couldn't hang up.        And the speakers are lack luster they're either too quiet or  too loud don't really have middle ground.   The phone is fine if not good. But I expected better from both Motorola and Google, especially since the nexus line up is supposed to be what manufacture's aim for.  I think that if you got it when on sale its worth it but it is not worth the 600 bucks I got it for, at least not to me."
AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,Eziel,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:54:36 2015 UTC,"Damn. I thought I did my research on it. I currently have an S5 but it's going through some issues (fault on my part) but I love this phone. I got the Nexus 6 because of Google Fi, but I'll switch back if anything. Thank you."

AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,bluestaplerman,2,Tue Jun 16 06:49:08 2015 UTC,"Galaxy s6. I switched from iPhone a couple weeks ago and it is a great phone. It's been responsive for me, has arguably the best camera on a smartphone currently (pretty much tied with the LG G4) and it feels great. If I could go back and choose a phone again, I'd go right back with the s6. And if you don't like touchwiz, there are plenty of third party launchers to make the experience whatever you want it to be."
AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,djdanlib,5,Mon Jun 15 22:59:03 2015 UTC,"I second this. Reddit likes to hate Samsung, but they make nice phones."
AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,jamesick,3,Tue Jun 16 04:50:06 2015 UTC,"sorry, but being new to the androidmarket, what is touchwiz?"
AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,jld2k6,6,Mon Jun 15 23:05:13 2015 UTC,"TouchWiz is the Samsung skin. There is stock Android which you get on nexus phones, but the manufacturers put a skin over android to change the experience for the user while keeping it customizable. But if you don't like the skin you can download a custom launcher which changes the experience since you can't easily remove the skins from phones. One of the more popular launcher is nova which is what I use but there are plenty to choose from if you don't like the look or ui of your phone"
AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,Aaron_Watson,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:16:15 2015 UTC,"For an example of how dramatically a manufacturer can skin the whole UI, just look at an HTC phone."

AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,jld2k6,5,Tue Jun 16 07:41:56 2015 UTC,"Touchwiz is not a launcher or a skin. The person explaining Touchwiz to you is absolutely wrong and you should not listen to them. Touchwiz is Samsung's own modified version of android. It cannot be fixed by switching launchers because it is its own separate ROM with its own firmware. I'm not sure how so many people think this. Touchwiz sucks to deal with if you don't like it because it's Samsung's version of android that they heavily modified and the only way to get ""off"" Touchwiz is to unlock your bootloader and flash to a different ROM."
AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,creativecactus,2,Tue Jun 16 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"Touchwiz is Samsung modified version of Android and it is what runs on a Samsung device. Go to your local Best Buy and try out an S6, everything you're interacting with on it is TW."
AndroidMasterRace,39ywll,jonnyhuu,0,Tue Jun 16 01:50:33 2015 UTC,"If you really want to ascend further into the master race, you can get rid of touchwiz altogether by rooting your phone and flashing a custom ROM. The ROM is literally the operating system of the phone, so when you install a custom one, it has sooo many new and different features that you can't find on other phones. (except phones that have the same ROM.) anyway, as a new user, custom ROMs probably won't be for you, but i know that custom ROMs alone make android devices superior to any other iOS device.   but yeah, as far as your concern for a new phone go, the galaxy s6 and HTC one M9 will suit your needs. the HTC desire eye is a little intriguing, but galaxy s6 has the best camera. if you ever look into rooting and ROMs, there are tons of tutorials everywhere. just look and ask around :)"

It might be because Samsung also names their launcher Touchwiz but that is not what Touchwiz is. The Touchwiz launcher is just Touchwiz' launcher if that makes sense. Its kind of like if android decided to name their launcher android. You aren't getting off android by changing your launcher. You're just changing androids default launcher. Your whole operating system on stock Samsung is Touchwiz.

It's another xposed module. In case you haven't heard of it, it hibernates the apps you choose when you're not using them so they don't run in the background wasting battery when not in use. I got 7 hours screen on time with 25% of my battery left the other day on my s5 with Greenify alone and no power saving settings :o I'm not sure if that's good for a Note 4 but it is great for the s5 ;) it's a nifty app"

You can certainly achieve much more and have probably around the same standby time on other phones without ever modifying it, but the battery life on the Edge on Lollipop is just awful, really, really bad. After 5 hours with maybe 15 mins screen on time my Edge was almost always at 50%, so this is a massive improvement.

AndroidMasterRace,39qytv,Cspartan007,2,Sun Jun 14 09:06:00 2015 UTC,Coverage seems pretty similar to ATT which I was previously on. The nice part is the WiFi calling so in places where I don't have coverage I usually have WiFi (In my basement for example). I don't know how I feel about being locked to using Nexus devices but I'm on my second Nexus as a daily driver so its no big deal. The Fi app is really nice and easy to use and the price for Fi is great.
AndroidMasterRace,39qytv,Cspartan007,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:11:38 2015 UTC,I thought Google Fi was supposed to work along with your existing plan... How much does it cost?

AndroidMasterRace,39qytv,ericnichols1999,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:25:42 2015 UTC,"Pretty good, I don't notice a huge difference over AT&T. The WiFi calling is nice for when I am in a place with no coverage (I have a lake house out in the middle of the Adirondacks that never gets any coverage on AT&T or on Fi but it has WiFi so I am still able to make calls and text.) The Fi app is really nice and easy to use. The roaming rates are amazing, and the price per Gb is also much better than AT&T, plus there is no throttling or extra charges for going over your plan (Flat 10$ per Gb no matter what)."
AndroidMasterRace,39qytv,deimosian,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:11:56 2015 UTC,That sounds pretty nice... I don't have a nexus 6 yet but should I wait until the new nexus comes out and get Fi or get the nexus 6 when I get my invite?

Profitable, like a fashion accessory.  Then in 2007 by paying for $599 the iPhone 8GB and 24 months at a minimum of $60 a month but you're cool so more like $100+, but it's slow you'll need a laptop...  Diversity?

AndroidMasterRace,39lwis,ElDubardo,42,Fri Jun 12 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"Dude, the NFC works without an app. It's build into Android. And I think everyone has a qr code scanner on their phone."
AndroidMasterRace,39lwis,ElDubardo,42,Fri Jun 12 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"NFC yeah but the QR, not me or my roms."
AndroidMasterRace,39lwis,Zankou55,25,Fri Jun 12 20:46:38 2015 UTC,I find qr extremely useful. For example I have a browser plugin to quickly open a website on my phone. The public transportation in my city has a qr code each stop. Upon scanning it opens the app or the mobile website and the start point is already filled out.
AndroidMasterRace,39lwis,TheBullshitPatrol,10,Fri Jun 12 20:52:52 2015 UTC,Link to the browser plug in?

AndroidMasterRace,39lwis,Headshot_,2,Sat Jun 13 07:19:48 2015 UTC,"I'm with the others. Don't ever use QR and don't have a scanner app on my phone. For the purpose you're talking about my chrome browser just syncs across all my devices that uses chrome. Before that I'd just use chrome2phone (or I think that's the name). Pressing the button on my browser to push the webpage to my phone was much easier and takes way less steps to accomplish what your goal is, so I'm curious, why use your method (the QR codes for websites, that is)?"

AndroidMasterRace,39lwis,thijsrico,17,Fri Jun 12 18:36:19 2015 UTC,Jupp that's it. I used a very cheap 256k tag I taped on the back of the sheet. To be sure that old lg phones including the nexus 4 can read it.
AndroidMasterRace,39lwis,theodopolis13,3,Fri Jun 12 19:39:24 2015 UTC,I'm wondering how we can do this using NFC.
AndroidMasterRace,39lwis,thijsrico,2,Sat Jun 13 05:00:40 2015 UTC,"Do you mean how to write the tag or how I put the tag on the back of the sheet?  If it's the first one then:   With Android L, you have to be connected to the WiFi, then go to settings>WiFi longpress the ssid and select ""write to NFC"". You need to reenter the pw and then put your phone on an empty tag. That's it.  If it's the second:  http://www.amazon.de/gp/aw/d/B00BTKAI7U/"

AndroidMasterRace,39lwis,LiamBaby,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:37:34 2015 UTC,"if an iPhone reads it, it shows the wifi password.   Well, the pre-share key is supposed to be encoded in the QR code anyway - if the reader application shows it, it's the application's fault.  (Edit: Barcode Scanner for Android also shows the password. Not in the scanning screen, but it will if you go to the history.)   Not very secure if you don't want to give passwords out.   If your network is based on PSK, then you really have no other option - one way or other, you need to give the PSK to the people who want to use the network, and since you're putting the password on their devices, you have no guarantees they won't be peeking at it. If you don't want to share passwords, there are other Wi-Fi encryption methods that use different forms of authentication, but they're a bit more difficult to set up."
AndroidMasterRace,39osk0,hiredantispammer,10,Sat Jun 13 08:48:11 2015 UTC,Realistically I think they should have the S805.  Unrealistically I think they should have the Exynos 7420.
AndroidMasterRace,39osk0,GalaxicXperiaM8,5,Sat Jun 13 13:13:22 2015 UTC,Why not the 808?
AndroidMasterRace,39osk0,Santa_Cow,6,Sat Jun 13 14:07:16 2015 UTC,A) has been specifically optimised by Qualcomm for the G4  B) has a worse GPU apparently
AndroidMasterRace,39osk0,GalaxicXperiaM8,6,Sat Jun 13 14:13:02 2015 UTC,Seems like the 805 is the only realistic choice then :(
AndroidMasterRace,39osk0,Santa_Cow,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:22:03 2015 UTC,Yup. Hopefully the 820 or whatever the next one is doesn't have the same problems.
AndroidMasterRace,39osk0,GalaxicXperiaM8,8,Sat Jun 13 14:29:07 2015 UTC,I had the m9 for a while. I traded it for a gs6 for other reasons. It isn't as bad as people say. It is throttled like crazy but it still performs as well as an 805. And the adreno 430 is a monster especially with 1080p displays. It beats iPhone level on screen performance. That's said I would've rather seen a 7420 for obvious reasons but that would never happen. To be realistic an 805 would've been ideal. Still a monster gpu and cpu.
AndroidMasterRace,39osk0,sidharth762,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:33:45 2015 UTC,"Snapdragon 808/805, it performs better since it doesn't throttle at every chance it gets."
