I mean, there've been rumblings for a while, but he's very touchy feely, and puts his arm around every single one of his woman friends. And if it's a casual relationship that he doesn't mention in interviews then I figure I don't need to know about it.   Oh yeah, and I'm totally fine with people expressing sadness.

There's always a chance it's just part of their Oscars campaign, of course: but I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for now."

tomhiddleston,3e28gq,cordialoffendress,11,Wed Jul 22 07:14:54 2015 UTC,I knew it would only be a matter of time before I ran across something like this. I can't be obsessively checking for new info on the man and not expect to discover this. (Though I'm apparently late to the party?) The rational part of my brain says: 'he's just a man...he deserves his privacy...he deserves to be happy...can't expect the man to be celibate...none of my business...etc.' So why do I feel a little sick?
tomhiddleston,3e28gq,loubric,10,Tue Jul 21 12:14:00 2015 UTC,"You feel sick because he is, still, a crush by definition. One-sided love is always painful, regardless of whether the person is technically ""attainable"" (i.e. someone you know IRL), a stranger or a celebrity. I'm sorry you feel this way, and I wish I could think of something to say that would make you feel better; but really, the only thing that heals heartache is time."

I am a married, well-adjusted (I think) adult who just has a crush on an actor. I'm even a little embarrassed to admit it to strangers on the internet, but I honestly had no control over my body's initial reaction of nausea and face-flushing. I just need a few days to let this settle and I'll be back to drooling over the new set of pictures from wherever he shows up next :)  You guys are the only ones I have to talk about these crazy things."

Tom is my first celebrity crush in almost two decades - not because I actually, seriously want to marry him, but because he's sexy and fun and intelligent and just a big bag full of goodies:))) it's just a pleasure to watch someone who is a natural-born entertainer. And if Elizabeth makes him even happier, it can only serve to enhance my fangirl experience:)"
tomhiddleston,3e28gq,doctor_forgetful,4,Tue Jul 21 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"If he's happy, that's great. He deserves it. Honestly, the only opinions that matter on this are his and Elizabeth's.

tomhiddleston,3e28gq,sageicedragonx,8,Tue Jul 21 15:48:57 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad. Really, like Sister says, I think the vast majority of us (in here, at least, not speaking to the rest of the Internet) are rational, ""normal"" adults who have meaningful relationships and lives; we just happen to have a big  little crush on a man who has some fantastic attributes. Hell, I get real life crushes on people sometimes. I'm very happily married but I always say ""I'm married, not blind/dead."" Anyway, all this is to say that a little gut punch is normal, because the whole fantasy of the crush is that said person remains single and yours for the taking, KWIM? The very fact that you're logical enough to realize that your reaction makes you feel weird means you'll be perfectly fine. :)"
tomhiddleston,3e28gq,mandym347,6,Tue Jul 21 14:15:59 2015 UTC,"Married here too and I have a total crush on Tom, it's totally normal for us to want our celebrity crushes to stay single, that way there is still ""hope"" even if we know it could never happen :)   PS. you're not crazy ;)"

tomhiddleston,3e28gq,seraphire,6,Tue Jul 21 15:41:42 2015 UTC,"There is no way a man like that is celibate. Even the best of us can't hold out forever. But he does seem discreet so I'm curious where this will go. They are 8 years apart. That's a huge gap in life experiences and personal growth as far as I can see. It's not dramatically huge, but it can get in the way. I've seen large age gap relationships. Either they work just fine because both are mature enough to handle it or one ends up patronizing the other for being too young/old.  Either way I'm happy for them if it turns into something. He deserves happiness, but he seems like a man that enjoys working a lot. Maybe he will dial it back for this."
tomhiddleston,3e28gq,tritonoftheminnows,5,Tue Jul 21 13:12:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, age gaps get less and less problematic the older you get, and individual maturity always makes a big difference."
tomhiddleston,3e28gq,firemaple,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:19:22 2015 UTC,Oh yeah for sure. A couple who is 40 and 50 has less issues than one that is 20 to 30. Because most of your maturity growth seems like it ranges between 20-40 after your initial independence from parental influence. Depending on what you do after that is how fast you grow in that time period and where your personality ends up settling. I know I've mellowed out a lot since I was in my early 20s and do a lot more now than before. Things don't phase me as much because I just don't take a lot personally anymore.
tomhiddleston,3e28gq,unpopularOpinion123,2,Wed Jul 22 14:08:59 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about the age gap as well.

The shower was very sweet and pleasant and right up there in the top five of places where I literally do not belong.  Over thirty women of varying ages in this church room, all very devout, and one outlier (you can guess who at this point) that tends to stink of incense and heresy who was then hoping that the place might at least not burst into in flames because she was there.  Very nice people.  Just so awkward.  Still find it weird that my sister and I get along.  On the sliding scale of extremes, she's at the outgoing, pleasant, bubbly end, and I fell off the other."

The last one I attended was for a friend expecting her second, thrown by another friend also expecting her second. All the other guests except one had small children with them. That one other person and I clung to each other like the waters were rising and we were waiting for the Ark, because two childless women in mid twenties is a rare species indeed in that area, it seemed."

My SIL's congregation is on the sane side of Quiverful, so there were a lot of baby bumps and weirdly overdone glorification of the whole process.  I spent a lot of time with the rest of my in-laws, who are occasionally weirder than me.  My mother in law pretty much saves any occasion by being a nut drawn to awkward situations - at one point my SIL opened up a baby book about bunnies and my mother looks at the woman across from her at the table and just blurts:  ""Thank GOODNESS it wasn't the Velveteen Rabbit! I hate that book!""  The lady just sort of stares back through the sealed gates of Hell.  ""...I got her that book.""  slow, horrified gasp from my MIL.  I love my mother in law."

It helps that a lot of characters managed to (mostly) have adult, reasonable conversations about reasonable things when it counted.  That the broad tropes weren't all the really terrible ones.

I think it had to do with just the short distant flight and the time, gas it took to just leap frog to your destination. It doesn't take that long from London to Dublin right? That is my only theory."
tomhiddleston,3dx7h1,cordialoffendress,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:47:20 2015 UTC,Nope really short just an hour thirty.  You go up then you come right back down almost.  The train is two hours I think from dub to bel but I guess being American we just always think of trains as a cheap option.

tomhiddleston,3dpjfk,loubric,2,Sun Jul 19 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"This company is very good and very reliable to order from. They hand mix each order you place from formulas they create that follow various themes. Some themes are from ""cult"" movies, some from famous comic books or fantasy novels, some themes follow general ideas or moods. The perfumes are oils and are much richer and more unique than regular commercial perfumes, and often don't have that artificial smell that store perfumes have. When you order, they also send you samples to try of other scents, and that is how you find new scents that you like. Some of the perfumes offer descriptions of their scent ingredients so that you can try to find new scents that you might like to try. I found out about this company through this subreddit when the scents for Only Lovers Left Alive were released. I have ordered many many of their perfumes now, I wear them constantly, and I find that I almost never choose to wear my older traditional store bought perfumes. I highly recommend trying and experimenting with BPAL perfumes. Study their website carefully."

tomhiddleston,3da217,Eeyores_Prozac,7,Tue Jul 14 17:52:07 2015 UTC,"I had my birfday.  It was okay.  It was a modicum less depressing than most years - I do not do well with birthdays for a number of reasons.  Instead of going to SDCC, I had a consolation prize this past weekend - my city is host to the world's biggest furry convention, Anthrocon.  So I went to it.  Why the hell not?  Yes, furries. The people that the internet tells you has creepy, constant sex in weird animal costumes.  Which could still just be The Wicker Man (original) fanfic, really.  And by and large it was the nicest, most cheerful con I've ever been to - and I've been going to nerd showdowns for a couple decades.  So I have no shame about going.  Shit, I bought a hilariously furry hat with ears on it to fit in.  And once I was in there, lemme tell you, the stories are so overblown.  You have to hunt for most of the weird shit (of course it is there), it's mostly just like a big weird Disney parade.  I have seen so much weirder and worse at anime/comic cons it's hilarious.  (also, dunno if it was just how this one is, but it seemed way more diverse and inclusive than the average dudebro media con.  Also, also, they are really into Cthulhu, some of the vendors.  I have a lovely Miskatonic U. shirt now)"
tomhiddleston,3da217,Eeyores_Prozac,3,Tue Jul 14 19:36:08 2015 UTC,"Happy birthday! I always figured furries had a bad rap. Even if they did just have sex in costumes, who the fuck cares? I'm glad you had fun :) I wonder if I can get my mom to knit me a Cthulhu plushie without having to explain who/what he is :p"

tomhiddleston,3da217,Eeyores_Prozac,3,Wed Jul 15 13:46:23 2015 UTC,Happy birthday! And I'm really gonna have to research this Cthulhu thing. Y'all talk about him so much I'm curious. :)
tomhiddleston,3da217,sageicedragonx,2,Wed Jul 15 04:02:07 2015 UTC,"Short rundown: dude named HP Lovecraft got into horror in a big, weird way, writing stories about impossible to understand deities and inexplicable things happening to people.  What gave him a lot of longevity (if not particularly money in his lifetime) is the way he made it kind of a social structure, too - if a writer wanted to dance around the fringes of what he was doing, that was cool with him.  He might borrow bits of their stuff - he did that at the start, borrowing from Arthur Machen and Ambrose Bierce, and many others.    That's why there's actually a ton of overlap between Lovecraft Country and Conan the Barbarian. Just this big mess of stories about powerful beings with no recognizable purpose, awful things happening to people for no understandable reason, and it hooked into people.  And this went on after he died, with August Derleth at one point controversially trying to make a more recognizable structure out of it for people to play with - as Robert Bloch did later on, and F. Paul Wilson, and Stephen King.  Lots of people draw from Lovecraft Country, and Cthulhu is basically a mascot.  Which is funny, because in the original Lovecraftian works, he's really a bit player.  (also, general social note, some of the roots of Lovecraft are frankly shitty; HP adored the mythology and history of world cultures, particularly Egypt and the Cajun and black culture of Louisiana.  He was frightened of the people, resulting in a lot of othering and a lot of racism.  My beef with some later writers, including Bloch, is that they don't evolve away from those roots and think they're more essential than they are.  Guillermo del Toro is much, much better about this.)  Sorry!  This topic is sort of my crack habit."
tomhiddleston,3da217,Eeyores_Prozac,2,Wed Jul 15 13:59:08 2015 UTC,"Happy birthday! And I don't think furries are weird. There is a great furry comic called ""Sabrina"" that I tend to read from time to time. It's pretty funny."

I had the internet culture mindset about them for a long time, but I ended up meeting one through a friend several years back who pretty much set fire to all my preconceived notions.  I've been chill about them since and in the last couple years would call myself pro-furry.  :P  I used to read an anthropomorphic comic called Hepcats because it was so well regarded, but the author eventually wandered off.  Never connected it to furry fandom at the time.  Might check out Sabrina because why not?"
tomhiddleston,3da217,NauticalxDisaster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:03:35 2015 UTC,"Happy belated!  I'd say that was a pretty fun way to spend a birthday; I mean, how many people do you know can say ""I spent my birthday surrounded by adults in animal costumes!""? Anyway, interesting to get some insight into the whole furry thing.  I've always laughed about the culture because purple wolves and teal raccoons don't particularly get me going, but hey, I dress up for halloween and usually there's sex involved, so whatever floats your boat, nam sayin'?   Anyway, glad your birthday wasn't too painful this year.  Mine's upcoming and I'm feeling strangely weird about it, and it's not a milestone or anything either.  Whatever, that's what alcohol and cake are for. ;)"

If that's the case, then I agree.  I don't  agree with what they have to say but reddit was touting their free speech mentality. I don't think subreddits should be banned just because you don't like what they have to say. Just don't go there. If it's within the bounds of legality and within the sub then so be it.  But FPH left the sub and started getting (even more) ridiculous so they really brought it upon themselves."
tomhiddleston,3da217,fangurl1976,3,Wed Jul 15 22:00:20 2015 UTC,"Reddit has fewer restrictions and thus a greater audience for racist content than the official Stormfront forums.  The 'chimpire' subs received record traffic in the days after the Charleston shooting, with a mod taking the name of the shooter.  As a writer, I'm conscious of the need for open speech, but I'm also keen to the needs of both society and our conscience.  Reddit needs to make a final decision about the route it wants to take for its content.  Personally, I'm fine with seeing these elements take their speech elsewhere."

tomhiddleston,3ca9f4,Eeyores_Prozac,4,Mon Jul 6 09:23:37 2015 UTC,"My husband bought a guitar last week.  I don't know what I expect you to do with this information.  I've barely figured out what I'm doing with that information.  Do I mind?  No.  I'm confused, but okay.  He's never touched an instrument in his life, but he's got a coworker with some good information including the name of a place for lessons.  So, alright.  His brother's 'played' guitar for years - I say played with those snotty little air quotes because the guy has four guitars and is only capable of plinking a small handful of churchy barbecue tunes and one song by the White Stripes.  You probably know the one.  I've told my husband I expect three actual songs and rock star leather pants from him.  The pants especially."
tomhiddleston,3ca9f4,sageicedragonx,2,Mon Jul 6 14:41:32 2015 UTC,"Lol. Maybe he was always interested in learning? Maybe he wants to impress you, who knows. Instruments are fun and people often play them to become known for some thing in their inner circle or their own satisfaction. I use to play the piano and the drums. It's a good creative outlet. It's even better when you play with friends. I use to drum with my friends in college m we all lived in the same house. One owned a guitar and the other ones a bass guitar. I picked up a cheap used set and off we went jamming horribly to songs we liked. Lol. I got better though until I had to sell my kit."
tomhiddleston,3ca9f4,Eeyores_Prozac,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"He's been in a long phase of casting around for a proper hobby that he can attach to.  He's one of those guys that has trouble sticking to something long enough to see if he can create any actual attachment to something, though.  One setback, or not enough progress right away, and he frustrates quick.    I've had him practicing sketching - and the frustration for me is I can clearly fucking see that he could develop excellent skills in it, but he's not convinced.  He compares himself to others and then it's back to square one.  (we have both enormous issues with self esteem, this is an extra challenge layer)  The only reason I sort of laid back and rolled with the guitar thing is because a: he's got a friend that can help him get proper learning, b: if he financially invests he might stick a while, and c: he's always had a bit of competitive attitude about his little brother, and that might goad him.  I wish it was to impress me, maybe he'd be more regular about going to the gym. :P  I'll settle for something that makes him happy."

tomhiddleston,3ca9f4,NauticalxDisaster,2,Mon Jul 6 18:58:17 2015 UTC,"Its gotta be seven nation army right?  Oh yeah, and kinda off topic but on the topic of guitars.  When I split from my ex he took up guitar.  I think it was what he did to keep from masturbating 24/7(rolling my eyes).  He would randomly show up at my house with some excuse saying he'd forgotten to take something, would then grab my guitar, plop down on my couch and proceed to play songs with hidden meanings that I would get to decipher later.  Never in my life have I met someone with so much trouble just saying something.  No instead he had to play some song and hope I caught on.  Over time they went from still loving me to me being the hand that held him down.  Was interesting to watch the progression."

So I look up my individual marks for each assignment for Marketing (one I failed) and I got a 0 for my final essay. So, after having a nervous breakdown I check my emails for the email saying I submitted it before the due date. Good news is I found the email. Bad news is all my friends got there marks just fine. So now it is 10pm, I cant access the program my university uses to upload our work as it is down. (Even though it was meant to be working at 9pm)  So now I am left thinking that something is wrong with the file, it didn't upload properly or that they hated my essay that much they gave me a 0. All the staff are on holidays, so I have to ring tomorrow asking wtf is happening. I have pretty bad anxiety, so talking to a stranger is a struggle  sigh Well I feel better now that I have gone through a load of posts on here and looked at the butt gif from the Crimson Peak trailer a few too many times.

Don't worry about it: there was probably some kind of technical error. This is why all of my professors insisted we submit a hard copy as well as a digital one, just in case something happens. You have an e-mail proving you submitted it before the due date; I doubt they won't give it any consideration (and if they don't, you can always appeal/ask the student union or the head of your department for help.

The movie was bursting at the seams as it is, and I don't think it was necessary to actually show Loki in order to understand what was happening: the audience already knows he faked his death and just assume he's the one behind all the debauchery, while Thor just needs to know Asgard's in some sort of trouble.  I mostly want to see the scene because you know Tom acted the shit out of it :)"
tomhiddleston,3c5k5e,7elis,3,Sun Jul 5 08:45:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, that scene! I can understand the reasoning behind leaving it out too, if it would have broken up the flow of the movie as a whole. I was talking about the scene where the camera pans over Loki's naked back, giving a clear view of his full-body tattoos, and the later bathhouse scene where it's shown Thor wears some markings on his body that also reflect the same themes, I think it would have offered an interesting insight on the cultural customs and traditions of Asgard. Sorry for the mix-up, it's the words like orgy and debauchery, they get me confused!"

Erm, basically, what happened was that when Sister mentioned an Asgradian orgy, I assumed she was jokingly referring to some non-existent scene (in the  theme of general fandom complaints on how all the most significant and best scenes are always cut and how every movie would have been so much better if only they hadn't messed it up in the cutting room), and just ran with it. I'm sorry for failing to deliver it clearly enough and offer my sincere apologies for starting your day with my bs!!!"

Anyway, I've never seen such scenes discussed, and I'd be sincerely surprised if they exist: I know Marvel likes to exploit Chris Hemsworth's impressive physique, but they're still a Disney-owned company.

tomhiddleston,3bz6ll,sageicedragonx,2,Fri Jul 3 15:00:57 2015 UTC,Hahahaha. Why that is so kind of you. I got super lucky this year with the ticket this time. The only downer about this convention is how popular it has become. So you spend a portion of it either fighting to get something or waiting in massive lines for something really big. Famous actors like Tom make an appearance and that just drives a frenzy. If I were a celebrity I would be frightened to visit sdcc. I've seen the avengers leave their booth and it was pandemonium.
tomhiddleston,3bz6ll,StarlitDreams,2,Fri Jul 3 18:12:45 2015 UTC,cough Go check Legendary's Twitter account. ;D (There's a Crimson Peak signing.) Good luck! <3
tomhiddleston,3bz6ll,sageicedragonx,2,Tue Jul 7 00:31:12 2015 UTC,I just saw that. I'm going to check the line periodically on saturday to see how ridiculous the line looks. It's a toss up and depending on the rules. If its a drawing then it will be more difficult. If its a stand in line chances are I can start lining up early and pray I never have to pee for several hours. Hall h schedule looks like an absolute battle royal if I don't get a line bracelet. I can only chose one place to be in and miss out on the other. Fudge.
tomhiddleston,3bz6ll,StarlitDreams,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:36:19 2015 UTC,"The way that they're talking about handing out tickets to the signing is sort of: be the first to get to the Legendary booth and they'll hand out tickets. But they don't say at all how they're going to do that for their individual signings. (All I really remember about last year was their line wrapping around their booth. And the year they handed out tickets for the Godzilla experience it was sporadic.) Your best bet is probably to ask at Legendary's booth on Thursday and to keep an eye on their Twitter.   (Also, holy crud Saturday is going to be busy for him with the signing, the panel, and the Nerdist Podcast Live.)   Same! I'm actually giving up the signing (because I remember the year I attempted that for Thor TDW) and just focusing on the Hall H panel because there is not enough Crimson Peak information in my life (and I'm expecting cute Guillermo and Tom back and forth gushing given last year)."
tomhiddleston,3bz6ll,sageicedragonx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:51:39 2015 UTC,I hated the legendary Godzilla Bullshit they pulled that year. You go to the godzilla event and the tickets were given some where else. All quite a distance apart. I really wanted tickets for the nerd hq mystery panel or maybe thr bad ass woman panek but I didn't get it.  Going to be so annoyed if he did a panel again. On the bright side I did score tickets for Elijah Wood and the hitman movie. So I'm square. Can't always get what you want. I really want to see the warcraft movie people at that hall h event but Saturday looks like such a cluster and the legendary panel had to be in the middle of the day. Way to go comic con. Ill attempt to score a wrist band. For hall h the day before if that doesn't work out I'll just aim for the signing. I don't need sleep any way. Sleep is for losers. Lol.

One was last week, I dreamt I was dancing at a function being held at a Macy's type department store and Tom saw me and cut in with the guy I was dancing with and we danced and then for some reason we were a secret item, I just remember the song the band was playing was ""I've had the Time of my Life"" from Dirty Dancing, and he was trying to make me feel more comfortable by rubbing my arms, it was a lovely dream!   The the second one was Saturday night and it was about Loki, for some reason i had managed to sneak with Thor into Asgard and I was trying to seduce Loki by wearing a red corset, it was actually working but then I woke up :(   Fun times!"

tomhiddleston,3bl75t,MrsSaffronReynolds,3,Tue Jun 30 03:07:22 2015 UTC,"He's already been mentioned as a potential Oscar nom for this role.  Biopics make great Oscar bait.  I can't wait to see the bazillion interviews and appearances and all, like we did with Cumberbatch and ""The Imitation Game"".  No doubt by the end we will scream if we hear ""tortured soul"" one more time! ;)"
tomhiddleston,3bl75t,sistersa1vation,2,Tue Jun 30 15:37:29 2015 UTC,"Aside from the Awards Watch guys rooting for him, there was a very favorable article in Radio Times this morning, about how the fact he actually sings in the biopic is sure to impress the Academy. I think the fact the movie doesn't even have a trailer out, but is already being talked about, speaks volumes as to Sony Classics' PR and the opinions of those who have seen early versions. I really hope he doesn't take a leaf out of Cumberbatch's book - I think all but the most obsessive of fangirls got tired of him about midway through the season - because I'm really looking forward to this. They couldn't have picked a more respectful or articulate man to tell Hank's story, and I think even the naysayers who didn't believe a British actor could faithfully portray their beloved Hank will be charmed over by him.  And ""tortured soul""? Bitch please, if I could sit through several dozen ""Loki is such a complex character"" through three movies, I can do a couple of months with the ghost of Hank Williams Sr :)"

tomhiddleston,3bl75t,fangurl1976,2,Tue Jun 30 19:58:37 2015 UTC,"He's pretty terrific with accents - remember when he pulled that Owen Wilson impression, or the Valley Girl on Top Gear? If he can do it on the spot like that, I can only imagine what he's like after months of training, especially when his accent wasn't all that bad to begin with. This is a man who really puts work in; and everyone involved with the movie were deeply impressed by him, including Rodney Crowell."

tomhiddleston,3bl75t,Eeyores_Prozac,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:11:26 2015 UTC,"It's too early to know, because there are no release details yet. If it is anything like The Imitation Game, it will start with a limited release and then expand a few weeks later to a wide release. However, it is also completely possible that it will go straight to a wide release.  Either way, it should have a wide release eventually (hopefully immediately) because they are positioning it for Oscar nominations. If you have a general chain cinema like AMC or Regal in your area, I'm sure you'll get to see it."

Next phase: now what?   I don't know why I wrote here,  maybe I'm just looking for an outlet, maybe I want some encouragement, or maybe some words of wisdom from other post-grads.  Here's the thing, I want to be a writer--or more specifically--a novelist. It's the only thing I love to do, and as much as I've tried, I can't get into anything else. My parents want me to go to law school. I thought about it, and I'm sure if I put the effort in, I could do it. Maybe. But it's not what I want. And I'm having a hard time convincing everyone, even myself, that I should and can be a writer for a living. I don't want it to just be a hobby, but I know it's as difficult to be a successful writer as it is to be an actor. I don't know what to do."
tomhiddleston,39w5st,sageicedragonx,3,Thu Jun 18 02:12:09 2015 UTC,"First off, congrats on getting your degree. It's a great accomplishment and you should be proud of yourself. Now onto the part that matters...  Take it from me that wasted 10 years of my life avoiding what I wanted to be because I didn't believe in myself and listened to what everyone else had to say. Do what you want and don't waste time on pleasing everyone else. If I had learn that I would be in LA already acting and perhaps getting some where. But now I'm playing catch up.   I'm a novel writer myself and a damn good content editor. The way I got more involved with my writing was to find critique groups to submit and get opinions and feedback. I reached out into the community for support rather than hid on an island. I'm telling you that is the way to get more belief in yourself when you are surrounded by inspiration and good vibes.  But keep in mind to be realistic as well. Find a stable job that will keep you afloat as you write. Something that won't drain your life force and that gives you the ability to live on your own. Then don't take no for an answer. You are just as good as anybody out there.   Don't let people fool you. They are out there not because they are that much more amazing they are out there because they took the chance to stick themselves out there and get rejected. There are thousands of better writers that are too self conscious of their work. So they don't bother taking the first step.  You are capable and if you love what you do, you will do it more. Love is the birth of creativity which fuels your writing. And if you need an opinion on anything you are working on I am more than happy to take a look at it. I run my own critique group in my area so I work with every level of person. Writing is a skill that takes a long time to master. But finishing takes courage  and discipline. Hope this helps. I have much love for my fellow writers because we are beautiful and adventurous at heart."
tomhiddleston,39w5st,MakeSomethingUp711,2,Thu Jun 18 03:49:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your response. Finishing is definitely the hardest part, because I'm always thinking of something new to write about. So, I stop writing whatever I was into and start fresh on something else before I lose it.  How did you find the right stable job, something that makes the degree useful and doesn't bore you to death? Is there really a variety of things I could do with an English degree? I always feel like teaching is the default, and I'm not really into that.   Do you mind saying what area you're in?  I'm just curious if there are any critique groups where I am. I'm in California. I have no idea how to even search for something like that."
tomhiddleston,39w5st,sageicedragonx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:30:17 2015 UTC,"There are probably several kinds of jobs you can use the degree for. Copy writing for websites and promotional/marketing material might be one. What about editing for a publishing company? You would have to do some research on that as my degree was in digital media.Jobs are a necessity, but its really about attitude. If you think it sucks, it will suck. Nothing will ever be perfect in the beginning. You have to work toward your perfect life. I feel experiences will give you the fuel you need. Experiences give you writing material, even bad ones.  Not finishing is the writers curse and is your enemy. We have too many ideas. If you don't want to lose an idea, have a document to write all of that down and go back to what you are working on. You can always flesh it out later. Keep in mind your first few finished stories may not turn out as great as you hoped, but that is normal. Writers take a while to pump out a book that they feel is worth sharing.  As for my area, I live in the central coast area near the base out here. I can private message you if you live in the same area. Right now this app is pissing me off. It's lagging I'll write more later. Lol."
tomhiddleston,39w5st,sageicedragonx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:50:53 2015 UTC,"So continuing with what I said. I think the best kind of job is the kind that allows you to get out of your world and puts you in another. Something that pushes you to travel. My job makes me travel and as a result, I have more experiences and an interesting look on life.  It doesn't have to be directly connective to writing either. Tour guides, teaching English in an Asian country, the military, the peace corp, missionary work, over seas volunteerism and various other types of jobs/experiences can have the same effect.  By the way I live in Cali as well. That is what I meant by the central coast. Not sure if that is any where near you. If you want to find a local critique group you can go to meetup.com and search from there. There are ones in all major cities. I know for a fact LA has several with workshops."
tomhiddleston,39w5st,fangurl1976,2,Fri Jun 19 11:50:06 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your degree!   I agree with sageicedragonx...if writing is what you love, then go for it 110%!"

I won't bore anyone with an overload of details, but when you have depression there comes a point sometimes for some people where it cycles down into the brilliant nadir of a total meltdown before you can crawl back up.  So, yeah.  That was pretty great, with the effects going through the weekend and some other nonsense going on.  Sunday, things started to improve.  Then, this morning, my partner began the next phase of his own meltdown cycle. Aaaaand the fucking landlords here have the worst rental payment system ever so we are currently trapped on some Schrodinger's Cock nightmare wheel where we've either not been charged for rent yet or we're about to get charged twice.  So that's fun.  Sorry for the dumping ground, but it helps.  Um... something less horrible... um... we're going to the Of Monsters and Men concert when it comes here in September?  (oh and fuck Game of Thrones)"

If you need a ""shoulder/ear"" feel free to PM me, sometimes just an outside opinion or knowing someone is there is helpful!"
tomhiddleston,391hq3,sageicedragonx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"Is this an automated system? If so, you can always just drop a check off each month. Rent doesn't change month to month does it? Also I would just call some one from their headquarters or their boss to complain. Usually sets them straight. Is that possible? Sorry you are having a rough time.  Also GoT was awesome. I dont know what you all are talking about. But I was waiting for the ending to happen any way. So no surprises."
tomhiddleston,391hq3,Eeyores_Prozac,2,Tue Jun 9 13:07:45 2015 UTC,"They have a recurring payment portal.  The problem is they switched programs and this one doesn't work for shit.  So when no payment ever got collected by the due date and the system seemed to 'hang' without putting anything through, my partner did a one-time payment.  Then that didn't go through either and we tried to contact the office.  The office is on vacation.  They claimed to have forwarded our problem to the main accounting office yesterday.  This morning they double-charged us.  To say I'm annoyed is a fairly strong understatement.  We'll probably be crawling up the food chain.  (late edit: Yay, they're going to do SOMETHING ish to refund one of the payments.  Eventually.  Probably take like a week, gripe moan, but at least they acknowledged a problem.)  GoT has (imo) been horribly paced with drawn-out scenes that kill the tension repeatedly this year.  And I kind of don't like how D&D are basically throwing GRRM under the bus this week to deflect any controversy against their version of the story.  How To Tame Your Drogon was cool, though."

Waiting for that one all season. The only thing I didnt like was john snows long ass scenes of very heightened tension and the sand snakes. They only got slightly more interesting in jail but they are still not convincing as actors. I feel they are a cartoon offspring version of oberyn.  And yay for your rent situation!"

I haven't really been active on Reddit.  Other than that, my friend forced me to watch Daredevil with her and I AM SO GLAD SHE DID OMG that show is perfection. I'm in love with the avocados and giddy with impatience for the next season. A whole year. I can't believe it. I can't believe we get only thirteen episodes per year. It's not enough. It's not nearly enough! Who else has watched it? :)  And how's everyone else been?"
tomhiddleston,391hq3,fangurl1976,3,Mon Jun 8 17:47:47 2015 UTC,My husband binge watched it a few weeks ago was full of praise. He was complaining about the short season too.i might take a peek since I'll be home all week. Good luck with your exams!

tomhiddleston,391hq3,loubric,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:20:40 2015 UTC,"It does get better. I was somewhat frustrated too, but it allows for some excellent backstory and plot development over the series IMO. Up till where you've watched is basically the laying of the foundation.   I'd recommend you watch the next episode, because that's when Fisk actually gets plenty of attention, and Vincent D'Onofrio is incredible in the role. It's a pivotal point.  If you still haven't gotten a taste for it after E04 or E05, chances are you won't like it."

I guess he changed his fucking mind cuz after 2 interviews I got zero calls or offers. I'm kind of bummed. I don't know if this is a sign to not over exert myself or just move on to another store.

Now my freezer is packed to the brim and I never want to cook anything ever again (and I like to cook). How do parents manage to go to work, cook, clean house, and take care of multiple children without going off the deep end? Seriously, I'm exhausted dealing with just the two of us (plus two dogs).    Uh, what else? It was hovering in the mid-90s, so I took a few small breaks to lie in my backyard in a kiddie pool. It's ghetto as fuck but I buy one every summer because I'm a classy bitch. $15, yo.   Also, I'm obsessed with Muse's new album; having been a hardcore fan since oh, around 2003, I think this is the best one they've put out in years. Finally! But that's what /r/Muse is for. ;)  This word vomit has been brought to you by the letter ""I"" for ""inanity"" and the number 573, the number of years I feel like it'll be before Tom's movies and accompanying promo tours begin."

Of course, it's quickly undone again because of the kids, but I soldier on. Some weekends we'll grill a lot of meat so all I have to worry about during the week is side dishes.

I was at my friends house babysitting and at 9 am we busted out the blow up kids pool.  And two days later it's raining. All day.

But that isn't anything new and its temporary. 2 years and I move on.  Comic con is coming up next month. I'm going by myself again (my friend couldnt go last minute) but I got a whole plan and mission there so that will occupy my time.   Ummm....I'm working on some concepts for a short film project, reading and helping out another project for a friend and I have extra leave to burn so I'm deciding how I want to spend it before september ends.

I like him as a redhead, too, but blonde just looks so much more at home on him.  Second of all: that ensemble looks absurdly good on him. It just goes with literally everything: his hair, his eyes, his skintone. This is by far the sexiest outfit I've ever seen him wear. I hope they'll let him keep some of the wardrobe from this series, because dayum, whoever's in charge over there is sure as hell serious about their job!

I can't see it coming out earlier, since Tom will have enough on his plate between filming Kong Island in the summer and then promoting High-Rise and Crimson Peak in the fall; and it would be risky releasing it later than early December if they want to be in the running for 2016's award season. Plus, November means Thanksgiving weekend, which is normally a big boost for the box office."

Personally, though, I'm all about this gif at the moment. Look at him, so pliant, so subservient... everyone always (rightfully) gushes about his make-out sesh with Virgilia, but this scene with Aufidius was so fucking erotic - even without the kiss. Or maybe it's just that I personally enjoy seeing Tom in that position :)"
tomhiddleston,3854v8,cordialoffendress,3,Tue Jun 2 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"Oh hell, I was way more into this scene than Virgilia's. Like, I was having a fucking MOMENT while watching that. Twinges, heart-racing, inability to silence audible groans - the works, like it's a goddamn porno. Was probably more responsive to it than porn, actually. Sigh.   This is why I have to watch his stuff alone first (vs. with other humans); the second time through I'm usually okay. Usually."

When you take the same joke and try it out on any female actress, the potentially offensive tone becomes much easier to notice, I think.  Anyway, I get it was a joke (as did other people) and I'm not really attributing any malicious motivations to it, just expressing my feelings on one of the sides of it. All depends on perspective, I'd say."

Reddit in general is PG-13 at best; and this sub is mostly populated by adults. You can't expect people to maintain a G-rated conversation at all times in this environment - certainly when the topic is an attractive man who by all appearances is very sexually open. I think this sort of thing only becomes a problem when and if it starts to dominate the entire narrative - which it doesn't.  I'm sorry if you find this kind of thing offensive. I can only repeat what I said before: it's a joke, and no harm was meant."

It's not an issue of ratings and content to me. You made a joke, I expressed my reaction, we established our differing approaches, I got no further issues about it.

I already take some other targeted supplements, but I figured, hey, I'll see if a multi will help me out.  Since the husband takes one, I figure, well, I'll try one of his and see what effect that has.  UM, HELLO INSANE ENERGY AND CHAOTIC VIVID PSYCHO DREAMS.  Apparently high doses of B vitamins can cause this.  I've always been a pretty vivid dreamer, and I tend to try to analyze (call it hokey; I find it fun), but whereas I used to have one or two pretty coherent, nice storyline, slice-of-life but slightly weirder dreams, now I'm having these psychotic dreams that involve 6 to 7 different scenarios with every person I've ever thought of or interacted with in my life (includes Tom, obviously).  Mostly I just find this amusing, but I've ordered a chick multivitamin with a slightly lower B6/B12 content to see what difference that makes."

(It's like how I feel about Sam Rockwell.  Terrific actor that I'll go watch in anything, but it was a long ass time before I got over Guy Fleegman as Crewman Number 6.)

I've said it before and I'll say it again: I love the type of actor who's not afraid of any character and consistently (or even almost consistently) churns out quality work. I think I read somewhere that he had cited Gary Oldman as his hero, which is absolutely unsurprising considering his body of work.  Also   every girl in town now notices I have a kitten and even though I have a skinhead and baggy pants on, the uniform of the criminal, I am now such a sweet boy with his kitten.

tomhiddleston,37vkm3,tritonoftheminnows,3,Sun May 31 00:45:19 2015 UTC,http://media.giphy.com/media/M0cWmMOAdn9Ek/giphy.gif  I feel like this has earned a custom flair but I slept like three hours last night and I'm functioning at barely 65% today. Pick one and it's yours ;)

tomhiddleston,37vkm3,cordialoffendress,2,Sun May 31 14:49:11 2015 UTC,"Aww, thanks :) but my creative faculties are down for the day... I'm in a cloud of semi-consciousness, caffeine and catnaps that's keeping me just about functioning until I can go home. Rumpshake Connoisseur works for me :) done!"

tomhiddleston,37qmoh,Miniwhinnie,3,Fri May 29 19:50:51 2015 UTC,Mmmm. Very nice.  Sometimes I wonder if it ever hurts him to wear pants that tight. Doesn't that pinch or get caught in the pant crease?
tomhiddleston,37qmoh,sistersa1vation,2,Sat May 30 12:40:02 2015 UTC,"Remember when he went to the Glamour Awards back in 2012 and wore these? That shit looked legit painful, like the fabric was cutting right into his flesh - but going by the wide smile, he either doesn't mind or... he likes it that way :P"
tomhiddleston,37qmoh,Cerulean_Shades,3,Sat May 30 16:41:22 2015 UTC,That... that's a concealed weapon. I think someone should frisk him. I volunteer as tribute.
tomhiddleston,37qmoh,zestrokes,2,Sat May 30 14:31:54 2015 UTC,"My, what tight pants you have! All the better to se... hehe"
tomhiddleston,37qmoh,MajesticalLoki,2,Sat May 30 15:27:40 2015 UTC,The Hiddlesconda makes another appearance.
tomhiddleston,37qmoh,MajesticalLoki,1 point,Sun May 31 22:24:37 2015 UTC,Are there other appearances?!  Please point me toward them!
tomhiddleston,37p4qx,Eeyores_Prozac,4,Fri May 29 08:12:29 2015 UTC,I'm just here for butt and those fucking little crinkles around his eyes and to keep playing out the hopefully not tired shtick of being fairly sure he's the ruination of all innocent life on earth.   Because I'm not certain I'm joking some days.  Anyway.  138 days of life remaining before Crimson Butt- I mean Peak.  I meant butt.
tomhiddleston,37p4qx,Eeyores_Prozac,6,Sat May 30 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"Oooh happy cakeday! I, for one, will never tire of the Eldritch stories AKA the goddamn truth.  I'm here for the prickly scruff and the occasional errant curl, but mostly for all those precious moments when he acts like the little shit he really is ♥"

tomhiddleston,37p4qx,cordialoffendress,1 point,Sat May 30 17:00:21 2015 UTC,That second gifset...how is the recipient of those looks still standing?! It's not fair!
tomhiddleston,37p4qx,Eeyores_Prozac,2,Sun May 31 05:28:01 2015 UTC,"My second favorite part about that gifset is seeing Jeremy Renner sitting next to him, because there's no way he's not seeing this happen from the corner of his eye, which only serves to make his stone-faced determination not to look over all the funnier XD  My first favorite part is that shit-eating grin in the last one. Tom, your Loki's showing :P  Speaking of ""how is the recipient of those looks still standing"", I just remembered another much-loved ""little shit"" moment: when he shamelessly flirted with that girl at the Thor Press Conference in London. It starts around 6:33 when she comes over with a mug for Ken Branagh: Tom doesn't really notice her at first, but then he looks over as she's putting the mug down, and by the time she's walking away he's already fixed his eyes on her. He follows her with his gaze until (presumably) she returns to her spot and looks back at the stage... and then the little shit winks and smiles at her like it ain't no thang, at which point I can only assume she burst into flames from the heat of that stare.  ...now that's a master at work.  (paging /u/cordialoffendress because she needs to see this, and /u/Eeyores_Prozac because Loki hair ;))"
tomhiddleston,37p4qx,fangurl1976,2,Sun May 31 07:25:46 2015 UTC,"That. Little. Shit. Even through a phone screen, that wink has reduced me to a pile of smoldering ash. It's the fact that every time he does something like that, there's no hiding it; his eyes just follow, follow, follow, then boom! -the recipient dies. Even if she's still standing. Injuries can be internal, y'know."
tomhiddleston,37p4qx,cordialoffendress,2,Sun May 31 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"His self-confidence is the sexiest thing about him. I know lots of fans say they get second-hand embarrassment when they watch him do certain things, but personally I applaud him for being so cool about everything and not being afraid of looking silly. This is a classic example: so many guys would have looked away in his position, fearing some kind of horrible rejection; but not Tom. He makes his intentions 100% clear, and after that? Let the dice fall where they may. SO hot."

tomhiddleston,37p4qx,Eeyores_Prozac,1 point,Sun May 31 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"That wink made me scream ""Oh, for God's sake, Tom!"" at my screen. Lately looking at pics of him makes me want to smother him with a pillow kisses."
