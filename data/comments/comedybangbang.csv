comedybangbang,3cx7py,tequilasauer,2,Mon Jul 13 23:33:06 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind seeing how Gino works with Benny S. Ben talks a lot too so Gino would have his hands full getting him plenty of water.
comedybangbang,3cvnl9,nursehole,6,Sat Jul 11 03:56:34 2015 UTC,"I thought Kid Cudi did a really great job and I'm really excited to see him again. Reggie isn't replaceable by any means so I'm glad to see that Cudi isn't necessarily trying to. If Cudi brought the same dry sense of humor then it may not work as well, but instead he uses is positive and exciting energy to his advantage and it'll make the show different for better or worse."
comedybangbang,3cvnl9,BreakingClean,2,Sat Jul 11 05:23:33 2015 UTC,"I really liked him, pleasantly suprised (Not that i had low expectations, i just had none, i've heard like one song of his and know next to nothing about him). This will change episode to episode obviously but as a general demeanor i think his geniality could fit well with Aukerman. One thing i think they need to do away with is to cut to reaction shots, they worked with Reggie's dry deadpan but not so much here and i think keeping them just seems a little to much like forcing him into Reggie's role."
comedybangbang,3cvnl9,Wil_Axehoe,2,Sat Jul 11 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I noticed the same with the reaction shots, maybe next season they'll have better ideas on how to best utilize Cudi's character."
comedybangbang,3cvnl9,vanthe_man,2,Sun Jul 12 01:51:34 2015 UTC,"Big fan of Cudi's first couple records, so his version of the theme song makes since..But it honestly was a let down. Its very quiet and kind of forgettable, I have no memory of how it went. But I completely remember Reggie's song being stuck in my head after the very first time I saw the show. That's my only complaint. Kid Cudi is a great fit. He seems to be a genuinely funny dude so he'll make a great sidekick which I'm excited to see his actual acting rolls in skits/segments. And I'm his band leader music will be really good, because he really is a talent musician. But just probably more traditional as opposed to Reggie's kinda signature bizarre sound. Episode overall was hilarious. Michael Cera has always done well with CBB and BTF, and Andy Daly always kills it. Also, side note, legitimetly felt really bad for Kid Cudi when Scott was being a Dick to him. They writing for all those moments really delivered."

comedybangbang,3cvnl9,EveryonesScreaming,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"Just finished watching it. Some observations…  I think we’re hard wired now to see the CBB opening animation FUSED with Reggie’s bass/beat heavy opening and vocal, so the Cudi’s track probably needed and deserved it’s own animation sequence (be it tweak or overhaul).   New CBB logo was not needed but looks nice and is used the same ways as before. Losing the teeth visual would have been an error.  Studio refinements are fine. Netflix folks in the US should look as any Season 1 ep now and see how cramped and poorly lit every was when they were sharing Tim & Eric studio space (I think).  Eric the PA’s haircut is jarring. He should be shaggy again and you know I’m right.  Cudi’s synth pads don’t appear connected but I know nothing of synth pads. It does seem like ALL of the Cudi’s performance is taps of silence with track added in post production whereas I think the majority of Reggie’s performance was realtime?  Daly is consistently superb. Smart to book him last guest on the season opener to remind everybody that CBB = comedy first.  Fuck the red lotus gang.  tl;dr - A healthy dollop of change but zero concern for the future."

comedybangbang,3cvjco,mojamad,2,Sat Jul 11 05:43:45 2015 UTC,"I don't feel that Kid Cudi added anything special to the show at all.

I'm not sure how else to say it: He's not weird enough for the show."

comedybangbang,3cp1l8,Drogalov,17,Thu Jul 9 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"I think that the show's statements to it being hipster are purely a self referential joke. It probably stems from Scott or the other writers reading some biting criticism of the show where someone called it 'unfunny ironic hipster crap'. There is a tendancy by some people to call anything that doesn't conform to the standards of normal pop culture 'hipster'. So to some extent, all alt/independent comedy gets labeled hipster by some. Do hipsters like CBB? I'm sure many do, but I can't even keep track of what all makes up the hipster lexicon these days."
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,jetpackjason,3,Thu Jul 9 17:53:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't know what USA comedy scenes were. In the UK we basically have the big arena comedians who cater for the masses but tend to be quite banal observational stuff. Then there's the alternative comedy scene which is where people like Scott, PFT, Bob  and David etc would fit in. I didn't know if they were a niche comedy market over there"
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,jetpackjason,3,Thu Jul 9 17:59:10 2015 UTC,I would say so. Most of the alt comedians I enjoy (including those you mentioned) are not household names here. I think podcasting really helped to create the current alternative comedy culture.
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,thelostdolphin,3,Thu Jul 9 18:09:02 2015 UTC,So who are the big mainstream comics?
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,thelostdolphin,3,Thu Jul 9 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"The biggest touring comedians right now would probably be Louie CK, Kevin Hart, Jerry Seinfeld, Aziz Ansari, and Jim Gaffigan. Most of them are comics I genuinely enjoy (and Louie is probably my favorite mainstream or alt standup). So they would be the types to sell out huge Vegas theaters or arena-type venues."
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,thelostdolphin,2,Thu Jul 9 21:37:49 2015 UTC,Other than Kevin Hart I like all those guys. Mainstream UK comedy is just so dull at the moment
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,Kurisonu,2,Thu Jul 9 21:42:02 2015 UTC,Same here. Hart seems like a genuinely good guy and really friendly but his comedy makes my eyes glaze over.   I'm sure there are equally dull mainstream successful comics that I'm not thinking of that are comparable to what you're describing there.   Who are some UK-based comics that you think an Earwolf podcast listener would really like?
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,Dashtego,5,Thu Jul 9 21:43:58 2015 UTC,"Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer are great. Incredibly weird though. Check out Shooting Stars if you can find it on YouTube. Stewart Lee is probably the most critically acclaimed comic going, but he's very dry. There's nit really a massive improv scene over here, but for the more irreverent stuff try Bill Bailey and Ross Noble."
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,beeclam,2,Thu Jul 9 21:52:49 2015 UTC,"I like weird. I'll definitely check them out.   I know Bill Bailey from Black Books but I've never really heard his standup.   I like loads of British tv shows and comedy though, but for some reason, stand up is still a blindspot for me.   Thanks for the recommendations."
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,1-9,2,Thu Jul 9 21:54:04 2015 UTC,"Try Harry Hill, he might be difficult to find, but his early stand up is the strangest I've ever seen."
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,Virginonimpossible,2,Thu Jul 9 21:57:45 2015 UTC,"Bill Bailey's stand up shows are great. Lots of musical numbers and A/V stuff. He has lots of recorded specials out, easy to find. Also check out Sean Lock, Lee Mack, Paul Foot and Micky Flannigan (regional heavy) for more weird.  Will second Vic and Bob too. Shooting stars is easy to find online and it's also where Matt Lucas (Little Britain) started to come to fame. Seriously weird show with the craziest games you will see."
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,the_king_of_farts,2,Thu Jul 9 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"For some reason I enjoy a lot of British comedians much more on panel shows than I enjoy their standup. I would way rather see Lee Mack, Rob Brydon, Rhod Gilbert, Bill Bailey, David Mitchell, and Kevin Bridges (to name a few) on QI or 8 Out of 10 Cats or something instead of doing a full standup set. I don't know if any of those people are ""mainstream"" though. As an American, I always wondered why the comic panel show format didn't work here. We tried with Hollywood Squares and that was a complete dud, and the closest thing we have right now is @Midnight which could conceivably be ok if it wasn't so manic, poorly edited, and hosted by the irrepressibly obnoxious Chris Hardwick."
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,thelostdolphin,2,Fri Jul 10 01:02:49 2015 UTC,"In a way, podcasts like CBB have hinted that a panel format might work in the US. I think the show would have to be anchored by the right people (host and regulars).  Scott mentioned something like an idea for a CBB after-show thing in his recent AMA. I think he described it being like a comedy Charlie Rose? Would be amazing tbh."
comedybangbang,3cp1l8,breakingcontact,2,Fri Jul 10 01:54:34 2015 UTC,"I've always thought it was down to an inherent difference in national character. Difficult to find a way to put it without sounding derogatory to one or the other, but the USA seems to suit a more individualistic approach where the UK sensibility tends to prefer more collective stuff. You can have a show of one type in the other land and it can work okay, because the core skill is similar, but they're not fundamentally playing to their strengths or the audience's cultural tastes so it never really takes off.   Of course there's always exceptions - Scott Aukerman works really well in a conversational setting and I don't think his solo stand-up would be that good, while Stewart Lee is pretty meek on panel shows but really flies when he's in sole command of your attention - but by and large this seems like a big part of the reason."

comedybangbang,3cp1l8,breakingcontact,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:19:21 2015 UTC,Rob Brydon has done 'specials' I prefer the one as Keith Barrat but he has done at least one as himself.

It's not often that Scott gets sentimental or breaks character.

I've been meaning to listen to it again, but I still can't... Haynong man.   Anyway, welcome back to Talkin' 'Tang!"

It was the first time I tried a comedy podcast instead of a video game one, I wanted to fill up my ipod with as much comedy as I could.   My first ever cbb episode was the sentient droid cake, and it made me feel like I couldn't connect to anyone, because I couldn't connect to the episode. I'm from the UK and it sounded like a wacky american morning show. I blamed myself and kept listening until I understood how much of a genius PFT is, and that Scott isn't forcing it, he really loves hanging out with Paul. CBB is something I love now."

I haven't really gone back through the archives, except when I was curious about characters (like Cake Boss's first appearance) and recurring bits (like Harris's Phone Corner). The end-of-year best-of specials are also good for beginners because they talk about sketches without being in-character- it's more of a behind-the-scenes look."

comedybangbang,39hyap,megatom0,5,Fri Jun 12 11:46:29 2015 UTC,The vibe between me and that episode was immediate
comedybangbang,39hyap,MackLuster77,4,Fri Jun 12 15:28:57 2015 UTC,"So the recurring guests who do characters build up an actual mythology (is that canon?) for their characters. The main ones would be: Marissa Whompler, Tracey Rearden, All of Paul F Thompkin's characters (Cake Boss, Werner Hertzog, Gary ""Call me Gary"" Marshal), James Adomian characters (mostly Jesse Ventura and Hule Howser).  Listen to all Paul F Thompkins episodes, then Jame Adomian (I actually suggest the Amy Poehler Adomian episode it is possibly the best). Look for Jessica St. Clair and Lennon Parham, those episode set up the Marissa Whompler mythology. Lauren Lapkis also sets up the Tracey Rearden stuff.   I will say that you don't necessarily need to listen to them in a specific order. In the first and second hundo episodes they tend to recount all of the established canon stuff whenever a character is on. Once you get past about 250 things get more complicated and they just throw you into things.   So I would say pick any episodes you want  from episode 50-250 and you will be okay. But definitely check out all of those comedians in the show. Also if you haven't listened to Lauren Lapkis' podcast listen to that, it is actually on par with CBB from time to time.   Edit: oh shit how could I forget Andy Daily, he has the most complicated character mythology which he actually pays pretty close attention to. Definitely listen to the Andy Daily and Patten Oswalt episode that introduces Don Demillo. Once you get to about episode 280 with Andy Daily, listen to the Andy Daily Podcast Pilot Project, which really expands the characters, just don't skip to episode 300 with Andy Daily, you need to build to that one."

However, it's important to know what show is driving what traffic to sponsors. They are of course competing with each other, but not in a way that is detrimental to the organization.

comedybangbang,35ltwp,BobLoblaw-at-Law,5,Mon May 11 23:04:31 2015 UTC,There seems to be consensus in the comments. I dislike the ads even when Scott is riffing on them and mocking his own stumbling over the ad copy. Sean and Hayes actively take the ads off message and we get to hear them riff with Scott. And they are funny enough that they were my highlight of the show.   Give Hollywood Handbook a listen.

comedybangbang,34ufef,Mousefang,16,Mon May 4 22:10:39 2015 UTC,I wanted Joey Tortellini to show up so badly
comedybangbang,34ufef,clown_baby244,20,Tue May 5 00:08:22 2015 UTC,I know it's wrong. But his Asian voice at the end of his last episode was way too funny.
comedybangbang,34ufef,MrFusionHER,4,Tue May 5 03:39:33 2015 UTC,"I really don't get why so many people I've talked to think it's racist to do an Asian accent and not a German one (for example). You could go on for hours as a Nazi character and no one would bat an eye, buy 30 seconds of an Asian voice and everyone loses their minds. People have such a strange interpretation of equality."
comedybangbang,34ufef,Circumv_ent,14,Tue May 5 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree. But, it comes down to 2 things. History and content.  Doing an exaggerated Asian voice is the audio equivalent to black face. There were a lot of years where white guys would go up and do exaggerated Asian accents for laughs. here's where we get to the content part.  The reason it's kind of OK to do German accents is, the accent isn't the joke. It's not really funny because it's a German accent, it's funny because what the German person is saying. When you're doing an Asian accent because you're making fun of the accent, that's offensive.  All of this being said, I don't actually think what Tommy Midds did was wrong in any way, shape, or form (despite what I said above). But it always has the potential to land in that area, so it's always a bit cringy, at least a first."

comedybangbang,343hfs,bananabooks,8,Tue Apr 28 02:16:10 2015 UTC,The first appearance is still the funniest to me because it seemingly came out of nowhere. Now there's a kind of canon associated with him I just find PFT brilliant and I enjoy his original characters.
comedybangbang,343hfs,frponkus,3,Tue Apr 28 03:10:23 2015 UTC,It's his kind sweet soul what makes it funny.
comedybangbang,343hfs,austinbond132,4,Tue Apr 28 02:48:04 2015 UTC,It's PFT Cajun flavored. Not everyone's taste.
comedybangbang,343hfs,Count_Critic,5,Tue Apr 28 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"I really wish PFT would go back to doing real people.  One of the main strengths of his characters has been coming up with ridiculous/implausiable character traits and backstory that I find way funnier when it's in the context of a real person.  PFT's silly stories about fictional characters doesn't do it for me.  I empathize with PFT getting bored by doing certain characters over and over, but I'd prefer he add new characters to his repertoire that are based on real people."
comedybangbang,3412zk,zorak303,4,Mon Apr 27 13:52:54 2015 UTC,"(Phone rings)  (A woman answers.) “Bathroom mirror, how can I help you?”  Oh, excuse me, is this Cigars and Stripes?  Yes it is.  I’m calling in regards to a video posted about a two-way mirror in the bathroom—  Hold on.  (Man picks up) Hello?  Hi, I’m with Jezebel, and I’m calling about the two-way mirror in your ladies’ restroom.  What does Jezebel do? I’ve never heard of her. And yes, absolutely: we have a two-way mirror in there, yes, yes; we’ve had it since 2001.  Okay. So, I’m just wondering why it’s in the ladies’ room?  Young lady, I have in my beer garden—I have a 10 and a half-foot hole. Did you know that it’s haunted. Did you know that a man fell dead. Do you know that we do seven days of Halloween. Do you know that mirror’s been there for the longest time. That woman opened the door. I mean she opened the door, there’s nothing in there. Open the door and pee and do what you want. Quite frankly I’m enjoying people calling, because I’m selling chicken wings.  Look, this woman is looking for a viral video. There’s a big movement in reality TV to be outraged about feminism. I’ve been in professional wrestling. So yes: come see my mirror; eat my wings—I don’t know what to tell you, honey.  And you’re going to keep the mirror in there?  I will burn this fucking place to the ground before I get rid of that mirror. Do you know how much joy that mirror has brought to us? We’re synonymous with Halloween. We do a freaky family fun day, and all the kids look in the mirror. This is a fun house, honey, and if you don’t like the two-way mirror, go fuck yourself; and if you come on my stage, have something to say. Everyone needs an angle. My angle is: I do barbeque; I promote it, and I break my ass for the local comics in Chicago. I pay them. I try to make them into rock stars. They do nothing, except for this. One girl said she wanted to pull her pants down and show her clitoris to me, and they all came and ate the wings.  So you’re the owner?  I’ve been the goddamned fucking owner for the past 16 miserable years, blood, sweat and tears. Do you know if Lenny Bruce was alive, he’d have something to fucking say about this. I go to bed for these comics.  But hey—how do you know this isn’t a publicity stunt I haven’t manufactured? You don’t, do you. You’re taking the word of someone else. How do you know I didn’t set that up?  Do you mind if I get your name?  My name is Ronnie Lottz, and by the way, you’re on speaker. Remind me again: you’re with Jezebel? Is that a little blog? [LOL]  Yeah, sure. It’s part of Gawker Media.  But wait, what are you guys, a small entertainment company? What is Gawker? This thing would go so viral if she was smart and called me on the fucking phone, but honey, you’d get 3 million hits on YouTube. 300 views [at the time of the call] ain’t going to do shit.  I’ll give you my email address and promote the shit out of your story—a big blast; Facebook campaign. Twitter isn’t going to get on it; she needs to be a little bit more aggressive—she’s really gotta go for it.  What’s your email address?  cigarsandstripes@gmail.com  Got it. Thanks.  Look, she’s on the right track, she’s just gotta work harder. I can’t explain it to you. Everyone is looking for a viral video; you’ve gotta get one. She should have put a phone in there, or said I’m recording. What we have here is a comic with a bad set who’s looking for a viral video. She’s doing nothing with her career; she’s stuck in Chicago. We sell fucking chicken wings. They want attention. I’d love to be on the reciprocating end of this; I’ll take this to the next level. I’ve already got T-shirts being printed.  It’s like if you put something [about the mirror] into that Yelp thing: no bitch, you didn’t, somebody else did about fucking five years ago. It’s old news; the door is open; it’s for Halloween. We used to hang a witch’s head in there so that the girls would pee, and they’d look into a dingy closet and be all weirded out. We specialize in making people feel very uncomfortable. It’s why we’re successful today. If you get it, you get it. If you don’t, stay home."

Just because Scott had never even met Heder (if I'm remembering correctly) and he knew Harris so well.  The chemistry was just so off.  I think that it could have been a lot better with a less frequent guest, or, honestly another regular that would have given him more to work with.  I love Harris's anti-humor, but I feel like it makes whoever he's with work a lot harder.

comedybangbang,32tjcl,whynotminot,10,Fri Apr 17 03:41:26 2015 UTC,"Stars did well, but the two had this weird dynamic that was a bit off-putting. I couldn't tell if they were good-naturedly ragging on each other or if they had years of baggage that was forcing its way out. I suspect the latter."

comedybangbang,32tjcl,Renegadeanon,1 point,Tue May 5 05:25:27 2015 UTC,"""Just awful"" seems strong. The worst ones I've heard are just where they don't really contribute much to the episode but don't disrupt the flow, either. Alicia Witt and Tears for Fears were both awesome guests and great at playing along."
comedybangbang,32tjcl,whynotminot,11,Sat May 2 20:55:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it was because of the guests or what, but the last two episodes (#344 and #345) were excruciating for me--and not in a good way like CBB can be at times.   For #344, Horatio is very hit or miss for me, and that, in conjunction with the guests that, imo, weren't really up to par, made for a pretty unfunny episode. For #345, I think the trampoline store premise just wasn't enough to carry it, though I like the actors that were on the episode (Perfect Couples was a great sitcom that was cancelled too soon!)."
comedybangbang,32tjcl,IzK,10,Thu Apr 16 18:22:04 2015 UTC,"Bitsy Boo was amazing the first time, but it felt like the room was too crowded this time for her to really get going. She kept getting cut off and they didn't really pursue any of the threads that she seemed to be trying to start.  EDIT: And yes, the trampoline gag was really drawn out. It definitely made me laugh in some parts, though."
comedybangbang,32tjcl,whynotminot,6,Fri Apr 17 15:19:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on both points. Bitsy couldn't ever get things going, and I did chuckle a couple of times at some of the trampoline stuff."
comedybangbang,32tjcl,patrickowtf,6,Fri Apr 17 16:10:46 2015 UTC,The last two episodes were pretty weak. I liked Bitsy the first time but this time she fell flat. Jamie didn't really contribute much and Haratio was off.
comedybangbang,32tjcl,funnyhowthings,7,Thu Apr 16 20:36:14 2015 UTC,sometimes horatio is really funny but a lot of the time it feels like he just doesn't care as much as he probably should. like even just a little bit of preparation would help him out...
comedybangbang,32tjcl,malomolam,4,Thu Apr 16 20:40:38 2015 UTC,"that's been his style even back in SNL, I feel like he should be a bigger star"
comedybangbang,32tjcl,wikais,2,Fri Apr 17 02:19:00 2015 UTC,Scott just needs to bring in PFT and we'll forget these two
comedybangbang,32tjcl,MustacheSmokeScreen,2,Mon Apr 20 02:03:51 2015 UTC,Horatio has been on so much this year and I don't know yet if I like him. Whenever I see he's in an episode I always go in to it already disliking it. I don't ever find him particularly funny. And I agree with Monday's episode. The trampoline premise was dragged out too much to where they couldn't move on to somewhere else so they had to get everything out of it.
comedybangbang,32tjcl,DaintySload,27,Thu Apr 16 20:45:47 2015 UTC,Tig. I hate the whole stick in the mud attitude when she deals with characters.

comedybangbang,32tjcl,bagofbeef74,9,Mon Apr 20 18:57:59 2015 UTC,That is her gimmick though. Pretty similar to what Harris did.
comedybangbang,32tjcl,25schmeckels,16,Fri Apr 17 01:34:15 2015 UTC,"Harris was a lot more willing to keep a bit moving, or start one, than Tig. His anti-comedy tendencies were more commonly part of a bit he would start."

comedybangbang,32tjcl,zorak303,6,Mon Apr 20 00:27:28 2015 UTC,episode 255  with Rob Delaney and the ghost of Micheal Jackson (Mookie Blaiklock) was always my least favorite.  Mookie plays it too over the top and cliche and when Rob doesnt really get into it he goes even more over the top
comedybangbang,32tjcl,kgriffin44,14,Thu Apr 16 16:42:22 2015 UTC,Mookie's MJ impression kills me.  I can see why it would be grating but those 2 episodes never fail to make me laugh.  I actually think Mookie ramping up the ridiculousness when you can tell it's grating on Delaney makes that ep even funnier.

comedybangbang,32kn1d,bananabooks,20,Wed Apr 15 15:18:15 2015 UTC,"Here is the email I send to friends (obviously, this reflects my personal taste in CBB and everyone is a little different):  MY COMEDY BANG BANG STARTER KIT  AV Club's best Podcast of 2013  The podcast that launched its own TV show  Absurdity, stunning improv, anti-humor, terribly awesome puns, overly-complex canon... it's pretty much perfect. If you don't like it you're wrong and unfunny.  That said, it is an acquired taste, and for the uninitiated, a guide to entering the wonderful Aukerworld may be useful.  As a starting point, pretty much any episode involving Zach Galifinakis, Paul F. Tompkins, Andy Daly, or Horatio Sanz gets my seal of approval.  But, to give a more directive guide:  Step 1: These episodes don't really need much context, are some of my favorite episodes, and are all great entry points.   Episodes 173 (Ride like Hell) and particularly 189 (The Pancake Man) are two episodes that make delightful use of ""Werner Herzog"" Episode 191 (2012 Holiday Spectacular) has an appearance by ""Ice-T"" that is probably my favorite thing that has ever happened on the show Episode 148 (Wipeout) introduces ""Dalton Wilcox"" who is wonderful, with Jason Mantzoukas and Scott Aukerman Episode 150 and 215 - Time Bobby I and II, with ""Andrew Lloyd Webber"" Episode 233 (Royal Watching) Episode 192 (GoodFelines) - Ben Schwartz and ""Shelly Driftwood"" (I love Horatio Sanz so much) Episode 338 (Be My Guest, Literally!) - A recent and magical episode.  Episode 326 (2014 Holiday Spectacular) could be a helpful primer to introduce the ""Ho-ho"" character.   Step 2: Exploring various sides of CBB:  If you are into more... purple... humor:    Episode 255 (A Visit from Tee Hee) Episode 310 (Little Button Puss) Episode 176 (Out of Bleeps) - Very funny, but also important as a precursor to... Episode 243 (Blow Me Up Tom) - top 5 funniest episodes ever   If you are into anti-humor (and I am!), Harris Wittels (RIP) is your guy:   Episode 31 (Happy Black Friday!) (note - the podcast at this point is called ""Comedy Death Ray"") - the beginning of Harris's Foam Corner Episode 120 (Farts and Procreation) - one of the all time greats, historically beloved, spawned a number of sequels. Episode 156 (Anniversary Party) - Zach Galifinakis is one of my favorite guests, and LOVES Harris Episode 167 (New No-Nos) - Not Harris Wittels, but Paul Rust playing kind of a similar, more absurdist, role   Great characters:   Episode 46 (Curb Your Suicide Attempts) - More ""Ice-T"" Episodes 202, 248, 312 - Lauren Lapkus as Scott's nephew Todd  Episodes 12, 34, 194, 211 - El Chupacabra (and bonus! Jon Hamm) Episodes 224 (Live from Austin) and 241 (The Stallone Bros) - Bill Diesel Episodes 260, 301, 320, 326 and 346: Victor and Tiny   Heavy and dense character canon:   Intern Marissa Wompler: Episodes 60, 92, 116, 154, 156 (also mentioned above), 167 (also mentioned above), 178, 188 (with Judd Apatow), 218 (the Bachelor Brothers!), 220, and then most intensely, 238 and 304 (plus a few others). The saga of Gillian Jacobs and Garry Marshall - Episodes 180, 199, 222 (the best), 272. Most of Andy Daly's previous episodes, which build towards Episodes 274 (Oh Golly!) and 300 (Oh Golly! You Devil).  These are fan favorites but I personally think they are a little too dense."
comedybangbang,32kn1d,Mr_Viper,3,Tue Apr 14 21:51:23 2015 UTC,300 (Oh Golly! You Devil) was the first ep I listened to and it confused the HELL out of me. Came back to it a few weeks ago and laughed my ass off the entire time.

She plays characters like Traci Reardon, Scott's nephew Todd & Regina Crimp. One of the best I think is Ep. 287: Stinky Chips; in this one, she plays Mizz Chipz, a substitute teacher from ""the Greater Los Angeles Area"" who won't date ""former students"", which she defines as anyone who has ever been a student."

comedybangbang,323xwz,evilweevil666,2,Fri Apr 10 14:38:27 2015 UTC,"Permutation:       In mathematics, the notion of permutation relates to the act of rearranging, or permuting, all the members of a set into some sequence or order (unlike combinations, which are selections of some members of the set where order is disregarded). For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). As another example, an anagram of a word, all of whose letters are different, is a permutation of its letters. The study of permutations of finite sets is a topic in the field of combinatorics.

comedybangbang,31wplu,kthoag,7,Fri Apr 10 05:16:01 2015 UTC,The show I feel is too scripted. The podcast has a bit of real interview and discussion and a lot of raw comedy which I feel is more my personal taste.

comedybangbang,31wplu,SquidWithBatWings,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:03:04 2015 UTC,I agree when the podcast is hitting its peaks - I'm listening to Wipeout right now.

Some nice laughs but mostly misses. More unfunny than the first episode.  Maybe long-form improv is not my scene. Maybe it feels too forced at times, or too unstructured that almost no one is taking the lead, I dunno.  And I LOOOOOOOVE PFT. I've heard his CBB episodes 3 times AT LEAST.

Two Thumbs and Not Much Else is personally one of my favorite episodes, so I'm going for that one. Farts and Pro 1 may be the best one, or if not the best of the 4, a very important episode in CBB history. However, Benny Schawz and a stellar performance by PFT's best characs + 4 Cantina songs cannot be beat.  The hardest match-up for me today, but I have to give it to Out of Bleeps because this was THE episode that hooked me into CBB. All 4 people in the room played off each other so well, especially Amy and ""Tom."" Tom singing his radio theme at the end of the rap battle is one of my favorite moments.  Wipeout for sure.   Time Bobby beats out a great Cake Boss episode, and the introduction of H.R. Gieger and Rev. Parsimony makes it a classic, but Time Bobby is just a stellar episode all around (even though I prefer Time Bobby 2)."

Any of James Adomian's characters. I love how mean-spirited and spot-on his Tom Leykis impersonation is. Huell Howser and Paul Giamatti are also great.  I also love Matt Besser's Bjork."

I remember the SNL Reunion episode being pretty awkward, mainly because Casey Wilson had just gotten fired from SNL either that day or very shortly before the taping. Any of the Heidecker episodes are super awkward.   It seems pretty hit or miss when the guest is new, some ""get"" the show and some just can't latch on. I felt that way about Alex Borstein, even though the episode turned out pretty good."

comedybangbang,305u1k,Gonoan,2,Wed Mar 25 13:25:18 2015 UTC,The Musicians never really participate in the conversations. Also it gets annoying with them playing music before the break.
comedybangbang,305u1k,OfficerTwix,3,Sat Mar 28 01:42:43 2015 UTC,"One of the worst things that can happen is when a guest isn't on board for Would You Rather. It really brings everything to a screeching halt. And the listener can pick up on Scott's annoyance and then him exasperatingly trying to save the bit.   Examples off the top of my head of people who aren't on board at all for WWR include Tig Notaro on the recent live ep, Bill Hader in July 2013, and Tim Heidecker (various eps). So I would toss those episodes, and any others were WWR gets ruined, in the ""worst"" category."
comedybangbang,305u1k,downwithlevers,3,Thu Mar 26 15:40:42 2015 UTC,Agree with the fact that Bill Hader didn't seem into what was going on in the show which broke my heart because he's one of my favorite comedic actors. I think the silliness of CBB just isn't for everyone which is a bummer.
comedybangbang,305u1k,temporarychair,8,Fri Mar 27 03:19:50 2015 UTC,"I honestly couldn't say. Sometimes guests just aren't funny, sometimes things get really derailed, and sometimes it just sounds like the group there might be tired that day. I'm not sure on an absolute worst episode; I feel like most of the mediocre ones are ones that I essentially forget right after hearing.  I like Tim Heidecker, but I don't see why he comes on the podcast when he's mostly confrontational or against the basic parts of the podcast (like WYR? and a lot of times Scott tries to ask actual interview questions). The Guy Fieri episode stands out to me as a bad one.  EDIT: I'm a fan of Tim's work, I know it's a bit. I just wish those episodes had characters/actors who were more into what was going on rather than his character being on."
comedybangbang,305u1k,evuldave,15,Tue Mar 24 19:25:30 2015 UTC,"Tim Heidecker is pretty much always in character, like when he pretended to be a Herman Cain supporter and released an entire album about it. I see his character on CBB as an extension of his Twitter account, his stand up, and On Cinema At The Cinema. From that perspective I find his episodes pretty enjoyable, though I imagine it could go the other way if you don't assume it's all in good fun."
comedybangbang,305u1k,amazing_rando,6,Tue Mar 24 20:09:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually usually like his bits and I'm surprised people can't tell that it's a schtick. The episode where he's ""touring"" with the Who and selling John Ent-Whistles is great. The way the interview slowly meanders around into him just being a moocher that the Who actually hates is amazingly well done. ""If I see you around again with those fucking whistles!"""

comedybangbang,305u1k,duphre,6,Wed Mar 25 20:10:29 2015 UTC,"With Tim Heidecker I always wonder if him being confrontational is just a bit that the listener isn't privy to, or if he is serious."

comedybangbang,305u1k,Jsm00v3,2,Wed Mar 25 15:40:07 2015 UTC,There was an episode with Rob Delaney some time in the last year that was really awkward and un-fun. Probably during his book tour. I was surprised how unwilling he was to go along with the bits.
comedybangbang,305u1k,Ed_Sullivision,4,Wed Mar 25 16:34:08 2015 UTC,Are you talking about the Michael Jackson (hee-hee) episode? Rob was definitely not game for Mookie's terrible(amazing) MJ charac. Which is a shame because that MJ character really killed it on the Jerrod Carmichael episode.
comedybangbang,305u1k,Jsm00v3,2,Wed Mar 25 18:43:52 2015 UTC,The Michael Jackson character is such an anomaly because it seems like it would be a complete hack character but Mookie makes it so funny for whatever reason. It's funny under like 2 layers of irony or whatever.   But if I were introducing a friend to CBB that would still be one of the last episodes I would consider recommending because it makes the show seem no different from a morning zoo-crew show upon first impression.
comedybangbang,305u1k,Virginonimpossible,2,Thu Mar 26 17:02:23 2015 UTC,"Oh I absolutely agree. I probably only enjoyed it because I was familiar with Mookie's work at UCB, so I knew what was coming. Also, the constant references to him being in a fat, white guy body really helped lessen the hackiness.  I do agree that I would never use an MJ ep as a jumping-off point for a new listener. I'd usually just pick a solid PFT or Zouks/Daly ep."
comedybangbang,305u1k,Count_Critic,2,Thu Mar 26 17:12:21 2015 UTC,"The ones that come to mind for me are the Pete Holmes episode, I already had a love/hate thing with Pete from Doug Loves Movies.   The Jay Mohr episode, not the best Matt Besser character as it was a play on him being a new dad in real life, could have been better with a different guest.  I can't remember which episode but there was a kerfuffle about one of Pam Murphy's episodes, I personally think she is fine."

It was like the first one I listened to, now I'm listening to like ten :p  The host of CBB created a whole network of podcasts called Earwolf (The wolf dead!) and a lot of Earwolf podcasts have very similar guests/types of comedy. You might like or love:   The Andy Daly Podcast Pilot Project Analyze Phish U Talkin' U2 To Me? improv4humans   Give them a try sometime, maybe!

Dig through the free episodes on Earwolf, and find a few guests you like (the Scott Aukerman episodes are always great!) and get your feet wet. Jimmy Pardo is hilarious and the show is always great, but much like CBB, it's a different level of amazing when you have a reference for the running jokes and when they have an exceptionally great guest."

Each episode has ""opening statements"" which is usually an absurdist bit, then at the end they do the ""jokes"" segment, which is Norm, his sidekick, and their guest reading absurd or over-the-top offensive jokes off of cards."

The Andy Daly Podcast Pilot Project The Dead Authors Podcast   Others have discusses the first two but I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned the last one. Paul F Tompkins hosts The Dead Authors Podcast and has comedian guests play the characters of dead authors. I would suggest episodes 13, 14, 24, 26, 34 and 38 as the showcases of how great the podcast is."

It can be frustrating when the guest is great but the sound is awful.   One of my favorites is the one you mentioned, 34, where Ben Schwartz is Roald Dahl.

I definitely see why you'd think it was that one though! The one I'm thinking of I listened to somewhere between 1-2 weeks ago.

comedybangbang,2x9tdp,trainsaw,11,Fri Feb 27 00:59:42 2015 UTC,"There are alot of angles to look at it. First and foremost Harris probably wouldn't give a shit, he'd more than likely be pro for it. And all proceeds go towards a scholarship in his name. On the other hand, its promoting their TV Show/Podcast in his memory, if they were collecting profits I'd have a problem with that. But if they threw his name on there I wouldn't be thrilled with it either as it'd seem like they were using his name to promote.   All in all, they're taking something he said, honoring him, giving the profits away and still providing a shirt that can promote a show later on down the road that he was a huge part of."

comedybangbang,2x43v7,HardAsIs,13,Wed Feb 25 14:29:54 2015 UTC,I heard that someone on the P&R team died before listening to the CBB episode and had no clue it was Harris. I started listening to the episode Monday morning having no clue that it was Harris and my heart sank.   Scott's eulogy was perfect. The episode was hilarious and I'm very happy that it was posted in remembrance of Harris.   RIP Harris!
comedybangbang,2x43v7,SamZABAR,5,Wed Feb 25 18:27:59 2015 UTC,"This is heartbreaking.  Harris is a huge loss to the alternative comedy community (do they even call it that anymore).  I've been re-listening to all the Harris on CBB and even on Who Charted (not crazy about that show).  He is so damn funny.    Thank you for everything, Harris.  Truth be told, I liked Phish before, but you certainly helped."
comedybangbang,2x43v7,teknique37,2,Wed Feb 25 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah ""alternative"" is pretty much mainstream now.

comedybangbang,2x1s4g,Microtiger,4,Wed Feb 25 01:00:49 2015 UTC,If you like Andy Daly watch his show Review on Comedy Central. PFT has a bunch of podcasts too for whenever you get through the CBB episodes you want to listen to.
comedybangbang,2x1s4g,PaulCoffee77,3,Wed Feb 25 02:08:46 2015 UTC,"I did much the same thing but worse! (Keep in mind I was 17 at the time, though it's still no excuse.) It took me multiple episodes to realize the guests were just improvised characters. First episode I heard was Andy Daly pretending to be a nurse who abused old people and locked them in closets all night to die. I still didn't even get it after I heard Iced Tea call from a hot-air balloon repping his Small POC blanket he invented. And I thought Marrissa Wompler was really a 16 y/o girl.

comedybangbang,2x0vpl,mathfacts,12,Tue Feb 24 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"Lil bit of a looping nerd here: It appears the Cudi Will still have the Electro-Harmonix 45000 multi track looper in his setup. This is pretty much the heart of reggies setup (combined with the line 6 DL4 for those curious). Instead of using his voice and keys exclusively, Cudi will use a digital workstation to get his sounds, and most likely the samples for his loops. He has a drum machine there too which would lead to more options for live looping / improvisational music opportunities.  I'm happy to see that they're leaving room for live looping at all in the setup, hopefully it will still maintain the organic and dynamic precedence that Redge' sets!  Definitely not going to be as impromptu and I'd guess there's going to be a lot more 'pre-baked' loops coming through this way. (you can save loops in the EH45000 and bring them up whenever.)  What was that? you didn't ask about any of this? Oh well."

comedybangbang,2x0vpl,ksaid1,4,Tue Feb 24 20:46:53 2015 UTC,If you get the CBB dvds and watch Reggie's supercuts you'll see most of his sounds and beats are mostly made with his mouth. He makes a series of layers before the cut and then will sometimes add the Keyboard on top of it. You're right though that he definitely implement the keyboard a lot more on the show than in performances I've seen!

Then I found out about Harris last night and have been in such a funk since. I checked on the new ep of CBB first thing this morning because I figured Scott would at the very least have to address this tragedy, but I definitely was not expecting to see Farts and Pro 4 released so soon.    That intro made me cry on the bus to work, but as soon as the episode itself started I was laughing again. Can't wait to listen to the rest of it.    Anyway, god dammit. Harris was my favorite comedian and always someone I would have loved to be friends with. Can't say I ever expected to cry over the death of someone I never knew, but then again, I think anyone who listened to his podcasting work knew him to a degree. You'll be missed, Harris. You were one of the best."
comedybangbang,2wupb6,WhosCountin,4,Mon Feb 23 20:10:26 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you're saying. My cynical, arrogant self always rolled my eyes at the reactions to celebrity deaths, like ""psh you guys didn't know them, stop overreacting"" but with Harris I was genuinely sad, feeling like I lost someone close to me. Maybe it's the intimate nature of podcasts that caused that, but damn I was (and still am) so bummed. What a fucking tragedy. I'm actually annoyed with myself because of how much I've let this eat away at me."

It just ended and I'm still bawling right now - I think the hardest part was hearing how hard everyone was laughing in all of those clips. The world needs more laughter, and Harris was one of the best sources out there.    It does feel silly to sit here crying about someone who I've never even seen in person, but (like a lot of you) Comedy Bang! Bang! has gotten me through some of the toughest times in my life, and Harris was a big part of that. I just wish someone had been there to do the same for him."
comedybangbang,2wupb6,WhosCountin,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:38:16 2015 UTC,Hearing how he had just got a big job and was rising in his career sounds like he was celebrating with a traitorous friend Harry and went too far rather than doing it out of depression.

What a bizarre connection to make.  Put a million comedians in a room and I guarantee you only Harris goes down that path.  I usually hate when people over-analyze comedy, but I think that ability to make strange connections to disparate ideas like that is what separates the truly creative from the rest.  Maybe what I'm saying is pretty obvious, but I'm convinced that's why he was such a good comedy writer.  Anyway, this is really sad.

I was checking my podcast que this morning and saw who was on the episode and also saw the ""WTF"" episode title ""remembering Harris Wittels"", and quickly started googling what happened.   Like usual, I was bummed out. But when I listened to the episode I realized just how much I liked Harris. How every appearance on the show and all his other work brought me so much joy and laughter. Over the years it felt like we had all really gotten to know him. He would  come on the show and just be himself, which of course was was incredibly funny.  These realizations led me to actually shed a tear over someone I didn't know personally. I never thought that would happen to me. But he was such a wonderful, funny, clever, and open man. It really felt like losing buddy.  Harris was incredibly important to me and I didn't even know it. I can't even imagine how people who knew him feel right now. My heart goes out to Scott, the CCB crew, Harris's friends, and most of all his family. I've been robbed of future chuckles. But they've been robbed of a friend.  I'm glad Scott put this episode out. While it made me sad knowing this was the last little bit of Harris we would get, it also made me laugh. And motherfuckers wanna laugh.  Hopefully Cakeboss (cakeboss) will be able to go into a tranch and communicate with Harris on the other side. Though I'm afraid it may be even beyond his power's. :("

comedybangbang,2wupb6,cuttups,3,Tue Feb 24 00:30:17 2015 UTC,Scott was kind of shitting on this episode but goddamn even without the extra significance of Harris's death I still was laughing harder than I have in a long time.

Scott was genuinely offended it seemed like when Harris said nobody wants to play your stupid games.    Also, that bit was struggling way to hard and I felt Scott felt pressure to get them off of it.  It ended up being ""ok"", but I think I agree with Scott that the personal email reading was pretty lame concept in general."

comedybangbang,2wupb6,TheSomnambulist,2,Tue Feb 24 23:42:47 2015 UTC,I teared up when I saw Harris' name on the episode. I really didn't expect this and it was an amazing episode too. That voicemail at the very end... what a great little slice of Harris. You will be missed man.

""Mother fuckers just wanna laugh"" damn Harris really got it.   Just have to say though that I hate it when Scott calls this a stupid show. This show really has brought a lot of laughs to my life, and a good bit of those came from Harris. And yeah the humor is silly but that is what makes this podcast so great and unique, so many comedians have podcasts and so many of them are just fucking therapy sessions, political soapboxes, or boring interview shows, this one makes me laugh and helps me get past all the shit in the world. It was apparent the power of this podcast when earlier this week I was listening to the Harris shows and I started off sad but by the end I was cracking up as always. I can't say that about any other show out there. IMO this show is just pure comedy no trappings of pretension or whatever else. This show is amazing and it kind of makes me a bit sad that maybe Scott doesn't always see how great it is or the positive power that it brings. This episode is proof of that. Thanks again!"
comedybangbang,2wupb6,DocSub,1 point,Tue Feb 24 03:46:07 2015 UTC,"THIS EPISODE WAS SO FUNNY.   What heartbreak though. Scott almost made me cry with his intro.

Then I often went to the episodes that are mentioned in those episodes through callbacks or references.  If you just do that then you'll kind of just naturally listen to the ones that you want to.
comedybangbang,2wqzg6,stinatown,3,Mon Feb 23 04:21:32 2015 UTC,"I started listening about two years ago. I started with some episodes that have been mentioned (I think my first was Time Bobby) but I got hooked by listening to episodes that had guests I had heard of and liked--John Mulaney, Andy Samburg, Amy Poehler, etc. It made the episodes a little more accessible. At the same time, I started listening to the new episodes each week as well."

comedybangbang,2wqzg6,kingofdanger,2,Sun Feb 22 21:55:13 2015 UTC,"All of the eps listed are great, but honestly I would start with episodes with people you already like in them.  I started with the Paul Rudd/Ken Marino/David Wain one to get my feet wet and expanded from there."
comedybangbang,2wqzg6,indorock,2,Mon Feb 23 06:12:34 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on your personal taste. There are some regular guests who are excellent at characters, others at improv (a number are great at both) and then some who don't do much of either but are funny in their own right (Benny Schwaz and Harris Wittels to name 2). I think any Paul F. Tompkins episode is worth a listen, my favorite characters of his are JW Stillwater and Gary Marshall, but one episode that had me in tears was with him and Rob Corddry where PFT plays the disfigured assassin from Boardwalk Empire.  Also the musical guests they have, you'd expect them to be all about the music and not much up their sleeves by way of comedy but they might surprise you. Jack Antonof from Fun. was such a case.  Long story  short, hit shuffle, see where you end up if you like pursue those guests more if not try a new batch."

Like I love Kroll Show, Parks, etc so the Oh Hello guys from last month was amazing, and the Harris Wittels stuff the last couple days because of the circumstances. If you like certain people those are probably the best to start with. I can't give specific episodes though as I've only listened to around 10-15 so far."
comedybangbang,2wqzg6,carbonite_duckface,1 point,Mon Feb 23 08:27:00 2015 UTC,Episode 174 is a good one. It is the second appearance of characters Gil Faizon (Nick Kroll) and George St Geegland (John Mulaney). Lizzy Caplin (she recently played the woman from the CIA in 'The interview').

The fact that you found CBB in the first place seems to say you're into alternative comedy. There's probably tons of episodes containing at least one actor/comedian or musician you think is cool.   I'd say start from there and see if you like it and then you can explore the backlog a bit deeper"
comedybangbang,2wqzg6,K9H20,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:30:10 2015 UTC,"I would start at the beginning. It was funny from the start, with frequent appearances from Nick Kroll, James Adomian,  etc. Plus lots of riffs become in-jokes that are refenced later."
comedybangbang,2wqzg6,GammaTainted,2,Sun Feb 22 21:03:00 2015 UTC,"I would say it doesn't necessarily settle in until like episode 10. Earlier episodes are more actual interviews and less character-driven improv. Still, after listening to about 15 episodes, I ended up going back to the start so I could see where all the jokes came from. So I recommend starting from episode one as well."

I've never been so affected by the death of someone I never met. I'm so sad, and I feel so badly for Harris's family, Scott, Sarah, Aziz, and everyone else that knew him.   I've been listening to his CBB appearances, Don't Stop or We'll Die's music, and Analyze Phish whenever I can ever since I heard the news. He was effortlessly funny and simply CBB's - and even all of comedy's - most endearing personality.   I finally got around to listening to his You Made It Weird appearance. It really hit me when he said this about Robin Williams:    No, it is sad. It’s sad when anyone dies. Even though every single human dies, so it’s really not that sad. It’s sad to not get his comedy anymore. And it’s sad for his family.    RIP, Harris."

comedybangbang,2w81ry,ElectricMarmalade,23,Wed Feb 18 03:19:43 2015 UTC,Have you ever heard of Herzog having a humscalade and hating everything about the environment. Or have you heard Gary Marshall demand people call him Gary? These and completely fantastical versions of the people he's impersonating. They're purposefully rediculous.
comedybangbang,2w81ry,MrFusionHER,1 point,Wed Feb 18 04:50:10 2015 UTC,On the contrary yourself. I think my point was to just enjoy the comedy and not think about it to much. Who gives a shit if his impression sounds dead on or if he sounds nothing like him. It makes us laugh.
comedybangbang,2w81ry,MrFusionHER,1 point,Fri Feb 20 06:54:25 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem like anyone is insulting, they're merely curious as to why when he's accurate with other impersonations, this one he just does something different"
comedybangbang,2w81ry,OneOfDozens,1 point,Fri Feb 20 11:34:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of the time it is funnier if you know details about the character though, for example it wouldn't be nearly as amusing if you thought Fitzcarraldo was a joke made up by PFT. Werner Herzog really is a maniac and that makes it funnier, to me.   I know nothing about Len Wiseman so I don't get the take yet, or if there is a specific take. I guess it is to do with PFT's love of cryptozoology (lycans etc)."
comedybangbang,2w81ry,Virginonimpossible,1 point,Fri Feb 20 15:16:31 2015 UTC,"I know nothing about Len Wiseman so I don't get the take yet   Personally, to me, that's kind of the point. Nobody knows anything about Len Wiseman, so PFT can do whatever he wants with him. I see it as like a meta-joke about how little we know about Len Wiseman (or Garry Marshall, Werner Herzog, or Cakeboss, all of whom I know ""exist"", but none of whom I really know anything about). It's almost more freeing than doing something that is heavily grounded in reality."
comedybangbang,2w81ry,bananabooks,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:56:11 2015 UTC,"I get your point and agree this is definitely true with James Adomian's characters, sometimes they make several appearance before I realize they are based on actual people.   With PFT though I enjoy the 'inside' jokes that most people wouldn't get unless you know a little bit about the real person, or at least you question whether that is something Werner Herzog etc actually did/said.  I think it was someone else who once said ""comedy is one of them things where like, you can sometimes like things but other people will like other things."" :)"

He needs someone who he can play off of, and Scott has amazing chemistry with him.  Comedy Central should be keeping a close eye on PFT, the Choctaw and the whole CBB universe. With Colbert and now JStew calling it quits they may need to look in another direction for programming. Even if new hosts and shows work out there would still be a place for a PFT/Scotty Auks vehicle. A new Variety show on a cable network, filmed live nightly. If done correctly it could be the best thing on television."

The three Time Bobby episodes, obviously. And of course Farts and Procreation.

The guy in the band who was a CBB fan was how I imagine your average CBB fan would act if they were on the show. Innocently charming, occasionally funny, gets it, but ultimately a musician and not a comedian who can keep up, which is way more than most music guests. Pretty much how I (and probably most of us) would act.  That said I was excited that two of /mu/'s loves were colliding (/mu/ LOVES American Football and Scott Aukerman)."
comedybangbang,2rqiap,crudmeal,7,Fri Jan 9 07:49:31 2015 UTC,"Handford's John Lennon was so funny to me. He'd say the simplest, silliest thing (eg, the bit about parking his RV at Walmart) and I'd crack up.   Also, the plug song incident with Anders was pretty great.  The band was a bit quiet for most of it, but they were game during WYR and their songs were nice (I'd never heard of them before this)."

comedybangbang,2rqiap,Jsm00v3,3,Thu Jan 8 20:42:18 2015 UTC,To be fair they were stripped down versions of songs they wrote in the 90s. Kind of a niche band though.
comedybangbang,2rqiap,blahblahblahdkjdfgj,3,Thu Jan 15 17:47:43 2015 UTC,"Ders sounded sick which is a shame because he definitely seemed off his game, almost bored or annoyed at times. Scott was definitely working hard but it's like that when he has musical guests sometimes. Not a greppisode but not a disaster. They need to get all the Workaholics on at once."

comedybangbang,2rqiap,blahblahblahdkjdfgj,3,Thu Jan 8 17:27:44 2015 UTC,I'm surprised that The Birthday Boys members aren't on more. Like 4 of them write for CBBTV so they're obviously tight with Scott and everything.

The ending of the episode really moved me, because I really felt a connection with Scott and Paul when they were thanking everyone and us the fans and mentioning how people write in to them all the time, telling them how this podcast helps them out. Paul said something to the effect of ""life is always a little bit hard"" and if CBB can make people smile or laugh or cure people from the clap, then that is meaningful to these two guys. I really got the sense they were appreciative of that, and I'm very tempted to write my first fan mail ever to them. I really want to let them know that this podcast has helped me as well.

He's not funny, he doesn't do any good characters (Gutterballs is really just a support character in the Womp-verse). His voice...irritates me, and not just the volume of it. He ruined The League with his annoying character Rafi, and on How Did This Get Made? he dominates the conversation and does 80% of the talking in his obnoxious way. He's a drag."

comedybangbang,2qqx29,tequilasauer,-2,Tue Dec 30 04:59:56 2014 UTC,"I love this episode, but I refused to listen to it on the Best Of and skipped forward. I basically challenged myself to see if I knew it all the way through and when I had it, I skipped forward feeling like I'd earned it."
comedybangbang,2qrfnd,kristopherm3,11,Mon Dec 29 23:58:56 2014 UTC,"The podcast follows a formula which is similar to but different from the TV show. There's usually at least two guests, one of which is a celebrity guest who appears as themselves, and a comedian or celebrity appears as a character to interrupt the interview. They riff for a while in character, and then there are usually a couple improv games that are played. These include:   Would You Rather? - Scott gives two ridiculous scenarios and then opens the floor for questions. The scenarios get more and more ridiculous as more questions are asked, then people vote on which they would rather do, and Scott awards arbitrary points.  What Am I Thinking? - two people say two different random words at the same time, then try to figure out the word that those two things have in common, and say it at the same time again. They win if they say the same word simultaneously.  Freestyle Rap Battle - guests rap about a random topic.  The Riddler Game - guests come up with a random riddle or joke with no answer, then everyone comes up with their own answer and votes on whose was best.    Then they do the segment which the podcast is most well-known and loved for, the Plugs section. This is where guests talk about what new and exciting movies, TV shows, and books they have coming out, and where you can see them perform live.   Basically the main difference is that the podcast is wholly improvised. The TV show seems at least somewhat scripted, but I'm not sure to what extent."
comedybangbang,2qrfnd,myshadowinvain,12,Tue Dec 30 00:26:15 2014 UTC,"The ""riddler game"" is actually called Riddle Me This.  boom boom-psst boom-boom. Riddler."

comedybangbang,2qrfnd,stiljo24,8,Fri Jan 16 03:39:37 2015 UTC,"The TV show seems at least somewhat scripted, but I'm not sure to what extent.    I heard the scenes from the couch are primarily improvised, but they are of course edited which changes the vibe inherently.  If a joke falls totally flat it just gets cut instead of getting ""yes and""ed.  So yea I agree that's the main difference.  Related is that while the podcast is extremely goofy and carefree, once every handful of episodes a non-joke discussion will break out."
comedybangbang,2qrfnd,Antonton,1 point,Tue Dec 30 01:53:50 2014 UTC,"In the Best Of pt. 4, Scott said that the TV show has to have a few more specific beats and points to hit. They don't have as much time, so even though it's mostly improved, they do have to have a little bit more structure and direction. The podcast is obviously much more friendly to aimless meandering and extended character development."
comedybangbang,2qrfnd,HardAsIs,9,Sun Jan 4 09:22:15 2015 UTC,"To me the podcast feels way less structured and more improvised. I'm sure there's some riffing/improv on tv, but it feels very scripted at points. Listening to the Best Of this year, Scott seems to pride himself on the fact that often the guests have very little planned. That's why I prefer the podcast to the show. But to each their own."

comedybangbang,2qrfnd,bandola,8,Tue Dec 30 23:48:59 2014 UTC,"I just wanted to add a few things in addition to what others have mentioned here (completely improvised, games, plugs):   No Reggie Watts (unless he's the celebrity guest) No scripted sketches of any kind. It's just an interview/talk with the celebrity guest and improv characters. I think this is a good thing since I don't really find the sketches on the TV show to be that funny. Since nothing is planned, the whole episode can spiral way out of control or generally be about something very strange. This kind of strangeness is what gives the podcast a feeling of something truly excellent. We get great, weird, inside jokes. We get strange characters that we learn to love. We get catchphrases that wouldn't mean anything to other people but would make us laugh out loud if they came back (examples Solo Bolo, technicality-no-down-boo-over, Cakeboss!).  Listening to it can make you feel like you're part of the conversation and some episodes are just GOLD.    It's really hard to compare the podcast to the TV show really, because they are so different. You really have to listen to it to find out."

Otherwise I'd go with pretty much any episode where Paul F Tompkins or Andy Daly is in. They both have some funny characters. It's also of course funnier if the celebrity guest is someone you like, so that's up to you to pick."

comedybangbang,2pthad,thlsisnotanexit,7,Sat Dec 20 02:49:06 2014 UTC,My speculative hunch when I heard it was Scott isn't too happy about it. As it kept getting called back throughout the podcast he never embraced the bit (Which is out of character) and really seemed to not want to discuss it.  But this is wild speculation and I'm not a news network so I'll admit I'm talking out of my ass.
comedybangbang,2pthad,PopWhatMagnitude,5,Fri Dec 19 22:55:50 2014 UTC,"yeah...like i said before, what stuck with me was scott saying it was a conversation for backstage. he could have very easily said something about being proud of reggie for his new gig, but didn't. it makes me wonder if it's a similar situation to joan rivers and johnny carson back in the 80s, when she got her own show and he found out through the media, he got offended that she didn't tell him herself and never spoke to her again.  i should say i'm not looking to trade gossip here, it was just something i noticed and was curious if others noticed too."
comedybangbang,2pthad,dystopika,1 point,Sat Dec 20 02:25:17 2014 UTC,"I really wish there were video footage so we could see Scott's reactions to the riffing during this show.  He was uncharacteristically silent during the prodding about Reggie, but he could have been laughing.  He could have been nervously laughing.  He could have been stone-faced.  Yes, he sent out a congratulatory tweet about Reggie moving on but I'm sure he's endeavoring to keep things positive in public.  Comedy Bang Bang is Scott Aukerman -- so I'm not worried about the show creatively -- but the show has been firmly established with the Scott and Reggie characters and this completely disrupts that dynamic.  There's no way he's not upset -- I'm just curious HOW upset.  And a guy like the Chocktaw doesn't often give serious interviews, so it might be difficult to ever really know unless you're part of that camp."
comedybangbang,2pthad,Virginonimpossible,7,Sun Dec 21 14:39:30 2014 UTC,"I hope Jenny Lewis takes over from Reggie, just for the sake of continuity."
comedybangbang,2pthad,gin-n-tonic,3,Sun Dec 21 18:17:41 2014 UTC,It happens at the 1:05:40 mark on the episode and I feel like it's a fresh wound for him. I know he's psyched for his friend but it hinders something great that was building some wonderful speed for the both of them.   Pardo does ask him again about 1:07:00 mark but its just a joke to further push the point.
comedybangbang,2pthad,barrist,5,Sat Dec 20 20:34:14 2014 UTC,Maybe it's just me but for me I thought he was just joking around pretending to be upset ?
comedybangbang,2pthad,mr_goo0se,11,Sat Dec 20 00:49:01 2014 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, but for me, I don't think so."
comedybangbang,2pthad,dustinyo_,3,Sat Dec 20 01:24:32 2014 UTC,"Scott seemed happy for him on twitter. I think it's more likely that Scott's attitude about it on the show was a bit. I can't believe he'd be anything but happy for Reggie, this is a huge opportunity for him."
comedybangbang,2pthad,ShockinglyEfficient,1 point,Sat Dec 20 19:41:35 2014 UTC,"If I made a show with my friend and my friend left to join a ""better"" show, I would be more than a little miffed. I can definitely believe he'd be anything but happy. Ultimately though I think Scott is a bigger man than I am. Literally, he's like 6 4 or something"
comedybangbang,2pthad,dustinyo_,0,Tue Dec 23 15:22:59 2014 UTC,"Whether it's a ""better"" show or not isn't really relevant, he's moving from IFC to major network TV. It's an enormous step up both in visibility and I'm sure in paychecks. I guarantee Scott would leave IFC in a heartbeat if one of the major networks offered him a show. He'd be crazy not to."
comedybangbang,2pthad,ShockinglyEfficient,0,Tue Dec 23 15:51:38 2014 UTC,"Do you think he'd drop Comedy Bing Bong that easily? Just for some sitcom on FX or something? I think it's more likely that he'd move the show to HBO or Showtime rather than drop it altogether. But IFC isn't stupid, they're gonna want CBB to stick around for the long haul. As far as Reggie goes, I wish him the best, I just think it's maybe a little disingenuous to only have stuck around because there wasn't anything better to be on. But then again, I'm not in show business so I don't have that ambition perspective"

comedybangbang,2pthad,PukeHammer,2,Tue Dec 23 15:20:21 2014 UTC,Don't know of anything specific but I always got the impression that Scott didn't like Reggie whenever he was a guest on the podcast. The recent Tears for Fears episode is a good example.
comedybangbang,2pthad,ShockinglyEfficient,3,Fri Dec 19 21:10:58 2014 UTC,"I never got that impression.  If anything, I would say the only reason Reggie got the part and guest host slots was because Scott likes him.  Reggie isn't particularly funny, if you ask me."
comedybangbang,2pthad,LtCommanderBooya,2,Fri Dec 19 23:57:18 2014 UTC,I've always been a little confused as to Reggie's involvement in the show. What does he really do that someone else can't do? Its more Paul F Tompkins than it is Reggie Watts who makes Comedy Bang Bang what it is

comedybangbang,2pegae,crudmeal,3,Mon Dec 15 21:52:59 2014 UTC,I am going to guess it was an episode with Mary Lynn Rajskub in it.
comedybangbang,2pc9lo,GammaTainted,5,Mon Dec 15 07:28:14 2014 UTC,There was a block of episodes where he would call himself a few different Native American nicknames (the Apache and the Arapaho I think we're two of them) and Choctaw I guess was one that stuck. I'm not sure the origin of why he was using the Indian names but that's how I remember it unfolding.
comedybangbang,2pc9lo,frponkus,3,Mon Dec 15 18:28:29 2014 UTC,"I could have sworn there was an ep where Scott introduced himself as ""The Choctaw"" and Wompler groaned at him, so I thought it was from before then.

They have known about the 40 episode run for a while now, and these writers seem to be really interested in doing something ""different"" with the powers TV has to offer.

comedybangbang,2l6lbn,ksaid1,5,Mon Nov 3 19:13:37 2014 UTC,"I didn't understand how someone could not love Lil' Gary, until I heard Victor and Tiny. I hate them so much, Brendon's voices are just so incredibly grating to me that I can't bear to listen.  It's easy to say ""The comedy is so good that it's worth getting over the annoying voice,"" but if you actually experience that level of annoyance, you'll realise that getting over it is just not possible. So having Lil' Gary in an episode effectively means that some people just will never listen to that episode, and miss out on all the other good parts of it too.  And that makes it even worse. If you were really looking forward to hearing, I dunno, Nick Kroll or whoever, but Lil' Gary is in the episode, you resent Lil' Gary for ruining that sweet sweet Kroll.  Like I said, I love Lil' Gary, but I understand why some people hate him."
comedybangbang,2l6lbn,beau-tie,12,Mon Nov 3 19:21:51 2014 UTC,It's funny how opposite I feel to this haha. I never find Lil Gary funny and I've always thought it just sounded like a bad Cartman impression. While Victor and Tiny are some of my favorite characters. Sometimes a voice can just can hit a nerve that's hard to get past. I definitely wouldn't avoid listening to an episode because Lil Gary is in it though. Just might roll my eyes a few times ha.

comedybangbang,2kdkph,bloodflart,3,Mon Oct 27 01:57:08 2014 UTC,"It was great! The reason last year got some hate, (I wasn't there), but the festival was held at the Santa Monica Pier. Not only was it a bit uncomfortable to get around, but it was difficult to get the right sound for the stages because it's a pier. I don't think many festivals have gone on at that magnitude before. At least that's what I heard. This year however was amazing! It was at the Shire in LA and it was perfect for this festival. The sound was great, and there was plenty of space. My only complaint was how short the sets were for each act. Between the two stages, each act had roughly 30 mins each. But obviously given how many people were playing, that's how they had to structure it. DethKlok played for about 45 mins, which bummed me out a bit. But honestly, I thought it was worth it!"

comedybangbang,2jz95i,neggie,11,Tue Nov 11 05:12:36 2014 UTC,Episode 12 is a cracker start to finish. There's a few prior that are good but I feel this is the episode that they found their groove in.  Episodes featuring Jason mantzoukas and Andy Daly should be listened to in order as well as any Jessica St Clair and Lennon Parnham episodes. Farts and procreation and time bobby trilogies obviously. Other than that everything else can be listened to at random.   The in jokes tend to start in the January episodes (as if they are new years resolutions) and particularly with PFT.  I first jumped in with episodes featuring people I had heard of and from there found new favourites.

comedybangbang,2jz95i,CrouchJr,9,Thu Oct 23 09:39:46 2014 UTC,"I would say do the best ofs, then do your favorite guests, then maybe start at around ep 100 or so and move forward. After that if you still have a strong interest in the show go back and start at ep 1 and get the earlier episodes.  There is some value in listening chronologically, but you do not have to, and the earliest episodes might not draw in a new listener very well."

comedybangbang,2jz95i,TBD3,2,Wed Oct 22 15:07:33 2014 UTC,"I'm currently doing so. If I were to do it again, I'd probably just listen to the ones that had one of the following guests: Paul F. Tompkins, James Adomian, Andy Daly, Harris Wittels, and Jessica St. Clair.   I'm at about episode 200 so I can't advise you on how to go on from there, but those comedians always bring it."
comedybangbang,2jz95i,stiljo24,2,Wed Oct 22 19:25:49 2014 UTC,"I went through and listened to all of the ones with guests I was particularly interested in hearing.  Probably listened to 80 or so.  Then, in doing that, I discovered Tompkins, Adomian, Lapkus and Daly.  Then I had to go back and listen to everything they were in.  (Also Harris Wittels, but that's more of a personal thing, not someone I'd necessarily recommend to a random person whose taste I don't know).  Oh and the Time Bobby eps.  Amazing."

The best in that series, if you ask me.  Episode 274, Oh, Golly! With Jason Mantzoukas, and Andy Daly as Gil and Golly. Gil is a ventriloquist, and Golly is his dummy with a dark secret. Another great Mantzoukas-Daly episode.  Episode 285, Solo Bolo With Ben Schwartz. When Scott and Ben get together, sparks fly. Expect a lot of singing, ridiculous bits, and improv scenes that go on for about ten minutes too long.  Episode 286, Time Bobby 3 With Paul F Tompkins as Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Bobby Moynihan as a mysterious old man. It has all the classic bits you'd expect from a Time Bobby episode, but has plenty of new twists, turns, and crazy games.  Episode 287, Stinky Chips With Shane Torres, and Lauren Lapkus as Ms Chips. Shane is a new guest who fits in pretty well, but Lauren steals the show with her pervertedly prudish new character. Easily up there with Traci Reardon or Todd, if you ask me.  Episode 289, The Exorcism of Cake Boss With Paul F Tompkins as Cake Boss, and Matt Gourley as H. R. Gieger. This is an episode with a great storyline (well, as much as CBB can have storylines), that still manages to be as silly and spontaneous as any other episode.  Episode 300, Oh, Golly! You Devil! With Jason Mantzoukas, and Andy Daly as... well, everyone. This is the closest CBB comes to being epic, in the true sense of the word. This episode is very complex, and you'll definitely need to have heard Episode 274 first, but Andy Daly's performance is incredibly impressive, and, more importantly, hilarious. If you liked the previous Mantzoukas-Daly episodes, or Andy Daly's Podcast Pilot Project, this should be right up your alley.  Episode 304, Marissa Wompler's Six Flags Birthday Womptacular With Jessica St Clair as Marissa Wompler, and Lennon Parham, Lauren Lapkus, Jason Mantzoukas, Brian Huskey, Melissa Rauch, Andy Daly and Scott Aukerman as way too many other characters. This is the point where the Wompler storyline vanished completely up its own ass, and I loved it. If you liked the last Womptacular, you'll like this one too. You might want to check out the other Wompler episodes first (every episode with St Clair is a part of the Wompler story) but honestly, I don't think it'll help.  Episode 306, Project Funway With Harris Wittels, Paul Rust, and Michael Cassady. I love this episode so much, I might as well be Paul Rust over here. After a string of story-heavy episodes, this one is just three goofballs having a ton of fun. The silliness is off the charts. Also features some new songs from Don't Stop Or We'll Die.  I also loved the most recent four episodes, but maybe my judgement is clouded by having just heard them. Episode 309 and 310 both have great characters (Nick Kroll as an Australian celebrity, and John Gemberling as Scott's new sex robot), and Episode 311 and 312 both have guests who have great chemistry with Scott (Joe Lo Truglio, and Andy Samberg).  EDIT 2:  Haha holy shit I just noticed how the description grows exponentially longer. I told you I was looking forward to writing this."
comedybangbang,2hbqob,ksaid1,7,Wed Sep 24 13:30:25 2014 UTC,The exorcism of cake boss is so fucking good. The amount of research Matt Gourley made to become the character of HR Geiger is ridiculous.

The Tenacious D interview is entertaining enough, but things really pick up when Regina Crimp (Lauren Lapkus) and Russ (Joe Wengert) show up. To me, Wengert is the MVP. He always sounds like he's on the verge of tears and is fantastic throughout.   Another good one is #277: Comedy Bang Me. Chelsea Peretti and the Bachelor Brothers.  290: Shed Busting. Todd Glass gives a pretty lengthy interview (accompanied by James Adomian) about his experience with coming out. It's surprisingly serious for a CBB episode but very interesting.

When he was on with Jon Daly doing the Peppermen bit, it was so jarring how Jon had so much energy and was making all kinds of crazy offers, and Zach was just like, ""Yeah. Uh-huh. Sing the song again.""  There are episodes with guests that I find obnoxious or annoying. I'm okay with that though, because I know that there are other people who will really enjoy it. But when a guest just sits there contributing nothing, that really bugs me."

The show follows the Hot Talk format, which brought Leykis much success,  particularly in the Southern California radio market.  Due to the provocative nature of the show, Leykis has often been described as a shock jock.      The show's best-known feature is ""Leykis 101"", in which he purports to teach men ""how to get laid"" while spending the least amount of time, money, and effort.

comedybangbang,2d7qvs,crudmeal,10,Mon Aug 11 07:10:20 2014 UTC,The rare character played by Scott really added to the episode. Wompler adds such an awesome dynamic to the episodes she shows up on - these are always hilarious.

Then Wompler dejected will turn to Don Demillo Theatrical Director and go to one of his camps. Lord knows if Scott wasn't wanting that sweet pyramid ass then Don surely would find.... uses for it. Enter Miss Listler and her sniper tracking skills who rescues her before any of the bestiality starts and she ends up killing Cactus Tony (again) or someone like that.   It'll be like Game of Thrones meets comedy bang bang."

comedybangbang,2bxc8b,Misguided_Editor,2,Tue Jul 29 00:12:43 2014 UTC,You could hear everyone in the studio struggling to keep it together when the dentist came in (and I believe it was Jonah who couldn't stop laughing). I had to pause it I was laughing so hard.

Tiny and Victor are two of the ""realest"" characters in the pantheon of imaginary people that populate this world and the performance is flawless. There wasn't a moment where the improv went ""random for random's sake"" but it was never not funny (sorry, JP). Also I think we all witnessed a bit of history as the closing the plug bag song got just a little bit better. Huge episode. Other than the ep 300 epic this is my favorite in a long time."

comedybangbang,29ku7p,Toorvanda,4,Tue Jul 1 17:30:04 2014 UTC,"I had completely agreed with you when the episodes originally aired, but after re-watching them on Netflix, I think it's just as good. I'm not sure why. I would recommend giving the birthday boys a shot. All of the episodes are streaming on Netflix."
comedybangbang,29ku7p,KungFooRobot,2,Tue Jul 1 18:21:14 2014 UTC,"This happened to me too.  And most of my friends actually. We would watch the episodes live together and say ""eh it was okay, not bad but not good either"". But then weeks later we would reference a certain bit or sketch from that episode and laugh like idiots.  I wondered why that was, went back and rewatched the episode, and enjoyed it immensely more. That being said, I think season 3 is following more along the lines of season 1 than 2."
comedybangbang,29ku7p,RussIsAnOkayGuy,2,Wed Jul 2 14:49:35 2014 UTC,"I feel like there were WAY more bits and absurdity based around sketches/scenarios.  i don't put one above the other, but it definitely had a minor format change in that sense.  I'm liking this season so far, and am really interested to see how they're gonna pull of 40 episodes in season 4."
comedybangbang,29ku7p,pinkelephants512,3,Wed Jul 2 04:24:23 2014 UTC,"I agree - there were too many bits that went on way too long in season 2.  The show is funniest when it's at it's most scattered and absurd, not when they start doing episode-long gimmicks.  In particular I thought the second half of the season was even worse than the first half.  Also, I'm going to just say it - I don't think Horatio Sans is very funny, and not very good at improv.  I don't think I've ever enjoyed any of his appearances on the show or podcast."

comedybangbang,26whdz,ksaid1,2,Sat May 31 00:42:45 2014 UTC,"I love when Scott sings. I saw a clip on tumblr from a Ben Schwartz appearance (I think Werner was there too) where Ben tried to get Scott to join in singing Skid Row from Little Shop of Horrors. It started like this:   BEN: I wanna try something. I'm gonna sing a song, see if you can guess it.    SCOTT: Okay.    BEN: Poor--    SCOTT: --All my life I've always been poor! I keep asking God what I'm for. And he tells me...   EDIT: Found the clip! That's some classic Schwartz right there."

Now let's play a clapping game! Now let's do a freeze-frame high five!""  ""Hey Jake, what if I sucked your dick in this scene?"""

comedybangbang,263o91,bigontheinside,3,Wed May 21 20:45:54 2014 UTC,Definitely need to start from the beginning. The latter episodes get so callback dense (in a fantastic way) that it's impossible to start with the latest episode.   Also I've never heard a single U2 song except maybe Vertigo via South Park (hello hello)
comedybangbang,263o91,WeeBabySeamus,2,Thu May 22 04:10:31 2014 UTC,"I hate U2 but it's still pretty funny to me. They talk a lot of U2 to me though on this particular one, and Billy Joel"

comedybangbang,25l24n,megatom0,1 point,Thu May 22 04:00:53 2014 UTC,Yeah something about Scott and Mar'ron on that podcast was making me uncomfortable.
comedybangbang,25l24n,Broncotruck,4,Thu May 29 04:33:23 2014 UTC,"Wait, wait, wait. Maron? I thought the show was called Marin, based on the life of comedian Cheech Marin!"

comedybangbang,25l24n,Condawg,4,Fri May 16 04:30:49 2014 UTC,"This is what he said in an interview like 2 weeks ago:   Marc actually has a goofy sense of humor, but he doesn’t do that in his own act. His own act is more a personal examination of his own psychosis and born out of a desire to inform the audience about how many 20-year-olds are inclined to sleep with him. In his mind there is a difference between the wacky people and the real comics. I don’t see the distinction all that much.   http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/scott-aukerman-goes-off-script.html?referrer="
comedybangbang,25l24n,SaltyChristian,8,Sun Jun 1 02:36:35 2014 UTC,"He took a pretty harsh dig at Maron on Never Not Funny last week. They are probably perfectly fine with each other, but comedically they're kind of at odds, while experiencing similar career trajectories. The subtle Maron bashing is one of my favorite parts of CBB these days."
comedybangbang,25l24n,littleavalanche,1 point,Thu May 15 01:43:43 2014 UTC,What did he say? I tried listening to that ep and couldn't get through it.  Not a big Pardo fan when he is a host.
comedybangbang,25l24n,overunderdog,10,Thu May 15 22:15:59 2014 UTC,"Yeah I suffered through the Pardo because I am a Scott super fan. Scott said something like ""Tune in to see which hot 20-year-old will be trying to sleep with Marc Maron this week"""
comedybangbang,25l24n,littleavalanche,4,Thu May 15 22:26:42 2014 UTC,"""Tune in to see which hot 20-year-old will be trying to sleep with Marc Maron this week""   This. I tried to watch the show with only having heard a few WTFs I found mildly interesting. The show is just as pretentious as his podcast, and even more ego driven.  The thing I like about Scott is he doesn't seem like he is ever too good for anyone. Maron on the otherhand is just insufferable in this way."

I just remember him talking about having to ""fart some beans"" the way he said it just grates on me to this day. So yeah, I get why Scott laughs when he says it.

comedybangbang,24b9m3,Bazpingo,4,Tue Apr 29 21:34:31 2014 UTC,"If you haven't figured it out by now, the basic structure for most of the episodes is starting with a short interview with an actor/comedian and then a character will show up to disrupt the proceedings for the rest of the show. If you're looking for an in depth interview with your favorite celebrity, this might not be the place.  The episode that helped me really ""get"" Comedy Bang! Bang! was Out of Bleeps. I downloaded it because I like Amy Poehler and Jason Mantzoukas. At the time I had never heard of James Adomian (or for that matter, Tom Leykis, the impression he does), but he absolutely steals the show.   One good intro point could be the 2010 Holiday episode. It features quite a few popular characters (Cake Boss, El Chupacabra, Don Dimelo, Bob Ducca) and is absolutely hilarious.  Or you could listen to the best of episodes. As described, they feature the best bits (as voted on by listeners) of that year's episodes. Find out which characters/comedians you enjoy and look for more appearances.  I hope that this helps. There are a lot of great episodes to discover. Enjoy!  edit: and if you care, here is an interview in which Scott Aukerman picks out and discusses three of his favorite episodes: http://www.avclub.com/article/scott-aukerman-picks-his-favorite-icomedy-bang-ban-89838"

Once I'd done that I went through in order listening to those I hadn't heard yet.   Also check out 'U Talkin' U2 to me' for mor Adam Scott and 'Analyse Phish' for more Whittles"
comedybangbang,24b9m3,TheMauveAvenger,2,Wed Apr 30 05:36:27 2014 UTC,"If you're into the more absurd side of the characters on comedy bang bang and sometimes vulgar comedy then check out improv 4 humans with Matt Besser. It's usually 4 or 5 comedians each show. They take a few one word suggestions from Twitter and then talk about real life stories that those words remind them of, followed by a round of improv based off that story.

I'd say his best characters in the CBB universe are Jesse Ventura, Tom Leykis, and the Sheriff of Nottingham. As you probably know, he takes real life things and blows them up to absurdity.   http://comedybangbang.wikia.com/wiki/James_Adomian  I have to say though the best episode with him IMO is #98 ""a worthy uhh"".   http://www.earwolf.com/episode/a-worthy-uhhh/  I also personally feel that CBB hit it's stride after around #50.   Other comedians that have incredible fan favorite characters are Paul F Tompkins and Andy Daly. PFT develops his celebrity characters around their weirdest traits in a really funny way. Andy Daly creates characters on the fly and uses his incredible improv skills to  make distinctly intense individuals.   http://comedybangbang.wikia.com/wiki/Andy_Daly  http://comedybangbang.wikia.com/wiki/Paul_F._Tompkins"

Only talk shows, game shows, and other unscripted/lightly scripted programming can sustain a nightly schedule.

Club's comments (http://www.avclub.com/article/andy-daly-takes-over-and-comedy-bang-bang-goes-nut-201880#comment-1278881036):    Also, at one point Scott chuckles over a text he receives during the show but declines to read it on the podcast. He shared it with the audience during the break and I feel it's my duty to report it to the AV Club. It was from Kulap (his wiiiife!) and it read: ""At the spa and I just saw Alison Brie's bare breasts. Put that in your spank bank!"""

comedybangbang,209cje,DELINQ,4,Wed Mar 12 21:55:21 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure whether or not you're referencing it, but just in case, Adomian has also played ""Alan Rickman"" on the show (who himself was playing the Sheriff of Nottingham I think). http://www.earwolf.com/episode/a-worthy-uhhh/. This episode is also pretty hilarious."
comedybangbang,209cje,weaglebeagle,2,Thu Mar 13 03:11:11 2014 UTC,"I just realized they never made reference to Alan Rickman. I wonder if this is an entirely different character or if ""Rickman"" has simply gone insane and his duties as Sheriff have taken precedence in his life.  CBB canon is becoming increasingly, worryingly important to me.  Also, JA's Gary Larceny quip was perfection."
comedybangbang,209cje,DELINQ,3,Thu Mar 13 05:52:39 2014 UTC,"Someone found this on the earwolf forums but after the episode where they did Sheriff of Nottingham and Alan Rickman, Scott did a blog post about it. Apparently they received some complaints, and one of things that he mentioned about the episode was that Alan Rickman wasn't initially supposed to be part of the character and Scott just put that on James without notice.   I will never understand why anyone wouldn't like that episode, it's one of my all time favorites.   Here is a link to the article which is good reading for any CBB fan.  https://web.archive.org/web/20110703081101/http://www.earwolf.com/2011/06/how-the-bread-is-made-episode-98/"
comedybangbang,209cje,wootootee,3,Thu Mar 13 16:32:19 2014 UTC,I didn't know this before but that was a good read. Nice find! It explains why Adomian talks (in this new episode) about the CBB gold being a bit that didn't quite work.  And I can't believe they got so many complaints. I was cracking up during the episode.

Another Earwolf podcast worth listening to is Professor Blastoff with Tig Notaro, Kyle Dunnigan, and David Huntsberger.  REALLY funny and also incredibly touching at times.  Enjoy watching Community?  Then FUCKING LISTEN TO HARMONTOWN.  I really enjoy the Dana Gould Hour, although the episodes and format are infrequent and inconsistent.  Mike and Tom Eat Snacks is no longer around, but worth listening to the back catalog.  Enjoying the Andy Daly Podcast Pilot Project? Then go check out SuperEgo... Again, I don't think they are making new ones, but there are some amazing hours of entertainment there. (EDIT: Because it features Matt Gourley, the other gent on that show)  And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fine podcasts produced by the Maximum Fun Network (Jordan Jesse Go, Stop Podcasting Yourself, My Brother My Brother and Me, and Throwing Shade)...

However, it is somewhat movie focused and isn't as absurdist as comedy bang! bang! Professor Blastoff is great like many people have mentioned.  Put Your Hands Together is a great podcast also. If you like standup comedy and high energy lesbians, it's definitely for you.  Sklarbro County and Country are great. If you subscribe to one, you get the other. County isn't sports focused, but really, as long as you have an periphery view of sports, you'll enjoy both. They have awesome voice characters. You'll often see Jesse Ventura along with other James Adomian features on this show.   and FINALLY The Dead Authors Podcast is great. You learn a lot and also get the absurd character acting that you get in CBB and the Pod F Tompkast. It's hosted by PFT as H.G. Wells. Every single episode is great. The closer you listen, the funnier it is.   Good luck my fellow podcast listener."
comedybangbang,1zmy5n,Denadamedacro,3,Thu Mar 6 02:20:07 2014 UTC,I second the Dead Authors Podcast.   The episodes with Andy Daly as the Marquis De Sade (basically French Don DiMelo) and John Hodgman as Ayd Rand are some of the most wonderful things I've heard.

It's Andy Daly doing the characters that originated on CBB. And he has great guests that also do characters like Paul F Tompkins, Matt Besser, Betsy Sodaro and others.  Doug Loves Movies is great. If you like Dungeons and Dragons then Nerd Poker is a good one. Improv 4 Humans is also great  I'm not sure if it's still going but The Dead Authors Podcast is really good too. It's hosted by PFT who plays a time travelling H.G. Wells who travels back in time to bring a dead author to our time to interview them. The dead authors are played by people such as Scott Auckerman, Paul Scheer, Nick Kroll, Kristen Schaal, and more."

(since i was late to this great thread, these are a few of my recommendations):  as stated by many others how did this get made is utterly fantastic. many of the episodes don't require having seen the film. i also love who charted (co-hosted by the choctaw's former-fiance-turned-wife kulap) it has a really fun energy if that makes any sense and kremer always cracks me up. another vote too for the dead author's podcast. PFT is one of my favorite people alive and his HG wells reminds me a lot of when he is out of character just being witty and amazing. a lot of the guests allow him to just chime in with hilarious questions or contradictions since they provide so much energy (check out the episode with scott as ben franklin or mantzoukas as plato). plus it raises money for a non-profit which means paul records an NPR-like intro/outro that makes me smile every damn time."

On an slightly related note, I am always going to be upset about Huell's last appearance on CBB. I think Jeff Garlin completely killed that episode.

comedybangbang,1u3g9r,Fishmandog,2,Sat Jan 11 05:28:04 2014 UTC,I think Jeff Garlin completely killed that episode.   He steamrolled that episode it was horrible.  I remember feeling the exact same way

If you hear a joke that seems inside, maybe take note and go back to an earlier episode with the person who is making the joke.   I will add another suggestion: listen to episodes with Paul F.

Harris Wittles is one of my favorites as well. And you cant go wrong with Seth Morris either. There really is no wrong way to listen to the CBB Podcast and if you listen to enough episodes you will pick up on all the inside jokes. Enjoy you've just struck a comedy goldmine!"

The early stuff doesn't have the same flow as the new stuff as Scott has really grow into the host roll.   I started listening picking out people I knew, and then I would discover a new person I liked and go back through and listen to all their episodes. Later on I started going through in order and listened to all the ones I hadn't heard yet.   One sub-set of episodes that you do need to follow the storyline to get the most out of are those with Jessica St. Clair. The back stories that they create run through many episodes and the charecters in them are brilliant.  Looking back at my saved podcasts they're numbers 60, 92, 116, 154, 156, 167, 178, 188, 218, 220, 238. 11 episodes or Marissa Wompler  Another sub-set that comes to mind are the Farts and Procreation episodes. 120, 166, 219  They're probably about 1 hour 15m on average so there's actually been 13.5 days worth on content on the podcast. So good luck in getting through them.  There was a seemingly insurmountable number of podcasts when I started listening but I managed to catch up eventually.  I'd like to here an update in a few months to see how you're going - I wish I got to listen to them all over again.   Good Luck"

Rainn can barely keep it together after that first story."

""A curse on your lack of a house!"" is one of my favorite PFT lines.  That being said, I was a little uncertain about this segment. These guys are best at long-form improv, and long-form improv derives its comedy from deep backstories. Fourvel especially is not an immediately funny character. In this case, with only a few minutes to to bring the viewers up to speed, everything felt forced. Additionally, they didn't really develop any new points. It felt like a 5-minute summary of a 90-minute episode.  I guess I wish they could treat the TV show as the podcast and have the backstories known, but I understand why they can't do that.  I do like that they brought in a character who doesn't look like his actor. It leaves hope that the Marissa ""GoAT"" Wompler might make an appearance in some capacity."

comedybangbang,1dhw81,GiantDeviantPiano,4,Sat May 11 16:24:05 2013 UTC,I miss the rap battles! It seemed like the guest hated it but they were all hilarious
comedybangbang,1dhw81,magdb,2,Mon May 13 12:20:29 2013 UTC,"Paul Rudd's rap pretty much encapsulates that feeling.  MOTORCYCLES AND BIPCYCLES, FUCCKKKKK THISS."

comedybangbang,1dhw81,Memphish_Boognish,0,Mon May 13 15:06:31 2013 UTC,I forgot his specifically but YouTube has the answer http://youtube.com/watch?v=vmPCMwc6mDU  I don't think he's been on since?  Ken Marinos that kicks in after typifies what I like about that segment though. He ends up trying to come up with a name rhyming with religion and getting stuck. But he also says Jewy Jew Jew which bust me up
comedybangbang,1dhw81,GiantDeviantPiano,1 point,Mon May 13 15:10:49 2013 UTC,"Oh holy shit that was Paul Rudd the whole time? I've been thinking it was Ken Marino for so long. Now I'm confused and I have no clue who rapped what haha.  Neither Paul or Ken have been on since but David was on the last one, which was so damn good."
comedybangbang,1dhw81,magdb,0,Mon May 13 15:59:19 2013 UTC,Paul just did the first line and the rest was Ken Marino I think. He was on the burning live episode most recently?
comedybangbang,1dhw81,GiantDeviantPiano,3,Mon May 13 22:14:39 2013 UTC,"No, it was all Paul, Marino barely did anything on that rap"
comedybangbang,1dhw81,Memphish_Boognish,1 point,Wed May 15 04:36:15 2013 UTC,you're correct. Scott goes to throw to Ken but then Paul steps back in. Their voices sounded similar to me.  I have downvoted my previous two posts out of dishonour
comedybangbang,1dhw81,GiantDeviantPiano,1 point,Wed May 15 07:49:47 2013 UTC,I think that was his only appearance on Comedy Bang Bang.
comedybangbang,1dhw81,magdb,2,Tue May 14 01:47:04 2013 UTC,Ken Marino has been on thrice now. That one with Rudd and the two eps with the burning love cast. If you haven't checked out Burning love its wel worth it

comedybangbang,1dc0hz,Anonittor,8,Mon Apr 29 12:19:57 2013 UTC,"It's Scott Aukerman's impression of the start of the Bare Naked Ladies song One Week: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC_q9KPczAg  I can't remember which episode it first appeared in, but he busts it out every so often."
comedybangbang,1dc0hz,tigertom,3,Mon Apr 29 13:35:42 2013 UTC,"Thank you, I finally have closure!  I was floored when 'Forville' broke it out for the first time in 215 while walking down the street.  I must've looked completely insane."

comedybangbang,1d441s,Fishmandog,6,Thu Apr 25 22:27:07 2013 UTC,This will be the best!  Everything Harris does cracks me up!
comedybangbang,1d441s,professorblastronaut,4,Fri Apr 26 05:01:18 2013 UTC,"I'm so glad he's been given some screen time in Parks and Rec.  My girlfriend hates it, but every time he pops up wearing that stupid Phish t-shirt, I have to pause it and tell her why he's so funny to me.  I do the same with Jason Mantzoukas."
comedybangbang,1d441s,AngusOReily,2,Fri Apr 26 15:12:25 2013 UTC,My favorite one of those was when his picture was in the sperm donor cork board for filling the cup up the most.
comedybangbang,1d441s,asianhunter,2,Sat Apr 27 07:23:10 2013 UTC,Oh yeah that was the best joke of the season. Every time Harris is on screen I go into the Harris's Phone/Foam corner theme.
