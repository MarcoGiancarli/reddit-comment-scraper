superleague,3e3ijs,paulusmagintie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:23 2015 UTC,"Great move not just for Sheffield but for RL in Britain in general I think if it works out. Ideally you want at least 6 pro sides in the Championship so you could get more than just 1 up 1 down at the end of the year. I think this could push a couple more (Featherstone should be one I think) to turn pro which makes it 6 (4 being Leigh, Bradford, Sheffield and London for next year)."

superleague,3dybpi,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,3,Mon Jul 20 22:27:11 2015 UTC,Can't see a Cas player winning it again. Cuthbertsons offloads are amazing to watch - the guy is like an octopus.
superleague,3dybpi,mattsbury,2,Tue Jul 21 07:45:41 2015 UTC,"Perhaps an overhaul of how MoS is awarded is needed.

Plus we replaced Brent Webb with Zak Hardaker in Smith's spot.  Think first game he came back he scored 2 and the 2nd was in the corner with no time left against Bradford I think!
superleague,3duac9,lewishaloboy,2,Sun Jul 19 15:20:27 2015 UTC,"It seems whenever anyone plays against Wakefield this season there's more away fans than home fans.

superleague,3duac9,CaptainMexicano,3,Sun Jul 19 17:30:24 2015 UTC,I think it'll definitely be a forward due to the fact nobody has stood out this year like previous years e.g. Daryl Clark.  Cuthbertson would probably be our player of the year so stands a good chance of Man Of Steel.  Slightly interesting fact. 3 Castleford players have won it since a Leeds player last won it.
superleague,3duac9,MLA92,2,Sun Jul 19 17:52:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I think you've got a point there. Didn't realise that about 3 Cas players winning since the last Leeds player (was it Harris?)
superleague,3duac9,MLA92,3,Mon Jul 20 08:35:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Harris in 98."
superleague,3duac9,CaptainMexicano,3,Mon Jul 20 10:18:07 2015 UTC,"Another slightly interesting Leeds fact. We have scored 29 more tries than Wigan who have scored 99, yet we don't have a player in the top 10 try scorers."
superleague,3duac9,MLA92,2,Mon Jul 20 10:53:17 2015 UTC,"Just shows you have more players able to score I suppose. It's all good having an absolute try machine but if you rely on them to win matches you'll be stuffed if they get injured. Denny got injured yesterday before he'd had a chance to score but Cas had plenty of other options to use. Also, if both Denny and Carney had been fit all season I'm sure at least one of them would be close to the top!"
superleague,3duac9,CaptainMexicano,2,Mon Jul 20 11:30:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its a bit bizarre really. Watkins/Hall/Handley on 12 are joint top. Then you've got random players dotted about. Ablett has 9, Singleton has 8 (for a prop!!) and Cuthbertson has 7.  Never seen anything like it at Leeds."

No highlight of a specific thing Koukash said prior to this match and no solution offered on how said thing should have been handled for better team morale.  He mentions London Broncos in the full quote, a team only in SL on token location value with completely shot at player confidence. He never publicly called for their removal when he was there and if anyone ever publicly highlighted any one of Londons many flaws he'd have jumped to their defence and told them to keep their noses out."

superleague,3dodra,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:51:14 2015 UTC,Don't think McDermott is that wrong in fairness to the bloke. The team Salford have on paper is so much better than their standing in the league but you can see in their attitude and possibly their culture that the team just isn't together.  It's a shame really. We need a strong team in Salford and essentially Manchester but the overhaul that Koukash has done has seemingly gone completely wrong.

superleague,3dhyqv,tyjams,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:32:37 2015 UTC,"Be stupid to do so, it's the fact we very rarely let them push in a scrum which makes it an issue.   A while back not sure who it was, pushed a St Helens scrum and forced Roby (Safest hands in the league!) to knock the ball on. They provide chances and space if used correctly so it would be stupid to get rid of them.  The NRL seems to use them pretty well by spreading the ball with their faster players, so it's a no from me! Keep the scrum  Also if we did get rid of them, what would we replace them with? A tap on the line? Line outs?"

superleague,3dhyqv,J1mjam2112,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:19:34 2015 UTC,"Don't think that gives them time to organise though, a scrum allows half backs to sort out their line etc"
superleague,3dhyqv,Rhyk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:22:42 2015 UTC,"It was Castleford.   To be honest the pushing is now a last ditch effort move now or used to get the ball back in the opposition territory.  St.Helens and by extension the England squad do actually try, it rarely works because the scrum breaks due to the other side not expecting it.   So with that I think we should keep it."
superleague,3dff1h,supercharv,3,Wed Jul 15 21:07:14 2015 UTC,"I always get confused when English media refer to soccer as football in rugby league articles.   England has a problem, you're surrounded by easily accessible opposition but none of them are currently able to compete. Then again, these countries aren't going to get better if they don't play quality opposition.   Imo after the World Cup England should join the European Championship A, with either the winner of Euro Championship B (now Serbia) promoted or the loser of EC A demoted to make it an even number of teams.   My ideal comp:  Euro Champ A:   England  Wales France Scotland    Euro Champ B   Ireland  Serbia  Russia  Italy   Euro Champ C   Ukraine  Spain Greece Malta   Promotion/relegation at the end so every team has the chance to move up."
superleague,3dff1h,orru,2,Wed Jul 15 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"To add to the problems, players flip countries like Cherry-Evans. Ireland for example would have a half decent squad. Off the top of my head we would have Grix at 1, Sneyd and Finn at 6/7 and McIllorum at 9.  We need players to commit to countries like Danny Brough. He might have done it for the wrong reasons, but he's almost always represented Scotland."
superleague,3dff1h,MLA92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:34:05 2015 UTC,Playing against quality opposition regularly would be a good way of getting those players to commit
superleague,3dff1h,orru,2,Wed Jul 15 23:06:39 2015 UTC,"But if Australia and NZ are not interested where do you think we get that quality opposition from?   Australia are too focused on themselves, NZ seems more open to playing internationals hence their tour this year."
superleague,3dff1h,paulusmagintie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:34:57 2015 UTC,"Sneyd was born in Manchester. Wouldn't that mean he would have to flip to play for Ireland?  But i get your point, any half decent players who have a chance to play for England however they are linked, usually do rather than Ireland/Scotland & Wales. Doesn't really happen in Union as all of those teams are really good, it would probably take us to ban it from happening for it to improve the teams. Then from there on, it could benefit all of the surrounding countries national sides? But we'd lose some pretty good players!  It doesn't help though when we have say Rangi Chase in our national team, the guy was born on the otherside of the world. How on earth he is eligible I don't know!"

Now we have nearly a pure England team that can take it to the Aussies and NZ, hell we was 1 bad (debated) call from beating Australia last time and we are always a match for New Zealand, if anything NZ v England games lately have been nothing but edge of seat, 110% effort given brutal games and we lose by a try or a couple of points in the last few minutes.   We are more than a match now."
superleague,3dff1h,paulusmagintie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:33:30 2015 UTC,"Benefits us aye, definitely...  But the likes of Ireland/Scotland and Wales? The countries that current sides are lacking talent, not as much as it's them quirks that allows us to take their talented players.

superleague,3dff1h,paulusmagintie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:24:45 2015 UTC,"It's naff if you want the sport to be much more competitive overall. For example if young Welsh lads saw their league side playing really well against the likes of England they would probably take more interest in to the sport and want to be apart of it. Sadly not many people like a one sided match, especially when your team are the shit ones haha - trust me... I'm a Salford fan!"

We abandoned our England Knights team because of it, they don't want to lose every year they want a chance to win for 2-3 years then use England's main team as a benchmark to see if they have improved at all.  We are just too powerful of a team to put against these guys."
superleague,3dff1h,paulusmagintie,2,Thu Jul 16 08:28:09 2015 UTC,"Can I just say in regards to the England Knights I think it was abandon because European teams flat out said ""We don't want another England team in our competitions who win everything it's useless, if we play against England we want the Sovereign team every few years instead"".  So basically with nobody for the England Knights to play and Europe's preference to get the holy shit kicked out of them by the main England squad every 3-4 years they just got rid of it."

superleague,3d6zmg,orru,3,Tue Jul 14 00:36:05 2015 UTC,We actually did this about 10/15 years ago. I think it was decided it wasn't financially viable. A lot of clubs simply can't afford to have a home game taken away from them.
superleague,3d6zmg,MLA92,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:12:56 2015 UTC,"To be fair the World Cup was also a disaster 10/15 years ago, I think Super League is in a good position to give it a shot again.  The World Cup and Magic Weekends are working, so why not give it another go?"
superleague,3d6zmg,paulusmagintie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:07:55 2015 UTC,I think Wigan are actually trialing it I suppose!  Wouldn't mind seeing a rhinos game in a random place I guess!
superleague,3d6zmg,MLA92,2,Tue Jul 14 13:20:59 2015 UTC,I think 1 game not in a traditional area per team is a pretty good idea I think.

superleague,3d6zmg,paulusmagintie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:23:23 2015 UTC,I put forward a suggestion of having the round of 16 instead of the magic weekend.  All knockout games and I think you'd get a higher attendance. 4 games per day.
superleague,3d6zmg,MLA92,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:31:36 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of games for a couple of teams to play in a week, if anything Fatigue will kick in and the quality of the games will suffer.   We see this at Easter so having multiple games in 1 week isn't going to be great, it could do the opposite...unless I understand you wrong."
superleague,3d6zmg,paulusmagintie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you do. Instead of having the magic weekend (drop the extra league game entirely), swap it with a cup round at a stadium.  Move the round of 16 from weekend of 16/17th may to magic which is 30/31 as an example of this season. Also means it frees up a weekend to either put an international game in or take the extra Easter game and put it there."
superleague,3d6zmg,MLA92,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:45:20 2015 UTC,"Oh you mean do 1 Challenge Cup round on 1 day, not a knock out tournament in 1 week, got you."
superleague,3d6zmg,paulusmagintie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:47:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah haha. Essentially it would be 4 games on the Saturday and 4 games on the Sunday. Times would obviously be an issue though so you could play 1 Friday night, 4 Saturday and 3 on Sunday."

superleague,3d6zmg,Doggies_of_War,3,Tue Jul 14 11:34:58 2015 UTC,I don't think so. Most of the big teams have a financial backer (saints and Warrington for examples) or have got themselves in a position where they don't need it (Leeds).  I'd love to see one to see what impact it had though. But it'd only realistically work with a team like Hull FC for example. Strong fan base and should really be getting more fans.
superleague,3d6zmg,MLA92,3,Tue Jul 14 17:21:12 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with Wigan taking a Super 8s game to London.  Regular season, yes. But not one of the last seven games of the season.  They are also putting themselves at a disadvantage because finishing in the top four gives them a valuable fourth home game."
superleague,3d6zmg,teasizzle,3,Tue Jul 14 15:38:13 2015 UTC,Couldn't have said this better. Consider their home record compared to their away record too and it suddenly seems a horrible idea.
superleague,3d6zmg,MLA92,2,Tue Jul 14 15:57:41 2015 UTC,I suppose this is a good place to ask:  Is Toulouse ever coming into the comp? I lived with a French bloke and got him to support Canterbury and promised him I'd go for his hometown team if they ever got into Super League.
superleague,3d6zmg,Doggies_of_War,3,Tue Jul 14 09:21:53 2015 UTC,"Is Toulouse ever coming into the comp?

Generally bottom four face top hour, the better you do in regular season the more favorable the fixtures ie being at home etc. I'm not sure on the specifics of who is promoted and relegated, but there is some form of playoffs now I think in the middle eights for the 'million pound game' or something"

superleague,3cyo9v,supercharv,3,Sun Jul 12 09:54:52 2015 UTC,I see. I am Colombian and idk why saints specifically. I think it was mostly because of Kyle Amor and his Afro that reminded me of Bob Ross. And I like their badge.
superleague,3cyo9v,supercharv,2,Sun Jul 12 13:03:09 2015 UTC,"I am Colombian    Cool, has the sport even reached there yet or did you just see a video one day on the net? Either way, welcome mate!"
superleague,3cyo9v,supercharv,3,Sun Jul 12 13:06:30 2015 UTC,"Also the main reason I got interested was because of invictus (the movie about the South African rugby team winning the rugby World Cup) and when soccer isn't shown on fox soccer, super league rugby and nrl games are shown instead."
superleague,3cyo9v,paulusmagintie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:12:53 2015 UTC,Haha thanks :D Well the dominant sport here is soccer or football as it is known nearly elsewhere. We have our rugby leagues in the country and it is becoming more and more popular. We have our national team as well. And I got interested in rugby for many reasons. It is now my favorite sport along with soccer.
superleague,3cyo9v,paulusmagintie,2,Sun Jul 12 13:10:14 2015 UTC,We have our rugby leagues in the country    As in Rugby League leagues...or Rugby Union Leagues?   Its good that fox is showing some NRL and superleague though whilst the footy isn't on :)
superleague,3cyo9v,paulusmagintie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:20:00 2015 UTC,I think league leagues lol like multiple rugby league leagues. Since I'm very new to the sport as a whole. Is being a saints fan known as a 'glory hunter' ? I don't want people to think I support them just because they have a lot of titles.

I wouldn't say so no, I mean you're from the other side of the earth so it isn't as if you have any local ties to any of the clubs!   I would call you a glory supporter if you changed who you supported each year based on who won ;)  If they are rugby league competitions that is fantastic!

superleague,3cwl3y,supercharv,2,Sat Jul 11 11:50:23 2015 UTC,"I used to really like Koukash - he seemed like a welcome breath of fresh air when he came in in 2013. He's starting to look like a little bit of a joke though, insomuch that he hasn't delivered anywhere near what he'd pledged with the club - which can't fill out its stadium even when they're not charging on the gate, and has been mired in controversy recently with regards to financial issues. It's starting to feel like more and more of the same arrogant rhetoric without any real results. I really hope Salford do well but I think Koukash needs to wind his neck in a bit and come up with a workable long term plan to build as a club. Hopefully Sheens can talk some sense into him.   His heart's in the right place, but I'm a bit worried about his brain."
superleague,3cwl3y,Rhyk,3,Sat Jul 11 20:23:03 2015 UTC,"It's a funny one mate, we gave away 5000 tickets against Catalans. Meaning if we was actually playing Saints or Wigan the overall attendance would of added an extra 5000 away fans meaning there would of been 10,000 in total, which is really good.  But we was playing a team from over-seas so that didn't happen. Don't judge them on that.  The club was left in absolute tatters after Wilkinson left the club, it was in debt, the team was terrible, the ground was going and signed a new shit deal, we was on the brink of dissolving and we barely had a club.  To be fair Koukash has turned it around and has brought great players in, sadly not all performed but the intent is there. He will get it right soon with Sheens around him.  My mate who works for Salford says the players aren't too happy with how they are treated, Koukash seems to expect instant success... It wont happen and I'm sure Sheens will clear that up. Hopefully.  This is a class club, get the stadium back in the heart of Salford, with a half decent side and no input from owners and fuck the RFL off from giving us ridiculous bans and you'd see a great side.  These bills are popping up from the Wilkinson era, failing to pay players and companies. It's a pain in the arse but this is the man who will put it right.  Sorry to Neil Diamond but money doesn't talk. A balanced team with the a good few players does.  Sorry to rant pal, hopefully we can improve but I can only see Koukash being the breath of fresh air to the RFL. We end up biting the bullet for the positive outbursts he does, some right some wrong. With massive bans. But that's another story! Try and make sense of this comment, it's all over the show and im drunk..."

superleague,3cstt4,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:12:17 2015 UTC,"Really wish we'd had this sort of player years ago, say in 2009. We'd have had the grunt of a younger Leuluai and Peacock with the offload and passing game of Lauitiiti and Cuthbertson. The cherry on top would be being guided around the park by Danny Buderus!  He must be in with a shot of winning man of steel?"
superleague,3cstt4,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,2,Sat Jul 11 12:23:59 2015 UTC,Jesus i forgot about Buderus haha! I think he should win it really... But you never know!
superleague,3cstt4,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:50:38 2015 UTC,Leeds fans have sort of accepted that none of our players will win the Man of Steel. Last time we had a player win it was Iestyn Harris in 1998!
superleague,3crzzm,supercharv,2,Fri Jul 10 08:20:52 2015 UTC,"The results from the recent Super League AGM, coupled with the results from the RFL’s 2014 trading year, saw around £32m invested in the game last year, an increase of 24 per cent on 2013   Can only be good news for all?"
superleague,3crzzm,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:21:16 2015 UTC,"Depends how it was spent really.. At ground level that's great. I have not seen them spend any money on any local League club i have been at from the age of 11... Now i play Union and have seen the RFU pump loads in to my club. We had the twickenham head ground manager down at our ground, new kits and all training gear supplied.   Big difference.."
superleague,3crzzm,DrHydeous,2,Fri Jul 10 10:02:19 2015 UTC,"The RFU makes several times as much money as the RFL does though, and the professional Union sides are, on average, in a better financial position than professional League sides are - just compare attendances between the Super League and Aviva Premiership. So the RFU makes more money and has to put comparatively less of it back into the top teams. It's no wonder that they can do more for local clubs.  Mind you, you were very lucky to get that much from the RFU."
superleague,3crzzm,Li0nhead,3,Fri Jul 10 10:54:05 2015 UTC,"It's not the club game that makes RU better off, it is it's massive international structure and the rich people involved that will attract rich sponsors. We get beer brands, they get international banks."

superleague,3crzzm,DrHydeous,2,Fri Jul 10 16:24:01 2015 UTC,"I can see how you might misunderstand that. Feel free to replace the ""So"" with a paragraph break."
superleague,3crzzm,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:49:35 2015 UTC,One of the first  Rugby Union sides developed and the first to have lighting on their pitch.. Most probably why

superleague,3cr17i,orru,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:11:50 2015 UTC,Can't they use any Super Leagues players as it's during the season?
superleague,3cr17i,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,3,Fri Jul 10 07:37:58 2015 UTC,"It is strange, we'll end up with essentially two Ireland squads, b one consisting of actual Irish players during the Super League / Championship season, and one consisting of players with Irish names and Yorkshire accents when the domestic seasons are over. I think they should try to nurture the home grown squad."
superleague,3cr17i,carl84,2,Fri Jul 10 07:43:46 2015 UTC,I think they should try to nurture the home grown squad.   I thought that was the whole point of this game? They are billing it as a development squad are they not?
superleague,3cr17i,supercharv,3,Fri Jul 10 07:55:05 2015 UTC,"Well let's hope they aren't all dropped for the games when the ""Irish"" SL/C players are available"
superleague,3cr17i,carl84,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:59:26 2015 UTC,RLWC Qualifiers are next year. Hopefully they stick with an Irish sqad.
superleague,3cr17i,supercharv,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:12:10 2015 UTC,Didn't the USA do similar? Qualify for the WC with home players and then drop them for ozzies come that actual world cup?
superleague,3cr17i,paulusmagintie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:17:03 2015 UTC,"How many times has a Championship team got into Super League then instantly dismantle the team?  It's a real shame when they do it, it's like saying ""thanks guys, c ya"""
superleague,3cr17i,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:25:06 2015 UTC,"I generally support Ireland over England due to the family and a random decision to not support England when I was about 10.  That said, I'd prefer Ireland to play the best possible team. Although that may hinder development somewhat, I don't want to see us get to a world cup and get smashed (see 2013 world cup)."
superleague,3cr17i,paulusmagintie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:49:25 2015 UTC,I always feel that National squads like Ireland should not use players from other competitions like Super League or the NRL because you end up with a player who is good with a team he doesn't know how to play with and the others depend heavily on them.   A team with no super stars can still play better than a team with 1 or 2 because they know each other and play well together (Like Leigh Centurions)
superleague,3codyj,supercharv,2,Thu Jul 9 14:01:41 2015 UTC,"Saw an interview on the SuperLeague facebook page, answers the questions perfectly... Very happy to have him at the club. Doesn't matter for how long, longer the better"
superleague,3cp3lr,supercharv,5,Thu Jul 9 17:13:16 2015 UTC,Absolute bollocks if he gets picked. We have loads of young good props (Walmsley/Cooper/Burgess'/Hill). To pick an old aussie that isnt good enough for the Aus team would really be a sad state of affairs. I hated Chase playing the other year aswell. PICK OUR YOUNG ENGLISH PLAYERS FOR ENGLAND NOT AUSSIES!!!!!
superleague,3cp3lr,tylerderhden,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:48:30 2015 UTC,"Do tend to agree with you on this one, although I wouldn't mind seeing Justin Carney play for England just once. Think he would offer up something a bit different..."
superleague,3cp3lr,CaptainMexicano,2,Fri Jul 10 10:03:44 2015 UTC,"Why tho? We have Hall, Makinson, Burgess, Manfredi, Charnley. Why should an Aussie who can't play for the green and golds play for England?"
superleague,3cp3lr,tylerderhden,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:55:11 2015 UTC,"He tends to draw at least an extra defender to himself, sometimes 2, creating more space in other areas of the field. Also in 1on1 situations I would back him 9 times of 10 to just barge past the opposing winger (He put Charnley on his arse about 3times last time they played at the Jungle).  I wouldn't want him in regularly in place of an English lad, but as I said would be great to see what happens just once or twice. *Unless he's taking Charnley's spot, personally don't rate him (or really like him) much at all."
superleague,3cp3lr,CaptainMexicano,3,Fri Jul 10 11:12:40 2015 UTC,"I think it should be an all English squad, I feel like the Burgess boys are a little overrated maybe its just me but they don't do anything particularly special on the field.  The most tries and breaks come from the British born players, the ones who have the ability to strike in their own half and create space through passing and footwork compared to the Aussies who just roll along, get close to the line and then strike.   The New Zealanders and Aussies cannot do what the English do and they struggle to defend against it when England are on a roll. (They force penalties to slow the game down and get their defense sorted).  Though I would say NZ are a nice blend of Aussie defense and English expansionist play."
superleague,3cp3lr,paulusmagintie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:22:02 2015 UTC,"The New Zealanders and Aussies cannot do what the English do? What? What does that even mean, course they can."
superleague,3cp3lr,tylerderhden,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:35:34 2015 UTC,I don't think they tend to play as fast or free flowing generally. They're capable but I think its a different mentality in the style of play and sometimes it catches them out
superleague,3cp3lr,tylerderhden,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:46:23 2015 UTC,NRL is unbelievably fast. Origin is the most fast paced game i've ever seen.
superleague,3cp3lr,tylerderhden,2,Fri Jul 10 18:02:41 2015 UTC,I don't rate charnley either haha but I'd prefer him over an Aussie.
superleague,3cp3lr,Mirrorkisser,2,Fri Jul 10 11:43:59 2015 UTC,Not good enough to replace any of the current forwards for me

superleague,3cp3lr,Mr_Mogli,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:51:28 2015 UTC,He could add something a bit different though with his offloading? Causes alot of teams problems!  Saying that I don't really watch the NRL so haven't seen the above players that much

superleague,3ckmsw,will_leeds,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:14:22 2015 UTC,Still not quite sure why he went for it.  Wigan fans probably had this reaction at the time...
superleague,3ckmsw,MLA92,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:12:28 2015 UTC,"I was there, and the reaction was more like:  Crap play..look, we're going nowhere, Oh richards is shaping up for one of his cross field bombs he does when the play breaks...Wait, the ball hit the floor, and the kick is deep, what as waste....Wait...Wait....Whaaaaaat!? That's the most amazing thing ive ever seen.   It went from depair to, confusion, to amazement in 2 seconds.  He took all the drop outs and regularly hit over 50m.  Crazy."

superleague,3ckmsw,MLA92,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:19:17 2015 UTC,How so?
superleague,3ckmsw,tylerderhden,3,Wed Jul 8 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"He's a 34 year old winger who is taking up a quota spot, I think?  I don't really think Catalans need a winger like Richards either. I presume with this signing Oldfield will be leaving, but have a bit of faith in Faoud Yaha. The kid's come on in his first season and played pretty well. You could have him on one wing and Duport on the other and start prioritising French players."
superleague,3ckmsw,MLA92,2,Wed Jul 8 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm, true but he's definitely a good player to have in your team. Guaranteed trys and kicks, that will win you games alone. Not many wingers in the same class as this guy, but then again the last time I saw him play was more than a couple of years ago..."
superleague,3ckmsw,tylerderhden,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:15:49 2015 UTC,"No quota spot as he has played for Ireland. Duport isn't a winger he is a centre. Don't forget Yaha is only 18, don't wanna pressure him too much. I think it's a decent sizing as long as he is not on a shed load of money."
superleague,3ckmsw,rugby_league,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:46:43 2015 UTC,"My mistake then, thought Duport was a winger!  I think you look at Escare and the confidence they put in him and you'd want the same for Yaha which was why I put it forward."
superleague,3ckmsw,dale_dale,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:54:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do agree. I would stick with Yaha but I can see why they've signed him. Direct replacement for Oldfield. I bet Inu will go to Hull or play in the centre to replace Pomeroy who is leaving apparently. That leaves Richards/Duport/Yaha as your wingers. Christ we need plenty of backs anyway, have you seen our injury list this year. At Salford we had Pomeroy (3) and Dureau (7) of our backline from beginning of the season, 2 out of 7 haha!"

For me, frequently playing at these massive stadiums, and added to the fact that Aussies are pretty much silent, just makes it sound absolutely shit (especially watching on TV). Only captivating thing about the NRL is how much better the quality of rugby is."
superleague,3cgmc7,DrHydeous,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:29:05 2015 UTC,"The sound is partly down to how the broadcaster has chosen to mix it, and this varies a lot from one broadcaster to another and one country to another.

The atmosphere is pretty dire,  at best everyone has a roll up cardbord program that makes a loud noise when hit into your hand. They do clap clap clap Goth-en-burg. Its boring as.   Other than that they have a dedicated signing section that has a special spot light on them so you can see them. To be fair they don't shut up ever - it's just they also dont have any variety in songs. I love our improvised comical chants against opposition players etc and the general wide variety of songs.   The Ozzies admiration for our crowds seems to be a fairly consistent comment on every video of the SL, and I remember during the world cup there was a massive amount of comments on the atmosphere. It is certainly helped by terraces and appropriate sized grounds so they are mostly full."

It's why I don't think sinfield moving will be that big of a blow as he'll still be around to speak to etc.  It's McDermott's rotation policy which confuses me. We routinely don't use a sub player or he gets 5 minutes. It'll happen on Thursday judging by the squad.

superleague,3c81x1,MLA92,3,Sun Jul 5 19:45:08 2015 UTC,Can't wait for the KR v FC game!  Can't see Salford or Widnes getting out of it. I reckon FC will join them with KR and Catalan just escaping. Wire should be fine with Wakey to play this weekend.
superleague,3c81x1,will_leeds,2,Sun Jul 5 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"Widnes or Salford would have to win all their games. I've put them in as they are still able but with KR v FC playing, it's doubtful they can get there.  Wire seem to struggle against the smaller sides. They're probably happy they play Saints soon!  I've also whipped up a little spreadsheet of which teams would play which but not sure where to post it or something like that."
superleague,3c81x1,will_leeds,2,Sun Jul 5 20:33:51 2015 UTC,"They beat Wakey 80-0 though. I know it's a while ago, but they should beat them again.  The fixture grids are available here, not sure if that's the same as the spreadsheet you've got?"

superleague,3c81x1,mynameismatt_,3,Mon Jul 6 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's going to more or less stay how it is but for me the Hull derby is the the decider for 8th spot.  And wow I actually keep forgetting Wire are that ""low"" in the table. They'll be fine of course. Even though we have home advantage I'm probably most nervous about that match of our remaining fixtures."
superleague,3c81x1,supercharv,2,Sun Jul 5 20:33:25 2015 UTC,"As a Bradford fan, I really don't want Catalan for either their squad or the chance of playing them away, but I think they might win Widnes and then Huddersfield at home anyway. I'd probably expect it to stay the same as it is now, maybe Salford could get 2 wins to move up to 9th as I'd back Hull FC to beat KR."
superleague,3c81x1,mynameismatt_,2,Sun Jul 5 21:10:52 2015 UTC,What do you think to your chances come the middle eight? Seen alot of Leigh in the cup buy nothing of Bradford. Seem to be doing well though
superleague,3c81x1,DrHydeous,3,Mon Jul 6 08:09:20 2015 UTC,"Could finish 5th so get into that million pound game, but we haven't been good enough recently (that featherstone result wasn't just a fluke). If Gaskell is back soon then we should be able to compete but I don't think we'll go up automatically, not really good enough.   Leigh can play as shown against Warrington but could be caught out if they play dirty. I reckon it'll be Leigh 2nd or 3rd, Wakefield down and Bradford against Widnes or Salford but not too confident."
superleague,3c81x1,DrHydeous,2,Mon Jul 6 11:22:41 2015 UTC,"Warrington should beat Wakefield, lose to Saints, and it's hard to call their match against Castleford, so let's award them three points.  Widnes and Leeds at home should beat Catalans. Catalans at home can beat the Giants, but I'm not confident enough to say that they will. So let's say Catalans get one point.  I can't see Hull FC beating both Castleford and Wigan, but maybe one of them. The derby is a toss-up. Three points.  Hull KR should beat Salford but lose to Saints. Three points.  Widnes will lose to Wigan but probably beat Salford. Four points.  Salford should lose to Leeds. No points.  So ...    Place Team Points    6 Warrington 23   7 Catalans 21   8 Hull FC 21   9 Hull KR 21   10 Widnes 19   11 Salford 15    So Warrington will get through, and if we assume that my indecision leads to a draw, Catalans and the Hulls will come down to points difference. I don't think KR will be able to score enough points to overcome their 40 point deficit from Hull FC. Catalans and Hull FC might swap places.  Now, I gave Catalans one point for the Giants match, and the Hulls one each for the derby, because I couldn't decide. So yeah, the Hull derby matters. Whoever wins that gets 22 points and the loser 20 points:    Place Team Points    6 Warrington 23   7 Hull derby winner 22   8 Catalans 21   9 Hull derby loser 20   10 Widnes 19   11 Salford 15    If Catalans win, they get 22 points as well, so the winner of the Hull derby and Catalans both stay in the top 8. But if Catalans lose they only get 20 points:    Place Team Points    6 Warrington 23   7 Hull derby winner 22   8 Hull derby loser 20   9 Catalans 20   10 Widnes 19   11 Salford 15    so it comes down to points difference between the loser of the Hull derby and Catalans. I can't see Hull KR making up that big points difference, or Catalans losing hard enough to make it up for them, but FC could.  So the Catalan/Giants game also matters a hell of a lot.  In summary, if Catalans win the Hull derby winner is in the top 8 and the loser is in the middle eight. If Catalans lose, and FC lose FC might have scored enough points to make the top 8. If Catalans lose and KR lose I don't think KR can make the top 8.  I'm now expecting someone to tell me I double-counted a game or something. Here, have a pre-emptive ""Oops"".  [Update: I originally gave Widnes three points for their two predicted wins. I've fixed that, but it doesn't change the results]"

McGuire is still an SL legend though and is still adding to his all-time SL try scorer record. International rugby is a different story all together and England were held back for a few years because of the Saints v Rhinos rivalry around the 2008 world cup, 15 of the 24 man squad were from those teams and they hated each other and it just didn't work. Sinfield is another example of someone who's not performed at international level but is still one of the best players SL has seen."

superleague,3bz5mq,CaptainMexicano,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:38:20 2015 UTC,Hope not! Wouldn't mind some silverware for Cas!!!
superleague,3bz5mq,Maasterix,3,Fri Jul 3 21:37:47 2015 UTC,Dominated!!  Nice one lads!
superleague,3bz5mq,TexturePackReview,2,Fri Jul 3 20:51:17 2015 UTC,Leeds have been simple superb.
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:47:11 2015 UTC,"What's happened today? This was supposed to be edge of the seat, close game! Fantastic for us!"
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:45:40 2015 UTC,They will probably have to come back to Headingley as this should have wrapped up 1st spot (who play 2nd and 3rd at home).  Surely Saints can't play this bad for a third time at the end of the month?
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:48:15 2015 UTC,A tl;dr of Leeds' season.  Can we play St Helens every week and please don't let us play Warrington every week.
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,2,Fri Jul 3 20:45:37 2015 UTC,"Ash Handley gets his second hat-trick, making it 6 tries in 2 games against St Helens in his career!  What was Percival doing there? Is he that scared of Watkins?"
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:41:01 2015 UTC,Would you drop him for briscoe? Don't think I could
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:44:28 2015 UTC,"I would have done a couple weeks ago, but when he got his hat trick last game against St Helens he had a really good next few weeks."

superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:36:59 2015 UTC,Peacock has been off the field twice tonight. How often does that happen!?
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,2,Fri Jul 3 20:32:06 2015 UTC,Fucking fantastic!
superleague,3bz5mq,SupervillainIndiana,2,Fri Jul 3 20:26:33 2015 UTC,Can we have 12 men more often!? That was an absolutely fantastic try!!
superleague,3bz5mq,halftone84,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:26:13 2015 UTC,Probs deserved a yellow there...
superleague,3bz5mq,SupervillainIndiana,2,Fri Jul 3 20:19:34 2015 UTC,Hall at full back!! Must be the biggest full back I've ever seen.
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,2,Fri Jul 3 20:19:59 2015 UTC,I think my heart missed a beat when he showed that red first there!  Yellow card is fair. Really poor tackle.
superleague,3bz5mq,supersonicdeathsquad,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:19:16 2015 UTC,Ditto.  Is hall at full back?
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,2,Fri Jul 3 20:20:09 2015 UTC,He seems to be a full back/winger hybrid judging by where he's lining up on attack and defence!
superleague,3bz5mq,supersonicdeathsquad,2,Fri Jul 3 20:22:13 2015 UTC,"This is one of those fixtures where I see it in the TV listings and think ""ooh this is going to be amazing!""  But not this night. It's like St Helens forgot to get off the bus in the first half."
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:15:24 2015 UTC,"These pundits have nothing on the BBC! Ah well, at least I get to watch the games"
superleague,3bz5mq,portuguesekoala,2,Fri Jul 3 20:01:45 2015 UTC,"Eddie and stevo are better than having to listen to Jonathan Davies shit, and that's saying something !!!"

superleague,3bz5mq,portuguesekoala,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:03:58 2015 UTC,But you get people to disagree with him like Nobel or eorl
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,2,Fri Jul 3 20:51:26 2015 UTC,Wells and Carney are actually really good analysts.  I'd love to see a current player with Sky all the time like the BBC do with Peacock and Wilkin. Get the current players in now to do more media work and you'll reap the rewards in 5/10 years.  Bring the youth through I say! That young whipper snapper Peacock looks good.
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,2,Fri Jul 3 20:10:04 2015 UTC,"When your defense has been ok but you've managed to lose the game by half time you know your ball handling has been atrocious.    We could say that ""injuries have taken their toll"" or that ""Leeds are too clinical"" but there's no excuse for putting the ball down in those areas so many times."
superleague,3bz5mq,portuguesekoala,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:53:39 2015 UTC,"It's the areas you're putting the ball down which is the biggest thing. Yes, Leeds have made errors too but we've done most of it in your half.  It's pretty much the same game as it was at Langtree Park earlier this season."
superleague,3bz5mq,portuguesekoala,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:55:47 2015 UTC,"I know. It's frustrating, I cant really speak for Flemming, Dawson and Savello but I know the rest are capable of taking the game to Leeds and maybe snatching a win, instead they just fold."
superleague,3bz5mq,portuguesekoala,3,Fri Jul 3 20:02:20 2015 UTC,Really happy for Ash Handley here. He's had a rough month or two but that's going to do his confidence the world of good.  Bear in mind Handley is only 19 and wasn't even supposed to play this season or probably next.
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:50:31 2015 UTC,"He's done great this season!  Gold first half despite the errors, imagine saints will be physical after half time"
superleague,3bz5mq,portuguesekoala,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:51:19 2015 UTC,Leeds are too clinical
superleague,3bz5mq,portuguesekoala,2,Fri Jul 3 19:50:27 2015 UTC,I almost can't laugh from a Leeds point of view at that from Percival. Saints seem to be turning over the ball close to their line compared to Leeds.  We can't keep hold of the ball and we're 18-0 up. Not really sure how.
superleague,3bz5mq,nightss,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:46:26 2015 UTC,Sooooo many errors
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,2,Fri Jul 3 19:46:10 2015 UTC,If he would have caught that it would have been a sure try
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:38:05 2015 UTC,"Phew!  On another note, what is this state of mind thing?"
superleague,3bz5mq,nightss,2,Fri Jul 3 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"It was born out of Terry Newton's death after his problems with Depression. Trying to kill the whole attitude about mental health in sport as it's not seen as ""manly"" and all that."
superleague,3bz5mq,nightss,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:37:50 2015 UTC,Not a steal? Clearly went for it...ah well
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:30:26 2015 UTC,Haha like that vid form this week 'DONT LET IT BOUNCE'
superleague,3bz5mq,philmorpeth,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:29:24 2015 UTC,Wasn't much difference! Keinhorst's pick up was outstanding there. He's probably our most in form player the past month although once other players are fit he won't be in the 17.
superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:31:18 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing, shame he dropped it that turn of pace was very good"

superleague,3bz5mq,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"Leeds are turned on tonight though, could be a blow out if saints aren't careful"
superleague,3bz5mq,paulusmagintie,2,Fri Jul 3 19:18:40 2015 UTC,We're not playing well. Saints are just having an absolute shocker so far.
superleague,3bz5mq,paulusmagintie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:19:54 2015 UTC,third try right on queue haha
superleague,3bz5mq,TexturePackReview,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:21:07 2015 UTC,so many handling errors so far
superleague,3bz5mq,TexturePackReview,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:17:32 2015 UTC,"Saints pushing the forehead into Leeds players in the ruck, wonder if the ref will notice!  Another handling error, great chance for us"

superleague,3bz96h,supercharv,4,Fri Jul 3 10:23:06 2015 UTC,I'd love this to happen.   Bit of a scuffle breaks out 'They're fighting like beavers Eddie'

superleague,3bz96h,MLA92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:13:29 2015 UTC,Wouldn't say no at all. Although we desperately need a change in presentation.
superleague,3bw8q0,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,4,Thu Jul 2 17:44:38 2015 UTC,"If this is true Koukash is such a fucking dog! He did the same to Nobby 'I don't want you as head coach any more, but I want you to be insert position...oh and if you don't accept within 48 hours you'll be sacked' I'm not saying he's offered LH another position but Nobby was sacked for no reason and LH will be sacked when he needs to look at the playing staff. So many players in that team either playing only for money, have personality clashes with other people or just simply not giving 100%. He needs to concentrate on the youth system at Salford, install a bit of pride passion and love for the club that you get when a young kid has been there for years...look at Wigan their academy is fucking awesome."
superleague,3bw8q0,Blaster_3487,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:40:02 2015 UTC,"Wigan their academy is fucking awesome   Very true, i played against Ince Rose Bridge who had a full team but 1 who had all been signed by Wigan at u-16 level e.g. George Burgess and a few others. But they get such a good academy as they're a top team, they get the first picks essentially them and Saints at signing any good kids within the areas of the north.  One thing that winds me up though is Salford don't scout much in Salford. Mostly because it's dominated by football but... They look in the Hull and Wigan/St Helens areas. Meaning we basically get the  shit no-one else wants, sometimes they turn good a nice hidden gem like Ratchford, Myler and Evalds but... More crap than good"
superleague,3bw8q0,supercharv,2,Fri Jul 3 11:47:19 2015 UTC,And replaced by the director of football by any chance?
superleague,3bw8q0,supercharv,2,Thu Jul 2 17:45:16 2015 UTC,I expected that myself as soon as i heard he was director... But no news as of yet just speculation. Ian Watson is taking over for our next game apparently...
superleague,3bw8q0,CaptainMexicano,2,Thu Jul 2 17:46:31 2015 UTC,"This is from today at some point...saying roughly the same, not gone yet but in talks regarding leaving"

superleague,3buyx4,J1mjam2112,3,Thu Jul 2 10:52:00 2015 UTC,I disagree with this on such a high level.
superleague,3buyx4,sloppyfeashes,2,Thu Jul 2 11:02:35 2015 UTC,/u/teasizzle.... FIGHT! just kidding.  I would love to open up discussion on this.  If the same thing happened with Wigan and Saints.  I would be apprehensive.  But if the circumstances where similar in such a way that both teams were mid table and hoping to return to the good days. I can see it being beneficial for both.
superleague,3buyx4,sloppyfeashes,2,Thu Jul 2 11:12:42 2015 UTC,"Hull FC's academy is rated outstanding and we're 3rd in the league. Hull KR's academy is rated good and they're 5th in the league. The only thing a merger will do is limit the amount of players we can bring into the scholarship system, and then cause fights between the clubs about which players they want to offer a full time contract to. The only way this can work is of the two first teams merge, and let's not even get into that. Oh, and they'll be playing in yellow and blue, yuck."
superleague,3buyx4,teasizzle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:16:48 2015 UTC,Yellow and Blue?! What the actual fuck.
superleague,3buyx4,sloppyfeashes,2,Thu Jul 2 11:18:16 2015 UTC,I was expecting a sort of red and black mix..

superleague,3buyx4,teasizzle,2,Thu Jul 2 11:36:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting move.  I'm not sure what to make of it right now.  But i assume they've been struggling to bring talent through, so they are joining up.  I don't know how a decision is made when both teams want to promote the same player though!"
superleague,3buyx4,teasizzle,3,Thu Jul 2 10:53:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know how a decision is made when both teams want to promote the same player though!   Same, couldn't this stop a good player coming through as well? Rather than 2 teams with starting 13s they just have one? Meaning less chance to break through?  Really didn't expect this"
superleague,3buyx4,Blaster_3487,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:08:32 2015 UTC,"Well the only reason i can see this even being as concept is if they felt that the number of players coming through wasnt high enough or they wernt good enough.  So whilst a few players might miss out, perhaps they werent good enough in the first place. Sounds harsh indeed, but business i suppose."
superleague,3buyx4,Blaster_3487,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:49:17 2015 UTC,Great idea. No point in having the two clubs working against each other when trying to develop the talent from in and around the city.  Some of the comments on both FC's and KR's Facebook pages are embarrassing.
superleague,3buyx4,Mr_Mogli,2,Thu Jul 2 10:57:25 2015 UTC,Good to see the opinion of a fan.. I know there is a lot of animosity there so it doesn't surprise me.  Facebook comments are dire at the best of times.
superleague,3buyx4,MLA92,3,Thu Jul 2 10:59:48 2015 UTC,"I can see past the rivalry. I'm a fan of the game first and an FC fan second.  Hudgell says it best: ""Both we and Hull FC have ambitions of competing in the upper echelons of Super League on a consistent basis but we need to work together to make both clubs stronger because I’m sure every rugby league fan in the city would love a return to the glory days of the 1980s when both sides regularly competed in finals."""

superleague,3bugsm,Blaster_3487,2,Thu Jul 2 07:41:16 2015 UTC,Currently there is a lot of debate between the fans over this. Not sure of it myself.   There is more on the clubs homepage.
superleague,3bugsm,MLA92,2,Thu Jul 2 06:35:22 2015 UTC,I'm assuming they have done it mid season to distract from some of the poor on pitch performances. But reading my Facebook feed there are many disappointed fans.  I'm pretty sure there are going to be a lot of tattooed fans with the old logo complaining also.
superleague,3bugsm,J1mjam2112,2,Thu Jul 2 07:44:31 2015 UTC,"There doesn't seem to be any real point behind it. I get the history aspect of it having watched the video, but there wasn't anything wrong with the old one.  The cost of changing everything must be fairly hefty too I guess?"
superleague,3bugsm,J1mjam2112,2,Thu Jul 2 08:01:30 2015 UTC,I've heard 50k for the logo. Not sure how much truth in that though
superleague,3bugsm,Drewdle883,2,Thu Jul 2 11:09:19 2015 UTC,"Its a bit more 'NRL' style in my opinion.  At least it feels that way.  Frankly is awful. Mid season too, whats all that about? Maybe they should be concentrating on the games rather than what the logo looks like."
superleague,3bugsm,sloppyfeashes,3,Thu Jul 2 09:45:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit more MLS style. When we played you at home you unveiled Sam Tomkins, we reveal a bad logo most of us hate when you play against us."

superleague,3bqp7t,MLA92,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:37:51 2015 UTC,Desperately need a win tonight but I'm not sure how capable of that we are when we've got Abdull and Rankin in the halves.
superleague,3bqp7t,MLA92,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"I think Hull FC will win but Wakey have a very good chance I think because the new signings and the new coach will have them working better in defence. No idea what this Sio is like though. Locke is pure class and he has no pressure on him really. Tansey to centre, Ryan back to 2nd row."
superleague,3bo0fb,teasizzle,3,Tue Jun 30 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, so original.  Wasn't worth an unveiling."
superleague,3bo0fb,halftone84,3,Tue Jun 30 23:49:15 2015 UTC,"Lets be honest guys, who didn't expect a 98% white shirt with a dash of red?   That's the England shirt since 1000 years ago, change it and you look like the St.George Dragons, St.Helens or Wigan."
superleague,3bo0fb,paulusmagintie,2,Wed Jul 1 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"Not a fan, though BLK would come up with an interesting design.  It's very similar to this from 2010."
superleague,3bo0fb,Mr_Mogli,2,Tue Jun 30 23:17:53 2015 UTC,Looks no different than the usual...
superleague,3bmxbu,MLA92,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:45:11 2015 UTC,"Headingly! Called it ;)   Friday July 31 - Leeds Rhinos v St Helens, BBC Two 8pm  Saturday August 1 - Warrington Wolves v Hull Kingston Rovers  12.45pm, BBC One"
superleague,3bmxbu,supercharv,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:28:27 2015 UTC,First time since 1999 I think a semi has been played at Headingley. I shall be going to both games I imagine!
superleague,3bmxbu,supercharv,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:30:57 2015 UTC,I'm hoping to go to our semi final - I should be back in the UK for a couple of weeks!   It would be awesome - any idea how much a ticket would be?
superleague,3bmxbu,supercharv,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:43:07 2015 UTC,Western terrace not open by the looks of it. South stand is £20 (Hull KR have that) and Carnegie stand is also (warrington).
superleague,3bmxbu,will_leeds,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"No no, our semi final! As in the prices for the Leeds game at Warrington? I imagine it will be similar! I couldn't find tickets yet when I had a look a couple of hours back...  I imagine they will fill the stands opposite the main TV camera first, as they tended to do for other TV games"
superleague,3bmxbu,supercharv,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:16:39 2015 UTC,Whoops! It's apparently £20 seating behind the sticks and £25 pound to stand along the side but not sure if they have that the wrong way round maybe.
superleague,3bmxbu,will_leeds,2,Tue Jun 30 17:58:42 2015 UTC,I tweeted Rhinos asking about that but got no response. I've never known terracing to cost more than seats and Warrington's normal prices are £24 in the seated end and £20 standing.
superleague,3bmxbu,sloppyfeashes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:09:56 2015 UTC,any reply to the tweet?
superleague,3bmxbu,Blaster_3487,2,Wed Jul 1 11:12:46 2015 UTC,Pricing is correct...
superleague,3bmxbu,paulusmagintie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:29:00 2015 UTC,"Not yet. I was thinking though...it's been done to make the prices fair to each set of fans. It would be harsh on Saints if we had more cheap tickets available. The way it is now, we have an end each at £20 and a side each at £25."
superleague,3bmxbu,paulusmagintie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:58:44 2015 UTC,Think I just saw your tweet to the RFL!  Madness that it's right. It's more than Warrington charge on a normal match day!
superleague,3bmxbu,DrHydeous,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:28:48 2015 UTC,Does it save money? Using the grounds of two of the semi-finalists..
superleague,3bn5qz,teasizzle,2,Tue Jun 30 15:47:26 2015 UTC,Shouldn't have laid his hand on the ref. Wire fan
superleague,3bn5qz,Ste-phen,2,Tue Jun 30 19:14:49 2015 UTC,Agreed. As shit as they can be a player should never make physical contact with an official!
superleague,3bn5qz,CaptainMexicano,-1,Tue Jun 30 20:18:09 2015 UTC,Unbelievable...  What's the difference? 2 games and 7 games Gareth Hock  No fucking consistency
superleague,3bn5qz,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,2,Tue Jun 30 21:59:13 2015 UTC,"This was Hock's THIRD citing and banning for such an offence. First while playing for Wigan in 2008. The ref had given a try and Hock grabbed the ref by his arm and spun him around[!]. Second while playing for Widnes in 2013. Should Currie do this twice more, I would expect the same level of ban."
superleague,3bn5qz,Reaydingles,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:20:11 2015 UTC,Can you remember what happened to Hock after the first offence?
superleague,3bn5qz,J1mjam2112,2,Wed Jul 1 10:32:22 2015 UTC,"It was a five match ban. But he literally manhandled the referee. I was at the game, and I think Bentham was refereeing. To the best of my knowledge, the referee had given a try, Hock disagreed with it and he grabbed Bentham by the arm and spun him a full 180 degrees. Straight red and 5 match ban."
superleague,3bn5qz,Reaydingles,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:10:32 2015 UTC,"I was there also.  Yep, idiot.  So much potential gone to waste with that fella"
superleague,3bn5qz,J1mjam2112,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:26:01 2015 UTC,"Google says 5 games..  Source  5 games for first offence, 4 games for second offence and 7 games for third offence."
superleague,3bn5qz,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:49:34 2015 UTC,"in that case, i should think Currie would be walking away with at least a 4.  Whether Hocks reputation for other things affected it... who knows."
superleague,3bn5qz,J1mjam2112,2,Wed Jul 1 12:41:38 2015 UTC,"I think yeah, it more the fact he is probably in trouble 2/3 times a season... Probably sick of seeing him"
superleague,3bn5qz,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:26:45 2015 UTC,"Well you live and learn...   Someone asked me had he done this before but I had no idea he had, fair enough"
superleague,3bn5qz,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,3,Wed Jul 1 10:47:37 2015 UTC,It's actually detailed in the column you shared as evidence...
superleague,3bn5qz,Reaydingles,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:15:27 2015 UTC,"Didn't read it, just took the headline"
superleague,3bn5qz,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,2,Wed Jul 1 13:25:38 2015 UTC,"Think reading your sources might be a hint for the future, fella."
superleague,3bn5qz,Reaydingles,0,Wed Jul 1 15:48:08 2015 UTC,"No need, i'll just take the headline, fella."
superleague,3biy91,supercharv,2,Mon Jun 29 16:39:41 2015 UTC,Lets see if he gets anything close to what Hock got when he did this
superleague,3biy91,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,2,Tue Jun 30 11:48:21 2015 UTC,He probably won't. Didn't Hock do this a few times though?
superleague,3biy91,Blaster_3487,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:19:04 2015 UTC,two game ban
superleague,3biy91,They-Took-Our-Jerbs,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"Not to a ref I don't think, but as we both know he's always in trouble"
superleague,3biy91,Blaster_3487,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:18:03 2015 UTC,So will his ban be for the CC Semi or will SL games count towards it?
superleague,3biy91,Blaster_3487,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:56:56 2015 UTC,I presume it will count towards SL as the Hull player was out against us in the CC after the SL ban

superleague,3bho9r,Blaster_3487,2,Mon Jun 29 08:35:12 2015 UTC,i'll be gutted to see him go. thought he might be off when we signed lama tasi.  any news on who the full back we're after?
superleague,3bho9r,rickyyy82,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:26:48 2015 UTC,No idea who the full back is. Are Saints getting a marquee signing for next season?
superleague,3bho9r,Mr_Mogli,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:34:57 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling we'll make Roby our marquee and then save the difference between his current salary (£200k, maybe more) and the £100K that a home grown marquee only counts for on the cap."
superleague,3bho9r,paulusmagintie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:06:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think Roby would ever leave, St.Helens is his childhood club, Roby and Makinson are main stays at the club that I can assure you.  Swift probably too, if anything if they leave they end up at square one having to learn a new team, look what happened to Daryl Clark when he moved to Warrington, not half as good as when he was at Castleford."
superleague,3bho9r,J1mjam2112,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:40:32 2015 UTC,"Roby and Makinson are main stays at the club that I can assure you.   Agree with Roby I think, but you never know.  Re: Makinson, he's a Wigan fan.  My friend went to school with him, Saints just happened to give him his first chance.  Not saying he will go to Wigan, just saying that his feelings towards Saints might not be what you think, and it wouldn't surprise me if he leaves some day."
superleague,3bho9r,paulusmagintie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:16:16 2015 UTC,"Jamie Foster left Saints and tried to go to Wigan and you never heard from him again.  I think Makinson will stay until he isn't wanted anymore, he's got enough class to get into Wigan if he wanted I feel."
superleague,3bho9r,J1mjam2112,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:49:07 2015 UTC,"If charnley doesn't re find his form once burgess leaves then we have a space for a new winger. Otherwise we're good. Foster fell out of favour with saints way before he left due to poor performances, similar to what is happening to charnley right now. He may have wished to join wigan but the fact he left was as much to do with saints as it was to do with foster.   If makinson continues to improve the way he has, I don't think he will fade away like foster. He will leave for a new challenge if anything. Again, I don't think he's aiming for wigan at all, I'm just saying that he might not be that loyal when another team comes knocking.   He could however end up like Paul deacon and spend his whole career at saints and then retire at wigan. ;)"
superleague,3bho9r,Mr_Mogli,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:31:10 2015 UTC,"Shame to see him leave as his performances are becoming more consistent this year, good luck to him for back home."

For those like me out of the country, here is /u/Mr_Mogli comment on his other thread with international links!"
superleague,3bftf0,supercharv,4,Sun Jun 28 22:39:05 2015 UTC,Good sportsmanship at the end.
superleague,3bftf0,CaptainMexicano,3,Sun Jun 28 21:56:22 2015 UTC,Great advertisement for the sport - I like Sims and this attitude is exactly what you want from a player in your team.
superleague,3bf1n8,supersonicdeathsquad,4,Sun Jun 28 17:15:17 2015 UTC,Love it when the draw falls so that it guarantees that one of the lower league teams will definitely get to Wembley.
superleague,3bf1n8,Mr_Mogli,2,Sun Jun 28 17:30:36 2015 UTC,"As a Wire fan, I'd rather see us get Leeds/Saints in the final so I'm happy with the draw. If we can play the way we did on Saturday we should do well. Only concern is our injuries are piling up now too with Laithwaite being out for the rest of the season and Monaghan being on the cusp of recovery. Either way I can't wait for it as it's on BBC, since leaving Warrington I can't watch as much as I'd like now."

superleague,3bf1n8,supercharv,2,Mon Jun 29 16:21:34 2015 UTC,Should both be on the Beeb as they have the broadcasting rights to the Challenge Cup.
superleague,3bf1n8,T-Bizzle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:35:50 2015 UTC,As a neutral Leeds V KR final ;)
superleague,3bf1n8,supercharv,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:17:43 2015 UTC,I'm well happy with Warrington. They'll be out for revenge for 2 weeks ago but we'll want to get to wembley. Leeds v Saints will be a cracker of a game....heart over rules head and it'll be a Rovers Leeds final.
superleague,3bf1n8,Blaster_3487,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:20:15 2015 UTC,"Yeh, I'd agree Leeds are probably favourites. Hopefully we'll have some numbers back from the treatment room by then."
superleague,3bf1n8,MLA92,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:55:01 2015 UTC,Interesting that they're showing one of the ties on the Friday night instead of the Sunday.  I reckon Hull KR v Warrington at Huddersfield and Leeds v Saints at Warrington.
superleague,3bf1n8,will_leeds,2,Sun Jun 28 17:21:23 2015 UTC,BBC have the Arsenal v Chelsea community shield on the Sunday hence a semi being moved to the Friday. Both the DW and Galpharm are football-free that weekend too so Leeds v Saints could be at the DW if the RFL want it.
superleague,3bf1n8,supercharv,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:32:58 2015 UTC,"Yeh that makes sense, good stadiums both."
superleague,3bf1n8,MLA92,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:54:10 2015 UTC,Hull KR v Warrington at Huddersfield   Could that game be at Leeds or is that against the rules as we're in the other game?
superleague,3bf1n8,halftone84,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:40:28 2015 UTC,"No, it could be but I doubt it. Semi finals are rarely held at places other than Wigan, Leigh, Warrington, St Helens, Huddersfield and Doncaster these days I think."
superleague,3bf1n8,supercharv,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:44:53 2015 UTC,"Balls. I'd kept off Facebook, I'm 2 minutes into the saints game."
superleague,3bf1n8,halftone84,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:24:20 2015 UTC,Did you watch all of the game? It was fairly entertaining
superleague,3bfaet,supercharv,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:31:35 2015 UTC,"I'd say Rovers could beat Salford but we are resting a few key players such as McCarthy, Sio and Boudebza. I think we have enough to beat them but it'll be hard."
superleague,3bf39e,supercharv,4,Sun Jun 28 17:28:56 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go with this great mans retirement from the game.
