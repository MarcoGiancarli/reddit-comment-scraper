The blade will be flawless, the steel carefully chosen, treated and tempered.  You'll own it for a lifetime, it will function perfectly, and be a conversation piece.

ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,hungryhungryME,4,Tue Jul 21 13:40:16 2015 UTC,"Very cool process.   One thing I am not too keen on, though, is that you are not demonstrating good safety in a shop or safe operation of a lathe.  You should never be holding your work with your hands while it is being turned. There is almost certainly something you can rig up on the tail stock to hold your work from turning rather than feeding it in by hand. Doing that is just asking for you to slip, or for the work to jam and your hand getting chewed up by your drill/chuck. I can't tell if the RPM is so low that it's not as big of an issue but either way you would be safer with proper work holding.  Wearing gloves while in a shop is also bad. I'm not sure why you're wearing them but unless they will tear off like paper if it gets caught in a machine you probably should avoid wearing them. Looks to me like something already happened with them since they got chewed up a bit on your left index finger.  And for the love of all that matters, take your damn ring off before entering your shop and operating machinery, especially when you are unnecessarily introducing your hand to a machine that will clean your finger right off if it gets caught! This goes for all machines including the bandsaw and bench grinders! This one really bothers me because it's so basic, and if you've been working in a shop professionally for any length of time you should know better."
ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,hungryhungryME,3,Tue Jul 21 12:42:16 2015 UTC,I was going to comment similarly. Wood workers always seem to take the biggest risks with machines! It's wince-inducing to watch coming from a machining background.
ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,Davecasa,3,Tue Jul 21 13:08:06 2015 UTC,"I hear you.  I've gotten better through the years, but there are areas for improvement for sure.     The hand drilling operation is safer than it looks.  The lathe is operating at low rpms.  Additionally, my lathes are all belt-driven and I am able to stop them (when at low rpm) by hand if necessary. I only use gloves for the final polishing to keep hand oils off the finish.  Very little danger here. You're totally right regarding the ring.  I've gone through periods where I'll take it off to work.   tl;dr Just because I've avoided injury for a dozen years doesn't mean I can't lose my finger in a moment.  Safety is important."
ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,Junkbot,6,Tue Jul 21 15:31:13 2015 UTC,Is the mouthpiece always made of rubber? Is it OK for it to be in your mouth while sucking in hot smoke?
ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,Davecasa,13,Mon Jul 20 23:11:47 2015 UTC,"It's a very, very hard rubber.  The same material (from the same supplier) as that used to make Mont Blanc pens and high end woodwind mouthpieces.  The smoke heat is not an issue at all.  Ebonite has been used for this purpose for more than 100 years and is in millions and millions of pipes.  I also use antique bakelite on occasion."
ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,Freshmakerer,5,Tue Jul 21 00:40:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation. I know nothing about pipes and knowing that using vulcanized rubber is common practice is good to know. Lovely pipes; definitely something that I would want to get into.   Are you familiar with cigars? How would you describe pipes vs cigars?
ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,Mac1822,11,Tue Jul 21 01:05:54 2015 UTC,"My pleasure.    I am familiar with cigars.  I'm a novice at best, but I can tell a good stick from bad.  I like to think of them like comparing wines and spirits.  Cigars have a narrow flavor range like wines do.  There are many varieties, but the flavor profiles, once you are buying good cigars, are not as dramatically different as are pipe tobaccos.    Pipe tobaccos are like spirits in that whiskeys, gins, vodkas, brandies, etc are all vastly different than one another.  And within each of those styles there are major variations.  Plus, with a pipe, you are left with a beautifully crafted tool when you are finished and you can use it for decades.  I'm happy to share more, but don't want to bore you.  :-)"
ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,Theist17,4,Tue Jul 21 01:27:14 2015 UTC,"As a lover of spirits, you had my attention at 'wines and spirits'. In that sense, does it make any sense to make pipe tobacco 'cocktails' by mixing different kinds?  How would you recommend properly getting into the hobby?"
ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,SierraNovember2,5,Tue Jul 21 01:30:27 2015 UTC,"It does indeed!  There are plenty of premade blends (and some are truly sublime) and other offerings that are akin to single malts.    If you're in a city, you may find that there is a pipe club for you to attend.  If not, you can check out /r/pipetobacco or search around the to find any of the dozens of forums for enthusiasts and collectors."
ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,accidentallywut,2,Tue Jul 21 01:34:36 2015 UTC,"The rubber is vulcanized, which is another way of saying it's ""cured"". Another way to think it about is that the rubber has turned into something akin to a hard plastic. The smoke from a pipe isn't that hot either. If it was, it would burn your mouth. Think about it... it's sitting in a wood bowl. If it was so hot as to do something to the rubber, wouldn't it burn the wood too?"
ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,accidentallywut,3,Tue Jul 21 00:36:20 2015 UTC,"I used to smoke a pipe from time to time, and it certainly did burn my mouth on occasion! More specifically my tongue, but that had more to do with me not knowing how to properly pack a pipe. Tightly packed tobacco forces you to puff on it pretty hard, which can really raise the temperature of the burn."
ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,the_whining_beaver,5,Tue Jul 21 01:04:48 2015 UTC,"Tongue burn is definitely linked to smoking very sweet tobaccos very quickly.  A tighter pack and slower pace will help prevent it.  Find a pipe smoking mentor, if you want to pick it back up.  Seriously.  It takes time, good instruction, and practice to get right."
ArtisanVideos,3dyrtj,An0k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:22:46 2015 UTC,"Ha! Yeah, I smoked a pipe for a few years and finally got the hang of it by the end, but there is certainly a lot of practice that went into it. No more smoking for me these days, though - maybe when I retire I'll pick it up again :)"

What a glorious moment when I have my own house and can really go to town on premiumizing everything through my own skill and intellect.  On the same note, I've been reading about electric guitars, and it turns out that one can build quite an amazing electric guitar for under $1000. Turns out that pickups just read the vibration of the strings through magnetic resonance, so the wood hardly matters. IE. buckethead's guitars, you can attach a guitar setup (pickups, bridge, and strings) to pretty much anything, even a piece of plywood, and you will get the same sound. You might get a different attack, sustain, etc..because of the material, but the sound remains the same. And thus, premium guitars are somewhat of a brand-name trap.  And the same would go for cabinets and most other things that the average person just buys off the spot. I love this subreddit because it exposes what goes on behind good products. Most can be done by ones self at a higher quality if one takes the time to understand the process.  My 2c."

( i'm not counting department store skateboards, which are not real skateboards, and are made of whatever is cheap and readily available. sometime even poplar)  and skateboarding is really  hard on skateboards. they wear out and need to be replaced frequently. and the better you get at skateboarding, the harder you are on your equipment. a lot pros set up a new deck almost every time they go skate. and if it's a bad day, they might go through a few boards just to film one trick.  so anything more sustainable is obviously a good thing. there are a couple companies using bamboo and other stuff, but so far, nothing ""feels"" like 7 plies of maple molded under pressure."

ArtisanVideos,3dqazz,nytrons,3,Sun Jul 19 13:40:49 2015 UTC,"i used to think that way. then i spent some time working as a skateboard filmer. the amount of pressure (from both themselves and their sponsors) these dudes are often under is insane. most guys have at least a board sponsor, a truck sponsor, a wheel sponsor, and a clothing sponsor, sometimes more. and each of those sponsors expects fresh footage constantly. and the big unwritten skateboarding rulebook says it has to be FRESH footage. meaning that if you do a trick someone else has already done at that spot, the footage isn't usable. this results in a constant search for new spots, and obviously increased stress levels.  add to that the fact that most filming is done on demo tours. for the unfamiliar, that's 8-10 dudes in a van, driving around the country doing exhibitions and signings at skateparks and skateshops while trying to fit in filming during their off time.   so think about it. you want to try a trick. the whole team is waiting. the filmer and photographers are getting restless. it's not working. you keep almost making it, but can't seem to get both feet back on the board. you crack a deck and have to break your rhythm to set up a fresh one. you go back to the van to get a fresh deck, and get dirty looks from everyone aboard. they all want to be back at the hotel resting, because tomorrow's demo will be attended by some energy drink sponsors. you look at the driver's seat, and the team manager is texting. maybe he's texting the company owner to tell him that your window is closing, and they might want to not renew your contract next year.   so, yeah, you might know the frustration of trying to land a trick, but until your future is riding on whether or not you roll away from your next nollie flip, you simply can't understand.   as grosso said, ""disposable heros."""
ArtisanVideos,3dqazz,paulmakesthings,0,Sun Jul 19 16:57:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but while that is all true and I know exactly what you're talking about, I still don't think anything excuses that kind of behaviour.   I had dreams of being a professional filmer years ago but I just couldn't deal with these kind of guys who will always turn a disappointing day into a stressful and depressing day.  They fail to realise that this is a big part of how they are judged by sponsors; how they react when things don't go well, how likely they are to ruin things for the rest of the team if things don't go their way, how their personality comes across both on and off the board. There's more to skateboarding than just skateboarding.  Apart from that though, I think the kind of guys who stress out over a trick will still do it regardless of whether or not they're pro, on tour, in a contest or whatever. They just like to make people watch them throw pointless tantrums, and don't care if that brings down everyone around them."

ArtisanVideos,3dqazz,paulmakesthings,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:58:09 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I guess the only reason I feel like this is worth arguing about is that so many people think that it's ok. Kids getting into skating start off with the idea that this behaviour isn't just normal but expected, that if you're serious you have to show it by getting over emotional at the slightest problem.  I don't know, I guess I really just wish everyone didn't have to be so fucking cool all the time, I love watching skaters who can do amazing stuff but still look like they're having a laugh.

Their board shreds wood into pulp and then soaks the fibers in resin, so it's got to be a lot more dense. What they wound up with was paper-fiber reinforced plastic."

ArtisanVideos,3doniv,altoidsbocs,44,Sat Jul 18 00:03:05 2015 UTC,I've worked with gold leaf before and it's an incredible pain. I find the most impressive part here is them maneuvering each piece between processes without damaging it.
ArtisanVideos,3doniv,zluszcz,9,Sat Jul 18 04:40:25 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly, handled with such elegance."
ArtisanVideos,3doniv,Hauckeye,-3,Sat Jul 18 04:46:37 2015 UTC,"To my eye it was very much overhandled. Many of the steps could be combined so they don't have to keep stacking things over and over, only to unstack it on the next step.  For example that bamboo cutter should simply cut a square. Use a larger piece of paper so you don't have to restack it twice, etc. Don't just stack the paper, only to have to restack it with gold in the next step, stack the paper and gold at the same time."
ArtisanVideos,3doniv,asr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:56:52 2015 UTC,It appears that the cutter works by dragging it along the gold leaf... how would a square work?
ArtisanVideos,3doniv,P-01S,0,Tue Jul 21 00:47:58 2015 UTC,"Just press the cutter into a soft surface, it doesn't take much to cut gold that thin. I've seen a video of them doing it with a square, this is not just conjecture."
ArtisanVideos,3doniv,asr,3,Tue Jul 21 01:44:13 2015 UTC,Is every gold leaf hand made or is there some way some manufacturers make this in a factory? Or is it so delicate that machines can't make this stuff?
ArtisanVideos,3doniv,TittlesMcJizzum,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:00:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know if there has been a manufacturing process developed. The gold leaf I have used was individually layered in wax paper in 1""x 2"" pieces. Which brings me to the assumption it was hand crafted."
ArtisanVideos,3doniv,zluszcz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:17:55 2015 UTC,"It's all hand made as far as I know, but this version has a lot more handling than others. It doesn't have to be this labor (i.e. time) intensive."

A spring pole lathe is basically the same as this guy's, just with the string vertical and powered by the foot and a ""springy pole"". But with the wood moving forward, then back, forward, then back. You only cut half the time while it's moving. example  A treadle lathe is constructed quite differently (no string on the wood, requires some gearing, uses an actual crank and connecting rod), and moves the wood in a single direction allowing you to cut the entire time. example"

Say I found a rivet forge with working blower near me, FL, I'd pay $2-400 depending on the condition. Perfect condition with working blower 3-4, if I had to fix it up and the metal was rusted and pitted 1-3. That's just what I would be okay paying, I have a homemade coal and charcoal forge and a propane one too. Others might pay more or less.

ArtisanVideos,3diek3,coski,4,Thu Jul 16 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. Quenching, while it makes the steel harder, also makes it more brittle and less flexible. The ideal knife (or any tool for that matter), is soft and resilient along the spine, and hard where the tool face is. Only quenching the blade gives you a hard, durable edge, without risking snapping the blade in half at the spine if you hit it on something or pry with it (although the edge is still more fragile and shouldn't be pried with)"
ArtisanVideos,3diek3,maverickmonk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:45:20 2015 UTC,Would they want to temper it afterwards?
ArtisanVideos,3diek3,coski,-4,Thu Jul 16 23:50:21 2015 UTC,"Tempering = hardening, annealing is the softening. Some steels self anneal by cooling down to room temp slowly, Others require complicated bakes. In steels requiring complex bakes, the the whole piece is tempered, the edge is coated in a heat-absorbing clay to keep it cool, and then the spine is annealed. This often results in a really cool visual difference between the two parts of steep known as a Hammond"
ArtisanVideos,3diek3,maverickmonk,6,Fri Jul 17 00:10:01 2015 UTC,"Tempering is not the same thing as hardening.  It is a separate step in heat treatment and generally softens the hardened steel while making it tougher (hardness can increase slightly for some alloys with some tempering processes, but this is an exception to the general rule).  The process used to make Japanese-style blades with a hamon is differential hardening, not differential tempering."
ArtisanVideos,3diek3,ColinDavies,5,Fri Jul 17 01:36:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry, got my terms mixed up. Jewelers tend to work in terms of tempering and annealing, knifemakers work in terms of tempering and hardening and I got all fucked up somewhere in there."
ArtisanVideos,3diek3,maverickmonk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:45:32 2015 UTC,"You can also anneal metal, by heating it up and then air-cooling."
ArtisanVideos,3diek3,The_Derpening,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:35:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, except for silver and copper and such which are backwards from steel. Anneal by heating and quenching, harden (to a much lesser degree) by slowly air cooling in ash"
ArtisanVideos,3diek3,maverickmonk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:08:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. What that cooling process does is temper and harden the cutting portion of the knife. If an edge is too hard, it becomes brittle. If it's too soft, it won't hold an edge. The liquid he dips it in, is not water, water would cool the metal too fast and make it brittle. Most likely, it's an oil of some kind. maybe something specific, maybe old motor oil, depends on the individual. The oil cools the metal down slower than water(which would make it brittle) but faster than air(which keeps it soft).  If you do that process to the whole knife, it becomes harder to drill for a handle or scales, it also makes it a pain to grind/sand and finish later. The non-edge portion is better off staying softer."
ArtisanVideos,3diek3,andersaur,3,Thu Jul 16 23:59:16 2015 UTC,"It could change the shape of the knife as well, could it not? if the spine is cooling at a different speed than the edge?"

ArtisanVideos,3diek3,Pottypa,2,Fri Jul 17 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"Yah, that's true.  But there is only a percent or two of those metals in the iron.

ArtisanVideos,3d9v01,talentpun,0,Wed Jul 15 05:29:45 2015 UTC,The amount of smudging depends on the hardness of the brush. I think you might be wrong but I'm no photoshop pro.

ArtisanVideos,3d9nbs,kit_carlisle,3,Wed Jul 15 01:05:12 2015 UTC,I think the obsidian is 'knapped'  (sp?) the same way stone arrow heads are made.
ArtisanVideos,3d9nbs,CharlieEchoMikeDelta,5,Wed Jul 15 01:19:58 2015 UTC,"Pressure flaked, actually; see video #2.  Technically the same process, but instead of striking with a stone, you press very hard into the glass/rock with a point from something hard like antler or metal.  Knapping is just a lot more forceful and generates a different kind of flaking or fracture pattern."

ArtisanVideos,3d9nbs,G3aR,2,Wed Jul 15 02:23:16 2015 UTC,Is obsidian rather durable? It looks like those blades will break very easily. Also are they sharp? At the end of the third video he's holding the entire thing up with bare hands by the blades.
ArtisanVideos,3d9nbs,The_nodfather,3,Wed Jul 15 10:02:25 2015 UTC,"Obsidian is a volcanic glass. If it breaks, it forms very sharp edges.

ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,zapatodefuego,39,Mon Jul 13 18:13:40 2015 UTC,They really did go the extra mile with this one.
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,Passan,24,Mon Jul 13 18:50:48 2015 UTC,I could watch traditional metal work all day. So happy I found this channel.
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,SamIamGreenEggsNoHam,19,Mon Jul 13 19:49:48 2015 UTC,I don't think Man At Arms is a great channel if you're looking for traditional metal work.
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,shaggorama,4,Mon Jul 13 20:48:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't had a chance to look at their other videos yet, are they not at all like this one?"
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,SamIamGreenEggsNoHam,26,Mon Jul 13 20:55:42 2015 UTC,"Some are, but none of their videos so far have been up to this caliber.  If you are specifically looking for metal work check out Niels Provos and Torbjörn Åhman."
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,zapatodefuego,2,Mon Jul 13 21:13:53 2015 UTC,Niels Provos has the added benefit of being an (occasional) redditor.
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,ColinDavies,10,Wed Jul 15 00:48:07 2015 UTC,"they make weapons from video games and movies so, while they incorporate a lot of age old techniques, they are in no sense traditionalists."
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,PM_ME_UR_REDDIT_GOLD,11,Mon Jul 13 21:13:30 2015 UTC,"Nearly all of their videos I've seen they basically just cut the form they're after out of sheet metal then grind it down to sharpen it. They're basically a prop shop.   Case in point, here are the top videos on their channel, all of which are great examples of the process I described:   Jaime Lannister's Sword Oddjob's Hat Finn's Golden Sword   Personally, I rather dislike this channel and don't think their videos fit particularly well with the mission of this sub. But people seem to enjoy them, so I don't remove them."
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,shaggorama,16,Tue Jul 14 03:08:06 2015 UTC,To be fair those are from the old series in the other shop. Most if not all of the reforged series builds are forged blades / like when they forged a billet out of scissors to make a giant scissor blade/.
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,CoolGuy9000,8,Tue Jul 14 04:59:31 2015 UTC,"Both shops are as bad as eachother in terms of forging/cutting ratio. The first shop did the meteor sword which was fully forged, and they did a few damascus swords.  Whatever Ilya ends up working on though is normally an absolute treat"

ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,mr_wafflesoft,9,Mon Jul 13 19:18:27 2015 UTC,"I thought the hybrid builds were neat, but they were really just playing around. You never would have known they were so damn serious about metalworking. Their work gets more technical, and educational, all the time. People still constantly grouse about how Tony, the original Man at Arms guy, is a better blacksmith. That may or may not be the case, but none of his videos showed half this much technique."
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,PM_ME_UR_REDDIT_GOLD,10,Tue Jul 14 02:26:52 2015 UTC,"In the newer videos they seem to have much more appreciation for the original weapons, and talk about the process much more. I'm really loving the direction they are going with the series."
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,mr_wafflesoft,3,Tue Jul 14 02:37:40 2015 UTC,"absolutely. I thought they started out good, but they've gotten much better and are now just about as good as I imagine a 15 minute youtube video of making a replica sword can get!"
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,PM_ME_UR_REDDIT_GOLD,4,Tue Jul 14 02:56:41 2015 UTC,"I think people more or less stopped grousing about Tony being better when the Reforged crew started to do a lot less hybrid builds and a lot more requested builds.  This isn't the only reforged video that i've ever seen that i've thought 'wow, they put in so much more work than Tony's crew would ever do'.  Almost all of Tony's stuff is laser cut from billets of 1075 spring steel and ground into shape.  They always give Ilya a lot of credit during these kinds of builds too."
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,Ace0fSwords,7,Tue Jul 14 07:16:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would say Ilya was a good hire.  I've checked out these guys website and while their stuff is nice, far better than the cheap Chinese crap you see, it is otherwise unspectacular knife show and ren faire stuff (based only on images from their site). Yet here, behind the walls of a company just trying to make a buck selling better-than-average retail blades is a team of people who really care about their craft. It is a pleasure to see how enthusiastic they are to get a chance to spend thousands of dollars just to get a chance to really shine. Watching them get that opportunity is a unique joy, and part of me feels the increase in quality is just us getting the chance to watch them relearn just how much they're capable of when the realities of business are set aside for a shift or two."

These people might be used to making swords but sword polishing, in the japanese way, is an entirely different beast."
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,Gulanga,30,Tue Jul 14 13:13:35 2015 UTC,"no disrespect to these guys, but if your interested in the construction of a katana, I would recommend this video of Japanese master sword smiths who make katanas and traditional Japanese steel for a living.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE_4zHNcieM"
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,cardcarrying-villian,4,Mon Jul 13 23:28:53 2015 UTC,"Great swords, though arguably not ""absolutely, unequivocally the best swords in the world"" great, as is sometimes claimed."
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,Zuggible,4,Tue Jul 14 03:07:51 2015 UTC,"Furthest thing from the truth really. Japanese steel was very poor, and the resulting weapons couldn't really compare to European contemporaries much less weapons that came in later years (the design and construction of the katana pretty much remained static for hundreds of years).      Nor did it really have much (if any) role on the battlefield. The reputation of the Katana pretty much stems entirely from Hollywood. It's certainly a cool sword in terms of construction and ritual, but so much of that stems from having really really low quality metallurgy that they had to adapt around."
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,Aea,2,Tue Jul 14 08:12:01 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting to see how their Katana stands up to one they can make using modern forging techniques (based on hardness, sharpness, edge durability, and possibly blade durability). You have to remember that the traditional japanese swordmaking techiques were designed to make a decent quality sword out of poor-quality iron sand which is why it's so labor intensive compared even to other medieval swordmaking methods (and orders of magnitude more labor intensive than modern techniques). The folding was necessary to purify out all the impurities that don't really exist on modern steel billets.   The real test is whether the stripes of higher carbon steel interspersed with lower carbon steel on the blade edge (the damascus-like stripe pattern caused by folding) gives an advantage over a more uniform blade composition (caused by high purity iron with carbon added), as well as how effective that differential hardening is compared to cast swords that don't use a hard iron/soft iron combination (but instead simply rely on quenching to harden the edge)."
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,Ace0fSwords,2,Wed Jul 15 00:21:18 2015 UTC,"A modern blade could be made strictly superior in terms of performance.  You could design a heat treatment process to get the same distribution of hardness in a monosteel blade that requires welded construction in a traditional blade.  It would cost a lot to set up for a one-off, much more than paying a bladesmith to do it approximately the traditional way.  I guess the real question is if you use better steel, does that let you get away with simpler construction and heat treatment?  I suspect the answer to that is ""yes""."

ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,Dusk_Walker,16,Wed Jul 15 00:36:18 2015 UTC,The curve of a Katana is obtained during the quench of the sword after the clay has been meticulously applied. In this video they mechanical forged the curve into the blade before the quench.
ArtisanVideos,3d5g3o,Injineered,73,Mon Jul 13 20:19:29 2015 UTC,"The final sori is determined by the quench, yes.  The smith can forge in the beginnings of the sori.  A lot of the skill comes from the smith being able to judge how much that sword will curve when quenched depending on geometry, thickness, and specific steel of the blade, as well as the pattern of the clay and the quenching medium used.    They also used oil to quench instead of water, where traditional blades are always quenched in water.  Oil is much safer to quench in, especially when you are working with a clayed blade.  I quenched a Seax that I was making for my father last week in water and cracked the blade during the quench.  I can understand their decision to quench in oil instead and sacrifice those few rockwell points and little bit of tradition to save the countless hours of work they had done at that point.  If I were in their position, I would have made the same choice.    Quenching in oil instead of water, the curvature caused by the quench would be far less pronounced, though still there.  Basically, they did the math on it, and decided that it needed to start curved before the quench to achieve the final sori they wanted.  Much like traditional japanese smiths do and have done."

ArtisanVideos,3d0fu9,brainpostdoc,8,Mon Jul 13 08:47:07 2015 UTC,"Essential tremor:       Essential tremor (ET, also referred to as benign tremor or familial tremor or shaky hand syndrome) is the most common movement disorder; its cause is unknown. It typically involves a tremor of the arms, hands or fingers but sometimes involving the head, vocal cords or other body parts during voluntary movements such as eating and writing.   It is distinct from Parkinson's disease—and often misdiagnosed as such—although some individuals have both conditions.  Essential tremor is commonly described as an action tremor (it intensifies when one tries to use the affected muscles) or postural tremor (present with sustained muscle tone) rather than a resting tremor, such as is seen in Parkinson’s, which is usually not included among its symptoms.

ArtisanVideos,3d0fu9,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:47:26 2015 UTC,do you know if people with such a tremor are less precise? like with drawing and cutting and all? or is it a shakiness that disappears when they put the pen down?  As someone with an extremely still hand this creeps me out. Although it might be because I connect it with alcohol related deterioration :-/

ArtisanVideos,3d0fu9,booszhius,6,Fri Jul 17 13:02:07 2015 UTC,"This is the same sort of comparison between manual board drafting and CADD.  My grandfather was an architect. He would design anything from houses to cathedrals himself, and saw them built. He basically quit when computers came along. He refused to use them because he thought they destroyed the artistry. I think at the time, it did.  Here I am decades later, a designer and drafter by trade and having learned to draft manually before learning how to use drafting software gave me a fuller appreciation of what it took to get a design down on, and how much of a pain revisions were.  I work with a bunch of old-timers who constantly complain about technical issues with software and I have worked guys who would literally scream and smash things to bit on their desk when they got errors or something wasn't ""just so"" in the software, and here I am, anywhere from 10-40 years younger than they are, and I can just laugh, because I can only imagine what their attitude would be like if they had to meet the same deadlines manually.  Any innovation in any field needs to be viewed in the right perspective. People can yearn for the old days when things were ""simpler,"" but sometimes the simpler ways were really painstaking. Among other things, I do not miss having graphite along my oblique arch, from my pinky to wrist (drafting sinistrorsally can be difficult, even with guarding). I do not miss crummy drafting machines that wouldn't hold an angle, chipped scales, diazo duplicators with poor ventilation, and inferior drafting tape. I still despise mechanical pencils.  Appreciate the advances that have been made. Yes, any Post-pananmax Douchebarge can pirate a copy of Photoshop or AutoCAD, but simply having the software with an idea of how to use it does not make them an artist. Artistry takes talent and experience, both of which are easily recognized in the results."

It used to be that all drafts of a part would be created by hand using a lot of the same materials he's using. Everything had to be imagined. Once the design was created, a copy of the draft would be sent to a machinist to be made into a prototype. If the prototype didn't work as expected or didn't fit together in the system, it had to be redesigned, creating a new draft.  We still have a similar cycle today, only we have a lot more design tools. A part is designed in 3D. The 3D model is then put into a 3D assembly to test fit and function. Any design changes can be made on the fly. The 2D drafts are automatically generated from the 3D models (though they usually still have to have dimensions and tolerances added). After all this, the part is sent to a machinist to be made into a prototype. Often, the 3D file can directly be used to create instructions for a CNC machine tool. With all of the additional design tools, there is more confidence that the part is correctly designed from the first prototype.  It's amazing what computers have allowed us to do."

The lines he drew and stencilled, the masks he made, the oh so carefully placed images and text were a child's drawing we cleaned, fixed and aligned. We added the forgotten bleed, increased the weights so they wouldn't blow out, redrew the lines. And the masks, not the ham fisted 'could have been done with scissors' guide on the artwork, no the real masks traced from the scans themselves, the tiniest of details precisely cut from A1 ruby.   Then the complex dance of exposures and diffusion, backwards and forwards across a stack of films for the photographic masks, half a dozen photographic sheets whose exposed areas were overlapped to thousands of an inch precision.  We set the tints, so that this text was that shade, 200dpi dot screens rotated to prevent moire patterns, and with masks and scans perfectly in register across A0 sheets of acrylic we exposed the plates that the machines would print from, one for each colour.

ArtisanVideos,3d0fu9,Rzah,6,Mon Jul 13 03:42:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe, usually I'm pretty chilled, but that guy irked me. Printing used to be a process (npi), that involved a whole host of careers, typesetters were really fucking good at kerning, yes occasionally the designer might cut up the text but that was usually because they had forgot to ask for some punctuation, or the client had insisted on screwing it up, pretty much every block of text was pasted to the layout exactly as it had arrived from the typesetters, when kerning went digital standards dropped dramatically. Scanner operators turned photographic transparencies into screened colour separated sets way better than the cmyk output by Photoshop and the scanners themselves were of infinitely higher resolution and registration than the desktop scanners that replaced them, and then there's the retouching, not airbrushing a photo, but the etching of colour separated film by what I can only describe as a magician. Even the photographers were better, because unless the client was prepared to pay for expensive retouching, the print was going to look exactly like the photo, so it had to be good in the camera.  DTP took all of these skilled tasks and dumped them into the lap of the designers, it was faster and cheaper but holy crap did the quality take a nose dive, and they still forgot the bleed."

ArtisanVideos,3d0fu9,Rzah,2,Mon Jul 13 20:41:32 2015 UTC,"I had some training as a scanner operator, here's what I remember, I'm skipping some of the calibration just to give you an idea of the process and tech.  Our drum scanner was about 10ft long, 5 high and 4 deep, it looked a little like an enormous lathe, basically it was two drums connected by a driven shaft, one drum was under a light proof cover and would hold the film to be exposed while the other was a glass cylinder on which the photographic transparencies would be mounted. Mounting took ages, the operator needed to ensure that everything was spotlessly clean, the transparencies also needed to be wet as any air gap between them and the drum would result in optical artefacts, further they needed to be square with the drum, you can find drum mounting videos on YouTube that go on for 25mins.  Now the film is loaded, it's green light safe, which means that your only source of illumination is a green light, I can tell you the light bulb was about the only thing you could make out in the room so loading the film was essentially performed blind.  Now the machine spins up, in essence what happens is that the machine slides one arm inside the open end of the glass drum while another arm tracks the outside of the drum, there's a laser on one arm and light receptors on the other, as the transparency spins with the drum the light readings are measured, fed through analog circuits for amplification or attenuation and the results used to modify another laser that exposes the film (a bank of dials allowed the operator to adjust the levels in a similar manner to a mixing desk). Four passes are made, for CMYK separations. Now the complicated bit, the separations are comprised of grids of dots, they all have to be at different angles, typically 15 degrees apart so that they don't interfere and produce moire patterns, for high quality print there would be something like 40,000 dots in every square inch, each dot starts circular but as they grow in size for darker areas they become attracted to their neighbours and elongate before flipping at about 60% to become circular holes that shrink down to solid colour. This is all designed around the capabilities of offset litho, which similarly clipped the extremes, screens of less than 5% would often not pick up enough ink to print while a similar effect caused almost solid screens to smear to solid colour. I don't know exactly the process for turning a scanned area of the source into an angled dot on a screen but it was live, there was no memory to store data, scanning and output happened simultaneously, all the moving parts were literally linked together to ensure registration, only the output laser was moved to expose a different area of the film. Registration targets were added to the output, hairline crosses the reprographic planners used to align the films.  A good operator would earn something like £50k ($100k?), in the late 80's, and they all had OCD."

Reprographics was a puzzle, here's a description of what we want, here are the resources, sticking two images next to another, or some text over an image is a thoughtless exercise in DTP but the analog required planning, there were traps to be avoided, you couldn't just charge in and start throwing images about, before anything happened you'd sit down and mentally outline the whole process of turning the line art into final film, and most of those intermediate steps in your head were in negative and back to front.

ArtisanVideos,3d24sg,enginerdz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:43:06 2015 UTC,Each piece has been taken from a different fish. He is grading the quality of the fish to help determine the price. a high grade big tuna can be worth a lot of money.   So the grid is there so they know which piece came from where. So when he says 1 101 that means a grade of 1 for the tuna that had a weight of 101 (not sure on the weight but my assumption would be the weight is in kg)  As to how he determines the grade is what the video is trying to show but it seems to be on of those things that would take soem time to learn.

It varies in quality just like any meat so the good stuff comes from specialty butchers and the best usually gets picked up by deli-type shops that sell it sliced on demand. The cheap supermarket quality legs aren't really as expensive as you'd expect.  A good comparison would be wine. You can get €2 bottles of wine at the supermarket or €100+ bottles at specialty shops.

ArtisanVideos,3d1d7f,Skwee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:43:17 2015 UTC,The hooks are really there to give you something to grip a round log with with. Once you square off the log you can use smaller hooks or other clamping devices. I am more familiar with water powered sawmills than steam powered sawmills but the mechanism is basically similar- some sort of way to cut and some linear motion mechanism to move the stock along. While this model had a fancy 'advance' mechanism there is nothing stopping you from just levering it over and holding it down in the appropriate position with a set of hooks based on the same mechanism as a cant hook. A similar mechanism can be seen here where soon after the 71 second mark you can see them clamp the log down.

ArtisanVideos,3cyat4,MarineLife42,4,Sat Jul 11 21:46:38 2015 UTC,"I really wish there was a tag on this sub for stuff that's very high level. As in, someone who has true mastery of their craft and know exactly what they're doing. As much as I love Frank's videos, he in his videos is the first to admit to improvising and learning as he goes.  I don't really feel the need for another subreddit but I would appreciate a tag that says ""hey this person is an actual master of their field"""
ArtisanVideos,3cyat4,quietAtTheLibrary,16,Sat Jul 11 23:27:08 2015 UTC,I am continually amazed at the new and inventive ways people find to criticize content as not artisan.
ArtisanVideos,3cyat4,searine,3,Sun Jul 12 04:26:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no kidding. I'm so impressed with Frank's work, and if wasn't continuously problem solving, not only would it be boring, it would not feel as authentic."
ArtisanVideos,3cyat4,mgriffioen,16,Sun Jul 12 05:02:35 2015 UTC,Even masters are improvising and learning all the time.
ArtisanVideos,3cyat4,Titus142,8,Sun Jul 12 02:08:06 2015 UTC,Arguably the sign of a true master is the ability to improvise
ArtisanVideos,3cyat4,Jademalo,-2,Sun Jul 12 06:14:41 2015 UTC,"This is the trade off for a subreddit or any sort of small community receiving a large influx of new users. Easily digestible and popular content receives attention because the newer users outnumber the old, while the original guidelines are loosely followed or outright ignored.  ArtisanVideos started off as videos of people showcasing highly refined ability in skilled trade or artistry. People regularly bring up how the standards for ""artisan"" have fallen drastically and they are regularly attacked for it on the basis that they are being a buzzkill or that it doesn't really matter.  They are effectively disregarding that this subreddit is becoming nothing more than a repost ground for DIY, woodworking, fast workers, mass production, and various casual craft hobbies, and if you suggest keeping certain content in their respective subs, you get attacked for it."
ArtisanVideos,3cyat4,Bizor,3,Sun Jul 12 15:10:20 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing though.  If you're really trying to keep it to only people who are true artisans, true masters of a craft or trade, you're limiting yourself to reposts.  Think about how few masters of any skill there are.  It's a tiny fraction of a percent of the people who do it.  And the odds that there's a trove of videos depicting these people doing that craft?  Slim.  Slim indeed."
ArtisanVideos,3cyat4,haewood,-1,Mon Jul 13 16:05:03 2015 UTC,"Not every niche community should expect a ton of content when following such strict guidelines, but it ensures the quality. In the case of ArtisanVideos, quality is being sacrificed for quantity so that people coming here for relevant content have to sift through a ton of vaguely related content and crossposts to find what they're looking for.  I find the common reason for a subreddit being created is to provide content that isn't available in other subreddits. When rules are ignored or changed to appeal to and attract new users, by allowing lesser relevant and more widely appealing content, the subreddit ceases to serve the purpose of a separate community."
ArtisanVideos,3cyat4,Bizor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:48:49 2015 UTC,I think this subreddit exists within a very interesting sphere in which it is a conglomeration of the best certain other creative subreddits have to offer. Certain people continually try and stifle the input of others while providing very little content themselves or providing any example of what the perfect artisan video constitutes. This subreddit will be reduced to a half dozen fiends masturbating over knife videos and japanese woodworking if some people have their way. As it is you may have to search for something you actually enjoy watching but in most cases that does not reduce the claim any other video has to being here.
ArtisanVideos,3cyat4,Yeastextract,0,Mon Jul 13 21:39:55 2015 UTC,"I think this subreddit exists within a very interesting sphere in which it is a conglomeration of the best certain other creative subreddits have to offer.    But that's exactly what I'm arguing that this sub it for, the very best display in a skilled field. I didn't mean to say that I'm against crossposting, I'm against people using this sub as a repost ground for anything remotely related to handicraft that better fits in its own sub.   Certain people continually try and stifle the input of others while providing very little content themselves   This is just a restatement of the platitude ""let's see you do better"".   or providing any example of what the perfect artisan video constitutes.   For sure, it is difficult to assess whether something is ""artisan enough"" because not everyone is an expert. I can say for sure that I don't find this video particularly artisan because of the clear shortcuts and mistakes that Frank addresses, such as the surplus area where the sink is set and the quickly cut out hole for the plumbing.  So yeah, I may not be the best judge of what is artisan, but I can sure see that a majority of stuff being posted isn't appearing at all artisan to me or anyone else that used to regularly come here.   This subreddit will be reduced to a half dozen fiends masturbating over knife videos and japanese woodworking if some people have their way.   If that is the fate of this sub, then come what may. Every sub isn't supposed to appeal to everyone, that why there are different subs, to post things more suited for what people are looking for. Because of the current state of this sub, where blatantly ill fitting content fills the pages, it does not adequately provide for the intended audience. What's the point of having a differently titled community it it provides nothing different?   As it is you may have to search for something you actually enjoy watching but in most cases that does not reduce the claim any other video has to being here.   Having to search for relevant content is just a symptom I brought up. The big issue I have here is that this sub is being repurposed and artisan has lost its relevance. It's not about masters of craft with a lifetime of experience anymore, it's about weekend projects and cooking videos, which already have their own subs.  Again, what's the point of having using different titles if the content is the same?  (and I'm still waiting for someone to call me out for taking something on the internet so seriously)"
ArtisanVideos,3cyat4,Bizor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:44:21 2015 UTC,"Well at the end of the day reddit is a user driven platform, let's see you do better is a valid request. This sub is hardly devolving into anything other then craftmanship and generally at a very good standard, the swathes of new users that some seem to worry about are doing very little to change the general output of this sub. If you want something you will have to provide it, or at the very least vote for it. They are steps by which every sub follows and is created, and indeed by which some flourish. I, like you, would hate to see this sub turned into some third rate diy but that is simply not happening and for every video I dislike I find three im happy to watch and could not find anywhere else. I guess you could point out that this is a case of what I like vs what you like and it is, but in a system where majority rules, then within reason that will always be the case. I can only reccomend that you provide the change you want and if it is received well, or as you believe it should be, then so be it. But if not then you must deal with the compromise you perceive."
ArtisanVideos,3cyat4,Yeastextract,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:57:22 2015 UTC,"That's fair, if in time enough people end up being as fed up with this sub as I am, then so be it.  But if it turns out that I'm just just a vocal minority and the new regulars are content with this sub as it is, that's fine too.  And since I'm not looking to put in the effort to create the community I want, I'll just leave it at that."

ArtisanVideos,3cwrot,nolenn,2,Sun Jul 12 10:21:04 2015 UTC,"Traditionally iconography favored symbolism over naturalism and because of this, iconographic artists would typically follow a set of rules that dictated the composition of an image, the colors used, and the facial features and poses of the subjects depicted.   The kind of iconographic art shown here was most heavily influenced by the Byzantine style of art from Constantinople. Interestingly enough, early christian icons from Rome are depicted with much more realism than byzantine icons, despite predating them for some years. Hope this helped answer your question!"

It's also easy to find ones where the person featured knows what they are doing and does something more than a simple intro project. It's hard to find those things combined.   I've never heard of or seen that knurling-like thing he did on the surface of the outer ring. I'm having trouble even visualizing what the important variables are in getting that right--it's non-trivial, since you have to make sure you end up with an integer number of bumps at each radius.  Probably it's a common clockmaking thing and he used a calculator."
ArtisanVideos,3cu1hy,BillyTheClub,2,Sat Jul 11 10:08:39 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure that the only requirement is that the angle that he moves the ring each time is an even division of a full revolution.

Make brass: naw fuckem, massive coin your way for all those who don't givashit or dunno; people across the globe love your OZ softspoken. Clickspring: aww yeah, point taken mate ;D - crossed fingers (I already have been paid shit tonnes in my neck o' since my voice kicks ass. I worked hard on this voice, and found a niche were I could exploit it. :( since I couldn't get a proper talent job in the regional major market.) Make brass: yeah you should be re-compensated for how awesome you are, given your voice over talents. Clickspring: yea, you are right. But, shouldn't I still do the voiceover (and machine work, HA HA) on the clickspring channel so that the guy who hired me for clickspring (I mean me...) can still post and make money since that ""collaboration"" made me. Make brass: naw, fuckem......... We'll have this company who is paying one ore more people/bots to regularly post to gaming/hipster channels under the subscriber name /u/jooes to post your new Make channel voiceover video to ArtisanVideos, so that WE can make the percentage on those views.

Make marketing: We have gotten away from our grass roots heritage, lets create a niche YouTube channel and then leverage the interest and talent from that created channel to drive traffic to Make. Make brass: I'm listening, what kind of channel do you have in mind? Make marketing: Well, machine shop type videos are trending like cu-ra-zy, but we got to go hipster. How about brass machining, you know like for brass clocks. That won't alienate our viewership (since its brass instead of rebel steel) Make brass: We'll green light that... Make marketing1: Alright let's get a man who can machine brass and another non-female person who is softspoken to do the voiceover. Make marketing2: why softspoken?

Your work surface was the problem though. It wasn't rigid, so every time you put your hand on it, it gave way a little.

ArtisanVideos,3cov76,fourdahg,3,Fri Jul 10 01:54:32 2015 UTC,"Very nice work, but there's one thing here that Struzan does a little better, which is the sense of competeness. Not to say that it was bad, far from it. But the thing about Stuzan is that he makes every single piece of the poster feel 100% as important as any other. Max liked great, Imperator was good, and the rest was a little bit of an afterthought. Another Struzan thing is that he never leaves backgrounds to just be white. He's great at finding a suitable way to make the image glow.   Still, great work."
ArtisanVideos,3cov76,window360,2,Thu Jul 9 20:25:51 2015 UTC,"Lovely word choice. I was going to mention as well that Imperator looked far too yellow compared to the rest of the image, making her almost seem like the only important character, and Max isn't as covered in light which makes him seem a piece of the background. Lacks balance. But it's an amazing image, so I don't want to come off like it is a bad drawing, far from it."

ArtisanVideos,3cosab,ninepound,7,Thu Jul 9 18:04:25 2015 UTC,"So as a guitarist who does a whole lot of looping as well as messes quite a bit with pedals, I am pretty sure that quite a bit of this is just plain prerecorded with the guitarist playing a select few parts.

ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,fiplefip,8,Wed Jul 8 01:10:23 2015 UTC,"What is that rolling thing he uses to, I'm assuming, square the edges?"
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,Gubrial,3,Tue Jul 7 22:51:29 2015 UTC,it's a cutting gauge.  http://www.rockler.com/rockler-wheel-marking-gauge  It's used to create a precise mark that is paralell to the edge of the piece.
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,_mach,2,Wed Jul 8 02:14:33 2015 UTC,It's pretty damned useful. Much more precise than trying to mark things with a ruler.

ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,tupac_is_still_alive,4,Wed Jul 8 08:20:44 2015 UTC,I'd make a keychain out of the tool he uses to pop the secret box out
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,adltmstr,3,Wed Jul 8 14:11:24 2015 UTC,I'd make a weed pipe out of that tool.
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,the_colon_poweler,3,Wed Jul 8 01:56:33 2015 UTC,Does anyone what kind of oil it was that he rubbed on the box at the end?    It had almonds on it so I'm thinking some kind of almond oil.... extra points for anyone who could link to the exact brand.
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,Bubblegoose403,11,Wed Jul 8 07:45:15 2015 UTC,I made this video. Here's the finish I used. http://youtu.be/5abtwsk3T6Q
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,the_colon_poweler,3,Wed Jul 8 06:10:27 2015 UTC,Awesome and THANK YOU!  Great video and artistry!
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,kula_shakur,3,Wed Jul 8 15:32:03 2015 UTC,It looked homemade. That was an actual almonds container. There was some writing on the side - probably a recipe for whatever that was. Some guys mix waxes and/or oils. Probably impossible to say unless he told you.
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,Refracted,3,Wed Jul 8 18:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, probably something like beeswax/linseed oil. There was likely wax anyway as he passed his heat gun over it to melt it in properly."
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,_aex,5,Wed Jul 8 09:08:48 2015 UTC,I adore the format of this video.
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,gdstudios,3,Wed Jul 8 11:29:25 2015 UTC,Did he seriously put the finish on with his bare hands?  What the living fuck
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,Bubblegoose403,7,Wed Jul 8 13:15:07 2015 UTC,Yeah its beeswax and mineral oil.  Mineral oil is used to treat minor skin irritations and beeswax is beeswax.
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,colossus3200,6,Thu Jul 9 05:40:21 2015 UTC,"It's food safe, he makes it himself. He posted a link to a video on how to make the finish up in the thread a little ways."
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,bondfool,3,Fri Jul 10 14:39:25 2015 UTC,I've never seen a glue bottle like that before. What's the purpose of its design?
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,Bubblegoose403,4,Fri Jul 10 05:59:07 2015 UTC,It's called a GluBot from Fastcap. You have better control over the flow of glue and you don't have to turn the bottle upside to get the glue flowing. It's fairly inexpensive and allows me to buy my glue in bulk.

I will readily admit, I'm not always super safe around my blades, especially if I'm making something I am very sure about, but there is no way I'd put up a video of it.   Edit- Got through the first part. The rest of it was awesome. But damn, that first part.. BTW, none of that takes away from how cool that freaking box is."

ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,djetaine,7,Tue Jul 7 21:58:46 2015 UTC,"LOL. It's important. As I said, I don't always adhere, but if you are going to put something out on the net for other people to see and possibly follow, you should definitely set an example."
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,counters14,7,Tue Jul 7 22:04:46 2015 UTC,"When you are putting up videos for general consumption, and meant to appeal to a wide audience you need to think about that shit. Not just what people are going to think about your technique and lack of safety, but the fact that it is such a bad example for others who may not know better.  The reason people talk about it is because it NEEDS to be talked about. Shop safety is not a fucking joke, and is something that everyone should take seriously."
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,kula_shakur,2,Tue Jul 7 22:10:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know man. I work in the glass business and we do things that other people freak out about. It's not nearly as dangerous for me as it is for an amateur but some stuff we do looks insane. If i'm having a teaching moment with a new hire, sure, I'm going to be extra careful and do everything by the book. If I'm making a FREE entertainment video for public, at-will consumption? Doubtful.   This guy has zero obligation to make what he does look safe. That is a perk of being a professional. Especially if you're crossing into art - your obligation is to your creativity. Period.   Keep in mind, there are a million jobs that have some element of danger involved. Many of those jobs also have some level of finesse.  People ride bulls, wrangle alligators, climb tall trees, you name it. No one would expect an amateur to watch a tight-rope walker do some dangerous shit, then jump up there and attempt it. That's called being an idiot and there's no one who can help them.   This dude is not pushing the wood through with his feet or running the band saw with his eyes closed. He's being safe for his level of expertise and that's all he's required to do."

ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,counters14,2,Wed Jul 8 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"It isn't about following directions, it is about proper procedure and precaution that goes beyond what you learn from a shitty little booklet that was translated from Chinese into twenty different languages, which is what any first time hobbyist with zero experience would probably be dealing with.  Safety isn't something to toy with. If you're going to fly off the handle about what you incorrectly deem to be useless comments about safety then I don't really have much else to say about the subject, I'm not aure we can see eye to eye on the matter.  Well not much else except please take some time and effort to learning proper safety techniques and operate power tools with respect. I might not be very pleased with how this conversation worked out but that doesn't mean I want you to lose a finger or worse."
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,counters14,4,Wed Jul 8 09:25:23 2015 UTC,Thanks for the white knighting.   What are you talking about? What is going on here? .. Am I having a stroke?
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,dclctcd,2,Wed Jul 8 15:53:11 2015 UTC,"Many gun enthusiasts are equally tedious and self-righteous with safety rules even though every other gun enthusiast has known them since he/she was 8. God forbid if the guy making the video doesn't check that there isn't a round in the chamber on camera regardless of the fact that he did it twice right before he started recording. I'm not a gun enthusiast and I live in a country where I'm not likely to ever get to hold a loaded gun, yet I've encountered so many of these parrots that I'm more likely to dream about them than about my last girlfriend."
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,Tonamel,3,Wed Jul 8 01:41:16 2015 UTC,"If you look at around 3:45, he uses other things to push the wood through. He should basically be doing something similar every time, instead of putting his hands incredibly close to an active saw blade. Fingers and table saws don't get along, and should be kept as far apart as possible at all times. There are push sticks made for specifically this purpose, and he doesn't seem to have any."
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,counters14,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:01:11 2015 UTC,"He used push sticks to rip some of the pieces through on the tablesaw against the guide. I don't understand why he wouldn't use them every time, don't ask me.  This guy seems to have a very arbitrary approach to safety, and that is scary. The guys who don't take safety measures seriously are the ones who usually have the biggest accidents. If they already know better, there is zero excuse."
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,paulmakesthings,3,Wed Jul 8 02:14:17 2015 UTC,his fingers are not close enough to the blade. you want your fingertips to brush lightly against the blade as you pass the wood through to insure your wood ends up a nice deep red color.
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,djetaine,3,Wed Jul 8 02:33:59 2015 UTC,"In the first few cuts on the table saw he should really be using another scrap piece as a guide/fence, not his fingers. His left hand is way too close to the blade, same for the bandsaw."
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,iamzombus,5,Wed Jul 8 04:03:33 2015 UTC,"What did he do wrong?  He was using a sled, feather board, push sticks."
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,djetaine,5,Tue Jul 7 22:47:26 2015 UTC,"I was only talking about the very first part of the video with this hands super close to the blade. Further along he was a lot more careful, that's why I edited."
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,iamzombus,3,Wed Jul 8 00:18:55 2015 UTC,I guess the only sketchy part I saw could have been his use of the band saw.
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,Bubblegoose403,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:20:49 2015 UTC,Please keep in mind that everything is sped up at least 2x and most of the cuts are 4x and some of the camera angles make it look worst than it is. It's on a sled and I'm holding the piece in place firmly. I have a respect for the table saw and have never even come close to having and incident. Anyone commenting on bandsaw safety knows nothing about bandsaws.
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,djetaine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:11:44 2015 UTC,You are definitely right. I think it was mostly the angle that made it look like you were much closer than you were. I meant no disrespect to your craftsmanship so please don't take my comments as such.
ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,Bubblegoose403,2,Tue Jul 7 22:12:25 2015 UTC,Not at all. I appreciate both the concern for my safety and the general reaction to my videos/projects. Cheers!

ArtisanVideos,3cgppx,wolv,2,Tue Jul 7 22:18:00 2015 UTC,"He's using a crosscut sled. That's about as safe as it gets without clamping it to the sled. Resawing the block on the bandsaw without a fence made me a little nervous, but bandsaws are quite a bit less unpredictable."

Not just how well he knows Python but that he can talk so well and program at the same time.  That said, why is he using emacs if isn't going to use any of the power? Single key backspaces through a whole line? Doesn't even have syntax-highlighting on??"
ArtisanVideos,3ccx00,AwwYea,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:34:59 2015 UTC,"~20m and I have no idea why this is taking so much code. Is it no longer standard behavior to accept a socket connection and fork()? That gives you the separate process and takes like 3 lines...  Edit: Oh, because you might need them to be the same process? (Although it sounds like the GIL nixes that idea.) At least he's doing a select()."
ArtisanVideos,3ccx00,Doctor_Sportello,0,Tue Jul 7 00:58:32 2015 UTC,"He discusses how the multiprocess module results in similar overhead to that of the threading module, which can be cost prohibitive for workloads like his bad fib example.  I don't know if fork() would result in the same overhead."
ArtisanVideos,3ccx00,AwwYea,3,Tue Jul 7 01:03:32 2015 UTC,"Well, it's cost-prohibitive because of the high overhead relative to computing fib(1) but that's a completely bogus way to test (as he says). Instead, you could put some guard in there to compute it ""locally"" if it's below a certain value, fork()ing otherwise. Or better yet, rely on the fact that basically nobody is going to request fib(1) (via the server interface) and don't worry about it. However, that helps both his and my idea, so it can be factored out.  Really, I object to the weird socket class that does that coroutine thing, plus the task manager. He mentioned the threads are (normally) handled by the OS, so why write your own mini-OS to handle processes? Just fork() and let an expert task manager figure scheduling out.  I still think this belongs here because I'm sure he could answer these questions. It just seems odd to me to avoid mentioning The Standard Way To Do This.  Oh yeah and there's no reason I can think of to have them in the same process if you used some IPC mechanism. For fib(), shared memory with a cached set of return values would help a LOT."
ArtisanVideos,3ccx00,julius_censor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:23:59 2015 UTC,"For someone like me who only has esoteric knowledge of programming, it's really cool to see that he can write ""his own mini-OS to handle processes"" with python.

ArtisanVideos,3ccx00,MrKino,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:02:41 2015 UTC,"Off-topic, but your comment has me slightly confused. Is esoteric the right word to use here? Wouldn't that imply that programming is a fairly intimate subject to you, and you wouldn't have to rely on vocal cues, etc?"

ArtisanVideos,3ccx00,cdk_aegir,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:57:59 2015 UTC,"I believe his talk is a great performance and shows deep knowledge.  A fork for every request is definitely not The Standard Way. It is way to expensive. It could also easily be abused in a security context. I don't know any real world servers that would do something like that. They all use a pool of reusable processes, if they use multiple processes at all.  And scheduling is the task to give processor time to processes. He does nothing like that in his talk.   Instead, I think, it is more about sync (blocking) vs async. And how python is used to make blocking calls non-blocking and allow the OS  scheduler to do his work better."

""Taisho"" in this case is this word, which Google translate gives as ""general, admiral, boss"". It's also a title given to sushi chefs.

Simple etiquette in Japan. Even after being told this, you'd be surprised how some guests would bite their sushi in half with the other side spilling out of their mouth onto their plate and the table, chew with their mouth open, and make a big fuss. It never looked pretty, I guess, so it was a house rule we had that my Japanese chef said is the proper etiquette, unless it is a child or old person who cannot handle a whole piece at once."

The fact that you can get huge slices of fish in a sushi restaurant is quite american. There's a reason this is a traditional art form. The perfect sushi bite is an art form. But for better or worse, we've got all kinds of sushi joints out there, and some of them trade on value, which means more meat for the buck. Sometimes I like a two bite sushi, mostly, it makes me feel sick when there isn't that perfect balance of fish and rice.  edit: sometimes you get so much excess fish that you can turn it into a sashimi bite. In that case, it's kinda cool. But still, I end up having to ply it off like a cave dweller. My point I guess is that the art of sushi is very much lost unless you go to that rare restaurant."

(Temperature does indeed have a lot to do with it)  For me, mixing the ginger was my favorite part of eating sushi, since it added a lot of flavor to it, and man do I love that ginger, always asked for extra. But after trying ""expensive"" sushi, I get why you eat the ginger separate since it will actually overpower the delicate flavors of the sushi.  Now if I'm having regular $8 lunch sushi, you bet I'm going to add the ginger AND mix the wasabi with the soy sauce."

ArtisanVideos,3caj0h,Lytalm,0,Mon Jul 6 23:21:27 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I agree with you. Food is not objective, it's subjective. I happen to have a dull palate (and I have to stick my face right up to food before I can smell it) while my wife is a supertaster. Guess what? We eat the same food differently.   Watching this video, I absolutely agree that the chef is a master and the food looks delicious and I wish I was there. But 'stop shaking the soy sauce off the fish]', 'never have ginger with the sushi'? What if I LIKE that? I am EXTREMELY opposed to tradition for tradition's sake. Maybe eating ginger in the same bite as sushi ruins the sushi for this chef. What if it enhances it for me? There's no way for him to know that. I could go on, but most people do not share this opinion and so it's very difficult to get it across."
ArtisanVideos,3caj0h,orbit222,10,Mon Jul 6 17:49:00 2015 UTC,"I understand your views, but at a world class restaurant with one of the best chefs, I would probably take their advice haha. It's like anything where someone knows more than me, I'd like to do it the proper way.  It's like having a good coffee; adding tons of sugar might taste good, but it wont taste much different than a crappy coffee with the same amount of sugar. Now that I have good quality beans at my house, I drink coffee black and it really brings out the undertones and flavours of the coffee much better. Same thing with ginger/sushi, all you'll taste is the ginger and it really wont matter at that point if you are eating $5 sushi or $500 sushi so it's kinda disrespectful to the chef, and sorta yourself, to eat it like that.  Sure you CAN order and eat a $100 fillet minon well done, but expect to be ridiculed lol."
ArtisanVideos,3caj0h,saient,7,Mon Jul 6 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"Food is not objective, it's subjective.   It's both? Flavor is subjective, cooking is a craft. Some places (most restaurants) you're going for flavor, and some places you're going for the craft.  Let's take the ginger for example: if you're eating ginger with your sushi, you're inherently overriding the taste of the fish and rice with the ginger (simply because ginger is a powerful odorant with strong texture, too). That could taste better to you, but then you're not tasting the dish the chef intended for you.   You could not care about that stuff, or be unable to taste it, or anything that results in something tasting much better to you with a nice slice of ginger on top - but that's not the craft. I agree: if you're getting sushi from Albertson's or some joint with bigass tempura rolls, etc, go ahead and eat it how you want. They're just trying to get that shit off the shelves and into your mouth. The places, though, where people pride themselves on their work, are trying to get you to taste their craftsmanship.   You can buy a thrift-store painting and do whatever you want to it, but you don't go into an art gallery with a can of paint and ""fix"" what you don't like. That said, if you don't like it, you can just say you don't like it and go somewhere else. So you don't have a palate for sushi? So what. Maybe those people all worked up about sushi couldn't tell you the first thing about chocolate or music, etc."
ArtisanVideos,3caj0h,Seifuu,-3,Mon Jul 6 19:08:14 2015 UTC,"It just doesn't sit well with me. I hear what you're saying, and again I understand that I'm in the minority and what you're saying makes sense, but what if I get dragged to a 'craftsman's restaurant' for a birthday dinner or some such occasion? Surely I can absolutely admire the work the chefs put into the dish, from plating to searing to presentation to whatever, but what if I try one bite the intended way and then one bite the 'wrong' way and I like the 'wrong' way better? Am I a bad eater? Should I eat the rest of the dish I paid for in a way that pleases me less than another perfectly fine way that's right in front of me?  As I type this, Led Zeppelin came on my shuffle. Jimmy Page surely spent countless hours mixing and mastering Led Zeppelin IV, both when it was released and whenever they did remasters. Should he get annoyed if I turn up/down the bass/treble to my liking? My ears are different than his, even if his align more with the majority of listeners.  So there may be an objectively 'best' way to cook or prepare a meal, or a way to cook a meal that pleases the majority of people (and can therefore be called 'best'), but simply put, if I like food a way the chef didn't intend, I'm paying for it in the end. Would the chef rather I left thinking ""it was artfully done, but in my mouth it was just pretty good and didn't quite hit the mark - to me, needed some salt, or something"" or would he rather I left thinking ""it was artfully done, and with a small dash of salt was amazing! Would recommend 9/10, 10/10 with rice."""
ArtisanVideos,3caj0h,orbit222,5,Mon Jul 6 22:24:34 2015 UTC,"It's tough, because I know what you're saying. Everybody's different and thus for a piece of work to come out how it's meant to be, it has to be tweaked for everyone. The issue is that people might know what they like and don't like, but they rarely identify the why correctly. You might think a dish needs more salt, but really you're sensitive to the tomatoes, overpowering the parsley and making the dish seem bland. By adding salt you dull the zest of the onions and, while you like the dish better, you've just turned an A+ salsa into a B- gazpacho. Sure, you might like the gazpacho more, but it doesn't fit with the rest of the course, etc etc  I getcha. It's a fair complaint. I would hate to get pulled out to a fancy restaurant on my birthday, because that's supposed to be my day of comfort and now I'm forced to pay attention to some guy's interpretation of a salmon fillet when I really just want a large order of McDonald's fries (so limp and delicious...). Ultimately, that decision and knowledge rests with you. How well do you think you understand the intent of the author and how well do you think you are adjusting things for your own sensibilities vs retreating to a point of comfort? How important is your comfort versus your appreciation in this circumstance?  You're going to get downvoted on this sub because, as an artisan-focused sub, there is a belief in the paramount importance of artisanship. Sometimes, like in this video, You're not paying for the ingredients on your plate, you're paying for the experience. It's like, you don't bring a boombox to a live concert. Not just because somebody'll probably punch your lights out, but because you paid to see the band perform their music.   In any case, a lot of actually nice places are really accommodating about that kinda stuff. Really artisan-focused places often consider the user experience a part of the craft. They'll do stuff like find out your favorite food and tailor your dishes appropriately. For less obscure examples, there are upscale sushi places where you can sit at the bar and the chef will change what he serves you based on your reaction to each dish.   So, if you don't like a dish at a really nice place, it's often better to just tell the staff. Gordon Ramsay has a series called Best Restaurant where he sends people to purposely be really picky about food to test this exact phenomenon - most of these places will adjust or even replace an entire dish just so it provides you with a good experience. At chain or low-end restaurants, it's better to just add salt or ketchup, though, unless you think your dish is missing just a little spit."

It is generally a process of moving parts wearing against each other to produce the last small bit of size and shape adjustment that will settle them into a stable relationship for the rest of their working life.  One of the most common examples of break-in is engine break-in for petrol engines and diesel engines.

ArtisanVideos,3c51n5,Rylock,64,Sat Jul 4 21:57:29 2015 UTC,Yes. Good quality fresh meat can be eaten raw.
ArtisanVideos,3c51n5,IWantToBeAProducer,9,Sat Jul 4 22:15:31 2015 UTC,"To be a little more specific, meat always has bacteria in it, even when the animal is still alive. When it dies the immune system shuts down and that benign balance of non harmful bacteria becomes susceptible to foreign invaders.   Generally speaking, that harmful bacteria is introduced when the meat is being processed and handled. That means it's mostly on the outside surface of the meat. Refrigeration slows down the spread. For all these reasons, you typically only need to sear the outside to make it safe to eat.   This is also why ground beef is more dangerous than steak. The grinder takes all that bacteria on the exterior of the meat and mixes it all into the middle. So you probably don't want to eat ground beef rare if it came from a normal store. However, if you grind fresh steak that has been handled well, you can eat it rare."

It is often served with onions, capers and seasonings (the latter typically incorporating fresh ground pepper and Worcestershire sauce), sometimes with a raw egg yolk, and often on rye bread. The name tartare is sometimes generalized to other raw meat or fish dishes.  Although less common than the completely raw variety, there is a version served in France of steak tartare called tartare aller-retour.

ArtisanVideos,3c51n5,Mr_Smartypants,26,Sun Jul 5 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"Steak, no, since all the bacteria is on the outside.  Searing it and leaving the inside rare/raw makes it safe.

ArtisanVideos,3c51n5,ghostsarememories,2,Sun Jul 5 06:42:55 2015 UTC,I though the same thing until I had chicken tataki in a small izakaya in rural Japan. Seared rare chicken breast with onions and soy and vinegar. Absolutely delicious with no food poisoning.
ArtisanVideos,3c51n5,DatNiggaDaz,4,Sun Jul 5 13:39:52 2015 UTC,"The difficulty is not intrinsic to chicken, it's the industrial scale raising techniques (which have a very high population density) and industrial scale butchering techniques which tend to result in an increased likelihood of disease transmission (in live birds) and cross contamination (during the processing).  With low density raising and low density butchering, the risks are significantly reduced.  Duck breasts are nearly always served rare or medium but they do not tend to be raised in the quantities or density of chickens."
ArtisanVideos,3c51n5,maybehelp244,3,Sun Jul 5 14:54:10 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. This place raised and processed their own chickens. The tataki was great, but it took 6 months before I would try it."

Chicken has a chance of having Salmonella and pork has a chance of having Trichinosis.  Both of which can give you a really bad time.  Beef though, so long as it's from a trusted source, is totally fine to eat raw.  That's what steak tartare is."
ArtisanVideos,3c51n5,ZeroAccess,2,Sun Jul 5 14:05:47 2015 UTC,Trichinosis from pork is extremely rare these days. In the past it was more of a problem and it's a stigma that has carried on. It's very common to serve pork cooked medium or medium rare in restaurants now.

ArtisanVideos,3c51n5,Danthekilla,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:16:17 2015 UTC,"Steak tartare:       Steak tartare is a meat dish made from finely chopped or minced raw beef.   It is often served with onions, capers and seasonings (the latter typically incorporating fresh ground pepper and Worcestershire sauce), sometimes with a raw egg yolk, and often on rye bread. The name tartare is sometimes generalized to other raw meat or fish dishes.  Although less common than the completely raw variety, there is a version served in France of steak tartare called tartare aller-retour. It is a mound of mostly raw steak tartare that is lightly seared on one side of the patty.    Image i     Relevant: Yukhoe | Çiğ köfte | Crudos   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

ArtisanVideos,3c51n5,a_redditor,2,Sun Jul 5 01:08:37 2015 UTC,"Different meats have to be handled differently due to the way possible pathogens interact with them. Chicken and pork have to be thoroughly cooked because salmonella can get into the meat of the chicken and uncooked pork can lead to trichinosis if the animal had be parasitized at any point in its life. They're both completely safe to eat when cooked through. Beef, on the other hand, only needs to be cooked on the outside as there are no pathogens that can make their way into the meat itself. It's also not a common breeding ground for any particularly nasty bacteria like e. coli or salmonella unless it was exposed during transit or preparation."

The older clips from the time when the father was still alive was from an episode of another one of NHK's programs, Begin Japanology.  (If you like documentaries and are interested in learning more about Japan, this series is great.)  It's unfortunate to hear he passed away but good to see that the Takarai brothers are keeping the business going.  The video didn't mention the plans of closing the Tsukiji fish market sometime in 2016 and relocating it about a mile and a half away to Toyosu.  The new facility would have have its benefits in terms of space, sanitation, temperature-controlled rooms, and parking, but I know that there has been large resistance to the relocation.

ArtisanVideos,3c3z5i,SirSmokesAlott,31,Sat Jul 4 17:44:59 2015 UTC,I would tend to agree. In broadcast where millions see the design (film is the same. Same designers) we absolutely cannot work this way. The client sees the effort put into a project and reacts appropriately. Any client who wants it in one day has A: no vision and B: no budget. The two go hand in hand even with mainstream graphic design projects.   This guy is the dollar value menu of graphic design. He might be really good but we will never know because he doesn't choose to self evaluate his work. Second guessing is a good thing people.

In general, I think it's a bit worrisome that there are so many videos out there now that value quickly making something that's passable. (e.g. Watch this guy make a beautiful landscape in 5 min!) I do think that's a product of this generation's vine-minded era that wants everything in a gif...okay, I digress, I'm sounding like Clint Eastwood's character from Gran Torino, back to my point.   For an example in the video he says:   With the quick deadlines, I have no choice.   But I really do think a part of the reason why he has those quick deadlines is because he set himself up to be that sort of business. He probably is known by his colleagues as the the guy who can create 10 logos in 10 days. (Just an example).   I do understand his logic, that giving yourself a short time to create things forces one to make quick decisions, and in turn makes him more confident in his abilities. But on the other hand I don't enjoy how he criticizes the method of taking time to create something as a process that avails itself to ""Stupid decisions and stupid mistakes"".  I understand what he's saying but I disagree. I believe you can create something in a short amount of time and create something professional, a lot of people do that, including this guy. Being professional by simple definition is about being paid to do work or not. But if one defines their work as being good enough, because it is good enough to get paid for, nobody is ever going to create masterpieces that will be revered across time and culture.  A chapel can simply be a room with a cross. But it takes three years of painting a ceiling that creates the Sistine Chapel's ceiling."
ArtisanVideos,3c3z5i,fiplefip,6,Sat Jul 4 16:00:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, I sort of see both sides of the argument here in terms of work method.   But I really do think a part of the reason why he has those quick deadlines is because he set himself up to be that sort of business.   Absolutely. I tend to do the same thing because I've found that I work best under pressure. As he said, it forces me to make decisions and to really focus in on what I'm doing in an effort to execute quickly.    But I do agree that my best work has been stuff I was able to iterate on over time. Give me 2 months to do a project I can rip through in 2 weeks if you put me under pressure, and you'll probably get something more refined, but not all that much better. Give me 2 weeks to do a sprint and get something out, then give me 2-3 weeks away from it, followed by another 2 week sprint, and the progress made will be much more noticeable."
ArtisanVideos,3c3z5i,kanuckdesigner,3,Sat Jul 4 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"You've hit the nail on the head.  Short time to create rounds of logos are good. Then after a series of short rounds, you have a good selection to work which fits the needs of the client best. Then give yourself short rounds to come up with evolutions and so forth.  Edit: Also second guessing your work is the foundation of design. You need to think if it meets the criteria properly. Otherwise it's art, not design. And it doesn't necessarily help the client.

And also criticizing that he made it in one day. I don't see it that way. I'm a student of graphical design and at early stage of my career, I see problems the guy is facing a lot and I admire him made such a logo in the given condition. I know that in this subreddit people like to see old techniques where someone is dedicated for a long time to make a product. In today's world this really hard to do in graphic design. You simply don't have enough time, it's hard to get to the position where you can actually be the authority for the client and some people usually never get to it. Now you have freelance sites like 99design where design is treated like consumer shit, customer can chose between 100 designs, chose one and pay it 100 bucks. No in that environment you don't have time. You alse have similar problem when more serious customers like big companies like Wacom, Sony, BBC are look for some design to be done, they will make paper saying we need this and that and send it to the 10 design studios, who do the better job get the money. Ideology of this guy comes from this reason. On the other hand this guy have to work with client. Yes you have to sell your design, how people will see your work have a lot to do with first representation and contexts you are putting your work in. Selling your design is part of designers profession. So if you are showing someone logo on computer screen that have to be printed on a T-shirt you have to make really good presentation. For non designers it's really hard to feel the design from screen to final product. Also logo just for it self doesn't mean a lot, it is part of a bigger picture - brand, and this whole thing is going to make perception for customers if logo works good or not.  So at the end look at final product, don't focus only at the process. Did he made technically good design? Yes Is this logo visually appealing? Yes, although this question is personal opinion, and it is hard to get objective answer (you would need study with 200 participants, few groups, professional study...) Is the design good for the website where it will mainly be used for? Yes, it's in that hipsterish mood and it goes well with modern Instagram photographs client is selling. Did he menage to impress client? Yes  I don't say this is the best design ever, or that it could be done better (it always can). But I'm saying that in this conditions this guy did a great job."

It is highly competitive out there, but doing spec work or promising tight deadlines to win out over other designers is what's devaluing graphic design.  But I don't buy the idea of a self imposed one day limit on a design project because that's really limiting your ability to conceptualize new ideas for a project. The biggest issue I see is seeing your designs with fresh eyes the next day or so, which I think is really important to separate yourself from the initial attachment to an idea. He did an okay logo in a day, but if you're designing something you should really try to make a great logo and not force yourself to settle with whatever you have at the end of the day."

But most people will tell you the way to get the most out of your coffee is the prep. I could probably make a folgers taste decent and a craft bean taste bad. Honestly what makes most standard coffees taste mediocre is the prep (drip coffee brewed too hot with the wrong ratio).
ArtisanVideos,3c2inj,RyanThePhotog,3,Sat Jul 4 20:10:40 2015 UTC,"As a coffee drinker, nope. If you are drinking a heavily diluted coffee, which is something I do since I'm not a lover of the coffee taste all that much, then really it's just about what you're diluting it with rather than how much work goes into the preparation of the beans. If you are drinking lattes or mochas you can pretty much use any beans as long as you're diluting with milk or sauces that you like."

ArtisanVideos,3c2inj,bvillebill,2,Sat Jul 4 15:07:50 2015 UTC,"If you have a more plain coffee, ie espresso, americano or a drip coffee, it's much easier to tell the difference. When you put a ton of milk, sweeteners etc they mask the taste of coffee.   Of course you need to drink coffee for a while to tell the difference either way though."
ArtisanVideos,3c2inj,Tru3Gamer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:09:32 2015 UTC,The there is pretty big difference between fresh roasted coffee and what you could buy at a grocery store. The oils in coffee break down pretty fast so you get more flavor and aroma from fresh coffee.  Although you usually let roasted coffee rest for about a day before drinking it.
ArtisanVideos,3c2inj,AnthonyMaybe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:05:12 2015 UTC,"It depends. Not everyone has a super-sensitive palate. Not everyone has perfect pitch. Taste is super-subjective. Coffee, like wine or cheese, has become a luxury product. That means that a metric butt-ton of cultural baggage has been piled up around it. So, this beautifully shot and edited video, is really just showing off a lot of presentation. Plenty of third-wave coffee shops make a killing off of theatrics, because the most sensitive taste buds are dead center between our ears and behind our eyeballs. That's how you get someone to pay $7 for hot, dirty water with milk. I fucking love coffee, and am very critical of my espresso. However, I spent over a year as a barista, in a very good coffee house and roaster. I pulled, served, and drank thousands of shots of espresso and pour-overs. I wouldn't have developed a picky taste for this stuff otherwise, in all likelihood."

By habit, I want to add stuff to it (like creamer), but it's so easy to overdue because it doesn't put up the same level of fight as other brew methods. I often end up drinking it black.  Crazy thing, I'd been noticing that my coffee smelled really sweet when I let the last little bit dry up in my mug. I assumed it was my creamer or whatever. Until I got the same result from a mug that had only coffee in it. I'm gonna have to try with hot brew to see if I get the same result, but I kinda suspect I won't.  My next experiment is gonna be flavored cold brew (I use a bag method based on large coffee filters that I can staple closed, so it's just a matter of adding extra ingredients beyond just grounds). I'm gonna make a jar of vanilla+spice (going for a sort of chai coffee effect), and a jar of orange+ginger.

ArtisanVideos,3byvjy,CunderscoreF,41,Fri Jul 3 09:19:03 2015 UTC,Why? Some people want good content and aren't interested in the higher up politics of this site.
ArtisanVideos,3byvjy,pizzasoup,28,Fri Jul 3 17:43:17 2015 UTC,"I have never really had an issue with reddit, it's done what I want it to. Now this person whom I have never heard of gets fired, and I can't see anything. How do people know she wasn't fired for the correct reason?"
ArtisanVideos,3byvjy,BelievesItsNotButter,12,Fri Jul 3 10:51:55 2015 UTC,"I see your point and I definitely know what you mean. Maybe she did something tremendously bad for the company. Maybe the awful AMA with pastor-dude really was the straw that broke the horse's back.  The problem lies in how the admins handled it. When they cut /u/chooter out of the picture, they didn't warn anyone, and they didn't have anyone lined up to take her place. Which is bad, because she handles coordination, verification and dictation for a lot of AMAs, which are core to a lot of subreddits. They run a service platform dependent on volunteer moderators to keep it afloat, but it seems like lately they're just doing what they want to and expecting mods to adapt.  But at the end of the day Reddit is as Reddit does. The admin team has to make (sometimes tough) decisions for the company and I completely respect that."
ArtisanVideos,3byvjy,pizzasoup,11,Fri Jul 3 11:54:39 2015 UTC,"This is the argument I don't get. I have never been at a job where I was forewarned that someone was going to get fired. Why would they go out and say, ""hey just so you know, in a few days, so and so is going to be fired... But don't say anything."" Shy is everyone expecting Reddit to let other admins and mods know that she was going to be fired?"
ArtisanVideos,3byvjy,fairly_quiet,10,Fri Jul 3 13:21:09 2015 UTC,"They didn't have a replacement system in place. When she was let go, all of the AMAs that were set for the day and for the foreseeable future were left flapping in the wind, and the mods of all subreddits that had AMAs planned had no means to contact any of the interviewees, since Victoria was their point of contact. She offered to stay on and help sort things out during the rest of the day, but she was ordered to be hands-off. The subreddits were screwed."
ArtisanVideos,3byvjy,CLG_DONEZO,3,Fri Jul 3 15:24:03 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like the subreddits need to get their shit together.  If everything falls apart when someone you have no control over is out of the picture, then you clearly had a pretty shitty system to begin with. Reddit is a platform. It's not their job to run individual sub-communities."
ArtisanVideos,3byvjy,RndmHiroZero,2,Fri Jul 3 16:05:43 2015 UTC,"It was their job to coordinate the AMAs; that's why they paid Victoria money to do that as her full-time position. However, the administration fired her without locating a replacement, and that one's on them."
ArtisanVideos,3byvjy,ageofthoughts,2,Sat Jul 4 01:06:33 2015 UTC,"coming from a completely mathematical angle - failing to plan is planning to fail.  it appears that a good number of large subreddits had all their AMA eggs in one person's basket.  and staying mathematical, this pushes back the AMA's about one day.  there will be some hassle with rescheduling but the format won't collapse because of one person leaving.  and if something would collapse if one person left then that one person should be asking for six figures."
ArtisanVideos,3byvjy,Damaso87,0,Sat Jul 4 01:10:37 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Feels like the subs should take a good portion of the fault for not having adequate plans

The blackouts are there to show that any sub, no matter how large or how small, is fed up with the administrations lack of communication and poor handling of the site. It doesn't matter if we don't care about the politics of the higher ups who manage this site as a whole, their decisions and actions affect all subs. That includes this one.  That being said, I get why you wouldn't want this sub to do it, it would just be annoying to the general user base.

Then Digg decided to abandon it's users, to implement a new format and a new system, which did not support many of the APIs that Digg users were using. They basically said ""Fuck you"" to their entire userbase.    And that it what propelled us onto Reddit.  An open site, which valued its users, and their contributions above all else.

People missing content are more likely to do something, like protest the admins and all that hullabaloo. Providing content and leaving the sub open is kind of placating those on the fence about the whole ordeal. It makes it less likely for something to be done.   However the subs going dark haven't stated what they want done, it's basically a whole big mess of ""WAH I DONT LIKE THIS"".   I think the whole thing smells rotten. This is the second time we got a harsh decision that the community heavily disagreed with, while giving no information or context from the admin level.

ArtisanVideos,3bxq0e,DigiAirship,4,Fri Jul 3 12:30:39 2015 UTC,Forgive my ignorance but is this like Garrys Mod but better? Does it take the same level of skill to use? I know nothing about this kind of thing.
ArtisanVideos,3bxq0e,EpikYummeh,22,Fri Jul 3 03:45:08 2015 UTC,"Unreal 4 is a game engine, which is basically the core which games are built around. It is used to determine the game physics, lighting, effects, etc. Normally, a engine is barebones and you have to create all the art assets yourself, like the models for trees and objects, and the textures that make the models actually look like what they're supposed to look like, but Unreal 4 ships with a ton of prefabricated assets built into the engine itself, so you can download it and do stuff like this with it.  As for the comparison to Garrys mod, I haven't used either, but I would assume no."
ArtisanVideos,3bxq0e,BR3AKR,13,Fri Jul 3 04:02:27 2015 UTC,"Garry's Mod is a building game. Unreal Engine 4 is for building games. If you wanted to create an RPG game, you could write the game for Unreal 4, and design the game world in this application."
ArtisanVideos,3bxq0e,Shadax,6,Fri Jul 3 04:08:57 2015 UTC,"It's an application used for developing games. It includes the ability to script events that can occur, and placing assets (like the ones you saw the artist use to create the scene you saw). You can build an entire game from the ground up with an engine like that, for instance recreating garry's mod (Garry's Mod was created using the Source engine which is comparable to the Unreal engine you're viewing here). As far as skill level, the tool is developed to be as easy as they could figure out how to design it. But because the application has so much power there are many many many tools at your disposal, all of which take time to learn it can feel overwhelming. Like any craft worth learning, it would take time and patience. Creating a scene like the one you saw? I'm sure you could do it, I believe (someone correct me if I'm wrong) the assets used in that scene are included by default with the tool so you wouldn't even have to go about creating the 3D models. Hope that helps!"

This a quality setting for near realtime rendering of movies etc... Or realtime rendering for small scenes if you have a very powerful gpu.  That is not the quality level that games are actually made in. Turning it onto ""game"" mode changes the way lighting works, the way the camera works and a few other things, which result in it looking visually the same as unity.  So basically unreal is visually superior until to try to make a game with it, then they are at about the same level.

The people I know that do this professionally (in board repair) typically run max heat with heavy flux, but it does take a lot of practice to avoid bridges…"

Check out the PRC 2000-2M from PACE.  Extra flux is like extra soap when doing dishes. You might think half a bottle made them cleaner but you have to clean up more bubbles and a mess you didn't need to make. Tinning pins, leads, through holes, wires or whatever is sufficient. However, most nice soldering jobs come from prep work. A few come from having the right equipment, and the rest from experience."

ArtisanVideos,3bsbhk,BaconOverKarma,9,Thu Jul 2 06:21:43 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I was listening to Noam Chomsky say something about the matter today, when he was talking about Google. He said that in the future, it's going to be about what information you are able to find and how you can use that. Everyone's going to be able to use the internet but many people are just going to use it to look at music videos or fail videos or whatever. The vast majority of people are going to be terrible at finding the right sort of information and terrible at putting it together.  I am guessing we are slightly better off when we are looking at men actually doing skilled work. It could inspire us to take on a hobby and even start a small enterprise. So I think you can easily say with pride ""yes it is"", because it could probably be much much worse."
ArtisanVideos,3bsbhk,0_-,5,Thu Jul 2 07:12:12 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of people are going to be terrible at finding the right sort of information and terrible at putting it together.   Knowing how, what and where to find information is a skill all in itself. Google Fu is a thing.  Anyone can do it, it just takes a level of understanding of how the system works and how to get what you want out of it. Push button, receive bacon."
ArtisanVideos,3bsbhk,Miserygut,2,Thu Jul 2 10:50:27 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, definitely. You could make an entire job out of just being able to sit in front of Google.com and knowing how to actually use it. It sounds a bit ridiculous but then its important to remember that the actual Google site is incredibly minimalist and contains no leads. All of the information is in the user's head. The user needs to know the sites to search. Furthermore, site search is one of the most powerful functions of Google by far. The user needs to know which sites to search. It ends up being like a forest, where a person knows all the hidden paths and rabbit trails in order to get around. The average person is hopelessly lost, the veteran knows all the paths and gets around with ease. This is perhaps one of the ultimate abilities of the modern age, and it is almost exclusively not utilized by the lower and middle class. They go there and type ""sex"" or ""basketball"". They would never in their wildest dreams go and type ""site:www.gutenberg.org nietzsche hard bed"", to give an incredibly specific example. You could use Google to search for Philosophy or for things that would directly contribute to the GDP as we know it. But these people are not being taught it in school, and for good reason.   It is really incredible that people are walking out of school not knowing these things. I could justify in my mind an entire period in school dedicated to knowing internet services, mainly Google, out of 5 school periods per day. It's more useful than math in high school."
ArtisanVideos,3bsbhk,0_-,2,Thu Jul 2 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that most people made an attempt at using the internet in the way youve described. As you've seen, people eventually stop trying to search for obscure information and IMO, it's a vocabulary issue.  You have to know what inputs the search engine will need to direct it toward the topic at hand. Most people can find basic information but ask them to find instructions on how to solder a chip like this and they won't even know where to start. Even if they know ""solder"" and chip are key words, they don't have flux and package (as in chip package) in their vocabulary so their search efforts won't result in the kind of sources that would teach them the importance of those words. Repeated failure to find anything complex trains them to stop using internet searches for everything."
ArtisanVideos,3bsbhk,0_-,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:00:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is one of the first things I do when I am researching a topic. To recognize all the vocabulary and take note of it. First there is a certain measure of depth in the research, such as how far does the rabbit hole go. So for example I want to book a flight soon and am researching that, and I have found that there are people who are talking about ways of getting really insanely low prices on flights by avoiding fuel costs, but at that point everything goes private and hidden and they start using slang to try and protect the good deals they get. There is nothing illegal about this, it just goes to show the sort of knowledge that is legally available. And it could potentially save hundreds of dollars on a flight (or alternatively, waste many hours of one's time). But there is absolutely no way the average person would know about this unless they did a sort of depth test into the subject. And actually a search engine would be completely useless for this, a reddit search was performed in order to find a casual IAMA where a user talked about this.   So actually, even with the correct vocabulary, the average internet user is barred from accessing a lot of very powerful information. Search engines are actually a bit of a marketing platform more than anything, the first link is often Wikipedia, but then certainly after that there will be a page that has the goal of making money, more so now than ever. And lastly, the information on those pages is almost guaranteed never to be controversial or provocative. Which in some cases means if money is involved, you're paying the highest price, or at the very least you are only gaining the knowledge that everyone has easy access to, which gives you comparatively little specialization or leverage to perform some very unique functions.  All of this in mind, a person struggling with the basic vocabulary of the subject is just basically screwed. My heart goes out to them because especially in North America, this is no longer the sort of economy where you can ""go out and do your job"". People are very simple in that regard, but the world is rapidly becoming very complicated, intellectual and information based. I fear many people are going to get thrown under the bus, despite their hard work ethic."

He can make a repair alright, but it's not pretty. In my mind, artisan means they can make it functional AND pretty.  I was cringing hard when he was trying to use tweezers to pick up a couple of copper traces. That's how you make a repair into a bigger repair...  He also doesn't have the right iron tip for drag soldering. This is the tip designed for dragging: https://blog.adafruit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1248_ORIG1-600x461.jpg  Still, what he did works, so I won't fault him for that."

WHY WOULD YOU PUT SOMETHING YOU PLAN ON INGESTING NEXT TO A MACHINE THAT MELTS LEAD???  this alone should be an example of dangerous working conditions.

Hold your hand half way at arms length and kind of point your finger inward. Now close one eye while looking at where the finger tip is.

ArtisanVideos,3bm2xj,Khanstant,-9,Sun Jul 5 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"edit: I mistook these orbs for the lame ones they sell to emulate this type of performance. My new comment regarding this video is that I did not enjoy the performance, which is fine."
ArtisanVideos,3bm2xj,dei2anged,8,Tue Jun 30 16:28:45 2015 UTC,It was this guy's video's that the son of the guy that had a go marketing contact juggling found and made him think he could successfully sell people the idea that his substandard product would do all the work for you.  The props that he is using are as much a consumer product as a set of wood carving chisels are.
ArtisanVideos,3bm2xj,Khanstant,0,Tue Jun 30 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"Those are mere glass spheres, not the goober product sold to goobs everywhere? If that is the case, I am the one with egg on my face, the egg faced goober of the day."
ArtisanVideos,3bm2xj,Mysta02,2,Tue Jun 30 17:09:41 2015 UTC,"Just clarification but both the Fushigi ball AND professional quality contact juggling balls are still just acrylic balls. The Fushigi has a smaller, silly looking metal ball inside that kind of ruins the whole effect imho.   However, people mentioning the scene from Labyrinth with Michael Moschen. That man actually used glass balls. Which is insane, because a 4"" acrylic ball (like in this video) already weighs a pound a half. That's insanity to me, because glass must weigh a whole hell of a lot more."
ArtisanVideos,3bm2xj,eNonsense,2,Tue Jun 30 19:43:00 2015 UTC,"Well wait, so the glass balls are still glass inside of glass?"
ArtisanVideos,3bm2xj,dei2anged,6,Tue Jun 30 22:48:07 2015 UTC,"Contact juggling can be done with any sort of ball. The ball used in this video is just a standard 4 inch clear acrylic ball. The Fushigi ball was a clear acrylic 2.75"" clear acrylic ball with a polished metal ball in the center.  Fushigi as a product got a lot of scorn in the juggling community as it took a skill that takes hours of practice and wrapped it up in an infomercial that made it sound like you could have it figured out for $20.   Imagine a commercial telling you that for only $20 you could unlock the secrets of Bullshitigi, a mystical art lost to the ages. The video shows master artisans blacksmithing badass Damascus steel swords, doing back flips, and impressing women. What do you get for $20? A hammer and links to YouTube blacksmithing tutorials.   Now imagine your a blacksmith and hearing someone say that ""meh, anyone who drops twenty bucks can learn that""  :P"

ArtisanVideos,3bm2xj,speaks_with_his_fist,0,Tue Jun 30 18:05:03 2015 UTC,"I'm upvoting you back to one because this is a rather important subject with any art. This sub allows performance arts to be classified as artisan, and this is a performance. Whether you like it or not doesn't matter, it is an art form.  I'll admit I don't much care for contact juggling, it's neat but it doesn't entertain me very long. The showmanship was the only reason I watched this video, and I always try things I don't enjoy just to see if it's because it was because I saw a bad example. Also, curious to see how it'd be received here.  However I will admit this is an art. It's not the materials that matter here, he could be doing it with wooden sphere or especially round fruits. What matters is the performance. This isn't a routine he got from a guidebook or tutorial, or else he wouldn't have been as good as adapting. This is his own performance. You wouldn't say that a guitar player isn't artisan because he bought his guitar and used it to play music, would you?  Then again, it might just be that you disagree with performances being allowed here. If that's the case, I'd join you in that sentiment, but we're in the minority."
ArtisanVideos,3bm2xj,ThirdPoliceman,-3,Tue Jun 30 17:05:39 2015 UTC,"I do not agree at all that performance should be disallowed, honestly, the only form of art I look down on is photography, and that's just because I'm an asshole, no logical reasoning behind it. Performance is one of the oldest arts, not knocking it at all. I wasn't into this specific performance, but I believe I also misunderstood the device he using. I thought it was those things that made this trivial, from the replies I'm getting, I think it might actually be just a normal glass ball which is easily 15% more impressive."

ArtisanVideos,3bll18,LegendaryOutlaw,10,Tue Jun 30 11:50:16 2015 UTC,"He often knows Spielberg's films better than Spielberg himself.   When he was composing for Jaws, Spielberg wanted something artsy, high-brow, and melodic for the shark's music. Williams told him ""What you don't have here is The L-Shaped Room (a high-brow character drama)...you have made yourself a popcorn movie.""  And, bingo. Williams was right. And we get probably the two most iconic notes in cinema score, and indeed possibly popular music, history which have become musical shorthand for ""ominous"". E and F.  What would a lesser composer have done with Jurassic Park? Probably given us a violent, angry, high-tension, pulse-pounding thriller or overly-dramatic action score.   Williams knew who 90% of JP's audience was going to be. Not people looking to get scared, or thrilled. Not people looking for gore and terror.  No.   It was gonna be kids, and kids-at-heart, who were looking to see real, live dinosaurs for the first time. Or at least the next best thing. These people weren't going to see the T-Rex as the baddie. Or, possibly, even the raptors.

ArtisanVideos,3bjnj5,Solsed,6,Tue Jun 30 05:27:24 2015 UTC,The new isn't discolored by years of UV exposure. Also the best varnishes don't age as poorly and are easier to remove.
ArtisanVideos,3bjnj5,Apodeictic974,3,Tue Jun 30 05:41:12 2015 UTC,"The new one hadn't yellowed with age, and because it's thinner it won't yellow as quickly as the old one.

ArtisanVideos,3bkc4g,Itssosnowy,-9,Thu Jul 2 04:59:15 2015 UTC,im pretty sure a sword is significantly weaker when you dont add any folds to the billet and when you grind the edges down as opposed to actually forging it.
ArtisanVideos,3bkc4g,cre_ate_eve,9,Mon Jun 29 23:24:25 2015 UTC,"Wrong.   The only reason ancient swordsmiths folded metal was to create uniformity of material that they could not achieve  otherwise. Todays steel is much better and it already at the required uniformity.   Next, they did forge the edges down to near their final form. Then they ground it from there. All blades are made this way. Sword and knives are not forged to a razor edge. They are brought roughly to the desured shape then ground the rest of the way. This used to take days or weeks. Now it can be done in a workday."
ArtisanVideos,3bkc4g,ataraxic89,-1,Tue Jun 30 03:15:48 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNuEDtnVdeM uniformity huh? god damned you are fucking utterly ignorant.  are you twelve?
ArtisanVideos,3bkc4g,cre_ate_eve,-12,Tue Jul 14 13:16:16 2015 UTC,"the way you forge and fold metal arranges the crystaline structure in a way that adds dynamic strength.  And when you forge the edge to a point as opposed to grinding it creates a micro structure in the blade by tightening the bonds at the edge more than in the body of the blade, keeping the body more flexible while making the cutting edge harder and more able to hold an edge.  you do not want uniformity in the structure of a battle blade.  you fucking moron  words  *yes. downvote cold hard facts. go ahead. it wont make you any less completely fucking ignorant"
ArtisanVideos,3bkc4g,cre_ate_eve,6,Tue Jun 30 04:12:06 2015 UTC,And I guess the quenching and forging is just for fun aye.
ArtisanVideos,3bkc4g,ataraxic89,-12,Tue Jun 30 04:16:08 2015 UTC,"i didnt say there werent two ways to skin a cat.  You mean the method Japanese use? they apply mud to the area of the blade when quenching when they want part of the blade to remain more flexible while the other remains hard.  they do not quench the whole blade evenly because as i said, for the best battle blade you absolutely do not want a  uniform structure. A method which these hobbyists still were not doing properly for best results.   fucking moron"
ArtisanVideos,3bkc4g,cre_ate_eve,3,Tue Jun 30 04:34:28 2015 UTC,So you mean that you want a soft edge and a hard edge on a double edge sword? You want to take that in battle?  I a double edge sword you want to have an uniform structure due to the shape of the sword.
ArtisanVideos,3bkc4g,freerider,2,Tue Jun 30 08:41:10 2015 UTC,"Despite his demeanor,  he's actually correct on this particular facet. Tools,  which a sword was back in the day, were often made with different grades of metals for the edge vs the body. You can see this very clearly in axes and scythes, where harder steel is forge welded into cheaper, softer metals, with the hard steel forming the cutting edge. Back in the day,  this would save many man hours,  and required less skilled work,  so you could have apprentices making the rough blanks,  and the business end handled by the journeymen and master smiths.  Also reduced cost,  since the cheaper low grade metal made up the bulk. A sword made purely of high quality steel was only affordable by the extremely wealthy aristocracy."
ArtisanVideos,3bkc4g,NiteTiger,0,Tue Jun 30 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"no, hard edges soft center, so the blade holds a sharp edge but the sword has overall flex still. you are thinking of symetry.   symetry and uniformity are completely different. yess you want both edges to have the same structure but you dont want the spine of your blade to be as hard as your cutting edge  *words"

ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,fusiformgyrus,6,Mon Jun 29 06:05:22 2015 UTC,I was mostly amazed by the kimchi fridges that they had in the documentary. The only reason why I'm not making kimchi is that I cannot finish it on my own even though I eat a lot.   How long does it stay fresh in the fridge? Can I make a big batch and then freeze it?
ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,cmanfire,5,Mon Jun 29 14:26:29 2015 UTC,"Since Kimchi is fermented, it is never really ""fresh"", unless you like it that way and eat it right after making it. Kimchi can last a few weeks easily when purchased at korean stores. Even then, the stores that make their kimchi ferment it for a little bit before selling it. So it can last awhile depending if you like the texture to be crunchy, or softer.  Personally I would not freeze it. I accidentally done that in my fridge and it ruined the kimchi."
ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,first_five-eighth,7,Mon Jun 29 14:54:56 2015 UTC,"Freezing makes the water in the cabbage expand, which ruptures the tissues and makes it mushy once it thaws."

But it is something completely different in Korean culture - this was a great documentary showing how deeply ingrained Kimchi is not only as a dish making an appearance at every meal, but also how its production is a centre ppoint of Korean communities and families. Oh, and the documentary shows us that moms are moms everywhere."
ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,Northofnoob,3,Mon Jun 29 19:58:41 2015 UTC,You germans would like kimchi it's not too far off from Sauerkraut!
ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,L4NGOS,2,Thu Jul 2 04:47:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I do like it. For most of my compatriots, it is far too hot, though. They are also not used to the high amount of garlic and would be reluctant eating it when they have to meet someone later on, because garlic breath carries a stigma in Germany. Maybe the milder variant prepared by monks could be successful. Oh, and Sauerkraut is very different from Kimchi, and yet also fantastic - esp. if heated several times. Yummmmm."
ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,hanj82,8,Thu Jul 2 18:16:17 2015 UTC,"the fermented anchovy was a bit much for me. Oh well, they probably would think the same about putine."
ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,L4NGOS,16,Mon Jun 29 04:51:17 2015 UTC,"The anchovy isn't used in all kimchi, in the southern parts of South Korea they tend to have more fish sauce and anchovy in their kimchi and in the north they tend to have less, in reality everyone has their own recipe. If you go to a restaurant in Seoul the kimchi they serve rarely contains any fish or fishy flavor at all. Personally I prefer the non-fishy version."
ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,Kraz_I,6,Mon Jun 29 05:36:48 2015 UTC,"Coming from busan, both taste great, honestly. Our family prefers more aged cabbage kimchi, which tends to be juicier than the lesser aged ones."
ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,first_five-eighth,2,Mon Jun 29 08:24:25 2015 UTC,"I generally don't like the ""fish"" taste so that makes me prefer certain types of kimchi, I agree with you though, older is better I believe. I've only had 3 year old kimchi though, I guess there could be an upper limit."
ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,Kraz_I,7,Mon Jun 29 08:48:47 2015 UTC,"If you've ever been to a Thai restaurant, you've probably had fermented anchovies without even realizing it. Most Thai dishes have fish sauce for seasoning, and fish sauce is made from fermented fish, usually anchovy."

ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,visionist,8,Mon Jun 29 04:26:18 2015 UTC,"If you don't think about what might or might not be in it, and just allow yourself to experience the flavour and profile it's not too bad. There is ~1000 varieties of Kimchi, and most families will have a specific recipe they use for their own kimjang (making Kimchi), so it rarely gets boring.  It also helps that a typical Korean meal is usually built around a main serving of rice & soup, and a bunch of different side dishes (banchan). The banchan are usually really strongly flavoured, so Kimchi fits right in.  I've eaten the stuff nearly everyday, most days multiple times, for the last 3 years."
ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,zedsmith,8,Mon Jun 29 05:31:11 2015 UTC,"I can attest to this. My mother is Korean, so I grew up eating a combination of American and Korean food. As an (unfortunate?) side effect, I find many foods to be quite bland and boring, and have always been attracted to fermented and extremely strongly-flavored foods. I regularly eat foods that make most people pinch their noses."

ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,revlisaerok,10,Mon Jun 29 06:08:29 2015 UTC,"I assume its kind of a ""you get used to it"" thing. Most people don't like coffee at first but like it after they get used to it, if someone who has never heard of it before(as unlikely as that is) tasted it they would likely wonder why so many drink it. Likewise to many kimchi probably tastes gross but to the south korean people they've been eating it all their lives so they enjoy it."
ArtisanVideos,3bgo5u,xkcdfanboy,11,Mon Jun 29 04:53:53 2015 UTC,"Tried kimchi fried rice? Definitely a great way to spread a strong flavor across a bland food uniformly.   Personally, I am now craving like 6 different kinds of kimchi."

You can usually avoid this by forcing mono audio in whatever video editing / recording software you're using. It's a shame that you can't fix this from within youtube. It also helps to do your sound editing with headphones so that it's easier to detect an error than with speakers.

ArtisanVideos,3blb99,HeirOfVahagn,34,Tue Jun 30 03:42:03 2015 UTC,Am i alone in thinking that classifying people playing video games as artisan is ridiculous?
ArtisanVideos,3blb99,Elmepo,11,Tue Jun 30 03:54:30 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. For a game like this yes. Dishonored is hardly crazy difficult stealth wise. Not easy by any means, but it's not exactly hard to clear the entire game without getting spotted, and while the video is flashy, it wouldn't have taken them too long to figure out.  But on the other hand, I'd definitely say that the stuff a lot of pro fighting game players do is artisanal, such as Evo Moment 37 or this video where a pro Dota 2 player details how to play a specific character against another in depth. I'd even go so far as to say that this video, where another pro Dota 2 player details his thought process as he played the grand final games of a multi-million dollar tournament, is artisanal.  The difference between those videos and OP's, is that the ones I posted involved absolutely crazy amounts of skill. Here's a breakdown of EVO Moment 37. That's a crazy amount of skill that's being displayed by Daigo, and it's something that almost no one would be able to replicate without putting some very serious effort into it.  Likewise, Blitz (The Storm Spirit guide) mentions he's climbing back up in MMR from 5500. MMR is effectively a gauge of a players skill in DOTA, and while the statistics are hidden, most best guesses put 4k players at around the top 10 percent of all DOTA players. 5.5 to 6k would probably be in the top 5 to 2.5 percent of all players in DOTA 2.  It's very much a case by case basis in my opinion."

ArtisanVideos,3bbdl1,THE_HUMAN_TREE,3,Sun Jun 28 13:20:35 2015 UTC,How does the stirring work?
ArtisanVideos,3bbdl1,Chojiki,7,Sat Jun 27 21:40:31 2015 UTC,"A small Teflon-coated magnetic pill is dropped into the solution. In some hotplates, another larger magnet is located within in the hotplate itself. This magnet rotates and causes the magnetic pill to rotate along with it. This is a much better way of stirring things than using glass rods or trying to create something that can seal but also rotate if you need to work in a contained environment.  Teflon is used because it doesn't react with very many things. There are also some stir bars that are coated with glass if reactivity is a problem."
ArtisanVideos,3bbdl1,goldragon,2,Sun Jun 28 02:58:51 2015 UTC,"The one thing I remember from my college chemistry class lab is the TA pulverizing some Total cereal, mixing it with water, and putting in a beaker with some water and one of those magnetic stirring pills and set it to stirring.  When she pulled the pill a few minutes later it was covered with a fuzz of iron shavings.  She did this to show that while the cereal did contain the RDA of iron, it was in a metallic form that our bodies could never absorb.  Those bastards at the cereal company know this but don't care.  If you need more iron in your diet then you should cook with cast iron and slightly acidic foods will react with the iron to form molecules your body can actually absorb and use."
ArtisanVideos,3bbdl1,munificent,4,Sun Jun 28 00:44:44 2015 UTC,"She did this to show that while the cereal did contain the RDA of iron, it was in a metallic form that our bodies could never absorb. Those bastards at the cereal company know this but don't care.   Your TA made up a villainous story. Nutritional iron comes in two forms: heme and nonheme. The former we only get from eating meat containing red blood cells (hence the name). It is easier for us to absorb. (You can think of the animal whose meat we're eating as having done some of the work for us already.)  But we can and certainly do absorb non-heme iron as well. Most of our iron intake comes from non-heme sources, and it's particulary easier to absorb in the presence of vitamin C, which Total cereal is also fortified with."

ArtisanVideos,3bbdl1,Roeyalflush,4,Mon Jun 29 05:37:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the Hydrobromic Acid consists of hydrogen bromide (HBr) dissolved in water. since the hydrogen bromide gets regenerated during the process and can enter the cycle again, it is a catalyst."
ArtisanVideos,3bbdl1,Roeyalflush,2,Sun Jun 28 02:59:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, sure. He should have said that he used HBr as a catalyst.  He could also add pure water and a more concentrated solution of hydrobromic acid, since that is what he distills off at the end. That would make it a little more clear.  The reaction is 4 H2O + S -> H2SO4 + 3 H2  So it is made from Sulfur and Water with the help of HBr as a catalyst.  Interesting Process, nonetheless."

ArtisanVideos,3ba51o,ReasonReader,4,Sat Jun 27 10:06:58 2015 UTC,"Some of the communities around the Great Lakes of Africa region use bellows made of wood with sheep skin. Sticks are attached to the skins and moved repeatedly in an up-down motion, one in each hand. It is extremely arduous and can take up to 10 hours to complete a smelt.  The tribe I am familiar with drinks banana beer and sings nuptial songs to ensure the fertility of the furnace, to which they transfer feminine qualities. The history of iron technology in Africa is fascinating stuff."

ArtisanVideos,3ba51o,strippingworrior,7,Sat Jun 27 08:09:47 2015 UTC,The narrator wasn't really doing that. I could piece together some of the french and it wasn't a particularly tight translation.

You don't want to expend more energy than you are consuming as calories. A dug earth shelter. while great for a stable long term situation, is not the best choice for a survival situation. There are a lot of temporary shelters that are very easy to build with minimal tools and that work extremely efficiently.    Also important to remember that the goal in a survival situation is to be rescued. So staying put in one place long enough to dig out a shelter, expending huge amounts of energy and risking being buried alive is not the best choice."

At first, I was considering what it would take to get a significant adjustment mid-cut, and the only thing I could think of was a jig on a router attachment and a long ass router bit.  Then I saw he was only adjusting 7 degrees over the course of 9 whole feet, which is only .06 degrees per inch or (7/108), meaning the edge of the blade is coming out some [12""blade]= (12 sin 7)=1.46 inches total on a 12-inch blade over the entire distance or (12 sin 7)/(9'*12""/')=.0135 inches per inch, which isn't a lot given that a full kerf blade is about 1/8"" or .125"" thick, a full magnitude 10 larger than the difference change per inch.  This math is super lazy and doesn't take analytical methods of the placement of the teeth on the blade, but you'd still end up with something on the ORDER of about a magnitude 10, which to me is significant enough not to have to do a full-on free body.  As that 'danger zone' increases, be it with a larger blade, a thinner kerf or a more aggressive angle per traveled foot, you'd need to adjust one or more of the other two parameters to keep it in balance, or you'd get some torsional kick-back."

ArtisanVideos,3b1mb3,AV3NG3R00,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:44:14 2015 UTC,"With regards to the shuddering:  The shuddering is a result in the backlash of the gears in each joint's gearbox - yes, even with worm gears - and maybe a little bit as a result of him using steppers instead of continuous motors. I actually think the stability this arm achieves is amazing considering its price point. It's possible that a better control approach might improve the shuddering marginally, but honestly I don't think it'd be worthwhile pursuing. It'd have to be such a complex implementation - i.e. taking into account the mass/CoM of the payload and the orientation/state of the arm - and wouldn't be worth the likely insignificant improvement.  There's a reason that professional industrial arms use super high reduction, near-zero backlash harmonic drives: it is the most reliable and effective way to reduce shuddering/improve repeatability."

As it turns out, it doesn't actually matter that much what kind of horn you use.  A conical horn gives a perfectly smooth projection of sound coming from the bore, so as long as you're in front of it, it always sounds the same volume.  An exponential curve is louder to the front, but it amplifies all frequencies the same amount.  A french curve is a tool to plot euler's spiral, which probably isn't that bad as far as curves go.  Horns basically give the speaker more air to push on.  By keeping the air confined in a tube, you give it fewer places to go, and you can get some real push into it, and use that mass of air to move a bigger mass of air, etc. etc."

He is disappointed not by the industrial scale of the cigar industry, but rather at the loss of the understanding of what makes a cigar good. Not great, not perfect, just a damn good one. This pretty much can be applied across the board for all artisanal videos. We're losing something in the craft of products because of the people who are making them, and not by the speed or amount they produce them at.  tl;dr Cuban Cigar making man dropping subtle artisanal philosophy bombs."

ArtisanVideos,3avp5u,sidious911,5,Wed Jun 24 04:13:33 2015 UTC,What I love about this guy is that he doesn't just tell and show you the steps necessary to make a cigar. He breaks the steps down and explains WHY it's done a certain way. The why is so much more interesting than the how. I'd love to see a series where they find someone who is as articulate and passionate about their craft and walks you through their process.

The transition from the ""pimped-out"" car for the interior camera movement to the ""normal"" car for the outside shots was flawless...at 3:29, the ""internal"" camera tracks and ""exits"" the front passenger door to the external shot...beautifully done."
ArtisanVideos,3arnyr,0xD153A53,4,Tue Jun 23 18:28:01 2015 UTC,"The ping pong ball was CG, I think largely because they didn't want to dump a take if they made it a practical effect and the actors missed!"

ArtisanVideos,3arnyr,17934658793495046509,6,Tue Jun 23 03:16:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of the technical dimensions of film-making and to see innovation like this just gives me instant wood.  The results were absolutely phenomenal.  However, the problem with innovation like this is that any other director that reuses the technique ends up having to deal with the ""We saw that in Children of Men...meh"" attitude from some of us technical nerds.  It's like the bullet-time animation from the Matrix; it looked great, worked well, but for anyone else using the technique in the future, it will simply look like the technique was poached.    Sometimes innovation can only look great once, and I think it's important that such innovation isn't wasted.  Imagine if that scene from Children of Men looked AMAZING, but the rest of the film was shit...the innovation would've been completely wasted on a mediocre film.  Thankfully, that wasn't the case and the use of the tools in this regard did a great job to help Children of Men be technically, as well as artisitically, fantastic."

ArtisanVideos,3arnyr,PongSentry,7,Tue Jun 23 05:30:02 2015 UTC,Now I am wondering how they achieved the end of that scene. Where the camera exits the car and you see it drove away. They must have used a hidden cut or some quality vfx.
ArtisanVideos,3arnyr,TheDonkeyWheel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:24:51 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly.  I was looking for the transition from the rigged car for the internals to the normal car for externals...VERY well done...

But most of the ones you mentioned I can do or atleast understand how to do (probably not as pristine as them). But I can't imagine them actually painting our the car rig and replacing it in post. The only other option is a hidden cut, that I haven't been able to catch. I just want to know how they actually did it.    (I haven't watch the scene in question in a while, so I may be hazy with my memory of it a bit)"

ArtisanVideos,3arnyr,TheDonkeyWheel,2,Tue Jun 23 18:29:28 2015 UTC,"The transition from the internal car shot to the external, the camera passes through the ""window"" of the front passenger door, and you can see the camera pass the door frame.  I'm willing to bet that's the point where they spliced in the cut from the rigged vehicle for internals to the normal vehicle for the exterior shot.  I don't think it would take too much digital work to make that transition, and it looks nearly flawless in the film.  Anyone watching the entirety of the film, without focusing and replaying that scene, likely would never even take notice of it."

ArtisanVideos,3am2um,Bardfinn,7,Sun Jun 21 23:50:09 2015 UTC,"For a tool? My understanding is that knapping tools takes minutes not hours. For art pieces though, it can take a very long time to, e.g., make a perfectly proportioned arrow head."
ArtisanVideos,3am2um,P-01S,4,Mon Jun 22 02:44:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on the usage. It takes a second to knock off a sharp flake that you can use like a box cutter blade, and maybe a minute to come up with a rough scraping tool. But long and more elaborate points do have their uses.   For example, the Lakota Indians had fairly elaborate arrow/spearheads that were actually used. I believe they had a specially long and fairly elaborate (long points are hard to make) spear head that was designed to snap off inside whatever it hit.   There's a fascinating ray mears documentary where he goes over some early British flint tools. I believe it might be part of his wild food series. Anyways, he goes to some British museum where he brings up and explains some certain flint tools that required extremely skilled knappers. He then went on to explain that often times, while out and about, or for simpler tasks, a simple flame would suffice."
ArtisanVideos,3am2um,xxkid123,2,Mon Jun 22 03:11:13 2015 UTC,"Grinding to resharpen also seems like it takes away less material than knapping a new edge, which seems like a useful trait.  I imagine the choice of stone matters as well? Knapping seems to focus on large clean fractures like you get in flint, obsidian, or glass, but those are very hard & brittle rocks. On the other hand pretty much any stone could be ground away (eventually).   I'm not an expert about stone tools, but I know that metals, ceramics, woods, plastics, etc tend to have a hard & brittle vs soft and flexible opposition in choice of materials. Are stones for tools similar?"

Stones for knapping vary geographically, but they are generally hard and brittle. I would think a softer but tougher stone would be better as an ax. Nowhere near as good as bronze... But better than flint. I'm not sure how well a fire hardened wood ax would do... Maybe it'd work on soft trees if made of a hard, dense wood?"
ArtisanVideos,3am2um,P-01S,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:03:04 2015 UTC,"The wiki page about ground stone axes mentions hornstone, so it does sound like there's some materials choices being made.  I highly doubt even fire hardened wood could cut even soft wood. I have heard of fire hardened skinning knives and wooden splitting wedges though."
ArtisanVideos,3am2um,snarkyxanf,2,Mon Jun 22 04:27:13 2015 UTC,"Hornstone:       Hornfels (German, meaning ""hornstone"") is called so because of its exceptional toughness and texture both reminiscent of animal horns. These properties are due to fine grained non-aligned crystals with platy or prismatic habits. Hornfels is the group designation for a series of contact metamorphic rocks that have been baked and indurated by the heat of intrusive igneous masses and have been rendered massive, hard, splintery, and in some cases exceedingly tough and durable. Hornfels rocks were referred to by miners in northern England as whetstones.

ArtisanVideos,3am2um,snarkyxanf,20,Mon Jun 22 04:55:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting how only the top and bottom are contact points with the stone, then the striking force only places tension on the thin wood part."

A ring of clay was formed around the tree some feet up (2,3,4?) then they'd light a fire around the tree.  The axes were used to bash away the charred parts so the fire could get further into the tree and fell it.  The more you know!"

However, I believe other peoples initiated the felling of trees in a similar fashion prior to technology improvements.  Maybe the celts used shaped stone for the felling of trees, and americans used them to bash away dead wood from the fire."
ArtisanVideos,3am2um,AshKatchumawl,2,Mon Jun 22 03:03:03 2015 UTC,Addendum so you see it:  The ring of clay was to prevent the fire and heat from moving too far up and damaging the rest of the tree.

I abandoned it for a few months after finishing the walls. Also my advice is to use bark for the roof from the start rather than using leaves first- it makes a much better roof with less time and effort. Build the roof first so you have some shelter from the rain and then build the walls- this is how I build my huts. Thanks for the question.

You could build rock walls and use clay straw mix as mortar. Consider, embedding stones or bark into the clay to protect it. Or just add new material after a storm. These are not 20 year shelters.

It makes me long for a culture here in the U.S. that I'll never a have. Not necessarily Japanese but because we are just a new country we don't really have the same type of established traditions as others. Like how Japan will have 1000 year anniversary celebrations for different things. 1015 and our culture was still 700 years away from even beginning.

It's like comparing beethoven to bach. Both use chords, both are really good.   I mean, I don't claim to be an expert, but they did say that Japan has the most advanced joinery in the world,    And they're wrong. Everything shown in that video has been done all across the world for hundreds of years. We didn't have access to mass produced nails for all of eternity. Humans across the world needed to know how to do this stuff to build small and large structures alike.   and I've certainly never seen anything approaching the precision and intricacy in that video.   That's because all those joints shown there are incredibly mundane and boring. Unless you're watching a woodworking tutorial series, you aren't going to see anything like that. This video takes advantage of that and makes it seem like these skills are exclusive to Japan.   Heck, right there in the video it says that they got their woodworking skills from china with Buddhism."

I'd love to know more about it, but as it sits, they did say that it's the most advanced, not the only game in town, which leads me back to my Taylor Swift/Beethoven analogy.

ArtisanVideos,3ahiev,phelyan,4,Sat Jun 20 19:57:17 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Of course you could use a mould and easily create perfectly sized cubes for the drinks. But in the case of high end bars – as this one most likely is – everything has to be perfect. Drink, ambience and service are flawless, and obviously the ice won't be an exception. Therefore not any old ice will do, but only the one with as little impurities and air bubbles as possible. Creating clear ice can be a tedious process, especially in the amounts needed to chill down drinks at a bar. Small silicone moulds don't offer the kind of control needed and will give you perfectly chilling, albeit milky-white ice. There's different ways to create clear ice, but they result in big blocks, therefore the need to cut and shape them down to the final size."
ArtisanVideos,3ahiev,sevennationsalami,0,Sat Jun 20 23:39:15 2015 UTC,"Nope. You can only make clear ice in large blocks make by chilling from one direction only. This slowly freezes the water and allows all of the impurities to be filtered out. You can do it at home by placing water in a beach cooler and leaving the top open, You'll get a large block of mostly clear ice."

Further more, the manager doesn't go around testing peoples hands to see if they are clean, they are busy getting the restaurant ready, and or seeing to customers needs.

Here for example, if the guy washed his hands before cutting the ice - like any sane person handling food for a business would - where is the problem? What, you think you're litteraly going to taste it?  If you're grossed out, fair enough, but don't make this about food safety. It's not, it's cultural. And it's not only food, it's reflected in your culture's attitude towards nudity, human contact, body hair, BO. I mean you even have an acronym for that, that's how uncomfortable it is.

It's got 15C of warming up to do before it gets to freezing point, at which point what you said becomes true.  But the energy absorbed in melting ice at 0C to water at 0C is tiny compared to raising the temperature of ice from somewhere around -15 to 0C, so your point is, largely, not relevant to the thermodynamics of drink cooling.

(And with an ice ball like in the video you start with 0C, not -15C, so ALL of the cooling comes from melting.)   so your point is, largely, not relevant to the thermodynamics of drink cooling.   PLEASE study the subject before posting about it!"

ArtisanVideos,3ahiev,RustyToad,2,Mon Jun 22 05:39:07 2015 UTC,Read up on Enthalpy of fusion (AKA Latent heat of fusion).
ArtisanVideos,3ahiev,asr,3,Mon Jun 22 06:46:25 2015 UTC,"OK.  So, enthalpy of fusion of water is 336 J/g.  Specific heat capacity of water is 4.2 J/(g K).  So melting ice takes as much energy as heating the water the next 80 degrees. Wow. I wasn't just a little bit wrong."
ArtisanVideos,3ahiev,RustyToad,2,Mon Jun 22 07:23:02 2015 UTC,"Yup. I've had this exact argument before, that slower melting ice (because it's larger) just means slower cooling ice, and thus entirely pointless. I got nowhere, so I'm glad to be acknowledged by at least one person.  (And thanks for the correction of 80 degrees, not sure why I remembered 40.)"
ArtisanVideos,3ahiev,asr,0,Mon Jun 22 07:53:29 2015 UTC,The amount of energy from melting ice at 0C is equal to 40 degrees C!   What do you mean by that? Are you trying to imply the energy of melting ice is measured in degrees Celsius?
ArtisanVideos,3ahiev,Jesus_The_Raptor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:40:59 2015 UTC,"It can be measured that way.  The amount of energy it takes to bring water from -1C to -81C (or 1C to 81C) is equal to amount of energy it takes to melt ice, while staying at a constant 0C.  It's called the ""Enthalpy of fusion of water AKA Latent heat of fusion of water"" if you want to look it up.  Both water and ice can exist at the exact same temperature, and changing between them is a huge change in energy, without changing the temperature in a slightest. It's weird, but that's how it works."
ArtisanVideos,3ahiev,asr,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:42:56 2015 UTC,"Ah I get what you mean now. I would have just phrased it as ""equal to the energy needed to heat water 80 degrees"" rather than just saying the energy is equal to 80 degrees."
ArtisanVideos,3ahiev,Jesus_The_Raptor,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:46:46 2015 UTC,"I phrased it that way because we were talking in the context of cooling, not in the context of energy. So amount of cooling from melting ice is equal to the cooling of going from -81C to -1C.  But yes, it's really energy I was talking about."

Unless the director makes the studio use makeup effects, they will always fall back on CG.  source: ex-makeup effects artist who left the film industry for the same reason this guy is."
ArtisanVideos,3acn0r,Fartin_Gary,7,Fri Jun 19 14:17:27 2015 UTC,"And as beautiful as the work was for the dinosaur featured in this video, it really did not stand up to the long slow closeups of its face and its interaction with the actors.  It screamed ""FOAM RUBBER"" at me from the first closeup, which kind of ruined the scene for me.  They really needed a more realistic skin material.    I also think the animatronics, while presumably state of the art, were insufficient for the kind of emotional ""acting"" demanded of this creature.  It felt too slow and mechanical."
ArtisanVideos,3acn0r,cranp,3,Fri Jun 19 08:33:38 2015 UTC,"They really needed a more realistic skin material.   There is silicone, which when done correctly, is indistinguishable from translucent skin. It's also expensive and much heavier to do on something this large. My guess as to why they did foam was weight, budget and/or that the inherent benefits of translucency in silicone would be lost on lizard skin. You can get a pretty good translucency effect with tinted rubber cement paint on top of foam latex. They even say in the video that is what they used.   It felt too slow and mechanical.   Or lethargic and restrained... like something that's dying? This was clearly a choice and not a limitation. They have made life sized dinosaurs that had to be bolted into concrete and would shake the entire soundstage like an earthquake due to the violent speed they could move. They also had eyes that dialated mechanically. This stuff was all possible in 1992.  tl;dr I believe these were all performance choices and not limitations of animatronic technology."

ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,ScumbagScout,30,Mon Jun 22 19:45:05 2015 UTC,Intonation is a better word than tuning for the issue.  The 12th fret should be halfway between the bridge and the nut.  The wiggle room he added would be the allowance he would have to move the individual string saddles.  Since the bridge fell outside of this allowance the scale length of the strings would be wrong and the intonation of the guitar would never be correct.  HtH
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,CaptainQuirk336,18,Thu Jun 18 04:37:01 2015 UTC,But why was the bridge in the wrong place to begin with? Was it just made that way or did the neck physically stretch over time (which seems impossible to me)?
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,Viking_Lordbeast,17,Thu Jun 18 13:29:26 2015 UTC,"At the time (and still now to lots of players) it was close enough. If you stay below about the seventh fret the poor intonation is nearly unnoticeable, and above that it might give the guitar ""character""."

ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,wolverine6,2,Thu Jun 18 03:04:42 2015 UTC,"Yes they are, but they only adjust the open note (string played with no fingers pressed on frets) by tightening the string. The problem with ""intonation"" that everyone saying is that just because the open strings are in tune doesn't mean that the frets are in the right place with regards to the strings. The length of the string also affects the pitch. The bridge adjusts the actual length of the string by moving the string up or down (and a little bit front and back) but if the string needs to be much longer or shorter then the bridge isn't any help and must be moved."

You are applying logic that only works on new, retail items like a pair of shoes or a laptop. Rare, old works of art/instruments/etc have inherent value (the value placed upon them by years of age, reputation, rarity) versus a shitty guitar made of gold which has intrinsic value based, not on the fact that it's a guitar, rather, that it's literally made of something valuable.   To put it simply: Your long-time girlfriend whom you adore is missing a leg. Here's another girl who looks like her who has two legs. Wanna trade? That's inherent value.

It would never have value like a numbers matching original car if it couldn't even run on the factory engine.   Vakue is desirability to a large number of people, which is what I thought he said the guitar had. Not just sentimental value to the original owner as in your girlfriend example.   I guess the closest comparison that comes to mind is misstruck coinage. People collect them strictly because the rarity of their defects. Fascinating either way."
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,Sleeveless9,5,Thu Jun 18 12:22:33 2015 UTC,"""But this would be like the Ferrari having a misbored cylinder in the original engine.""    No, not really at all. This is something that can be (and as you saw was) fixed. So many guitars aren't properly set up when they come out of the factory and its just a matter of having them taken to someone like this who can set them up properly. It's also such a subtle problem that a lot of amateur players wouldn't really notice or care at all (this guy had it for 50 years and didn't think to have it fixed until now).     And if you can avoid drilling holes (and possibly accidentally damaging something) in a mint 50 year old instrument why wouldn't you?"
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,FabulousLastWords,-7,Thu Jun 18 18:01:09 2015 UTC,"I guess your definition of ""mint"" and mine are different. From my perspective, this guitar wasn't even mint when it was new."

ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,Sleeveless9,2,Thu Jun 18 13:31:39 2015 UTC,"Mint is about quality of condition not mechanical operation. This guitar is in mostly the same condition as it was when it was first sold and that's all it needs to be considered mint. If you were to chop this guitar up and make it into a different guitar that played perfectly in every way, no matter how good it sounded it wouldn't be mint anymore.      There are $700 guitars that with the right work done sound and operate better than some $7000 vintage guitars, but that doesn't mean they're somehow ""more mint"" than those older more valuable guitars, that's not how it works."
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,FabulousLastWords,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:44:06 2015 UTC,"As a guitar PLAYER, i'm with you, in that, I wouldn't want the thing just because it's expensive as hell, and requires a handmade fix to get it working like any guitar that isn't considered a dud with factory flaws should already.  These kinds of things are for collectors who can spare the cash to fix something that was made broken."
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,microwave333,3,Thu Jun 18 14:54:13 2015 UTC,"Well no, a misstruck coin is desirable BECAUSE of its defect. The defect in this case is not desirable but it's easily overlooked because the nature of the defect is so minor and easily fixed.   The girlfriend metaphor was simply to unpack the idea of intrinsic versus inherent values.   I guess it feels like you're missing the point with the rarity and desireabily of the guitar. Bluntly, it doesn't matter what's wrong with it. As long as it's not utterly destroyed and unplayable, the richness of its history and rarity (not to mention, when repaired, it probably sounds incredible) deem it to be so valuable that people are willing to overlook flaws in order to obtain it."
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,kula_shakur,4,Thu Jun 18 22:33:23 2015 UTC,"at this point its aguably the instrument's potential. accurate or not, that brand/make of guitar has desirable characteristics to musicians. even with a few flaws, they can still shine."

ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,Hard6Rollin,2,Thu Jun 18 16:33:17 2015 UTC,"At the time it was ""close enough."" Even with the bridge in the position it left the factory at, it probably intimates closer across all six strings than, say, the three saddle bridge on a telecaster. And this is a permanent fix, just a non-invasive one."

ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,kaozennrk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:55:23 2015 UTC,"Your guitar may simply be out of intonation.  There are a bunch of decent videos out there that describe exactly what you should do to set a guitar's intonation, typically by moving the saddle pieces forwards or backwards.  I've done it on a couple of my gits using a tuner and a screwdriver.  Worked out great for me, your mileage may vary."
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,TumorPizza,8,Thu Jun 18 03:21:15 2015 UTC,"If he simply swapped which hole gets which threaded rod on the lower disc, he could have covered the original marks on the guitar and still achieved the desired bridge offset."

ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,UndeadBelaLugosi,5,Thu Jun 18 04:06:33 2015 UTC,Weight distribution across the nut probably. There's a lot of tension there and having that be off-center seems like a bad idea to me.
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,riplox,8,Thu Jun 18 04:34:25 2015 UTC,it really bothered me that they didn't thread into the holes.
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,zootam,26,Thu Jun 18 20:10:49 2015 UTC,"It's actually fairly common for components of stringed instruments to be held in place by tension alone. Upright basses, cellos, violins, and violas all have bridges that are completely separate from the body, and its for reasons like this one in the video. If you want to adjust the intonation on a cello, you have to move the bridge."
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,Hard6Rollin,9,Thu Jun 18 09:21:12 2015 UTC,All of those instruments also have another piece called a soundpost that is held in by string tension! It's located between the top and back plates and is a bitch to reset if you don't have the right tools.
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,Itsthejoker,7,Thu Jun 18 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"many guitars have floating bridges that are only kept on the body by string tension, no holes given."
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,HitlerWasASexyMofo,3,Thu Jun 18 18:22:28 2015 UTC,To add to what the other posters have said:  Any fixed point cuts down on the amount the instrument can vibrate and thus cut down on the sound produced.  Fixed points are kept to a minimum on all instruments with sounding surfaces (string instruments and keyboard instruments).

ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,Brickx3,4,Thu Jun 18 04:08:36 2015 UTC,Doesn't this create a 4-bar linkage and leave the bridge open to rotating around? I don't believe the strings would hold it in place with tension alone.
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,icksq,2,Thu Jun 18 05:32:36 2015 UTC,"The tension on the strings will be more than enough to hold it.  Many guitars, and other stringed instruments like violins, don't have the bridges attached or glued onto the top at all, and rely solely on the string tension to hold them."
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,d3singh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:23:30 2015 UTC,"Doing a quick lookup you not only have about 20lbs of tension each string, but also compression as the strings press downwards on the bridge as well. I'd agree though, and that's the price for preserving the wood on the guitar versus a good permanent fix."

Dave uses the tool for a different job, but works just as well for a guitar and is ten times cheaper. He does still use their parts cups and rulers though.  I agree that StewMac is usually expensive. I wouldn't mind having one of their bridge jacks though, even if I only have one guitar with these skinny bridge posts."
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,valhowla,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:41:16 2015 UTC,"Wait, I always thought the distance from the bridge to the 12th fret must be exactly the same as the distance between the nut and the 12th fret? Why is this not the case here?"
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,lzgr,2,Thu Jun 18 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"The middle of your saddles adjustment range should be exactly half, unless the guitar is intended to be downtuned very far, and the reason is, when bigger strings are fretted, they bend more and throw their accuracy off, which is why the bass side string saddles are always further back than the treble side are."
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,microwave333,2,Thu Jun 18 14:52:28 2015 UTC,"Well it was exactly half before he moved it back 9/64 of an inch for ""compensation"". Is this the compensation you are talking about?"
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,lzgr,2,Thu Jun 18 15:08:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, because the bass side saddle had already been moved back as far as it would go. The saddles have their own independent mobility of the bridge.  It's part of the same reason bass guitars need to be longer, put them on a shorter scale length and they'll be too easily fretted out of tune by a slightly too strong press of the finger."
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,microwave333,2,Thu Jun 18 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I get it now, thanks a lot! Is there any way you can calculate the needed compensation?"
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,lzgr,2,Thu Jun 18 17:10:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but, it's a cluster fuck of number crunching that I don't know hahaha. In most cases, any guitar bridge you buy for a custom build, should have the right amount of saddle adjustment to work with if you put the middle of the adjustment range, at the exact scale length calculated by the distance from the Nut, to the 12th fret, multiplied by two."
ArtisanVideos,3a8axo,microwave333,2,Thu Jun 18 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"Unless you mean like, how does one calculate how much each saddle should be adjusted per string to get the intonation right, because that is just a matter of setting the guitar up trail and error style with an accurate tuner, in which, you play the note Open (Not holding any fretted note down) lets say the note is E, and then you finger fret the 12th (which is an E, an octave higher) play the note, and if it falls flat or sharp, then you move the saddle back or forth, and try again until the open note, and 12th fret, play the same note with the same accuracy, meaning the string is then properly intonated."

ArtisanVideos,3a66ja,TheStaet,10,Wed Jun 17 15:19:41 2015 UTC,Sharpening the blade before working on the handle seems like a needlessly risky move.
ArtisanVideos,3a66ja,Mechanical_Owl,16,Wed Jun 17 19:14:06 2015 UTC,"I know a little about steel and this seems like a pretty big waste of time, unless it was just made for show. Circular saw blades are made from mild steel with a low carbon content, the ability to cut comes from the carbide tips. There was no heat treatment done on this blade either, not that it would really matter with the steel used. However it does look nice."
ArtisanVideos,3a66ja,btbam87,10,Wed Jun 17 17:24:26 2015 UTC,You're totally correct! I don't understand why people put so much time and effort into something that could have been amazing if they'd spent $2 more on the steel.
ArtisanVideos,3a66ja,jstenoien,3,Wed Jun 17 18:54:59 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that shoddy job of mounting the scales (assuming he was going to actually use the thing). But, like you said, it sure did come out looking nice. I just wouldn't trust it to do any real work. Not for long, at least."

ArtisanVideos,3a66ja,appletart,5,Wed Jun 17 17:27:53 2015 UTC,"What we should take from the video is that he took a piece of junk, and using great skill he turned the metal into something both functional and beautiful. Maybe he had used that exact saw to renovate his kitchen, and now the cleaver hangs as the centrepiece - how cool would that be?  Sure, he could have sent off for some nameless steel and crafted a totally anonymous cleaver out of it, but in doing it this way he has a story to tell, and gave us all something to think about."
ArtisanVideos,3a66ja,jstenoien,2,Wed Jun 17 19:52:43 2015 UTC,Agreed except for the functional part :) it's a decorative piece.
ArtisanVideos,3a66ja,appletart,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:41:21 2015 UTC,"At best you'd probably use the cleaver a couple of times a year, and in this case the quality of steel is more than high enough to retain a usable edge."
ArtisanVideos,3a66ja,jstenoien,4,Wed Jun 17 17:41:28 2015 UTC,"It's really not though, IF you could even put an edge on it, it wouldn't even hold it through the first cut. It's so silly that people keep trying to use scrap metal when a piece of 1080 bar is literally a couple dollars."
ArtisanVideos,3a66ja,thelurkerabides,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:44:54 2015 UTC,"I know nothing about steel, but didn't he hack at a piece of wood for awhile, then cut through paper without tearing it? Doesn't that indicate a good edge?"
ArtisanVideos,3a66ja,jstenoien,10,Wed Jun 17 18:47:56 2015 UTC,"He hacked the pole apart (more a function of mass than anything else) and that paper test just proves my point, did you see how close to the edge he had to hold the paper? He also was sawing the knife through the paper, you're supposed to be able to push the knife through the paper, like when you're cutting wrapping paper and the scissors glide."

Deathrattle: Summon a 1/2 Slime with Taunt.   Trump's Board  Cards on the Board   Grim Patron (Patron)    Whenever this minion survives damage, summon another Grim Patron.  Cards in the hand (From left to right)   Slam   Deal 2 damage to a minion. If it survives, draw a card.   Fiery War Axe - (Axe)    (A weapon with 3 attack)   Death's Bite   Deathrattle: Deal 1 damage to all minions.   Frothing Berserker - (Frothing)   Whenever a minion takes damage, gain +1 Attack   Dread Corsair - (Corsair, Pirate)   Taunt. Costs (1) less per Attack of your weapon.   Warsong Commander - (Warsong)   Whenever you summon a minion with 3 or less Attack, give it Charge.   Whirlwind   Deal 1 damage to ALL minions.  Things to consider   Trump only has 8 mana. Each time a card is played from Trump's hard it takes that mana away from his 8 The opponent's Sludge Belcher has 3 attack and 5 health. Because it has the taunt effect Trump must attack it before he can attack the enemy hero. It also has a Deathratlle where it summons a slime minion with 1 attack and 2 health ALSO with taunt. Trump must destroy both of these minions before attacking the enemy hero. Trump can only have 7 minions on his side of the board at a time Warsong commander will give all the minions which trump summons (that are under 3 health) charge which means they can attack the turn that they are spawned Trump's two Dread Corsair's will cost zero mana if Trump plays a weapon first The Deathrattle effect of Death's Bite will activate if Trump replaces his Death's Bite with his Fiery War Axe Grim Patron will summon another version if itself whenever it is damaged and does not die. These new Grim Patron's all will have charge due to the Warsong Commander Frothing Berserker stars with 2 attack so it gains the charge effect from Warsong commander. Trump is using a screenshot of the game to calculate a problem he previously had. In game he would only have 90 seconds to calculate this. He is also communicating with his chat on twitch.tv.   The main problem   The key to this puzzle is to maximize the damage Trump's Frothing Berserker. Frothing Berserker gains 1 attack whenever ANY minion takes damage from any source. Trump needs to decide when to use Whirlwind, when (if ever) to utilize one (or both) of his weapons, and when to attack with his Grim Patrons. All in all he must do 31 damage to his opponents hero to find lethal."

ArtisanVideos,39whvv,Bleue22,16,Mon Jun 15 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"Well, a sphere and a cube both have a perfectly centered center of mass. It is highly compressed, so I imagine it is quite spherical."
ArtisanVideos,39whvv,rhalsmith,5,Mon Jun 15 22:54:48 2015 UTC,That's only true if the density is uniform.  The fact that the corners of the cube get compressed more in order to arrive at a sphere make me think that the density would be greater in those areas.  But I suppose it would still be centered if the corners were symmetrical.

This can be achieved by LCDs but you need very specific hardware, which generally has not been available until recently.  The lag on LCDs that typically prevent them from being highest-end worthy (like smash melee for example) comes from the image processing."
ArtisanVideos,39sn4p,BloodyIron,16,Sun Jun 14 23:06:06 2015 UTC,"Old school CRT tvs also have the special characteristic of really high refresh rates. For example, a regular computer monitor can refresh the screen 60 times in a second. But a CRT can refresh 120+."
ArtisanVideos,39sn4p,BrendanQ,7,Sun Jun 14 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"Modern LCDs can refresh higher, there are 120hz and 144hz monitors, plus some niche ones that can go higher. Games at this level of competitive play though are typically never higher than 60fps, so going over 60hz is meaningless even on a CRT."
ArtisanVideos,39sn4p,BloodyIron,14,Sun Jun 14 23:04:33 2015 UTC,"Its not the refresh rate that's the issue, it the input latency. LCD TVs have a noticeable latency when playing at high levels while CRT TVs have effectively none that affect gameplay"

ArtisanVideos,39sn4p,meelg,2,Sun Jun 14 15:39:26 2015 UTC,"This is really impressive! However, I still think the original version of tetris is harder in some respects as you can't slide blocks nearly as easily and you only get knowledge of the next piece as opposed to next 3. There is also no way to hold pieces and switch them, you have to play what you get. Here is a video of someone beating lvl 29 on traditional nes tetris, I think this the only person who has ever been able to beat it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcdB-CFLjJU When he gets to lvl 29 the pieces are moving pretty fast but not as fast in the video linked, however the thing to understand is that with nes tetris it's actually not possible to get the pieces to the side of the screen on this lvl unless you use a special button mashing technique that this guy developed."
ArtisanVideos,39sn4p,WingedThing,16,Sun Jun 14 23:27:39 2015 UTC,"TGM 3 actually reduces the time for blocks to lock in place as you go further, so it's not that much easier. TGM 3 also has a lot of conditions that you must fulfill in order to get the Grand Master ranking, such as time constraints (reaching a certain line count by a certain time). Also to even qualify for GM you need to have (IIRC) done the same thing (clearing up until the invisible credits) multiple times in a row - the progress is tracked on your account; yes, you have to have a player account to play TGM 3."

I walked away from this video (whenever I first saw it) thinking that Gervais put them all to shame. They are professional comedians, working a job, but Gervais came across as an artist who only cares for his craft. I specifically remember Gervais talking about bad laughs, and cutting material that got bad laughs, and the three other guys are like, ""Are you crazy? A laugh is a laugh!"" And Gervais just couldn't bring himself to agree.  Now, I will add, I fucking adore the other three. I've watched nearly every episode of both Louis's show and Jerry's coffee show, and Rock is legend, even though some of his stuff is bad and I've never seen bad Louis or bad Jerry. But fuck all that noise. Rock is Rock. He's one of a kind. Anyway, Gervais--to me--based on this video--is on a higher level than those three."

I don't say that to put you off, I say that to prepare you. You will have to spend a lot of time dropping balls and not understanding why you suck. You will also need to do this every single day.  0-3 Months   Start with three balls, learn the basic cascade, practice two in one hand, tennis, learn fake columns and true columns, and practice moving between patterns.  3-12 Months  Then start learning take outs, slams, chops, shuffles, Mill's Mess and the many variations, behind the back throws, body stalls etc., Keep linking these and juggling to music, exploring movement. Start working on multiplexes (two balls thrown from one hand at the same time) and explore siteswap juggling notation.  Beyond  Start playing with different toys like clubs, rings, hats, and anything that you can throw. Study other styles and explore your own.   If you want a style like the guy in the video (much closer to the European/Scandinavian expressive style) then I'd shy away from the traditional American style of 'clown' juggling which is all about impressive variations of the traditional patterns and things that impress children. The Euro/Scando/Modern style is much more dance like and all about full fluid movements.  Have lots of fun."

But I couldn't even touch one tenth of the skills and fine control he has. Man."

ArtisanVideos,39oni8,Fr31l0ck,5,Sat Jun 13 16:43:15 2015 UTC,I'd suggest listening to the podcast before watching the show. I hated the show the first time I watched it. It's currently one of my favorites but I do get that it's not for everyone

ArtisanVideos,39oni8,partcomputer,4,Sat Jun 13 19:59:56 2015 UTC,Try the podcast out (there are multiple best of episode series). I've been a huge fan of the podcast for years and have never really loved the show. Basically they tried to make a mostly scripted show centered around Auckerman out of an entirely improv based podcast centered around the guests.
ArtisanVideos,39oni8,FabulousLastWords,2,Sat Jun 13 21:21:36 2015 UTC,"It's the type of humor. I'm not sure why I like Tim and Eric and Comedy Bang Bang, but the styles they have give me this powerful feeling that I'm always in on their inside-joke about reality. While T&E tends to be even more abstract, the satire and mockery of the talk show format is pretty pleasant.   I think there might be some relevance in the fact that I hate advertising. I hate it so much that I sort of enjoy satirical advertising in, say, GTA games, but it lacks a huge component. It doesn't necessarily leave you with a good feeling. I think that's where Comedy Bang Bang succeeds. They mock a lot of the tedium of how a talk show is traditionally presented, but they still do it in a way that leaves you in a state where you don't realize the negativity  I guess it sort of comes down to it not being one-dimensional. Normally, humor is supposed to be obvious and whatnot, but making it all into very subtle mockery makes it easy to watch and unique in the randomness they throw in for every episode. If you watch more of it, you'll realize each episode tends to have a sort of philosophical theme, for lack of a better term. Time travel, dimensions, all sorts of huge ideas thrown in."

ArtisanVideos,39ivl0,tunersharkbitten,2,Fri Jun 12 05:46:25 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, you shouldn't. Any added ingredients, be that sugar, butter or herbs, will impact how the yeast feeds.  But practically, it makes such a small difference to the home baker, that I would say why the hell not. A thing we did at college was Sun dried tomato and rosemary buns. Worked great. Mixed the sun dried tomatoes in right from the beginning and continue as you normally would. Tasted pretty nice too Don't think too deep into it, just play around and have fun :)"

ArtisanVideos,39ivl0,tunersharkbitten,3,Tue Jun 16 04:53:01 2015 UTC,"No, you do not want to do that. What makes the dough work is the gluten strands which will help to capture pockets of carbon dioxide into bubbles, which get filled by the butter. Herbs and seeds will cut up the gluten strands as you knead and shape the dough, which will make for a denser dough that won't rise as much"
ArtisanVideos,39ivl0,jealkeja,2,Fri Jun 12 10:52:04 2015 UTC,thats what i was afraid of.   what about powderizing the herbs?
ArtisanVideos,39ivl0,tunersharkbitten,3,Fri Jun 12 14:45:53 2015 UTC,What's wrong with the herbs on top?
ArtisanVideos,39ivl0,asr,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:50:55 2015 UTC,"nothing,  but i wondered if it was possible to make the rest of the dough on the inside fragrant and flavorful."
ArtisanVideos,39ivl0,mrsflowers,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:56:37 2015 UTC,"You can probably use spice oil or essence instead. It's a lot of work, but you can make the essence yourself, check how they do it for perfume."
ArtisanVideos,39ivl0,picodroid,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:47:21 2015 UTC,If you scale the amount of seeds correctly it will still develop and rise very well.
ArtisanVideos,39ivl0,double2,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:01:36 2015 UTC,"Warning: I am a very novice baker so I could be completely wrong.   Not sure about all herbs, but things like garlic, sugar, salt, and onion can impact the dough. The yeast feeds on sugar but breaks down gluten strands, while more salt will keep the yeast from doing its work but will strengthen the gluten. From what I can recall, garlic and onion can kill the yeast so you won't get the proofing/rise from the dough. Fresh/leaved herbs might be ok but some may contain oils or other chemicals that could damage the flour/gluten or the yeast. I would recommend looking up breads including the herbs you like to see if other recipes include it during the dough creation or advise against it.   Ultimately, you probably wouldn't get too much of an effect if you add it in right near the middle where he rounds the buns out, as he's folding and pinching the sides into the middle. You could likely work it a little more as you incorporate the herbs and make it the ball then let it rest. At this point, the yeast has done most of its magic (as you see, the dough doesn't rise as much as it did overnight)."

There is a design philosophy behind the name and lineage.    An opinion is reflective of the people who make it, and is reflect of something you believe to be true (whether it is or not), otherwise you'd be questioning yourself and thus not a true opinion.  You need to learn what an opinion mean..."
ArtisanVideos,39cxa8,sirgallium,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:24:31 2015 UTC,"Everybody has different tastes, whatever. If he prefers the stock miata let him have it.  I've always wanted to do a similar v8 miata build, but now that I've thought about it more it really is a ton of work to do. Because of that I think I would pick a different car simply based on looks. All that effort and it still looks like a miata... not that that's an ugly car but it's not the coolest looking either.  Ideally I would like to do this with a similar size but better looking car like an RX-7, a Z car, or anything small and good looking. The miata is just so bland appearing."
ArtisanVideos,39cxa8,Ijustsaidfuck,3,Thu Jun 11 11:24:25 2015 UTC,The reason the Miata has become a favorite to stuff a V8 into is because the car retains it's good handling and feel even with a big motor.    Mazda engineers even think so. https://youtu.be/T2BSSy7fxOc?t=196

I'm a stupid enginameeer but seeing him and AvE mill shit makes me want to quit my job, buy a Bridgeport and become a machinist or welder.

Extra painfulll  Edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lPNqn8LU4Q watch this dude in his 70s spend an hour talking about the theory of consistent milling of gears and you'll see how things are supposed to be properly constructed.

He definitely knows what he's doing though. Probably not a pro machinist (hey neither am I) but I went from ""meh"" to ""yeah this is real good"" by the end of episode 4.   Edit: in traditional machining, you have a lot more focus on accuracy. He rotated his lathe like 4 degrees in one episode (at best you'll get within half a degree, you generally want to machine with +/- 3 in 1000ths of an inch), and I just assumed he wasn't using a dial indicator or whatever.

ArtisanVideos,391lki,fruitbooploops,9,Mon Jun 8 21:08:47 2015 UTC,"How do you go about ""qualifying"" that something is or isn't hyperrealism based on the skill of the artist?  Hyperrealism is a style, just like impressionism, and has a very wide spectrum of mastery.  Whether or not the artist achieved your personally desired level of detail is absolutely irrelevant to which style the art was done.  There are very, very few pieces that achieve an indistinguishable level of detail, that doesn't mean that the enormous swath of other attempts are suddenly not hyperrealism.  What you're doing here is espousing your opinion, and acting as if your opinion is canon.  It kinda has an inverse effect on the notion that you have any idea what you're talking about."

Yes. It does. This painting is realism, bordering on photorealism. It's quite clearly a painting, though. I suspect it would be even easier to tell seeing it in person rather than a YouTube video. In the finished piece I can see the artist's hand, if you know what I mean. I can see his pen and brushstrokes. Hyperrealism is in a totally different realm, as the name would suggest. You can be standing inches away and still insist it's a photograph. Pedro Campos is one of my favorites"
ArtisanVideos,391lki,Lostcause_,-2,Mon Jun 8 21:55:52 2015 UTC,I can tell those are a drawing just as easily as I can tell the M&Ms are....
ArtisanVideos,391lki,ThingsIveSeenandDone,-5,Tue Jun 9 06:40:20 2015 UTC,"Hyperrealism is not a style in and of itself. It is an extension of the realism style. Realism is the representation of an object or elements presented with no embellishment. It is intended to present what the artist sees, literally.  Hyperrealism, by contrast, dictates that the artwork be indistinguishable from a photograph of the subject - i.e. the picture is so realistic it could be confused with a photorgraph. If someone with an untrained eye can very easily identify that the subject is a painting, then by definition it is not hyperrealism. It is just realism or photorealism."
ArtisanVideos,391lki,devilkin,7,Mon Jun 8 21:53:09 2015 UTC,"Except hyperrealism doesn't dictate anything like that.  Hyperrealism RESEMBLES a high definition photograph.  You are making definitions and delineations where none exist.  There is no pyramid chart with realism at one level, photo realism at another, and hyperrealism at its peak.  There is no bullet in the definition of hyperrealism that says ""IF art is not indistinguishable from a photo, THEN it is not hyperrealism.""   If someone with an untrained eye   I assume that you're speaking of yourself in this instance, unless you're saying that you are viewing the picture with someone else's untrained eye...    Take it from someone that's been doing this for over 20 years, and has a very trained eye.  You really need to do your research before dealing in absolutes with anything concerning art.  I'd suggest grabbing a book about Hyperrealism ;)    EDIT:  Okok... I know I'm going to get a silly reply anyways, but I want to preface your reply with: ""You have the last word.""  Because I Don't Care About Internets Arguments!!!"
ArtisanVideos,391lki,thejustducky1,5,Mon Jun 8 22:10:20 2015 UTC,"I had a friend who could do ultra-realistic drawing such as this.  Her method was to make a transparency sheet with a grid printed on it.  You lay the grid over your source image, then have a matching grid over your canvas.  You draw the image in one square at a time.  When she was finished you'd swear it was a photograph.  I think it was more of a mental thing.  The grid breaks it up into bite sized chunks.  It was interesting to see a work in progress, because often she would skip around grid squares."
ArtisanVideos,391lki,tylerdoubleyou,10,Tue Jun 9 01:27:40 2015 UTC,"Could someone explain to me why he switches between so many different types of coloring medium instead of sticking with one kind (I see color pencil, markers, water color, spray paint, etc). Does it make the job easier? Are photo-real painting typically done with multiple mediums or single medium?"
ArtisanVideos,391lki,metabug,19,Mon Jun 8 20:43:21 2015 UTC,"I'm no artist, but I would bet that each medium helps to create a certain texture that is necessary to look hyper-realistic."
ArtisanVideos,391lki,haminacup,12,Mon Jun 8 22:07:43 2015 UTC,"Almost every art piece is done with more than one medium, with a few exceptions like most stone sculpture.   For example, pretty much every painting is done overtop of a sketch, which is done in any medium from charcoal to gouache, most illustrations will have charcoal and pencil and ink for different levels of detail and contrast, and so on and so forth.   Of course, anything can be done with a single medium. Doing it single medium however can make something more difficult or time consuming or error prone. Making a water color of a flower overtop a light pencil sketch is relaxing and fun, doing the same with no sketch and it becomes frustrating and never quite turns out how you want it.  The main point of using different mediums is that they offer different levels of control and effect. The paint he's using is good for blocking in a big area without leaving any distinctive lines or internal borders like a marker or pencil would do. The pencils offer maximum control and the ability to lay down subtle detail. The soft white pencil is good for laying down a strong highlight that completely masks the paper and color underneath it. The list goes on.  A good artist follows the mantra of ""No rules, Just tools."" You can use any medium however you want, whether it be a trick to make things easier, or help achieve a desired effect that would otherwise be unnecessarily tedious, etc. Hope that clears things up for you a bit :)"
ArtisanVideos,391lki,Norose,2,Mon Jun 8 22:10:12 2015 UTC,"It's all about effect and texture.  Eventually, you learn a large repertoire of different styles, mediums, tools, and ways to achieve certain effects.  Brushes and watercolors provide textureless, very smooth gradients; pencils are much more precise, but it's harder to achieve smooth areas of solid color; white pencils and white paint are just about the only way to get crisp edge highlights.    Sometimes you have one perfect tool for the job you're working on, sometimes you have 20."
ArtisanVideos,391lki,thejustducky1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:27:21 2015 UTC,Just consider the different mediums as tools. He's using the tools that he believes as a practiced artist will best achieve his desired results. This probably came from hours of experimentation.

Only then does the camera focus, to show a cosy bathroom, with some rustic details in the background.  We see a man, with a beard and glasses. Probably a flanel shirt. He sits down, and unfolds his newspaper. Make sure that the crumpling of the newspaper can be heard extremely well. All the straining, loud exhaling and splashes should be recorded in exquisite detail.  Make sure to insert some shots of the bathroom from the outside, while we're hearing whats happening on the inside. Also focus on some irrelevant details, like a little doll that's standing on a windowsill. Wrap it up with a close-up of an ass being wiped, sideview. One wipe, extreme efficiency.

Artisan work may be a subjective term but it is without doubt that this sub relies on the videos of both hobby makers and professionals. Furthermore to claim that artisan is something more than just making things is fairly arbitrary and hardly provides anything to the discussion. This board needs to get off it's high horse and ""questionable"" snobbery, lest it get reduced to videos of people making knives and mosaics."
ArtisanVideos,38xtws,Yeastextract,0,Mon Jun 8 12:00:00 2015 UTC,"Furthermore to claim that artisan is something more than just making things is fairly arbitrary   Do you claim that they are synonymous? There's 100% overlap between ""people making things"" and ""artisan""? Or is there some difference there?  I realize ""artisan"" is a loaded and subjective word. Nonetheless, I think at the very least it has to include ""knows how to use the tools relevant to the task"". DiResta in general and this video in particular do not meet that definition. Watch his videos all you want--I'm not saying they aren't interesting or fun or even important. They just aren't artisan. It's OK not to be artisan. It's not OK to post that video here."

Obviously now you have provided reason - ""knows how to use the tools relevant to the task"". I think this is a pretty poor judgement on your part seeing as he obviously does know how to use the tools and the limits to which he can push them. As i say the guy has 40 years experience, we may at the very least respect his overbearing knowledge and creative performance. It is not fair to claim that he does not know what he is doing, nor to say that he does not provide innovative and creative methods by which he 'does' so to speak.  I'm happy to watch his videos with or without your blessing but i claim that they are an expression of artisanal skill at the very least an expression of 'trade' knowledge, and they should be accepted as such.

It does matter how it was done if you are claiming I'm about to watch an artisan at work.  Imagine if the video had been of an assembly line producing ice picks with no humans in sight. ""The end product works, why does it matter how it was done?"" Because that's not artisan!  Edit: If I came here to watch an ice pick being made, I'd be satisfied.

You might similarly despise his other techniques which do not meet the safety criteria of a professional workspace. It is fact he has used this tool to create an object regardless of the criteria required to pass an exam that is needed for professional employment in the machining field. This is criteria which he obviously does not need to meet considering he isn't a machinist. You may argue that what he has created is pointless and less functional then the original but that does not detract from the process or the craftsmanship of the final piece, especially considering it is for personal use. The fact of the matter is that he is vastly experienced and has used and knows his tools and the limits of them better than anyone on this sub. Your point is moot."

Basically, just imagine the work sticking out like a foot and then applying enough pressure to the tip to shear metal off of it. What do you think it's going to do?

He uses dies to cut the pockets so it takes him a minute a pocket. Skiving probably took 30 minutes, dye and condition another 30, construction an hour. Add in some dry time and some ""what next"" time, I'd say four hours is reasonable.   Thing is, craftsman can't charge like that. We aren't laborers. It's not hourly thing. It's a skill, brand, material, and time thing. Charge what it's worth. Who's worth?   I don't think that wallet is worth more than $100.

ArtisanVideos,38rp7g,blaowppow,8,Sat Jun 6 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"It's because he's mic'd up in the store, similar to those dudes demoing products at Costco."
ArtisanVideos,38rp7g,HLef,3,Sat Jun 6 10:10:26 2015 UTC,"I've been to this candy/ice cream shop with my sister and her husband. If you time it right you can watch them making the candy. Unfortunately we just missed the demonstration, but we talked to the guy while he was cleaning up and it was really interesting to hear about all the different parts to the process and actually get to see all their flavorings and stuff."
ArtisanVideos,38rp7g,leschwe,3,Sat Jun 6 12:15:18 2015 UTC,I've only seen one of those brass machines and it was in horrible condition (for use in making ribbon candy). I'd love to get my hands on one in this condition. Confectionery is a lost art.
ArtisanVideos,38rp7g,im4punk,4,Sat Jun 6 19:43:36 2015 UTC,They look pretty interesting. i am surprised that they didn't have a hook to fold the candy on. Generally those who make handmade candy use a hook for efficiency.
ArtisanVideos,38rp7g,everfalling,11,Sat Jun 6 12:20:28 2015 UTC,"The table he's folding on is heated. If he folded in mid air on a hook the candy would harden before he was able to put it through the die. The table keeps things pliable. Taffy doesn't harden in the same way, as he said due to the water content, so you can fold that on a hook without it becoming hard."
ArtisanVideos,38rp7g,im4punk,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:23:13 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit surprised too, but it's been a while since I've done pulled sugar and maybe they've had problems in the past with it?  Whatever gloves he is using still doesn't keep out a ton of the heat (you can see that when he starts pulling), so you would think that using a hook would be beneficial just for avoiding the heat over time. Personally, I'd use it just to allow gravity to do most of the work = efficient chef."
ArtisanVideos,38rp7g,everfalling,3,Sat Jun 6 14:40:55 2015 UTC,The table is heated. Using a hook would make the candy turn hard because it would be continually cooling.
ArtisanVideos,38rp7g,dreadful05,3,Sat Jun 6 12:40:32 2015 UTC,Another interesting one is this where they're making candy canes.

ArtisanVideos,38nzjw,benbrandt22,46,Fri Jun 5 13:21:34 2015 UTC,"The challenge was to build ""something creative"" using only a 2x4 as the primary source of material.

The users over at /r/SomethingIMade thought you might enjoy this video over here.  (The finished product)"
ArtisanVideos,38nzjw,interiot,9,Fri Jun 5 13:24:03 2015 UTC,Did you have any problems with the gears?  Most wood gears I've seen are made from high-quality plywood to avoid warping and such.
ArtisanVideos,38nzjw,jhmf,9,Sat Jun 6 01:07:33 2015 UTC,"There was some slight warping, mainly because cheap 2x4's aren't fully dried, so they warp when cut down thinner. My main issue was tight spots between them, due to imperfections in my gear cutting. I had to go back and do more shaving/sanding of the teeth until they all meshed together smoothly."

That goes to Jim Steinbrecher:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e9F_1sGOXA  I was stunned at how well they turned out. The smaller ""output hole"" burnished the surface of the dowel as it came through, so some of them came out really shiny & smooth."
