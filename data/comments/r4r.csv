r4r,3e3068,THEMESSlAH,0,Tue Jul 21 20:48:39 2015 UTC,Hi. I'm a 22 year old male from the Seattle area. I know you said eventually text but what do you have in mind in the mean time? Reddit inbox? If so that's cool. PM me if you'd like to chat. :)
r4r,3e3068,lightjedi5,0,Tue Jul 21 16:43:14 2015 UTC,Hi! Recently been going through bouts of depression. I find myself just being to vent or someone to lend an unbiased ear. I'm a nurse! You should be excited about nursing school! PM me if you'd like to chat

r4r,3e21s3,suddenfearofchange,3,Tue Jul 21 10:25:31 2015 UTC,"Refreshing to see another UK user on here, 24, Male, Brum/West Midlands myself. I'm currently swimming in free time at the moment, especially since I finished college & don't go back until late September. I'll admit I'm pretty good at entertaining myself during most of the week binge-watching TV shows (I'm currently watching House MD for the second time) and drawing/painting for hours on end. I don't leave home without my pocket notepad as I tend to have a brain that doesn't shut down and let me think a coherent linear set of thoughts without bombarding me with inane thoughts and images I have to scribble down before the next one pops in... so yeah if that wasn't obvious I love art.  I also tried OKCupid for looking for friends or something more but never seemed to have much luck with it as I had/have a tendency to write long winded messages without really getting much of a point across. So I guess it's kinda skewed that I spend most of my time on the internet but am generally much better at communicating coherently face-to-face.  I've pretty much drifted apart from most of my old friends, due to most of them moving away to university or just moving on with their own lives, similar to the situation with your best friend. So I could always use a fresh excuse to ""get some fresh air"" as you so eloquently put it :P... so it would be refreshing to have a fellow human being to just hang out with at least.  Though just chatting online would be a sensible place to start."

I'm also 22 years old, from Germany (though my accent is only very slight), God damn right I have a beard, not that tall however at 5'8 :( I'm not athletic but I'm fit, I got blue/green-ish eyes and VEEERY dark brown hair.   I love laughing and making others laugh and consider myself somewhat of a thinker and at times I try to be all poetic and stuff, so I suppose that sorta relates to having a quick tongue! I'm into a lot of stuff and I'm very adaptive, but mostly I like going out and having fun, all kinds of arts, do live performance acting and recently got a lot into traveling, too!   I'm definitely positive and would like to think that I'm outgoing and adventurous as well, though I'll leave all of the judging to other people honestly :)   I'm currently looking for friends in far away places, hoping to see more of different cultures and perhaps, if it comes to that, more of the world when I come meet them!

r4r,3e1kll,chickwithglasses,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:11:12 2015 UTC,"Most of the ones here are towards the latter stages, so lucidity isn't exactly common. Though it is pretty depressing when they ask about their Mum/Dad or wife/husband. :("
r4r,3e1kll,chickwithglasses,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:12:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah. That always hits me hard. I think, just looking at them makes me sad though. To know they lived such a life but they probably don't remember much of it. I cherish my memories. It scares me to think I could end up the same way. It's also hard to watch how deteriorating dementia really is. It's like watching a candle slowly burn down to nothing."

And what you never really think about at the time is, as you say, they have lived a full life, and at one point was the age I am right now.

r4r,3e0yva,lovetolovetoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:42:59 2015 UTC,"But what's wrong with lots of words? Clearly, it seems to be the case that most people agree with you. And to some degree, I certainly do too; you don't always need to have huge pieces to have good conversation, quick back and forth can be nice.   But what's wrong with longer, well thought out messages? What's wrong with someone asking you about a topic and actually telling them? Responding with something long and deep, taking your time to actually respond to it and not just give them a superficial sentence or two? Especially in the format of starting out in PMs on Reddit. What's wrong with taking your time and actually responding to someone? How are you actually supposed to get to know anybody if you can't actually tell them deep ideas or thoughts, or they won't do the same for you?  Clearly, that's not what people want. They don't want to invest time. They don't want to invest themselves. Plenty of people seem to say they like ""good, deep, intellectual conversation"" and to be frank, none of those people who have claimed that that I've spoken to have lived up to it. What they want and what they say/do are different things. This place is far more superficial than it claims to be. And wanting something deep, finding someone who will take some time to read what I write, and actually respond to it in turn, I don't see anything wrong with that. It's appalling to think that not one of the people responding to my post actually included their favorite color, favorite animal, or anything about themselves. Absolutely appalling. I guess I just don't fit in here."

Just my 4"" cell phone screen and with messaging on here there's no way to delete messages. I also don't want people to think I am ignoring because I may have missed a message. :)"

It was truly fascinating how wonderful and friendly they were to a stranger from America.  I've never met anyone in the states as kind as the Norwegians. I was there about 14 years ago (I'm 30), and that was a family tour.  Sadly I was there for only a few short days, we stayed in Oslo.  I would love to go back as an adult and experience the culture again! Anyways I just wanted to say hi, if you're up for a chat say hello!"

I love that feeling. hehe   Tonight I'm relaxing before bed. I've been productive today! But that's all boring. lol   I can't even imagine what it would be like to be Vince Gilligan and his writers and to create what they have. Sooo impressive!
