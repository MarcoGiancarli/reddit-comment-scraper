SaltLakeCity,3e10dj,vendetta4guitar,5,Tue Jul 21 05:55:43 2015 UTC,Yeah it's very ignorant to just make that leap that this means active Mormons are using the site. I've lived in other states and I've never met anyone that is in an open relationship or a swinger until i came to SLC and met Exmos. I would think it's more of an Exmo related statistic.
SaltLakeCity,3e10dj,Grobbley,4,Tue Jul 21 15:11:53 2015 UTC,"This isn't about open relationships or swinging, it's about cheating.  An ""exmo"" in an open relationship wouldn't feel the need to cheat but a Mormon married early largely or entirely due to external (family/church) pressure or a Mormon who is otherwise unhappy in their marriage but feel no means of escape as a result of the same external pressures (like my gay male Mormon friend with a wife and 3 kids who is generally very depressed with his situation and ""cheats"" on his wife [who knows he is gay] regularly) very well may feel the need to cheat.  There's nothing ignorant about this conclusion.  Those who are less able to explore their desires freely are going to be more likely to do so deceptively.  An ""exmo"" would be less likely to feel the need to cheat, since they have much less societal constraint on their choices in the first place."
SaltLakeCity,3e10dj,vendetta4guitar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:06 2015 UTC,"I was referring to the sexual taboos that are prevalent is exmos. And seeing a stat that says utah has high rates of usage on a ""cheating"" site, doesnt mean automatically mean that LDS people are using it at a higher rate.  First day in statistics class you learn correlation does not equal causation. There could be many other reasons that cause the high usage in Utah. And to say that the site is only used for cheating is silly. There's no verification of marriage licenses. Plenty of people on there,  I speculate,  area just looking to get laid. That being said, i feel certain that the sexual repressive nature of the church absolutely causes people to use this type of site. But Utah simply having a higher rate of use, is not data that proves anything, except more Utahns per capita, use Ashley Madison."

It used to surprise me when I was a child when a member of our bishopric was excommunicated from the Mormon church for such. Then another member and then another it was starting to become the norm. So many people in our neighborhood were hooking up with each other and some were in fact doing it in the church house. There is so much hypocrisy when it comes to Mormons themselves that it is appalling. This comes as no surprise to me.
SaltLakeCity,3e10dj,timmylace,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:33:16 2015 UTC,Doesn't Utah have a high divorce rate and now SLC is the 4th highest users per capita on Ashley Madison.That's pretty sad lol.
SaltLakeCity,3e10dj,dangerous03,9,Tue Jul 21 08:16:21 2015 UTC,"I don't really know why people think this. You can look it up. The average divorce rate in the US is 3.6 divorces per 1000 people each year. Utahs is 4.1. So you could say ""high"" as in its higher than the average but really that is likely within one standard deviation. So that would make it ""normal"" right? Also when you you compare it to the highest 7.1 (Nevada) we don't look even remotely bad. And if you compare it to the highest a decade ago (11.4, Nevada) we are doing really well.  Also another thing to consider is that Utah has a higher than normal marriage rate. So there are still more people getting married and being okay with that, than people getting divorced.  So high, but high when you compare it to an average, without looking at the surrounding data or information. Normal if you do."

SaltLakeCity,3dync8,TweetPoster,2,Mon Jul 20 16:34:44 2015 UTC,Isn't there some law about not being able to pass on right or something?
SaltLakeCity,3dync8,mistAreads,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:37 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda foggy on this I'll admit,  but my dad was uhp when I was learning to drive, he told me it is illegal to pass on the right unless the vehicle in front if you is impeding traffic, that was nearly 15 years ago but I imagine it still stands.  It's also one of those laws that virtually no officer will waste their time enforcing."
SaltLakeCity,3dync8,fullmetalutes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:46:05 2015 UTC,"41-6a-705 Passing upon right -- When permissible   (1)    The operator of a vehicle may overtake and pass on the right of another vehicle only:  (a)    when the vehicle overtaken is making or preparing to make a left turn; or  (b)    on a roadway with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for two or more lines of vehicles moving lawfully in the direction being traveled by the overtaking vehicle.  (2)    The operator of a vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle on the right only under conditions permitting the movement with safety.  (3)    Except for a person operating a bicycle, the operator of a vehicle may not overtake and pass another vehicle if the movement is made by driving off the roadway.  (4)    A violation of this section is an infraction."
SaltLakeCity,3dync8,CultZero,2,Tue Jul 21 04:57:06 2015 UTC,Wow thank you for actually posting this. My friend argue over it all the time. Sweet
SaltLakeCity,3dync8,mistAreads,0,Tue Jul 21 05:22:41 2015 UTC,"That law refers to highways, not interstates. Utah has no laws regarding passing on the right on the interstates. Utah only specifies that slower traffic must yield the left lane and that trailers are prohibited from driving in the left lane.          In case you don't believe me: the chapter specifically says ""highways""; there are no left turns on interstates for which drivers would need to slow; interstates always have sufficient width for two or more lines of vehicles; there are never conditions on interstates that would make passing on the right inherently unsafe (except maybe passing semis); and, bicycles aren't allowed on interstates.        Literally none of those provisions apply to interstates.        Oh, to be clear, I'm referring to passing in a right hand lane -- not passing on the right hand side of traffic that is already in the right most lane. That is very illegal and dangerous."
SaltLakeCity,3dync8,gizamo,2,Tue Jul 21 06:12:11 2015 UTC,"That law refers to highways, not interstates.   If you read the definition section the definition for highway covers freeways.   ""Highway"" means the entire width between property lines of every way or place of any nature when any part of it is open to the use of the public as a matter of right for vehicular travel.  ""Freeway"" means a controlled-access highway that is part of the interstate system as defined in Section 72-1-102.      Utah only specifies that slower traffic must yield the left lane   That is under the previous section: 41-6a-704   (1) (a) On any highway:  (i) the operator of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall:  (A) except as provided under Section 41-6a-705, promptly pass the overtaken vehicle on the left at a safe distance; and  (B) enter a right-hand lane or the right side of the roadway only when safely clear of the overtaken vehicle;  (ii) the operator of an overtaken vehicle:  (A) shall give way to the right in favor of the overtaking vehicle; and  (B) may not increase the speed of the vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle.  (b) The exemption from the minimum speed regulations for a vehicle operating on a grade under Section 41-6a-605 does not exempt the vehicle from promptly passing a vehicle as required under Subsection (1)(a)(i)(A).  (2) On a highway having more than one lane in the same direction, the operator of a vehicle traveling in the left general purpose lane:  (a) shall, upon being overtaken by another vehicle in the same lane, yield to the overtaking vehicle by moving safely to a lane to the right; and  (b) may not impede the movement or free flow of traffic in the left general purpose lane.  (3) An operator of a vehicle traveling in the left general purpose lane that has a vehicle following directly behind the operator's vehicle at a distance so that less than two seconds elapse before reaching the location of the operator's vehicle when space is available for the operator to yield to the overtaking vehicle by traveling in the right-hand lane is prima facie evidence that the operator is violating Subsection (2).  (4) The provisions of Subsection (2) do not apply to an operator of a vehicle traveling in the left general purpose lane when:  (a) overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction in accordance with Subsection (1)(a)(i);  (b) preparing to turn left or taking a different highway or an exit on the left;  (c) responding to emergency conditions;  (d) avoiding actual or potential traffic moving onto the highway from an acceleration or merging lane; or  (e) following the direction of a traffic-control device that directs the use of a designated lane."
SaltLakeCity,3dync8,CultZero,2,Tue Jul 21 06:52:15 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. The definitions link didn't work (likely my spotty Internet connection), but I'll take your word for it because that would explain why I couldn't find a section detailing rules for interstates. It also seems like a really silly thing to fib about.          That said, I'll still pass left-lane loafers on the right while on my motorcycle. I can do so in seconds with the flick of a wrist, then serve my own brand of vigilante justice (i.e. I get in front of them and politely indicate/blink to the right for a few seconds to help them realize they are being turds)."

SaltLakeCity,3dync8,Iamametameta,2,Tue Jul 21 05:03:17 2015 UTC,"East coast is a constant traffic jam because there's millions of people on tiny roads. I agree it's worse, but it's also a different type of clusterturderry.         To explain: SLC is a cluster turd jam thanks to about 100,000 idiots. The other million in the SLC metro area drive fast, sure, but we only have problems when we mix with a few of the 100,000 idiots. It's one thing to idle in a traffic jam that spans miles because of simple congestion. It is quite another to put along behind three minivans driving side-by-side on the freeway at 10 mph under the limit when you can see completely empty roads just in front of them."
SaltLakeCity,3dync8,gizamo,2,Tue Jul 21 06:31:04 2015 UTC,As an European that came to SLC 2 years ago I still get confused and angry at all the people driving slowly in the middle lane. The only thing worse is when every lane is going at the same speed.

Also, if we Utahans could legalize lane-splitting already, motorcyclers (like me) could zip up in front of the slowpokes that block the left lanes to blink them over.

I was in the left lane, no one behind me, hardly any traffic on the road.  This guy in the lane to the right pulls into the passing lane to overtake a jeep that was in his lane.  He was going a little slower but I slowed down to allow him to pass.  But then he doesn't move back over.  He just hangs out in the left lane in front of me going much slower than I was when I let him over.  I started gaining on him a little expecting him to move back over... Maybe he didn't realize I was there or it slipped his mind or something.  Instead of moving over he literally starts slamming on his brakes trying to get me to rear-end him.  He did this multiple times.  There is literally no one in the lane to the right... Totally empty and the rest of the lanes were barely occupied yet instead of moving over to let me pass, he starts brake checking me.    Utah is so awesome."

They have classes for just about everything. Tons of trades or I would recommend business. I went to college at 27 and am getting close to finishing up an accounting degree and already have an internship (paid) offer from one of the big accounting firms. Even in any of the trades you can make good money and have a career. Even if you have a basic business degree it will give you a leg up in many companies to grow in. SLCC is dirt cheap. Just make sure to look for tuition reimbursements. You can also get the American Opportunities Tax Credit since you are working and get back at least $2000 and up to $2500. If you are frugal in buying books and supplies you can get out of there with paying less than $2,500. I did."
SaltLakeCity,3dzgwn,ehjun,3,Mon Jul 20 20:36:03 2015 UTC,Ill second this.  the community college is really good.  if you qualify for grants to stevens henagers than you can apply those grants to slcc.  when you go to slcc you can also apply for a tuition waiver which means your semester is free without grants. they also have an awesome engineering transfer program to go up to the U if you can put in the time to do it.  a few of my classmates are in the same boat as you.  i think youll find yourself in good company if you go the SLCC route

If you have to take out loans just go to the community college. I could have got it completely free, but I didn't do any Pell grants or anything I just did the tuition reimbursements and tax credits and saved the Pell for the university. After taking classes I have realized that if you want to have a career you really do have to have a degree. I jumped around form many jobs before I went. I would do really well and move up in the company then something will happen and the company downsizes or closes and I am out of a job and have to do it all over again. With a degree you will have a good starting point to build an actual career.  Sorry to hear about the high child support. I have a little boy as well, but luckily have a cheap place to live in and have a decent enough job to barely pay the bills including support as well as allow me to take night classes. I see a light at the end of the tunnel once I am done with college and have a career lined up. I hope you find that soon and can get out of this rut. Best of luck to you."

Next, I shorted the starter relay and it caused the engine to turn over, making me think the relay has gone bad.  The problem for me is finding parts and since it is my only mode of transportation, I was willing to shell out the money to have someone more knowledgeable fix it quickly.

SaltLakeCity,3dvyh4,maurosmane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:33:20 2015 UTC,The national forest is East of what is generally considered the Wasatch mountains. That area is generally called the Uintah mountains (running east-west)while the mountains just East of the valley are called the Wasatch (running north-south). Timpanogos isn't actually in a national forest at all as far as I know but it is in the Wasatch mountain range.  The Wasatch mountain range isn't in the Uintah-Wasatch-Cache national forest at all from what I can tell. Seems pretty confusing to name it like that.

SaltLakeCity,3duwls,nickcakeman,5,Sun Jul 19 18:38:06 2015 UTC,"I went to Myotherapy a while back. Class sizes are quite small, which is a big bonus in a massage school in my opinion. When you have 8 people in your Swedish Massage class, that means typically there are 4 people practicing (on the other 4 people) at a time, so you get a lot of personalized attention from the instructors. I've never been to UCMT, but when I was researching which school to go to, I read that the class sizes were big so it was rare to have an instructor spend much time with you. So I think the small class sizes are a huge benefit.  Also, Myo has expanded their space recently, which means they have some individual massage rooms in their clinic now (instead of sharing a room with 2-3 other students, separated by curtains when you do clinic). That's pretty cool, I wish it had been like that when I attended.  Are you going to be taking day or night classes? I took mostly day classes full time, so I was done in 7 months. My favorite classes were Anatomy and Physiology, Functional Anatomy, and Structural Massage. I loved learning about the body in scientific terms, and Suzanne Dunbar made A&P really easy to digest and understand.  Some cons, at least for me: I felt like the only person in the whole school who didn't believe in chi/prana/life-force, the chakras, homeopathy, and other ""woo"" stuff. A lot of the classes at Myo involved energy work, which I thought was a load of crap, so I had a hard time taking anything those instructors said seriously. Some of those classes were electives, but some were required (Polarity therapy, acupressure, shiatsu come to mind). It felt like everyone around me was really into that sort of thing, which made me feel pretty out of place. If you believe in chi/prana/life-force style stuff, then I think you'll have a better experience in these classes than I did. If you don't believe in it, you can still do well in the classes if you just suspend your disbelief enough to go through the motions with the techniques. It's really not difficult stuff to learn.  I don't know how much the other colleges focus on energy work. I imagine they all deal with it in some way or another.   Despite my issues with a lot of the concepts/modalities taught at Myotherapy, my experience was a positive one and I'm really glad I did it despite not getting into the field afterward. I knew halfway through massage school that I would not pursue a career in massage, but a lot of my classmates were great and passionate people and all of the instructors clearly love their field. It also helped me discover something I really am passionate about: the science of the human body. I just wish massage school hadn't been so expensive.   If you have any more questions, feel free to ask me here or through PM. I like talking about my experiences at Myotherapy."
SaltLakeCity,3duwls,SerialEndosymbiosis,2,Sun Jul 19 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"Such an excellent and helpful response, thank you!  I got that same vibe from Myo when I went to visit. They seemed very well aligned to health and even some kind of spiritual senses. Much like you, I find it kind of silly really. But the more I think about it, when it comes to helping people what you believe doesnt necessarily matter; what the other person feels empowered by is all fine for them.   Im glad to hear that their anatomy and physiology classes are interesting and that the instructors will help you through. I want a school that teaches those two very well, as its incredibly important. The woman who I spoke to there said they have a big course on pathology too, what can you tell me about that? Also, how did they treat posture?  I am leaning towards Healing Mountain and everyone there seems quite friendly. The only thing is that it seems almost too happy there at times. And the whole Crystal Therapy stuff, well again, its just a little silly. But everything else their seems like a wonderful experience."
SaltLakeCity,3duwls,SerialEndosymbiosis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:45:41 2015 UTC,"Myotherapy splits their pathology into three courses, though you take Path II and Path III at the same time (if you are a full-time student), so those two kind of blend into one. I had the same teacher for my Path classes as I had for A&P. The classes were good, though I didn't find them quite as engaging as A&P was. There is a definite massage slant, which of course makes sense. The classes mostly went through various diseases, describing signs, symptoms, and what these diseases mean in the context of massage (whether massage can help, or whether massage is contraindicated, stuff like that).   I went full time, so my terms looked like this: They start you out with A&P for the first term to give you a foundation. Then, for the second term, you take Functional Anatomy, which is in-depth anatomy of the muscles: their attachments, what nerves innervate them, what movements they cause when contracted. You also learn the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction, which I thought was very interesting. You also take Pathology I that term. I think Path I was the one that dealt with skin diseases, but it's been five years since I went to Myo so I could be wrong. Then, the last term you take Path II and Path III.  And, of course, all throughout the three terms you also take the classes that teach you actual massage techniques.  What do you mean by posture? Like, posture of the massage therapist as they work? If so, then posture and body mechanics was a big part of learning the techniques at Myo. They emphasized the need for good body mechanics to keep your own body healthy and not do damage to your joints. They also taught how to use gravity and your own body weight to help with good depth and pressure without murdering your hands and wrists. Part of your grade for the Swedish Massage final was how good your body mechanics were while you massaged someone.  Is Crystal Therapy a big thing at Healing Mountain? I admit I don't know much about Healing Mountain, aside from the fact that they also have small class sizes. We didn't do anything with crystals in any of the classes I took at Myo. In Reflexology, though, the instructor talked about light therapy and that, even if we don't have lights to use on our clients, we were told to ""let the color flow in from your crown chakra and out through your hands into their feet.""   I would offer you the textbooks that I used if you decide to go to Myo, but I just recently donated them to Savers. They probably use newer additions, though."
SaltLakeCity,3duwls,eleshnorn1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"The Pathology course sounds good. I imagine its an important part of massage therapy, where seemingly not necessary, it could be crucial. That is a lot of what I meant by posture, yes. From what I have asked of the other schools they seem to have posture integrated in throughout the course. I just hope its as extensive as that.   It seems like Healing Mountain likes to praise themselves for it a lot. They also have a giftshop where you can buy crystals and stones.   Also thanks for the offer, thats sweet =) I will find out what books I need and maybe I can go to that Savers to see if they are still there."
SaltLakeCity,3duwls,ChaskaJo,5,Mon Jul 20 04:06:14 2015 UTC,"Massage therapist for 9 years, hiring manager for a day spa for over 4 years.   UCMT: Will teach technical aspects quite well, but is very much focused on generating income off of students. Class sizes are large, and if you don't compete for materials and attention you will miss out on subtler aspects of massage therapy. However, the large class sizes will offer you the chance to work on many different types of people and conditions.   Myo: Smaller classes, more focus on energy work, most graduates only master deep tissue and trigger point if they choose to work on it. Those who don't care often do not have a decent enough foundation to progress quickly once they are graduated.  Healing Mountain: Very high quality of personalized attention for students. Most people learn not only massage therapy, but the very passion and essence for it. I have always had good experiences with graduates from this program, however, they have all needed correction on body mechanics and long term self care, and as a result of poor body mechanic training they struggle with deep tissue.  Final notes: Regardless of the school you go to you will face intense competition when you graduate. To deal with this work outside of the class room with a therapist who's experienced, and volunteer regularly. After school it takes about 6 months to fully ""get it"" and begin to develop into a practitioner. Volunteering in school and doing lots of trade will shorten this time and help increase your effectiveness.   Also, you need to learn deep tissue. I run into a lot of people who claim they were told it wasn't necessary; it is necessary. A good deep tissue instructor will teach you proper body mechanics that you will use for all modalities. Furthermore if you do not know how to do deep tissue, but end up doing it in your professional life because of money, you will end up causing unnecessary harm to your clients and to your own body. No matter what school you go to ensure that you get time with the instructor who teaches structural integration (deep tissue)."
SaltLakeCity,3duwls,Reiziger,3,Sun Jul 19 22:33:50 2015 UTC,"I attended UCMT and for the most part I loved it. My class was fairly big, about 28 of us, but like a comment stated it was actually helpful because I had so many different body types to work on. I liked most of the teachers and I feel like I learned a lot. UCMT focuses, i felt, a lot on the clinical side of massage. Russian, Sports, Structural, and pretty intense Anat and Phys. Our text book was actually designed by an anatomy teacher from UoU and it is almost identical to the book they use up there.   I loved learning more about the energetic side of massage. Cranial Sacral, Reflexology, Shiatsu, and acupressure were all my favorite courses. These things just meshed well with me. After reading some of the other comments I probably should have gone to Myo.   One of my biggest complaints about UCMT is due to the fact that they were transitioning a lot of staff during the 7 1/2 months that my class was attending. Because of this we were stuck with having the same 2-3 teachers for everything. I hated this because I felt like we missed out on seeing and learning many different types of techniques. I hear that it is better now.  Clinic was its own adventure. The booths are all separated by curtains. It was a little weird at first but you get over that.   The office staff are amazing and for the most part very helpful. The school provides a lot of help getting employed after school and they offer career services to you long after you've graduated. I was able to have a job before I had graduated because of this amazing asset!   I think the biggest thing is to know what you want to study/focus on. Every school offers something different. I'm glad I went to massage school and I would do it all again! _^ Good luck on your journey!  Edit= Spelling errors. >_<"

SaltLakeCity,3dsw64,fullmetalutes,47,Sun Jul 19 03:28:17 2015 UTC,"Riding more than two abreast is illegal in Utah, and riding double file is illegal if the riders are impeding traffic. Source. See 7th bullet point in State Laws section.        Further, riders must abide by the same rules as auto drivers, which includes minimum speeds. Cars and bicyclists must pull over to let others pass if they cannot maintain a safe speed. Going 15 mph in a 35 would definitely be in violation.         Sharing the road is all well and good, but courtesy goes both ways. IMO, many UT bikers need to get more tickets. I see so, so many of them breaking rules -- endangering themselves and inconveniencing others."
SaltLakeCity,3dsw64,gizamo,8,Sun Jul 19 04:25:27 2015 UTC,"I agree but up east canyon who is going to enforce it? Cops are busy on major roads and such that this is a minor infraction with the law, It's not worth it to enforce to uhp"
SaltLakeCity,3dsw64,gizamo,7,Sun Jul 19 04:39:44 2015 UTC,"Sure.  But, now instead of passing them as they give you the finger, you can yell, ""Learn the law, asshole"".         Or, if you want to be awesome, you can print the law and keep it in your car. Then, you can hand it to them and point out that they were in the wrong. When confronted in person with the law, they often apologize and stop causing that problem. So, you'd be preventing the rest of us from being annoyed by them in the future, and you might save them from getting run down by a crazed road-rager.       If nothing else, now you know that your feelings about the situation are justified by solid legal logic -- which comes in handy when, say, you're venting about this with family, friends or coworkers, and the bike enthusiasts (illogically) get mad at you."

I'm not aware of any required minimum speeds anywhere but freeways. I suspect this would be problematic for farm equipment and construction.  Is there something I don't know here?"
SaltLakeCity,3dsw64,kvigor,6,Sun Jul 19 09:48:30 2015 UTC,"Utah's minimum speed limits are not well defined, but they exist and apply to all UT roadways. Utah code 605.        Many states define them at about 15 or 20 mph below the posted speed; some use 50% of the posted speed; and some require slow moving vehicles to pull to the side if there are more than 10-15 cars tightly packed behind them.        In UT, it is up to the police to decide what is too slow.  Anyway, IME, these rules are not regularly enforced except on freeways and in national parks (where people often slow to a crawl to look at wildlife, waterfalls, or whatever. I think most officers use these rules to ensure the driver is fit to drive (i.e. intoxicated, poor eyesight, young and unlicensed, in labor, etc.)        Regarding farm equipment, some states require farmers to get permits before taking their equipment on major roads or highways. But, the roads around most farms are pretty conducive to the slow moving equipment in that they are relatively flat and straight forevvvvvvveeeeerrrrrrrr, and ever... I've never heard of a farmer getting a ticket (or even a warning) for slowing traffic.         Edit: forgot to explain why UT's law is not well defined."
SaltLakeCity,3dsw64,gizamo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:26:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thank you. I thought there was no required minimum speed unless posted, but clearly not so, even though it is (as you note) poorly defined.  I do note that section 1(a) gives an exemption when ""on a grade"". So it seems that would make it legal to ride a bike up East Canyon at any speed (below the maximum), as long as you do it single file.  (Personally, I avoid it, even though I am an eager cyclist. There's a wonderful period in the spring when the winter gate at East is still closed to traffic but the snow has melted, which makes for cycling nirvana. But once the gate is open and people start towing boats up to the reservoir, the fun is over.)"
SaltLakeCity,3dsw64,megaforce1020,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:10:11 2015 UTC,"The ""against the grade"" clause is for trucks. Think semis hauling heavy loads up I-80 to Park City.        The law recognizes that cyclists cannot keep up with cars, regardless of grade. So, the cyclist-specific additions specify that single file biking is always acceptable, but they are still to let autos pass if they are holding up the show.        Anyway, thanks for being courteous on your bike. Also, as a motorcyclist, I agree and sympathize with your sentiments regarding the boats on reservoir roads. Fun, windy, weeeeeee, ..but, then boats. :(           Cheers."
SaltLakeCity,3dsw64,-73-,9,Sun Jul 19 17:37:42 2015 UTC,I agree that is very irritating.  I bike in a group and we would always do single file because it's safe and courteous. Plus if I wanna scenic drive at 10-15 mph I'll just break out my bike.

SaltLakeCity,3dsw64,ajfa,10,Sun Jul 19 04:29:09 2015 UTC,"Well, it takes all types. Plenty of cyclists in the valley are not elitist in the least, commute to work and know how to share with cars. In fact, I'd say there are way more cyclists than there used to be, and SLC is better off for it (more bike commuting == less auto traffic, too!)  Honestly what's going on here is the demographic of the recreational cyclist who does a group ride in Emigration Canyon and East Canyon. Between the Foothill-area SLC and the Park City riders, these are going to be the biggest assholes with the nicest frames."
SaltLakeCity,3dsw64,megaforce1020,3,Sun Jul 19 04:43:31 2015 UTC,Yeah you are right  AJFA.  SLC is much better for biking now than ever before. But there are alot of bikers who think are so much better than others that they don't realize bike never wins against anything and yet they do stupid irritating stuff to drivers like ride 3 wide.
SaltLakeCity,3dsw64,ajfa,5,Sun Jul 19 05:03:57 2015 UTC,"Not defending them in the least -- there are two types:   the ""critical mass"" types who deliberately try to flaunt the bike's supremacy over the car  novice recreational cyclists who don't bike in traffic enough to understand what will get them killed   Over the years I've seen less of the first and more of the second... I guess it's a cheap shot to just say ""argh, they're all rich assholes"", really they're the cycling equivalent of a teenage driver with a brand new car."

It can be scary at first but you get used to it -- and cars get used to you. 3 days a week from Sandy to the U, that's the majority of my exercise.  I don't do it much in the winter, but that's what ski season is for :)  The important thing is to not be an asshole. Cars are bigger than you, bike lanes and shoulders exist for a reason. There are some places (crossing I-80 around Brickyard) where it's going to be dangerous and you need to make your presence known just to get across, but it's always better to cycle defensively. I see so many novice cyclists get offended whenever a car encroaches on ""their space"" and do dangerous stuff... sad really."

I live near Flat Iron Mesa park (north Sandy, just south of Ft Union), so to get to the U is a 13 mile straight shot. It's well paved, the shoulder is huge in most places, it's a dream. It takes me about 45 minutes, and burns 1300 calories :)  The only sketchy areas are around Ft Union itself, and Brickyard (crossing I-80).

But on beautiful weekends there are a lot more cars out and the relationship of cyclists, somewhat suffering up the hill, can become impatient with someone who is pressing a pedal. Sometimes it feels safer in groups to spread out because while there are people like you, there are people who are entertained by speeding quickly near cyclists. All road cyclists have experienced near death by someone whizzing by them or being reckless. At the same time, sharing the road has to go both ways and cyclists, especially on a road like East Canyon, need to share the road with other people enjoying a beautiful day in their car."

I remember one day a car drove so close to me that I punched the car. The driver got out and started yelling at me, and I told him he was that close to my car that I could punch it.. Well it's his own fault. Taking up three cyclists abreast though is arrogant and disrespectful to another human.  I used to participate in Thursday night critical mass.. Same idea awareness toward sharing the road.. Well damn arrogant people on their bikes feeling so superior and a group to defend them would go extra slow at the tail end of the group. this would slow down traffic on major streets like 400 south or 700 east.

Some of these will invariably be novices or hard-core roadies with a chip on their shoulder. But I agree, 3-wide is excessive and dangerous on those switchbacks.

SaltLakeCity,3dtc3f,lordxi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:33:46 2015 UTC,I got the pulled pork at the Ogden location recently. I was disappointed.
SaltLakeCity,3dtc3f,CrimsonSmear,2,Sun Jul 19 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"Pig in a Jelly Jar in general is extremely disappointing.  I've never had worse baked beans (and for it being one of their 'signature' side dishes, that's pretty sad) and their sandwiches were dry as hell."
SaltLakeCity,3dtc3f,CatLadyLacquerista,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got beans with my pulled pork and it should have been served with a spoon because it was so soupy. The ratio of beans to other ingredients was pretty bad too. If I had to guess the composition, it seemed like it was 50% liquid, 25% beans, and 25% texture vegetables.  As far as the sandwich goes, the pulled pork itself was fine, but they also had 'raw slaw' on it, which was basically chopped white cabbage, and hand-sliced pickles that were so thick that they threw off the balance of the rest of the sandwich.  Also, happy cake day."
SaltLakeCity,3dtc3f,CrimsonSmear,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:20 2015 UTC,"omg cake day!  Thank you, I didn't even notice!  We had a pulled pork sandwich and some kinda burger, and an alcoholic beverage.  They were all terrible.  Kind of a bummer."

SaltLakeCity,3dt3l6,lizkasosiska,3,Sun Jul 19 15:41:13 2015 UTC,It's at the Railroad Museum on 24th and Wall.  They moved it from Standford in 2010

SaltLakeCity,3dr8oq,jortr0n,2,Sat Jul 18 23:14:48 2015 UTC,"No, about finding the girl dead. News stations listen to police dispatch, and they heard about a dead body, and reported it before her parents knew. Personally, I think the parents should know before the rest of the world."
SaltLakeCity,3dr8oq,SackOfHellNo,7,Sat Jul 18 23:16:07 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't be accurate. Parents knew she was missing, PD found her around 2AM. News didn't break until dawn.

SaltLakeCity,3dqgs3,Slcyuppie,2,Sat Jul 18 13:33:46 2015 UTC,"Like, why keep making useless fucking bike lanes? And downtown parking."
SaltLakeCity,3dqgs3,mh40sw,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:14:12 2015 UTC,"The last thing I would call bike lanes would be ""useless"".  They are a simple and relatively inexpensive solution to our traffic and smog problem by encouraging more people to commute on bikes. Whenever I ride my bike I feel 100 times safer in a bike lane."
SaltLakeCity,3dqgs3,st00ps,2,Sat Jul 18 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"ride bike in street: ""fucking cocksucking bikers blocking traffic!"" ride bike in bike lane: ""fucking cocksucking bike lanes!"""
SaltLakeCity,3dqgs3,IgnacioLopes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:24:51 2015 UTC,"I would love protected bike lanes if they didn't affect parking but damn, you lose so many parking spaces with those lanes."
SaltLakeCity,3dqgs3,nervousnedflanders,2,Sat Jul 18 22:22:52 2015 UTC,That is probably a secondary purpose. Reduce parking accessibility makes biking more attractive.
SaltLakeCity,3dqgs3,HierarchofSealand,0,Sat Jul 18 23:38:40 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's not cool. I don't want to be forced to have to ride a bike."
SaltLakeCity,3dqgs3,nervousnedflanders,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:16:28 2015 UTC,Parking. My understanding is that the city master plan dictates that businesses cannot have parking for each and every employee (that the average employee could possibly afford).  Can you explain/sell why this is a good policy from a worker's / employer's  self interest?
SaltLakeCity,3dqgs3,bryanut,2,Sat Jul 18 22:27:52 2015 UTC,"Answer: it is not a policy built directly for employers/employees. It is a policy designed to restrict parking to increase alternative commuting, and reduce unnecessary miles driven."
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,eleshnorn1,72,Fri Jul 17 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"If you are the event organizer, would you mind emailing me at webmaster@fox13now.com? We are looking into perhaps covering this protest and would love a point of contact. My name's Mark and I work for FOX 13's website."

I passed your info along to the coordinator and told her to mention my reddit name to you. She is also the admin for the Facebook page DXE SLC lagoon protest, and can be contacted through that source as well. Thank you so much for your interest it would mean a lot to the cause if we could get more attention!"
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,wordofgreen,14,Sat Jul 18 00:51:06 2015 UTC,"For sure. I'm not the one who makes the call, but I've passed the details along to our desk/management and will follow up tomorrow, as I happen to work weekends. I appreciate you sending my details along, as having a name and phone number makes following a potential story a lot easier on our end. Thanks again!  Edit: The organizer sent me a press release with the contact info. Thanks so much!"
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,darthV8R,34,Sat Jul 18 01:00:05 2015 UTC,"Right on. Here's the thing: People would still ride the train, animals or not. In fact, I'd probably want to ride it even more without the sad animals. Trains are awesome.  Oh here's an idea: Re-invent it as a wild west themed ride. You could have train robbers and everything. People would love it.  Call me up. I'll consult on it."
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,ratbastid,4,Sat Jul 18 04:09:36 2015 UTC,"I quit riding that train when I was like 12 (which would make it 1986) because the animals made me so sad.  Besides, they'd just put in Colossus, and rumor was some kid lost his arms on it by holding them above his head on the second loop, so I obviously had to try to do that over and over all day."
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,J-MRP,18,Sat Jul 18 17:44:35 2015 UTC,Snapped a pic when I saw it. This was last summer. My wife and I were pretty shocked at the conditions they seemed to be in.
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,ChronicDreamer7,6,Sat Jul 18 02:48:02 2015 UTC,Yeah it's really heart breaking to see them trapped like that.
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,ekul_reklawyks,12,Sat Jul 18 05:11:37 2015 UTC,I was there on Tuesday with my little cousins and everyone got depressed after riding the train. I definitely do not plan on going back until they change this situation. Wish I could make it to the protest..
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,ekul_reklawyks,23,Sat Jul 18 05:33:11 2015 UTC,"Oh good! I'm new to the area and went there on Wednesday, not knowing about the animals. It was horrific when we went through! I left there ready to make some calls and report them. I'm unable to attend the protest but I would love to help if I can. Please keep us updated here!"
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,wambrita,8,Fri Jul 17 23:21:27 2015 UTC,"For sure I'll do a follow up post after the protest.   We're going to keep pushing until lagoon takes responsibility for the harm they're causing, and if you have facebook please follow the event page for future protests and DXE actions."
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,ekul_reklawyks,2,Sat Jul 18 00:44:11 2015 UTC,Done!
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,yodamuppet,4,Sat Jul 18 04:42:38 2015 UTC,"I have rightfully poisoned my kids against that ride. When we went to lagoon for my husband's work function, he got upset when I told him no, we are not going I that ride.   It needs to get shut down."
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,rabid_briefcase,5,Fri Jul 17 23:30:51 2015 UTC,Agreed. I was absolutely disgusted when I got off the ride. Those poor animals.
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,tokinmoenugz,14,Fri Jul 17 23:46:07 2015 UTC,"Last time I was at Lagoon, some 10 years ago, I called the ASPCA to report what I saw. Nothing happened. Still disappointed."
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,guydog,5,Fri Jul 17 23:37:23 2015 UTC,Do something with us tomorrow!! If enough people support these efforts we can rescue the animals.
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,dondizzle,9,Sat Jul 18 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting protest, but at the wrong place and thinking too small.  The park meets federal standards and there isn't a financial reason for them to change.   If you protest at Lagoon, at best (but unlikely) you get a single zoo to change their ways.  If you instead focus on getting the rules changed at the federal level by joining up with other organizations, you can get all the parks in the nation changed."
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,J-MRP,14,Sat Jul 18 05:33:39 2015 UTC,"This is actually part of DXE which is a global organization working to establish animal rights and equality. Lagoon may be a small thing but effecting change at the small levels creates better successes in the future.   Each life that's saved is a win!  Also you'll be happy to know there are many people who are a part of the DXE that work to bring about change through government action, societal values and awareness campaigns, such as the lagoon protest. All of these different actions are intrinsic for their own progress and vital to support each other."

SaltLakeCity,3do8if,DiggingNoMore,10,Sat Jul 18 00:13:21 2015 UTC,"It's the steam train that runs around the park; you only see the animals if you're riding the train.  If you've ever had to wait for a train to pass before getting on or off Tidal Wave, that's the one."
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,jsucese,6,Sat Jul 18 00:29:14 2015 UTC,You can see a few by the one end of the sky ride and you can see the tigers on the path to Pioneer Village.
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,TaddWinter,2,Sat Jul 18 03:02:40 2015 UTC,There is also a walking path that goes right by the animals and is outside of the park.   Can't join the protest but I would if I was available. Get them out of there!
SaltLakeCity,3do8if,xn--seorblanco-u9a,12,Sat Jul 18 04:16:32 2015 UTC,"As weird as it sounds that's kind of the point. A lot of people don't even know the animals exist. You can see them when you go on the train ride but the conditions these animals are in deplorable. Lagoon is a theme park, utah has a zoo."

I guess what Sugarhouse has going for it is a name (as opposed to street coordinates), and proximity to the freeway (if you don't work downtown).   Prices there are ridiculous: you'll pay more for a bungalow in Sugarhouse than something around 9th and 9th or Harvard/Yale! In fact, you can get a huge, gorgeous house in Olympus Cove or the upper Avenues for $100k more than your retrofitted starter home in Sugarhouse!  And there are other suburbs that are much less sleepy than West Jordan. In my neighborhood in north Sandy, neighbors are out on the street all the time. Only one of my 9 adjacent neighbors is LDS, and they're awesome. I can walk to Sunset Coffee, the gym, and a nice large park, which is all I need. I'm also 5 minutes from LCC/BCC, and have a huge house with views that I could never get downtown (even if I could afford it). I bike 13 miles to work -- a pleasant workout but not impossible. If my friends are hitting Beer Hive or Bayou downtown, I do have to drive, but that's 15 minutes with no traffic -- hardly a problem (and note, you'd have to drive downtown from 9th and 9th, 15th and 15th and Sugarhouse too!)."

Some of the little running paths have rocks with holes drilled in them, some crazy mountain man sprang out of the bushes ones and just started explaining how they were left over from a process of fracturing the rocks for transport; wherein a line of holes are bored in a rock face and wooden steaks are driven in. The steaks are then soaked in water until they swell up and make a reasonably clean break.

SaltLakeCity,3dk9yf,wyldcrater,12,Fri Jul 17 05:09:30 2015 UTC,"Short answer: no.  Long answer: The draw Salt Lake and all major surrounding area provides for sports teams cannot economically sustain any major franchise.   The NFL will never have a team here in Utah, largely due to market draw being split. When you combine the facts that we are geographically between two of the most recently successful teams in the league and one of the most celebrated franchises in NFL history, with the fact that even the smallest current stadium in the NFL  (Qualcomm Stadium) still holds almost a huge 2% of our entire states population. (For reference, the Arizona Cardinals stadium doesn't even hold 1% of Arizona's population) it's clear the NFL will never make enough revenue from this market while so many people here are already well established fans of other franchises.  MLB would be possible but only if they promoted the Bees to the majors. If they brought in a preexisting MLB team into Salt Lake, I cannot imagine the Bees would be pleased as they could easily see a drop in ticket and merchandise sales. Consider that the Bees had an average attendance of 6,722 people per game while all MLB stadiums average over 17,000. There is no way the Salt Lake Bees can increase their average ticket sales per game by more than 60%.  With very similar conditions as the MLB, the NHL could find a home in Salt Lake. However, when 18 of 30 NHL teams are losing money in a single season 2010-2011, expansion absolutely will not happen.  I may have been working all summer on my thesis...

SaltLakeCity,3disvd,dmarie229,5,Thu Jul 16 16:44:28 2015 UTC,"OK, so I can kind of see where they are coming from. First off, I have solar panels and am net metered - not in Kaysville, but in Provo.  I don't know the books behind these companies, but it's not hard to imagine what might happen if, theoretically, everyone switched to net metering. First, you need to make sure you understand the basics of how net metering works. When you have solar panels, you don't use the electricity they generate directly. Instead you use electricity from the grid, just like everyone else. At the same time, your solar panels are pushing electricity in to the grid as well.   I am charged for the net difference between what I put in and what I took out. Hence, ""net metering"".   If you've ever watched a mechanical electric meter, it has a little wheel that spins as you use electricity. The faster it spins, the more you're using. When my A/C turns off I can actually watch it slow down and start spinning in the opposite direction, which is how I end up with negative usage for the month.  What solar is good at is reducing demand during peak times. A/C is probably one of the biggest draws of electricity for most residential users. A/C is most needed during the day when it's hot out. That's also when solar is producing the most.   However, solar produces nothing at night. During those times, I still need some other source of electricity. Even in a perfectly balanced system (where you produce exactly what you use on a monthly basis), you would have to overproduce during the day to cover the lack of production at night.   With that in mind, it's easy to see that if everyone had solar, we run in to problems. Everyone produces tons of electricity during the day and nothing at night. However, there is still demand at night - so where does that come from?  It has to come from other sources and someone has to pay for it.   There are fixed costs to the system and it sounds like the power companies are trying to figure out how to cover those when some users are washing out their bill or even generating a credit*. Right now the way they might try to do it would be to increase the rate - but that doesn't affect solar users at all. If the rate goes up, my credit goes up, since it's the same price. It would only affect non solar users. I think that's what they are getting at when they say non solar users would subsidize the solar users.  I don't imagine everyone will switch to solar, however. Solar should be able to offset increased demands which means they would have to build less infrastructure in the future. I can see how, in the present, it can be a bit disconcerting, however, when they aren't facing those costs right now. It would be interesting to see how solar over production is growing compared to demand. That's one piece we don't see with the way the meters work - There's no way to see how much electricity is actually needed because the solar systems just give you the difference. Solar could reach a point where it would cause a major problem if everyone shut off their panels because the grid might not be able to handle the demand on it's own.   *Keep in mind that, just like you have to overproduce during the day to cover costs at night, you also have to overproduce in the spring and fall to cover high usage in summer and low productivity in winter. Ideally you'd run a $0 balance over the year. My net metering cancels out any accrued credit once per year - I think in March or April."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,overthemountain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:30:18 2015 UTC,"Great post.  I keep hearing people get fired up about utility companies trying to figure out a system to manage solar growth, and most of these people don't seem to understand that the grid is essential to making it work.  Until we can figure out a better way to store power we'll always need a grid, and someone has to pay for and manage it.  When you pay the power company you're paying just as much for the infrastructure as you are for the actual power generation."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,kolomana,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:16:42 2015 UTC,Comprehensive and well said. I can absolutely see the issues they're encountering. Especially with solar becoming more popular.
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,wtmh,4,Fri Jul 17 14:31:36 2015 UTC,"I live in Kaysville, and this has been irking a few of us.  Personally, I don't own solar panels.  But I do breathe the air around here, and anything that reduces air pollution seems like a good idea to me, especially if I don't have to pay anything extra.  The reason behind suspending net metering for new customers (from the utilities spokesman, anyway) is that ""non-solar customers are subsidizing others who put solar panels on their roofs.""  I've been working hard to see how this might be possible, but it just doesn't make sense.  If my neighbor puts a massive solar array on his roof, my bill doesn't change one whit.  And if the power company decides to raise rates because they have to do more work to keep the grid operational, then my solar-producing neighbor pays more as well when he draws from the grid during the night."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,poncelet,6,Thu Jul 16 17:41:26 2015 UTC,"Your neighbor is still connected to the grid, though.  And the pricing model that power companies have been using to ensure that they're covering the astronomical fixed costs of delivering electricity didn't include the possibility that they would be delivering to households that only draw a fraction of the estimated average use.  In other words, the cost of building out the infrastructure is baked into the kwh price.  If enough consumers drop below a minimum use, then they're not paying enough to cover the investment that was undertaken to get their house on the grid.  It's a tricky problem that utilities are going to have to solve soon, but I'm not sure that solar customers are going to like whatever solution they come up with.   If my neighbor puts a massive solar array on his roof, my bill doesn't change one whit. And if the power company decides to raise rates because they have to do more work to keep the grid operational   This right here is how you subsidize your solar-powered neighbor.  When rates rise to cover the fixed costs no longer paid by solar customers, everyone pays more.  There isn't a mechanism, yet, that allows utilities to charge solar customers more than everyone else."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,agilla,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:45:45 2015 UTC,"I object to the language of the power company here.  I am no more subsidizing the use of a solar panel system by paying for power than I am subsidizing Kellogs when the guy in line in front of me uses a coupon to buy his corn flakes.  I readily admit that there will be additional labor required to handle the growth of home power generation, and revenues decline when people consume less power.  But the power company wants me to believe that I'm paying for more than I use.  And I'm not.  They can request a rate change to cover any change in consumer behavior, from installing LED light bulbs to using high-efficiency furnaces, to generating solar power.  But it is disingenuous to try to paint legally-mandated net metering agreements as unfair subsidies paid by those of us who haven't installed solar panels."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,poncelet,3,Thu Jul 16 19:22:34 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is not that non solar users are currently subsidizing solar users, but that to be sustainable, they will have to start. Basically they are saying that there is a fixed cost to provide power in general but their current net metering agreements allow solar users to bypass all costs.   Providing more electricity to the grid doesn't do the power company much good if no one is using that extra power, and it doesn't lower their fixed costs at all. What it could do is offset increased demands that would have required them to build out more infrastructure. But that's a future cost savings and doesn't affect current economic issues.  What they would need to do is change how they charge for electricity - a flat connection fee plus a usage fee. The connection fee should be enough to cover fixed costs and the usage fee would cover variable costs. It sounds like right now it's all usage based only."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,overthemountain,0,Thu Jul 16 19:56:40 2015 UTC,So they are afraid solar will put the power companies out of business or raise the rates too high for the people not using solar? Lame excuse to me.
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,F-That,6,Thu Jul 16 19:02:26 2015 UTC,"Have you ever looked at the financials of a large-scale energy producer?  It's complicated as all hell.  I wouldn't be so quick to judge it as lame or not.  I feel like some people are going to try to frame this as an environmentalist vs. earth-raping megacorporation.  I think that's probably wrong on several levels.  For the record, I consider myself an environmentalist, I take the evil UTA to work, I'll get some PV panels on my roof one day when I get around to it, etc.  But I absolutely understand where the utility is coming from here.  Something will need to change in how they provide electricity to solar customers, because solar is not going away, and they're going to have to deal with the issues raised by it somehow."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,agilla,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:06:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe they can convert their business model to installing and maintaining solar systems for customers? Rent-to-own like some of the other businesses do.   My electric bill in Kaysville last month was $21. Not enough for me to worry about because I try to conserve using LED's and keeping my temperature regulated, but if I put solar on my home and they still wanted to charge me for a service I no longer use, I would be pissed also. Especially if I am giving them my extra power to sell to their other customers."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,F-That,5,Thu Jul 16 19:26:39 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that even with solar, you are still using the grid. The way net metering works is that you still use the grid normally but your solar panels put electricity in while you take electricity out. You probably don't use any of the electricity you generated - it goes in to the grid and is used elsewhere.   There is a convenience factor - for example, I like to have lights on at night when the sun isn't providing any electricity via solar panels at all."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,overthemountain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:07:41 2015 UTC,"I thought you had a closet full of batteries and stored your own energy and when they were full, you then fed the grid. I guess that would be even more net zero, but cost a lot more."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,F-That,4,Thu Jul 16 20:16:51 2015 UTC,"That is an option, but that's going off the grid. The battery systems currently are very expensive and from what I've heard, have issues on their own. Tesla's power wall is an intriguing (but currently not economically viable) alternative. I imagine that in 5-10 years it could be a good option and I could look at going completely off the electric grid.  A good solar system, after incentives, probably costs like $10-25k depending on size and a battery system would probably add another $10-20k on top of that."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,overthemountain,2,Thu Jul 16 20:33:17 2015 UTC,"I think this is a decent area to start the solution search.  If the utility is able to incorporate the increase of distributed solar production into their business model, it'd probably go a long way."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,agilla,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:25:25 2015 UTC,"I know there was some noise being made about how some solar users are building arrays larger than what they actually need because at the moment power companies are buying the power back at retail rate.  What they should be doing instead is determine what the actual cost of doing business is, separate it from kwh, and bill all users connected to the grid this rate.  Additionally, for solar users they should be buying the power back not at full retail rate but at some other reduced rate.  I love solar, I love all renewable forms of energy and energy independence.  I'm conflicted on net metering though and do believe those connected to the grid need to help pay for the grid."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,overthemountain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think buying the power back at retail rate is a problem. I mean, if I pay the base cost, plus I put back as much as I take, why should I still be paying for usage?  Provo charges all users a connection fee - it's only like $6/mo, though. I don't know where Kaysville is getting their $46/user number from, that sounds really high. That's at least $350k/mo ($46 x 7,524 households as of 2010 census). That would, however, assume that they sell electricity at cost, which I imagine is not the case. I mean, I don't think it's unfair to assume that they can reliably operate at some fraction of their total capacity."
SaltLakeCity,3disvd,ButchDeal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:00:33 2015 UTC,"The way I rationalize the buy back cost is like taking my used clothes to Plato's Closet. The $80 jeans I bought new will maybe net me $8 and they in turn resell them for $30 as a cost of doing business but hey, I get $8 for pants I wasn't going to use anyway. RMP has an admin fee of around $6 I believe? Idk I'm on autopay so it doesn't cross my mind. Either way, if that $6 is too low to cover overhead they need to figure their business out and fast."

So one day, SLC will very likely be under water unless people undertake a massive project to build a diversion channel to stop the lake from growing again.  The next fill won't be as high as the last one due to the wash out at red rock pass, but it will eventually fill to the ""Provo Level"" which would still put the wells fargo building (tallest building in SLC) under water by about 140 feet. In reality, they probably would create a diversion project if the climate changes to the point that the lake begins swelling again (the old pumps built due to the '83 flood couldn't handle the volume).   It would be really cool to see how future people will handle it. SLC may be abandoned by then anyway. Utah as an state entity likely won't exist. Maybe people will have resettled on the back of the wasatch and will be content to let the lake rise with Heber or Park City as the area's major city."

DOPE. but yeah, when lake bonneville returns (as it has done 18 times in the last million or so years) it will help ships navigate away from the  ancient, drowned, buildings (as the water level won't be at the old 700 foot level due to the wash out at red rock pass)."

If we're going to do it, put a bunch high towers and giant vents mounted on the La Sal mountains, with platforms redirecting an enormous volume of high altitude air down into the valley. Since the mine has already made the mountains unsightly, might as well stack some useful ugliness on top.  It would need to be an enormous facility many miles across in order to redirect and inject enough air to break up a valley-wide inversion.  It would be a massive project, but given a big enough disturbance in the right direction to break the cap, the turbulence could end a valley-wide inversion."

But you asked, so let's be serious... after all why not?  The mountains dwarf everything here. You could rebuild the 2717 ft tall Burj Khalifa in Salt Lake -- it would look enormous compared to the rest of downtown, and rise well above Ensign peak, but it would still feel smaller than the Wasatch mountains rising high in the east. Also, it's well beyond the budget of our midsize city.   The goal should also be to have a skyline that doesn't yell out ""blah"", like Denver or LA. Iconic buildings, like the Sears tower in Chicago, the John Hancock tower in Chicago, or the Columbia Seafirst tower in Seattle, are what we should go for. I'm partial to spires -- I think skyscrapers should not have any particular religious significance but we want something that would harmonize with the Salt Lake temple, the tower of City Hall and the dome of the capitol. Philadelphia and Atlanta have pretty nice skylines with pyramidal spire-heavy buildings.   Rather than just another office tower, one could build a high end urban condo tower like Jeanne Gang's Aqua building in Chicago. Perhaps something that combines residential and office space? Ideally, I'd want to see a building that provides mixed-use capability, and symbolizes the contrasts we see in Utah: the pious LDS culture vs opportunistic intermountain west, the rocky mountains meeting the great basin, i.e. mountains meeting desert. Perhaps a lower-elevation slanted buildings, like a more vertical design similar to the city library, would fit the bill in SLC?

Business owners are highly interested, and business owners (or their hirelings) attend the meetings and discuss policy. Because they are actually present in the meetings, and they are actually involved in discussion, they tend to get policies they want.  People who don't invest the time in the political process tend not to get what they want because they seldom raise their voices and never attend meetings.

SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,Jubguy3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:47:03 2015 UTC,Yep and I explained that the donor was probably anonymous.  Just because gay marriages are now normalised (all just marriage) doesn't change the views the country has had for years and years regarding anonymity of donors and biological parents of adoptive children.  Remember the case from last August where a teen mother from Kearns left her newborn in a trash can because she didn't want her parents to know she was pregnant?  After that there was a push to educate the public about Safe Haven laws which allow bio parents to keep their anonymity when dropping their newborn off in a safe place like a hospital.  There are very good reasons bio parents aren't listed.
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,reddittatertot,2,Thu Jul 16 21:20:02 2015 UTC,THEN YOU JUST LEAVE THE SPOT EMPTY
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,Jubguy3,0,Thu Jul 16 21:35:17 2015 UTC,"Look, I think the greater point here is that gay couples just want to be treated like everyone else.  That was the victory they just had.  Their entire point was, nothing needs to change, we're just like everyone else.  So there is a long long history of birth certificates being legal documents, not medical ones.  It establishes who their parents are.  That is used for child support purposes, other legal reasons.  Also, it's a matter of legitimacy.  Parents who adopt or use assisted reproduction may not want their kid to know in some cases that they're not their ""real"" parent.  Because they are their real parent.  Those parents wrestle with how to break that information to their child, if at all.  They want to be able to address it with their child on their own schedule rather than have it be public information.  There is (undeservedly) a stigma with adoption and assisted reproduction.  There are seriously so many reasons why the option doesn't even exist to fill in that extra space.  What has the normalising of gay marriage done to change any of that?  They wanted to be treated like everyone else, and everyone else had already deemed that information irrelevant for purposes of a birth certificate.  EDIT: Also, in the extremely rare case where a biological parent is happy to be identified, there are things called ""open adoptions"".  Sometimes they are even as generous as to have regular visits.  This is a significant, significant minority of cases as most parents want their child to be treated as their ""normal"" child and not have any evidence of their adoption/non-natural conception until they choose to handle it with their child as they wish."
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,reddittatertot,2,Thu Jul 16 21:48:25 2015 UTC,oh my god if they dont want their child to know they can just decline but for medical and legal purposes they can record all four names if you have an issue with it you just dont write anything its that simple
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,Jubguy3,0,Thu Jul 16 21:55:29 2015 UTC,"So all gay parents for the rest of time should be relegated to ""legal parent"" status with blank biological parent lines, while the majority of heterosexual couples can be ""biological parents"".  It's ever more irrelevant to distinguish the 2 as dna testing improves."
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,reddittatertot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:20:34 2015 UTC,you cant just go and whoop dee doo dna test someone. recording the data at birth will simplify everything in the future. and if gay parents want to list the bio parent if known (probably?) they can. and saying that the majority of hetero couples can be bio parents isnt going to fix the fact that gay couples cant have children. the hetero nonadopting couples are listed twice. this idea is literally all inclusive and yet you have managed to complain about it. if the state wants to record bio parent for medical reasons they could now distinguish it from the people who are raising the child. boy you are special
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,Jubguy3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:33:49 2015 UTC,"Lol yes people can whoop dee doo dna test themselves any time they want.  This is a pointless argument as we fundamentally see this differently.  I worked for a long time with adoptive parents.  If you don't understand why adoptive parents wouldn't want there to even be the option of them not being identified as something besides just a plain ""parent"", then I can't help you.  As I said, the routes for identifying biological parents already exist through open adoptions.  There's no need to now change the whole system because gay parents have been thrown into the mix.  Changing the whole system just for them is completely unnecessary, especially when there were already adoptive and assisted reproduction parents in the past that didn't need the special treatment you are arguing for.  I won't be responding further."
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,reddittatertot,2,Fri Jul 17 01:01:14 2015 UTC,"In my mind it makes more sense to list only biological parents on the original birth certificate, and the establish legal guardianship separately. Or else a way to indicate biological vs. non-biological parents. My train of thought is that regardless of hetero vs homo relationships biology is important for the sake of medical history."
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,IrishLadd,5,Thu Jul 16 05:08:14 2015 UTC,"The thing is, a birth certificate IS for legal reasons. It allows you to set up social security, is part of legal state/county records, etc. if I used a sperm donor with my wife, I would not be the biological parent but would be on the birth certificate. It isn't a medical document at all."
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,gypsysoulrocker,2,Thu Jul 16 13:00:40 2015 UTC,"Why not both? The couple are the ones raising the child so not having their name on the certificate makes a headache for them, and not having the biological names on the certificate makes a headache for ancestry and medical concerns. It's literally just writing four names on a sheet so it's not difficult. The reason the state was refusing is because they were trying to make their final jabs at gay and lesbian couples. A form with 2 lines (each with two names) with the biological names on one line and the custody names on the other line would solve a whole range of issues from LGBT couples to adopted children. And it can be used for straight non adopting couples because you can just write the same name twice. The only reason the state refuses to do this is because they have ingrained homophobia and they are backwards and only recognize a family with such high criteria (are they same race? One mom one dad? No issues? Only then) that you'd think they are neonazis. This is their final chance to wave their dick of ""family values and incredible hatred"".  This is a non issue but the state wants it to be one."
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,Jubguy3,5,Thu Jul 16 05:16:41 2015 UTC,"I'm with you about having two sets of names. I honestly think that's a great idea regardless of the sexual orientation of the parents because it would allow for tracking biology and legal parenthood.  Totally agree that the state is being completely boneheaded about this. Now we have a form that will only track legal parentage in some cases, which would make it really difficult if the child at some point in the future wanted to look up biological parents. Essentially what we have is a win-lose situation... And that is not ideal (Micheal Scott anyone?)."
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,IrishLadd,6,Thu Jul 16 13:10:35 2015 UTC,I would be in favor of listing biological parents on birth certificates but I think all married couples should be treated the same. It doesn't really make sense to me to list the non biological father as the father in assisted reproductive cases either.  It sounds like this is an area that is due for an overhaul. Establish biological parents for record keeping and legal guardianship separately. Right now they are one and the same which doesn't work in cases like these.
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,overthemountain,2,Thu Jul 16 03:18:43 2015 UTC,"I think you might be mis-characterizing the role that birth certificates play.   They are not intended to be biological or medical documents, they are legal (and social history) tools. I think it is perfectly correct that this baby's legally and socially recognized parents should be on the certificate."
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,Courtlandt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:06:19 2015 UTC,"A birth certificate documents a child's birth. A child has a biological set of parents - a mother and a father. It makes sense that it would be documented on a birth certificate.   The intent of a birth certificate probably varies quite a bit based on who and when you asked. You mentioned using them as a legal tool. If a baby is born to foreign parents biologically on foreign soil but adopted to American parents whoa re listed on the birth certificate as the parents, is the baby an American citizen? This ""legal tool"" is now potentially creating a legal mess.  All children born to American citizens can generally claim birthright citizenship. I'm not sure if they should or shouldn't or if there is a right or wrong answer, just pointing out that there are discrepancies that we'd have to address. It can create odd citizenship issues.  This is why I suggested that we overhaul this system. I think both pieces of data are important - who are the biological parents and who are the legally responsible guardians? They may often be one and the same but in some cases they may be very different."
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,overthemountain,2,Thu Jul 16 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know enough about the nature of birth certificates. Are they both a medical and legal document, or just a legal document? Are they there as legal evidence of who is caring for the child, or who provided D.N.A. for the child? I would ask: if a baby is born to an arrangement in which the mother will immediately give up the baby for adoption, then will she still put her name on the birth certificate? Or will her adoptive parents put their names on the birth certificate? If a woman becomes pregnant by one man, breaks up with him, but then quickly meets and marries another man and then gives birth and the baby daddy wants nothing to do with the baby, then should the step father put his name on the birth certificate? If so, then the other mother should put her name on the birth certificate. If not then I guess I would like to know the importance of why we SHOULDN'T put guardians of children who aren't that child's parents on a birth certificate. Obviously there is no importance, otherwise they would have lost in court."
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,BoozeoisPig,2,Thu Jul 16 04:33:07 2015 UTC,They are primarily an identification document.
SaltLakeCity,3dfsud,meggyver,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:57:04 2015 UTC,"From the article:   Angie and Kami Roe of West Jordan said in their lawsuit on the issue that the state should treat wedded lesbian couples the same as heterosexual couples who use sperm donors to have children. State law automatically recognizes a husband who agrees to assisted reproduction as a father, but the Utah attorney general's office contended that doesn't extend to same-sex couples because child bearing is legally different from marriage.   So it does look like non biologically related men are put on the birth certificate in those kinds of situations."

SaltLakeCity,3de034,IgnacioLopes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:32:41 2015 UTC,"Where is the proof?    If all we were going on was the word of Beau Babka I would say this is a valid question, but all of the owners in the area were already saying these things. Source   Larsen says they were never told their businesses were being considered for removal in the overall plans. Mayor Kelvyn Cullimore has denied that there ever was a removal question. The business owners believe that the mayor’s unwillingness to be forthright with them, compounded by the treatment they have received from Cottonwood Heights police, has produced an unfriendly relationship between the business owners and the city.  Asking Larsen if he would have been ok with selling his building and relocating within the new project he says, “It would be hard to leave this location, but we would like to have a working relationship with whoever moves in.” We posed the same question of Canyon Inn owner Jim Stojack, who said he wouldn’t have had any problem had the developer or the city come to him to ask about buying out his property for a market-value price. Instead, the Canyon Inn and neighboring 7-Eleven business have seen significant declines in sales because of a police presence in the area that they describe as “oppressive.”  For nearly two years, CHPD and UHP positioned officers in the parking lots of both the 7-Eleven and the Canyon Inn, and along Wasatch Boulevard, pulling over customers suspected of drinking and driving. Many motorists who blew below the legal .08 limit received DUIs for blowing .06 and .04. Even non-drinking Mormon customers were harassed.   And then there's what happened with the 7-11 owner...   One year ago, Cottonwood Heights filed charges against Lani Roberts for selling alcohol to a minor. The standard protocol for this occurrence is that if a convenience store fails a sting and sells alcohol to a minor, the employee who sold the alcohol is terminated and the business owner pays a penalty. But in this instance, the city of Cottonwood Heights decided to charge Roberts personally with criminal negligence, which would have resulted in the termination of her beer license. After nearly a year of delays and “a huge amount of legal fees,” charges were dismissed. The city was unable to prove that Roberts was willingly negligent. Roberts says that anytime an employee has failed a sting they are immediately terminated and, further, if she ever catches an employee selling alcohol to a customer without checking their ID, they are terminated.   And then there's what one of the owners of the Porcupine claims was discussed with him by the developer... From the OP article   According to Bryan O’Meara, co-owner of the Porcupine Pub, he was in talks with the developer where they indicated they could incorporate his restaurant into the future development. The developer and the real estate agent told him that removal of the businesses (such as the Canyon Inn and the 7-11) would not be a problem. Their means of doing this would come from the, “developers relationship with the city.” O’Meara said that once he told his partners of the nefarious means of making the project viable, they ended negotiations with the developers Chris McCandless and Wayne Niederhauser, who work under financier Kevin Gates. McCandless serves on the Sandy City Council, Niederhauser resides as the president of the Utah State Senate.   I mean, if you're looking for hard proof of some conspiracy between the developers and the city, I don't think you're going to find it.  But there's certainly evidence of some shady goings-on."

SaltLakeCity,3df8hd,TheBadWolf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:39:01 2015 UTC,Ironically dogmatic response based on the very first example of how the US constitution was designed to rebuke dogma.
SaltLakeCity,3df8hd,ztj,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:42:19 2015 UTC,"But I mean, the First Amendment is literally the law preventing us from blocking political speech. I'm not being hyperbolic, I'm citing the law that governs the legality of the situation.   Would you accuse me of dogmatism if I said, ""The Americans with Disabilities Act prevents you from refusing service to someone in a wheelchair.""?"
SaltLakeCity,3df8hd,jortr0n,2,Thu Jul 16 19:29:48 2015 UTC,"The dogma is implying that things must be the way they are because things are the way they are. I guess it's also tautological.  The SCOTUS upheld the notion that corporations are also people, which is clearly fucking batshit crazy, but, legally supported and constitutional. It shouldn't be. Nobody should be able to hide behind corporate fronts and PACs and Super PACs to avoid fair spending laws regarding political campaigning.  It actually has very little to do with freedom of speech. Freedom of speech should be protecting individual, independent citizen rights, not corporations, groups, or other mega entities. Doing so undermines our ability to make fair rules about campaigning.  And if that means the 1st amendment has to be re-amended, fine. I doubt that it's necessary. Regular legislation should be sufficient. But, the point is, saying that something is okay because of the 1st amendment is a dogmatic, tautological approach to justifying a status quo that needs to change and runs counter to the very design of the document cited to justify that complacency and acceptance.  TL;DR: Our terrifically unfair campaign status quo needs to change regardless of what laws or constitutional qualities support it, or we don't have a democracy to speak of and said laws and constitution are meaningless in the end. A government for the people, by the people, is the goal. It shouldn't need to be changed to say ""for ALL OF the people, by ALL OF the people"" but, if that's the kind of nonsense that must happen to get where we should be, whatever. Do whatever. Don't accept that the given laws and rules are immutable."
SaltLakeCity,3df8hd,ztj,-1,Thu Jul 16 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"The SCOTUS upheld the notion that corporations are also people, which is clearly fucking batshit crazy, but, legally supported and constitutional.    This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the ruling. The court affirmed that people don't lose their First Amendment rights because they choose to band together and exercise those rights collectively.   It actually has very little to do with freedom of speech. Freedom of speech should be protecting individual, independent citizen rights, not corporations, groups, or other mega entities.    The court system cannot deny free speech rights based on assembly, the constitution is clear on that. Citizens United upheld it. And personally I think it was the right decision.   And if that means the 1st amendment has to be re-amended, fine. I doubt that it's necessary.    It would absolutely be necessary, or else the ruling would have gone the other way. Your proposal to disallow free expression because people want to pool their resources is against the spirit and the word of the First Amendment, there's no way your proposal could be constitutional without further amending the constitution.   TL;DR: Our terrifically unfair campaign status quo needs to change regardless of what laws or constitutional qualities support it, or we don't have a democracy to speak of and said laws and constitution are meaningless in the end.    Now you're the one turning hyperbole up to 11. ""If I don't get my way, this is the end of democracy and the end of our nation!"" Come on.   A government for the people, by the people, is the goal. It shouldn't need to be changed to say ""for ALL OF the people, by ALL OF the people"" but, if that's the kind of nonsense that must happen to get where we should be, whatever.    What does this even mean? The constitution guarantees us freedom of speech, it has never and certainly will never guarantee that our speech will be heard. Ironically the answer to your concern about being drowned out by corporate interests can be solved by the very assembly you're trying to outlaw; you and your friends and other like-minded individuals are free to band together to support a political ideal. You're the one proposing making that illegal."
SaltLakeCity,3df8hd,jortr0n,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:57:46 2015 UTC,"A low ratio of people : dollars is big money. If the people who are involved in choosing to spend or donate towards a candidate are, say, the board of a corp you will see numbers like 1:$350,000 easily. Whereas, if a large group of concerned citizens group up such as with citizen lobbying groups like OpenMedia, you can realistically expect numbers more like 1:$100  That is the meaning of big money vs grass roots.   The reason big money is a problem should be obvious. Stats show painfully clearly that money wins elections and if that money comes from a very small group, democracy is circumvented. Sadly, it is very hard to convince people to understand why campaign finance reform, and legislation to reverse the effect of Citizen United ruling are so critical.   So for the time being, you can be a king maker if you have a large bank account. Who even needs democracy? Well not us I guess, since we haven't had it for some time."

SaltLakeCity,3dev78,deywho,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:10:30 2015 UTC,What's wrong with people pooling their money together?
SaltLakeCity,3dev78,jortr0n,2,Wed Jul 15 20:22:40 2015 UTC,"Let's break this down for you. Current rulings provide a $7500 donation cap to candidates. This rule allows for everyone to be on an even field. $7500 you are not going g to get much out of a candidate other than a than you. It also goes on record to show that X person or X company donated to Y candidate.  Where PAC's come in and Citizens United, this prevents any donation restrictions and allows a company or a group of companies to support a candidate with unlimited funding. This also shields X company's name from being associated with Y candidate because the money came from a PAC and not X company.   In doing this you remove all transparency in election funding, and allow candidates to be bought. A $30,000 donation will get you alot more special meetings than a $7500 donation.   Basically a PAC is a mob for individuals or corporations to elect candidates who will bend over for their money and special interests.   If you are tired of big money running your government and creating special interest groups PACs and Citizens United are something you should not be happy about and actively looking at candidates that do not support them on the federal level."

They offered a dirt cheap pass for SLC residents and no one bought it. They've tried, and no one cared.  I've been a huge proponent of extending operating hours and lowering ticket prices, but it's time to just admit people aren't interested."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,TheBadWolf,18,Tue Jul 14 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"It's because driving is still more convenient in Utah, even in downtown SLC, than public transit. Traffic is rarely very bad, and parking can almost always be found and is relatively inexpensive.   The reason everyone uses public transit in really big, dense cities is because driving and parking your car is generally more expensive and more time consuming than hopping on the metro. As a result, people started taking the trains and buses, which made increasing frequency and routes a profitable option.  So basically, driving needs to become worse in Utah before our transit can really be better."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,The_Crass-Beagle_Act,3,Tue Jul 14 18:08:52 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think that has been the Becker administration's philosophy from the start, make driving and parking possible, but a total pain to do.  The problem is that doing so without the cooperation of the surrounding municipalities means it might drive business away."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,TheBadWolf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:15:41 2015 UTC,"As we can see from the tenor of comments, most people find anything that is going to take them longer than a car intolerable.  They get all hyperbolic, in fact, exaggerating the length of actual commutes.  The real, pressing need along the Wasatch front, however, is not to eliminate bad traffic, but to eliminate the air pollution that is caused by the number of single drivers.  Until people start taking their role in air pollution seriously and be willing to sacrifice time for clean air, we're not going to get people into public transit.  Perhaps if there were incentives on bad air days, then maybe we'd get more people out of their cars and into transit.  There has to be political will to do that, and the current crop of elected government officials outside of SLC itself do not seem interested in clean air in any other way than bringing up the old chestnut that inversions are natural to the Wasatch front, so there is nothing that can be done."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,HatuutaH,5,Tue Jul 14 18:30:32 2015 UTC,"Not getting hyperbolic but here's my situation.  I commute 19 miles each way and it takes ~25 minutes to get from my garage to my office with my car consuming 1.25 gallons of gas for this 38 miles commute and that costs around $3.50 per day in fuel.  I can take Trax which would be a 10 minute walk to the station (or 2 minute bike ride), a 1 hour trip on the train, then a 30 minute walk (or 15 minute bike ride) to my office.  It would cost me $5 to make this trip on a daily basis.  Now, you might suggest I get rid of my car, except I can't, because the rest of this city is not bike or walk friendly enough.  And I can't simply pick up and move closer to work because my husband works 30 minutes in the opposite direction.  Tier 3 gasoline and emissions standards will be enacted in 2017 and we should begin to see a drop in emissions pollution practically overnight.  However, the improvement in air quality will not be as significant as it could potentially be because 4 of our 5 refineries here will not be required to comply with Tier 3 standards.  The other refinery will but it's small-volume and won't have to meet compliance until 2020."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,dmarie229,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"Dude, the refineries do jack shit to contribute to air pollution. You could probably eliminate every single one with minimal effect on air quality."

The refineries are a small fraction of that 11%. Cars are the real culprit. http://www.deq.utah.gov/FactSheets/fspages/sources.htm
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,dk4201,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:27:34 2015 UTC,"I may have worded that confusing, it's not what the refineries emit rather what they produce.  Currently they produce Tier 2 fuel which contains an average of 30ppm of sulphur.  In 2017, Tier 3 regulations will go in to effect which reduces sulphur content to 10ppm.  However, the refineries located in Utah (and which produces 90% of our fuel needs) will NOT be producing Tier 3 fuel because of certain exemptions.    Also going in to effect, is Tier 3 automobiles which will run cleanest on Tier 3 gasoline.  So it's two fold, you have more efficient cars and cleaner gasoline except we won't actually have the cleaner gasoline.  Right now 50% of Wasatch Front emissions are from mobile sources, if Tier 3 gasoline was actually implemented in Utah refineries we could see that number drop to 17%."

They suck. It takes forever to get around. the hours are not convenient. You can barely plan because the schedule online doesn't match the printed schedule doesn't match the actual time the bus shows up. They have no fuicking clue how to make 2 bus/train/trax lines show up at the same p[lace at the same time. they run 30 minutes between busses on Saturday and an hour between them on Sundays. they stop running earlier on Saturday nights.

This represents approximately less than half of one percent of the total daily boardings.   I agree we need better service, of course we need better service. But the market just doesn't demand the kind of changes you want to make."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,TheBadWolf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:44:30 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you this. You go out late, let's say to a bar, you want to ride the bus/trax. Yeah sure you can get home on trax, but if there is no connecting bus....The issue is not juts late night trax, but if the entire system doesn't function in one way or another then one single part would fall away. Now let's look at that 200 boarding number. Let's average 2$ per person. That's 400$ for that last hour. You can;t tell me that the cost of electricity and paying a couple drives wouldn't make this profitable even just running trax. It's them trying to put as much money in the executives pockets as possible. When you are paying out millions of dollars in bonuses a year it has an effect on what you can put back into the system."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,titanicx,0,Wed Jul 15 13:34:31 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I'm not sure what people want them to do.  The first Hive Pass was awesome, $30 a month for unlimited everything.  Yet no one used it."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,VocabAppBuilder,2,Tue Jul 14 19:44:11 2015 UTC,"They never offered it to the majority of riders, outside of SLC....."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,titanicx,7,Tue Jul 14 20:57:32 2015 UTC,"That is because SLC was subsidizing it.  Why should SLC, yet again, subsidize the rest of the county?  Isn't it about time Sandy and other cities in the valley started dropping the dime on stuff like this?  The answer:  yes, it is."

SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,overthemountain,5,Tue Jul 14 16:37:39 2015 UTC,Public transportation is a public service. I would rather pay more in taxes and have it be free.
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,strippingworrior,2,Tue Jul 14 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"Well, a large portion of UTA is paid for by tax money. It's mostly funded by sales tax money. In 2012 passenger fees only accounted for 16% of UTA's budget. I'm not sure if free is the answer. Too often we see people take things for granted when they cost nothing. Perhaps a more nominal fee would help, but I'm not sure cost is the way to go to increase riders."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,overthemountain,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:55:50 2015 UTC,Well those are the reasons I don't use it. Those are the changes I'd need to actually ride UTA.

SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,0492084120,8,Tue Jul 14 16:10:51 2015 UTC,"Same here. It takes 15 minutes to drive to work, the bus would take an hour and a half and doesn't really go where I need it to. Maybe if we had a more dense urban population and a city who didn't insist the streets be a mile wide we would have something a bit more efficient."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,slack90,32,Tue Jul 14 16:29:06 2015 UTC,Why would I take the trax when it costs more money than driving and takes 2x the time? I  am sadly much too selfish of my own time and money to do that.

SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,l-bow-deep,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:17:14 2015 UTC,Taxi lobbied to keep the travel time on trax to the airport longer than the average taxi time. Could absolutely go much faster.
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,CAPHILL,2,Fri Jul 17 04:08:25 2015 UTC,That's if they are on schedule as well.  Most bus routes should hit SL Central with a few minutes to spare before the train leaves...that's not always the case though.  I can't even count how many times I've pulled in on a bus as the train is starting to pull away.  It's a pretty boring hour long wait until the next train.

SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,Brainswarm,6,Wed Jul 15 01:17:52 2015 UTC,"Living up north it's fairly comparable in terms of time needed to go from my house to downtown via both car and public transit.  The problem I have is that it's really hard for me to justify spending $10 on a ticket from the Roy station to SL Central and back when it only costs me $7 or $8 in gas privately.  There's pretty much three ways that boost ridership. Increase breadth of routes, increase the depth of the current routes, and reducing the cost to ride.   Of course, Utah wants the public transit system to turn a profit without subsidies, but let's be realistic. They're not providing a necessary service to a majority of the population."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,epiwssa,6,Tue Jul 14 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"Not really trying to defend UTA - I used DC's Metro system years ago and loved it and was kind of disappointed with how UTA runs, but UTA is subsidized. The majority of their budget is from taxes.  Also, for your cost analysis, there are other things you'd need to factor in. Mileage wear and tear, upkeep, parking, etc. I won't count insurance or car payments since you are presumably still going to own a car regardless, although your premiums could be lower if you weren't driving to work every day. Either way, it sounds like it's pretty close and it is hard to beat the convenience of having your own car when you need it."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,overthemountain,2,Tue Jul 14 17:08:28 2015 UTC,"You're also just getting dropped downtown when you take Frontrunner, and you have to consider time driving to the Frontrunner station and time waiting for the train to leave. If you're trying to go up to the U or even to City Creek or something that adds a whole other set of waiting and riding. I live in Ogden and from the time leaving my house to the time I could get to the U, it would probably take about 2 and a half hours rather than about 1 hour driving."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,XBidoofX,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:29:48 2015 UTC,I'm surprised it is comparable for you.  I was living in Ogden and going to grad school in SLC.  I was excited when the Frontrunner started up because I thought I could take the Frontrunner to SLC and Trax up to the U.  It was going to add more than 45 min to my already hour long commute so I never opted to go that route.

SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,drivec,4,Tue Jul 14 17:50:25 2015 UTC,"Still, that's pretty much a blip compared to the fact that gas prices were crazy low this year. They could perhaps offset this loss in ridership with a jumpstart on their alleged distance-based fare system plans for TRAX and bus (I've heard talk, but that's about it)."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,saulgold,3,Tue Jul 14 13:41:32 2015 UTC,"It's always faster to bike in SLC. I've lived in New York and Boston and Chicago and used public transit happily in each of those cities. It just takes too long here. It'd be awesome if there were express LR routs.   That's why the Hive pass didn't appeal to SLC residents, IMO. Why buy a Hive pass for $30/month when it takes 10 minutes to bike from, say, City Creek Center to the U and 30 minutes or more on Trax? Another example: I can bike from the downtown library to Sugar House Park in the same or less time than it would take if I used UTA. That's quite a trek, by SLC standards, yet Trax + bus are pretty useless to me since they don't save time.   UTA is just too slow to be useful if you don't leave the city."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,paganmonkeyboy,3,Tue Jul 14 20:21:44 2015 UTC,"Anyone from the UTA reading these ? The city is a fucking grid for fuck's sake, how hard is it to make this work ? Me no gets...why don't we have smaller trolleys just running NS EW on all the main lines, every third one is express and hits certain color coded stops but not all so you don't have to wait as long...would that work ?"
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,Spishal_K,2,Wed Jul 15 05:17:08 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that LRT is designed to act as a ""backbone"" for metropolitan transit, and not a one size fits all solution. With the exception of a handful of areas that are still under-served (most of the east bench, NSL, etc) the Trax system has been fleshed out as good as it'll get. The only thing you can do to make it better is to make it 24/7 and cheap, which is what should have been done to begin with.     But even that will only give you a boost up to a certain level. The ideal situation, and what's required to see UTA getting any serious use, is to develop a system wherein no matter where I am, I can get transit to wherever I want to go within 5 minutes walk. Currently that's only possible downtown."
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,titanicx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:00:35 2015 UTC,They need a West Valley/Magna line that runs every 15 minutes as well. the 35/35M bus lines are the highest usage in the system.
SaltLakeCity,3d8xqs,Spishal_K,5,Tue Jul 14 21:00:03 2015 UTC,The WV line could definitely stand to go a lot farther. Honestly there's no reason for it to at least go all the way out to 5600W.

Each offers such vastly unique experiences that you won't find anywhere else in the world. If you choose Zion, know that it is probably a bit more crowded at this time of year than Arches and Canyonlands, but would still be very cool. Angels Landing, while being crowded at this time of year, is one of the coolest places on Earth. I'd recommend a sunset hike up there and maybe hang around the narrows during the day to escape some of the heat."
SaltLakeCity,3dafx4,groovyboobies,2,Tue Jul 14 19:43:23 2015 UTC,"That's a tough one...Arches is probably my favorite of the southern Utah parks, I just love going up the entrance and then everything opens up and you see the courthouse towers, feels like you've entered a completely different cartoon world. The hike up to Delicate Arch is a must-do, and you can pretty easily hit all of the landmarks in a day. Same goes for Canyonlands.  With Zion, there are a lot more hiking opportunities and things to do, but it also draws a bigger crowd. Angels Landing is my favorite hike, and as long as you're not deathly afraid of heights and severe drop-offs, that hike is worth the trip alone.  Don't count out Bryce either, that place is amazing and will be a lot cooler this time of the year than Zion or Arches because of the altitude.  Short answer: draw from a hat."
SaltLakeCity,3dafx4,noodlz05,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:48:32 2015 UTC,My answer would be Yellowstone or Grand Teton in the summer and south Utah in late fall or early spring (when it's not insanely hot and crowded).

One thing I would do is check the status of the main trails at Zion before you go.

SaltLakeCity,3d5gbk,HatuutaH,22,Mon Jul 13 17:53:33 2015 UTC,Golf courses are such a waste of public park money. No other park takes so much land and resources to serve such a small number of community members.
SaltLakeCity,3d5gbk,SenorKerry,8,Mon Jul 13 19:23:13 2015 UTC,"And as a result, people have to pay a premium to use those facilities. The revenue golf courses bring in from player fees almost covers the entire cost of maintaining the facility...unlike other parks that taxpayers have to foot the entire bill for."

SaltLakeCity,3d5gbk,noodlz05,3,Mon Jul 13 20:54:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to find this. While they are almost self-sustaining financially it still seems like a waste of resources in a desert climate. You could start a park that gives people firehoses to shoot into a volcano and people would probably pay good money to do so but just because it's financially a wash doesn't mean it's a great idea.
SaltLakeCity,3d5gbk,SenorKerry,8,Mon Jul 13 22:13:53 2015 UTC,"Not going to argue that...but I do think golf courses have value in the community so I would hate to see them go. I think what they should do is make the courses a bit more desert-friendly by removing the large swaths of grassy areas in favor of desert landscaping, similar to how Vegas and southern Utah courses look. You could probably cut water requirements in half just doing that alone."
SaltLakeCity,3d5gbk,noodlz05,2,Mon Jul 13 23:09:37 2015 UTC,I fully agree. You know in Los Angeles the government offered $2 a square foot to get rid of turf grass. I would totally take advantage of that here. It's a shame that xeriscaping costs a lot of money.

It was designed for children of all abilities and has ramps as well as chair swings for kids. Red Butte Garden is a beautiful paved botanical garden. As far as parks if you head down south to Moab or Bryce Canyon, much of those parks are hard rock, almost like concrete. Also, many of the bigger monuments have decent paved or hard packed trails.

SaltLakeCity,3d5w67,groovyboobies,3,Mon Jul 13 23:05:24 2015 UTC,"I second Silver Lake. The drive through Big Cottonwood Canyon is breathtaking, and most of the loop around Silver Lake is a boardwalk—totally accessible via wheelchair. You may also have fun exploring Temple Square (beautiful flowers, fountains, architecture, etc), which is all paved with wheelchair accessibility in the visitors centers. If you do check out Liberty Park, Tracy Aviary (inside the park) could be fun for kids. Memory Grove Park (at the base of City Creek Canyon) is also a lovely place to stroll; there are always families and dog-walkers there.  If you're going to be south of SLC, the drive through American Fork Canyon and the Alpine Loop is stunning. You can come back up through Provo Canyon and head over to Park City, which is a fun ski resort town reminiscent of a Swiss village. I'm guessing the Alpine Coaster there could be ridden by a non-ambulatory passenger. http://www.parkcitymountain.com/site/summer/activities/alpine-coaster/index.html  Have so much fun!"

SaltLakeCity,3d70zt,weffey,4,Tue Jul 14 00:51:35 2015 UTC,"I used to live at the top of the hill on 800 south when this intersection was open to traffic.  If I recall correctly they closed it to through traffic around 1995.  They placed Jersey barricades there for many years (at least 10) until the islands that are there now were built.  This intersection is much safer being closed and should never be reopened.  Westbound traffic has a total blind spot until cresting over the hill after Elizabeth St. (1150 E).  Even if traveling the speed limit, the stopping distance is very short. If a car on 1100 east were to stall in the intersection it would be a close call in ideal conditions.  Snow and/or icy conditions only make the situation even more unsafe.  Having a 4 way stop on 8th south at that location is totally untenable and way over-prioritizes 11th East traffic.  800 S is a major thoroughfare and that particular location is a terrible spot for a stop sign.  I don't know if there was one particular accident or not (as /u/olds refers to) that brought about the closing. But, I do know that in the early 90s there were at least a two separate pedestrian fatalities on 8th south between 1200 East and 1150 east at the top of the hill from cars traveling eastbound up the hill.  The situation is the same in the other direction, the drivers could not see over the crest of the hill and were unable to stop in time to avoid a collision."

SaltLakeCity,3d70zt,olds,2,Tue Jul 14 23:35:40 2015 UTC,"I remember in the late 90s that was open to through-traffic (with a two-way stop for cars on 11th east), but IIRC there was a pretty horrific accident in '98/99 so they closed it off. A 4 way stop is very difficult there due to the speed of cars going down the hill, especially in winter."
SaltLakeCity,3d70zt,wyldcrater,2,Tue Jul 14 01:40:54 2015 UTC,"That island is a safety barrier for cars crossing north or south on 1100 east. The speed of cars coming west bound on 800 south is just too much for adequate safety of those traveling on 1100 east. As a cyclist, even I get scared trying to cross that intersection. You also have a high school a block east, and high school students are not the best drivers on the road."

The upload rate is capped at 5mbps which really only matters when I am uploading HD video to YouTube. I stream multiple tvs at the same time and play XBOX live and it's good. This is my second year with the service.
SaltLakeCity,3d5xq4,SenorKerry,2,Mon Jul 13 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"Also, does anyone know exactly when GoogleFiber will be available? (Trying to decide how long of a contract to lock into).   No one knows any sort of exact date, or even estimated date.  I would be [pleasantly] surprised if it was available before next year to any significant number of homes, or even at all. They have started construction in various areas laying lines along streets though. IIRC they stated their plan is to build a ring around the service area, then build the infrastructure inwards.  Aside from that ring statement, there really hasn't been much news since the initial announcement.  All of that said, I wouldn't be surprised if it were available within the year for a good number of homes. If you're very confident that your house is in an area that will be eligible, it may not be worth it to you to agree to a 12 month contract, or at least be willing to cancel early/pay for double services."
SaltLakeCity,3d5xq4,YupYesYeah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:39:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not in SLC proper, out in WVC.   In my experience CenturyLink is terrible.   Inconsistent speed and really bad latency(which doesn't matter as much unless you're gaming online).    More importantly, bandwidth is really strained during peak hours.   When I had CL, I had a lot of trouble getting a decent bitrate just to watch Netflix.   Comcast is a better service, but the cost is a lot higher, but it's not really a choice for me if I want to game online at all."
SaltLakeCity,3d5xq4,ZombieTurtleHS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:14:42 2015 UTC,"Do you live in a house in Sugarhouse?  Also what speeds are you looking for?  I had comcast for 8 years, and never had a problem outside of being pricey.  I recently was able to get 1 gig up/down fiber connection from centurylink in April.  It has been amazing."
SaltLakeCity,3d5xq4,hadoukenMD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:57:21 2015 UTC,"I'm in millcreek with century link and my connection is fast, I game online and download all the time and never have problems. My plan is $19.99 a month. Idk if it means anything but the line goes through my backyard and some guys were there the other day stringing fiber optics for century link, so it may even get better."
SaltLakeCity,3d5xq4,destructum1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:58:00 2015 UTC,"Centurylink has the worst customer service. Terrible experiences with them. All with fulfillment on their side. I have put up with them only because of how cheap it is, but at the end of my promotional rate I will be dumping them to go back to comcast. The cheap price isn't worth the effort. And my connection drops all the time."

SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,meggyver,6,Mon Jul 13 01:25:46 2015 UTC,"I also had an experience with not moving forward for not being LDS.   That is not legal. They legally CANNOT ask you anything about your religion is in a job interview. If you are ever subjected to discrimination based on your religious views make sure to document the incident (write down when, where, who, and how) and report it to the Utah Labor Commission"
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,varthalon,5,Mon Jul 13 04:22:48 2015 UTC,"They can't ask you, but as a former Mormon, I can tell you that it is extremely easy to tell who is and isn't Mormon without asking. At that point, it's going to be pretty hard to prove they didn't hire someone because they weren't LDS."
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,brockobear,3,Mon Jul 13 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"Especially with employment at will laws, they don't even have to give a reason for firing/not promoting an employee."
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,Grumbleduke7749,2,Mon Jul 13 06:13:40 2015 UTC,"I had the same experience in a few of my interviews. At the same time I have been hired by 2 very large Mormon-owned companies so I find that it really comes down to the person hiring. In the same way some people only hire men or some people hire pretty ladies this is something that happens here, but at the end of the day you wouldn't be happy at a place like that anyway so be happy you didn't get the job."
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,SenorKerry,2,Mon Jul 13 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"True, but they have sneaky ways to find out if you are Mo or not without asking outright. The discrimination in Utah is real, and unless the employer is dumb enough to ask outright there's not much we can do about it."

SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,TLOKorra,4,Mon Jul 13 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"Oh! Another thing I neglected to look into before moving here: Utah is one of the worst states for the gender wage gap.  So, if you're a woman look forward to companies paying you even less than the already low wages they're offering.    Edit: Why was this downvoted?  Utah is one of the worst states for the gender wage gap. It's a fact.  If you have a point to make regarding this, please I would love to read it.  But just downvoting facts you don't like doesn't enrich a discussion."
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,brockobear,7,Mon Jul 13 02:30:13 2015 UTC,"Probably downvoted because it depends entirely on where you are in the state. There was an in-state one done a couple of years ago and Provo was way worse than SLC proper which was close to on par with the rest of the country.  The other issue, IIRC, is that while it doesn't include the voluntarily unemployed, it does include the high percentage of women who work low-wage part time jobs while their children are in school and women who return to the workforce after taking a decade or so off to raise kids (Utah has an extremely high number of both of these).  So, I guess the take away is, yes, the wage gap is real, but no, it's not as extreme in SLC as the state rate might lead you to believe."
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,ajfa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:10:02 2015 UTC,"Not sure why the downvote... it is indeed a problem in Utah.   One thing I've noticed is that there has been (at least in Utah in the past) a more rigid idea of a ""woman's job"" vs a ""man's job"", which makes it harder for women to even get a job in some fields (law, finance). This is getting better but it is still a problem -- Utah has a ""boy's club"" feel.    I don't think this makes you more likely to be underpaid as an admin specifically because you are female, but in the aggregate all admins might be underpaid, and a many of them are female.   On the other hand, if you're a woman pursuing a career academia in computing or engineering, you will have your career handed to you on a silver platter."
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,rachie27,3,Mon Jul 13 03:44:11 2015 UTC,Programmer here. I've had to fight tooth and nail for my job and have always gotten paid significantly less than my male peers. Don't know where your silver platter perception is coming from but it's far from reality.
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,ajfa,0,Mon Jul 13 06:52:34 2015 UTC,"Note I didn't say ""pursuing a career in software development"". I said ""pursuing a career in academia in computing or engineering"".   BIG difference."
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,jortr0n,0,Mon Jul 13 13:37:01 2015 UTC,"It's lower because many women stay at home to raise children, among other factors that aren't related to gender. Paying them lower because they're women is, ya know, illegal."
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,jortr0n,3,Mon Jul 13 03:43:46 2015 UTC,Women who are at home raising children aren't put into the formula.  We're talking about people in the work force.  I'm not going to sit here and argue if the wage gap is a real thing.
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,rachie27,0,Mon Jul 13 03:51:00 2015 UTC,"If it happens, why aren't there class action lawsuits happening all over the state?"
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,xlrambling,2,Mon Jul 13 03:53:21 2015 UTC,Because it's insanely difficult to prove. Most people don't want to sue anyone. They just want to make a fair wage for the work they do.
SaltLakeCity,3d2ppk,TLOKorra,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:54:52 2015 UTC,"It happens everywhere.  Utah is just one of the worst places by the numbers.  Look it up.    Trying to prove systematic discrimination is nearly impossible.  Why aren't there class action lawsuits regarding heavier prison sentences for African Americans?  Because it's hard to prove on a one on one basis, but really easy to see in overall data - it's the same with the gender wage gap and a lot of other systematic discrimination.  I'm done with this discussion.  I love Reddit, but this is an area where Reddit's demographic bias really starts showing."

SaltLakeCity,3d0nkh,thecadenman,2,Sun Jul 12 14:57:40 2015 UTC,Search the sub with keywords about moving. You'll get tons of info. This is asked almost daily.
SaltLakeCity,3d0nkh,jortr0n,2,Sun Jul 12 16:32:28 2015 UTC,"I've seen many people move here without jobs lined up, and it almost always ends badly. Few save up enough money to last more than a few months, and usually it takes them a while to get a job and then a couple more weeks to get their first pay check.           Further, the LDS faith is prevalent here, which means Utah is always packed full of young people (because Mormons highly encourage families having many, many children), which means it is hard to find jobs that can be done without college degrees. This is not a criticism of Mormons; it's just a fact of employment in the area that you should be aware of if you are going to move here. So, I recommend you contact vet offices, humane societies, animal shelters, etc. to see if (or how often) they have openings. Alternatively, you could get some other job setup, and then find your dream job in animal care once you're here. These places are more likely to hire you if you're already here, and especially if you've been volunteering in their offices for a few weeks or months, which many people already do.        Oh, and if your main goal is to live near the outdoors, I'd recommend checking for jobs in other northwestern cities. Many cities in this part of the country have nearby mountains, lakes, rivers, etc. Living in SLC has it's perks, but everywhere I've ever lived has been worth staying in (and I've lived in quite a few western U.S. cities)."
SaltLakeCity,3d0nkh,gizamo,2,Sun Jul 12 16:59:29 2015 UTC,"Kiss the city good bye.  I moved from Mexico City to SLC, it is a huge change.

SaltLakeCity,3d0nkh,RedBull7,2,Sun Jul 12 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"I moved here about a year ago. The accessibility to the outdoors is amazing, but you have to get a car. Here's an example of a standard apartment in the downtown area. Feel free to PM me with any other questions you have. :)"
SaltLakeCity,3d0nkh,CherryCereja,2,Sun Jul 12 21:01:41 2015 UTC,One of he things that's great about SLC is how close the outdoors are! I do think you'll be wanting a car though. We have public transportation and though it's good it also doesn't go everywhere. And you can drive to the parks and hikes.   Another good resource is ksl.com. It seems the locals use this more than craigslist for jobs and other classifieds. SLC is a small city but I love it. Good luck!

SaltLakeCity,3czg8y,movin_throwaway,7,Sun Jul 12 04:34:34 2015 UTC,"The most frequent complaint I hear from non-mormons living in highly mormon communities is that they often feel excluded from community events.  I don't think this is intentional on the part of the mormons. Rather  it is an unintentional consequence of how they do things. Since they all get together anyway on Sundays, that church becomes a natural time for them to plan events for later in the week, even community events that really have nothing to do with their church. Unfortunately since you aren't going to their church then you might miss-out on hearing about the event or be overlooked when it is all put together.  What I would recommend to counter this is to make friends with a couple of your neighbors who happen to be mormons and ask them to specifically keep you in the loop and included in community events."
SaltLakeCity,3czg8y,varthalon,6,Sun Jul 12 05:00:17 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that the people that tend to complain about 'being excluded' are the same type of people that complain about their 'neighbors always inviting them to stuff, its so annoying, stop trying to convert me'.

SaltLakeCity,3czg8y,recoilboobs,4,Sun Jul 12 05:47:55 2015 UTC,"I would say to look into the more rural areas of Herriman and Bluffdale. It is still has a very spread out feel and doesn't feel as suburban for the most part. Lehi is growing exponentially with all the tech, and I doubt it will be what you are looking for in the next 3-4 years. And the commute from Saratoga Springs and further south isn't going to be a very fun one most days."
SaltLakeCity,3czg8y,Deforesting,3,Sun Jul 12 13:10:50 2015 UTC,"I recommend Herriman. There are some places in Herriman that are quite rural feeling still, especially as you get closer to the Oquirrh (spelling?) mountains. Try looking in High country Estates and neighborhoods close by there. I know some new developments recently opened up in that area."
SaltLakeCity,3czg8y,TheGarp,3,Sun Jul 12 10:28:22 2015 UTC,"Herriman can get pretty rural feeling, for sure. I'd look there before committing to anywhere in Utah County. Or look around Davis County. Hell, I'd look in Tooele and Stansbury before committing to anywhere in Utah County. Consider basically any other option first.  The reason being, if you aren't Mormon some part of living anywhere in Utah County is going to suck. This gets worse nearer to Provo, so Lehi or what have you is going to have the least of that, but it will always be there, moreso than in any other location on the Wasatch Front. Speaking from my own experience (as a teenager, not a small child, but still), and the experience of many of my friends who grew up here, being a non-LDS kid in a heavily LDS community is a very painful way to grow up. I cannot recommend enough doing what you can to shield your kids from that, even if it means you get an overall less down home experience."

Herriman, too, can give a very small town feel.  Bluffdale too.  Some friends of ours bought an acre of land in bluffdale and built on it for just about $350000.  Saratoga springs and eagle mountain.... I fall on the Mormon hellhole side of things and I'm active lds! Plus, the newer developments build the houses literally 8 feet from one another on all sides!  You have walkable parks, but you can hear your neighbors fart."
SaltLakeCity,3czg8y,TheGarp,2,Sun Jul 12 05:54:11 2015 UTC,Draper is actually pretty quiet--our farm share was grown down there. I would suggest that you give Draper or Riverton a chance.
SaltLakeCity,3czg8y,ekul_reklawyks,2,Sun Jul 12 06:10:39 2015 UTC,Unfortunately Draper's housing costs are shooting way up with all this prison-leaving going on. ( assuming one is looking to buy a house)

There are three parks with playgrounds within walking distance of our apartment, plus a trail to walk the dog on. Something like 80% of the population here is Mormon so we were really nervous, but so far it has exceeded our expectations. There are lots of bigger community events that we are excited to attend and we have yet to feel like outsiders."
SaltLakeCity,3czg8y,darthweder,4,Sun Jul 12 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"I think Eagle Mountain or Saratoga Springs is going to be your best bet to have a more rural vibe. The only thing I would say is you may have to be more flexible on your travel time, ultimately if it is convenient then it is probably suburban. Also if you look in Utah County you will probably find more options but you will be stuck using I-15 and the traffic will be brutal.  The biggest problem is traffic, Utah only has I-15 going north and south freeway wise, Redwood road is not a highway but it is an artery road so it will have traffic during peak times (Saratoga Springs you'd be using Redwood as I-15 isn't a viable option)."
SaltLakeCity,3czg8y,TheGarp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:38:18 2015 UTC,I was planning to take Redwood Road up as I work just west of I-15 in Draper.  Is this not a wise idea?  Could I make it from Saratoga Springs to about 11400 South Lone Peak in less than 25 minutes at 7:30?
SaltLakeCity,3czg8y,TheGarp,2,Sun Jul 12 05:45:09 2015 UTC,"Best case scenario, you're looking at about 30 minutes drive from the center of Saratoga Springs.  You'd probably be better off not taking I-15 and taking SR-68 (redwood rd) instead."

SaltLakeCity,3czg8y,BigFatBeardo,4,Sun Jul 12 14:13:23 2015 UTC,"I live in lehi.  I would say give Lehi serious consideration especially if you have family. I will say there is zero nightlife here (Unless you like national franchise restaurants and their generic bars and sports on TV) but slc is just up the freeway. Lehi is a good place to buy a house as you can still get a nice place in a good neighborhood on a big lot for 250K. Most of the utilities are on poles so if google fiber even thinks about coming here, it would be a piece of cake for them. I walked over to the development going in near me and saw they are dropping fiber with everything else so they are probably doing that by default for any development just to have it there for the future.  The city coffers are well filled due to all the recent tech and retail establishments going in. Lots of lehi proper is established neighborhoods with many large lots cut out 30-40 years ago. As the original owners are now approaching retirement, they are being sold off for development which I feel keeps everything fresh and home values stay rising. The north end has the newer fancier developments but they are above 250K for sure. The roads and schools are all kept up, the parks trimmed and clean and emergency services well funded. The megaplex and a bunch of new restaurants are popping up near the intersection with the road to IM flash. Dinner and a movie would be piece of cake as far as a fast night out, but nothing really cool in the area like good bars, clubs, etc. There's also no places trying to cater to the broke-ass-college-kid crowd either. Lots of kid-friendly events at Thanksgiving point all summer and fall. (tons of summer camps from 1-5 days, sport camps, night-at-the-musem, halloween and fall festivals, corn maze, etc..) Plus, Thanksgiving point has a world class dinosaur museum. You can get an annual membership there and the kids will have stuff to do all year. http://www.thanksgivingpoint.org/-for-youth--thanksgivingpoint.org  The city center (AKA legacy center) has a kick-ass indoor pool, indoor track and lots of sports you can sign yourself or the kids up for. http://www.lehi-ut.gov/discover/legacy-center/  If you are looking for a place with lots of stuff for kids to do, (GTF out of the house and DO something ) I would recommend Lehi for sure. Between the legacy center and Thanksgiving point, and lots of parks around, mine are never bored.  As far as a house built ""in this decade...."" there are plenty of these around but to be honest, I have seen many built with the ply stapled to studs, the rock facades falling off, the cheapest pex plumbing and other mass-produced-as-fast-as-possible shortcuts. Plus, new developments have HOAs which on principle I feel are the spawn of the devil. You just have to do your homework, get inspections, etc.. There's new shitty houses, new awesome houses, houses from the 70s that are solid as a rock, plain-jane ranches ready for a DIY makeover, groovy old-timey brick houses with awesome character and style, and everything in between, depending what part of town you go to.  I use Comcast's telecommuter-level ISP and it's fine. I use a lot of internet intensive apps for work and can work from home without issue.  What about the LDS influence? Utah county is pretty heavy with LDS of course, but you can take it or leave it and no one will give a crap. You wont have missionaries pounding on your door or anything like that. You will find some places closed on Sunday but the places that are open are near empty so shopping is a breeze.  Overall I'd say Lehi is a decent middle of the road place full of people commuting north and south for work, families, and an overall bargain for the mortgage dollar. There's an influx of people moving here for work for sure. Adobe, Oracle, Pure Storage all have new buildings here. Utah county is also sort of a techie-startup area ( I worked for a few). Twitter's boxes are just up the road in Draper along with eBay's new (and old) building , EMC, IM flash, etc.. The whole north Utah county/South SLC county is turning into a very tech-heavy area. I would say if you bought a house here this year, you would get a very strong return on value in the next few years. When the prison moves out of Draper, doubly so.  House Market wise: I got a 1970-built 3200 SF house on a .25 lot for 189k 3 years ago. Same comparable houses that have sold in the area are now 225-240. There's lots of houses with the big 1/2 and full acre ( and larger) lots around so you would of course pay more for that. Across the street from my house, a 4 bedroom 2500SF ranch with 2 car garage on a .75 lot sold for under 200K just last year. I almost bought it to turn into a rental.  I have a friend at work that just bought a new 4 bedroom house on the west side of lehi on a .24 lot for 239k.  I have family and friends in SS and Eagle Mountain... the only thing they hate are the small house lots and nazi-ish HOA people. There's bored housewives and grumpy old farts on their HOAs that literally drive around looking for shit to complain about, report, and fine you over. Personally, I don't like new developed areas. All the houses look the same. It's a place to sleep and that's it. I like variety in the area I live.   Plus, if you move to Lehi, you can help me wrench on my old cars. I have a garage fridge full of beer and Redd's."

Both can be accurate.  It would be a bit ignorant and judgemental of me to say that a particular area of town is one and not the other.  Totally depends on your neighbors.   Regarding geography - Herriman and Riverton still feel quite rural.  If you go south of Bluffdale on I15 - the construction near point of the mountain sucks and traffic can add to the commute.  They are expanding the road, but that's been the case for the last decade and I always dread going south of Draper/Bluffdale.  You may benefit from researching the schools.  There are a lot of interesting politics around the school districts in the different areas discussed."

Lots of big lots, open space. Not so suburbia. Lehi is spread out enough you can find a mix of both. I have family up by Thanksgiving Point, that neighborhood is definitely HOA stepford feeling to me. I have more family down almost by AF in that new highway area, south of the factory. That area is much less suburban from what I've seen. It's a bit younger neighborhood, and a little less ""Mormon or giiiitout"" than the rest of Lehi."
SaltLakeCity,3czpra,travelingmama,4,Sun Jul 12 06:31:33 2015 UTC,"I used the farepay card about 18 months ago for winter, I hope not much has changed since then. Please forgive formatting and spelling as I'm on mobile in bed.  1 I'm pretty sure buses and trax are the same fee. I'd wager they are both at the $2 figure  2 They might be able to scan it and frankly it'd be weird if they couldn't. So long as you paid with it there isn't anything to worry about  3 You would tap 4 times. The system sees that you tapped off recently so it knows not to charge you when you tap on the second time. They use the on and off taps to find out what stops you used on your trip for planning routes and train sizes and whatnot.  4 You can take a bike on a bus but you have to put it up front. It's scary if you haven't done it before, but when you approach it you'll see how easy it is. There is a handle you lift up on the topside of the rack that will release the rack to the lowered posistion. You then plop your bike in the rank and lift the hook/arm thing over the front wheel to hold the bike in place. I would assume it's good practice to use the bike rake closest to the windshield as a second bicyclist wouldn't have to lift their bike over yours to put theirs in second. I PROMISE you that you'll figure it out when you look at it. Be sure to remind the driver you have a bike when you get off so they know you'll be stepping in front of the bus after getting off. Sometimes they give you a little bike voucher as a reminder to you and them. You give the voucher back as you disembark.  5 I think farepay is the best way to go. Back when I used it it was discounted to paying in cash. The system seems to work well. I'd advise you pay in advance on it for all the commutes you plan on taking each payday so you don't run out funds.  Good luck out there!"
SaltLakeCity,3czpra,ben_shepard,3,Sun Jul 12 07:07:03 2015 UTC,"To add/confirm a few things.  First off, UTA has an informative website. Here's the FAREPAY page: http://www.rideuta.com/mc/?page=UTA-Home-FarePayPromo  Next up...  Regarding 1) Fare is the same for TRAX, Street car, and buses but the FAREPAY discount still in effect now and through the end of the year, discounts differently between TRAX/Street car vs bus. $1.50 for local bus rides, $2.00 for TRAX and some other fares have discounts.  Regarding 2) Police have scanning devices for the touchless payments of any kind, including the FAREPAY card as well as things like touchless credit cards, or Apple Pay devices.  Regarding 3) This is right, but, it's worth noting that while in general you always tap as you get on a vehicle and tap as you get off, you don't tap off just to switch trains. If you switch train lines, think of it like you're not actually getting off the train until you're done entirely. So, tap when getting on and off buses, tap when entering and exiting TRAX platforms.  Re 4) Some buses now stow bikes inside in the middle. Driver will surely give you points if you are confused."
SaltLakeCity,3czpra,ztj,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:25:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I did read that page earlier and I'm still confused, if the bus is $1.50 and trax is $2 does it add the $.50 when you transfer? I guess I'll find out..."
SaltLakeCity,3czpra,ggleblanc,2,Sun Jul 12 11:52:24 2015 UTC,You would pay the extra 50 cents.  You could get a paper transfer from the bus and use that to ride the Trax.  You can tap on and off as many times as you need to within a 2 hour period for the $2.00 (or $1.50 for just bus transfers).
SaltLakeCity,3czpra,ggleblanc,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:11:28 2015 UTC,Oh that's good to know!! They'll give you a paper transfer even if you paid with the card?

SaltLakeCity,3czpra,senfmeister,2,Sun Jul 12 11:49:21 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify:  scan every time you get on and off the bus or TRAX.  If you don't, you will be charged maximum fare for your indiscretion.  This is only for bus to TRAX.  When you are on the TRAX platform waiting for another train, you won't need to tap-off/on.  Anyone know of the S line?  It is a separate platform, after all.  The system tracks you and won't charge you for a new fare if you are within the transfer period (2 hours.)  You are charged, however, the extra 50 cents if you move from the bus to TRAX.  Farepay card is the best way to go right now:  the reduced fare can beat the Hive pass if you don't ride every day.  Hive pass is a good way to go if you live in SLC proper.   The bike rack fits two bikes.  If it is full, the driver will usually let you carry it on through the back door BUT it is totally his or her discretion.  Don't get pissed at the driver because he won't let you on the bus with a bike."
SaltLakeCity,3czpra,paradoxymormon,2,Sun Jul 12 14:58:23 2015 UTC,I should be ok because the bus route through my neighborhood is one of the first stops when I'm going to work so there's less chance of the bike rack being full (plus I could tell my husband I had to leave the bike so he could go get it if it really came down to it). Then the Fashion Place trax station is the where the bus starts on my way home from work so if there's no room I can just take the redline train and bike the 4 miles home from the stop.   I can't get the hive pass anyway because I live in West Jordan.
SaltLakeCity,3czpra,fishin4guitars,2,Sun Jul 12 19:53:06 2015 UTC,"for 4 - the rack is on the front of the bus and very simple to use, in the middle of it there is a yellow handle pull up on it and it will drop the platform thing, then there are spots for two bikes, simple lift your bike onto the platform and the there is another yellow thing that you lift out and up that goes over your front tire that holds it in place.  There are spots for 2 bikes and if it is full the bus driver can say he can't take you since bikes are not allowed in the bus, I have seen some drivers make exceptions but 95% will say no. Then you have to wait for the next bus.   If you start taking it every day you should see some bikes get on the bus fairly quickly and if you just watch them it is very simple - or when the bus pulls up just tell the driver you've never putten a biek on and if you could get a hand for your first time - all the drivers are super nice and I usually spend my trips on the bus standing up front conversing back and forth with most of them."

SaltLakeCity,3czf0c,Deathtomyliver,2,Mon Jul 13 13:17:25 2015 UTC,Contact your city. Probably the city clerk's office.   Domestic Partnership is not in the state law (although the Utah courts have ruled that there is nothing in the state law prohibiting them either). Since the state doesn't provide for or disallow them it is up to the local governments to pass an ordinance to allow them.   Edit: Hmm... I'll leave my answer but I'm not sure about it. It seems that what SLC did was pass an ordinance to create a registry to record domestic partnerships but that they can exist without a registry anyway. You may also want to talk to a lawyer specializing in forming domestic partnership agreements.
SaltLakeCity,3czf0c,xjader,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:14:26 2015 UTC,Crazy idea: Just say he is your husband. When I added my husband to my insurance they didn't ask me for proof... I never changed my last name so I don't think it makes a difference.

SaltLakeCity,3cusve,baileyaye,3,Sat Jul 11 20:45:07 2015 UTC,"Sure, some people do... but SLC is a city where it's completely possible to live the suburban dream and have a <15 minute commute.   For example: I live in north Sandy. I paid half per sq ft of what a downtown condo or single-family home in a ""trendy"" neighborhood would cost. I have views, a garage, hot tub, and a yard (hence, a garden where I grown my own vegetables). My commute is 15 minutes downtown, 20 to the U, or 20 to Draper/Lehi. 3 days a week when the weather is nice, I commute 13 miles by bicycle, which only takes about 40 minutes and is fantastic exercise.   I've lived in some very ""walkable"" places, such as a small city in Germany, Andersonville in Chicago. I've also lived in very trendy places which are actually far worse suburban commuting hells than Utah (hello Austin, TX!). However, if I mention to anyone that I live in Sandy, all of a sudden I'm a confederate-flag waving polygamist who is single-handedly causing global warming.   TL;DR -- SLC is great for suburban lifestyles. Don't let the hive mind bully you into buying a massively overpriced condo or starter-bungalow in Sugarhouse."

If you're willing to put a bit into your house there, you can get a single-family home without having to pay exorbitant sugarhouse prices.  What gets me is when people say things like ""never live south of I-80, it's mormon country there"" when they work in Lehi and spend most of their weekend time in the cottonwood canyons anyway. Then they recommend a move to sugarhouse, which is just as LDS and twice the price as areas just a few miles to the south or west."
SaltLakeCity,3cusve,ajfa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:46:43 2015 UTC,I don't get that. Cottonwood is a really nice area. My buddy owns a $600k home out there (more than I will pay). But I don't get sugar house. It's not that nice to me. I prefer where I am.

SaltLakeCity,3cx8jm,Docski,6,Sat Jul 11 16:10:54 2015 UTC,"Red Iguana is a local favorite that has received national attention. If there is a long wait, you can check out Red Iguana 2 (same ownership & menu) nearby. Tell them you're new and ask for the mole sampler before you order so you can sample all the deliciousness. For the most robust selection of local craft brews and some good Cajun food, hit up Bayou (they also have jazz/blues musicians playing there fairly often). My favorite brunch is at Pig & a Jelly Jar, near Liberty Park. If you like American fare, you can't go wrong with Copper Onion and it's right downtown near a couple other great businesses: Broadway Centre Theatre (indie film), Diabolical Records, Ken Sanders Rare books, and a few of the popular bars, including dueling piano joints.  Visitors to SLC usually spend at least a little time at Temple Square. Beautiful flowers and fountains, historical architecture, and you can take free tours if interested.  For some really stunning views nearby, check out Big Cottonwood Canyon and/or Little Cottonwood Canyon and some of the hikes there. I use alltrails.com to check out hikes and see the mileage, difficulty, what to expect, etc. Even just the drive up those canyons is stunning.  If you're here on a Saturday, for sure check out the farmer's market at Pioneer Park. Across the street is Tony Caputo's Market, where you can get incredible cheese, salami, chocolate, oils, etc. They are pretty generous about letting you sample if you show interest.  Have fun!"

SaltLakeCity,3csyv5,HatuutaH,3,Fri Jul 10 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"What, exactly, did the police say to you?"
SaltLakeCity,3csyv5,canoodlekerfuffle,5,Fri Jul 10 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"""Police made it clear they didn't care"" YEP. Had my house in Sugarhouse burglarized in the middle of the day two years ago and the officer that came and made the report did absolutely nothing except interview me about what was missing. I asked him if he would take fingerprints and he said no. He then proceeded to recommend that I interview my neighbors to ask them if they saw anything. As in I should investigate the crime myself. even gave me ideas for which houses to go to and what kinds of questions I should ask my neighbors. He also said I should stop in at the local pawn shops and see if any of my belongings happen to show up. I asked him, isn't that like your job or something ? He had no answer for me.  my rental insurance company asked me to call and follow up on the police report the next week, when I called and inquired on the status of the investigation I basically got a laugh. Sorry that this happened to you, getting robbed is the worst, I totally understand the feelings of violation that pile on top of the fact that all your stuff is gone :("
SaltLakeCity,3csyv5,CultZero,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:09:27 2015 UTC,"He said it looked like they had gloves so no fingerprints. He said that even though the guy drank a beer and left it, the police don't do DNA tests unless it's a felony. When we told him about the possible suspect, he said that without a license plate, there's nothing they could do."
SaltLakeCity,3csyv5,HatuutaH,6,Fri Jul 10 16:00:11 2015 UTC,the police don't do DNA tests unless it's a felony   I'm not understanding this statement since a burglary is clearly a felony.
SaltLakeCity,3csyv5,CrimsonSmear,2,Fri Jul 10 17:10:42 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I didn't understand it either. I'm just quoting what the officer said. It was really frustrating when he said that because he acknowledged that there would be DNA evidence and said he wouldn't test it."
SaltLakeCity,3csyv5,HatuutaH,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:38:17 2015 UTC,And what would be the point of it? Unless the burglar already has DNA in the system--which is highly unlikely--DNA evidence is totally useless.  The only thing it would do is help to convict the person if they find him.  I think just catching the burglar red-handed with your stuff will be enough to ensure a conviction.
SaltLakeCity,3csyv5,canoodlekerfuffle,3,Fri Jul 10 18:56:22 2015 UTC,"If you get it in the system and they get caught for another crime, you can convict them on both if it doesn't go past the statute of limitations. Seems like it would be useful data."

SaltLakeCity,3cnglp,jules0072,2,Thu Jul 9 07:17:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting. I'm way pregnant and our bedroom is in the basement. I'm just west of liberty. I saw the flashing from the electrical storm but between the fetus and a scared dog I could go upstairs and see the excitement. I miss Minnesota!  And then the rain! I didn't even know the rain happened. Looks fun!
SaltLakeCity,3cnglp,CatsMakeGoodSnacks,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:05:34 2015 UTC,So you purposely went out to drive thru flood water?
SaltLakeCity,3cnglp,Motheroftheworld,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:06:43 2015 UTC,"Yes. Glad you liked the video!   The water we drove through wasn't very deep - less than 8"". Our vehicle has good ground clearance. You could still see the paint on the roads. It was more like driving through a big puddle. I'm well aware of the dangers of driving through moving water (I lived in Arizona where flash flooding is serious business), and I wouldn't go anywhere near fast moving water, water covered bridges, water strong enough to move debris, or water that you can't see how deep it is.   This is a van similar to ours: http://youtu.be/D8VtCHuTY40"

That being said, the cost of living here is very reasonable.  You could probably get an apt with roommates in the $500 range, $750 minimum (probably more) for living solo.  Would be rough living alone on that kinda salary.  Check out http://www.wildrosesports.com/  it's in a cool section of town, the avenues, but it's expensive there, even for SLC.

While there are workarounds for daily specials (only offer that alcohol on that one day) there are no workarounds for a mug club.    The cost of the liquor violation they could receive if they actually offer these discounts will probably cost as much as they rake in on kickstarter.

I could be wrong; I'll update with the facts shortly.   Edit: I was wrong. It's $50 for the year. The first Monday of each month you can get two free beers and a free appetizer.

SaltLakeCity,3cigc3,Master112,7,Wed Jul 8 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"Blue Finn, Yi Sushi, Ichiban, and Red Ginger were part of a wave of sushi restaurants that opened up a few years back that were the bigger on bargain than quality. Out of the four, Blue Finn and Yi Sushi are by far the best, and I'll go to either one of them. Blue Finn is Korean owned and sports some korean dishes as well. Yi is chinese owned and has a side menu of your typical chinese food. Both are good are easy on the wallet.  I haven't been to Itto, so I can't rate it.  Sapa and Fat Fish are actually owned by the same family and I believe their menu is exactly the same with the exception of Fat Fish being slightly cheaper. Sapa has a more extensive overall menu, but for straight sushi, I think it's identical. The food is more expensive than Blue Finn and Yi Sushi, but the fish is fresher and they use a larger variety of ingredients.  Sushi Groove is hipper and is more of a trendy/fusion menu. Nothing wrong with that at all, just know that's what you're getting. They aren't even that expensive. Around the same price as Sapa.  Tsunami is great quality fish at a good price. They aren't cheap, but I still think they're a good value. Easily one of my favorite places in the valley, but as for being ""delicious without hurting the wallet too much"", I'd say its more ""Delicious with still kinda hurting the wallet, even though its still worth every penny""  Takashi is in my humble opinion, the best sushi restaurant in the valley. Amazingly fresh and diverse seafood, skilled chefs, awesome ingredients. Problem is, it breaks the bank. It's great, but the wallet feels it. Still, you have to try it. It's pretty great.  As for my personal favorite, I would have to say it's Sakana Sushi in Jordan Landing (Not Commons). It's much like Tsunami, great fish, diverse menu, skilled chefs, but not quite so hard on the wallet as Takashi's. The only reason I take these guys over Tsunami is it's slightly cheaper, and because there is only one location compared to 3 tsunami, I've had some less skilled chefs on occasion at Tsunami. For the most part, though, Tsunamis chefs are still stellar, but I've had a couple misses over the years and have yet to receive a miss from Sakana."

The miso soup is great!  I'm sure the more picky sushi eaters aren't going to like this place as much, but it's just great for me and my friends.  The only other place I've been to frequently enough to review is Tsunami in Sugar House, which wasn't bad, but it wasn't noticeably any better than Sushi Groove (to me) and I've always paid more for less food there.  The lunch prices seem a bit more reasonable, so if you're gonna go to Tsunami I suggest going during lunch hours.  Oh and the miso soup doesn't even compare.  Note:  I've had inconsistent food at both locations, so a lot of times it probably has more to do with who is preparing your sushi than where they are preparing it.  Sometimes the rolls at Sushi Groove are cut a bit larger than they should be IMO and sometimes they can be a bit messy.  And at Tsunami, I've ordered a roll and had it come out nice and pretty and garnished nicely and then got another identical roll and had it come out plain and boring.  The best bet is probably just to get to know the chefs and figure out who has got their shit together."

Personally though, I haven't really heard Biskupski talk much about issues that I care about, and the things she has said about them (like her statement about the S-Line) are not generally stances I agree with. For me Becker remains the most obvious choice."
SaltLakeCity,3cgjhl,Deforesting,2,Tue Jul 7 22:01:11 2015 UTC,I'm just still so disappointed about the performing arts center. I think that his administration didn't see it necessary to check with the residents who will be paying for it speaks volumes.
SaltLakeCity,3cgjhl,Deforesting,3,Tue Jul 7 22:38:34 2015 UTC,"The performing arts center is definitely a stain on his administration, and it's a good enough reason not to vote for him. That being said I tend to prefer voting because I want someone in as opposed to wanting someone out, and I've yet to be convinced by any of the other candidates that they should be in."
SaltLakeCity,3cgjhl,biggywrecktion,2,Tue Jul 7 23:32:17 2015 UTC,"I would check out Garrott again, especially his speech at the Pioneer Park Council. I got to speak with him at a community event, and it is abundantly clear that he knows what he is talking about and would make a great leader. It is sad that the weakness in the campaign funding is probably because he does a lot of on the ground engagement, as opposed to parlaying with just the richest citizens of Salt Lake. A ton of Jackie's money, for example, comes from her promise to protect all of the golf courses in the city, despite the fact that every piece of data coming from the courses on current usage and costs show that they are unsustainable. But, as evidenced by this and the performing arts center, retail politics always trumps what is sensible for Salt Lake."

SaltLakeCity,3cgpc3,Yep-ThatsTheJoke,4,Tue Jul 7 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts, in general.  No mosquitos.  Seriously, having moved from a 95% humidity state (Michigan) the first things we noticed was that insects were few and far between, especially mosquitos.  That changes when you get up into the mountains or around lakes.  But in general where people live?  Practically nothing.  No house here has a bug zapper, let alone likely have ever heard of one.  Mountains are very nice and still pleasant to look at.  I've lived with them for 30 years now and I still find them a very pleasing skyline to have.  Four seasons.  We get hot summers, and cold snowy winters (this year we didn't get as much snow, but we still had a white Chirstmas).  It's dry.  Be prepared to invest in some decent moisturizer (I recommend Cera Ve from Walgreens.  Water based and doesn't feel like it's left a film).  You will see big giant cubes sitting atop everyone's houses. They are called ""swamp coolers"" and their sole purpose is to pump humidity into the houses.  You will definitely see a very high per-capita abundance of Mormon churches.  But, the ones who actually practice what they are taught are typically good and friendly, non-judgmental neighbors.  You do get some bad apples who forget their actual teachings, and it is unfortunate that they are the ones people tend to remember the most.    I don't personally drink, but my friends remind me that the alcohol content of beer here is less than can be found in other states.  The state also does not participate in any lotteries.  Like any city, you have your nicer areas and your rougher patches.  The cost of living is much lower here than many other states.   I enjoy it here and am happy to raise a family here."
SaltLakeCity,3cgpc3,Kulban,2,Tue Jul 7 20:09:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  That was a very well thought-out response.   The mosquitos are definitely something exciting for me. With the humidity here, southern MO is rife with the little bastards.   I spent about a week there last year and loved every minute of it. The mountains really are something to see. I never envisioned myself living in Utah, but the more I think about it, the more excited I get."
SaltLakeCity,3cgpc3,dbc45,2,Tue Jul 7 21:00:24 2015 UTC,"Hate to break it to you, mosquitoes are here. If you live East of the great salt lake within a couple of miles you'll have plenty of them. Salt lake is South of the lake so you should be okay there"

SaltLakeCity,3cgpc3,masterhydrator,5,Wed Jul 8 04:54:20 2015 UTC,"SLC is the next big ""cool place"" to live. You can move to Austin or Portland and have everything handed to you on a reclaimed wood plate or you can move here and find a place like Victor's tires ( a tire store with delicious tamales) that isn't done in an ironic hipster way, it's done out of the love of rubber and corn. You can be the one who moved here before it was cool. You can be the one to add to the cool place. You know the opening episode of Portlandia where the guy is in LA telling his friend how cool Portland is? It's like that here without half of the ridiculous shit that you actually don't want to put up with. Now, I only speak of SLC and Park City, the further in any direction you go the mor-religious it gets."

The first few months will be tough - up to a year but by the time you get a job & get some friends you will be happy. Too many people move back home after 6 months and they didn't give the place or themselves a fair shake. Also, one thing transplants do that annoys locals is talk about how great their last home was.

Most people who think they want to move to Austin really want to go New Orleans (for live music) or Salt Lake City (for outdoors and all other culture).   As for Portland, I'm not an expert but all my friends who've moved back to Oregon want to find a way to come back to Utah.  The only real downside to SLC: the jobs market (while not at all sleepy) is still not as ""hot"" as we claim it is, if you're looking to take your pick of top tech company. Unfortunately, Austin, Seattle, and Boston have us beat there..."
SaltLakeCity,3cgpc3,Incoherentrant,5,Mon Jul 13 02:10:46 2015 UTC,"Awesome job market, traffic is almost never bad, you can be in the mountains within like 20 minutes from downtown, if you ski we have some of the best skiing in the world, the people are super nice, you are 6 hours from moab/canyonlands and a lot of other national parks unlike anywhere else in the world. It really is a beautiful place and perfect if you like the outdoors, good music scene, burgeoning food scene.  Downside: crappy politics, weird liquor laws,  bad inversion in the winters, some strange cultural things based around mormonism.  I lived in Denver for 4 years, and I think in most ways SLC is a way better place. Except Denver has rad liquor stores and weed."

SaltLakeCity,3cgpc3,cab0addict,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:48:49 2015 UTC,"Salt Lake City is defined by high quality of life in general, almost regardless of income.   Everywhere you go there will be mountain views. Sunrises and sunsets are magical. You will thank god (or the flying spaghetti monster) you're alive and living in this place.  It is hot and dry. You're in the desert at 4,200 ft elevation. Salt Lake at 95 degrees and dry feels hotter than Texas at 105 and humid. But as long as you keep a hat on, keep the sunscreen coming, and drink lots of water, you'll be fine.  There are no insects to speak of.   Usually, your commute will be short and devoid of traffic.   Your employer will value family time, because 50% of his employees (and likely your boss) belong to a religion where family comes first, work on weekends is to be avoided, and work on Sunday is unacceptable.   Within 30 minutes of your house, you'll be able to ski 5 months of the year, and hike, bike, climb and boat the other 7. If you know where to go, most of these activities will be cheap or almost free.   Regarding hiking, the SLC area probably has the greatest variety of trails near any major metro area in the US. There are mountain, valley, lake and island trails, ranging from easy things you do with kids to overnight backpacking and advanced mountaineering.   You can attend top-notch programs at the symphony, opera, ballet, or see off-broadway shows, for a fraction of what it costs in other cities, and without having to purchase tickets in advance (unless you're trying to see ""The Book of Mormon"").   This was less true 10 years ago, but today you can walk downtown on a weeknight and hit up multiple bars with live music and completely different vibes. One lounge featured the Utah symphony orchestra playing chamber music -- that's something I never saw in Austin, TX!  Utah has a lot of good microbrews, their beers have names like ""Polygamy Porter"" and ""The Quorum of Twelve"" (for a 12-pack of Uintah beer). They're a bit expensive, but well worth it.   The coffee is phenomenal -- not just in downtown SLC but at hidden pockets in Greater Utah like Sunset Coffee in Sandy and Filler Up in Midway."

But there is a major difference living in Provo, and Salt Lake City. Provo is this place where everyone wear's suits. The people all look the same, and everyone references the book of mormon. The nights were eerily quiet, and the days passed as if I lived in the doldrums.

Yeah, you can buy mobile houses or pretty good motorhomes for not to bad a price. (Think a couple hundred a month range, like 20-50k to buy.)   When looking at the cost for where to place it, everybody I was looking at wanted $400-700 a month for 'pad' fees for it. This is on top of the price of your place. Now if you buy some land that's a decent option also, but that can easily push you back up in to the pad price range again. (But then you'll OWN the land and if you feel adventuresome, you can eventually build your own house to replace the mobile home.)   From friends that have lived in them, the older ones do not hold heat or keep out the cold very well. The newer ones aren't as bad on this, about as good as a not well insulated house."

SaltLakeCity,3c82ql,OliveTheory,2,Sun Jul 5 21:03:26 2015 UTC,"The Libertas Institute—a libertarian think tank in Utah—now reports that Utah lawmakers recently quietly and unanimously passed a bill that will gut the provision to reimburse property owners who successfully win in court, and to require prosecutors to file forfeiture cases in a timely manner. Libertas also argues that it will make it easier yet for the state’s police agencies to participate in the equitable sharing program.   Sounds like it still exists but it has been watered down. I wonder what the justification was, I'll have to look into this more when I'm at my computer. I think we have a libertarian lobbyist in this sub, too, maybe they can chime in with their perspective? Also does anyone know the bill name/number?   the changes gutting those reforms passed unanimously after only four minutes of discussion.   I do have a problem with this, because it's so blatantly untrue. You're telling me this bill was opened, introduced in the House/Senate, passed without anyone speaking to it, sent to the other chamber, passed without anyone speaking to it, and all in under four minutes? It doesn't work that way. Bill files are usually open for months, and everything's public, it's next to impossible to pass anything ""quietly."" And usually it takes more than four minutes even just to vote. And the idea that the House and Senate reading calendars would sync so perfectly as to allow this is comical. This is a serious issue and would be better served without the hyperbole."
SaltLakeCity,3c82ql,TheBadWolf,3,Sun Jul 5 22:49:11 2015 UTC,"I'm open to the possibility there's more to the story. To be honest, I grabbed the first story consisting of more than two paragraphs covering the topic. My main argument still stands, that a voter passed referendum was circumvented or superseded by lawmakers to further asset forfeiture.  It's crazy we ignore basic rights, like due process and unlawful seizure of property. I don't think there's any justification for this mentality. I won't pretend to know the legislative process well enough to determine whether four minutes is enough time for a vote. However, four minutes or four hours, it was still a flawed outcome if people's rights are dismissed.  Edit: I also found this explanation that covers some of the methods taken by Utah officials that bypassed the voter initiative."

I can't remember the exact percentage he got (I want to say 5% or 7% but I think they average around 3%), but the fact that they loaned to him at all was amazing.  His father had signed up for a bunch of credit cards under his name while he was still a kid, and never paid them off.  Add that to student loans and never having a way to build credit, and I'm amazed that his credit score wasn't just a frowny face. That said, everyone there was so helpful and went the extra mile to get him approved.  Personally, I applied for an account after being given a fraudulent check and having my entire savings cleaned out at Wells Fargo.  The Wells Fargo manager had to put me on a watch list and a ""deny service"" list- you know, all the fun ones.  But he sent me down to Utah First (where he personally banked), and they took my situation in stride.  They got me an account, when I would've been denied one elsewhere. Plus, I've never been treated but kindly and warmly there, especially compared to other banks (Wells Fargo, Chase, Zions) and credit unions (America First, Delta, American Fork) I've dealt with.   You have to open a savings account and maintain $50 in it, and join the Utah Community Volunteers (?) for $5, but that's it.  No fees, and wonderful people."

If you  pick up the Jordan River Parkway and head north, you'll hit the Legacy Parkway.  It's nice and flat, fewer road crossings (if any?).   You could ride all the way up to Farmington.  If you can muster the courage, Redwood Road down to Utah County is one of my favorite routes.   I like to start at 1300 west and Winchester and head south from there on 1300 west.   It curves around and hits Redwood at 14600ish south.  Camp Williams is a nice, steady climb.  Once you're over that it's flat all the way around Utah Lake.  Don't be afraid of hills.   Just go slow and keep pedaling.  If you're looking for a nice, welcoming group, check out Bonneville Cycling Club.  Nice people.   Very patient with beginners.

SaltLakeCity,3c9dt6,ExMorpheus,9,Tue Jul 7 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"Not to sound preachy, but if gas prices are high, consider alternative modes of transport. We have a growing public transport system that would continue to grow with greater, more robust ridership. Likewise, the city is building its bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure. Understanding that many people cannot practically use bicycles or walk, there is again the first option I proposed. Also, with poor (winter) air quality it seems we should be pushing for alternatives for a healthier city rather than complaining about gas prices."
SaltLakeCity,3c9dt6,AltaSkier,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:21:27 2015 UTC,"I got to agree a bit with this. The Wasatch front has some of the worst air pollution in the United States. We need to weaken our reliance on gasoline and increase our use of alternative energy, mass transit, and cycling.  I'm actually for increasing our fuel taxes (please don't hit me) but mostly because of how bad our transportation infrastructure is and we really need that revenue to upgrade it. Improving civil infrastructure is one of the few uses of tax revenue I'm always happy with."
SaltLakeCity,3c9dt6,varthalon,6,Tue Jul 7 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"Supply and demand; just simple economics. Utah refineries have existed for over a hundred years. Fuel refined along the wasatch front is consumed in Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana. It should be noted that demand for gasoline increases in summer with recreation and summer trips and such, causing an increased quantity of fuel demanded, and therefore a higher price in most cases. We can all collectively drive a lot less (like, all of us). source1 source2 source3 source4.  edit: wrong season"

SaltLakeCity,3c9dt6,ajfa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:39:32 2015 UTC,"At the risk of sounding pretentious, look into electric vehicles.   You can lease a Nissan Leaf for roughly $200/mo with $2k down. If you drive ~40 miles a day,  the impact on your electric bill will be $40/mo (roughly what a hot tub costs to run!). Or, if you work close to the downtown charging station, you can can charge it for free. I own two cash cars outright, but am considering moving to electric purely from a financial standpoint: I spend about $200/mo on gas and another $150/mo on repairs, oil changes, etc. Not to mention the time costs of having to take a car to the shop.    The downside: the Leaf has a low range of 80 miles. Everyone is waiting for the 2016 Leaf, which will likely have a 130+ mile range. Everyone is really waiting for the Tesla Model 3, which will have a ~250 mile range. Or, for Tesla and other EV manufacturers to announce common battery and charging standards, solving the range problem once and for all."

Just trying to understand why that is.
SaltLakeCity,3c9dt6,ajfa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:23:04 2015 UTC,"Well, you asked what we could do about it :)  Not sure -- maybe local gas stations have colluded to bump up the price?

More often then not gas prices have been below the national average. Just recently it has spiked though.  http://www.UtahGasPrices.com/retail_price_chart.aspx?city1=Utah&city2=USA%20Average&city3=&crude=n&tme=60&units=us  -edit- Western Refinery issues aren't helping either. http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2015/02/27/West-coast-refinery-issues-spill-over-to-pump/7681425043692/  I have a feeling come the end of the year prices will be back down again.

I'm sorry I don't know why gas is higher here and a few of the surrounding states and I also don't know who makes those decisions but I too would like to know why we have a refinery in our backyard and are among the highest prices in the nation."
SaltLakeCity,3c9dt6,TheBadWolf,6,Mon Jul 6 15:12:07 2015 UTC,I believe you misunderstood my point. My point is if we are all taking the brunt for fuel refining then we should at least be getting a deal at the pump. It's manufactured here. There are no transport fees and we have to deal with said consequences (extra pollution) I only drive 6 miles a day so frankly it doesn't affect my wallet but when I visit boston and NYC and see cheaper prices it makes me question why.
SaltLakeCity,3c9dt6,travel64,6,Mon Jul 6 05:50:33 2015 UTC,I've heard that the differential cost that exists here is because the fuel that is refined here is essentially only for this region. Essentially that the margins are small enough that transporting fuel outside of the region is cost prohibitive. Source: my neighbor that used to work for the Sinclair refinery system.
SaltLakeCity,3c9dt6,cmitchrun,0,Mon Jul 6 15:45:28 2015 UTC,There was a new tax passed in the last session which I believe is being used to fund air quality.  Prior to that it was extremely cheap.

The taxi cab companies threw a fit because they are required to meet certain standards and pay fees to be allowed to operate. The only real stronghold they have is the airport. You have to meet specific standards to get into the airport taxi area. So the city said uber/lyft are not allowed unless we meet those same standards, which as a part timer who does it only in my free time, it isn't financially lucrative to meet those standards.

I'd venture to say the same reason they can't go there is the same reason the TRAX system is required to take longer than the average taxi time from downtown to the airport.   No seriously. The taxi companies lobbied the city to put a speed limit on the TRAX system so they didn't get banished into irrelevance.

As far as I understand it, the airport issue stems from the fact that cab drivers pick up and drop off in areas not available to people who haven't gone through security, so drivers have to meet certain background check requirements. If I remember correctly, it's a federal regulation relating to security and not so much to do with the actual rideshare issue.   It's mentioned briefly in this one from March.  That isn't to say, as some posters mention, that you can't find a driver who may bend the rules to drop you off."

SaltLakeCity,3c2y4s,ekibnur,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:14:48 2015 UTC,"I can't give you official doctrine, but I can tell you what some actual mormons have told me.  I've lived in Utah all my life and I have definitely been told by LDS people that they prefer burial because that body is the one they will be resurrected in. I have no idea if there is an official stance on cremation.  However even if LDS people were never big users of a crematorium, it wouldn't surprise me if the non-LDS people (like say, the greeks) made use of one, or if one existed for health reasons or for people who couldn't afford a plot."
SaltLakeCity,3c2y4s,shanemhansen,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:27:53 2015 UTC,"That's a new one.  As far as LDS and cremation, all I can rely on is folklore about how ""you need your body to be whole when you are resurrected"" otherwise you'll be spread out all over the place, etc.  Likewise you are supposed to be buried with your feet towards the East so when Moroni blows his trumpet on that glorious morn, you'll pop up facing the sun.    Where in South Salt Lake?  I wonder if someone is confusing the old Vitro uranium refinery that was cleaned up in the 80s and turned into the sewage plant golf course with a massive crematorium?"
SaltLakeCity,3c2y4s,HatuutaH,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:31:07 2015 UTC,"Nope. It's the company I work at. Basically, the company legend (IE what they tell everyone) is that sometime prior to WW2, the location was the site of an old crematorium.  This belief is backed by the fact that apparently, until maybe 2005 or 2007, they had a pair of gas fired crematoriums on the property which dated back to 1930. Naturally, they weren't used as crematoriums in the 2000's though."
SaltLakeCity,3c2y4s,caligari87,0,Sat Jul 4 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth: I'm 28, a lifelong Mormon, and I plan on being cremated. It's apparently discouraged, and less popular among the older members (the folklore mentioned by /u/HatuutaH and /u/shanemhansen is accurate), but certainly not forbidden. I've not heard anything about any official bans on the practice prior to 1945 either; as far as I know it's always been up to personal preference.  You may have already seen this, but a Q&A article in the August 1991 issue of the Church's Ensign magazine reads in part:    Generally, Latter-day Saints in the Western world have felt that nothing should be done which is destructive to the body. That should be left to nature. Church leaders have counseled that only in unusual circumstances or where required by law should cremation take place. (General Handbook of Instructions, March 1989, 1–5.) [Note: this volume is not available to the public but can be found on various internet sites if desired] [...] Where there is no overriding reason to cremate, burial is still the preferred method of handling our dead. In the end, however, we should remember that the resurrection will take place by the power of God, who created the heavens and the earth. Ultimately, whether a person’s body was buried at sea, destroyed in combat or an accident, intentionally cremated, or buried in a grave, the person will be resurrected.   That's probably the closest you can find to an official, current answer, I believe."
SaltLakeCity,3c2y4s,HatuutaH,2,Sun Jul 5 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much.  This is one of the stranger legends I've taken under my scope, and the vague sense about it has been hard to track down any information. Much of what's been said in answer to the question has helped me better establish the grounds for where the legend may have started, and better serve to debunk it."

The fact that he refuses to have a Super-PAC is one reason I've donated so much money to him so far, and I plan to continue giving more as my budget permits and as we get closer to 2016.   He doesn't dodge questions or beat around the bush, from what I've seen in interviews. The only time I've seen him dodge questions was when he is prompted to attack other candidates specifically (he refuses to participate in the soap opera that is our U.S. political system nowadays). Instead he just says ""you should ask [insert name] that question, but what I would do is....""  He's also been on a program called Brunch with Bernie for at least since 2011 - fielding questions from his constituents every week or so for years. Politicians should answer to the people, and he is the only candidate who seems to get that.   The fact that he is relying on a purely grassroots movement to invoke a political revolution means his chances are a little slimmer, but I think enough people are fed up with the status quo right now. I believe, and hope, that the American people will eventually see all the good this guy could do for our country."

Edit - I didn't down vote you, /u/chemspiration, for the record, but yeah people use that button to agree or disagree.

Sanders will move enough media attention away from far right extremist, and give the far left more of a shot.   Sorry, It is late and I grammar things poorly. Basically if Bernie is elected we might have 4 years of no change, but afterwards we will have a strong stepping point for significant change. Notice how a good bipartisan president (Obama) didn't do a damn thing for negotiations between parties. When asked Obama said, There are congressman that find a political advantage in doing nothing. All republicans have to do is say ""see, we fought against Obama!"" and they win reelection. Now if we have a president who is so far to the left that he has no desire of negotiating with them maybe we can pull all the social issues to the fore and get them the media attention they deserve.  Just a thought."

SaltLakeCity,3bx9qw,dmarie229,2,Fri Jul 3 17:34:47 2015 UTC,"Ah. Yeah I am heavily invested in foreign policy and spend more time reading about it than anything else. With bernie, i feel like he has his bases covered in terms of policy goals domestically, but his policy on foreign intervention seems to be a bit more recedivist in that he apparently isnt  on board unless Europe gets on board. Thats not good considering Europe is  generally unwilling to engage in the Middle east much less deal realistically with middle eastern immigrant issues in their countries. In my opinion we are entering a time when global conflict is a real possibility. We need a preemptive and authoritative president willing to do the hard thing and nip issues in the butt instead of waiting for Europe to help. Just my two cents."

My only recommendation is Chess because it's obviously the best game ever invented. Also, I would come to drink and play games as long as it didn't turn into another hipster haven, bro bar, etc.         Also, maybe video games?

SaltLakeCity,3bwpe3,filologo,2,Fri Jul 3 09:56:18 2015 UTC,"My wife wants me to recommend Othello.        For a rowdy, quick game, I recommend Pit. It's a card game meant to simulate the old-style stock market trading. People trade stock cards (i.e. commodities such as wheat, barley, cocco, etc.) by yelling the number of cards they want to trade (not the type of card). The goal is to get all of the same type of card first.           Another quicker game, Mille Bourne would be great for this sort of setting. It's a card game in which players race while trying to screw each other. It can be one-on-one or teams, too.       For a longer game, I recommend Solarquest. It's very similar to Monopoly, but it's a bit more complex. For example, there is gasoline, route options, shooting (potentially blowing up) other players. It's awesome.       Edit: I forgot to explain what Pit is.."

SaltLakeCity,3bwpe3,blitzschmeiss,5,Mon Jul 6 01:17:38 2015 UTC,"Suggestions:         Let customers check out games by leaving IDs or credit cards, and when they open a tab.       Get a new game every week/month, and let customers vote on what it will be. Put a glass jar and paper on/near the bar, and offer a Joke or Drink Pen -- which, as the name suggests, is lent after the customer tells a joke or buys a shot. Also, have them direct their jokes at someone else at the bar to encourage introductions.         Laminate anything booze will ruin.       In big, bold letters write something on the box to the effect, ""Only stupid doo-doo heads steal communal toys"" or ""don't be 'that guy', don't steal games"".        Tournaments. All kinds of tournaments.      Every so often, offer a free drink to win a random game against a stranger. Just announce to the bar that anyone who wants to compete for a free whatever, needs to meet somewhere. Then, spin a thingy to determine the game (which will determine the number of players). Then, spin the bottle to determine who gets to play. (Note: you may want to pick fairly short games in case the strangers don't like each other).        Hmm... I have more ideas, but this is getting (way too) long. Let me know if you want more or if I'm just rambling idiocy.        Cheers."

SaltLakeCity,3bwpe3,segoGrape,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:58:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's a great idea! But I've been to a few bars that offered boardgames in other cities before and I wouldn't offer anything too technical or unusual. You're probably not going to attract too many serious gamers (but I could be wrong) and most of the people attracted will be casual gamers who like playing something familiar or quick and easy to learn. Bars tend to be loud, so it could be hard to explain the rules of a more complex game to a group of people. And pieces will go missing or get broken, including rule cards.   When I went to a bar in D.C. that offered a large selection of boardgames every night of the week, it was usually stuff that I remembered from being a kid: Connect Four, Trivial Pursuit, Apples to Apples, etc. Those are games that are easy to replace when they get ruined by someone spilling their beer all over it and most people are already familiar with them so they don't have to try and learn it on the spot. And they had multiple copies of Cards Against Humanity because that game is perfect for drinking. And it is popular. They had problems with people stealing it repeatedly so it was one of the few games they required collateral (an ID) to check out. Settlers of Catan would probably be a popular one. I think acuo had some good suggestions in his comments of games that could work at a bar.  Good luck! I hope it works out!"

And I repeat, no bus driver every passed me by.  Not once.  I was on a bus once where the driver seemed to not notice a patron, passed the stop slightly, noticed, and then stopped.  The person had to walk 20 feet from where the bus stop was to get on board.  THE HORROR!  Are you running up to the stop at the last possible micro second or something?  I've seen people do that and still the driver stops.  Are you hiding the the bushes?  Are you wearing all black and trying to get Night Ride?

SaltLakeCity,3bw22c,HatuutaH,0,Fri Jul 3 13:46:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't taken UTA in the few years, however the last time I was driven past was about two years ago, the 35 line.  Another incident a few years back on the line that leaves SLC from North Temple.  Both of those I thought could have been flukes, though since I was sitting on the bench directly next to the bus stop sign I wasn't sure how they didn't see me.     And it must frequently happened on the 811 line.  One incident where he drove past about 6 people at the stop, again, not sure how he could not have seen us.  Now keep in mind that the 811 was often full that time of day, and it wasn't unusual for the driver to pull up and tell us ""sorry, bus is full.""  Occasionally the driver would call dispatch and they would send another bus.  With a group that large we had yet to have the driver simply drive past, we were all stunned.  However, my personal favorite was when I started riding in the evenings of winter on line 811. I would get driven past quite often.  I racked my brain, ""maybe I'm at the wrong stop, maybe he can't see me, maybe they were full.""  After confirming my stop, calling UTA and confirming the bus wasn't full, and then purposefully standing touching the bus stop sign under the street lamp I started to get pissed.  The very last time it happened it was mid-winter, last bus of the night, and he drive past in the farthest left lane (no intention to stop at all).  I honestly chased him down and threw something at the bus; of course it played out like a movie scene where I was a good distance behind the bus, my throw missed, and I was left standing in the middle of the road.    It's wonderful that you have been able to ride for 30 years without incident.  But please do not discount other riders who have.  On each incident I called UTA immediately; they are fully aware of their problems, and hopefully have taken actions to prevent in happening to others.  Edit: I shouldn't say that I haven't ridden in a few years, I do take Trax regularly downtown, and the last time I had to use UTA as my primary form of transport was just over a year and a half ago and that is when the 35 line incident happened."

So far, my conclusion is that the buses are more reliable and comfortable than TRAX.    I think some people are irrationally prejudiced against buses, and assume that rail is the only worthwhile service UTA provides.  Actually, now that I think about it, that group probably includes the UTA Board of Trustees."

I have taken the train twice since that change.  Trip one: the trax I was on hit a car, trip two: a frontrunner that I wasn't on got stuck on the tracks and delayed other trains (mine) for hours.

I think that the transit coverage is really pretty good in Salt Lake, but a lot of the value in that is lost in the fact that most of the busses stop at like 8:30 PM and trax stops at 11:00 or something.

I'm not too much for going out super late on the weekends or anything, mind you.  Much as I can tell, if you live anywhere in SLC proper and work no more than a mile from the nearest TRAX stop or a good bus route being carless here is probably going to be easy enough for all but maybe 5-10 days a year.

Living and working downtown, particularly a few blocks from Trax was super easy. When I moved out to Sugarhouse, it was a little harder at times, but it mostly meant being more conscious of when I would do groceries and what I would buy.

SaltLakeCity,3bw22c,e-lishaphoto,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:22:53 2015 UTC,"It depends on where you live, where you want to go, how far you want to walk, and if you have a bike.  I live a couple blocks from a TRAX station and worked a mile from a FrontRunner station. That was very doable car-free with a bike.  The biggest issue you'll have to deal with is that you'll lose time due to increased travel time under some circumstances, fairly common delays, and that you have to live by UTA's schedule.  tl;dr - It's doable, but it depends."
SaltLakeCity,3bw22c,drivec,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:01:10 2015 UTC,"My sister in law did it for two years and we were just talking about it. It's hard.  Trax/Frontrunner is nice and predictable, but serves limited geography.  The buses are slow and you really have to decipher the system.  I think now in an Uber/Lyft world it might be easier.  I think in any circumstance, you'd have to be childless and live close to your work (or live and work close to Trax stations)."
SaltLakeCity,3bw22c,DesolationRobot,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"I hate that this makes me sound like I'm not an environmentalist or something, but it hasn't been a practical option for me. With the bus schedules here it seems like going anywhere ends up turning what could have been a 20 minute run to the store to a 2 hour round trip. I'm willing to do that on the weekends to go to the farmers market, but not to commute every day. Also, I have dogs and they get a long hike once a week. From what I read they aren't allowed on public transit unless they are in a kennel.  Not to mention that I think having access to a car is important for enjoying some of the outdoor stuff around here. I think you have to be pretty hard-core crazy to ride your bike all winter. I know people do it, but I'm soooo not baller enough to ride a bike through foot deep slush or on black ice.  I'd suggest doing some sort of ride-share and getting a bike, but I guess it all depends on where you live and what you do. It's definitely possible to avoid driving very often."

SaltLakeCity,3bxs2g,gbrownstrat,2,Fri Jul 3 01:06:03 2015 UTC,"As I learned from an article about the recent SCOTUS decision regarding redistricting,   http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/us/supreme-court-upholds-creation-of-arizona-redistricting-commission.html?_r=0  several states - even ""red"" states - have implemented bipartisan redistricting panels.  In AZ's case, it was by ballot initiative.  The controversy around the constitutionality of these commissions was settled mere days ago by a 5-4 majority, written for by Justice Ginsburg.  This seems like a decent idea to me.  I moved here to SLC from TX, where my district in Austin was gerrymandered to the nth degree, into a tiny strip of the middle of Austin all the way down to the Mexico border, 4 hours' drive south.  They called it ""the fajita strip"".  Obviously, creating a fair or representative district was not what they had in mind; rather it was more like a cynical game of political king-of-the-mountain, as all gerrymandering is, in my opinion.  In an already polarized country, gerrymandering seems to exacerbate problems of polarity and political monopolizing.  I'd love it if we could do something about it - something like implementing a redistricting commission.  Do you think this is possible in Utah?  It would have to be petitioned for as a ballot initiate, and then approved by voters.  I don't know without doing further research about how Utah's voting laws and constitutional amendment processes work, but I would be interested to learn.  I would be even more interested to contribute somehow to the cause, either by signing the petition or voting for the redistricting commission initiative."

I'd love to be able to help change the way things are (and will look into ballot initiatives), but I feel pretty cynical about anything working.

SaltLakeCity,3bvd63,HatuutaH,5,Thu Jul 2 13:33:14 2015 UTC,I just don't understand why UTA thinks its ok not to run a full schedule on July 3rd.  It is a normal work day for most people.
SaltLakeCity,3bvd63,Jekyllhyde,2,Thu Jul 2 15:20:00 2015 UTC,"It is in their contract with their employees.  They have to pay drivers, dispatchers, and any other hourly employee who works on July 3 holiday pay.  That's a spendy day for them."
SaltLakeCity,3bvd63,Michael_MDF,3,Thu Jul 2 16:08:53 2015 UTC,Yup. A lot of companies cut hours on the week of a holiday to balance it out. It's their way of getting around holiday pay.
SaltLakeCity,3bvd63,Jekyllhyde,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:09:42 2015 UTC,I have to pay all my employees holiday pay on the third too.  that doesn't keep me from running my business responsibly and taking care of my customers
SaltLakeCity,3bvd63,Jekyllhyde,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:00:44 2015 UTC,Good to hear you'll take a loss of profits so easily.  I wish more business owners had your attitude and respected their workers' rights to equitable treatment and fair pay on holidays etc.
SaltLakeCity,3bvd63,Jekyllhyde,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:46:50 2015 UTC,"I don't look at it as a loss of profit.  I build customer loyalty by providing consistent, quality service. That's what most all customers want.  Cutting service on a non holiday day doesn't make sense. If Friday was the 4th of July, I could understand holiday service, but it's not. It's just another day for most people taking public transport to work.  Oh well. UTA has to save money to pay their executives exorbitant salaries and bonuses."
SaltLakeCity,3bvd63,Syco00,2,Thu Jul 2 21:16:24 2015 UTC,But July 3 is the official holiday according to the federal government.
SaltLakeCity,3bvd63,pooldolphin,-1,Thu Jul 2 22:10:05 2015 UTC,"ok, but still, nobody celebrates July 4th on the 3rd. and only state and federal businesses will be closed. I assume that is why Trax is only providing Sat. service, even though a ton of people are still working."
SaltLakeCity,3bvd63,kalcy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"It's lame, but at least there will be service on Saturday. I don't think there has been uta service on the 4th before. So its a step forward there"

Black Hole at White Canyon is just near Hite Marina, not a long hike in from the road. TAKE A FLOTATION DEVICE, no exceptions. The water is 40f and it will shock your system. But its an amazing hike. 5 hours for the hike?  Paria River/Buckskin Gulch is probably 5 hr drive but it is amazing. Watch out for cesspools and take rope. hike is probably an all day er though."

SaltLakeCity,3brzne,boris-yeltsin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:29:25 2015 UTC,"Different cities have tried this over the years with minimal success, since unfortunately, enforcement is a nightmare. We used to hike into the foothills in Ogden on the 4th when I was in high school back when they banned just about anything bigger than a sparkler, and the whole city was nonetheless lit up with big aerial fireworks. The problem is that when Evanston is such a short drive from the Wasatch Front, people who really want fireworks can very easily get just about any type/size of firework they want with minimal effort.   I think this is why cities have been focusing more on letting people have smaller aerial fireworks in hopes that it keeps them satisfied enough not to go to Wyoming and buy massive rockets."

Should you have to? Hell no. When they do drop it back down to what it should be you'll also likely get the next 6 months at significantly cheaper than whatever rate you should be at and if there's a legit problem with the bill, then they'll credit stuff back to you.  Comcast sucks when it comes to maintaining a low monthly bill but 2 phonecalls a year to them will keep your bill nice and low. Small price to pay to not use CenturyLink's shit DSL or normally crap reliability with the local wireless carriers, for those of us outside of fiber service."

Last time mine went up, I called, got it dropped back and got free HBO. This is the dance you gotta play with Comcast...

If you aren't this, pick a commute time that is acceptable to you and look north of Draper from that commute distance, but don't live in draper because you will hate it. Avoid living in Taylorsville or West Valley if possible as well."
SaltLakeCity,3bt8b1,Deforesting,3,Thu Jul 2 00:44:20 2015 UTC,Came in to say this about Draper. Left satisfied.
SaltLakeCity,3bt8b1,Reiziger,2,Thu Jul 2 01:12:16 2015 UTC,"There are two areas of Draper that matter. I looked at buying a house around the suncrest area and here's what I didn't like:   Every house looked the same The whole place empties out at 9 and fills up at 5. I guess it's a typical suburb. Every ugly ass house is approx. 10cm from their neighbor's ugly ass house.   It's like people in Draper have a little money and have decided quantity is the same thing as quality. A colleague pointed out to me that there's another Draper. There's the old draper which supposedly isn't as bad. Also, they have some awesome mountain biking trails so it's not all bad.  Places to avoid: West Valley City. I swear I'm not just being judgmental. I bought my first house in SLC there. While it was nice to see non-white people and have delicious Vietnamese food, I quickly tired of having my house get robbed (twice) and living next to meth heads who needed to use my phone when one of them stayed up too many days and freaked out. The number of broken-down cars grocery stores was too damn high. I don't like shopping at places where the clerks act like I'm trying to steal something. I wasn't even living in a ghetto street for West Valley. I lived a few houses down from Larry Wiley (Democrat in the Utah State House of Representatives).  I live in Holladay now. They have a pretty sweet downtown with most things I need. We have a sprouts which is like a less-pretentious Whole Foods. It puts me pretty close to Trader Joes. It's nice to live so close to the ski resorts. The houses have character, and the running joke is that nobody ever leaves the neighborhood I live in. Unfortunately it's kind of expensive. It is super white. Watch out for entitled bratty teenagers driving sports cars when you go to the 7-11.  One thing to be aware of: I-15 north-south traffic is super bad due to Utah County people. Try really hard to avoid having to drive North in the morning or South at night. If you can stay off I-15 and stick to I-215/wasatch blvd you'll be much happier."
SaltLakeCity,3bt8b1,shanemhansen,2,Thu Jul 2 20:43:56 2015 UTC,"pretty much all the areas in and near draper are nice. a couple of neighborhoods in Sandy (just north of draper) are.. on the questionable side.. or just on the older side. if you are looking for houses online it's pretty easy to see how the area is by ""walking through"" it on google maps, imo."
SaltLakeCity,3bt8b1,pergn0ntits,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"I guess Midvale and NW Sandy are a little bit sketchy in places, but I wouldn't go as far as to call them ""questionable"". Maybe State St... but that's pretty sketchy everywhere!  In fact, if you want to be 15 minutes from downtown SLC, 5 minutes from the cottonwood canyons and 15 minutes from Draper, and get a house for a comparative bargain (<$100/ sq ft), you could do a lot worse than the Ft Union / north Sandy / Cottonwood Heights area. That area is a healthy mix of LDS and non-LDS, plenty of wards but also awesome coffee shops (Sunset Coffee), movie theaters (Century 16 Union Heights), bars (Bohemian Brewery, Hog Wallow). It's also the closest you can get to the ski resorts and BCC/LCC without living in Top of the World or Granite.    To give you an idea: in my subdivision near Flat Iron Mesa Park, none of my immediate neighbors is Mormon (myself included). Lots of young families, LDS or not. Homes go for around $250-350k. Sunset Coffee and Vasa are walking distance. 20 minutes to Alta. I gladly left Austin, TX to move back to Sandy, where ""Big Love"" was ostensibly set. For my money this is about as good as it gets in America.  If you're a cyclist, that whole area east of 13th E and south of 9400S is glorious. Depending on where you work in Draper, you could bike to work on 13th E."
SaltLakeCity,3bt8b1,ajfa,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:52:05 2015 UTC,"I like draper. It's nice, you're less than 15 mins from the canyons and that's all you need. If you decide to venture out for night life, downtown  is great for that. If you're interested in shopping, there's multiple malls/shopping centers within 10 minutes. If you're looking to live somewhere more single-friendly, find a place closer to the city. Or in the city. Commuting in salt lake REALLY isn't that bad, in comparison to other major cities. If you're into the great outdoors, welcome to a little slice of heaven! Don't mind the ones who hike up the bad reputation of ""super Mormon conservative"", yes it's here...but every state has its differences. The more you fight it and look for the bad, the more you will see it.   Edit: Additionally, anyone who says certain places are ""sketchy"", are people who have never experienced what sketchy actually means. These cities are full of more diversity, which means you're going to see someone who isnt white! If you come from a state that is more culturally bubbled than Utah, you might want to take these comments of which cities are sketchy, a little more seriously."

SaltLakeCity,3bptim,keastes,3,Wed Jul 1 18:29:51 2015 UTC,"bus at night   that's comedy gold right there. reason i use  the trax is, well, do have any clue how long it takes to get to the airport from 4500 south? i pretty sure i dont have the lifespan to find out."
SaltLakeCity,3bptim,Tannekr,2,Wed Jul 1 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"What do you mean, exactly? Bus, TRAX, and Frontrunner prices are all discounted, even if the discounts aren't the same."
SaltLakeCity,3bptim,titanicx,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the discount is not the same so therefore it charges you at different rates. You take a bus, it charges you 1.50$. You then tap off and transfer to a trax, it charge you an extra .50c. It's not that hard to understand. if you mix and match transportation types it fucks up your whole notion of how much you are being charged for a ride. If you read the previous article they put out this is part of their experiment possibly leading to a distance based fare."
SaltLakeCity,3bptim,Tannekr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:47:48 2015 UTC,Do you got a link to that or any article that talks about it more in-depth?

SaltLakeCity,3bptim,HatuutaH,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"Well, if you ride the bus first, your fare is only going to be $1.50 because of the transfer.  (I assume they aren't going to tack on 50 cents for getting on TRAX.)"
SaltLakeCity,3bptim,titanicx,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"Nope, when you tap off the bus and onto the train it charges you the extra for tapping on the train. And if you neglect to tap off the bus they charge you an extra 2$ or so for not tapping off."
SaltLakeCity,3bptim,HatuutaH,2,Wed Jul 1 18:29:07 2015 UTC,Yep not tapping off is a bad bad thing.  That sucks about the extra 50 cents.
SaltLakeCity,3bptim,Syco00,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:30:53 2015 UTC,"Just remember that as of right now this discount is only scheduled to be in effect until the end of the year. They might extend it, but might not."

SaltLakeCity,3bnrdg,theutahreview,3,Tue Jun 30 19:50:33 2015 UTC,How do you deal with cherries and fruit flies? Or any bugs in fruit in general?  I didn't notice that my cherry tree was compromised until late in the season last year when the larva were larger and more visible. Western Cherry Fruit Flies are probably in every single cherry tree in Utah if the tree isn't sprayed regularly.
SaltLakeCity,3bnrdg,overthemountain,2,Tue Jun 30 18:27:19 2015 UTC,"We work closely with USU's Extension program in many ways. They have a wonderful Pest Management Guide that we use often.

SaltLakeCity,3bnrdg,overthemountain,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:38:24 2015 UTC,"So would you guys take care of the fruit flies? You're welcome to my cherry tree with or without the flies. I actually have an apple tree that I haven't really tried to harvest before due to pest as well. I have an apricot tree, too, that one seems to do fairly well on it's own. I actually have a bunch of mulberry trees in the back, as well, but those are a massive pain to pick and I don't know how much people really eat them."

SaltLakeCity,3bnrdg,kirkbenge,3,Tue Jun 30 21:34:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean, think of it... the worms are technically made out of cherry, right?  Still, finding 3 or 4 little rice sized larva is pretty unappealing."

SaltLakeCity,3bpaja,iki_balam,6,Thu Jul 2 04:08:56 2015 UTC,No one here pays you for your glass. In fact you have to pay to have it recycled if you want one of the glass recycling cans at your home.  Some breweries will accept glass for free if you take it to them. Uinta used to have a giant dumpster for you to throw glass in .  This isn't like other states that have a glass bottle deposit.  It has no value whatsoever here and only costs people money to process.
SaltLakeCity,3bpaja,Piscea,4,Wed Jul 1 13:23:53 2015 UTC,"On a side note, does glass really need to be recycled?  Are we running out of sand?  Does the recycling process use less energy than creating new glass?"
SaltLakeCity,3bpaja,DiscoHippo,7,Wed Jul 1 18:25:54 2015 UTC,"You have to mine the materials for new glass like pot ash and soda lime, so yes, recycling it does save energy required to produce it, as well as reduces the amount of pollution that is created when heating the raw material to high enough temperatures to create the glass. You can recycle glass 100% repeatedly, again and again."

SaltLakeCity,3bosxn,UNORIGINALUSERNAME88,7,Tue Jun 30 22:51:02 2015 UTC,"The weber has far more little rapids, obstacles, and drops/rocks to avoid.  The Provo is mostly very slow and leisurely with very little excitement.  The weber is by far my favorite, but I love the excitement. A lot of people don't like getting so banged up on the river, but a big part of it is just watching the river and paddling out of the way of obstacles. As someone else posted, Barefoot tubing is the rental company for the weber river. You can rent tubes, life jackets or a shuttle ride.  https://highcountryadventure.com/tubing/ is the rental company for the Provo.  For the weber you put in at exit 112 and park at exit 108 (2-3 hour float, depending if you get out of the water to hang out). If you want a longer float you can float all the way back to barefoot tubing.  If you buy your own tubes, the intex river runners are the best bang for your buck. Have fun!"
SaltLakeCity,3bosxn,iamthelashtoneofthem,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:19:07 2015 UTC,"Would you say it's better renting, or buying tubes?"
SaltLakeCity,3bosxn,rathulacht,2,Wed Jul 1 19:08:08 2015 UTC,"If you're going to be floating a lot, buying is the way to go. The intex river runner costs $20 and to rent is $25 I think. To just rent a life jacket is $5, although you can buy one of those cheap orange life jackets for $5-10.  Although, keep in mind the rental tubes are far less likely to pop.  Personally, I prefer to buy."
SaltLakeCity,3bosxn,iamthelashtoneofthem,4,Wed Jul 1 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"I've only done the Weber. It's a lot of fun! Bring sunscreen and reapply a few times. It's the law to wear a lifejacket, and sometimes cops will set up ""checkpoints"" and give tickets to people not wearing one. I've only seen it happen once though. I've also heard of cops waiting for people to leave and then tailing them and getting them for drinking and driving, so beware of that if you guys want to drink. Also, there's a bridge you pass under and you want to stay towards the right because there's a pipe on the left side that can make things difficult."

SaltLakeCity,3bosxn,jortr0n,3,Tue Jun 30 23:12:45 2015 UTC,"I've floated both the Provo and the Weber. Weber is my favorite, A bit more water and rapids. Plus floating right under the Devils Slide is pretty cool.  The cops will ticket you without a jacket but you can rent on the cheap from places like REI.   You'll hop the river in Henefer and get out in Taggert. It'll be around 2-3 hrs, closer to 3 if you get out at some sandy parts to get a break."
SaltLakeCity,3bosxn,HatuutaH,3,Tue Jun 30 23:32:21 2015 UTC,"Wasn't there a company doing Weber floats?  They'd get you the right equipment and then pick you up when you reached the end.

SaltLakeCity,3bosxn,bandaidtanlines,2,Tue Jun 30 23:26:25 2015 UTC,"If you end up floating the Weber, try your best to avoid the big posts holding up a bridge or whatever it is. Hitting one seriously ruined my day."

A good place will show you the apartment you're moving into when you pick up your keys, but as far as I know there's no obligation for them to let you inspect the actual unit before you sign."

SaltLakeCity,3bnf6e,agilla,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:13:51 2015 UTC,If that's the case you should look into legally disowning in her. I don't know much about it but that would probably keep you legally safe from filial responsibilities.
SaltLakeCity,3bnf6e,Maikudono,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:17:12 2015 UTC,"you are only responsible for care debt if you sign as the responsible party   No, this law applies irrespective of if you signed anything.

SaltLakeCity,3bnf6e,HatuutaH,3,Tue Jun 30 19:14:30 2015 UTC,The scarier thing than this vestigial law hanging around is that this is exactly the kind of crap system Republicans want to return us all too.  Old and poor?  Your kids or other family must take care of you.  Your kids or other family don't want to have anything to do with you or you don't have any?  Tough shit.  Die in the gutter!
SaltLakeCity,3bnf6e,tehlaser,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:40:01 2015 UTC,"That makes me wonder what ""called upon"" means. There doesn't appear to be any context. What you quoted is chapter 2 of title 17 section 14, but it is also the entirety of section 14. There is no chapter 1 or 3. Was it partially repealed or something?"
SaltLakeCity,3bnf6e,varthalon,2,Tue Jun 30 18:31:51 2015 UTC,"Actually 14 is the chapter. 1, 2, and 3 would be sections. There never was a section 3. The chapter was only two sections. Section 1, back in 1933, read:   Every poor person who shall be unable to earn a livelihood in consequence of a bodily infirmity, idiocy, lunacy or other unavoidable cause, shall be supported by the father, grandfathers, mother, grandmothers, children, grandchildren, brothers and sisters of such poor person, if they or any of them be of sufficient ability: and if any person shall fail or refuse to support his or her father, grandfather, sister or brother, having the ability to do so, when directed by the board of county commissions of the county where such poor person shall be found, whether such relative shall reside in the same county or not, and the burden of supporting such poor relatives shall fall upon the county, such relative shall forfeit and pay to the board of county commissioners for the for the use of the poor of the county such sums as may be by the board of county commissioners deemed adequate and proper to be paid, not exceeding $20 a month for each and every month during which the county may be charged with the support of such poor person; provided, that whenever any person becomes a pauper from intemperance or other bad conduct he has not be entitled to the support from any relative except parent or child.   Additionally, chapter 2, until 1977 also included a final clause that it did not apply if    that a married woman shall not be liable in an action for such maintenance beyond the income of the estate of such married woman held in her own right.""   In other words guys had to pay for their poor relatives. Women only had to pay if they were independently rich.     The last time 17-14-2 was touched by the legislature was in 1977 when the ""married woman"" provision was removed to make it more gender neutral (a mighty blow of equal rights I'm sure).  The quote of section 1 I gave is from the 1933 Utah Code, so I imagine that $20 limit was revised at several points beyond that but I'm not sure when 17-14-1 was repealed or why.     Basically the whole point of Title 17 Chapter 14 is that families should be responsible for taking care of each other if at all possible before putting the burden on the government and, subsequently on everyone else. I kind of agree with that... why should my tax dollars go to taking care of somebody else's sick relative just because they are to much of a douche to do the right thing themselves.   However, standing alone section 2 doesn't make that clear and it sounds now like private companies could sue you for your family's debts. However there is no case law I could find where that has ever happened in Utah and I suspect the fact that this section is in Title 17 which is county government powers and responsibilities, is enough to keep it from being used out of it's missing context.   I suspect with medicaid 17-14-2 doesn't really apply anymore and is probably just left there in case someone refuses to get medicaid to shield the county government from potential debts."
SaltLakeCity,3bnf6e,HatuutaH,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:40:36 2015 UTC,It means you are responsible for caring for the person and the state can force you to do it.  The law does the calling upon the responsible relative.  Quaint 19th century verbiage.

To take your car exactly as this but throw a diesel engine in it you would get better efficiency, that's a fact.   And even if we are focusing on the truck, if that truck were to be a gas engine it would be even worse efficiency.   You can't say diesel is bad because your gas car gets better gas mileage than a diesel truck.

Also, there are some fairly clean burning gas engines as well - such as Partial Zero Emission Vehicles (70% of the time it burns clean every time), Low, Ultra Low, and Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicles.  Also, efficiency and emissions are two different things (which I'm sure you know, but the two seem to be thrown around a little haphazardly).  Ultimately, I don't know if anyone is trying to denigrate diesel engines in general. I know I don't have a problem with them, generally speaking.

SaltLakeCity,3bk6x5,kirkbenge,3,Tue Jun 30 06:34:03 2015 UTC,Carcinogenic is the word you want. Compounds with cancer would be an interesting development.
SaltLakeCity,3bk6x5,urbansessions,4,Tue Jun 30 17:37:23 2015 UTC,"As a CNG vehicle owner, I concur."
SaltLakeCity,3bk6x5,greygizmo,34,Mon Jun 29 23:12:12 2015 UTC,"What pisses me off is that there's absolutely zero performance gain from doing this. The engine burns super rich resulting in a loss of power and lots of soot. They are sacrificing the performance and efficiency of their vehicles to ""make a statement"".  You can - and should - report these fuckers using the forms linked in here. If I were in charge I'd revoke their licenses permanently. We have enough air quality issues already, there's no need for some dimwits with small penises to make it worse."
SaltLakeCity,3bk6x5,SimpleGeologist,8,Mon Jun 29 23:22:57 2015 UTC,"There is a power advantage, but a loss in efficiency. Internal combustion engines don't achieve max power at stoichiometric air/fuel ratios. This is why you see sled pullers and drag diesels blowing thick black smoke. Gasoline vehicles run just as rich in the same conditions.   That being said I don't see any reason to have a vehicle tuned to run so dirty on the highway."
SaltLakeCity,3bk6x5,dmarie229,7,Tue Jun 30 04:13:40 2015 UTC,"I think you're mistaken. They don't ""roll coal"" in an effort to increase performance. It's a side effect of increasing the amount of fuel sprayed by the injectors. i.e. When you accelerate hard, more fuel is used, resulting in more exhaust fumes.   They are sacrificing the performance and efficiency of their vehicles to ""make a statement"".   Sacrificing efficiency, yes. As with fast acceleration of any vehicle. It's just more apparent in a diesel"
SaltLakeCity,3bk6x5,Gasngo21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:12:52 2015 UTC,"They drive a pickup that gets maybe 15mpg, I don't think the people who drive those are concerned with efficiency."
SaltLakeCity,3bk6x5,MajSARS,0,Tue Jun 30 15:15:54 2015 UTC,There are different performance enhancements you can put on a Diesel engine. You can get some improvements from increasing the fuel input such as better torque which leads to better fuel mileage. But in the case of the dodge in op's picture they way overdid it and are now burning way too much fuel for it to be viable.

The thing is a 6 speed manual, so he just runs through the gears, and it spits some smoke at the low end. He's just a 70 year old man that loves his truck. He's put about 20k in maintenance in the thing over it's life time. 5-6k in just paint work. I swear, the thing should be in a car show, but it still does this."

There are a handful of climbing gyms in the valley, most notably the two Momentums (Millcreek and Sandy) and The Front (downtown-ish near I-15). The Front also has an Ogden location and I'm spacing on the name but there's another gym down in Orem/Provo IIRC.  Both Momentums have fantastic sport climbing facilties and also have bouldering sections. The Front in SLC only has bouldering right now, but is set to finishing their new building sometime in the fall which will have sport climbing as well."

I suppose they could, as long as it is fine with UTA's Legislatively approved charter, but that would be up to the individual city or county, as well as the currently participating cities/counties.   I doubt that Salt Lake City (the biggest payee in the system) is going to want to take on another debtor county/city, however.  Perhaps if cities/counties paid their fair share, there would be more incentive to have a bigger system.    In any case, changing UTA's name now  would be a pretty expensive proposition."

SaltLakeCity,3bk0oj,Darth_Squid,12,Mon Jun 29 21:14:59 2015 UTC,"I moved to NYC from SLC. Obviously, I like NYC more, but mostly because the career options are astronomically better in NYC.  Things that are better in SLC  Weather: it's hot, but it's a dry heat. Also, it smells considerably better. You can also fairly easily alleviate your suffering by going to the mountains or something, which is hard to do in NYC.  Outdoor shit: I don't like the outdoors myself. I figure if you've seen one red rock you've kind of seen them all. But others disagree with me, of course. If you genuinely like the outdoors and want to constantly go hiking in the summer, or skiing in the winter, SLC is the place for you. A ton of stuff is very close to the city as well, probably within ~30 minutes of driving. Most national parks are a few hours away and hot as hell. People pretty easily make it down there for the weekend, however.   Cost of living: obviously, SLC is cheap as hell. Aside from rent (you can get a decent condo downtown for barely $300k), even small things like chicken breast are like half the price that they are in NYC.  Driving: pretty necessary in SLC, which could be a good or a bad thing. Of course, this necessitates buying a car, getting auto insurance, etc. It is, however, pretty much mandatory if you live anywhere except the immediate downtown area. People may tell you you can get around by public transport or biking, but those are goddamn lies.   Things that are worse in SLC  Public transportation: this absolutely sucks compared to NYC. It costs the same but is about 1/10 as convenient. If you live in most neighborhoods, you will have to drive to the Trax stop itself, and then take the train, which will take forever because it stops at every red light.   Food: the food in SLC is ok, but nothing compared to NYC. It does depend on what you like to some degree. NYC obviously has a huge advantage in fine dining, which narrows as you go down in price. I mean a hot dog is a hot dog, pretty much wherever you get it. I will say that SLC has like no hot dog stands though, and the ones they do have (Red Hot and World Dog) are pretentious while being being more expensive and tasting worse than any Papaya Dog ripoff.   Culture: I mean, there is culture in SLC. You can go to the symphony, the opera, see some art exhibits, whatever. But it will be infinitely worse than NYC, and your options will be very limited. The performances here are obviously of a lower quality. Again, though, everything will cost far less (especially symphony/opera).  Regardless of what music you like, you are guaranteed to see more bands come through NYC. I'm into punk and heavy metal, and I've seen a ton of bands in NYC that would never come to SLC.   People: you'll never find the Harvard, Yale, Princeton crowd in SLC. But on the other hand you'll never find the Harvard, Yale, Princeton crowd in SLC.  Bars: everything in Utah closes at 1 AM, on the dot. I personally don't see a need to stay out until 4, but in Utah you'll never even have the chance. The average bar is considerably cheaper than in NYC, though.  Final thoughts  It really depends on what you like to do. If you're mostly a guy who likes to stay in, play vidya, see movies, etc. I don't know why you'd stay in NYC when you could do it all in Salt Lake at a fraction of the cost. If you really like the outdoors, go for SLC as well.   If you like to go out and live it up, or if you love the arts, NYC is the clear choice.  But if I'm perfectly honest, part of the reason I had to leave was that I felt that I could never feel truly accomplished in SLC. If had stayed there, I think I would always think ""what if..."" There would always be the sense that I'm in a small pond. I feel like once I make it in NYC, I will legit be at the top of my field. That's very personal to me, obviously.  EDIT: if you want to raise kids or something, NYC schools are much better. Granted, you get shit like lotteries to even apply to the best preschools, but the school system as a whole (from what I've gathered bytalking to parents) is much better. In SLC, you get losers paying like $30k/year for Waterford, and their kids don't even get into shitty Ivies like Cornell."
SaltLakeCity,3bk0oj,IgnacioLopes,3,Mon Jun 29 22:16:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty good summary, but I'd like to say:   People may tell you you can get around by public transport or biking, but those are goddamn lies.   It's really not, but you do need to be living in the actual SLC city limits and preferably on the east side. I have a car, but I rarely use it unless I want to get somewhere really really quick. I commute every day on my bike into downtown and so do quite a few of my coworkers (all living between downtown and sugarhouse, though).  So, I'd say, if you're moving from a big metro area, definitely live within the SLC limits (not the 'burbs) and the closer to downtown, the more you'll probably like it. Unless of course you don't care about having to drive. Then, live wherever, I guess."
SaltLakeCity,3bk0oj,brockobear,6,Tue Jun 30 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"Moved from San Diego to SLC, so not New York level of metropolis, but it did take some adjustments. Some rambling thoughts in no particular order:   People make eye contact on the street, still kind of weirds me out. Almost Everyone is white. People are friendly, not like mayberry friendly, but will generally answer a question instead of ignore you. There is not much violent crime, and it shows in the way people act, they lack a certain wariness you see in a lot of larger cities. The alcohol laws are strange verging on arcane, you can tell how long someone has been here by how they react to the laws, new people gape in disbelief, natives or long term transplants just roll their eyes. Outside of downtown, there isn't a whole lot of pedestrian friendly neighborhoods, if you want something or want to do something you hop in a car. Be prepared for allergies. Air pollution in winter is much worse than anything you'll encounter in NYC. Quite a few natives un-ironically like big cars, big families, and big gun collections. it's harder to get a drivers license than a conceal and carry permit for a gun."

SaltLakeCity,3bk0oj,AltaSkier,3,Tue Jun 30 05:49:47 2015 UTC,"I lived in SF and Paris before I moved to SLC. I thrive on being outside so living in SLC has been great for that - biking, hiking, and especially skiing. I love the outdoor culture in Salt Lake. The city has a quirky underbelly too of alternative types that are more real and less cynical than in SF or (especially) Paris. The downsides are there is no nightlife thanks to dumb alcohol laws and the restaurant scene is pretty small - but growing.   Socially, it's pretty hard to break in because native Utahns (ex-Mormons) are a pretty insular bunch. So it's necessary to find friends in SLC who have had broader horizons. That said, and as I said above, he city has some really cool, unique individuals who are definitely worth getting to know.   I'm about to finish my MS at the U of Utah and I'm willing to stick it out a bit longer despite of its downsides. I can't get over the fact that skiing is 45mins from my place downtown."

SaltLakeCity,3bk0oj,AltaSkier,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:11:37 2015 UTC,Not a dumb question. You go take a lesson at one of the resorts. That is the best way. Group lessons are a good way to learn and meet people. They often come with rental skis or a snowboard and a day pass.
SaltLakeCity,3bk0oj,shanemhansen,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:20:26 2015 UTC,"Alta has a deal for rentals for beginner the afternoon at $25 and the rope tows on all the easiest pitches out front of the area are always free all the time. I've had friends come, I've shown them the basics there and then they've taken an afternoon lesson with an instructor. Also, at Alta the beginner lifts are just $5 after 3pm or you can pay $25 for the season just to use the beginner lifts after 3pm. It provides a good way to start."
SaltLakeCity,3bk0oj,Wash_yo_dick_boy,3,Tue Jun 30 22:20:49 2015 UTC,"One of my friends moved to SLC from NYC, and he's pretty vocal about how much he likes the change. I think his worst criticism ever was one weekend he was bored, a feeling he'd never had in NYC. Most weekends his facebook feed is an annoying feed of ""Rock Climbing is so awesome, today I lead climbed a crazy place 15 minutes from my house!"" or ""skiing is so awesome"" the world's best skiing is 20 minutes from my doorstep or ""mountain biking is so awesome"" or ""my house is crazy cheap"".  Here's what I like about Salt Lake City (disclaimer: I live in what people around here call a suburb because it's 20 minutes from city center, it's also literally at the opening of Big Cottonwood Canyon).   I don't like crowds or traffic. I don't like going for a week without seeing the sun (something that actually happened last time I was in Chelsea). I do like looking out my front door and seeing rock climbers on the mountain. I do like snowboarding. 'nuff said. I like being close to Moab. I like the cost of living. I have a +3k square foot mid-century modern home that's in the same neighborhood as a NFL football player. 355k. I like the economy. SLC is great for tech. jobs and startups. imho the ratio of what you'll get paid vs what you'll need to spend is unbeatable. I find more than enough activities that I enjoy. From meetups to concerts to museums. That's not to say it's the same as NYC, it's not. There's plenty of good food. Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, and Greek are all pretty well represented. Commutes are short (in time, not distance). In the valley if you work 40 miles away from your home you have a 30 minute commute (hopefully you don't live quite that far away from work, but you get the point). I like having smart people around. Almost every meetup I go to is populated by Phd students at the U and engineers. I like that.   Things that I don't care about (that you might) that might be worse:   The dating pool/scene for meeting people (I'm married) There's lots of mormons (I'm not one). Their effect on local politics sucks. The bar scene (not my thing)   Things that suck:   Public transportation Local politics Inversion   Random Observation:  People in Utah are less in-your-face aggressive. Some people hate it because they think Utahn's are passive aggressive. New Yorkers are more blunt. The concensus I've heard is that people in Utah are polite, but cold.  Also, if SLC isn't your cup of tea, try Denver."

SaltLakeCity,3bkvdc,mountain__pew,2,Tue Jun 30 02:29:30 2015 UTC,"Dispersed Camping Many people enjoy the solitude and primitive experience of camping away from developed campgrounds and other campers. Dispersed camping is the term used for camping anywhere in the National Forest outside of a designated campground. Dispersed camping means no toilets, no treated water, and no fire grates are provided.  Camping in dispersed areas on the Forest is allowed for fourteen (14) days in any thirty (30) day consecutive period.  Campers must move off Forest after reaching the 14-day limit.  The stay limit also applies to all camping equipment (tents, chairs, ATVs, ATV trailers, etc.), even if used by a different person or group.  Camping equipment must be removed by the end of the fourteen (14) day stay limit or the equipment may be impounded.  Stay limits are implemented to reduce impacts to vegetation and wildlife habitat, as well as provide access to popular campsite areas for other visitors.

SaltLakeCity,3ber55,GreatWhite_Buffalo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:34:28 2015 UTC,"Gas flare:       A gas flare, alternatively known as a flare stack, is a gas combustion device used in industrial plants such as petroleum refineries, chemical plants, natural gas processing plants as well as at oil or gas production sites having oil wells, gas wells, offshore oil and gas rigs and landfills.  In industrial plants, flare stacks are primarily used for burning off flammable gas released by pressure relief valves during unplanned over-pressuring of plant equipment.      During plant or partial plant startups and shutdowns, flare stacks are also often used for the planned combustion of gases over relatively short periods.  A great deal of gas flaring at many oil and gas production sites has nothing to do with protection against the dangers of over-pressuring industrial plant equipment. When petroleum crude oil is extracted and produced from onshore or offshore oil wells, raw natural gas associated with the oil is produced to the surface as well. Especially in areas of the world lacking pipelines and other gas transportation infrastructure, vast amounts of such associated gas are commonly flared as waste or unusable gas. The flaring of associated gas may occur at the top of a vertical flare stack (as in the adjacent photo) or it may occur in a ground-level flare in an earthen pit. Preferably, associated gas is reinjected into the reservoir, which saves it for future use while maintaining higher well pressure and crude oil producibility.

SaltLakeCity,3ber55,The_Crass-Beagle_Act,13,Mon Jun 29 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"Number 2 actually sounds like the optimal scenario for the Wasatch Front. Northern Utah is now very much a region that is very much trying to shift its economy away from heavy, dirty industry like refining and mining towards high-tech industry like software development and biomed research. Frankly, the refineries bring a limited amount of jobs to the economy while pushing most of the revenue towards large oil companies based outside of Utah, and they make the air quality on the Front insufferable, which is a big turn-off for cleaner industry investors looking to implant in the state.   Maybe eliminating the refineries in one fell swoop would be a poor idea, but I think that they are something that we would ideally want to remove from our back yard in the coming 10 or 20 years."

SaltLakeCity,3ber55,Jameseatscheese,-8,Mon Jun 29 22:12:21 2015 UTC,"That's a terrible idea. It would cost a ridiculous amount of money to move those. The refineries would never agree to front the cost themselves, and there is no way the state could provide a significant portion of subsidy money to do it.  Literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Moving or constructing a refinery is on a completely different level than normal types of buildings. The equipment in a refinery is a much much higher cost than the buildings or land, and moving it is no simple task."
SaltLakeCity,3ber55,o0MetalHead0o,2,Sun Jun 28 19:21:30 2015 UTC,"A huge part of the cost would be rehabilitating the terrain.  The industry has such an impact on the land that heavy clean up is required. This is one reason why no one pushes to close them -- you can't just lock the front door and leave. The refineries will eventually have to pay these costs. Sooner rather than later, if you ask me."

Most refineries and coal-fired power plants are like 50+ years old, they represent billions of dollars, not to mention a massive amount of jobs. Coal-fired power plants provide like 80% of our electricity as well, and they provide they baseline load which things like solar and wind aren't great at doing right now.

SaltLakeCity,3bb81j,jortr0n,16,Sat Jun 27 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"Title's a little misleading. The bill is a proposition to remove government involvement in licensing marriages, as I understand it.   It won't pass anyway."
SaltLakeCity,3bb81j,theanedditor,3,Sat Jun 27 21:30:04 2015 UTC,What's the negative effect of taking government out of marriage? To me it makes no sense that they have any involvement in the first place but now that affects taxes and I'm sure a ton of other things. Anyone have any insight here?
SaltLakeCity,3bb81j,Opouly,23,Sat Jun 27 22:51:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are a ton of other ""things.""  There are literally thousands of laws relating to marriage.  Everything from spousal benefits of fallen soldiers to tax benefits to child custody to insurance to inheritance.  The laws concerning marriage are some of the oldest, most numerous, important laws in our everyday life; so much so that people often take them for granted.  Setting aside the significant spiritual and romantic side of marriage, becoming married is a fundamental change in one's personal status.  If the government can't discern who is married and who is not, then it is completely handicapped in the distribution of services and collection of taxes.  If you take the government out of marriage, it would be one of the most disruptive and significant changes in the history of American or western law.  The legal foundation of one of society's most important institutions would be destroyed and countless lives would be thrown into uncertainty, chaos, and destitution.  For some reason, a small libertarian narrative has gained traction that marriage is somehow completely alien and misplaced in government and law.  I can't imagine that whoever invented this narrative has any grasp of history, law, or the day-to-day reality of marriage.  Saying that the government can't define marriage is like saying the government can't define ""life.""  Sounds good when you're high, but not so good when you're being murdered or trying to visit your spouse in the hospital."
SaltLakeCity,3bb81j,first_past_the_post,2,Sun Jun 28 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"We don't know that the bill would do that. Perhaps all they're doing is getting rid of judge or justice of the peace type marriages where a state official actually performs the ceremony. Utah would still recognize marriages, including same sex marriages, performed by churches (or by something like a notary public, if a non-religious option is required).  That could plausibly be called getting the state ""out of the marriage business"" while having almost no actual impact.  Edit: another possibility would just be to rename all marriage to civil union, as far as the state is concerned. Let the churches proclaim a couple ""married"" but the state only recognizes a civil union, regardless of the sexes."
SaltLakeCity,3bb81j,tehlaser,3,Sun Jun 28 15:31:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah but just because the government does recognize it for certain things doesn't mean it should, right? It just seems so odd to me that the government should care about it."
SaltLakeCity,3bb81j,Opouly,7,Sun Jun 28 02:24:36 2015 UTC,"Blinding the law to marriage would be like blinding law to the concept of property.  On the most abstract level, it may seem odd that the government cares who owns which house and who is married to whom.  But the concepts of ownership and marriage are so deeply imbedded in our society that the law simply cannot function, or at least function properly, if it pretends that they don't exist."
SaltLakeCity,3bb81j,first_past_the_post,8,Sun Jun 28 02:41:42 2015 UTC,"Just because it's inconvenient or difficult for you to think about civil law, tax incentivization and ERA protections in a context that's friendly to non-traditional cooperative cohabitation arrangements doesn't mean it's infeasible. Seriously - uncertainty, chaos and destitution? Nobody is suggesting we throw out the institution and just see what happens. Custody, estate planning, inheritance, hospital visitation, power of attorney, property division, etc. - these are all simple matters of civil law. You assume we can't function without experiencing them as a component of marriage, but by making blind assumptions about how these things should work based on a historical context or marriage we engender expensive legal ambiguity. People should have to make difficult decision about matters of family law - for themselves - and in so doing shouldn't be limited to the government's assumptions about your romantic relationship.  Also, it's not a ""libertarian"" movement, that's a gross oversimplification of a complex issue. Family law reform is a very real issue, not a fringe issue championed by some goofy anti-government clowns with a hidden conservative agenda (yes, I know that's not what real libertarianism is, yes we all know it's what popular libertarianism has become... it's the ""hipster"" accusation of culture war-oriented politics.) In fact, effective family reform would expand the scope of the government in the way it processes and administers civil benefits, incentives, and protections by expanding the definitions of notions like cohabitation, custody, and estate in a way that is agnostic to the historically ideal nuclear family, and is more supportive of the non-traditional households that exist in our reality - and sympathetic to the needs of third parties like children and elderly relatives whose support networks are lost when the government doesn't know how to label mom and dad.  Keep in mind, for the majority of human history slavery was also an embedded feature of our society. We have prehistoric religious thought to thank for that little social norm, too."

I was laughing uncontrollably at the comment that our civilization would literally grind to a halt and our government would cease to function because of some simple contracts.

Likewise, you won't be able to just assume that your spouse will be able to make things like hospital decisions for you etc.  It is absolutely an insane proposition that this nutjob is trying to foist on everyone just because he thinks that gay people are spoiling their little private club (aka ""traditional marriage"")."
SaltLakeCity,3bb81j,HatuutaH,4,Sun Jun 28 13:11:18 2015 UTC,"To say the bill won't pass is naive.  Allow me to explain my reasoning.  You have a bunch of fired up conservative legislators who have wanted to do something about the many court rulings on SSM effecting Utah.

Does society have a compelling interest to keep siblings or cousins from marrying one another and producing children?  Contractually, you have no reason to marry your brother or cousin as they already have a stake in your estate, whether you like it or not since they are legally recognized as family.  The only way you can exclude them is through specifically willing them out through a legal document (aka a last will and testament.)    Now, if were talking about illegal sex:  that's a different story."

SaltLakeCity,3bbnwt,JLym,5,Sat Jun 27 18:33:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tried going to meetups but I swear being a female there sucks since people don't seem to understand that while I have a partner who isn't social, it doesn't mean it isn't a good or committed relationship.  Then of course I just am not good at contributing to conversations about their families since I just don't relate to those.  Not that I have anything against people with kids, but it's a major part of their life that I just don't understand since it's not part of my plans.  And then of course the LDS things.  It just feels like there isn't a place where I can just meet people who just want to be friends and hang out without any pressures or judgments."

We have a different liquor license than Deer Valley and therefore cannot legally allow any outside liquor. The event does care if you bring in outside alcohol as we can lose our liquor license. No other drinks are allowed for the exact reason specified in the comments. Your alcohol will be confiscated and you will be asked to leave the premises. Our tickets to the Symphony are much less than the ones at Deer Valley because of our liquor restrictions. We hope you have a great time and understand why we need to enforce these laws. Thank you!"

Lucky for you the thief was most likely a tweeker and not a professional. Next time try to lock your frame and wheel to the post, or carry a loop of heavy cable. like this  You almost came out to just a front wheel this morning. Chalk it up as a learning experience, we all have to figure it out one way or another."
SaltLakeCity,3bbp93,I_Peed_on_my_Skis,2,Sat Jun 27 19:40:58 2015 UTC,"Yup, U-lock through the back wheel anywhere within the back triangle (over the triangle if you think someone's going to take the time to actually cut your wheel - unlikely) and a cable through the front wheel just to prevent an easy nab of the wheel. Make 'em work a little.  EDIT: diagram"
SaltLakeCity,3bbp93,brockobear,0,Sun Jun 28 00:17:46 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your response! The lock did go through the frame too, in picture number 3 you can see that (although it is hard). I usually lock the back tire and have the cable, locking it like the diagram. This time, I forgot the cable before at my place and I figured it would be safe (I did not plan on leaving it overnight, it kind of just happened). But again, thank you for the informative response and I'll definitely be locking it up properly now, even if I have to ride all the way back to my place for forgetting the cable."
SaltLakeCity,3bbp93,I_Peed_on_my_Skis,5,Sun Jun 28 02:24:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm, ok. It must be some kind of optical illusion, because in order for it to be truly locked through the frame, the black lock would be just above and to the right of where the '""I"" in FUJI is on your down tube.  In your photo it appears to be below the ""I"" near your derailer cable, which would in fact, only be locking your front wheel to the post.  Lock it up that way, and then release your front wheel from the fork. If you can remove your whole frame you'll see what I'm saying. If not then thats one hell of an optical illusion, I'm sure someone else here sees what I'm talking about.    I too only lock my front wheel and frame on my fixie, the rear has 8mm chain tensioners which make removing the rear wheel a bit more of a job, but it looks differently than that when properly locked.  I'm only so adamant about you being sure its secure, because you mentioned how you are still new to biking, as we all were at some point and had to learn. Id rather come off as a dick then not insist you check for sure, otherwise the next thread will be about the whole bike being stolen.  Once again I'm sorry if I'm totally wrong. Just trying make sure you're locking your baby up securely, I love biking around the city, and its great to see more people doing it.  Bike thieves are the scum of the earth, I wouldn't want a bad experience to scare people away from biking."

I'm definitely going to keep that in mind when my bike is up and running again, I would love to have this never happen again. Thank you for the advice, it's greatly appreciated."
SaltLakeCity,3bbp93,deweysmith,2,Mon Jun 29 02:11:49 2015 UTC,"You had a wheel stolen, not a tire.   Wheels cost more then tires, but a quality wheel can be had for around a hundred bucks. You also need a cassette (gears), a tire (tread) and a tube. Plan on another hundred bucks if your buying this stuff new.  If your on a budget, head over to the bike collective  chances are they have a complete wheel for you for under a hundred bucks."

SaltLakeCity,3b7drx,DesolationRobot,2,Fri Jun 26 16:41:40 2015 UTC,"hahaha, my thoughts exactly. From ""Our Store's"" website:  Our Store's mission is to help the People With AIDS Coalition of Utah become self sustaining. Thus, allowing PWACU to improve and expand its programs to help People Living With HIV/AIDS. All proceeds directly benefit the PWACU. Vouchers for OUR STORE are given to people with HIV/AIDS.  From the PWACU site: The People With AIDS Coalition of Utah is funded by community contributions.  PWACU receives no Federal or State funding.  Donations of money or time are welcome. We support our own administrative expenses through the income from Our Store – Your Thrift Alternative. Therefore, 100% of the donations received go directly to our wonderful programs. PWACU is a 501 (c) 3 non-profit organization.  For people who don't know, the reason places like this exist is because HIV/AIDS drugs can cost at least $1000 a month to keep people alive. If you are making minimum wage you can see how it would be tough to pay for the drugs that keep you alive as well as rent, food, clothing etc. It's awesome to see a non-profit open a business to help support their costs. Looks like a great place if you have time/money/stuff to donate."

Doctrine and Covenants 134:4 - 4 We believe that religion is instituted of God; and that men are amenable to him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless their religious opinions prompt them to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others; but we do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private devotion; that the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but never control conscience; should punish guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul.

Everyone is so cookie cutter in Provo.  I mean, I'm a quasi-crossdresser and I stick out like a sore thumb.  In Salt Lake, there's much more diversity, which I think leads to more realization that it's all good.  To be fair, Provo is a nice place.  The people are nice to each other and stuff.  But if I were to raise kids here, I would have to frequently go out of my way to expose my kids to diverse crowds of people.  Regarding people in my ward here, everyone knows I'm a quasi-crossdresser and nobody cares.  I've had two different bishops explicitly say that it's okay.  So there might be some degree of the cookie cutter Peter Priesthood and Molly Mormon people giving everyone else a weird name."

SaltLakeCity,3b7dln,Kidballa,3,Fri Jun 26 15:49:49 2015 UTC,you will absolutely make $1000's more by selling it on KSL. I don't know why people trade their vehicles in. It's not hard to sell a car. It takes a few hours of your life and anyone on here does not make $1-2000 for a few hours of work.
SaltLakeCity,3b7dln,SenorKerry,6,Fri Jun 26 17:53:06 2015 UTC,"I just traded my 2014 WRX in for a few reasons.  First, I didn't want to deal with the hassle of selling a car that books in around 29K. It's a ton of money, and I didn't want to hear about the lowballs, and all the nitpicking to try and knock 500$ off here and there. I also didn't want to deal with the loan/title/etc. 100% hassle.   Second, I didn't want to deal with all the tire kickers who just wanted to drive around a WRX for a bit, with ultimately no intention of buying it.  Third, I didn't want to deal with not having a car for a period of time. My new car still isn't here, and will have taken ~3 weeks of time to actually get. I need a car to get to work, the gym, etc. I also needed the equity in my car, to buy my new car. So, having both at the same time, was not an option.  Last, and what touches on your reply entirely, I did get offered a few grand less than I would have privately. You are right about that. But, I also got a tax credit on the purchase of my new car, which ultimately made the deal sixes. If I had sold it for the 2K more I could have likely gotten, I'd have paid that 2K more in taxes on my new car. All, while not actually doing any more work than I'd have to have done just buying the new car.  With all that said, I do think if you're selling a car that books <10K, you should sell it privately. You'll deal with mostly cash offers, the tax credit is not nearly as great, and you'll get banged up at the dealership a lot more."
SaltLakeCity,3b7dln,rathulacht,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:02:47 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. You know I always buy my cars in cash so I hadn't thought about loans, tax credits, etc."
SaltLakeCity,3b7dln,SenorKerry,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:06:48 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, if people are wanting to buy a new(er) car from a dealer, trading it in lowers the over-all price of the new car--essentially bringing down the amount of tax you have to pay."
SaltLakeCity,3b7dln,rathulacht,2,Fri Jun 26 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"In theory, yes. But, you need to keep in mind that that doesn't necessarily mean it will be more profitable for you.  I'm going to use 100% fictional numbers here, just to make life easy for everyone.  You sell the car privately, and get 7000$. You buy new car for 20K out the door. You put the 7K into that. You now owe 13K for the car.   OR  You trade the car in for 5000$. You get a tax credit of 1000$ (which you won't. it'll be significantly lower). Now, the new car cost 19K OTD, you apply your 5000$, and you own 14K on the car.  So yes, it did effect the total with the tax credit. But, in the end, it wasn't actually a better deal for you.  With that said, there are a thousand variables that may make the trade in work for you, instead of selling privately. Just keep in mind, it's not a guarantee, and often not the case."

Larry H Miller used car supermarket, also in Sandy, gave me $8000 in trade. They also sort of ripped me off on the price of the car that I traded for, so it was probably a wash... I was in a hurry to get a 4WD vehicle and I didnt do as much research as I should have.  But yeah, Car Max gives you the offer and that's it. They won't negotiate at all.  I dont know if that helps at all, but those are some concrete numbers... I'd say just go to a couple dealers and let them look at your car and see what they offer you."

SaltLakeCity,3b3b4q,aa8y,8,Thu Jun 25 16:57:05 2015 UTC,"Part is personal preference (do you prefer moist or dry?) and some of it is the preference of items you own (do you have wooden instruments or expensive cameras?).  How sensitive are you to moisture in the air? Do yo have any equipment that is sensitive to moisture in the air?  Some people suffer from skin conditions that are affected by humidity, other people prefer different levels of humidity.  Personally I prefer the dry air as it makes sweat more effective and reduces the risk of certain skin infections. Fungal infections like ringworm will blossom in high humidity, dry air like we've got in SLC makes the infections much less common. But some people prefer higher humidity. One of my children, unfortunately, has chronically dry skin that starts to crack and bleed without daily moisturizers. Different people have different skin.  Many items in your home are similarly sensitive. As I've got a musical family, we have various instruments that benefit from extra humidity. Many wood instruments (we have guitars, a clarinet, violins, and piano that are sensitive) sound better at higher humidity as it affects the wood. Frequent and rapid changes in humidity can cause the wood to fissure and crack; wooden clarinets specifically get moist when played but can dry in between, and the change can be nasty to the wood. Humidity affects tone of many instruments; acoustic guitars sound better when the wood is more saturated by humidity, there are water chambers to humidify guitars in storage to prevent the wood from splitting.  For these, humidity is good.  Some equipment, such as camera lenses, have the opposite humidity concerns.  Lens fungus causes permanent fatal damage, and usually once the fugus has spread the photographers must replace all contaminated equipment, including exposed camera bags and exposed camera bodies. In humid areas photographers often buy dehumidifying cabinets to store their equipment in. Here in SLC I can just open my camera bag up when at home if it was exposed to moisture, with virtually no worries about lens fungus.  For these, humidity is bad.  So really it depends on more information about your personal preferences and what items you are concerned about."
SaltLakeCity,3b3b4q,rabid_briefcase,2,Thu Jun 25 17:33:11 2015 UTC,"That's really sound advice. I did not know humidity helps musical instruments. The one I have is not too expensive.

If, on the other hand, your humidifier is not adjacent to your electronics, you'll never get your humidity in your house/apartment/room above what is normal in many parts of the world where electronics function normally.  In other words, people in Houston have computers, phones, xboxes, etc., even though relative humidity regularly pushes past 80-90%.

The humidifier is on the plenum   If you don't mind, can you explain this in more easier terms? What I understood (by looking up plenum) is that you have the humidifier in the area which contains the air to be blown out of ducts.

Its quite a site.. and while the popularity of the spot has been growing in recent years, its usually still not as crowded as going to one of the major city fireworks displays.."

You don't have to talk to anyone, just sit and people watch and be around people. You'll get more comfortable with people just by doing this and observing how other people talk to each other.   For me, a BIG thing that helped my social anxiety/self-confidence is therapy. There are some affordable therapists out there that can really help you.  The main thing to remember, though, is to just do activities that you genuinely enjoy. Ideally, they'll be activities that can/will involve other people, but this isn't always the case, and that's ok. Remember, you want to be around people who you can be yourself around; conforming to what you think other people would like is generally a bad idea.   Hope this helps.

A lot of rape cases are he said she said and unless the victim has a slam dunk case, they choose to not pursue charges because it would mean having their entire life scrutinized in front of a jury."

Any chance you could answer some questions you just raised for me?   how do the winters compare. What should I know about the alcohol laws out there/how do they differ?
SaltLakeCity,3az150,JP50515,4,Wed Jun 24 17:50:58 2015 UTC,"There is no comparison. Winters here are hell. The temperature in SLC rarely gets down into the teens. Even at night, I think the lows are in the 20s. When it snows in SLC, the temp will be below freezing, but then tends to warm back up and the snow melts all off. The one thing about the winters in Utah that sucks is the inversions. Something happens that traps a lot of dirty air in the valley and everything just is gross until another storm comes in and cleans everything out. But you can always go up into the mountains to get out of it from time to time, work and schedule permitting. I didn't drink much when I was in Utah, but there are some weird laws that I can think of off the top of my head: For one, only one drink in front of you at a time. So no shots alongside your beer or whatever. And no happy hours. Alcohol has to be bought with food at restaurants. Even if its just like a dollar for snacks or something. If you have ever been to the Tin Fish in uptown, kind of like that. Alcohol is also meticulously measured out, so no generous portions of drinks. And I don't think you can get doubles of whatever. 3.2 Beer and wine coolers are sold in grocery stores, so anything else you want stronger are sold in liquor stores. If you go to a Utah Jazz game, they only serve beer. However, if you manage to get into a suite, you can actually buy a bottle of liquor for the same price as you would buy it at a liquor store. In new restaurants, I think a law passed where all booze is prepared in the kitchen area now or something. Or at least behind some sort of wall. Other people will have to chime in on this, tho."

SaltLakeCity,3az150,dmarie229,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:08:07 2015 UTC,"A couple of minor corrections:   You can have a beer and a shot at the same time, but not a beer and a wine or a shot and a mixed drink.   Beer only in grocery stores, no wine coolers.   As for the wall that drinks are prepared behind, it applies to restaurants but not bars and is generally called the "" Zion Curtain"""

SaltLakeCity,3az150,shatterly,2,Wed Jun 24 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"The winters here are milder compared to MN.  We get the lake effect but not to the same degree as y'all with the Great Lakes and millions of tinier lakes.  Another benefit, less mosquitos so you can actually enjoy the outdoors in the spring/summer/fall.  I don't know the liquor laws for MN but here it is: beer only at grocery stores and gas stations; liquor and higher point beer at state owned liquor stores (which are closed sundays and most holidays); no kegs sold, you can brew your own beer though and there's a pretty good microbrew market here as well as tons of local breweries; in bars/clubs, no free-pouring, there's a strict 1.5oz limit to mixed drinks (I think it's 1.5?)"

There are endless things to see and do that are extraordinary because of the beautiful and diverse landscape. I love the Midwest for sure (it's where I grew up), but I don't hesitate to recommend Utah to virtually anyone who is looking for a place to be or a new lease on life. Well, Salt Lake City in particular. As long as you live in the city proper, you'll find that the church isn't a looming specter or anything. Seems like there is a thriving beer culture around here, plenty of craft breweries. Plus there are a lot of great festivals and shows that come through that are really fun and affordable. I've seen several of my favorite musicians perform here in the past year, often with $5-$20 tickets. I have a ""bucket list"" of stuff to do before I go that is a mile long, and that's after more than a year of jam-packed weekends and living to the fullest.   In sum, I think SLC is a great place to be a single young professional: good job market, lots of options for meeting people, relaxing, and adventuring. If you're seriously considering it, I doubt you'd regret it."

He read the article and sent them a few factual corrections and they actually removed a photo of the power plant and deleted content about a tester the midwife was using incorrectly.   But for the rest of it...it's sad and true. It's not limited to the Great Basin but incidents are similar wherever they're tracking. Most of the rigs in ND aren't sitting 400 feet from houses though, and I think that's the shocking part about Vernal. That and the fact that the people so vehemently support an industry that has done more economic harm than good (they've had more bust years than boom years since drilling started decades ago), and that the industry is putting people's health on the line. We lived in gold mining communities before he transferred to vernal and at least in those towns, everyone was making money consistently (and good money at that, unlike vernal), and the mining companies invested tons into the community (vernal not even close)  When i got pregnant, I moved back to SLC and he commutes home on the weekends. It sucks but it's just not worth the health risk, not to mention the community at large isn't socially what I prefer to raise my kid around."

If your against fracking (like I am), this article should especially offend you because it makes you look dumber standing next to these guys.  Ok fracking is bad (probably), we get it, but the money involved is pushing it forward. The oil companies are trying to keep us confused about the risks, and generous campaign contributions to a certain right leaning party keep any regulations mired. If it were an article on that, I'd be on board, but it's not.  A few points, a midwife is not a doctor, and in this case I don't think she even has a college degree in a related field. So take her saying there sure seems to be alot of baby deaths with a grain of salt, this is not an expert in medical statistics. Could she be right, certainly, but just taking her word on it is a fairly poor idea.  Next this article is so full of stupid statistics it burns, I work with these kind of things for a living, and this article makes me want to punch puppies. Take this gem right here:   The worst such period in the Basin's recent history was the winter of 2012-13, when nearly all the Uintah mothers whose babies died were pregnant.   Not only is this a crime against English, because it took me two or three readings to get past all of the weasel words, its shows zero understanding of the underlying statistics. This should be the case every year because 20% of known pregnancies miscarry. If it were not the case it would require that more than 1 in 5 babies die within their first year.   Does that sound high, if so it's because it's astronomically high, like medieval midwifery high. The real statistic is the US losses just under 7 babies for every 1,000 live births (and that is an embarrassment for being so high), meaning this is quite a bit more than an order of magnitude off. For this not to be the case for all years, Vernal would have to have an infant mortality rate 29 times the national average.  At that point we wouldn't be having this conversation, because if the numbers were that clear we would be talking about that instead. That's far from the only failing this article has, and goes to show that the rolling stones is about as reliable as fox news talking about Obama's birth certificate. I don't even understand who there demo is anymore, because people who prefer dead tree are too old to be interested in their particular brand of journalism, and those that might like their style want to consume their content digitally."

This part is pretty shocking:   [Donna Young's] numbers show an upward four-year trend in infant deaths: One in every 95.5 burials in Uintah County in 2010 was a baby, according to Young. In 2011 it was one in every 53. In 2012, one in every 39.7. And in 2013 the number jumped to one in every 15."

SaltLakeCity,3aubtn,DeadSeaGulls,14,Wed Jun 24 22:11:17 2015 UTC,"(I don't live in Vernal. Fracking is an issue nationwide, not just for one small town in Utah. I'm not an expert on fracking.)  Fracking's main impacts on the air are 1) direct transmission of various solvents and other hazardous compounds into the air at evaporation drilling sites and evaporation ponds and 2) its dependency on vast amounts of trucking to transport the wastewater that's integral to the process.  Halliburton's secret solvent pollutes drinking water by 1) dispersing when it's pumped into the ground and making its way into aquifers, wells, and underground streams.  The 80% that stays in the ground doesn't just magically disappear underground. 2) Spills from pipelines and transportation accidents and 3) spillage from evaporation ponds.  To your point about sensationalism:  1) it's rolling stone, and they're trying to sell their content.  It's a false dichotomy to claim that because it's a sensational story it's not true because...  2) fracking is doing some pretty sensational things to the environment.  It's creating earthquakes.  It's polluting air and water.  It's using colossal amounts of water.  And all of this might be killing unborn babies.  The point of the article is that it's becoming increasingly clear that fracking is putting a multitude of its byproducts into the environment, and many of those byproducts have been proven to be carcinogens or otherwise hazardous to your health, yet any plan to mitigate the pollution will inevitably mean less fracking, less money from fracking, or both.    People will predictably fall into two camps on this issue: those who think putting up with the pollution is worth the money, and those who don't.  If you've delivered a stillborn baby and there's even a small chance that less pollution would have led to a live birth, it's obvious which side you're on.  On the other hand, if you don't know anyone who went through that, and you've got a nice new house with a good-paying job, and a bunch of new businesses to spend your new money on, then you can let someone else suffer the side effects from fracking and pretend they're desperate to scapegoat the industry because of their grief."

Property taxes are levied at the state and local level, based on assessed valuations established by elected county assessors and, in the case of certain properties, by the State Tax Commission's Property Tax Division. Salt Lake City property owners may submit an appeal of assessments against their property to the Salt Lake County Board of Equalization, within the time period permitted by law."
SaltLakeCity,3avrle,ajfa,2,Tue Jun 23 23:01:13 2015 UTC,"Generally, property taxes are very low in SLC.   To give you an idea: I used to live in Austin, TX. Property taxes were almost triple what I pay in SLC. Also, medical insurance was much, much more expensive in TX. So despite TX having no state income tax, it was more expensive to live in than Utah."
SaltLakeCity,3avrle,HatuutaH,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:21:56 2015 UTC,"Also the income tax rate varies from 2.3% to 7%, but most Utahans fall into the 5% bracket."

SaltLakeCity,3avrle,varthalon,2,Wed Jun 24 19:26:08 2015 UTC,"Utah Income Tax - Utah has a single 5% income tax rate. However they also give a tax credit based on how high your income is, your exemptions, and your standard or itemized deduction. In effect it means Utah's real income tax rate is anywhere between 0% to 5% depending on your situation. All income tax goes to public education.  Utah Sales Taxes - Each county and city can impose it's own sales taxes within the guidelines established by the state. Depending on where you are making a purchase the tax rate ranges between 5.7% to 10%. Purchases at restaurants, hotels, and car rentals are subject to a tourism tax which can add an additional 1-5% and an additional tax of up to 6% on electricity and gas sold for home use. Sales taxes are generally used to operate the state and local governments, but some portions are reserved for specific services such as for public parks, public buses, subsidizing rural medical centers, etc.  Utah Property Taxes - Each county and city can impose it's own property taxes within the guidelines established by the state. I'm not sure on the range of tax rates but it is fairly low when compared to most other states. Property taxes are split between local schools and the operation budgets of local governments and special service districts (like water districts). Utah does not impose property taxes on personal vehicles, instead it charges an annual registration fee that is $55 per year for most people (up to $110 for electric/natural gas vehicles).  Utah Fuel Taxes - Utah currently has a fuel tax of 24.5 cents per gallon but just passed a law that will raise it to 29.4 cents per gallon on January 1st.  There is a much lower fuel tax rate for clean fuels like Natural Gas and Hydrogen. Fuel taxes are used to build and maintain transportation infrastructure.  Utah Other Taxes - Utah has about 40 other minor taxes but I don't know what may apply to you. You can see them all at http://tax.utah.gov/utah-taxes. Let me know if you want more details on any of them."

SaltLakeCity,3aw084,Sheslion,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:47:04 2015 UTC,"America First is the largest credit union in the area. I think they stretch as far as California. They are everywhere. It's nice that they are a CU as opposed to a bank, and it's nice that they are actually quite large, so they may be able to offer things that other smaller establishments don't. My other top pick is Mountain America CU, who treated me very well for a long time. I often wish I'd never closed that account. In either case you'll get good customer service, and they are both in the credit union ATM network, so you'll get access to your fund fee-free at any CU ATM. The only issue I've had is that some credit unions do not have 24 hr customer service like larger banks."

SaltLakeCity,3atjl2,houseJr,2,Tue Jun 23 15:33:55 2015 UTC,Thanks - I just moved back and heard they changed the dog off leash areas. I googled this morning trying to find out how far of a walk from the parking lot it is but turned up empty. Have you been recently?
SaltLakeCity,3atjl2,survivalmode,2,Tue Jun 23 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"They have changed a few of the areas, not necessarily for the better.  It's still one of the better dog parks in the valley, though. It's less than a mile from the parking lot to the best swimming spot (top of the creek where it pools just after passing under I-215)."
SaltLakeCity,3auz0t,Insanity_-_Wolf,6,Tue Jun 23 18:44:48 2015 UTC,"Your question is far too vague.  What is your definition of living well?   Eating steak a few nights a week? Eating something other than ramen a few nights a week?   ""Reducing my commute to the U"" has no context either - are you trying to move within 5 minutes of campus? 5 minutes of a Red Line stop? Anywhere that isn't as far away as Daybreak?  If you put in just a tiny bit more effort you might get helpful responses. Go take a look at /r/personalfinance and maybe /r/Frugal, set up a budget and figure out what you can afford."
SaltLakeCity,3auz0t,YupYesYeah,-7,Tue Jun 23 19:15:14 2015 UTC,I'm asking based on other people's definition of living well.
SaltLakeCity,3auz0t,YupYesYeah,5,Tue Jun 23 19:26:27 2015 UTC,"Which again, is incredibly vague. There's a lot of factors here that you're trying to simplify way too much.  My definition 5 years ago would be being able to afford my rent and car, eat something marginally better than ramen and have enough to go to a concert/bar once or twice a week with my friends. Living well meant living in a not so terrible situation, in the moment.  My definition of living well today is having enough to pay my mortgage ahead of schedule, max my 401k, invest a bit on top of that and still be able to go out with friends without worrying about how I'm going to pay for something. Living well now means being able to afford things without debt and preparing for the future."
SaltLakeCity,3auz0t,fake_somebody,-2,Tue Jun 23 20:46:57 2015 UTC,"I just need to figure out how much I need to earn this summer in order to cover costs of living while studying without working. So far I've saved up 8k from my business over the last 2 months. My idea of well is living in a reasonably nice apartment and covering living expenses(utilities, groceries, gas, insurance). I usually cook, I don't remember the last time I went out to eat. As far as entertainment goes I can usually find the money if I need it."
SaltLakeCity,3auz0t,halioscar,2,Tue Jun 23 20:54:02 2015 UTC,So is the plan just to live off of 8k for just the summer?
SaltLakeCity,3auz0t,halioscar,3,Wed Jun 24 00:39:22 2015 UTC,"I paid my own way through school, including rent (old apartment building at ~700 E, 300 S), utilities, internet, car payment, insurance, food, etc. During the slower months at the restaurant I was working at, I would pull in about $1000 a month, which felt pretty tight. I would say $1500+/month would be considered comfy living for a college student, including wiggle room for a night life and miscellaneous expenses. That being said, I was without a car for a couple of years, which is totally doable if you're close enough to the downtown area. That could save you a good chunk of change if you don't mind taking public transportation or calling a Lyft when you're in a jam. Hope this helps!"
SaltLakeCity,3auz0t,Grumbleduke7749,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:59:56 2015 UTC,"You see that's what I'm trying to figure out. It may be worth it to pay higher rent closer to the U and instead of paying for gas and car insurance, take advantage of the free public transport."
SaltLakeCity,3auz0t,ajfa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:05:08 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of an adjustment, but after a few months you'll find that it's easy enough to get around without one. Especially with that swanky transit pass that you get as a U student. It's not for everyone, but I got by just fine."

SaltLakeCity,3apkz0,Tyroar,3,Tue Jun 23 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know how many dog parks we have in SL county? And off leash ones at that, compared to say, normal parks? People complaining about the dogs should realize that if there is a devoted space for them to go, you wouldn't see so many in the other spaces. Once that space is established, don't go there, and you may start being able to avoid the rabid dog charging incident you've described a few times. Everyone has the same rights to public space, so to say 'I don't like dogs being off leash around me, but I don't support giving them an area to be off leash away from me in,' is basically saying, 'I don't like them around me, or anywhere else for that matter.'   Also, what about residents who don't have the privilege of having a fenced in yard? Their dogs are pretty much destined to be on a rope anytime they are outside for the duration of their lives. Seems a bit cruel and unnecessary."

Chances are, if we have off leash parks, majority of people going to them won't be scared of dogs, and it could even lessen the amount of dogs in other public recreational areas."
SaltLakeCity,3apkz0,Tyroar,0,Tue Jun 23 14:11:51 2015 UTC,Maybe they shouldn't covert her neighborhood park into a dog park.
SaltLakeCity,3apkz0,Michael_MDF,0,Tue Jun 23 16:33:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm sure she isn't the only one in her neighborhood, so its not really 'her' park. I'm not saying the best fix is converting existing parks to off leash dog parks, but there need to be alternatives. All you are saying is I don't like dogs in MY parks, I don't care who else's public space it is, or what they might want. This is stated to be a pilot program so we can research and expand possibilities for all our citizens, to keep everyone happy."
SaltLakeCity,3apkz0,Michael_MDF,2,Tue Jun 23 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"And that's fair enough.  Why do people who have dogs hate the segregated, fenced, off-leash dog parks so much?  You know, like the one by Liberty Park?  Why can't sections of parks be fenced off to be off-leash parks and others don't have to be concerned about some strange dog going after them?  Every park could have such areas.  Every park.  Outside the fenced area?  Get your dog on a leash like it should be when it is out in public."
SaltLakeCity,3apkz0,IgnacioLopes,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"That's perfectly fair. I personally only know of 2 dog parks, and they are pretty far away. But I have probably 10 parks within 10 blocks of me. So I totally agree with maybe having designated areas in whatever park solely for off leash dogs. Great idea!"

SaltLakeCity,3apkz0,windowlesspanelvan,3,Mon Jun 22 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most dogs at dog parks don't care about other humans. They know what people smell like, they want to smell and explore everything else and chase each other.  I totally understand a 'fear' of dogs, I had that for years after being mauled by a damn Rottweiler when I was young, but now that I am an owner of a Black Lab and interact with dogs more, I have no fear of them.  The thing about 'public places' is that it's public, so any change or suggestion of a change is going to upset some group of people, that's just how things work."
SaltLakeCity,3apkz0,gizamo,-1,Mon Jun 22 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, but dog owners need to learn to stop saying ""don't worry, he's nice"" or ""don't worry, he's never bitten any body"" when their dog does charge at a person.  It doesn't do anything to alleviate the fear or anger of the person who is being charged.  Get the dog under control and say you're sorry.  That's all it takes.  And, by the way.  I really like dogs.  I had 6 all at once when I was a kid."

We sent him a check the next day for the full amount of his donation, along with a kindly worded note saying donations don't buy votes. (Although even if they did, a few hundred dollars wouldn't!)  I don't exactly blame Love for accepting this donation. There's nothing in the name of the organization that indicates it's a white supremacist group.

SaltLakeCity,3argb8,WasabiBomb,2,Mon Jun 22 22:24:26 2015 UTC,"You can't swim in any of the Cottonwood Canyons lakes, and the others in the Wasatch don't appeal to me personally for swimming, except for maybe Silver Lake and Pittsburgh Lake up American Fork Canyon.  I don't like swimming in the reservoirs, generally.  YMMV.  If I needed to cool down, I'd head to the Uintas, and swim in literally any of the lakes there.  I'd probably not go to one that's right next to a road and instead opt for one like, say...Cliff Lake.  If I had time to go farther, I'd go to Causey Reservoir for cliff jumping, or up to Bloomington Lake just over the Idaho border near Bear Lake, for the rope swing."

SaltLakeCity,3aq7rw,fishbone937,2,Mon Jun 22 23:13:52 2015 UTC,Here's the deal people. No prices are ever set in stone. We live in a free market so as long as you are not in a contract you are a free agent. When my 12 month deal with Century Link ended they jacked my rates to like $79 a month for the same service. I called and politely told them I enjoyed their product and never had a problem with it but I would not be paying google fiber prices for DSL. They quickly looked up a new deal for me and locked me in. Now I have DSL for another 12 months.

SaltLakeCity,3and7c,peterwestinghouse,4,Sun Jun 21 22:35:36 2015 UTC,"So we recently hired a guy to do some front end web development for us who went through DevPoint. If I remember correctly he said it was a good experience to get him started but wished it was more in depth and longer. My thoughts would be that its going to mainly start you off on the learning the basics and to build a solid coding structure and its up to you to continue your education being by yourself or with another school.   Edit: This is what I just heard from our employee I didn't attend one of these camps, I am self taught."
SaltLakeCity,3and7c,fake_somebody,2,Sun Jun 21 23:03:14 2015 UTC,"As you're self-taught, do you think my worry about learning to code the ""wrong way"" is a legit worry? I'm worried that if I use the wrong website course, or pick up the wrong book, it might hinder my progress.   I liken it to me learning to play tennis. My brother and I thought it would be fun to play tennis, so we bought some crappy racquets and went and played at the neighborhood tennis court all summer. We got pretty good and decided to tryout for our high school team when school started up. And although we were probably as good as the others we didn't make the team because we didn't know the fundamentals, didn't know all the rules, and didn't have a solid foundation of tennis.  Whenever I think about teaching myself to code, my tennis experience causes me hesitation."

SaltLakeCity,3and7c,MyKungFuIsGood,4,Wed Jun 24 13:14:15 2015 UTC,"So I haven't been to either but I work as a front end developer and had an interest in these because my sister was curious about getting into the industry. I've bumped into 6 or so devmountain graduates, been to a devmountain open house and chatted with a recruiter on his opinion and experiences placing devmountain grads.  The recruiter told me it was a mixed bag and what made a successful devmountain graduate were the side projects they had completed outside of the bootcamp.  The graduates I've met from devmountain seem to have a good grasp of fundamentals and be aware of the important things in javascript like prototypical inheritance and closures. I don't know if they were at the point that they could apply that knowledge fully but that probably is due to them being new to programming. They also didn't know css very well which I found a bit surprising for people claiming to be in front end development. However, css is incredibly easy to learn compared to javascript's concepts.  The open house was ok, I left with mixed feelings. One of the speakers seemed ill prepared and the other was a great public speaker and seemed to know their stuff. I liked how they stressed mentors were available to answer your questions but they try to push you to find your answers through googling first. That's such an important skill to cultivate in our industry.  In conclusion I advised my sister that it was probably a good investment. I would expect to come out as a green junior level developer. I think your best options for placement out of the gate would be at marketing or agency type firms that pump out websites and don't need to worry about large code bases and technical debt.  Hope this helps you make a decision."

Now, DevMountain's demo day is actually Friday and I'll be going, if you'd like to go with someone. Just PM me."
SaltLakeCity,3and7c,GrandMasterSpock,2,Mon Jun 22 09:08:46 2015 UTC,"I have no experience with DevMountain, but I recently graduated from DevPoint labs and it was definitely worth it.  It's not like a typical school, there are no grades or attendance policies and the only quiz isn't graded.   The great thing about DevPoint labs is that you get out of it what you put into it. You can't expect to go in and have them give you the answers, because nobody learns like that. Instead the instructor is like Mr. Miyagi because he will guide you through the process of being able to figure out a problem on your own, which is the most valuable trait you can have as a human being.   The current idea is that you can't teach someone to be able to solve a problem, or be self sufficient. DevPoint shatters that notion like a windshield in a car crash. They give you proper guidance to figure out how to learn things you don't know and how to solve a problem that you haven't been through yet.  The best part is that if you need help, there is a whole staff of TA's to ask and every once in a while a really experienced developer will come in and mentor you if your interested.  If you want someone to give you all the answers then programming is not for you.  If you want to learn how to do good research, train your mind, and grow as a person, all with proper guidance along the way, definitely enroll Dev Point Labs.  The reason I think it's so great is because I was actually coding in python for a year before I went to DevPoint. With no experience in ruby before hand, 2 weeks in to the program I was a far better at programming in ruby than in python. So they have figured out how to teach, if you're willing to learn :)  Also, the staff is a lot of fun and really friendly, so you may just want to hang out there because its a happy place.   Hope this helps :)   Any questions for a recent graduate? haha"

SaltLakeCity,3akm7a,A_mellifera,2,Sun Jun 21 04:54:17 2015 UTC,People spearfish in Utah?
SaltLakeCity,3akm7a,rathulacht,2,Sun Jun 21 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"Yep. It's actually a fantastic state for spearfishing. You are allowed to spear a lot of different types of fish (even some trout), and you don't even have to dive very deep because the fish stay above the thermocline. Starvation is a popular lake, but they held the Spearfishing Nationals at Powell a few years ago. I think Fish Lake has also hosted it in the past. Deer Creek Reservoir is a great place too.   Just found this post showing a tournament at Starvation last year. http://rockymountainspearfishing.org/wp/?p=424  Just have to be careful, because bait fisherman get really curious (and therefore close) when they see the spear come out."

If you can stay on trax / frontrunner (and to a lesser extent the Sugarhouse streetcar) it's accessible &amp; convenient. The buses are a lot more rare and the routes don't have the best coverage. Check rideuta.com  Lyft &amp; uber both operate here, and I suggest them over local cabs. They do not operate at the airport, but you can get trax out of the airport and get an uber from a stop."
SaltLakeCity,3am8nm,ryumast3r,2,Sun Jun 21 16:46:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! Totally forgot about Uber and Lyft. I'll look into that. Trax and frontrunner are the train systems right?
SaltLakeCity,3am8nm,pergn0ntits,2,Sun Jun 21 17:10:14 2015 UTC,FrontRunner is the commuter rail system between Ogden (awesome) and Provo (shithole). Salt Lake City (also awesome) is in the middle.  The light rail system (Trax) is a decent local option for SLC and nearby suburbs. Check out the system maps on rideuta.com. Google maps has the UTA schedules and can help you plan your trips.

I know slc is the most liberal place, but he was sort of the balance. Like he had won over republicans somehow. I'm liberal but I liked how he seems not just liberal but good"
SaltLakeCity,3ajyv0,Hari___Seldon,9,Sat Jun 20 23:38:33 2015 UTC,SLC hasn't had a Republican mayor since 1974. A democrat winning the mayoral race in SLC is nothing noteworthy.
SaltLakeCity,3ajyv0,Hari___Seldon,16,Sun Jun 21 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"Yes absolutely. While he is perhaps a bit more off center than the Salt Lake population as a whole, I think that worked in the city's favor far more than a more moderate mayor's approaches would have. When he left office, one of the comments I often heard was that the city needed a technocrat rather than a trailblazer as mayor. Salt Lake got that, and the difference is notable. Given the steady progression to the left that both the city and the state have taken since then, I think Rocky would definitely be a strong choice."
SaltLakeCity,3ajyv0,Hari___Seldon,3,Sun Jun 21 00:57:10 2015 UTC,What were some of the things that Rocky blazed the trails in?
SaltLakeCity,3ajyv0,earthsick,11,Sun Jun 21 00:58:53 2015 UTC,"He was aggressive at calling to task many of the ridiculous political decisions being made at the state level, especially in relationship to how they affected Salt Lake. He was an excellent leader when it came to developing the city's cultural experience.   He has a long history of focusing on making education available to everyone, and broad support of economic development across the board. He was one of the first politicians in the state who actively acknowledged and defended the LGBT community.   He has been a regular proponent of sensible sentencing in criminal court, and is undeterred by political manipulation being pushed by special interests.   As I remember, he was also one of the first office holders in the state to aggressively address climate change not just at the policy level, but with actual action. Those are the things I remember off the top of my head."
SaltLakeCity,3ajyv0,o0MetalHead0o,8,Sun Jun 21 01:33:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, and if memory serves, he was a huge advocate for light rail, which I think is one of the most important steps forward that the city and county have taken to build a responsibly designed community."
SaltLakeCity,3ajyv0,Jameseatscheese,11,Sun Jun 21 01:43:44 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, without question! He is a huge advocate for public transit and actually uses it so he knows what works and what doesnt, supports the LGBTQ community, has TONS of accolades for environmental protection, and is by far the most progressive mayor SLC has ever had. Id love to have him back in office here."
SaltLakeCity,3ajyv0,Jameseatscheese,4,Sun Jun 21 04:53:42 2015 UTC,yep. I would vote for him for president in 1 second.
SaltLakeCity,3ajyv0,Jameseatscheese,3,Sun Jun 21 05:38:27 2015 UTC,He went a little batty when he was running for president. I'm not sure he'd maked it through the primary at this point.

SaltLakeCity,3ajyv0,TheBadWolf,2,Sun Jun 21 04:04:03 2015 UTC,"That's not true, Perot was treated very seriously in the 1992 election and eventually received 19% of the nationwide vote.  He even beat out the eventual winner Bill Clinton in Utah, with 27% of the vote (vs. 24%)."

As far as getting more votes than Clinton in Utah -- a stuffed bear in a wedding dress would get more votes than the democratic candidate in Utah even today (as long as there were an R after her name), so convincing our idiot electorate that you're not an idiot isn't a good indicatiin of the legitimacy of Perot's candidacy."

I'm not saying the mayor should just lay back and take whatever the state throws out, but they shouldn't intentionally antagonize a body that has full supremacy.  Among other reasons."
SaltLakeCity,3ajyv0,Hari___Seldon,3,Sun Jun 21 14:50:03 2015 UTC,How did Rocky antagonize the state?
SaltLakeCity,3ajyv0,SLCer,5,Sun Jun 21 01:53:56 2015 UTC,"Same way he has antagonized everyone else; by being loud and obnoxious. By protesting a president supported by the super majority of our legislature. You may not remember it, but near the end of his time at the city the state was threatening to preempt nearly every major ordinance he supported. The only way Becker was able to get the LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance passed without the state striking it down was by hiring a stereotypical pretty boy Mormon, Ben McAdams, to lobby on his behalf. It's only because of Ben and Ralph that the city and state are finally working together again.  Also I should have mentioned how disastrous he was at City Hall. Look through some of the Trib archives and you'll find almost ten stories of mayoral staffers quitting or being fired during his tenure. It was well known he was sleeping with a number of his staff, too, and several of the women who quit ended up pursuing legal compensation because of the hostile work environment. Talk to nearly any former staffer of his and they'll be the first to say Rocky shouldn't be allowed anywhere near City Hall again."

Of course there's the five national parks, the Great Salt Lake, the Bonneville Salt Flats, the Wasatch Mountains, the Uinta Mountains, the Manti La Sal National Forest, the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest, the mysterious Dugway Proving Grounds (one does not simply walk in there).   Cities? Logan, Brigham City, Ogden, Salt Lake City, Provo, Nephi, Fillmore, Beaver, Cedar City, St. George, Tooele, Park City, Vernal, Delta, Moab...  Other landmarks, get the Spiral Jetty on there, Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, um....

SaltLakeCity,3afgev,haolecoder,16,Sun Jun 21 06:43:59 2015 UTC,"These are amazing! If you sell prints of your work I would love to buy one when you finish!  There have already been some awesome ideas thrown out. As people have said, the National Parks are a must.   Arches NP -- Delicate Arch for sure, it's probably Utah's most iconic feature.   Canyonlands -- In terms of map features, this is where the Green River and the Colorado River meet.   Zion NP -- Two of the most famous hikes there are Angel's Landing and The Narrows/The Subway, which may go along with the fantasy theme quite well.   Bryce Canyon NP -- the main rock feature is the hoodoos, which look awesome and totally fit the fantasy theme.   Capitol Reef -- known for Cathedral Valley, among other regions.   Bonneville Salt Flats -- completely flat and barren stretch of bright white salt on the ground, best known as the home of Speed Week.  Great Salt Lake -- a giant super salty lake. Antelope Island is the largest island in the lake, which is home to a big herd of bison.   Bear Lake -- known for it's incredibly bright turquoise water.  Dinosaur National Monument -- houses a large dinosaur quarry in Vernal, UT.  Monument Valley -- scenic part of the Navajo reservation on the Utah/Arizona boarder with awesome rock formations.   Lake Powell   Mountain Ranges -- Wasatch Mountains (Mount Timponogos is particularly iconic in the region), Uinta Mountains (King's Peak in the Uintas is the highest peak in the state), Oquirrh Mountains, La Sal Mountains... and tons of smaller ones I can't think of right now.  As a detail that is somewhat unique in Utah, universities and towns put giant letters on the side of mountains and it's a big thing here in Utah. If it fits, it might be an awesome detail to have on the side of the mountains! Probably the most well known are Block U at the University of Utah and Y Mountain at BYU.   Locations/Cities -- Logan, Ogden, Salt Lake City, Vernal, Provo, Price, Moab, Bluff, Hurricane, St George, Cedar City, Beaver, Fillmore, Garden City, Boulder, Escalante, Bryce, Springdale  Other features -- Timponogos Caves, Temple Square in SLC, probably others too...   Awesome work!!"
SaltLakeCity,3afgev,lady_beer_farts,5,Fri Jun 19 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"I will second the desire for a print. I'd definitely pay for one. These are great. Though make it big. Like 4' tall big.  A couple to add:   Arches - also Landscape Arch. It's not as famous as delicate, but it's more impressive (at least to me) just because of its scale. Maybe also Morning Glory and Corona Arch, but those might be a bit much. In the Uintas, definitely mark Mirror Lake Highway as a road through them. A personal favorite of mine, Maple Canyon. Best and most unique climbing in the state. Golden spike Spiral Jetty   Olympic venues would also be cool, as kind of a historical item."
SaltLakeCity,3afgev,puhnitor,7,Sat Jun 20 03:49:26 2015 UTC,"I would say Park city with the film festival, Arches NP, 4 corners,  Fillmore(use to be the capital), The University of Utah marked with a block U and BYU marked with the Yale Y, (maybe some of the other universities), Bear lake, The golden spike, the Mortin salt company's logo pouring salt into the great salt lake, Lagoon, St. George, The green river.  This is what i can think of hope it helps."

SaltLakeCity,3afgev,jshultz,5,Thu Jun 25 03:59:06 2015 UTC,"Having moved to Utah from Montana, I would say:  The transportation routes of I-15, I-215 and I-80 dominate the state.  Note that the majority of the population sits in a North/South corridor along I-15.  I would also consider Point of the Mountain that separates the Salt Lake Metroplex from the Provo Metroplex.  It seems to be a big divider like the tunnel between Oakland and Walnut Creek.  Ski resorts (like 15 of them) are big for tourism around here, as is the world headquarters for a religion.  Another unique feature is the inversions that occur here.  Basically the smog gets trapped between two mountain ranges between which the Salt Lake Metroplex sits.  The south should be very bright rust reds and the north should be snowcapped blues and dark greens.  The south has an intense rust reds and oranges that differs from regular dirt colors.  I often think of it as striped.  Hope that helps! (edit: spelling)"
SaltLakeCity,3afgev,Desmodromic1078,3,Fri Jun 19 22:37:07 2015 UTC,One piece of context: 80% of Utah lives along the Wasatch Front. More if you continue down the I-15 to St. George.

It looks like most of your others have been relatively small - around 8 1/2 x 11 at the biggest. I'd bet you'd see a much larger interest at something closer to typical poster size - 24 x 36.

SaltLakeCity,3afgev,cbnass,3,Sat Jun 20 15:36:20 2015 UTC,"I offer up to 16x20 for prints, but yes, the originals are just 8x10. The biggest issues with making the originals larger are the material costs and the medium itself. Large Arches paper is pricey and watercolor/ink aren't erasable (and there are hundreds of opportunities for mess ups). I'd also need new, larger brushes.  The way I paint and the nature of watercolor also makes larger ones tough. I do a few lighter color washes, wait, then throw down blocks of color layers, sometimes filling up half of the space.

It will be turned back over to the city and the county once the 99 year trust expires:   Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County jointly owned the old State Prison site in the 1950s, having acquired it from the State of Utah after the prison was moved to the Point of the Mountain. In 1957, the city and county deeded the property, in trust, to the Sugar House Park Authority until Dec. 31, 2055. So, the Park Authority is now about halfway through its 99-year obligation to own, maintain and operate Sugar House Park."

SaltLakeCity,3afjmo,djsleazyrock,3,Fri Jun 19 18:46:58 2015 UTC,I'm terrified of being on someone's property   Don't be. The vast majority of this state is BLM or Forest Service land which pretty much allows open camping everywhere for FREE.  Campgrounds cost an few pennies but provide outhouses / water.  If you decide to go open camping I suggest buying a small port-a-potty.  Just do a google search for BLM camping in Utah.

SaltLakeCity,3afjmo,bryanut,5,Fri Jun 19 19:54:33 2015 UTC,"This is why I love Federal / Public land, I have no idea why some people in Utah don't get this and want to be like Texas (no offense to Texans) with its private game preserves, private campgrounds and private off road vehicle parks.  I would go up the Unitas this time of year (it is damn hot in the desert) and camp along Mirror Lake highway in one of the campgrounds or find an open camping spot near the summit or along Soapstone Basin, there are too many options to list them all."

SaltLakeCity,3afjmo,Trinkabell,3,Sat Jun 20 01:11:42 2015 UTC,I would recommend picking up the Benchmark Utah Atlas.  It has detailed road and recreation maps to let you know who owns what and where you are allowed to camp.  There are several different companies that make recreation atlases but in my opinion the Benchmark one is the best: http://www.rei.com/product/776929/benchmark-maps-utah-road-and-recreation-atlas  They sell it at the REI on 33rd S and 33rd E

SaltLakeCity,3afjmo,canyonkid,2,Sun Jun 21 05:21:24 2015 UTC,"I'd stick to an established campground if you've never been camping before; it takes the hassle out of pooping in the wilderness, especially with kids. Bryce Canyon is beautiful and has a great first come first served campground right on the rim of the canyon. If you get there as early as you can, you shouldn't have too much trouble snagging a spot.   If you decide to try dispersed camping, it's fine on BLM land and most Forest Service land (but you typically need to be at least a half mile from the road, so car camping is less feasible). Please just remember to leave no trace; I've seen too many shoddy fire rings in the desert with bits of trash scattered everywhere, and no, your banana peels will not biodegrade quickly enough to be left on the ground.

If you are interested in seeing some cool webs and some neat spiders take a hike up fifth water towards the hot springs and you'll eventually get to a bridge crossing over the river. Spiders have used the gaps on the bridge to build webs catching larger insects flying near the water. I've only seen spiders in the webs at night but they are defiantly the biggest I've seen around here and after you can finish the hike and go hit up the springs.

SaltLakeCity,3ac8a6,wyldcrater,2,Fri Jun 19 06:33:37 2015 UTC,"1.) You can drive to many access points and just start riding. A few good ones are the Hogle Zoo, City Creek (Tough entrance on a bike, very steep), Terrance Hills (easiest), and Dry Creek by the giant U. There are no points in which you have to pay.  2.) For the most part, it is one long continuous trail as long as you follow the marked path. Occasionally, you can stray from the trail and end up on a dead end or different path. Take it as an adventure.   3.) If you are an experienced mountain biker, the trail is very easy. If this is your entry into mountain biking, it is challenging but not that bad. There are not that many uphill portions, dry creek is most likely the most sustained uphill portion but even then it isn't that physically demanding. You can, and should bring your kids up on it! However, it will be incredibly hot so bring plenty of water and wear sunscreen!   Enjoy!"

I've done about 25 batches over a year and a half. I also dont have a ton of disposable income to spend on this so most of my shit is DIY. I'm working on putting together a keezer right now.  That said, I have been really intrigued by the idea of brewing some 10 gallon batches, and changing up a variable like yeast, dry hops, etc into multiple smaller batches and really dialing in what I like. If you want to split a batch of ingredients sometime and brew I would be super into it. Send me a pm and we can exchange email, phone #s, whatever and chat more.    I also enjoy just brewing and eating on the weekend with other like minded people and would be down to do this as well.  Let me know! Prost!"

SaltLakeCity,3a8une,Deforesting,2,Thu Jun 18 14:10:33 2015 UTC,"I researched this once, but am having trouble finding sources ... so it may be totally false.  In a private dwelling, you can be completely nude, given some stipulations:   You are not reasonably visible from a public place (sidewalk, street, etc.) You are not at ground level. (Which ties into #1).   So, if you walk through your living room (at ground level) ,naked, and your blinds are open, and some kid on the sidewalk sees you, you can be nailed for indecent exposure and potentially have to register as a sex offender.  However, anything not at ground level (second story, etc.) is not considered reasonably visible, as they would have to look up. So, if you are on your second-story balcony in the buff ... you're good.   However, there are also lewdness clauses: If you are on the second-floor balcony and are committing sexual acts or are in the state of arousal, then you can get nailed for lewdness.  If you are in your underwear, then you're good, so long as it covers your junk.  If this is something you plan on doing (a lot), IMHO, it is worth it to consult a lawyer for $200 and have them give you a definitive answer.  Now, if an officer is called to the scene and they arrest you, etc., it is not the officer you have to explain the laws to. Don't resist the arrest. They are already choosing to enforce a law they think you broke. The defense comes in court, weeks/months later. Lawyer up, and if the law is on your side, you'll walk out with no damages.    EDIT  Here is a part of the law that talks about Lewdness. An important bit:   A person is guilty of lewdness if [they] performs any of the following acts in a public place or under circumstances which the person should know will likely cause affront or alarm to [...] another who is 14 years of age or older.   So, a public place OR when you should know will likely piss someone off. But that is just if you show your bits. The burden of proof is on the prosecutor to prove you should have known you were going to alarm someone."

SaltLakeCity,3a7j3u,DeadSeaGulls,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:57:51 2015 UTC,"I would say Explosions In the Sky live is probably on the top ten list of Post Rock performances. Same with Sonic Youth as to Alternative Rock. Yet I can only think of one other entertainer in Soul or Neo-Soul to touch where Lee Fields and the expressions are. And that would be James Brown's Night at the Apollo: Revolution of the mind. Which I consider the greatest live album ever recorded ever. Next to that I would put Lee Fields and the expressions. No man in western music today speaks to the heart with the passion and intensity that Lee Fields does. That's why I put him at #1. I only know that the bands you mentioned are popular in indie rock. I am not much a fan of today's ""indie"" rock. So I must apologize and I will give them a listen over the weekend. I try not to be ignorant to all genres of music. But like Henry Rollin's says ""yeah, some music does suck."""
SaltLakeCity,3a7j3u,wbeyda,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:38:55 2015 UTC,"I went through an explosions in the sky phase back after GSY!BE broke up and I was looking for something to fill the post rock void. In the end it was too predictable for me, but pleasant nonetheless. Broken Social Scene have been making killer indie dance music since the 90's.  The National probably isn't a band that you can get into over the weekend. They don't have a short game like that. They make music for 30 somethings that drink too much but are still social.     Future Islands is just throw back to new wave. Nothing special musically, but the lead singer puts on a fucking live show. Dances all over the place and even introduces growls into the pop which is pretty fun.  their albums are okay."

I think If These Trees Could Talk , Way Station are phenomenal post-rock bands. That genre has good things here and there. I like some of the convergence that black metal is taking from it these days. Bands like Ghost Bath, Saor, Deafheaven make good post-black. But that's not for everyone.   I don't drink, I don't dance and the only new wave I like is Devo. So I would probably be a miss on all of those bands haha."

SaltLakeCity,3a6kl9,l-bow-deep,3,Thu Jun 18 00:39:07 2015 UTC,"I questioned the same thing over at /r/mormon.  I never got any information about these two. But I did get more bad things about others in the Kingston family.  Here's what I said there:   I'm not a fan of creating pitchforks and guilt via family relations.  The father is as bad as they come (e.g. beating his daughter unconscious for refusing a forced marriage).  But quick Googling doesn't say much about the two sons running the company.   The brothers insisted that none of the financing came from their father, John Daniel Kingston, 56, patriarch of the wealthy polygamous clan who was jailed for beating his daughter into unconsciousness in 1998 after the girl, then 16, ran away from an arranged marriage to her uncle.  John Daniel Kingston, who pleaded no contest to child abuse and spent 28 weeks in jail, was on hand during Thursday's open house, proudly shooting photographs. According to court testimony, he has had 14 wives and 120 children. ... Jacob Kingston earned a doctorate in mechanical and chemical engineering. His brother, who is plant CFO, earned a degree in economics. (source)[http://www.sltrib.com/news/2630668-155/utah-lawmaker-gets-gop-support-to?fullpage=1]   In another...   Jacob and Isaiah Kingston are the sons of polygamist John Daniel Kingston, one of the leaders of the Kingston clan, which has been in and out of the news with various court cases since 1997. Officials said privately the brothers are not polygamists but all declined to comment on the record beyond saying any reference to polygamy would only cast a negative light on Washakie's success. source   Apparently John Kingston has over 140 children.  But this group is trying to use the dad to slam the company formed by two of those 140.    I'd rather let the two people in charge of Washakie be judged for their own merits.  So what if they give away scholarships, last I checked, that's not a bad thing.  And making a campaign contribution?    Not exactly nefarious."

Now, if I understand your argument; you're saying the sons are fine, deputes employees desiring to testify their company is a scam, and until they do come forwsrd, we should not... what, make people aware of a possible scam?  Did the sons resign from the organization?  Did they decry their father's behavior before it was a public scandal?  Did they turn in evidence against other abuses in the group?  Did they admit that science has disproved Joseoh, and tell the followers that there is no evidence for the Book of Mormon?  Or are they still reaping in huge tithing amounts while protecting the guilty?"

SaltLakeCity,3a6kl9,gdmfr,-4,Thu Jun 18 01:59:21 2015 UTC,"Family intermarrying is a huge part of the Kingston Group’s beliefs. “They’re the ones who really believe they have to keep the bloodline pure,” a former member named Rachel told a Brown University reporter in 2008. “They think they’re directly related to Jesus Christ and they don’t want anything to taint that. As a result they have a lot of deformities and mental illnesses.”   So... I thought the idea of incestuous family intermarriage would be attributed to more than one man.  True, it doesn't call out the sons directly; but it is kinda a damning statement for the group at large   Rachel, who had only seen her father twice in her life, accounts frequent child abuse. She remembers one instance of staying home with her little brother because her family was afraid of letting him go out lest outsiders see his bruises.   Again, not damning to the brothers specifically, but to the group as a whole, it should raise eyebrows.  It should call for concerned voices and loving individuals to see if there is something that can be done.  Now, about Washakie:  Here is the settlement where they paid rather than be investigated about claims that the biodeisle is all a scam: http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/utah-based-washakie-renewable-energy-llc-settles-renewable-fuel-standard-violations  Here is where they settled on EPA violations: http://www2.epa.gov/enforcement/washakie-renewable-energy-llc-clean-air-act-settlement  There are several women who have just left the group with new accusations forth coming.  Again, this isn't a witch hunt, this is a post with information about several businesses tied to a polygamist group with shady dealings that I think many would like to know about.  I didn't call for any pitchforks, but I do think that people should be aware that these businesses funnel money into polygamist groups with some pretty serious allegations against them."

It should call for concerned voices and loving individuals to see if there is something that can be done.   I'll be honest, this attitude scares the bejesus out of me.  Guilt by association.    For example, if I applied for a job out of state, and the hiring panel saw I was from Utah, I'd hate for them to judge me differently based on that alone.  ""Lets assume he's bad unless he's gone on record denouncing positions X, Y, and Z.""     No, we're innocent until proven guilty.  Judge us on our merits.  Don't make assumptions by association."

SaltLakeCity,3a6kl9,Chemspiration,0,Wed Jun 17 17:47:18 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but when it comes to all this weird ass mormon shit I put that on Mormons to solve. I'm not Mormon and never have been but it has always seemed weird to me that the mormon church allows this stuff to happen behind the scenes. I know LDS people say they aren't affiliated with FLDS but to the rest of the world you are all the same. Shows like Big Love, My 5 wives, etc., are all people see outside of Utah, besides the occasional doorknocker, so you would think the people in the polygamy-less faith would do more to express that they are not us. Whatever the case is, I don't give a shit about Washakie. This problem has obviously been brewing for years and since the people in power are all LDS I blame them for allowing it to happen."
SaltLakeCity,3a6kl9,autowikibot,5,Wed Jun 17 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"You have to consider how many people that are apart of mainstream Mormonism probably don't know much about the various polygamy offshoots other than a few of the more popular ones like FLDS.  A lot of people that are a part of the mainstream probably have never heard of the Kingstons and did not know about them, their companies, and the things they do.  In order for Mormons to fix Mormon issues, they need to KNOW about it first.  If enough of them are aware of the issue, and do something about it, there's a chance the issue can get solved."

It would also hike up the fine for someone who parks in a metered spot without paying to $50, generating an estimated $60,000."
SaltLakeCity,3a5yhw,HatuutaH,2,Wed Jun 17 15:04:32 2015 UTC,How do they know if you are expired or simply didn't pay?
SaltLakeCity,3a5yhw,Saucymonk,6,Wed Jun 17 16:26:28 2015 UTC,"It's an electronic system, based off stall numbers. They can look to see when the last paid time was. I don't know though. You'll probably get a ticket, and then when you go to pay, if you show a receipt just with expired time, you'll get the cheaper one. If you can't, you'll get hit for not paying. That's just speculation though. I have the new park slc app, and I can pull up my parking history, so it'd be easy for me to prove my time had expired and I did pay. But the app reminds you as you are getting close to expiring, and allows you to extend without going back to spot. It's pretty cool."

SaltLakeCity,3a5yhw,irondeepbicycle,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:33:54 2015 UTC,Decreasing the availability of parking encourages transit use. This will get more people to take TRAX or buses downtown instead of driving. No problem with this from me - rather have this than a tax increase elsewhere.
SaltLakeCity,3a5yhw,Ceedub260,7,Wed Jun 17 17:03:17 2015 UTC,"It's still cheaper to park for two hours than it is to ride the train round trip.   Edit: and no, if I want to do something like go shopping, I don't want to haul my stuff around on the train. If parking availability decreases, then I go elsewhere."
SaltLakeCity,3a5yhw,Deforesting,0,Wed Jun 17 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"It's not cheaper to drive downtown than to take transit though, almost certainly, and downtown doesn't need any more parking lots so that suburbanites can come to the city and always have it just their way."
SaltLakeCity,3a5yhw,Deforesting,2,Wed Jun 17 18:32:06 2015 UTC,"A day pass for bus and Trax is $6.25, a Trax only roundtrip pass is $5.00, I don't know where you're getting $10 from. Most people aren't going to be parking for free downtown (you are definitely not the norm or expected norm), and pretty gas guzzling vehicles are common enough for Utah, I have no trouble imagining one burning a gallon of gas from Millcreek to, say, City Creek, assuming less than perfect driving. The cost for most travelers to downtown is going to be about the same, or less, to take transit than the cost of driving.  Obviously public transit is going add travel time to your trip, NYC excepted I don't think I have ever in my life been anywhere where public transit was faster than driving, and I guess if maximum time efficiency over all other factors is what you're looking for, then obviously you will be driving, but there's nothing that UTA can do to change that."
SaltLakeCity,3a5yhw,irondeepbicycle,0,Wed Jun 17 18:41:47 2015 UTC,"Are you adding in the cost of gasoline for your trip?  Cause that will vary a lot depending on how far away you are.  Might still be cheaper for you, but it won't be for everyone.  Plus if fares go up, there would be more availability from people who do decide to take transit, making it easier for you to find a place."

SaltLakeCity,3a5yhw,Deforesting,5,Wed Jun 17 22:44:21 2015 UTC,"Such a uniquely Utah complaint. In many (most?) states the major metro's, if not every city, can add to the sales tax. This is generally considered to be not a problem. Major metros, shocking as it may be, have to pay for a little bit more than strip mall hellscape suburbs. I know how much a lot of Utahns hate paying any sort of taxes at all, but I still find this particular complaint to be among the most ridiculous."
SaltLakeCity,3a5yhw,SgtBrowncoat,-4,Wed Jun 17 14:53:20 2015 UTC,"The tax increase proposal is a  bone thrown to the city for the prison move.  The city has to absorb a huge cost and build new infrastructure to accommodate a prison they don't want.  They will have to build a whole new sewage treatment facility for starters.  So the state is the one causing this problem.  But why would I go downtown where I have to pay more tax, pay for parking, deal with shitty traffic caused by absurd bike lanes and useless medians that are two lanes of wasted space when I can more easily, cheaply, and quickly go to a ""suburban hell"" location for the exact same product?"

SaltLakeCity,3a20og,mi1ksteak,12,Tue Jun 16 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think its that the city doesn't care, they've made a lot of progress with chronic homelessness in the past decade. But with the homeless shelter being right there next to gateway, it's going to naturally be the center point for those types."
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,its_all_perspective,10,Tue Jun 16 17:42:03 2015 UTC,I think that the problem is no longer the chronically homeless.
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,qpdbag,4,Tue Jun 16 18:42:48 2015 UTC,"It's the drug dealers that prey on them, more likely."
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,spangborn,7,Tue Jun 16 20:40:46 2015 UTC,"Yep. I live right there on 2nd south and see multiple drug deals, at any time of day, when I'm taking my dogs out."
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,NerdyBrando,5,Tue Jun 16 21:59:09 2015 UTC,I'm 90% certain I saw 3-4 drug deals go down at once on a corner around 8-830am when I had to double back to the marmalade area after I forgot my coffee and had to head back up...think I was going up 400w?  I mean... right in front of the shelter?  You'd figure there would be cops in that area for the main times people are entering/leaving?
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,drdactyl,0,Tue Jun 16 22:14:56 2015 UTC,"That's the frustrating thing. There are always cops around, and I've talked to them on numerous occasions about the constant drug deals and what they are doing about it. Nothing ever happens, or they say they arrest people, and others take their place."
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,NerdyBrando,2,Tue Jun 16 22:24:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're wrong, but you're looking at the issue from a very one-sided perspective. A more visible police presence would do a lot to discourage the dealers from even coming to the area. And I understand the need for addiction recovery services. My spouse's day-to-day profession is addiction recovery services. Providing agency outreach, to people that may not even want the help or to get clean, is not the only solution."
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,NerdyBrando,2,Tue Jun 16 23:46:05 2015 UTC,But it's naive to think the people buying meth and heroin are only buying drugs and not also burgling and vandalizing. I live right in the heart of this area and see what happens. And a lot of property crime happens.
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,NerdyBrando,14,Wed Jun 17 00:41:18 2015 UTC,"That part of the city has been as shit hole for decades. There have been attempts to dress it up that have seen limited success, but it will probably always be an issue."
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,Hank0331,6,Wed Jun 17 00:57:59 2015 UTC,"That part of the city has always been like that. Around the time they built the Gateway they ran the homeless out with extra police forces but I believe that they have mostly given up on that. Your point about city creek is probably right on point.  The soup kitchen is right there so unless they move that, the homeless will continue to hang out in that area. Believe it or not it used to be much worse before it was built up."
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,FurnitureCyborg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:46:43 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. I lived right there (Between 300 and 400 West on 200 South). I have a dog and had to take him down around the corner multiple times a day, but I never saw this kind of stuff until recently (aka, since City Creek opened). Yes, it wasn't one of SLC's nicer areas, but it's even worse than before. But I can certainly believe it was worse before the Gateway was built."

I live right nearby there and all of a sudden just about every day there's a bunch of people laying/sleeping on the grass in front of the college, and spending the night there, etc."
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,paradoxymormon,2,Wed Jun 17 15:54:09 2015 UTC,That motel across from O.C. Tanner is a shit show.
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,-73-,2,Wed Jun 17 18:42:44 2015 UTC,I took my dog for a walk down Memory Grove the other evening (still light) and I was greeted with shopping carts and homeless people sleeping right at the entrance of the off-leash area.
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,workin_hardly,5,Tue Jun 16 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"That's so surprising to me! I live near Memory Grove and often take walks there. I have never seen anything but families, couples, dogs, etc., never homeless people camping out. I want that area to stay a beautiful haven!"

SaltLakeCity,3a20og,rathulacht,2,Tue Jun 16 22:18:38 2015 UTC,There is a police station right across from the homeless shelter that is staffed with officers who spend all day in that area and spend all day arresting people. It hasn't seemed to actually help.

They were blocked by a car in front of them and stopped.  A scruffy looking guy walked up and tried to open the drivers side door, fortunately they were locked.  He then started pounding on the window.  The husband is a concealed carry holder and when he retrieved his firearm the man ran off."

SaltLakeCity,3a20og,city_nightowl,4,Fri Jun 19 13:44:48 2015 UTC,"The real problem is that we don't have enough crisis housing for the homeless. We've made great strides with the chronically homeless, the folks that have been homeless for years, but unfortunately there's a much larger number of non-chronic homeless for which we do not have enough services.  Homeless people sleep during the day because it's not safe for them to sleep during the night. If we had another shelter like the road home, they'd have someplace safe to sleep at night. If we had more drug rehabilitation services, we'd be seeing less of a drug problem. And if larger companies focused more on using profits to hire new workers instead of amassing the profits as capital, we'd see better employment opportunities.  If we don't like seeing people in a pit, the only way out is to help them. Not you or me handing out a few bucks to someone that asks (although you still should do that if you can afford it), but larger, systemic changes and increased funding like we did for the chronically homeless. The only way out is through."
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,ComeShotMcGee,2,Fri Jun 19 14:13:47 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree that it's become worse, but it's always been bad. Hell, recently some kid was selling prescription painkillers on the Planetarium TRAX platform and openly soliciting to everyone who was getting on or off the trains in broad daylight. Years prior, I'd feel relatively safe within Gateway and UTA property after sunset."
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,workin_hardly,2,Wed Jun 17 16:55:52 2015 UTC,"The Gateway needs to bring the trains back and become a central transit hub... Close off Rio Grande street to cars, and run TRAX, buses, FR and Amtrak in there."

SaltLakeCity,3a20og,Chemspiration,2,Wed Jun 17 21:00:53 2015 UTC,Is crack still a thing? I would assume it was meth or heroin. I know what you mean though. I never go to the Gateway for this reason. Not that I feel unsafe but I don't like spending money in front of people who don't have any. It's funny how nice Pioneer Park is on Farmer's Market morning and then the rest of the week it's like whoa
SaltLakeCity,3a20og,ComeShotMcGee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:51:10 2015 UTC,"ohhh yeahhhhh, there isnt actually that much meth, its almost entirely crack and heroin. other than a few meth heads its mostly all heroin, but crack is probably just as big a problem."

It's not just the colors though, they're using cheap materials and cheap designs. They're building us a nice cheap looking city for years to come.  No respect for design, architecture and the beautification of a city."
SaltLakeCity,3a29fc,linguisize,6,Tue Jun 16 19:15:27 2015 UTC,"Do you hate the color or do you hate the fact that it has become ubiquitous?   I mean, I don't particularly care for it either, but I realize why they do it. It's the mentality of building something that no one really has strong feelings for one way or the other rather than something that is more polarizing."
SaltLakeCity,3a29fc,overthemountain,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:33:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not enthusiastic about the colors, but the fact that they're ubiquitous in Salt Lake makes me hate them all together.

SaltLakeCity,3a29fc,LillyGrey666,6,Wed Jun 17 02:44:21 2015 UTC,"Problem is we are a small city surrounded by suburbs. To encourage and entice suburbanites to move into the city you have to make the properties look like the strip mall culture of the burbs. On top of that, stucco is way cheaper than brick or other forms of siding."
SaltLakeCity,3a29fc,SenorKerry,2,Tue Jun 16 18:34:49 2015 UTC,I loathe stucco and stamped concrete but Utah loves both. They're cheap to install but they don't maintain. Which is hardly a problem here because people just rebuild rather than restore anyway.  It's sad.

Thats the camera I have & I used a kit telephoto lens to get this from the other side of the wasatch: http://i.imgur.com/EvsBCFV.jpg  You can see the top of the tram and the last tower right next to the two right-most lightning bolts.  My settings: 72mm, ISO  400, f/7.1, 28s.  Basically you stick the camera on a tripod, put it in bulb mode, get your aperture and ISO settings right, frame the shot, and hit a remote shutter release ($8) to open the shutter, wait 10-30seconds and hope a lightning bolt lands during that time.

I was shooting at 50 ISO, f/8, with a 6-second exposure. You can stop down your aperture to f11 or f16 for a longer exposure, but then the strikes will not be as bright relative to the constant light in the exposure.  There was also some rain on the lens that you can see if you look closely at the image. I stupidly didn't have a tripod, so I just propped the camera on some stuff to try to get a good angle."

With a vibrant trolley system in the early 1900's, cities like Salt Lake had an easy method of transportation for the commuting poor. This all changed when the big car companies started paying cities to rip up their trolley lines, so that consumers would be forced to buy cars. EDIT: and cities would be encourages to buy busses.   The irony is how 100 years later, Salt Lake City is lauded for their recent innovations in public transport.

PLEASE listen to what I have to say carefully.  The University of Utah is one of the most dangerous college campuses in the entire nation. It is also one of the few which allows anybody to carry a gun on campus. Coincidence? I think not.  http://www.american-school-search.com/safety/university-of-utah  There have been over 218 robberies, 4 assaults, and over a dozen forced rapes committed by concealed carriers on the U campus. So much for the idea that people with concealed carry permits are somehow good people in any way, shape, or form.  As a Salt Lake City police officer, I have responded to several of these cases committed by CCW holders on the U campus. Meanwhile, not a single crime in ALL OF Salt Lake COUNTY has been prevented by concealed carry in Utah's history. Guns do not belong on campus. Plain and simple. I don't care if the  Utah State Legislature wants more rapes and assaults at gunpoint on the U campus. The vast majority of employees and students don't. We need to make the U a gun free zone now, or else continue suffering the consequences.   -- /u/Protectorserver"

The various species of Ephedra are widespread in many lands, native to southwestern North America, southern Europe, northern Africa, and southwest and central Asia, northern China, and western South America.   In temperate climates, most Ephedra species grow on shores or in sandy soils with direct sun exposure. Common names in English include joint-pine, jointfir, Mormon-tea or Brigham tea. The Chinese name for the Ephedra species is mahuang (simplified Chinese: 麻黄; traditional Chinese: 麻黃; pinyin: máhuáng; Wade–Giles: ma-huang; literally: ""cannabis yellow""). Ephedra is also sometimes called sea grape (from the French raisin de mer), a common name for the flowering plant Coccoloba uvifera.

SaltLakeCity,39i91o,SLCer,5,Fri Jun 12 02:30:14 2015 UTC,"I don't mind that Burbank has stepped down. I think his handling of some episodes in Salt Lake City over the last year have been pretty disappointing. I envied Burbank, especially his ideas toward immigration and the militarization of the police in this country, but he lost me over the year and I think his resignation will ultimately prove good for the city.  Even still, I'm losing trust and faith in Ralph Becker. At this rate, I have no intention voting for him in either the primary, or the general. I think he's pulled stunt after stunt and instead of actually leading, is playing total politics with the prison and now this."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,eco_was_taken,2,Fri Jun 12 06:09:56 2015 UTC,What cases made you no longer support him?  I can think of his flippant responses to the dog shooting and possibly the death of Dillon Taylor as being controversial. Is there anything I'm missing?  I think even with those blemishes he was a great police chief to have. He has handled many tough situations well. Unless I'm mistaken he even bought police body cameras with surplus budget long before the mayor and city council budgeted for them. Of all the things he could have spent surplus on he spent them on something that increases accountability for police. I don't think most police chiefs would have done that.
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,SLCer,3,Fri Jun 12 15:46:09 2015 UTC,"Yes. Couple that with the harassment and those are three big, big problems that overshadow what he's accomplished. It's not like we're discussing trivial things here."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,cmitchrun,10,Fri Jun 12 18:33:02 2015 UTC,"We have a reporter at Becker's press conference and will have another at Burbank's presser at 4:45, so we will be updating this story as more details emerge.   Edit: We just added the full text of Becker's, quite lengthy, statement on the issue.  Second edit: We've added details from Burbank's press conference. He said he believes the issue was resolved more than a year ago and that this is a political move. The video of the whole thing is now online, and we've added a lot more quotes and context."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,pashdown,16,Thu Jun 11 22:23:49 2015 UTC,"Becker said that he had sent a corrective action letter to Burbank about one year ago regarding the issue.   I'm sorry, but if he has known about it for a year, then he is just as much at fault. He just is trying to cover his ass, now that this scandal has been exposed."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,cmitchrun,9,Thu Jun 11 22:19:05 2015 UTC,...and the date for candidates to file against him passed last Monday.
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,radmarshallb,6,Thu Jun 11 23:35:44 2015 UTC,"I am so happy, that I no longer work for Salt Lake City! Good riddance to that shit show! Becker basically pushed the Fire chief to 'retire' because of the chiefs differing views."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,cmitchrun,3,Thu Jun 11 23:54:30 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about your thoughts on this. I'm not pro-Becker by any means, but it does seem reasonable to me to try and resolve a matter with a subordinate internally as it appears, based on the documents he released and the reporting I've seen, Becker tried to do over the course of the last year."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,radmarshallb,4,Fri Jun 12 02:42:07 2015 UTC,"I just think that a year is an awful long time to let something go. And mayor Becker even stated in his public address, that the case had  renewed interest, and the media attention. So it makes me wonder how it would have been handled by Becker, if the media had not become aware of it. And if that is how he conducts himself, then he is just as much to blame."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,cmitchrun,2,Fri Jun 12 05:09:38 2015 UTC,"I understand that a year is a long time to deal with a situation, but I also understand that firing the Chief of Police is not something you do on an impulse. I'm leaning in favor of the idea that Mayor Becker didn't handle the situation as prudently as he should have, but that that Chief Burbank also didn't respond appropriately to his boss' requirements and Burbank had to go. Seems like a bad situation all around."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,jortr0n,2,Fri Jun 12 05:19:36 2015 UTC,I completely agree! The whole situation was handled really poorly all around.
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,cmitchrun,9,Fri Jun 12 05:32:51 2015 UTC,That's what happens when elections are months away.

SaltLakeCity,39i91o,TheBadWolf,7,Fri Jun 12 00:32:28 2015 UTC,"All I am saying, is that mayor Becker should have taken more action a year ago. But now for him to suddenly push for Chief Burbanks resignation, it just seems a little too convenient."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,rachie27,7,Fri Jun 12 02:03:36 2015 UTC,"The chief's handling of this situation has been inexcusable, which is a shame considering I think he's done a great job throughout the rest of his career."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,waaarg,7,Fri Jun 12 02:04:59 2015 UTC,"This may not be popular opinion but I think it's an over reaction. It's Burbank's team and I think he knows what's best. This was a small thing, not a huge incident. Seems like a power play by Becker.  Also, I think it will make sexual harassment reports scarier for individuals to report in the future in fear that it'll blow up and cause harm to someone not directly involved, just like this case did."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,DesertCedar,3,Fri Jun 12 05:13:01 2015 UTC,"It is totally a political power play by Becker. This has been an ongoing issue for a year now, and he suddenly chose today to do this.   Of course, I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that it has recently been brought up in the news and he is running in a contested election, of course not...."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,ShagNastey801,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:44:31 2015 UTC,There is a copy of a letter up thread that the Mayors office sent to Burbank a year ago. Sheds some light into the culture of SLPD as Becker's office sees it.
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,SLCer,4,Thu Jun 11 23:40:37 2015 UTC,"The Mayor is a power hungry tyrant a two faced oppressor who'd do anything to keep his throne. This is just a classic game of big dicking and sadly Chief Burbank lost because of his personal beliefs. Sure he could have handled it better, but the mayor should be outed just like the Chief. He and his ""team"" did not handle this appropriately a year ago; The only reason they are now is because it's election year.... #DisbandBecker"

SaltLakeCity,39i91o,hippie_valley,2,Thu Jun 11 23:53:47 2015 UTC,"Then what is Becker? He works with the rest of the state and gets what? Hell, he couldn't even keep a minor league soccer stadium within the city's borders."

SaltLakeCity,39i91o,DjArson,0,Fri Jun 12 14:23:11 2015 UTC,"Ugh, as much as I dislike Burbank, he's being made a scapegoat. Yes, he screwed up the handling of this situation, but there's more at play here.  Becker is getting to make look like an idiot over letting this happen by his opponents. He wants to look good, so he has to do something. He can't fire Findlay (because he's gone), and he can't take away Findlay's benefits. So what does he do? He fires the guy who should have fired Findlay but didn't.  Becker looks like a moron here, because he had stated that he would let Burbank handle personnel matters within the PD, saying that he didn't have full knowledge of the situation. Now that the situation (and lawsuit) is impacting his ability to get re-elected, he's taking action. If Becker truly had an issue with the way Burbank had handled Findlay, he should have fired Findlay himself.  Burbank has done a lot right as chief, but this is one situation where the cronyism in police departments causes massive problems."
SaltLakeCity,39i91o,DjArson,-5,Fri Jun 12 18:45:17 2015 UTC,"Chief Chris Burbank served our community valiantly for over twenty years. I served with him on the SLCPD SWAT team back in the 1990's, where he was my mentor. As he rose up in the ranks, he never forgot the officers serving under him, and we were all grateful for his effective leadership, making Salt Lake city the safest city in a dangerous state.  Unfortunately, Chief Burbank cared enough about public safety to challenge the NRA. Half a year ago, he made statements supporting further gun control. As a fellow law enforcement officer, I supported his statements wholeheartedly. Easy access to guns has made the US, Utah included, one of the most dangerous places in the world, and it is in the public's best interests to fix this issue.  However, the gun lobby was not too happy about this. And they put the heat on Mayor Ralph Becker. Becker talks a good game about supporting public safety and gun reform but he admitted that he ""doesn't really care about gun violence that much."" He hasn't made any effort to reduce gun death in this great city at all, despite holding the office for almost a decade now. He'd much rather focus on ways to increase his power, instead of growing a pair and making his city safer.  Basically, over the past few days, the talk has been spreading like wildfire among my fellow officers. Apparently, the NRA offered Mayor Becker a pretty hefty donation for his reelection campaign, if only he would promise not to enact any gun control laws, AND if he fired Chief Burbank.  The Mayor, facing an uncertain reelection race with a handful of strong opponents, quickly bowed to the gun lobby's money. The sexual assault issue? Just an excuse for the press about why he was forcing Chief Burbank to resign. That was why the sexual assault issue was brought up now, and not when it happened last year.  Chief Burbank fell victim to the dark money of the Gun Lobby, and it's corrupting effects on our mayor. He will not be the only victim. Each year, 22 of my fellow officers are shot in the line of duty, with guns bought legally without a background check at gun shows. https://www.odmp.org/agency/3426-salt-lake-city-police-department-utah  I cannot offer you any ""proof"" of this dirty deal between Becker and the NRA, because the entire SLCPD is being hushed by the Becker regime. If I were to openly come out with this information, I would lose my job even quicker than Chief Burbank did, and I have a family to feed. I will say, however, that the truth WILL come out eventually. And as the murder rate by gun continues to climb in Utah, we will wish we had a caring, determined chief like Chris Burbank to guide us through the storm.   In the meantime, if you wish to prevent the NRA from targeting any more honorable, dutiful public servants, please make a small donation, if you can afford it, to Everytown for Gun Safety, or the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Both of these organizations work hand in hand with Law Enforcement officers like Chief Burbank or myself to sway public opinion to enact common sense gun reform."

Their GM seems very knowledgable and is a cool guy (I've played MtG with him).

SaltLakeCity,39im1z,SenorKerry,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:44:06 2015 UTC,"The best part about this? Boyer is the same company that built the Gateway and abandoned it, selling to an out-of-state company that let it to fall to shambles."
SaltLakeCity,39im1z,spangborn,8,Fri Jun 12 19:03:19 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue is that it'll likely all look the same. It won't look organic because, frankly, it ain't organic. One of my biggest issues with the Gateway is that it's all the same - every building is the same color, style and nearly the same height.   What makes neighborhoods is the uniqueness of the architecture. My guess is that pretty much every building will look the same and its small scope means that it'll have minimal interaction with any real neighborhood in that area."
SaltLakeCity,39im1z,SLCer,6,Fri Jun 12 06:13:50 2015 UTC,"Our culture is into building cartoon facades of real places, not actual real places."
SaltLakeCity,39im1z,gthing,6,Fri Jun 12 06:40:02 2015 UTC,Absolutely. The Gateway is a horrific mess of architecture. There are so many good ways to develop stuff - and allowing it organically does help. The same shit is happening in SugarHouse where it's all the same and all ugly as fuck.
SaltLakeCity,39im1z,SLCer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:52:38 2015 UTC,"Well, really, how often do you see mixed-use development like this popping up organically? Our fastest growing population centers are our suburbs, and retail pops up in commercial-specific districts. They mix like oil and water the way we plan things now.  Even though this kind of development feels artificial and fake, if it starts to take off then we can get people creating more of this kind of stuff naturally. I view this sort of ""astro-turf"" development as step 1."
SaltLakeCity,39im1z,ExUnoPlures,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:04:30 2015 UTC,You don't - but you can through zoning. But I disagree with the 'astro-turf' development being step one. That was the Gateway - not this - and it hasn't led to anything earth-shattering in that area behind cookie cutter development and more artificial development.

SaltLakeCity,39id73,racei,3,Thu Jun 11 23:49:03 2015 UTC,"Their job descriptions explain most of their reactions.  Chief Burbank has always had the mindset of an officer, but a police chief needs to play the political field as well, giving statements to the press and public forums.  He has never been good at that.  To a police officer an apology is a confession, used to strong-arm into an unequal position, leveraged by a prosecutor to get an easy conviction and severe punishment.  If an officer can coerce a 'good apology' they can do the evil laugh, ""Mwa ha ha! I have you now!""  To the mayor and other politicians, an apology is a PR statement, designed to gain publicity, used to get popularity, leading to re-election. To a politician a 'good apology' means their polling numbers go up several percentage points.  That is the radical difference between them.    TL;DR: I know these parts are a bit longer than normal Reddit two-sentence statements, but they explain WHY they have the attitude they do.  Both of them see the world differently.    The officer perspective makes sense in their world.  Chief Burbank has always had the attitude of an officer. He tells his subordinates what they are to do, and they do it.  He gives commands and edicts and they are followed precisely and without question. When someone under his command deviates or asks questions, like an officer requesting a different position at a Pride parade to do crowd control rather than a performance, his officer mentality says ""No, I am in charge and you follow my commands.""  When it comes to public apology, the officer is trained to NEVER admit fault. NEVER apologize. An apology implies you are wrong, and then the department could be liable.  Never apologize for a shooting, it implies you made a mistake.  Never apologize for injuring someone, say it was necessary to do the job.  Never apologize for property damage, or shooting a dog, or causing a crash. Always say it was done in the line of duty, that you could see not alternatives in the heat of the moment, etc.  With all that officer training, being told by his boss to read an apology goes against everything he (as an officer) has been trained. In that world view, he is capitulating.   To an officer, a big public apology is giving up all his power.    The mayor's perspective also makes sense in their world.  To the mayor, a quick and skilled apology is a PR move. A good public apology is a great PR move.  For something bad, the press can talk about it for a day or two and it quickly leaves the public stage.  For something not very bad, or if the polling numbers say the public want to hear more, the politician can milk it for all it is worth.     To a politician, making a big public apology means gaining more power, or ending a loss of power.    Understanding those different views, the mayor's statements make sense (chief is throwing away his career over a simple apology) and the officer's statements make sense (nobody is throwing me under the bus by extracting a confession apology)."

SaltLakeCity,39gy3v,joshmobile,20,Thu Jun 11 17:22:57 2015 UTC,"Autoplaying some weird audio?  That's annoying. So this is a terrible website. It took me a while just to figure out what exactly the issue was. So the cops are harassing the owner of a bar? How about stories relating to the actual harassment, or reasons you are being harassed other than some vague statement about how you have proof of harassment. Is this just Canyon Inn, or are other businesses involved?   So are the cops messing with the bar because the city wants that property for development or because it's a bar? Does Hog Wallow get the same type of harassment?"
SaltLakeCity,39gy3v,gwar37,4,Thu Jun 11 17:41:21 2015 UTC,Basically the police are harassing the Canyon Inn (and have been for years) because the development going up behind them planned on buying the property and using it as an entrance. The Canyon Inn refused to sell though and the contractor building the development has a lot of money to throw around so the police agreed to pull over any car leaving the Canyon Inn in order to force out business.   Hogs Wallow does not get the same treatment because it is not blocking the development. This is the first I have heard that they want to close the 7-11 though - good luck with that because it is one of the busier 7-11's in the country.   The Canyon Inn should try and do a partnership with Lyft or Uber to get discount rides to and from their bar in order to keep customers coming in.
SaltLakeCity,39gy3v,oculardrip,3,Thu Jun 11 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"And they have proof of this? Also, I think that 7-11 is one of the busiest 7-11s in the country, I swear I read that somewhere. So yeah, it's not going anywhere."
SaltLakeCity,39gy3v,gwar37,4,Thu Jun 11 22:20:49 2015 UTC,"so the police agreed to pull over any car leaving the Canyon Inn in order to force out business.   Where is the evidence?     If they say it has been going on for five years, they ought to have an enormous body of evidence by now.  Video recordings showing that they ""pull over any car leaving the Canyon Inn"" should be fairly easy to create.   Even if they are pulling over a high percentage, like 10% of all customers, that should be easy to document as well.  With actual evidence available, I can easily imagine the Inn pursuing a civil lawsuit. This would not require any near-useless online petition.  From the small amount I've read, it looks like officers are doing the same they do at many other bars. Officers lurk outside the bar and watch for people who appear intoxicated and pull them over.    If there is evidence they are doing these without cause (just pulling everyone over without evidence of intoxication) then a civil suit is in order."
SaltLakeCity,39gy3v,rabid_briefcase,4,Thu Jun 11 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"I've got 4 traffic tickets in the past 3 years leaving canyon inn, and 2 of those stops have involved breathalyzers. My friends really like going there for some reason (not my favorite place)... I rarely drink and am often the DD. There was only one time that I had a drink and got breathalyzed and blew a .051, the other time I didn't have anything in my system. The reasons I was told I was pulled over have been for expired tags (1 month off), failure to signal right turn, and speeding (speeding was dropped). I had passengers every time. i'm sure there is data to support this stuff that the city has. You could run it through some GIS program and show it on a map probably. From alot of the stuff I've read and seen about cottonwood heights city government, they seem to head-butt with the citizens of the community quite a bit. I really would be interested in sitting in a city hall meeting."
SaltLakeCity,39gy3v,Cr00bs23,5,Thu Jun 11 21:09:29 2015 UTC,"That ignores the point.  They need evidence, not anecdotes.  And they need lawsuits, not online petitions.  Their petition says it has been going on for five years.  And your comment gives anecdotal instances, but that is not enough. Anecdotal stories 'I got pulled over four times' and online petitions will not change the situation.  If the Inn is concerned about (alleged) police harassment, an online petition is the wrong method.  The correct method is to collect hard evidence and file a civil lawsuit.  If it is actually happening, and it very well may, then they really need to sue.  Nothing short of that will get results.  To get evidence for their suit they need to set up cameras outside their business that record the street entrance and record the public streets crossing it.  For bonus points, they need to have a big sign in the business with a contact information if they have been pulled over so they can gather even more information, and probably print the information on receipts and give it out on flyers.  Then, in short order, they'd be able to get actual numbers for what percentage of people are stopped, and what they are stopped for.  And they'll have video evidence of the harassment that goes a long way in modern civil lawsuits.  If the people are stopped for actual infractions that are supported by the video -- such as your expired tags, or people who are actually intoxicated shown by breathalyzer test  -- then the officers are doing the right thing.  Annoying to the business and the customers, yes, but correct for society. If the intersection has a large number of actual infractions, then the officers are correct to heavily patrol and cite those infractions.  But if they are not actual issues the groups are right that it needs to stop.   Anyone who is pulled over could also contact the company and get the video, to really discover if they signaled or not. If they did, that will make some great evidence both to fight the ticket and for the business to sue.  If there are a large number of stops that don't result in actual citations, or if the citations are bogus like a claim of failure to signal where the Inn's recording shows the person did signal, then the Inn can stop the foolish ineffective online petition and move to a more concrete civil lawsuit.  If there are a large number of cases where there is no probable cause, the officer pulled the car over because it came from a bar not because there was any stronger evidence of intoxication, that too is evidence against the officers.  And if that is the case, where the officers are not seeing a high volume of actual problems or stopping drivers without proper cause, then with that evidence in hand I certainly hope they win the lawsuit."

So they knew the Health Dept. was coming to do an inspection today, and they probably cleaned up all sorts of scary stuff, but they still didn't think to get the food off the floor!  Clearly the staff is not well trained, if they can't remember to wash their hands when the food inspector with the clipboard is standing there watching..."

SaltLakeCity,39h7y9,RoyalVelvet,2,Thu Jun 11 18:19:23 2015 UTC,"How long are you going to have? What kind of food do you like? Whereabouts in Provo?  Well anyway here's a few thoughts. From Provo Canyon to American Fork Canyon is the Alpine Loop Byway. Lovely area. You can also take the Alpine Loop Backway. Check out Cascade Springs, then take the gravel road into the Heber Valley. Heber is a quaint little town. Heber isn't too far from historic Park City, big ski/sundance film festival town in the winter, nice and mellow in the summer. Park near Main Street and walk around, there are a lot of restaurants near each other, just pick one that sounds good or I recommend Handle if you're looking for contemporary creative American cuisine. If that's not your style there's pizza and a brewpub and well tons of other places.   You'll take I-80 through Parley's Canyon back to Salt Lake City. I recommend exiting on Foothill Blvd, that will take you across the east side, near the University of Utah, and then down 500/400 South into Salt Lake City itself. Check it out. Good places to eat include Copper Onion for modern American cuisine, Cannella's for Italian, Jimmy John's, Takeshi for Sushi, Squatter's for a brewpub, probably lots of places I'm forgetting.   I'll leave hikes/camping to the people who actually go outside."
SaltLakeCity,39h7y9,LordPizzaParty,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:38:46 2015 UTC,"I think that the drive From Salt Lake City to Boise is incredibly boring if you stay on the freeway.  I've driven it many, many times with kids, and here are our go-to stops:  Yes, it's faster to just cruise on the Freeway, but, go ahead and take the exit into Twin Falls, and be prepared to enjoy the view from the Perrine Bridge! Then have a picnic lunch 10 minutes away at Shoshone Falls.  There are some short trails to various view points.  If you want to enjoy a much more scenic route, then continue on up through the Hagerman valley on Highway 30 towards Bliss, but I usually get back on the freeway, and then be sure to stop at the Malad Gorge State Park!!  As you can see from the photo, the freeway crosses over a part of the gorge.  There are some great short trails to viewpoints, and a footbridge over the narrowest part of the gorge.  It's breathtaking.  If time allows, you might also want to consider making a detour through Bruneau Dunes State Park.  There are some nice short hikes there, and it's a pretty cool place (The camping is meh... no shade).  But don't bother if it's gonna be windy.  You'll get sand in your eyes.  I guarantee it.  Anyway, those are some of the stops I like to make on the way to/from Boise from SLC.  Otherwise it's a long boring drive!"
SaltLakeCity,39h7y9,kirkbenge,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:36:55 2015 UTC,"If you would like to spend a couple hours and dollars, you can easily get to 11,000 feet with hardly any excursion. Take Little Cottonwood Canyon up to Snowbird, exit towards the Tram. The Tram will take you up the mountain ridge and drop you off at hidden peak, which is 11,000 feet exactly. Pretty fun, and provides a great view!   If you are looking for a fun, and relatively easy hike - try Millcreek canyon, specifically the overlook trail. I believe it is 3 miles round trip, doesn't go over anything technical and leaves you with a wonderful view of Salt Lake valley.   As far as in-between SLC and Boise, unless you are willing to take a long detour (a few hours) there is not much to see. If I were you, I'd hurry through the 5 boring hours and get to Boise. Once in Boise, check out Hyde Park. There are many great spots to each, and drink a [real] beer. Boise is almost exactly like Salt Lake but with less Mormons and more foothills. Another fun place to check out in Boise is 8th street, it really is a great town to walk or bike around too."

Let me know if you'd like directions. It's a little over 30 minutes from Salt Lake City.  If you go a little farther (past Heber), then Deer Creek Reservoir has higher quality fishing. You can also fish from several places off the shore. In addition to bass, Deer Creek has walleye (my personal favorite). This will take around an hour from the valley.  I've also heard that Utah lake, particularly on the southside, has largemouth and white bass in addition to walleye and catfish. I'm not sure how good it is, though."

SaltLakeCity,39dov0,fake_somebody,3,Thu Jun 11 03:03:44 2015 UTC,You should do really well depending on your lifestyle. Where are you moving from? That can have an impact too. There are cost of living calculators you can Google that show the differences on how to live from market to market.  The housing near the U does tend to be more expensive than the suburbs however...

SaltLakeCity,3982w4,cmitchrun,9,Tue Jun 9 22:52:12 2015 UTC,"So, I know someone who works in homelessness services for the city, which has given me an understanding of how this helps.   Before his current position, he always gave money to panhandlers because he has a big heart. Once he started working closely with HOST and the Road Home he stopped, because he realized that giving money to para handlers helps nothing. By giving directory to organizations like the shelter or the HOST program, the money you want to use to help people actually gets used for things people need. The less money that is given to panhandlers, the less the ones who are doing it as a scam will come around, and those who are truly homeless will be forced to seek services where they are provided using your donated funds for food rather than smack."
SaltLakeCity,3982w4,joseph_sith,8,Wed Jun 10 14:15:56 2015 UTC,Not to mention the $10 in my pocket can be stretched much further when used by an organization with many ties to other organizations vs. giving directly to the person in need.  That might buy them one meal from Subway or it could buy several meals from a much larger vendor.

SaltLakeCity,3982w4,thebradhimself,33,Wed Jun 10 00:43:49 2015 UTC,Because most of the panhandlers are scam artists and not actually homeless.
SaltLakeCity,3982w4,jerisad,9,Wed Jun 10 01:39:05 2015 UTC,"Many are legitimately homeless. I worked at a sketchy downtown motel for a year and a lot of people would stand by the off-ramp until they had enough cash for a room for the night plus a daily fix of their drug of choice, and that was their daily cycle. This place was a hub for dealers and pimps, you could get anything there. By supporting panhandlers you're basically supporting a privatized homeless shelter that is chock full of drugs and violence."

SaltLakeCity,3982w4,wwwehtam,2,Fri Jun 12 01:18:29 2015 UTC,"The City Library rescheduling to around the clock hours is not for homeless people to have a place to go. That has never been the intention.  The purpose of opening the City Library 24/7 would be to elevate Salt Lake City to a world-class metro area, build community, serve all patrons whose schedule is not compatible with daytime hours and generate a vibrant, well-cultured and educated downtown core, which is essential in the 21st century as people are flocking to urban areas.  You should work on your compassion for others. I know you would not appreciate the rejection and blind assumptions you're exuding now if you found yourself in their situation."
SaltLakeCity,3982w4,wwwehtam,-4,Fri Jun 12 05:32:38 2015 UTC,"This is posted up near City Creek, it appears? You're gettin' smoke blown up your ass if you think this is about preventing homeless people from buying narcotics. It's about segregating haves and have-nots.  I have been in SLC for less than a year now after living in a few real cities, and only here have I seen this kind of mentality so rampant.  Sure, if you don't want to give someone your money you ""worked your ass of for"" then that's your own damn prerogative. And if you'd rather give to a non-profit, out of your own accord, than to someone on the street, then sure that's respectable. But that ""Downtown SLC"" logo at the bottom, the notion that the city is sponsoring this and encouraging residents to not help others less fortunate is not evident of a compassionate city but a discriminatory one.  This is so out of hand, we need signs posted to remind people? The homeless population isn't even that bad here, comparatively.   Pretty lame of you... salt lake. not chill"

Shortly after the crisis began, they demanded 234 prisoners jailed in Israel and the German-held founders of the Red Army Faction (Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof) be released.   Black September called the operation ""Iqrit and Biram"",  after two Palestinian Christian villages whose inhabitants were expelled by the Haganah in 1948.

SaltLakeCity,395r4o,fruhling,2,Tue Jun 9 23:11:28 2015 UTC,"The Utah Department of Workforce Services is responsible for coordinating all the efforts in Utah regarding homelessness. They define it here as:   Homelessness is difficult to classify. Several federal agencies have different definitions based on how they characterize the needs of the populations they serve. The data in this report uses the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s definition of homelessness, which was updated in January 2012 as a part of the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act. This new definition includes four categories of homelessness including:  • Literally Homeless: An individual or family who lacks a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence and has a primary nighttime residence that is a place not meant for human habitation, an emergency shelter, transitional housing, or are exiting an institution where they stayed a short time (90 consecutive days or less) and who resided in an emergency shelter or place not meant for human habitation prior to entering the institution.  • Imminent Risk of Homelessness: An individual or family who will lose their primary nighttime residence within 14 days, have not identified subsequent housing, and lacks the networks or resources to find subsequent housing.  • Homeless Under Other Federal Statutes: Unaccompanied youth (under age 25) or families with children who do not meet either category 1 or 2, but have been persistently unstably housed (have not had a lease or ownership in housing), or have had two or more moves in the last 60 days, and are defined as homeless under other federal statutes.  • Fleeing/Attempting to Flee Domestic Violence: Any individual or family who is fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, has no other residence, and lacks the networks or resources to find subsequent housing.   A person is considered chronically homeless if he or she has a disabling condition and has been homeless for at least one year continually or four times in three years. This definition is currently being amended to further clarify the time spent homeless and how to identify disabling conditions. A homeless family may be considered chronically homeless if an adult within the family meets this definition."

Instead of giving your change to a panhandler put it in this meter. The money goes straight to local shelters and outreach programs to help the homeless.

SaltLakeCity,395r4o,varthalon,7,Tue Jun 9 21:54:21 2015 UTC,"The amount they make varies vastly dependent on such factors as how aggressive they are, how bad they look, if they have a good place to panhandle from, and the charity/gullibility of the people in the areas.  Some studies have shown that professional pan-handlers can easily make 80k per year and in some cases more than $182 per hour. But I'm a bit leary of the studies I was able to find with a quick Google search. News stations and little .orgs tend to not be very good with their research.  I do remember a local news report here in Utah a couple of years ago were they surveilled one lady who was panhandling near Temple Square. When she finished she walked a few blocks, got into her Mercedes and they followed her 400k house in South Jordan.  Yes there are panhandlers that are legitimately poor in Utah but the professional panhandlers that aren't are the ones you usually run into since they are the once that know how to work both You and the System."

You said that I would be ""surprised."" I had to assume you meant that I'd be surprised by the number of people who quit their jobs in order to join the lucrative career of panhandling, because that was the context.   Now you're switching the argument to whether or not there exists at least one person who is so lazy that he/she is too lazy to get a job and lands on panhandling, which is impossible to argue against, and is also impossible to say about this person:    I doubt anyone's going to quit their job to bother people in front of Smith's.   Which was the case that I expected to see a counterexample for.   Is panhandling mostly an alluring option that otherwise rational people choose from multiple options out of greed as OP implied? Is panhandling mostly the result of poor work ethic as you stated? Or is it mostly a desperate and humiliating decision made by people struggling to function in society? Which of these scenarios sounds like actual people instead of caricatures?"

SaltLakeCity,395r4o,antons_key,21,Tue Jun 9 14:59:35 2015 UTC,"The government defines homelessness as chronic when people have been on the streets for more than a year at a time, or homeless four times in the last three years. They also must have been reliably diagnosed with a major debilitating condition such mental or physical illness, alcoholism or drug dependency.   So they are probably people that don't fit the definition of chronic. The ""temporary"" homeless."
SaltLakeCity,395r4o,The_Crass-Beagle_Act,7,Tue Jun 9 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"I think that the fact that a good portion of the people down around the shelters are transient homeless plays into it as well, which is why they're typically found around the train yard.

SaltLakeCity,395r4o,pierrotlefou,6,Tue Jun 9 16:59:11 2015 UTC,Excellent. Now they just need to outlaw panhandling.
SaltLakeCity,395r4o,fruhling,3,Tue Jun 9 21:57:16 2015 UTC,"The courts won't allow it.  It would seem it is difficult to differentiate between panhandling and free speech.  The Downtown Alliance is trying to get a new panhandling law through, but it doesn't actually block panhandling.  Fun."

SaltLakeCity,395r4o,furcifer89,2,Tue Jun 9 23:27:52 2015 UTC,"The only thing that can be made illegal is so-called aggressive panhandling.

SaltLakeCity,395r4o,AvatarJack,3,Tue Jun 9 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"many of the ""homeless"" you see are transients that are just riding the rails around america and passing through. Some just got booted out of their apartment because they blew their money on any number of vices, but will be able to save up and afford a place shortly.   Some lost their jobs but are able to work. Chronically homeless people are the ones with severe addiction or mental/physical health issues. These are the homeless that have been homeless for at least a year and are in the most dire need of help getting reintegrated to society."
SaltLakeCity,395r4o,watersign,4,Tue Jun 9 17:53:10 2015 UTC,"Their target is the chronically homeless. Folks that have been homeless for a long, long time take a lot of focus to rehabilitate into people that are ready to live in a house and be self-sufficient. Without that strong, concerted effort, chronically homeless people can take up a lot of time in services and treatment places like the downtown shelter, kind of like having to pay off a lot of interest without touching the debt itself. So hopefully now with the long-term homeless in recovery, there'll be a better chance to assist the short-term homeless, which should have a higher turnover rate. This strategy is still quite new, so it might be a few years before we see the real effects it has on the metropolitan homeless population."

Sugarhouse also has a little ""arts festival"" down 1100 East with some music, food trucks and local shops participating.  Sugarhouse park has activities all day.   Don't plan on driving out of there after the fireworks.  Plan on going to a bar and watching the exodus of people for an hour or two."

Of course after that we hire some waify models and throw on some heavy sun filters and take pics of them looking like hippies in a field in an unrealistic environment with no bugs or snakes just hipsters and feathers. pricing will be high - $40 and up for a tank top, and we will make sure that our product ""sells out"" but we will notify users of when it gets back in stock - like when we turn the button back on the site."

Also HTML, CSS, jquery, and javascript are very common skills, so you are facing a lot of competition, and almost all of it will be backed by a degree and/or years of experience.  You want my honest advice as someone inside the the industry, enroll in college, slap that on your resume, and put your resume up on dice and/or monster. Also create samples of your work, and answer questions on stack exchange, because you need to demonstrate your knowledge since you don't have a degree or a career to demonstrate it for you.   With that and a bit of luck someone might see you as a bargain solution to a problem, and give you a crap job. Cherish it, knock it out of the park, and ask for a reference.

SaltLakeCity,39726e,foxer57,5,Tue Jun 9 18:49:30 2015 UTC,America First!
SaltLakeCity,39726e,Saucymonk,5,Tue Jun 9 19:31:27 2015 UTC,I will also vouch for America First. I made the switch to them over 6 years ago when Wells Fargo was royally ticking me off. I couldn't be happier.  They also seem to be pretty good at keeping ahead of others when it comes to technology. They included an app for the first generations of Android (when even the big name banks had yet to come aboard). Their newest thing that I make others a bit envious is their ability to send someone money through an email or text (via popmoney). Really simple way to pay someone back without having to hit up an ATM.
SaltLakeCity,39726e,Kulban,2,Tue Jun 9 19:39:11 2015 UTC,"Is popmoney kind of like Chase QuickPay? You send them money, they sign up for an account linked to their bank account, and everything just transfers?  I just opened an America First account (got a loan through them), and if popmoney can replace QuickPay, I'll move everything over."
SaltLakeCity,39726e,corezero,2,Wed Jun 10 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"Never used Chase Quickpay, but that sounds exactly like it.  They get a link to sign up to receive it.  Before that, I would just use America First's free billpay to send people money.  They cut checks and mail them and can it do it just once or on a schedule."

SaltLakeCity,39726e,imraven,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:06:55 2015 UTC,"America First is universally praised by my friends, but I have to talk bad about Mountain America.  I went with them over America First on a car loan several years ago because the interest rate was a quarter of a percent lower, and I came to regret it.  I eventually ran into some financial troubles and found myself unable to make payments for a few months.  My friends who had worked with America First had told me plenty of stories of how America First was really willing to work with them in similar situations, if the debt didn't just get forgiven altogether.  Mountain America was unwilling to work with me at all and eventually repossessed my car and told me that the only way I could get it back was to pay the entire owed amount on top of about 25% more in fees, plus I had to pay the tow company a dumb storage fee of $150 for having my car for a day.  I ended up having to borrow a bunch of money from a couple of very nice friends and family members to deal with it all, but it really felt like way more trouble than I should have had to go through as someone who was always paying on-time and made an effort to let them know about my situation when it arose.  My friends who have always said America First was great were blown away by how Mountain America treats customers in comparison.  Maybe I'm a very unlucky or uncommon case, but I would never recommend or choose Mountain America over America First again.  I have yet to have any of my friends say anything bad about America First, and based on what they tell me they are above and beyond Mountain America in all of the ways that really matter.  You may, like in my case, get a slightly better deal with Mountain America, but when it comes at the cost of having terrible customer service and them being unwilling to deal with people who run into a rough patch, it's just so not worth it."

SaltLakeCity,39726e,soapy_goatherd,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"Shit happens.  I learned a lot of valuable lessons from the incident, most notably that you shouldn't always go for the ""best deal"" and should consider more than what is on the paper.  The other being that you should always have a ""rainy day fund"" for when those shitty times happen and you are unfortunate enough to be working with people who couldn't care less.  It did suck but sometimes shitty things have to happen to you for you to learn to avoid them.  One funny thing though; to this day, Mountain America still sends me spam trying to get me to ""come back"" and open an account with them.  Really?"

SaltLakeCity,392djc,brockobear,2,Tue Jun 9 18:01:25 2015 UTC,"That's actually pretty do-able around the U. Have you checked City View? I lived there for a few years and the 2-bedrooms last year were 800-900. Older buildings, but well-kept. If you're not opposed to basement apartments, stuff usually comes up just to the south of the U. When I was looking last year, there were also some 2 bedrooms closer to downtown. We looked at Park Capitol and thought it was slightly overpriced, but probably still in your range. There's also a slew of older buildings running up 100 S and 200 S on the east side of downtown that'll be in that range. Most of them have their ""For Rent"" signs with numbers up already.  In general, check KSL.com/rentler the most and do some drive arounds. I will say, however, that you'll probably have better luck starting towards the end of this month and into July and August. A lot of leases are up between June 30 and July 31.  EDIT: Rentler link for a search I just did."
SaltLakeCity,392djc,CatLadyLacquerista,3,Tue Jun 9 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"If you want to live on the east side, you are going to have a bad time finding ""fairly affordable"".  2 bedroom is on the larger side.  The BEST chance you have for finding a good deal is to literally drive/walk around the area you want to live in and look for ""for rent"" signs.  Otherwise you need to accept either living on the west side or further south/north if you want to have rent under $1000 for a 2 bedroom apt that isn't crap.  edit:  HOWEVER it is the end of the schoolyear and a lot of people may have just opened up places, so you may have a better chance this time of year than any other time to find what you're looking for."

Sad thing is there are more haters on ksl then what showed up to protest the parade. I'd like to point out that there were two massive lds organizations who marched in the parade supporting LGBT people and that was refreshing.

I usually like doing one of those when going to get ready in the mindset to work somewhere.  I'm close to a Starbucks on 4th south, its fine if I have my headphones in or is totally dead but there can be some annoying people there...And there is way better coffee in town.  Peoples Coffee or whatever its called on 3rd south is pretty cool not a lot of room there.  I'm close to that starbucks and the avenues on 1st coffeeshop. It has plenty of room, is always hot AF in there and coffee isn't great...but for some reason I get a lot of work done in these cases or sitting out on the crappy lawn chairs and making calls.  Some other cool places would be Salt Lake Roasting Co. Tons of room so you know you can get a table. Not sure how their wifi is, usually when I go there i'm meeting someone as I pick one of the other places on the list to walk or bike instead.  If you are going to have to consistently pay for that. I would find a cowork space. Tons in town. I would do research on where you live whats near, price range, desk availability, hours open and what times you like to work.   I am a night owl, work with my team in the Philippines from 5pm to like 4 am at times so usually do bulk of my work at home and do the fun writing, and creative projects I work on at coffee shops in the afternoons in bursts of 2 to 3 hours.  Good luck on the co-working spaces there's some really cool ones in town. Would love to hear where you pick and why though as I only have met and toured through a few here so far."

SaltLakeCity,38yv9g,jortr0n,3,Mon Jun 8 04:48:35 2015 UTC,"Well imo gun control isn't THAT important compared to other topics   To you, maybe not. But to others, it is a big deal.   this is why he will fail in utah   I certainly don't think this alone would be the cause, but it's one of the few things that the majority of Utah can often agree on both sides of the political spectrum. Utah is interesting that way. So it would definitely be a factor, but it's hard enough to convince Utah to vote Blue already, Bernie will probably not make that any easier for those who are very Red leaning or on the edge for specific reasons.   why the fuck do so many care about guns that much? It's mind boggling how much people care about it.   Probably something to do with the 2A, people tend to be protective of their rights.   I used to make silencers and never understood it. Guns are fun ....yes I agree, but a sway in vote? Are you fucking kidding me?   Then you of all people should know how much fuckery goes in when ridiculous gun laws are passed.. the fact you have to get a $200 tax stamp for suppressors is a great example. Suppressors are often easier to get in other countries with far stricter gun control laws because they see the utility in them.  The problem is gun control trolls (The Dianne Feinsteins who will constantly chisel away at anything they can for no particular reason. Ex: ""pistol grips"", ""barrel shrouds"", ""retractable stocks"") and anyone else who don't know enough about firearms so will just agree to make them illegal because they're black and scary.   It's important to find out if a candidate falls in either one of these, because you often don't generally see it until they get voted in which is bullshit. 1 bad candidate can really cause a lot of pointless damage solely due to ignorance which is terrifying. Technology laws in general (obviously the internet in specific) also fall under this same category IMO."

At least in Utah, the divide isn't nearly white and black anymore.  You're right though, there are definitely bigger issues to worry about, but that doesn't give Bernie a free pass to just ignore the issue. If it's not a big issue that he should worry about, then he shouldn't have any problem giving his straight opinion."

I wouldn't call it's reputation overblown.  I think that if you want ""nice"", your best bet is either to head far West to suburb land or maybe go for a newer gated community.  If you're feeling adventurous, maybe do give WVC a try. It's a helluva lot more diverse and cheaper than where I live now (Holladay). Great Vietnamese food, good thai food.

SaltLakeCity,38ogfq,HotKarl_Marx,3,Fri Jun 5 21:38:45 2015 UTC,"They do seem to be getting closer and closer to being the same. I have a memory of when I was very young and my family was merging onto a tollway in Tehran. The tollway had been built by the church and so the toll to drive on it was to have your car searched and purged of all things non religious. We had to quickly hide the cassette tapes under the seat while the police did a cursory search of the car and tossed some magazines and the tape in the deck into a trash trailer there by the road. I had this strange memory of that while trying to explain to one of my mormon friend's the problems that can arise when the church starts buying streets and enforcing church rules like ""no smoking"" and ""no gay people holding hands"" on this street. It is a very slippery slope when we start allowing churches to annex public property, like the LDS church has in parts of Salt Lake. I will never forget the change of perspective that gave my friend on that day. I think of all places in America, Salt Lake has most reminded me of Tehran, and I will say that isn't a big positive statement for Salt Lake."

SaltLakeCity,38pbte,SenorKerry,2,Fri Jun 5 19:15:29 2015 UTC,I heard it was for contract reasons but I googled it and found this Facebook post from Dec. 2013.   we don't currently offer FrontRunner service on Sundays due to a limited budget and low projected ridership. The majority of FrontRunner riders are students and commuters. We hope to expand service as ridership increases and our budget allows.   That doesn't sound very promising.

SaltLakeCity,38otxw,mountain__pew,6,Fri Jun 5 16:48:25 2015 UTC,"I cycle to work, and have mixed feelings about this.   Urban planners seem to think that by putting bike lanes (forcing bike traffic onto low-traffic streets) and creating dedicated bike trails, that will make bike commuting more desirable and accessible. This might get novice cyclists to feel more comfortable in the short term, but for the majority of people who already know how to bike in traffic it is like using a band-aid on a broken leg.  The reality is: people start bike-commuting when it's safer and faster to bike everywhere. No commuter wants to go on a 2 mile detour just to use a dedicated bike lane or path. We want to be able to take direct routes, use well-maintained roads, and bike on busy streets without getting run over.   Rather than focusing on protected bike lanes and specialized bike intersections, the best things they could do would be:   install traffic lights that detect and prioritize cyclists remove all speed bumps fix potholes and other hazards in a timely manner fix roads to make sure shoulders and bike lanes don't narrow or end abruptly (this can usually be solved with paint!) ensure shoulders are paved smoothly and free of debris, even when there no painted bike lanes make it safer for cyclists to use busy intersections and cross freeways while on the road (e.g., 13th E crossing I-80) place bus stops in places that are wide enough to allow bike traffic to pass safely to the left, and require buses to yield to cyclists when pulling out of stops create education campaigns that encourage motorists to watch out for cyclists, and provide incentives to start cycling themselves   This needs to be valley-wide, not just in downtown SLC."
SaltLakeCity,38otxw,ajfa,2,Fri Jun 5 21:10:06 2015 UTC,"This needs to be valley-wide, not just in downtown SLC.   Good luck with that."
SaltLakeCity,38otxw,HatuutaH,2,Sat Jun 6 00:00:09 2015 UTC,"Well, funny you mention that.   Let's take 13th E as an example.   I was cycling around Dimple Dell Rd and 13th E in south Sandy and noticed bike lanes up and down 13th E, between 106th and 9400 S. It was great. Tons of recreational cyclists, very nice place to ride.   Now if you get close to Ft Union, these lanes end abruptly, as if a planner thought ""oh boy, traffic is dense here, better get rid of bike lanes."" That's a disaster waiting to happen.   This is not just a south valley problem, it's even worse along 13th E in Sugarhouse. Every day a long line of cars sits at the light at 13th E and 21st south, trying to get to the freeway. The road is not huge, but it's easily wide enough for a bike lane. Instead, there's no bike lane, not even a painted shoulder, and cars muscle cyclists into a deep ditch so they can get a better view of the traffic light.   Ironically, some of the best stretches of road in Utah are 13th E through Millcreek -- not exactly posh and no bike lanes at all, but wide shoulders and well maintained road.   Sandy City putting in bike lanes doesn't exactly make headlines, but it's only 13 miles from Sandy to the U along 13th E -- not exactly an impossible distance to commute."

I'm sure you weren't aware of every ROE for the past 10+ years for both Iraq and Afghanistan.  My meaning of ""pretty much"" is this. If it's night and you are taking fire and you can see the muzzle flash, you can shoot AT the muzzle flash. If someone takes some pop shots at you AND THEN STOPS, even though you saw the muzzle flash you CANNOT shoot back. Yes, this is exactly what we were told. I remember it because every time we went out on patrol we had to go over ROE's and EOF's. Every damn time. Mounted patrol's had slightly different ROE's and EOF's. Someone had to pose an Imminent threat, not a possible threat.   Guy standing on top of a mountain with a cell phone. Guy standing next a culvert. Guy with a rifle on his back.   Again, perhaps in the beginning. A guy on top of a hill or house (no mountains where I was) was just a guy on a cell phone. Keep an eye on him, maybe go question him, sure. Shooting someone trying to make a phone call with shitty reception, Court Martial. Guy standing next to a culvert, is just a guy. Suspicious yes, a confirmed threat, no.   Perhaps in the initial surge it was acceptable to kill anyone doing something suspicious. I don't know when you were in Afghanistan but when I was in Iraq (2006 and 2007-2008) from the Regimental Commander down to the platoon Sergeant everyone was told, ""Just because someone has an AK on their back doesn't mean you can shoot them. Everyone has an AK out here.""   Except there was a threat present.   Police responded to a 911 call about a man ""waving a gun around,"" according to Sgt. Darin Sweeten from the South Salt Lake Police Department.  Brandishing a weapon is a threatening situation. Let me tell you a little story about when I was brandishing a weapon and had the cops called on me.  I was a young teen at the time. (End of 2001 start of 2002, a scary time for America.) My friends and I were really into airsoft (guns that look astonishingly real but fire plastic BB's). My friends had played a prank on me a few days earlier by shooting me with airsoft handguns as soon as I got out of my car. So I thought I would get them back. A few days later I was hiding out behind a bush waiting for them to show up so I could rain plastic hell on them. Unfortunately a neighbor lady drove by in her van and saw me hiding (with my hoodie on) and what appeared to be a gun sticking out of my hoodie pocket with my hand on it. My friends were taking too long to come home so I just went inside and waited for them there. I had gaming to get to. Now the cops show up.   Imagine the situation they are walking into. Imagine the hysterical (not haha) call they get of a teenager with a gun crouching outside of a house. Oh my god now the kid with a gun is walking into someones house!  The two officers show up at the house, ring the bell, talk to me, talk to my friends mom, inspect every airsoft weapon we have in the house. (There were many at this point, a mix of handguns, SMG's, rifles, shotguns and sniper rifles.)   These two officers assessed the situation, talked to everyone involved, got the NON-adrenalized facts about the situation and nobody was shot.  People can be stupid, People get depressed, People hear everything that is going on in the media and over dramatize it and over personalize it. People say stupid shit all the time.   Because when someone tells you that you are going to grill steaks you don't show up with a microwave.   I don't even.... this was a 7-11 with someone that was brandishing a weapon not the Titty Twister   Not murder   He was killed by another human on purpose.  After watching the video again, if the officer didn't know who had the gun why did he pass up two suspects leaving him totally exposed to get shot or stabbed in the back? Also, I thought officers were trained in basic life saving techniques? He didn't even attempt to apply pressure.  tldr; I, as a Marine, as well as the Marine's I was deployed with, treated ""possible Iraqi terrorists""(military aged males) with more human respect and decency than this officer did with Dillon Taylor.  Edit: Add - Imminent threat"

I'm sure you weren't aware of every ROE for the past 10+ years for both Iraq and Afghanistan.   Yes, I was ware of them. So no, if you were told that, ever, it was not correct. It was likely that your leadership just didn't trust you to make decisions.    My meaning of ""pretty much"" is this.

SaltLakeCity,38mgt1,Phiasmir,5,Fri Jun 5 16:13:18 2015 UTC,"A few years ago, went shooting up at the bountiful range with my brothers. Another driver crashed in to us en route. My brother exiting the car... wearing a .45 openly strapped to his chest and a 9mm on his side. (And two more concealed, but legal as a concealed carry permit holder.)  Other driver panicked when he saw, but still stuck around since another passenger (also concealed carry) had called 911 while in the car and already told the other driver police were en route.  The one on the phone repeatedly told dispatch on the situation and asked for verification that they clearly told officers there were open carry and concealed carry at the site and that they were on the way to the gun range, not to panic.   When officers arrived the first asked my brother to remove the firearms. My brother carefully responded that we were on the way to the gun range, and that most of us in the vehicle had concealed carry permits and were carrying; there was no need to remove the (unloaded) visible weapons.  Even so, four police cars arrived and most of them were freaked out at the idea of someone openly carrying a firearm even though we were on the way to the pistol range.    It isn't just the common folk who freak out about seeing a weapon. Cops freak out about it too even when they are properly and legally carried.  I wish more people would openly carry and educate the population, this could help desensitize people about seeing others exercising their rights."

He responded to a call where someone was brandishing a weapon, suspect tried to leave, ignored orders, turned around, and while facing a drawn gun, decided to reach into his pants. Cop was extremely reasonable to consider his life in danger. Terrible outcome caused by this kid's stupid decisions. Wouldn't be surprised if it was cop assisted suicide, seeing the other information about this kid."
SaltLakeCity,38mgt1,nicotron,7,Fri Jun 5 20:16:11 2015 UTC,"Ummm, that is some serious speculation there. Suicide by cop? And also, ""kid's stupid decision"" is exactly what we are talking about. You shouldn't get murdered over a bad decision. They can be on the ready with their guns if needs be, but showing up, before you even see a weapon ,with guns drawn and pointed shouldn't be standard procedure. You aren't de-escalating anything that way.   Reaching for something shouldn't get you killed either. Who knows how you would react with guns pointed at you? From personal experience, your brain goes out the window.  As long as we are wildly speculating about his mindset, let me share a true story with you.  When I was younger, I was involved in a very similar situation. My friends and I walked to the store at about midnight to get some food, and there just happened to be a robbery nearby.  I came outside to about 10 cops with guns drawn, pointed at my friends at I. I totally froze. They were all yelling at me to drop my donuts and OJ. It took me about 15-20 seconds of confused disbelief for me to finally put them down and raise my hands. We were wearing hooded sweatshirts, which was what the suspect was also wearing. After being treated pretty roughly, cuffed, beat up a little, and thrown in a squad car, we were let go because they tracked down the real criminal. I asked for a badge #, the cop said to me, ""Just be glad you aren't going to jail, now get out of here.""   So what if I got shot during this exchange? Would the excuse be, well, he didn't drop the bag and we didn't know what was in it? It could have been a weapon? I could have easily have gone for my ID, because that's what cops usually want and got shot because I was scared, and not thinking straight.  This cop in question should lose his badge, and at the very least be charged with manslaughter. He fucking shot an unarmed person, wearing headphones. But nope. He's a cop, and will get off, just like all the other murdering cops."
SaltLakeCity,38mgt1,gwar37,-2,Fri Jun 5 20:41:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think his stupid decision should carry a punishment of death. I'm saying his stupid decision caused his death. Just like running across train tracks at the last moment is a stupid decision... one that doesn't deserve death, but one that can cause it.   We can argue about standard procedure another day. I think drawing your weapon on a supposedly armed suspect who isn't obeying your orders makes a lot of sense. This procedure is safer for the cop but does increase the likelihood of shit going awry, especially when dealing with kids like this. Things could have been better on both sides but that is always the case. Nothing ever goes perfectly. And looking back makes it very easy for us to nitpick. The people that are saying this cop is a murderer who deserves hell are delusional (and sadistic).  Your story is an unfortunate one. I find it hard to believe it took you 20 seconds to stare around and realize you need to put your hands up. I don't think you would have been dumb enough to start walking away and then reach for your waist."
SaltLakeCity,38mgt1,nicotron,2,Fri Jun 5 20:52:03 2015 UTC,"But what was he suspected of? Having a gun? As far as I know, that is not illegal. He was not threatening anyone... so what crime was committed? He was shot because the cop was scared."
SaltLakeCity,38mgt1,cracker_nut,0,Fri Jun 5 22:13:23 2015 UTC,"I was 18 and dumb, but not dumb enough to reach for my waist. I wasn't going anywhere. I was frozen like a deer in headlights...headlights that shot bullets. It did take me a long time to respond to their commands. You really can't know how you would react until it happens.   My real point is that I think this whole situation could have easily been avoided with a few extra steps before showing up guns drawn, and ready."

We start playing the what-if game.   I think ""don't run away from cops or refuse orders and reach into your pants"" is kind of like a ""coffee is hot"" disclaimer. But I guess some people need it."
SaltLakeCity,38mgt1,nicotron,27,Fri Jun 5 21:09:01 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll play devils advocate. This guy matches the description, they tell him to turn around and put his hands up and he ignores them, but then when he does turn around he refuses to put his hands up and instead reaches into his pants. Ignore for a second that we now know he was totally unarmed, at the time its impossible to know that and it looks very much like he could be reaching for a weapon.  That aside I really am baffled by this. I mean officer 2 has a gun drawn, why can't officer one go at him with a tazer, even firing a little premature? If he did pull out a weapon, officer 2 is at the ready to take action. Sure it sucks to get tazed , but that's a lot better than a 9mm to the chest.   I kinda get it, the officer doesn't want to get shot, but at the same time why are all our offices choosing lethal option first?"

SaltLakeCity,38mgt1,oussan,9,Fri Jun 5 07:03:33 2015 UTC,This scenario (frightened cowardly callers terrified of anyone walking around) has played out numerous times lately. The problem is that Law Enforcers arrive and fail to find out what's really going on. It's like the only skill they have is to draw their weapons. Then citizens either comply or die.
SaltLakeCity,38mgt1,neil801,3,Fri Jun 5 14:34:05 2015 UTC,"I agree the situation isn't as clear cut as some would have you believe. The headphones are difficult to spot and it is easy to see why the officers saw the possibility of him haveing a gun. That said, It's so premature, with two officers already having their guns aimed and ready at the suspect, surely there should be the burden of actually seeing a gun before firing. How unlikely is it that the suspect could draw the gun, aim and shoot before one of officers took him down?"
SaltLakeCity,38mgt1,Democracy-Manifest,14,Fri Jun 5 14:03:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I watched the video when it was first released as well, and it definitely looks like his hands make a ""draw gun"" motion. Now, he may have just been reaching for his mp3 player, but it doesn't look like it.   Combine that with the cops getting sent on the call, being told the suspect had a gun and was threatening. The police were told they were going into a ""guns out"" situation, and everything the guy does appears to agree with that assessment.   It's a shitty combination of factors leading to a horrible misunderstanding, but I can see why it happened."

SaltLakeCity,38mgt1,gthing,7,Fri Jun 5 05:41:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, but if anyone were ever feeling in danger of the fact that I'm carrying a gun, I'd have no problem speaking with any officers. If there's nothing illegal, there's nothing to worry about. Blatantly walking away from the cops and looking as though he was reaching for a weapon was a bad decision that led to a bad situation for all involved.   And the sword incident, sure it's not illegal to have a sword, but when being told to stop and instead running toward a business full of people, the cops would be shamed by the community if they did nothing and someone died at the hands of the man carrying the sword.  But in broad terms, you're correct: carrying firearms and swords doesn't automatically mean there is anything illegal going on."

A witness claimed three men were flashing a gun in the area. Cruz was in the area and arrived first. He spotted the three men based on the witness description and observed their actions. As they went into a 7-Eleven, 2102 S. State, he called for backup and waited for the trio to walk out, believing that at least one of them was armed, Gill said. The body camera video from Cruz shows that as he drove his car into the 7-Eleven parking lot, two of the men — Taylor's brother and cousin — immediately stop and put their hands in the air. Taylor holds his head down and keeps walking. Believing that he had a gun, Cruz follows Taylor with his own gun now drawn. Another officer approaches from the other end of the parking lot.

South Salt Lake police Sgt. Darin Sweeten said Dillon Taylor, who allegedly had gang affiliations according to court documents  Taylor was facing a $25,000 arrest warrant for allegedly violating probation he received for robbery and obstructing justice; he was arrested July 31 in North Salt Lake for being drunk and interfering with the arresting officer, according to an affidavit filed with the court.  Taylor also had failed to maintain full employment, complete a mental health evaluation or complete a substance abuse evaluation, all conditions of his probation, according to the affidavit.  Taylor expressed an intense feeling of doom, and determination not to go back to jail as a result of the warrant, issued Aug. 7.  ""I feel my time is coming soon, my nightmears [sic] are telling me,"" he wrote that day on Facebook. ""ALL my family has turned and snitched on me. I'll die before I go do a lot of time in a cell. I'm trying to strive and live but [I'm] done litrerly [can't] stand breathing and dealing with s—-. I feel like god [can't] even save me on this one. ... this time [it's] me and the demons [I'm] fighting.""  Third District Court records show that Taylor pleaded guilty to a reduced count of second-degree felony robbery in connection to thefts at a Beto's restaurant and another 7-Eleven in South Salt Lake in May of 2012. Taylor's co-defendant grabbed the tip jar at Beto's, according to court documents. About an hour later, Taylor's co-defendant stole a case of beer at a 7-Eleven at 2700 S. Adams St. (450 East). When the clerk followed him to a car, Taylor placed a hand into his waistband and told the man, ""Don't be a hero ... or I'll ... shoot you,"" according to court documents.  In an unrelated obstructing justice case in August 2012, Taylor threatened a co-defendant in the robbery case, as well as his wife and daughter, and called the co-defendant ""a ... snitch,"" according to court documents."

SaltLakeCity,38mgt1,maurosmane,5,Fri Jun 5 16:15:24 2015 UTC,I can absolutely understand the point of view that the officers were justified. Here's the thing though: they killed a human being based on a misunderstanding.  He behaved poorly given the situation. It was stupid to stick his hands down his pants like that then whip them out. It was stupid to ignore an officer's instructions/orders.   Stupidity and poor behavior are NOT capital offenses. The burden is on the officer in this situation to ensure he does the right thing and he didn't pure and simple. There was no justifiable reason too pull that trigger without trying something else first.

No, stupid behavior like walking away from police and reaching into your empty waistband is not a capital offense. It's not like he went to trial and we are giving him the electric chair for reaching into his empty pants. His stupid decision FORCED the cop to react quickly in defense of his own life. And that is why he's dead. It's not the situation anyone wanted but it's the situation he created. The cop was responding to suspicious individual brandishing a weapon who then walked away from him and THEN reached into his pants. I would have had my gun drawn as well. If we could bring him back and throw his stupid ass into jail for a few months, we would. But we can't."

The officer CAME UP BEHIND Taylor and his friends, and Taylor had headphones in his ears and never responded to the yell.  Taylor did not look up, did not look around, kept walking and pulled up his sagging drawers.  It is fairly clear Taylor did not hear it.  Watch the videos now that they're released. This was not a case of fleeing, it was an officer walking up from behind, and the man kept walking he was shot.

You're scared, thinking what am I walking in to here? This could be anywhere on the spectrum.  It's probably a good idea to have my weapon drawn just in case this guy gets nasty.  You walk up to him and tell him to raise his hands... and he responds ""No"" AND reaches down to his waistband.  You're telling me you would have asked again nicely?  It's a very unfortunate situation, no doubt."

You are right, his life was potentially on the line. So, when it turns out that he shot an unarmed kid, it completely is justifiable because someone calls police and claims that someone is waving a gun (no weapon was ever found, on Taylor, or the other two)?? That's like saying that if I lived next door to you, and called police telling them you were waving a gun around in your yard before going back into your house, that they would be ok to shoot you if you didn't follow orders, and kill you. On the spot. This isn't a fucking joke. It's death. Taylor can't come back from that officers decisions. He didn't deserve to die. It's wrong that our officers employ a shoot first mentality. There are a number of other ways to go about this situation other than jumping out of your patrol car with your weapon drawn. I think we can all agree on that, seeing as how this kid was unarmed."

SaltLakeCity,38or8h,Blindpassion54,2,Fri Jun 5 16:31:26 2015 UTC,"Architect here.  The advantage of a whole house fan is that, at night you can use it, combined with open windows, to purge the house of heat using the cool night time air.  Then, in the morning, close the windows and turn the fan off.  This is referred to a diurnal cooling and is an old technique that is still used in homes and buildings designed to not rely on mechanical forms of cooling (ie. air conditioning).  If you already have the shaft then you will need to get a fan and a good damper to seal off the shaft during the hot time of the day or during the winter.  I would definitely explore the option."
SaltLakeCity,38or8h,ratherride,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:31:27 2015 UTC,This is exactly right.  My first home had a whole house fan / attic fan. It was wonderful when things cooled down in the summer evenings and you could just turn that fan on and suck all of the hot air out of the house.  We had a very old central AC unit and the fan definitely help us reduce our dependence on it.
SaltLakeCity,38or8h,bpeters07,2,Sat Jun 6 01:59:48 2015 UTC,"Can't you run your central air fan without the A/C unit on? Every central air equipped home I've ever been in can do this. Part of the reason I installed a Nest thermostat was to have automation for running that fan alone when it's not really hot/cold enough to trigger the A/C or furnace, to keep the temperature even and clear the air.  TL;DR you probably already have a ""whole house fan"" as part of your central air system."

SaltLakeCity,38lzrk,Sevrdhed,11,Fri Jun 5 02:15:33 2015 UTC,"I think there are a variety of reasons...    the prison will likely lower the property values of the surrounding area. Once you have the prison you can't get rid of it if your city wants to expand into the area it occupies. its a great huge ugly complex of buildings, guard towers, and razor wires 'besmirching' the beauty of your lovely little town. the idea of some violent felon getting loose and you're the closest place for him to 'acquire' resources to continue his escape.   The process is further complicated by the needs of the prison. You have to have a prison near SLC for access to major medical and the federal courts; otherwise I think we would just expand the Central Utah Prison (which is kind of out in the middle of nowhere) or build the new prison out in the middle of nowhere as well. I suspect that it will eventually end up somewhere that is already kind of permanently screwed for property values anyway, like just north of the SLC international airport under the flight paths.   The Utah legislature sweetened the pot a bit this year, passing a law that would let whatever city takes the prison raise their sales tax by 0.25%. This isn't much of an incentive to smaller cities and towns that don't have a lot of businesses in their tax area (in fact it hurts them since it hurts their relatively sparse and thus precious businesses) but it sure made SLC change their tune."

If you own a house next to some land zoned for residential or commercial development, then out of nowhere the government decides that's where the new prison is going to go...are you going to be happy about that? Whether there's a safety issue or not is besides the point...a prison reduces the value of surrounding land. Why do you think Draper wants so bad to pawn it off on another community so that they can build more business parks and housing?   Then you add in the big question of why we are even building a new prison, and whether it is actually necessary to move it at all. It's very likely that this is just a scheme to line developer pockets, which is an issue that is majorly being overlooked because of this fabricated controversy with the location.

SaltLakeCity,38lzrk,noodlz05,-1,Fri Jun 5 20:36:51 2015 UTC,"One reason we need a new prison is the model that designed Draper is 50 years old. It's true that some buildings are falling apart, mainly Wasatch, but even the ones that have 20+ years left make reform difficult.  Draper was designed to first warehouse and second teach inmates accountability.  And while those things are important there might be a better way. With HB 348 the new model will be transitioning inmates to live pro social lives upon release. The bones of Draper make this pretty much impossible.  We know that the bones make up a huge reason we lack quality programming we see today.  This prison move may have begun with the intent to line pockets, and it still may be there. But reform has jumped on board and a new prison can bring a lot of opportunity to reforming the entire criminal justice system for the State."
SaltLakeCity,38lzrk,Mr_Fffish,2,Sat Jun 6 21:09:46 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem I have is that there is more than enough land at the current site to satisfy their needs (its actually larger than some of the new plots of land they're looking at)...so why can't they use the some ~20% of unused land to do a phased build of the new prison, kind of like how the airport is approaching things?   The main reason is probably because of the potential for economic development of the site, which is fine...but then why move it to a location which is surely going to run into the same issue 10-20 years from now as the area continues to expand?"

I was told ""No business is going to build an office overlooking Orange is the New Black"".

SaltLakeCity,38jva4,Chemspiration,-5,Thu Jun 4 21:27:57 2015 UTC,You do realize the majority of pollution in the valley comes from private citizens and not industry right?
SaltLakeCity,38jva4,DeadSeaGulls,7,Thu Jun 4 22:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. You might be thinking of recent campaigning to try and ban wood burning stoves that presented data in a selective manner.  Top individual polluters are by far industry. Kennecott and their refining plant hold top two spots.  Green works or whatever is third.  But yeah, cars altogether probably account for the top spot, but You have to remember when they point to the types of pollution found in car exhaust and wood burning, those same particles are also found in industrial pollution.  It's not as clean cut as they try to suggest.    The way I see it is we can hold industry actually accountable (not this 15 year goal promise shit) and see MASSIVE CHANGE, or we can really really hope over 1 million people all do their tiny drop in the bucket part and drive a little less so that we can see slight change."
SaltLakeCity,38jva4,dmarie229,3,Thu Jun 4 23:55:58 2015 UTC,"Tier 3 emissions and gasoline standards will be phased in starting 2017 to nationally address the pollution from the automobile industry (which in Utah I believe accounts for 51% of emissions).  In addition though, I would love to see CCS on current operating plants and a fuck ton more solar panels on commercial property."
SaltLakeCity,38jva4,Chemspiration,0,Fri Jun 5 00:18:27 2015 UTC,"Those are factually inaccurate statements according to the university of utah. at least with regard to air pollution.  The problem here isnt industry and to pretend policing them more than we do now will result in some widespread increase in air quality is bogus and honestly a fantasy all the commuters would love to dream about all day.  As for water pollution, runoff from cities is predominantly the source of the majority of continuing pollution. Left over pollution from the past lax industrial standards persists as well, but current contributions from industry are much less than what rain washes into watersheds.  What you are saying is why not do the easy thing and run industry out of town. Thats not a solution to anything. How about imposing a toll on all one person per car interstate drivers going more than 20 miles one way excepting trucks and weekends? That would put a serious dent in air pollution and promote carpooling like nobodies business. I realize no one would ever go for this but to sit back and blame a very small contributor to overall pollution is pointless."
SaltLakeCity,38jva4,DeadSeaGulls,2,Fri Jun 5 00:27:26 2015 UTC,The U of U study is exactly what I'm talking about.  Not an objective interpretation of data.
SaltLakeCity,38jva4,Chemspiration,2,Fri Jun 5 00:31:32 2015 UTC,How so?
SaltLakeCity,38jva4,DeadSeaGulls,3,Fri Jun 5 00:33:35 2015 UTC,"The study looks at the pm2.5 content of the air over a relatively short period of time, sees a specific type of particle known to come from wood burning, and attributes an origin to those particles to wood burning stoves and fireplaces. That claim of origin isn't backed, and frankly, lies outside of the scope of this study.  They don't account for natural burns that may have occurred during the coarse of the study, wood burnt by business and industry, or pm2.5 content that is blown into the valley from outside sources. This of course applies to exhaust the same (minus natural sources).   This study was released in conjunction with campaigning by the division of air quality to ban wood burning stoves without any necessary ground work or research regarding the publics actual use of stoves. It came out of nowhere which is why there was such outrage and why the ban was thrown out upon public hearing.   Holding industry accountable to real standards and regulations won't push them out of the valley (though I do think we should incentivize industry and worker moves to in-state areas not prone to inversion).  Right now they are running nearly unchecked... This isn't happening in most of the country. While burning and exhaust account for a lot of the visual pollution, the heavy duty cancer causing pollution is HEAVILY industry caused. Kennecott and such are getting off on a series of 5, 10, and 15 year promises that are each pushed back in turn for new promises when goals aren't meant come deadline with no real consequence.  Citizens need to do their part for sure and we need to work to cut citizen caused pollution (I have a hundred suggestions for that as well) but we can't write industry a blank check to poison our future and expect homeowners to shoulder the burden of our states air quality alone.   What ever happened to power to the people?"
SaltLakeCity,38jva4,Chemspiration,2,Fri Jun 5 01:02:09 2015 UTC,Ill have to look more into that. You make some interesting points.   As for power to the people. That ended when people stopped paying attention to their government. Now all one has to do is sway old religious idiots into liking you because god and you become an elected official.

It's a fraction of the cost and, as long as it's seasoned properly, you should be good to go.  Pressure cooking will increase the tenderness of the meat more than normal oven roasting or slow cooking will, and the fat marbling, though less in quantity, is similar in pattern to Wagyu.

SaltLakeCity,38ljae,Bwall19,3,Fri Jun 5 00:14:11 2015 UTC,"Will you be living on/near base? Hill AFB is in Davis Co, and is a significantly more conservative culture than in SLC. Downtown is roughly 30-40 minutes from the base. There are a handful of bars near Hill field (I can think of 2 right off) but not much of a nightlife. Also, Davis County has a much higher proportion of Mormons than SLC.   That said, I lived near Hill for a few years and actually liked it, but heading into SLC got tiresome.   SLC, on the other hand, would probably  be much more to your liking from your description. I know I like it more than Davis Co, both for cultural and convenience reasons.   Edit: booze laws aren't really that bad, just weird. 3.2 beer in the grocery, real beer/wine/liquor at the state liquor store. Most everything else is pretty similar to everywhere else I've lived, except no kegs.

SaltLakeCity,38ljae,varthalon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:53:52 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Utah!  Don't worry about the Mormons. They don't bite. A few can be obnoxious trying to convert you or being 'holier-than-thou' but by far the majority are very nice.  Sundays will be your biggest culture shock but may actually be your funnest day. No alcohol sales on Sunday so you have to plan ahead for that (the Bx may have different rules through, I don't know). Most businesses are closed Sundays as well but the benefit is the ones that stay open are almost empty... which means more for you. For example: you want to see a movie without the theater being crowded with kids... Sunday matinee is your thing, you can have a whole row of seats for yourself (I've even had an entire showing to myself on a couple of occasions).  Outdoors recreation can't be beat. plenty of biking, hiking, camping, and national parks within a couple hours drive. Great skiing (although expensive) in the winter.   College scene can be a mixed bag. In general it is much more sedate than other places I've been but then you get the kids trying to make up for it that are wilder than any other place I've seen.  Nightlife... fewer bars and clubs but they do exist. Other than maybe having a longer trip to get to one you like, or not having as wide a variety to chose from, you can still easily find a couple to your liking to patronize. Especially when your coming to/from Hill you can easily link up with other airmen with like interests to go as a group to have fund with."
SaltLakeCity,38jddi,VatoUT99,8,Thu Jun 4 16:41:41 2015 UTC,"Moved from the East Coast for the same reason last year. I recommend Central City and anywhere on the University Trax line. 9th and 9th is cool. Don't move to sugar house unless you want to drive everywhere. Maybe you do, but I've found Salt Lake surprisingly bikable and walkable."
SaltLakeCity,38jddi,mr_everything,3,Thu Jun 4 18:13:18 2015 UTC,sugarhouse. I don't live there but I moved here from the East Coast and if I was in my 20's that's where I would live. I am in my 30's so I prefer the avenues/Capitol hill.
SaltLakeCity,38jddi,SenorKerry,3,Thu Jun 4 16:46:37 2015 UTC,"The only downside with Sugarhouse is that it is now way, way overpriced.   For the prices you pay there, you can often live in the Avenues or 9th and 9th, which are both closer to the university and a lot more fun."
SaltLakeCity,38jddi,ajfa,2,Thu Jun 4 16:57:48 2015 UTC,Price is relative. I traded my 500 sq.ft condo in Boston for a cheaper single family home in Capitol Hill. Funny thing is my house in Capitol Hill was cheaper than my rental in the Aves or my friend's house at 9th and 9th. I like 9th and 9th too but it really is more young families than bar hopping 20-somethings. The question to OP is do you want life to exist right outside your door or do you want to drive to life?

I mean, assuming the house was in the sort of condition you'd expect, I'd pay $260,000 for that no problem (assuming I was in the position to buy a house right now). Who cares if it's small its prime real estate."
SaltLakeCity,38jddi,Deforesting,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:17:39 2015 UTC,"I really like the 9th and 9th area. If I were your age I'd move there, not Sugarhouse.   I'd recommend the lower Avenues. Because of the herd moving to Sugarhouse it's now actually cheaper to live there!  Finally, if you're willing to drive 10-15 minutes to work, you can get some really good deals in Millcreek."

I know lots of people suggested Sugarhouse but I think Downtown is perfect for biking and public transportation so it gets the upper hand. Sugarhouse does have lots of bars and restaurants but if you work downtown, its about the same price to live close by."
SaltLakeCity,38jddi,waffles420,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"I also grew up on the east coast (PA) and worked for the U about 4 years ago. The east side of the valley is greenest and in the Sugarhouse or Holladay area I sometimes forget I'm in Utah and feel back at home. The rest of the SL Valley is pretty dry and bland though.  Parking at the U is a bitch, even for faculty/staff. Walking/biking is great in the summer but you'll certainly want to take Trax or the bus come winter. The U is up on the bench so it gets hammered with snow pretty hard compared to the rest of SLC. I hate the cold so this is important to me but some people won't care. Sugarhouse may be pricier than elsewhere but it's right between downtown and the U which is where I'd want to be if I were in your shoes.  If you want some place more spread-out-suburban where you drive everywhere, check out Draper. I'll probably get downvotes for this but I'd recommend staying away from housing on the west side of I15 or north of downtown SLC. At least until you get more comfortable with the area.  Best of luck!"

Ft Union is awesome, you get a lot of bang for your buck there. You're so close to BCC/LCC that you can be at the resorts in 20 minutes. Downtown is 15 minutes away when there's no traffic. Sure you need to own a car, but you'll need that in Sugarhouse too for twice the price per sq ft. There's Trader Joe's, The Pie, Sunset Coffee, Bohemian Brewery. Maybe 10 years ago it was all buttoned-up families going to the ward, now it's more like tattooed 20-somethings going to play D&D."

Anecdotally, on my street near Flat Iron Mesa, only one of my 8 immediate neighbors is LDS.   Still not sure where all the hate for south valley comes from.

What large, tightly organized groups don't have most members ""toe the party line"" even if they dissent when it comes down to it? There is always some infighting if you look close enough. Even Mormons have Ordain Women and a whole list of sects that have broken off from Joseph Smith's time to today.  This argument doesn't apply only to Mormons. If you ever find yourself thinking ""they're all the same"" about any group - you're wrong. It's just a convenient train of thought for someone to stereotype and hate en masse instead of treating people like individuals. Holding beliefs like this speaks more to your character than to theirs."

The article states:  ""Authorities said heroin addiction is fueling a rise in violent crime in northern Utah, especially in robberies."" Also noted is that violent crime does not have to have a gun involved.  Also noted is the article says we are still 8th lowest state in crime. How much did violent crime rise?  A fraction of a percent?  Now if you can produce a document telling us that registered gun owners or those with concealed weapon permits are the ones committing the crimes you have  a real story here.

SaltLakeCity,38dd94,IgnacioLopes,10,Wed Jun 3 15:15:03 2015 UTC,They really need to extend trax or the streetcar north from sugarhouse to the U.  A couple blocks won't do anything.  No one wants to ride a streetcar from sugarhouse to the sketchy area around home depot and bestbuy.
SaltLakeCity,38dd94,slcf00d13,9,Wed Jun 3 16:04:45 2015 UTC,"I don't really think it was designed with the idea of ferrying people from Sugarhouse to bestbuy but rather the other way around. It's so that people coming in from the suburbs to the south and west can hop off TRAX by Bestbuy and take the streetcar into Sugarhouse to shop or eat or whatever  What the actual usage of the system is like, I'm not sure, but that's at least what the planners had in mind. I think it's more in anticipation of future development in Sugarhouse that will turn it into a Saturday afternoon destination for suburbanites that don't want to head downtown."
SaltLakeCity,38dd94,The_Crass-Beagle_Act,9,Wed Jun 3 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"I think you are correct, but it speaks to a larger problem.

It would have been best for it to always have ended at Highland/11th East.  Now whether it can fit on 11th East up to 21st South is another story.  Just going that extra bit from the non-nonsensical ending point it has now to the heart of the New Sugar House will increase ridership for the line and reduce out-of-area traffic significantly.     If I were Elon Musk, I'd fund the street car to run from there up 21st past 13th east running north of Sugar House park, and then head on over to the University either on 23rd or 21st East, meeting up with Foothill Blvd where the roads end up.  The 11th East option that was proposed for the future run is hated by folks on 11th.  Running it up 21st South north of the park would allow for more folks in the north park area and Foothill to ride.  I'm biased, of course.  ;)"

You are misinformed. I'm an ex-mormon but I think it is important to give credit where credit is due. Salt Lake has one of the most progressive programs in the world for dealing with homelessness. We actually give them homes and support to find jobs. It's not that they don't care but giving cash to street peddlers is counterproductive. I used to have a friend who was mentally ill. In the summers I would go to his state provided housing and wake him up and take him to St. Vincents for a free lunch. Then we would go and donate blood for money. Later I would see the same assholes who had just eaten lunch with me and sat next to me giving blood asking me for money on the street.

SaltLakeCity,38drwz,iamkate,3,Wed Jun 3 15:41:00 2015 UTC,"I'm behind the paywall at home ($42 for the paper!).  I'd like to know:  1) Autism frequently correlates to pollution, but it's hard to determine which pollutant or pollutants correlate higher.  Does this study factor out everything but PM2.5?  Or is it unable to do so?    2) What are the length of exposures?  In the Wasatch Front, the situation is very different.  A couple of months a year the pollution builds for a week, then PM2.5 gets above 35 ug/m3, then a storm blows it out.  High pollution days are few, but they do happen.  Does this study compare against a few pollution days vs long term pollution?  In other words, do the Pennsylvania folks get nearly 20 ug/m3 for a year? While Salt Lake is around 5 ug/m3 a year except for those inversion periods in the winter?"
SaltLakeCity,38drwz,helix400,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"I'm also behind the paywall but the abstract provides more insight. Authors used ""A land use regression (LUR) model was used to create person- and time-specific PM2.5 estimates for individual (pre-pregnancy, trimesters one through three, pregnancy, years one and two of life) and cumulative (starting from pre-pregnancy) key developmental time periods.""  Land use regression models are a more rapid approach to estimating air quality/pollution. See http://www.integrated-assessment.eu/guidebook/land_use_regression  This group only measured PM2.5 in areas around Pittsburgh. Seems similar to SLC for at least some periods of the year due to the numerous refineries and steel plants."
SaltLakeCity,38drwz,helix400,2,Wed Jun 3 21:52:23 2015 UTC,"They did a fine job properly estimating PM2.5 rates, but I'm just hoping for more data on the other pollutants.     In other words, which pollutant causes the autism?  Some of them?  All of them?  Just one?  Are their PM2.5s different than ours?  Is there some pollutant that's heavy in these other areas that we don't have?   There's a free paper with similar conclusions here:  http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/123/3/ehp.1408133.alt.pdf.  It sees the same weaknesses in their study.  They couldn't measure other pollutants and thus can't determine if they were responsible.  They could only correlate PM2.5 with autism.  The likeliest answer is that ""pollution tends to be similar, and if there's correlation happening elsewhere, there can be correlation here, whatever the actual root pollutant(s) are.""    The biggest issue though is seeing what happens when people are exposed to to heavier pollution rates for a couple of weeks (Utah's situation), instead of the full year."
SaltLakeCity,38drwz,krutoypotsan,2,Wed Jun 3 22:24:44 2015 UTC,"Dunno if you got to read the whole abstract yet.

Or, visit the collective and learn how to do it yourself.  For the fit, give Plan7 a call. It is expensive, $250. And you may need to change out some parts, stem, cranks, bar, post may all be wrong. A good fit is not cheap, but if your spending a good amount of time on your bike, it's the best money you can spend.   Once you have your fit down, write down all your important fit numbers so you can set up future bikes to your body."

SaltLakeCity,388qnj,LetMePointItOut,4,Tue Jun 2 22:57:36 2015 UTC,"No, instead we can place a huge burden on our educators. The more telling statistic is teacher per pupil ratio. Our students are doing well because of our teachers and in spite of our education policy."

SaltLakeCity,388qnj,GuardianBLKWolf,3,Wed Jun 3 03:08:14 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way: Granite District's yearly budget is over half a billion dollars.  Do you want someone managing a half-billion dollar budget who can't command a $200,000+ salary somewhere else?  In fact, I challenge you to find any half-billion-dollar-per-year organization where the top dogs don't make at least that.  Administer salaries are not a proper thing to gripe about.

Weird. You'd think we would want to spend a little more on our children, since they are so important."
SaltLakeCity,388qnj,shakhaki,13,Tue Jun 2 17:22:54 2015 UTC,Having worked in districts the only ones really affected by poor budgets are the rural areas. Many schools in the valley are funded well and many have 1:1 device initiatives in place. State funding isn't exclusively a speaking point when talking about the quality of an education system. A lot of the families in Utah emphasize education and spend time at home reinforcing the knowledge they learn at school. If you've ever been to California they spend a lot on students but their system is basically garbage outside of the wealthy areas. They just babysit children pretty much.   It's my job to understand education.
SaltLakeCity,388qnj,shakhaki,3,Tue Jun 2 19:35:33 2015 UTC,"That's actually really good to know. I used to live in Denver before I had kids in public school, and my wife was a counselor for a school there. The quality of education the students in Denver received was so much better, interesting and hands on than what we've experienced here in Utah. It's not horrible here or anything, but it could be a lot better and part of me feels like my son would have a much better education had we stayed in Denver. So perhaps I have a bit of a knee-jerk reaction when it came to this article. Again, thanks for the response."
SaltLakeCity,388qnj,shakhaki,4,Tue Jun 2 19:39:04 2015 UTC,I lived in Colorado and they're excellent with schools. I agree with Utah lacking in education as is shown through the surge in charter schools here. I probably won't put my kids in Utah's public education but if you're in west valley Neil Armstrong academy is a great charter.
SaltLakeCity,388qnj,agilla,4,Tue Jun 2 19:44:56 2015 UTC,"My kiddo is in a charter. It's decent. The teachers care, which is more than I ever got growing up and having 40+ kids in a classroom. I guess it's more the fact that I know what is possible with children's education, and it bums me out our kids in Utah aren't getting it."
SaltLakeCity,388qnj,bryanut,2,Tue Jun 2 19:51:47 2015 UTC,"I really think the future is in charter schools. They're typically adjoined to districts, but they choose curriculum and emphasis'. There are ones that focus on music and some that do stem. I love the idea of letting a child choose what is most interesting to them."
SaltLakeCity,388qnj,agilla,7,Wed Jun 3 01:15:19 2015 UTC,"See my post below, but Utah spends a considerable amount of its budget on education compared to most other states."
SaltLakeCity,388qnj,tangytalon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:40:49 2015 UTC,Nice fact. It just shows that Utah's budget might be a bit low in this and other areas.  At least we aren't Wisconsin or Louisiana or Kansas.
SaltLakeCity,388qnj,jortr0n,3,Tue Jun 2 23:19:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, Utah is tied for 2nd highest percentage of state domestic product devoted to educational spending.  Utah has more kids, though, so that spending is spread thin on a per-student basis."

Yet, here we are, not privatizing alcohol sales, even though the republican held (mormon) government are all for capitalism. It just sooo obvious already.

It's been an uphill battle for us for the last 7 years with one kid and now another this last year in his first year of kindergarten.

Getting into charter schools that deal with special needs kids (because our school district kind of sucks at it) requires years-old waitlists. Instead, we got ours into a charter Montesorri school with no waitlist down here and have had a great experience.  And yes, you will have to fight the school district for everything. They try to pressure you into accepting less than you need, but they are obligated to meet your demands for services. It will be exhausting and maddening."

I'm not sure what loop hole the gardens are working with, but it is GLORIOUS! For example, last year at Michael Franti, I was with a group of 4 people and we had a 12 pack of beer, several high-point Epic beers, 2 bottles of wine, 1 bottle of gin and 1 bottle of whiskey. You should bring a picnic dinner as well of you want to go full yuppie :)   Make sure to bring a jacket and some blankets - it can get pretty breezey and chilly when the sun goes down. Chairs are allowed, but they have to be short. This year, I've already been to Passion Pit and Chromeo/ODEZA and the regulations have not changed. Hope this was helpful."
SaltLakeCity,386swl,HatuutaH,5,Wed Jun 3 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"Basically they get away with it because they are not providing the strong drink to people.  The second they open up a beer tent, however, they would have to shut down people bringing it in.  So, the loophole is that they don't have a liquor license, and since it isn't illegal to consume in Utah publicly (go figure), there is nothing that can be done.  In any case, if you look at the DABC page on the matter, you will be very confused.  Who in the hell knows how they get away with it.  I will note, however, that the public consumption thing is a pretty well-kept secret in Utah.  Unless the city you are in has a specific ordinance against drinking in the street, you can do it:  just like Las Vegas.    Remember that legislator a few years back who was livid that someone was drinking a beer on the ski lift and wept on the House floor because of it?  Oh, Utah."
SaltLakeCity,386swl,jasmine85,4,Tue Jun 2 13:15:44 2015 UTC,Now I want to hear all about this legislator weeping and wailing and gnashing his teeth
SaltLakeCity,386swl,HatuutaH,4,Tue Jun 2 13:24:06 2015 UTC,"Well he wanted to ban anyone from drinking on the lifts.  He was doing the standard testimony meeting weeping while conveying his horrific tale of how a dude got on the lift with him and HAD A BEER!  Thankfully, reason prevailed and he was shot down.  It was done on the DL, however, as are most things in the Utah Legislature."
SaltLakeCity,386swl,stonguse,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"Wait, it isn't illegal to consume publicly? So you could walk down street drinking beer from a can?"
SaltLakeCity,386swl,HatuutaH,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:26:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on the ordinances of the city you are in.  It is illegal in SLC and Park City (as they mention in the link), but not in other cities."

I have a feeling that if you tried it in one of the cities that don't have the ordinance, they'd pass it pretty quickly after you flaunted your freedoms, however."

According to her it has to do with Red Butte Gardens being owned and operated by the University of Utah. The U of U is a dry campus (lol, nope) so the university can't sell alcohol. So the good news is this probably doesn't have anything to do with Utah's dumb liquor laws."

I cannot tell you how many times I've had negative experiences with drunken groups of concertgoers at Red Butte.  8 yuppies who put down a bottle of wine each and start shouting to each other over the concert.  Mother fucker, the stage is UP THERE.  Put your phone down, you're not going to watch the video later.  If they were selling beers at concert prices you could still enjoy a beer or two, but there would be some friction on the drunk-and-obnoxious vibe that pervades the venue now."
SaltLakeCity,386swl,HatuutaH,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:43:14 2015 UTC,The U can't sell beer or wine.  End of story.  It is illegal for them to do so.  Ever get a beer at Rice Stadium or whatever they call it now?  Nope.  The U can't legal sell beer and it is stunning that the Legislature hasn't flipped its gourd that people tailgate with abandon.

SaltLakeCity,38ap7m,jortr0n,-10,Wed Jun 3 00:23:06 2015 UTC,I bought the tickets the day they were available for $43 plus ticketfly fees(total $100). Red Butte is a pricey venue and it's a sold out show.  I don't think $120 is that bad of an asking price.  I did not intend on selling the tickets until ten mins be for I posted them.  I'd be willing to break even honestly.

SaltLakeCity,389o9e,Kavaman2014,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:30:47 2015 UTC,It is a bit of a drive but you should look into strawberry reservoir     It is best for fishing off a boat in my opinion but since i dont have that option anymore I have been going up and casting off the shore.    Ask at the marina where they are biting that day and they are usually pretty helpful. Also while waiting for fish you can always throw out a crayfish (crawdad) trap and usually go home with a pound or two. Enough for an appetizer anyway

SaltLakeCity,389o9e,slcjk,-2,Wed Jun 3 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"Freshwater, summer only.  Most fishing is in reservoirs.  If you drive up to Idaho or wyoming there is a lot of fly fishing."
SaltLakeCity,389o9e,slcf00d13,2,Tue Jun 2 20:26:12 2015 UTC,There are plenty of places near SLC you can fish year round. And you can also find plenty of places to fly fish near SLC. The Lower Provo (below Deer Creek) is a Blue Ribbon stream that can be fished year round and the Middle Provo (below Jordanelle) isn't bad either. I also enjoy fishing the Weber River in between Coalville and Wanship.
SaltLakeCity,389o9e,slcjk,-3,Tue Jun 2 21:51:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is any year round fishing here.  Which rivers don't freeze?

With all the rain we had these last couple of weeks, I'm surprised we didn't get more lightning along with it.  Depending on where you live, we do get very heavy, hurricane force winds out of the canyons. Something to do with pressure systems coming in and forcing the air out of the canyon and it just funnels it down. Sections of freeway get closed down in Davis County.  We've had a couple of tornadoes since I've been alive."

If I remember geology 101 right, the higher elevation makes it so less water is needed to produce a storm so their storms aren't that big."

There's the super popular playground near the north west (there's a big chunk of grass on that corner and the playground is in a bit from that). That playground seems to always have a ton of kids on nice days. Then, there's a smaller playground east of that that's a bit more chill.  There's also a community pool in Liberty Park on the west side just north of Tracy Aviary. That also seems to have a good amount of people on nice days if you want to take the little one for a dip."

SaltLakeCity,381hn7,wordofgreen,4,Mon Jun 1 04:12:50 2015 UTC,"I just finished updating the story.   Jasen Asay with SLC Fire says they transported about 50 but evaluated numerous others. He said some people may have gone to/been taken to hospitals prior to fire being dispatched to the scene, and the health department is investigating the cause--which is believed to be food poisoning."

SaltLakeCity,38119a,annagrff,2,Mon Jun 1 14:40:43 2015 UTC,"I was up there too! I love the Mirror Lake Highway, I spent some time hiking, fishing, and then a bit of off roading. What's your favorite area up there?"
SaltLakeCity,38119a,louderthanthis,2,Mon Jun 1 02:25:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's my first time down (up?) that way. Our family has a cabin farther north up the highway by Bear River Station but we go through Evanston to get there. I wanted to take my kids hiking around Clyde Lake Loop today but the road up there was snowed out. We're still 3-4 weeks away from that being clear enough up there to enjoy it. We stopped at the Provo Falls for some views on the way back down."
SaltLakeCity,38119a,louderthanthis,2,Mon Jun 1 02:38:11 2015 UTC,"You should take the loop back around the Mirror like highway when you go, it may add 15 minutes to your commute but the drive is amazing."
SaltLakeCity,38119a,everest81,2,Mon Jun 1 02:46:08 2015 UTC,"It was a really nice drive out of Kamas, east. I'd never been off 189 before. I'm not sure I'll do the drive with the kids in the car again though. It was pretty painful. I live in Layton and they have a pretty low tolerance for anything outside of an hour.

SaltLakeCity,3813zs,MariaWanderookie,3,Mon Jun 1 02:10:53 2015 UTC,Pipeline trail in Millcreek Canyon.
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,nervousnedflanders,4,Mon Jun 1 17:34:37 2015 UTC,"Donut Falls is a popular one. Lake Mary is great, too. Most of my favorite hikes in the area probably wouldn't classify as ""Family Friendly"", unfortunately. If you head farther south, you could do Battle Creek Falls in Pleasant Grove."
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,TonyTheJet,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:27:44 2015 UTC,"Just did donut falls yesterday with 4 and 8 years old, they loved it. It was so crowded though, and some of the places you need to walk through by the stream are very narrow and hard to pass big groups of people. I was kind of miserable because of the big noisy crowds, but the kids thought it was cool."
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,canoodlekerfuffle,3,Mon Jun 1 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"If you go down to Sandy City Hall, in the main hall way they have maps of trails around the city, or here. The Sandy site has several trails for the cottonwood canyons as well. They are marked with difficulty as well."
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,zanduby,2,Mon Jun 1 12:39:48 2015 UTC,"Church Fork, Joe's Mountain, Broad's Fork Twin, Wildcat Ridge Traverse.  Kids love 'em."
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,agilla,2,Mon Jun 1 17:35:49 2015 UTC,"Lower Bell Canyon Reservoir is family friendly, though you'll probably want to start at the Granite trailhead at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon if you have young kids. The one off of Wasatch Blvd is a little steeper, though I've seen kids tackle that one."
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,corezero,2,Mon Jun 1 18:05:44 2015 UTC,"A lot depends on the kids. Some of mine found Stewart Falls to be pushing their abilities , but they all completed it. We like Lake Mary, Cecret Lake, Lower Bells, and Ensign Peak. Living Room is another good one but it's getting pretty warm for that now.  We used to do Silver Lake (does this sub even know about that place) when they were little."
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,bit2much,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"City Creek Canyon. Granted, the entire hike is six or seven miles (i.e. probably too long to be considered ""family friendly""), but a lot of people do a shorter version by turning back around whenever they feel like it. You can also use it as an opportunity to visit Memory Grove park and head up a little path that takes you up to the capitol."
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,paradoxymormon,2,Mon Jun 1 05:43:44 2015 UTC,The other hikes people mentioned are nice. I would like to add Jordan River Parkway. It goes from like 800 S all the way to Sandy and further. You can hop on it at any point and just stroll down and then turn around at any point. No real elevation change so it is really easy.
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,92235,2,Mon Jun 1 13:41:14 2015 UTC,Mueller Park in Bountiful is great.
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,rayinreverse,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:33:40 2015 UTC,Donut falls: to get out of the heat and city.  The living room: For sunsets/City views   Both are just long enough to feel accomplished but can be made by people of almost all abilities and there is a good payoff at the end.
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,Rawrr_dinosaurs,0,Mon Jun 1 22:58:50 2015 UTC,"What exactly is the difference between a trail of dirt and a family friendly trail of dirt? Serious question. Are you looking for a easy not too vertical hike because of little kids? The phrase ""family friendly hike"" just doesn't make much sense and I have no idea what you're actually asking for.   That said,  www.alltrails.com"
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,Ralt,2,Mon Jun 1 15:06:32 2015 UTC,I would guess a hike that isn't too physically strenuous for children or older people.
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,TonyTheJet,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:12:09 2015 UTC,"If you have little kids it makes perfect sense. Young children will not take steep, exposed portions of trail seriously, so for little kids one should avoid narrow trails with cliffs. I would also avoid trails that gain more than 1000 feet of elevation or are more than 4 miles round-trip. Anything more extreme means you're gonna have a bad time, as a parent."
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,slcf00d13,-22,Sun Jul 5 15:27:17 2015 UTC,"""Family Friendly""  We have a mormon.  Try temple square or maybe walk around the BYU campus."
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,bit2much,5,Mon Jun 1 05:24:46 2015 UTC,"no, those would be ""eternal family friendly"" hikes. Please learn the terms before you embarrass yourself again."
SaltLakeCity,3813zs,phiberosmosis,7,Mon Jun 1 20:06:38 2015 UTC,Yes because only mormons look for family activities.   /s

SaltLakeCity,3813zs,phiberosmosis,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:07:00 2015 UTC,Family friendly I believe in this context is referring to a hike a 4-year old can go on. Something with a low skill set.

SaltLakeCity,381l9p,jortr0n,2,Mon Jun 1 14:07:03 2015 UTC,"There are lots of fun white water rafting weekends available.  Check KSL Daily Deals, Groupon or Living Social.  Would she be up for trying something new?  There are day-long fly fishing retreats.    Something a little crazy?  There's a dude ranch in Southern Utah.  Would she want to be a cowboy for a few days?  The resorts at Snowbird at nice and the wildflowers should be coming up soon.  That, combined with a spa gift card would be HEAVEN for me.  There's an iFly thing in Ogden.  The Heber Creeper has murder mystery trains and dinner/music trains.  The Zermatt Resort is lovely this time of year.  If you want to wait until Labor Day, Swiss Days and the Sheep Herding Competition are going on that weekend.  My family loves that.  There's a great zip line at Sundance Resort.  And Park City has that as well as alpine slides.  For a nice day spa, go to Kura Door   Momentum is a great rock climbing gym.   A 10-visit punch pass is $150."

SaltLakeCity,380zep,louderthanthis,2,Mon Jun 1 15:42:02 2015 UTC,"I can't answer the question about whether they let you take it off base, but it is technically illegal to do so. Utah is really weird about alcohol. It's actually illegal to bring any alcohol into the state (ie,not purchased from DABC) with only 2 exceptions: One, you are flying in on an international flight (not from another state), and you have a bottle with you. Two, you are moving to the state for the first time and have brought your personal alcohol.   That said, I'm not sure how it's enforced. I'm not sure if they even can enforce it. But if you get caught with a keg, that's easier. Because all kegs are illegal in the state."

Prior to its successful bid in 1995, the city had attempted four times to secure the games; failing each time. In 1998 members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) were accused of taking bribes from the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) during the bidding process. The allegations resulted in the expulsion of several IOC members, and the adoption of new IOC rules. Legal charges were brought against the leaders of Salt Lake's bid committee by the United States Department of Justice, of which all parties were later acquitted.  Investigations were also launched into prior bidding process by other cities, finding that members of the IOC received gifts during the bidding process for both the 1998 Winter Olympics and 2000 Summer Olympics.

For during the day, I really enjoy Tracy Aviary at Liberty Park (and Liberty Park in general). There's also the new City Creek mall (owned by the church, so pleeeease invade away during pride - I will be). It's actually quite a nice/interesting mall. Worth seeing if you want to see how downtown has changed since you lived here.  Gourmandise is right near Library Square (where the pride festival is) and has good lunch/dinner and AMAZING desserts. Run by a French pastry chef- super delicious desserts of all kinds. It's a downtown favorite for me.  If your roommates want some SLC history, obviously, you can take them to Temple Square and be like ""here are the morms"". Then, head on over to Gilgal Garden and be like ""here was a crazy morm"".  The Leonardo museum is at Library Square. It usually has interesting science/art exhibits and I think they have an exhibit about homelessness in the US right now.  Speaking of library square, you'll see it at pride, but the downtown library is actually a pretty cool building. Not sure if they'll have the gates to the staircase open during the festival, but you can actually get to the top of the building and see over downtown."

SaltLakeCity,37ud3o,wbeyda,5,Sat May 30 15:03:31 2015 UTC,"Hasn't this always been their goal?   Yes, I imagine a few legislators are glad things are scarce. It does not make much sense to me; there are more full-service restaurant licenses available than limited-service.   The number of limited-service restaurant licenses, for example, is determined by dividing the state population by 7,493.  ...  Utah allows one full-service license for every 4,925 residents.   So they make almost twice as many full-service available as limited-service. If the state wants to limit the consumption of alcohol, wouldn't it more effective to have more limited than full establishments? Licensing more full establishments is like encouraging mixed drinks; wouldn't beer and wine be preferred?"

It is much more expensive to get a full bar license:   Cost may be one reason restaurants prefer the beer and wine license. After a $330 application fee, the limited-service license costs $825, with an annual renewal fee of $605, according to data posted on the DABC website.  A full-service restaurant license has an initial cost of $2,200 and a renewal fee of $935 to $1,925, depending on how much liquor is sold. The $330 application fee is the same."

Here's his full comment on his Facebook page:   Several months ago I met a man named Derek Kitchen at the passing of  Utah's SB296 bill. What an incredible man. He had a light and spirit about him that I knew was real. After exchanging phone numbers he text me the next day asking how I was holding up from the whole parade deal. Again, very genuine.  Since then we have stayed in touch several times trying to figure out ways to bring our community together, even through the disagreements we may have. Out of the blue he invited me to his wedding. I admit I was taken back. The first thought that came to my mind was ""would you go to your child's wedding if they were gay?"" I thought of my kids and the answer was yes.  He then came into my work at the Sutherland Institute and hand delivered the wedding invitation. It just felt right for me. I explained to him my beliefs on marriage and told him I didn't want to take away from his day, even though I didn't believe in gay marriage; he still said he wanted me there. I knew I had to learn something.  A friend soon asked the same question I would have asked myself as to how me going to a gay wedding and riding in front of the gay pride parade are any different?? All I will say is the wedding had appropriate clothing, no certain behaviors on floats, and messages that didn't mock God. I believe there's is a way to support an individual without supporting a particular cause that individual is about. This wedding was pretty classy and I even tried hummus for the first time. Mmm.  I didn't go as a man in a state uniform, seemingly being used for a political statement. I wasn't in the ceremony. I stood on the sidelines like I would have done at the pride parade for protection of their rights. I went to this wedding as an individual for an individual who invited me, two great individuals, Derek and Moudi. I wish them the best in their journey together. Thanks for the invite Derek and Moudi, and thanks for being my ""date"" Andrew Iotcovici.. Lol."

SaltLakeCity,37myhu,maxcoyote,6,Fri May 29 04:35:55 2015 UTC,Anything near the city is going to be bad because of light pollution. You have to get out of town to get the good stuff. West side of the lake is good. West desert stuff. About an hour away from SLC you can do an overnight camp in the high Uintahs and that's some unbelievable stargazing up there.
SaltLakeCity,37myhu,louderthanthis,6,Thu May 28 20:42:54 2015 UTC,"The best place 'near' SLC is going to probably be Knolls, UT. Here is the Dark Sky Finder, it'll be your best friend for stargazing. The top of Emigration Canyon would be my pick if you only want a 10 minute drive."

Or, head up one of the canyons to pretty much any camping area.    Some of the suburbs are also darker than others (during really heavy inversion you can see the differing levels of light pollution if you're on the scenic part of Wasatch drive), but the moral of that story is Holladay is pretty dark."
SaltLakeCity,37myhu,gingy4life,2,Thu May 28 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"Snowbird usually does a weekly stargazing night at the top of Hidden Peak in the summer, it's worth the cost of the tram ticket to get to listen to the speaker and there are usually a few telescopes set up as well.

While the west side gets short shrift here on reddit/slc it really is the place to go if you are into ethnic food and want a bit more diversity.     Best places to play sports?   The U's intramural program used to be the thing.  I have no idea any more.  The field house and Hyper will serve all your sporting needs.  You can also cheaply rent outdoors equipment from the parks and recreation department.  A lot of U students have no clue about that.   Best places to meet other young people?   School.   Are you going to live in the dorms?   Best Ski Resort? (Not a skier, can't go to Alta)   Snowbird and Brighton for boarders, for sure.   Dangerous places in town?   Draper.  ;)  Just kidding, of course, but I tire of the ""fear the west side!"" mantra.  There are sketchy places, for sure, so just use common sense.  Car prowls seem to be the biggest crime these days, as well as out-and-out car theft.    Incidents of both these have risen over the past couple of years all across the valley.

There are several food trucks, I go to. But my favorite is WaffleLuv. Its Nirvana in the form of waffles. SO good. I could give you more places as well if youd like.   Best places to play sports? This also depends on what you mean. Liberty Park has Volleyball courts and large open fields to play whatever.   Best places to meet other young people? Any of the bars/pubs downtown. Theyre all fairly close to eachother so pub crawling is popular. Non-bar type places? I am not really sure. School events? Sporting events?  Best Ski Resort? (Not a skier, can't go to Alta) Up North in Eden is Powder Mountain and Wolf Mountain are my favorites if your not into the super crowded areas.   Dangerous places in town? Rose Park, but I wouldnt say anywhere is more dangerous than anwhere else if  youre smart about it.   Best stores/ grocery shops? This also depends on where you are moving to. Give me more info and I would gladly help!  What's the comedy scene like out there? (I'm an aspiring stand up comedian) WiseGuys Comedy Club is GREAT! They have 3 (I think) venues and host open mic nights quite often, as well as have rather large, famous guests come through. Look it up, I think youll be happy!  From 1 to 10,  How would you rate the happiness of SLC? Of the people in general? I would say 10. I love it here! I am 25 YO lady, and I LOVE Salt Lake and wouldnt want to be anywhere else.  Attractiveness of other people? Also pretty far up there. Generally 7? Though quite a few above that. Depends on the part of town.  Friendliness of other people? Also depends on where you are. Most people are really very friendly, but like anywhere, you can run into some real assholes. If you look alternative, you can run into some unfriendly areas, but those are few and far between.   If you would like more info, just let me know. I would love to give you more specifics!"

SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,raisinmorals,1 point,Fri May 29 01:02:34 2015 UTC,"Gateway Heights   There are University shops over there, but you are pretty much up against the mountains/medical center.  There isn't anything to the east besides mountain, and to the west you have the university.  To the north you have the medical school and the south is Fort Douglas/Research park.    The nearest store to you is Smith's on fourth south.  You can ride TRAX to it if you don't have a car."
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,slcf00d13,1 point,Fri May 29 02:45:58 2015 UTC,"Nothing too close to you that I know, but if you follow 500th South westward you'll run into a Smiths Marketplace. Huge grocery store. 500th south turns into Foothill Drive going North/South and anything you could ever want is on those two streets. You're in a great area !"
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,oculardrip,3,Fri May 29 11:30:38 2015 UTC,"Pioneer Park and surrounding area is dangerous, especially if you're alone, and out and about at night. Be sure to check out the Bonneville Shoreline Trail, Red Butte Gardens, and the Kennecot Natural History Museum. Harmons City Creek is a decent store, though their prices are high and their selection a bit scant. Smiths on 500 East near 400 South has good prices and selection but is a tad sketchy. The lower Avenues is a meth haven closer to South Temple but an architectural joy otherwise. The upper and mid Avenues is less populated by gross junkies. I'm fond of O'Shucks Bar and Grill, Avenues Bistro on Third, Copper Onion, and Niche Cafe (awesome brunches). The folks here range from hotty to wtf? but in my experience the dating scene is pretty meh.   Brighton and Sundance are some resorts you could scope out, along with Snowbird and I'm sure a few others (I'm not big into skiing but I love hiking).  Folks here are friendly, sometimes polite, and are shitty drivers.   Such shitty driving ಥ_ಥ  Sorry for the wall of text :p hope this helps, and that you enjoy SLC!  Edit: forgot about the comedy bit! There are a few stand up places but nothing too special. Ironicaly Orem is more hopping as far as that's concerned. But I bet you could get some sweet freelance writing gigs here and there at least."

Expect that as a drawback, but know that it's still worth it to live in this amazing city despite what non-Mormons have to put up with. So much great stuff to do here and the great outdoors will blow your mind if you haven't lived this far west (I'm an east coaster myself). Welcome!"
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,slcf00d13,2,Thu May 28 23:08:25 2015 UTC,What are some things to expect about Mormons that I should know of?
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,agilla,8,Thu May 28 23:12:16 2015 UTC,"Clearly to get down voted by them, LOL. I expected as much. You know most Mormons in day-to-day interactions are super friendly and not that challenging to deal with. But they will never be your true friend unless they think they can convert you. The LDS church pretty much runs the local government and so there are weird restrictions on things like alcohol, and it can be hard to get a job in certain areas if you are not associated with the church. I used to get dirty looks at one job when I walked in with my coffee and cleavage. But the U and surrounding areas are getting less and less Mormon as more people move-in, and you will find lots of people that you have things in common with and lots of great things to do on Sundays even if a lot of the local businesses are closed. most of the time I forget all about the LDS church, and then I will have a weird interaction with someone where I'm reminded that I'm considered an outsider/invader and then I don't truly belong in this community."
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,agilla,3,Thu May 28 23:37:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight!
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,bryanut,0,Thu May 28 23:44:40 2015 UTC,"I think you need to distinguish between Utah and Salt Lake City.  If you don't leave Salt Lake City, you will hardly ever have to deal with mormons in person, only their laws."
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,acisnot,1 point,Thu May 28 23:54:49 2015 UTC,Don't demographics say it's 60%+ LDS in SLC though?
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,acisnot,-1,Sat May 30 16:58:25 2015 UTC,No. Mormons make up less than 50 % of SLC.
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,slcf00d13,1 point,Sat May 30 17:03:53 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected, but the fact that mostly 1 out of every 2 people you meet is Mormon is still significant interaction"
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,HatuutaH,-2,Sat May 30 17:09:10 2015 UTC,Most Mormons are children.  Most Mormon families have 8 children.  The only time you will encounter them is when they run into you in a store or restaurant.
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,slcf00d13,2,Sat May 30 17:13:54 2015 UTC,We're actually pretty normal.  Someone might invite you to church.  Watch out.  I guess.
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,FV55555,2,Fri May 29 03:17:08 2015 UTC,"As I assumed, I should expect however with any religion that there will be extremists. They're not fun in any religion, either."
SaltLakeCity,37n2bq,dmarie229,3,Fri May 29 03:28:23 2015 UTC,"Sure, and they're aggravating. You're incredibly unlikely to encounter any extremists, though. I'd recommend not reading any comments on the local news outlets' web websites."
SaltLakeCity,37lem3,HatuutaH,2,Thu May 28 13:58:20 2015 UTC,What was the discussion about? Can someone summarize the main points and ideas?
SaltLakeCity,37lem3,dauus,1 point,Thu May 28 20:56:11 2015 UTC,I believe they archive the recordings...
SaltLakeCity,37lem3,slcf00d13,3,Fri May 29 00:58:10 2015 UTC,The answer is clearly to prevent Mormons or abstainers of any sort from having anything to do with the DABC.
SaltLakeCity,37lem3,Arrested,-2,Thu May 28 19:21:03 2015 UTC,"Mormons maybe, but abstainers? Seems dumb to not have a balanced opinions."
SaltLakeCity,37lem3,slcf00d13,0,Thu May 28 21:51:19 2015 UTC,Because they have no vested interest in how well the DABC functions.
SaltLakeCity,37lem3,bassshred,1 point,Thu May 28 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"Their ""vested"" interest shouldn't be the restrictions of their own consumption, but interest and well being of the people. The reason why they SOULDN'T  be Mormon is because by being so, they have a conflict of interest and more likely to have a HUGE bias."
SaltLakeCity,37lem3,Arrested,1 point,Fri May 29 04:34:11 2015 UTC,Exactly. If any drug became legal it would be stupid to put only users on the regulation board.
SaltLakeCity,37lem3,slcf00d13,-1,Fri May 29 12:24:58 2015 UTC,"You do realize that in a lot of states the goal of the people selling alcohol is to provide good customer service and selection, not to control others.  California for example."

SaltLakeCity,37i7rb,majpuV,3,Thu May 28 04:40:17 2015 UTC,How effective is a checkpoint that is published with the exact times and locations?
SaltLakeCity,37i7rb,maurosmane,11,Wed May 27 21:15:51 2015 UTC,The police are required by law to publicize dui checkpoints. If they didn't the charges stemming from the checkpoint would be dropped. I'm not 100% on the law though.  EDIT: This is the specific law overseeing checkpoints. http://le.utah.gov/UtahCode/section.jsp?code=77-23
SaltLakeCity,37i7rb,SenorKerry,4,Wed May 27 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"Plus if the aim is to actually stop drunks from driving then maybe reading this article sober on a Wednesday will make more people take cabs on a Friday.

SaltLakeCity,37i7rb,maurosmane,8,Wed May 27 22:59:13 2015 UTC,"They also hope to nab people for other crimes. I.E. Possesion of drugs, expired tags, expired driver's license, outstanding warrants, etc.  These checkpoints are probably fairly lucrative for them."

They are costly and they are unconstitutional. IMHO.   Im not defending drunk driving by any means, I just think I should be allowed to drive around my town unmolested unless there is specifically something I have done to get pulled over and interrogated. Giving up my freedom to drive where I want when I want given I have done everything legally in the name of searching out a few morons isnt something I consider to be worthwhile. Believe it or not, for the size of this place, there arent that many drunk drivers much less bars.   They ought to just ramp up patrols in areas where drunk driving is more common and watch the bars. Its way more effective to be present than it is to tell everyone where most of your resources are."

SaltLakeCity,37i7rb,IgnacioLopes,1 point,Thu May 28 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"I think part of the reason they have them is precisely because there are so few bars. If you want to go to a bar, you likely have to drive quite a ways to get there."

SaltLakeCity,37i7rb,fiercechocolate,1 point,Thu May 28 03:34:38 2015 UTC,"Presence is the thing that matters most IMO. Setting up a checkpoint is a publicity stunt at best. If they want to cut down on drinking and driving, from bars at least, sit outside the bars and make your presence known. With the amount of manpower it takes to stage a checkpoint, 1 officer per bar would equate."
SaltLakeCity,37i7rb,Chemspiration,0,Thu May 28 03:56:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Supreme Court has ruled that DUI checkpoints aren't unreasonable.   Thus the Constitution would prohibit people from being stopped without a search warrant or at least without probable cause that they have committed a crime; however, the warrant requirement only attaches should the search be unreasonable and the Supreme Court, as shown below, decided that such stops are not unreasonable under certain circumstances.   Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_checkpoint#Legality_in_the_United_States  It was specfically this case that they ruled on. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Department_of_State_Police_v._Sitz  But, if you're going to have an issue with the fourth amendment. Then you should also take issue with the violation of the fifth amendment violation. Since failing to submit to a sobriety check carries the same penalty as failing one.  Edit: I'm not disagreeing that DUI checkpoints are stupid and our resources might be better spent elsewhere. But, the court has ruled that it is not unconstitutional.  I think that's another reason they publicize where they will be at. That way the public has foreknowledge that they will be stopped in these areas. They could probably even argue that since they publicized it, you driving through the area gave them some sort of consent."
SaltLakeCity,37i7rb,slcf00d13,3,Thu May 28 02:50:17 2015 UTC,"The court has also ruled that limiting campaign contributions from incredibly wealthy, corporate backed individuals is constitutional as well. I personally believe the supreme court to be as corrupt as the congress and the presidency. I have zero respect for their decisions past 1980 for the most part.   As for informing the public equating to consent, they would have to send a letter each week about the position of those checkpoints to every single registered voter before I would consider their definition of ""consent"" to be defined as actual consent."

Your money goes very far there -- if you're patient you'll score a house for less than $300k. It's close to Flat Iron Mesa Park, Falcon Park and of course both Cottonwood Canyons. It is so close to Alta that you can take advantage of ""Ski after 3"" on a regular basis. You get views, privacy, and negligible crime, for 2/3 of what you'd pay in Holladay and 3/4 of Cottonwood Heights. It might not be as new as some of the SW valley homes, but commute downtown is 15 minutes without traffic, about 25 minutes to the U, and about 20 minutes to Lehi. Overall, quality of life is very high.   Sandy is a healthy mix of LDS and non, but overall a very stable community with a lot of families. There are a lot of empty nesters and some of the homes need a bit of updating, but overall they're well-built and you get a lot for your $$$ there.

You also don't have to deal with Riverton's water when you are on the border. (Riverton water isn't the best tasting, but nothing a filter can't fix).  I've lived in Herriman and South Jordan-both always have children playing outside and a pretty large following of LDS members. If you can stand a longer commute I think Herriman/Riverton is a great choice.  Currently live in Sandy/Midvale. If you want easier access to things it is great living so close to I-15 and so many stores. There are still plenty of parks and Canyons school district is pretty good. There are a lot of families around, but it seems like while the LDS following is still strong it isn't as strong as it is in South Jordan and Herriman. I think you'll be very happy in the southern part of the valley."

SaltLakeCity,37d75w,Ceedub260,3,Tue May 26 20:47:01 2015 UTC,"The article says it's open on Sunday. I'm gonna check it out. It does say it's a small stock, but something is better than nothing. Maybe they don't sell on Sundays, but I'll have to head up there sometime and see. Besides, I can see from your flair you live close to me, we all know how bad it sucks that our liquor store closes at 7. Especially now when it's not getting dark until around 9.

SaltLakeCity,37d75w,HatuutaH,3,Tue May 26 20:49:49 2015 UTC,Meh:  the law seems to say no about selling on Sundays.  The new place can't be defined as a resort package agency or a manufacturer one.  Those are the only types that are allowed to sell on Sunday.

SaltLakeCity,37d9qs,dmarie229,2,Tue May 26 21:53:38 2015 UTC,I imagine some restaurants/cafes that are dog-unfriendly were getting upset over losing customers.  Solution: lobby for stricter regulations.

So of all the problems our city has with the homeless, road maintenance, parking enforcement, etc.  You'd like them to spend extra tax dollars to training people on how to keep dogs away from food preparation?  Has there been a rash of dog hair in people's food?  Has anyone gotten sick?  No.  So why?    The article says here have been NO applicants for the already established permits.  Why?  If you have to pay a fee to have a permit to have a dog area in your restaurant, as a restaurant owner, you will just get rid of the dog area to avoid the fee and people who would like to eat with their dogs will now have nowhere to go.

SaltLakeCity,37d9qs,Jekyllhyde,1 point,Wed May 27 13:57:19 2015 UTC,"If the restaurant owners don't want to pay, a small permitting fee that's too bad.

SaltLakeCity,37d9qs,Wegg,0,Wed May 27 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"Think of the principle of what you are saying.   How is this any different from the Zion Curtain stopping drinks from being openly served?  Most agree that is an equally stupid requirement for restaurant owners.  But your position is the same as those who say.  ""People should just drink in their homes"".    Or. . . ""A gay couple should just move to another state if they want to get married.  If they are committed to being married, that isn't too much to ask.  You would be surprised what disgusting things gay people get up too.""    Where is the tolerance?  If you want to live in a culturally rich and vibrant city. . . the last thing you should be asking is for the minority to be pushed out through legislation just because you don't agree with the way they live their lives."
SaltLakeCity,37d9qs,Jekyllhyde,4,Wed May 27 15:50:05 2015 UTC,"You're comparing people being allowed to bring there dogs to a restaurant to gay couples being allowed to get married? No one is trying to stop restaurants from allowing dogs, just making sure proper food sanitation regulations are being followed. $350 one time and $100 a year after is hardly oppressive. And my point was if restaurants choose not to allow dogs, owners can still eat with there dogs in plenty of other places."
SaltLakeCity,37d9qs,Wegg,0,Wed May 27 17:11:39 2015 UTC,The fact that no one has applied for this permit tells me that the regulation did exactly what it was intended to do.

SaltLakeCity,37d9qs,The_Revisioner,14,Tue May 26 22:37:17 2015 UTC,"No, but it's not something that needs regulating.  I love taking my dog out to eat with me after a long, hard hike or run. There are only a handful of restaurants that clearly state they like well-behaved dogs, so the 2012 law is only creating another hurdle for them (and more revenue for the state with the $100 annual fee).   All businesses need to do to NOT allow dogs on the patio is say ""We only allow Service Animals""... No fee, no law, and no need for enforcement. Why can't it be the same for businesses that WANT to allow dogs?"
SaltLakeCity,37d9qs,The_Crass-Beagle_Act,3,Tue May 26 23:34:57 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm a dog lover, but I think I'm in the camp that doesn't want to eat in the vacinity of dogs. I'm more than fine letting dog-friendly restaurants do their thing though, and I'll just go somewhere else if it makes me uncomfortable.   This dog patio permit just seems weird to me. I don't really understand what paying a fee to gain a permit does to solve any sort of problem. If the state decided that having dogs on the patios of restaurants is a legitimate public health and food safety concern, it would need to just outlaw that practice outright, but it doesn't seem to be about that. It's just a way to increase revenue by selling permits and writing citations."
SaltLakeCity,37d9qs,DeadSeaGulls,9,Wed May 27 12:30:01 2015 UTC,"Then don't sit near the dogs.  I don't smoke, so I don't sit by the smokers on the patio. You have options. Point is, why regulate peoples options?  well, if this city (which isn't very dog friendly despite being very outdoorsy) see's a way to make money off of every day behavior, they are going to do so.

You might be a terrific, responsible, awesome dog owner. But I, for one, have lost my tolerance for Lassie licking my toes or wrapping his cord around my chair to go for that fallen taco.

Do you really not understand that not everyone likes dogs?  I find this mentality to be quite selfish and stubborn.   And btw, I'm an avid dog lover. Have one of my own, and love taking her everywhere I can. Which is a fucking shit ton of places around here. Not a restaurant, though. I just don't think it's worth risking putting anyone else out.

The dog park tends to be 100% energy time, but very little relaxing around other dogs. It's not like the dogs are on the table or being somehow more unsanitary than eating outside is to begin with."

I wouldn't call myself fluent by any stretch but I took several semesters of courses and then I lived in ye olde Sverige on a scholarship for about four months after graduating, so I got lots of native practice in.

If you're Mormon of course you want to see that stuff; if you're not Mormon it's very interesting in an observational way. (I'm personally not Mormon.) There is a lot of great hiking around the city. Big cottonwood canyon is beautiful. My favorite things around here are the natural history museum, red butte botanical gardens,  Tracy aviary, and the aquarium (pretty good for a landlocked state). There are also a lot of festivals all year and you can check them out on the events page of the cityweekly website. The ski resorts offer alpine slides which are pretty fun especially for children (research which ones offer it.) Not too far is Thanksgiving point with gardens, children's science museum, and an incredible museum of ancient life. The Leonardo museum still has a bodyworld exhibit going I believe. For food- I love caputos downtown for Italian sandwiches. It's also directly next to a French cafe and am amazing Belgian waffle shop. The red iguana is highest rated Mexican food and it's pretty good. The pie is great cheap pizza and setebello is pizza right from Italy. Red rock has really good food and beer (family friendly)."

Every studio is different so I think it depends on what you're looking for. Eg- I took classes for a long time at The Front (Propulsion Pilates) and it was a pretty hard core workout, but I didn't like their reformers and they only had a few so they would rotate on the bench and kettle bells, which is all fine and good but not what I was looking for. At the JCC, I'm finding a really professional experience, proper equipment and techniques, and a workout that is geared towards true Pilates results. If you're gonna commit to it for a while, I would pay for drop in classes and try different places before picking one. I know it's expensive but it is an expensive commitment in the long term."

SaltLakeCity,37chay,MinimusNadir,0,Tue May 26 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"I am willing to make some compromises since I have been looking at higher density living places like condos for rent.  I know I can't have everything on my wish list, so while privacy may not be perfect, quiet shouldn't be that hard to find.  Not to mention I am willing to pay more than most people.  $1,000 is pretty good.  I am even willing to pay a little more if it means utilities are included since it would come out around the same price as one that is 1,000 and utilities being separate."
SaltLakeCity,37chay,MinimusNadir,9,Tue May 26 16:57:24 2015 UTC,"The problem  is that you're not the only person that likes that part of town, a LOT of people like it, for the same reasons that you do.  Since they're not making any more of that part of town, the more people that want to live there, the higher prices go.  People who own property there had to pay a lot of money to get it, so they're not going to rent it out at a loss.  Three rules of real estate value:  Location, location, location.  Nice place in the nice part of town is going to be expensive.  Twenty years ago, I used to pay around $300 per month in that part of town for a single bedroom in a basement with a shared bathroom and kitchen, no utilities included.  Friends renting a basement of their own, but with no windows, was something like $600 back then.  By the time you're talking about a whole place to yourself, after twenty years of inflation, it doesn't surprise me that a grand might not even get you in the door."
SaltLakeCity,37chay,aerickse,1 point,Tue May 26 16:59:56 2015 UTC,"That's true.  I looked at a random few on KSL though and it seems like one can get a semi-decent place under a grand.  It may only be a 1-2 bedroom, but that sounds like where OP is looking anyway since a house may not get to happen but a semi-decent townhouse could work."
SaltLakeCity,37chay,overthemountain,1 point,Tue May 26 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I totally get what is being said here in that a house is really unlikely, but a townhouse or nicer apartment would work.  I just have no idea where/how to look.  Tons of people here post about their good finds in other moving threads that sound pretty close to what I am looking for since a few have talked about having a place in Sugarhouse around my budget or drove and happened upon some place that was better than the one they were going to see from an ad online.  I just have no idea how they get them."

SaltLakeCity,37chay,Activated_Trap_Card,2,Wed May 27 05:31:13 2015 UTC,"If my renting history is any indication, $1,000 is not really all that great.  First house is SLC was not in your area - it was near Liberty Park around 900E and 1300 S. It was 2 bedrooms 2 baths for about $900/mo. An old home but it worked out well enough. This was 8 or 9 years ago though.  Next was a basement - 1 bedroom 1 bath for $600/mo including utilities over on 3300 S and 1000 E. It was really run down.  Then over to a nice townhome a block over at 3300 S and 1100 E. It was 2 bedrooms and 2 baths but it was like $1300/mo.   Then a 2bed/2ba basement right in Sugarhouse - 2100 S and 1000 E for $850/mo.   Finally a 3bed/1ba sort of townhome (1 story) near Liberty Park area for $950/mo (about 1700S 300E). This was one of those homes where your front yard just had a sidewalk between your house the the neighbors across the sidewalk - no road between them. This was definitely the least ""desirable"" of the places we lived. Every unit had a small fence around their front yard and I think 70% of the people had pit bulls.   Anyways, you can see that none of these places really meet many of your requirements other than they are close to your budget. I'm not saying they aren't out there - and less bedrooms/baths would make it easier, but I'm not surprised that it's a tough search. $1000/mo isn't really that much considering your requirements.  People aren't calling you back most likely because the place is already rented."
SaltLakeCity,37chay,Grumbleduke7749,5,Tue May 26 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"I don't have much advice on where to look, but I have this to say; if your calls are ignored before renting a place, can you imagine how attentive the landlord would be after you rent?  These people may not be someone you would want to rent from anyway since they won't take the time to talk to you before you become a customer.  Good luck!"
SaltLakeCity,37chay,801801,4,Tue May 26 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"this time of year seems like it should normally be a good one with people changing jobs or moving post-school   End of June through the beginning of August is actually much better than May.

There are few states that offer paid leave for child birth. Hopefully the states that do offer this will have such success that other states will want to follow and adopt these practices.   The study is really about paid leave, child care, and pay gaps between genders. I don't think that qualifies a state as being the worst to raise a child in. Quality of life for a child is not a factor in this."

SaltLakeCity,377cwm,wantsomechips,6,Mon May 25 15:07:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that the lack of paid leave and other support for parents raising children, as well as some of the problems with public education in Utah, is a big problem. At the same time, I don't think it's fair to say that Utah is even among the worst places in the US to raise kids, since there are a lot of elements of the culture, lifestyle, and atmosphere available in Utah that make it a very endearing environment in which to raise a family."
SaltLakeCity,377cwm,The_Crass-Beagle_Act,2,Mon May 25 17:09:17 2015 UTC,"It's true -- if Utah wanted to attract more families (and probably not upset too many employers) they could enact maternity (and even better yet, paternity) leave as a state law."
SaltLakeCity,377cwm,ajfa,2,Wed May 27 01:32:32 2015 UTC,"Even as someone who wouldn't want to raise kids here, you're right. This study doesn't cover any of the reasons why."
SaltLakeCity,377cwm,silly_psycho,-1,Mon May 25 17:37:50 2015 UTC,"I would disagree. What about the children with single mothers. These single mothers are making less than their male co-workers, therefore these children don't have the quality of life as they should. Also I would say that childcare is a big factor in the quality of life for children.."
SaltLakeCity,377cwm,Jolsen,1 point,Mon May 25 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"I agree that single mothers deserve support, period. And, to generalize, our employment market (between the LDS ""boys club"" and the brogrammers in the tech sector) could be much better for women who want/need to enter the workplace. But that does not mean that Utah is a bad place to raise kids. If you're happily married with lots of kids and have modest means, Utah treats you very well.   In Utah, it's socially more acceptable for moms to stay at home if they choose, and (depending on the workplace) for dads to take some family time. In that way Utah is culturally a better place to raise kids than many bluer states with stronger ""work ethic""."
SaltLakeCity,377cwm,ajfa,1 point,Wed May 27 01:26:57 2015 UTC,I don't think you understand the domino effect. I'm not loving the fact I'm discriminated as a woman in the tech industry... I would never raise kids here. I would never want my daughter to feel oppressed because of her gender. I would never want my son raised with the pressure of being a sole provider and being looked down on for not wanting otherwise.
SaltLakeCity,377cwm,Jolsen,1 point,Wed May 27 02:32:03 2015 UTC,"Granted I don't know details of your work environment, but in my experience women are treated very well in the workplace here. Overall, judging by respect for family time, Utah is far better than some workplace cultures -- particularly my experiences in Austin, TX where employees are viewed as disposable mercenaries who should be exploited for all they're worth while they still work for you.   My first job in Utah was a crappy third-party game studio in Utah County, run by a boss who thought 9/11 was caused by ""the gays"". The lead programmer and my manager was a woman. Maternity leave was honored and paid, and everyone got Sundays off even during crunch time. Whatever the faults of LDS culture or the game industry, these perks would have been unheard of in game studios outside of Utah.   There are some fields (e.g., law, where my wife works) where Utah is overwhelmingly a boys' club and your only hope is to go it alone and prove to the chauvinistic assholes who hire their cousins that a woman can do a man's job and steal his clients too. But overall, plenty of women work in Utah without stigma. I've conversed with well-eductated BYU programmer moms who work for their own enjoyment (and cash) and clearly out-earn me -- good for them. If you're a woman in STEM in academia, prepare to have your career handed to you on a silver platter.  Utah is still overwhelmingly mormon and yes, old biases and chauvinism die hard. But at least there is a modicum of respect for family time (even if it is joined at the hip to a church I'll never go to). If you don't like mormon culture and feel like it's discriminating against you as an educated working woman, then ok, sure... but remember every dark cloud has a silver lining."
SaltLakeCity,377cwm,ajfa,1 point,Wed May 27 04:47:24 2015 UTC,"I know you don't know me... But you obviously don't really know how it actually is for women in the technology field... A recent study came out that found 50% of the women in the tech industry leave due to gender discrimination. The reason I chose the tech industry was because I thought the same thing you did.. Unfortunately I fell in love with it. I wish I wasn't a lead for an organization dedicated to making the industry more women friendly. That would mean there wasn't an issue... I'm a community ambassador for the most well known tech company in the world... I've dedicated everything to paving a path for women in future generations.. I'm well aware of the reality. I've experienced it myself and I don't wish it upon anyone else.   Also, Utah is the 3rd worse state in the nation for career women. That was another recent study..  There is an issue if you choose to believe it or not."
SaltLakeCity,377cwm,Jolsen,1 point,Wed May 27 05:43:42 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think 50% of men would leave tech if they could. But tech pays the bills, and we still live in a society (in or outside of Utah) where if one spouse has to be the breadwinner, it's the man.   Tech culture can be brutal, and I don't pretend that it would be better or easier to be a woman (certainly not more socially comfortable). But the opportunities for talented women are there, and women who have made it to engineering lead are respected. What is frustrating at large companies is that tech remains so imbalanced: women are a tiny minority in engineering teams, but are well represented on the finance and biz-dev side, often out-earn male engineers, get better office space and benefits. There's this feeling among (predominately male) engineers that women in marketing have no clue how to program and don't understand what their company actually does. This in my mind leads to a lot of the resentment in tech, which should instead be directed at how large tech companies (and compensation) are structured and not whether its employees are male or female. Again this is true everywhere -- Silicon Valley as well as Utah.  My other perspective is this: in about 5--10 years Moore's Law as we know it will end. Computer science will no longer be the driving force that it is now. Instead, materials science, mechanical and chemical engineering, applied math and physics, will be the fields of choice. Look around at national labs: these fields have far better female representation (and some very smart women).    Also, Utah is the 3rd worse state in the nation for career women. That was another recent study.. There is an issue if you choose to believe it or not.   I'd be interested in seeing that study... but if it's anything like this one I'm dubious.   I suppose I'm in the minority as a male in saying this, but we need to get rid of this notion of ""career woman"" or ""career man"". It's only in the United States where living to work, and nothing else, is viewed as a virtue. If a person wants to work half-time to raise kids, that option should be open to them. If you want to remove gender imbalance in the workplace, make it safe for women and men alike to have families and personal lives without having to give up on their careers. If it's socially acceptable for men to spend time with their families, women won't be the only ones who have to make a binary choice of whether to work or have kids. If you do indeed represent a large tech company and are interested in keeping women engaged in the workplace, then ironically equal paid paternity leave and ample vacation time for all employees may be the best tools at your disposal."
SaltLakeCity,377cwm,ajfa,-2,Wed May 27 13:13:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, very misleading. The title should be, ""the best states for people who want free handouts"". Then it would be more accurate."

SaltLakeCity,377cwm,dmarie229,-5,Mon May 25 16:45:29 2015 UTC,"A national organization has ranked Utah next to last with the metrics  they use to measure how states support women with maternity leave.   It's not a Utah problem, it's America's problem.   No - it's Utah's problem.  Other states are able to come with solutions to problems a whole lot better than Utah can. How typical the response to shove it off to ""America.""  Exactly what are you defending?    You know, I really think a lot of people think that the ""guvmint"" will handle anything that comes along when there is a gaping hole of needed support. I know that's the way it was with a stepfather who was paralyzed by a dumbass doctor. So everybody says the ""guvmint will help"" or ""there are programs for that (i.e. seniors)""  So I call up various state agencies, the ones that answer give me telephone numbers that are disconnected or websites that don't work or numbers to programs that are not relevant to his needs. So there is nada, nothing, anywhere to help shoulder the burden that a family has to deal with when it comes to a senior who is quadrapalegic, an invalid, and will likely suffer to the ends of his days where care and effort to take care of him only balloon in expense. Other states have some degree of respite care which would really help, Utah land of the families have nothing. So I really do know my shit when it comes to what is (not) available.  So, I really think it is like that. Deniers who think that ""guvmint"" will somehow take care of things, but in reality don't do a damn thing.  That's what these guys were measuring;   The information is based on which states support working parents.  Researchers looked at paid leave, dependent and elder care, child care, and the gender gap in the labor force.   and calling states out on it. Good for them."
SaltLakeCity,377cwm,ajfa,5,Mon May 25 18:42:46 2015 UTC,"I really think they could have expanded the conclusion on this study to say ""Raising children in the USA is worse than raising them in some western African countries."""
SaltLakeCity,377cwm,varthalon,4,Mon May 25 18:31:21 2015 UTC,"This is a horribly misleading article. What they should say instead is ""Utah is a bad place to be a single working mother relying on state support"".  According to their methodology, they are ranking states by: ""paid leave, dependent and elder care, [and] gender gap in the labor force participation of parents of children under six, an indicator that highlights gender inequality in family care of young children."" These are all important issues that can contribute to a good or bad environment for raising children, but do not equate with quality of childhood or educational opportunities. Though I'm a pretty liberal guy, some of them (gender gap in the labor force) in states such as Utah may in fact correlate with better quality of childhood, i.e. this is a state where it is socially acceptable for one parent to not work!   Having lived in other cities with kids (Chicago, Austin) and many othes before having kids, I can say Utah is extremely good for young children, with lots to do as a family, good museums, emphasis on bilingualism in many elementary schools. Class sizes are large (due to large families) but teacher pay is not abysmal, and generally people here value public education (at least at the K-6 level). In other places these facilities just don't exist, or you have to pay through the nose to get them (either in the form of private school, winning a lottery or buying into a better neighborhood). In Utah, the low scores and high classroom sizes actually hide the fact that this is a fairly egalitarian state in terms of where resources are spent, compared to big expensive cities (particularly on the east coast).  We have a long way to go for high school education, however."

There's some really great things and cool people but the culture, both from the Mormons and from their extreme opposites, can be extremely exhausting over years and years.   Which is sad, because the geography here if you're into the outdoors is really world class.   That being said, I'd still live in Moab hands down anytime, second only to San Francisco in terms of places I could see myself retiring some day."
SaltLakeCity,3716pd,abbaby85,1 point,Mon May 25 17:50:14 2015 UTC,It is a decent place - There are pros and cons to it like every city ever. SLC has a lot going on usually but not as many people as most major cities so there are smaller tighter groups typically where you recognize a lot of the people into the same things as you more often.   There are good and bad to every place ever but I wouldn't discourage people from moving here.

I'm not LDS, but I grew up in a town that has a heavy LDS influence. I feel that Salt Lake is fairly progressive. I do feel that some of the state liquor laws are ridiculous, but from my understanding they have been reformed over the years. This area continues to grow because the economy is great here. It's only going to get more progressive and diverse. Salt Lake may be on the edge of something great."

I would also not recommend moving anywhere in Salt Lake County outside of Salt Lake City.  If you must live outside of Salt Lake City in Salt Lake County, the farther south you live the more mormon it will be.  The other thing you should know is that most people on this sub are mormon and don't live in Salt Lake City."

Sure there are many places in Utah that are still overwhelmingly LDS (much of Utah County, especially) -- and there are pockets in SLC (e.g. Daybreak) that will be heavily mormon with young families. But as counterexamples,  Cottonwood Heights, Midvale even north Sandy are about as mixed as most of downtown. These days, I'm more likely to see my neighbors' kids headed to Sunset Coffee for D&D than going to the ward. Times they are a changing."

If we're talking about the 11th E and 21st S area, which is mostly new infill, pricey apartments and some older single-family house rentals, then that's not a particularly LDS-heavy neighborhood just because it tends to attract new transplants, renters and people going to the U (the ""heathen"" school). On the other hand, my cousin lives in sugarhouse near Hollywood and 2000 E, and that's comparable to my neighborhood in north Sandy in LDS/non-LDS makeup, i.e. about half and half. Neither neighborhood is particularly racially diverse -- mostly white and few asian families, yuppies all...  In any case, there's no hard dividing line between trendy ""urban"" non-mormon utah and the uncool suburbs where the mormons live."

SaltLakeCity,3716pd,jgoodwin27,4,Sun May 24 00:44:04 2015 UTC,Short answer?  Yes.  It's very visible
SaltLakeCity,3716pd,Jakedubbleya,2,Sun May 24 03:49:08 2015 UTC,"Well, there's this sort of thing.       But, mostly the LDS church just influences local politics through its influence on popular opinion, which is substantial. Utah cities are ~40-90% LDS. SLC is ~40% LDS, while Provo is ~90%. Local politics (kind of) reflect these numbers, but as others mentioned, there is plenty of gerrymandering, and Democrats here have to compromise constantly, but the Republicans rarely have to do so -- except in SLC city politics. State politics and UT representation in U.S. politics is all under LDS/Republican control."
SaltLakeCity,3716pd,jgoodwin27,-1,Sun May 24 04:41:34 2015 UTC,"I have no knowledge diffinitively one way or another, I can't say that yes there are or are not secret conversations where things are or are not said. I don't know either way.  With that being said I was raised in the church but am fairly neutral on it, and have lived in many places - most recently Utah for the past while.  Now all the disclosures out of the way (reddit has ruined me because I know someone is going to comment blah blah blah complaining about sources or some BS like that even with those disclosures) ...       But knowing how the church opperates and having seen every side of it from every angle both in and out of it. I wouldn't think they would threaten excommunication at all - it doesn't sound like the church in any shape way or form. However most of the politicians that are mormons major interactions are only in their churches so they see people reaffirming their views and their delegates and like minded individuals so they tend to vote along church standards. Also a large number of the politicians are LDS so we tend to have a majority vote of things running down LDS standards and beliefs. So living in Utah a lot of the laws and rules and skewed in a way to promote the church standards - but it isn't something I see as something any other large groups do constantly (whether it be a church, company, activist, ect)."

SaltLakeCity,3716pd,jgoodwin27,5,Sun May 24 00:52:39 2015 UTC,"My opinion after examining this topic at length is that the politics in the state are more driven by Republicans than Mormons. There's obviously a huge amount of overlap, but for example take the recent anti discrimination bill that recently passed with the Church's support. There were numerous conservative republican politicians (members of the Church) that came out against that bill.  Honestly it's pretty sad when the Church is more liberal than the Republicans. It really depends on the issue, however."
SaltLakeCity,3716pd,phantomtofu,7,Sun May 24 15:15:58 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with this here...  Yes the LDS church has its opinion and often makes it know (this is their home too). But most of damaging politics in the state is along the Republican/Democratic split not the Mormon/Non-Mormon split.  Having such a republican super-majority that the democratic minority seldom gets heard is where the problem in Utah politics lays.  In general Mormons are much more moderate in their political beliefs than either of the political parties (given the current atmosphere of polarized partisan politics that prevails across the entire country, not just within Utah)."

SaltLakeCity,370kch,MoriSummer,5,Sun May 24 00:43:26 2015 UTC,"When going downhill you downshift into a lower gear and don't touch the gas pedal. This will cause a vacuum in the engine and cause the car to slow. Your engine will be at a much higher RPM while doing this but as long as your car is in good shape, no harm is done at all.   This is a common technique that truckers use but because of their weight they have a mechanical assist by way of the Jake Brake. It will keep the intake valves closed in some cylinders so an even greater vacuum is created.   In doing this you will still have to use your brake to slow you down when if it is to steep, but you won't have to use it as much thus saving your brakes from over heating and failing.   Edit: Invest in a good set of snow tires also. A rear wheel drive with weight in the trunk and a front wheel drive car will be almost as good as an all wheel drive car in the winter.

It was particularly noticeable with face-to-face customer service at the retail level (store clerks, retail sales assistants, waitresses, etc), In SLC service is usually quick, competent and professional - people that wanted to do a good job because it was their job and they are proud to do it well. In D.C. you get the impression from the people in the same positions they are just there for the paycheck and how dare you be so rude as to make them actually do work for that paycheck by actually showing up to shop there?   For some reason grocery shopping in particular always annoyed me.  SLC: cashier smoothly removes each item from the cart and with a quick economical motion move it across the scanner. The item is then smartly bagged with like items so it will be easier for you to put them away when you get home. Finally they put everything back into your cart in a logical order (heavy stuff on the bottom, fragile stuff on top) to minimize the risk of anything being damaged.   D.C. cashier snatches up an item from your cart. They slowly examine the item from all sides trying to find that illusive barcode. Meanwhile they keep glancing at you as if wondering why you would be stupid/perverted/weird enough to want to buy such an item while continuing their gossip session with the cashier in the next aisle. Finally finding the barcode after looking directly at it only 3 or 4 times they wave the item apathetically over the scanner multiple times until more out of luck than skill it is scanned. Now lets throw all your items randomly into bags and into the cart with no regard to what should be bagged together or shouldn't be stacked on top of something else.

If you are willing to be a bit further out 6-10 blocks you will find a lot more options. My landlord has a few openings around 500s and 800e of 400n and 300w   http://ambrosere.com/vacancies/"

SaltLakeCity,36zri5,Dritalin,4,Sat May 23 16:39:31 2015 UTC,"I may as well explain the address system here so you know what 500s and 800e mean.  The Mormon temple is the center of Salt Lake City. The street directly South of the temple is South Temple. Directly West, you guessed it, West Temple. Every block after that goes in increments of 100. So 500s is 5 blocks South of the temple, and 800e is 8 blocks East of the temple. 12000s is 120 blocks South of the temple. You also don't generally say them outloud by the hundred. So you don't say ""eight hundred east"" rather you say ""eighth east"" or ""One-hundred and twentieth south""  It was a brilliant system until the damn gentile developers moved in and started using curving named streets in the suburbs.  It was a system that Joseph Smith claimed was revealed to him as prophesy before the Mormons migrated to Utah. It's called the ""plat of Zion."" Brigham Young used the plat in laying Salt Lake City. The plat detailed the address system, mixed agriculture into city blocks, and specified how wide the streets needed to be. This is why Salt Lake City has such wide bearing streets in it's metro. You'll notice this. Main Street is landscaped and has a light rail line, wide pedestrian sidewalks with large planter boxes, while throughways like State street have three lanes on a side, shoulder parking, and a sidewalk. A lot of streets like 2nd South and 3rd South have a lot of 45 degree parking.  The plat of Zion design was never fully implemented, and was meant to fill the earth, which still hasn't happened. But anyone like me who's had a delivery job can sure appreciate the system.  If you're moving to Salt Lake, be prepared for a mountain of bigotry, regardless of which side you're on. Mormons hate the gentiles, and the gentiles hate the Mormons. It goes all the way back to the U.S. congress sending an army to squash the Mormons, or Brigham Young telling Mormons not to buy from non-Mormons. I've honestly never lived in a more bigoted city."

Also read the comment below for more important tips from /u/exdeeu
SaltLakeCity,36w0t5,fortinwithwill,4,Fri May 22 17:33:28 2015 UTC,Youtube is your friend.  Search for a video using the make and model of your car and guarantee someone has filmed step by step instructions to walk you through it.
SaltLakeCity,36w0t5,dmarie229,2,Fri May 22 21:12:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can change the pads, but you probably cannot diagnose whether your rotors are warped or damaged. So, you may want to have them looked at if you change your pads yourself."
SaltLakeCity,36w0t5,Excelcius,1 point,Sat May 23 00:04:57 2015 UTC,"This is what I was thinking. I've done brakes before, maybe twice, but it was a simple job and I had my Grandpa looking over my shoulder. I don't have automotive know how. And it turns out I had pressed through the pads and the rotors had to be replaced (which I figured because of the sound it had started making). So I'm glad I didn't do them myself. I ended up using the mobile brake replacement service and he did a great job. It was very convenient. Thank you for the response, I thought about maybe just chucking this thread because I didn't want to respond to the people telling me to do it myself. I'm a photographer, professionally, I do it well because I know what I'm doing. Someone else could take there own pictures but they might not turn out as well as mine. I might fix my own brakes but it probably wouldn't turn out as good as a professional doing it."
SaltLakeCity,36w0t5,mellor21,1 point,Sat May 23 00:09:58 2015 UTC,"Just for future reference, most brake pads (other than the very cheapest) have a metal tab that will touch your rotor before your pad runs out. So when you hear that noise it means that they're almost gone but you have a little time. Also never buy the cheapest, go for the mid-range at least. Glad you had a good experience.

I love to fish in the mountains, but when you have young kids, strollers, wheelchairs, or grandma accompanying you, the community fishing ponds are a godsend. They are always well stocked. Most have trout all winter, which are still being stocked (The stocking report says they planted 1000 rainbow trout in Murray on the 12th, but they often start adding catfish this time of year too, and the stocking report is usually a couple weeks behind)  You should be able to catch plenty of bluegill this time of year too. Just use a bobber with a tiny hook and a very small chunk of worm in about 3-5 feet of water, 2/3 of the way down. They're small, but fun. You might also want to try for catfish and maybe bass.   P.S. If you want to try for trout in Murray later in the warmer weather, go to the southeast corner where the spring flows in ;)  *edited because I forgot word and don't spell reel goodly."

SaltLakeCity,36rf2h,HatuutaH,12,Thu May 21 15:02:11 2015 UTC,"From the article it seems like you have a police chief who wants more social workers to help get repeat offenders off the streets and citizens who just want to see more police in their neighborhood.  There are a number of other parties involved but I feel like I have to side with the police on this one. The citizens complaining seem to mostly be concerned about a lack of police presence. There hasn't been an increase in crime. It was mentioned that response times had slowed but this was just a quote by a councilman without further proof, so it's difficult to corroborate.   I mean, does it seem odd to anyone else that the police chief doesn't want more officers? You would think normally they would be behind something like that. I'm all for reducing recidivism.   I'd be more supportive of police presence if there was a more demonstrable need for that presence. From this article it seems like people are just worried because they don't see as many cops around as they used to. If crime rates are still low, that sounds like a good thing to me."
SaltLakeCity,36rf2h,overthemountain,2,Thu May 21 17:06:37 2015 UTC,"It's a splitting issue.    Groups are calling for more officers because there are problems that are not being addressed, and people are doing things against society. The people want more officers because they want more enforcement.  As they point out, officers are already going from call to call, with no time between.   On the other hand...  There are people who are doing things against society. Murders, rapes, robberies, leaving drug needles in parks. An alternative approach is to stop them BEFORE they reach that point. That's why Chief Burbank wants more social programs.    It is not an either/or situation.  We need both.  Help people so they won't be inclined to harm society. Social programs to help people be content with life, gainfully employed, well-fed, educated, and socially beneficial. Solve the problems BEFORE people are inclined to turn to crime. And also when some people harm society, get them rehabilitated and back into society if possible, removed from society if not."
SaltLakeCity,36rf2h,rabid_briefcase,3,Thu May 21 19:06:40 2015 UTC,"Early in the afternoon last Tuesday, I was moderating a meeting that included Council Member Mendenhall and District 5 Detective Manzanares. As someone who operates a facility in Liberty Park, which is one of many facilities, he told us that there is ZERO presence of police other than patrol cars that arrive when called, and then response time is dependent on the priority.   This article seems to be a direct result of some of our conversations earlier that day. There is no budget for even a nominal police presence in the outlying areas. He described it like a sponge. If you focus all of your effort in one area, the water will be forced out the sides. That's what's happening here.  Is the crime rate higher? I doubt that it is exponentially, but is there a consistent presence from bike squads? Absolutely not."

SaltLakeCity,36rf2h,gingy4life,1 point,Thu May 21 17:33:24 2015 UTC,"This does not constitute special treatment.  Its a lack of foresight on the Police Dept to not budget for changing neighborhood dynamics.  The point is that NO neighborhood should have to see a reduction in their police presence, and every community is entitled to feel safe and protected.  If we need to increase for more police, then so be it."
SaltLakeCity,36rf2h,gingy4life,3,Thu May 21 18:40:54 2015 UTC,"Have you seen Fairmont Park lately?  There are drunks lying about, fighting on the sidewalks and sketchy people hanging around the restroom.  I don't think residents want special presence, we want the presence that has been there before.  Fairmont Park lost a lot of family activity when that homeless woman was murdered in the bathroom a year of so ago and I haven't seen much of an increase in police presence.  I get that downtown businesses want to attract customers around Pioneer Park, but let's not neglect the other communities for this one initiative.    And I don't know what numbers Burbank is citing, but the uptick in car thefts, b-and-e's and assault appears to be rising according to our neighborhood council.  In the last year, the number of meth heads trolling around sugarhouse has dramatically increased.  Again, no need for ""special"" police presence but I pay my taxes too and think we need a little more around sugarhouse."
SaltLakeCity,36rf2h,jeffha4,7,Thu May 21 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"I live right by 9th and 9th, and I feel the same way.  I've chased car prowlers out of the neighborhood.  There are always neighbors saying they've had homes/cars broken into.  I live in an upstairs/downstairs duplex, and the basement unit had a B&E a couple years ago.  My car was prowled just last week!  I always see broken glass on the street in the mornings...  To answer /u/overthemountain - A higher police presence (just driving the streets occasionally) would hopefully curb some of that activity. As of right now, the only time I see a cop in my neighborhood is if there are detectives scoping out homes, or the son of my neighbor in his patrol car maybe 2 times a month visiting his mom.  Just drive by occasionally at night, keep the criminals on their toes."
SaltLakeCity,36rf2h,overthemountain,3,Thu May 21 18:00:43 2015 UTC,If there is an increase in criminal activity then that's definitely a different matter. The article never really made that case. I moved out of SLC about a year ago but had lived within the city limits for about 10 years (mostly Sugarhouse and Liberty Park areas) before that and never really noticed an increase in criminal activity personally.   I'd love to see some actual data. I'm sure if we ask enough people we can find anecdotes to support just about any stance we want to take.
SaltLakeCity,36rf2h,slcjosh,1 point,Thu May 21 19:01:56 2015 UTC,"You can also do things to deter prowlers and theft. Like not leaving shit out on your car seats for junkies to smash your windows and grab.

When the woman was murdered was the icing on the cake, but no one went in that park after dark since the mid 2000's unless you were:   Trolling for sex: Yes this was a popular hot spot for sex workers and mostly gay men trolling for randoms to have sex with. (I have lived downtown and in sugarhouse since the mid 2000's, and worked at the 24 hour fitness located on Ashton. There was a huge percetnage of clients at the gym that were Gay and would explain to us employees how the park was used as a hook up spot.)  Looking for drugs: Fairmont was big time spot for homeless, alcoholics, drug addicts, etc who didnt work and needed places to hangout and score their drug of choice. This has been happening for a very long time.   If you were: Looking to skate board or play some footy. Lots of skaters hangout in the west end of the park, and there are always leagues of soccer going on. I also see kids practicing lacrosse, and even played their when I was in high school in the early 2000s.   The park has always been sketchy. Just like any other park in more urban environments, they simply aren't safe after dark."

SaltLakeCity,36rf2h,Dante1940,0,Thu May 21 18:59:34 2015 UTC,"I grew up in NY, and lived there until I was 28. I saw NYC as a pit in the 1980's transform into an amazing city under Giuliani in the 1990's, and really begin to thrive, and raise the bar under Bloomberg after 9/11. I've lived in SLC since 2011, and I think it's a great city, but it has a problem. It may be hard to see now, but the crime is brewing. Everyone thinks that the criminal element in SLC is petty, and that the beggars on every corner are more of a eyesore than a real problem (notice I said beggars and not homeless - they're mostly able to sustain themselves, but prey on the goodwill of the community here). As Giuliani proved, the larger crimes, the violent felonies are often prevented by starting at the grass roots. You have to take care of the quality of life offenses, the so called ""broken windows"" first. I don't want my wife walking through downtown SLC being asked for money on every corner whether it's by someone who is homeless and down on their luck, or some entitled hipster who doesn't want to work. Bottom line is, panhandling is illegal, and it's a gateway, as has been proven.  Adding quantity to the police force is a start, but changing the brass, the management of the department and its' philosophies is where you will start to see real change. It shouldn't end there either. Becker is a clown, and while he has some really good policies, none of them surround policing and controlling crime.   If Salt Lake wants to grow and develop into a world class city, they need to look at what some of the large cities have done to solve their crime problems and get ahead of it, and not wait until it's too late. Start cleaning up the derelicts now."
SaltLakeCity,36rf2h,Dante1940,5,Fri May 22 22:44:48 2015 UTC,"The Federal Court disagrees with you that panhandling is illegal:   U.S. District Court Judge Ted Stewart made the ruling Thursday in response to a 2010 lawsuit filed by three homeless people in Salt Lake City who had been cited for panhandling and claimed the ban on begging for money violated their right to free speech.   The Downtown Alliance, however, is kicking up new ordinances.  We see so much panhandling in SLC because there is no current panhandling law."
SaltLakeCity,36rf2h,Deforesting,1 point,Sun May 24 11:25:54 2015 UTC,"That's a major problem, and the Downtown Alliance is merely looking at it as an economic problem, which granted it is.

Regardless, I pretty firmly believe NYC doesn't need a small military  with questionable tactics and blatantly unconstitutional restrictions on the rights of it's citizens to do it's policing. If it actually does, maybe NYC is just breeds shitty people, and we'd be better off ignoring it, but I try to give people the benefit of the doubt."

SaltLakeCity,36rf2h,Dante1940,1 point,Mon May 25 14:06:05 2015 UTC,"Again, it's not just panhandling, it's quality of life crime in general; it's the crimes that people think are victim-less that contribute to the overall downturn, which causes a spike in more violent crimes. This is the concept of broken windows and it's been used not just in NY, but in the other cities where you have seen drops in crime. My point is that there is a lesson to be learned and with an anticipated 100% population growth anticipated in the next 20 years, I'd say being proactive is a good idea.

This teaches two lessons:   My boss needs to learn to live and let live. Smoking pot doesn't hurt my boss or his family, and probably doesn't hurt the smoker, either. The cops on the east side don't have enough to occupy their time. I remember reading about cops showing up hours later for homicide reports in some understaffed larger cities. ""Someone was smoking weed in their back yard"" should not be compelling to law enforcement.   I see them everywhere, sitting around trying to discover criminals in grocery store parking lots, in public parks, apartment complexes, etc. Not to mention the five or more cops I see during my daily commute.  If cops need to jack off to their carputers, we should let them do it on their own time.

I have seen the Division of Environmental Quality onsite once in 4 years and he was gone in fifteen minutes. Literally couldn't have cared less. Now my facility doesn't actually produce that much emissions but I feel that that attitude within the DEQ probably extends to everyone they deal with. That is just my observations.
SaltLakeCity,36tmmj,poor_burrito,2,Fri May 22 15:48:44 2015 UTC,As a DEQ employee conducts inspections I can tell you we're very thorough. Though I don't inspect polluters our survey process is very extensive.

SaltLakeCity,36q2f9,halioscar,1 point,Thu May 21 20:04:47 2015 UTC,"I've always had great luck with the buses/Frontrunner connection... Though I ride in from the north now.

SaltLakeCity,36q2f9,Specken_zee_Doitch,14,Thu May 21 06:49:34 2015 UTC,I'd say eat the twelve minutes. TRAX lines are more coordinated than Frontrunner/TRAX transfers.

SaltLakeCity,36q2f9,Shatteredhawk,1 point,Thu May 21 16:33:34 2015 UTC,You're first mistake is thinking public transit is catering only to you. They all run late sometimes and they miss connections. You want to get home fast? Take your fucking car. Otherwise load some podcasts on your phone and wait.
SaltLakeCity,36q2f9,rachie27,-1,Mon May 25 18:27:31 2015 UTC,This is exactly why I pay the premium to drive. Trax is pretty crappy unless you are traveling a short distance or direct line. I never take it on the weekend either because I like to stay out past 11pm and go places on Sunday.
SaltLakeCity,36q2f9,tynman,-1,Thu May 21 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"And people are down-voting this comment? Sadly, this is a fact of life in the suburbs.

SaltLakeCity,36q2f9,rachie27,1 point,Thu May 21 18:17:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't get the downvotes either. Apparently there are some people out there that love spending 2 hours/day on public transit rather than 40 minutes/day commuting in their own cars.

If your dog bites someone and you don't have enough coverage in your rental insurance, the person who was bitten can sue the property owner. That's one of the reasons places will allow cats and not dogs. General 'no pets' rules are usually due to not wanting to deal with the extra wear and tear and damage to the property.  Anyway, you'll probably have better luck dealing with private property owners than big buildings or property management companies. Good luck."
SaltLakeCity,36prja,brockobear,1 point,Thu May 21 04:21:20 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately even the private owners in this area all seem to stand very firm on the ""no dogs"" or ""no large dogs"" aspect.

SaltLakeCity,36prja,rathulacht,2,Thu May 21 14:07:29 2015 UTC,"Downtown areas are pretty much always more expensive and less pet friendly.

SaltLakeCity,36nan0,drdactyl,3,Wed May 20 17:59:23 2015 UTC,Have you ever been to a place that does this? It's actually not distracting at all. They usually leave space in between the table and the row in front of it (unlike Brewvies) so the servers have room to move quickly and they all do this duck and shuffle that freakishly ninja-like.

SaltLakeCity,36nan0,DesolationRobot,4,Thu May 21 17:41:53 2015 UTC,"They do a damn good job.  There's enough space between the rows to walk without a problem and the waiters are experienced at doing it and keep their heads down.

I disagree. Alamo Drafthouse, in Austin and elsewhere, generally has pretty respectable customers. They are a bar/food theater. They are particularly fierce about policing poor moviegoers and are known to toss disruptive people. I think they cultivate that culture and it pays off. They also regularly sell out shows so they don't need to worry about occasionally offending people.  I also feel that Utah audiences just tend to be a bit more poorly behaved. In my experience, at movies in Utah, it's much more common to have loud groups/kids. It seems it's just more tolerated there, by businesses and customers."

And before the downvotes come pouring in, I grew up here and consider myself a full-blooded Utahn. And in my ~30 years here I have determined that they don't know how to drive (merge, 4-way stop, not stop in cross-walks...etc...), they don't know how to tip, and they sure as fuck don't know the first thing about considering a single individual beyond themselves."

SaltLakeCity,36nan0,caligari87,9,Thu May 21 13:14:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, sorry to hear about your bad experience. I've gone to a fair amount of movies there, and haven't really had any bad experiences with the staff or audience. The worst was probably Quentin Tarantino month, and there were a lot of people who were loud and dropping their drinks.  I also don't go to movies on Friday nights though. I'm thinking that  probably played a lot into this. That being said, expectations need to be different for a place like this when it comes to the audience. Instead of crying babies, you get loud drunk people. Like any movie theater, sometimes you get lucky and don't have to put up with either.  I would give it one more try! The only reason I say this though, is because I love beer, nachos, movies and pool."
SaltLakeCity,36nan0,StarbucksnSnatches,3,Wed May 20 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"You're totally right. This is good information to know, and thank you for the kind response! I think we'll attempt it again, just at a different time on a different day. I will keep all of this in mind. I've been to theaters in New Orleans that get people all kindsa messed up on booze, but without people acting out. Maybe it's just a different climate at each individual movie/bar place. I will give it another shot, just because you made me feel a bit better about it. I just needed to rant it out. I just think about the fact that everybody has paid their cash money on the movie, booze, and food-so shouldn't we all be a bit more considerate of the staff and other movie goers? Thank you for your response!"
SaltLakeCity,36nan0,paradoxymormon,3,Wed May 20 20:17:26 2015 UTC,I tey to stay away from new releases and always go mid week. The difference between going on a Friday night versus a Wednesday night were very different. But it really is a crapshoot if you end up  with assholes or not.

SaltLakeCity,36nan0,matt1131,3,Thu May 21 06:47:05 2015 UTC,"This particular experience sounds shitty, but for me, I just expect Brewvies to be a casual establishment.  As long as people aren't total dickwads about it, I don't mind people getting up and getting food/drinks, talking a bit, laughing, etc.  It's a community atmosphere, not an Imax.  In fact, when I saw Mad Max there last week and everybody was saying 'holy shit!' at the same time, I kind of dug that compared to everybody just being utterly silent together in the same room."
SaltLakeCity,36nan0,brockobear,1 point,Thu May 21 04:46:02 2015 UTC,this was my favorite thing about watching Sons of Anarchy at Brewvies! Sure every so often people were talking but overall it was really fun to share that experience with so many people. I also really love the amazing staff and (of course) the pulled pork nachos. SO GOOD.
SaltLakeCity,36nan0,HatuutaH,1 point,Thu May 21 15:57:01 2015 UTC,"I totally get that, and I like your perspective. I think it would have been different if it went something like what you experienced. That would be cool to experience with everyone in an audience. I can see that I probably just need to be better about when and what I go to when it comes to Brewvies. I get having a good time and everything, I was just taken aback a bit. This is a good way to think of future experiences though, so thank you!"

I can't imagine people going out to have a good time during the weekend are going to be anything near considerate. Your story lends credence to my suspicions."

SaltLakeCity,36mnq6,gawllstone,7,Wed May 20 19:35:11 2015 UTC,"Also, we really need sno1, not rain.  Snow slowly melts over the course of the spring/summer as opposed to rain, which sinks into the earth/starts to run off immediately.  Kind of like a flash flood versus steady stream."
SaltLakeCity,36mnq6,SaltLakeCitySlicker,1 point,Wed May 20 20:11:27 2015 UTC,"It's hoped that reservoirs hit 100% capacity at the end of the spring runoff.  This season spring runoff is almost over and reservoirs aren't close to 100% capacity.     With warmer weather and a dry winter, much of the rain tends to soak into the ground.  In a normal snowy winter, much of that melt fins its way downstream.  Even if this rain did make it to reservoirs, it's still not enough to fill them.    But good news is that state reservoirs this year tend to be at the same or at higher levels than the past two years.  And these rains mean the ~150 day watering season can be shortened by a few weeks.  So if we made it these past two years, we'll make it this year."

Park City Mountain Resort has excellent hiking, zip-lines, alpine slides, etc.  Less than an hour's drive north of Salt Lake is Lagoon an amusement park.  Red Butte Garden is an arboretum that is beautiful to walk through, plus they often have concerts in the evenings."

On the other hand, if you have experience and know what you're doing enough to separate you from the run-of-the-mill crowd, Utah has a lot of tech companies, and there is good money to be made.  As you (probably) know, most areas in computers are more friendly to not having degrees, or only associates degrees, than some sectors.  I know experienced programmers and techs making ~$100k who either have no degree, or a degree in a completely non-relevant field.  On the other hand, I've seen some WITH degrees make $30k.

Why is the argument for taxation, always about protection? Sounds here like he wants to avoid people drinking because it'll be cheaper?"

SaltLakeCity,36f5di,HatuutaH,4,Tue May 19 14:43:12 2015 UTC,Legalize and tax marijuana at the same time that you privatize liquor. That will make up the income loss from privatization.
SaltLakeCity,36f5di,NateDawg007,5,Tue May 19 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"Washington state recently privatized their liquor sales, here's some stuff to look at.  Drunk driving actually decreased   Opponents of liquor privatization feared that making liquor sales more convenient would increase drunk driving. For that issue, the Washington Traffic Safety Commission has only partial data through the end of 2012. Fatal crashes involving a drinking driver happened less often in the second half of last year — after privatization — compared to the same period in the prior two years.   Liquor got more expensive   That doesn’t mean sales of liquor have increased dramatically: they rose 6 percent in the first year, a bit less than state forecasters had expected, and far less than what critics feared. And the most recent data point to volumes being relatively flat from last year.   What’s certain is that many consumers are feeling pinched. The average price per liter, after tax, from June 2013 to April 2014 was $24.39, about 11 percent higher than in the same period two years prior, before privatization.  The culprit: fees created by the privatization initiative to make the state whole after giving up its monopoly. Those include a 10 percent fee paid by distributors, which will drop by half this year for many, and a 17 percent fee paid by retailers.    The state is ending up losing money ,in part because people bought liquor in cheaper neighboring states.   According to tax receipts, the state isn’t doing much better. Revenue generated from liquor sales spiked in the first full year the initiative took effect, to $521 million, up more than $70 million from the year before. But much of that money came from one-time fees, totaling more than $100 million. This year, the state had collected $369 million in revenue through the end of May, 11 months into the fiscal year, which ends today.  State forecasters had expected revenues of $402 million to $480 million over the first six years of privatization. Those revenues may drop further: The 10 percent tax paid by distributors will be cut in half starting this year.  Other states considering privatization should take note of the fallout Washington is experiencing, Drenkard said. At 12 liquor stores just over the state line in Oregon, sales were up 30 percent in the third quarter of last year. Supporters of liquor privatization were gathering signatures for a ballot initiative in Oregon, though the state Supreme Court ruled in May that their ballot language didn’t meet requirements.   I support privatization but it is a complicated issue. I'd be okay with state run liquor stores if they weren't so terrible and also if did away with the weird percent alcohol beer laws and allowed full strength beer to be sold everywhere."

SaltLakeCity,36gi0n,drdactyl,3,Wed May 20 14:32:09 2015 UTC,"Salt Lake has a surprisingly good music scene for a city its size. We do get a fair number of touring bands coming through, and the clubs/bars where they play are relatively inexpensive. In addition to the music centric venues (Urban Lounge, Kilby Court, the State Room, In the Venue/Club Sound, the Complex, the Depot, etc.) there are a few restaurants that host genre-specific music nights -- Jazz at the Bayou and blues at Pat's BBQ for example.   As far as local music goes, we certainly have more that three bands. The last few years we went from spawning a bunch of alt-country bands to a renewed interest in local metal music and garage rock. To showcase these trends, in June there are a couple of events coming up. We're having the fifth year of an event called Crucial Fest, a 3-day bar-music festival that features an impressive amount of local and national talent. Two of SLC's best and most renowned bands will headline the local side of the fest -- Eagle Twin and Subrosa. I can't say enough good things about these bands. You'll want to bring earplugs.   Also in June, SLUG Magazine is releasing a vinyl record compilation of local garage bands and will hold events at the Urban Lounge and Diabloical Records to highlight several of the bands on the release. Details can be found on the event's Facebook page.   Of course, if you want to see cover bands play '80s music, you could always spend an evening at Liquid Joe's. Not really my thing, but it's popular enough that they keep doing it.   And there are several festivals running during the Summer months -- the Twilight festival if you're cheap and like big crowds, and the Red Butte series if you like shelling out big bucks to listen to people in the crowd compare notes on charter schools while they give the stink eye to bands who would dare interrupt the conversations they're having.   But, yeah, so many good local bands, and so many opportunities to see them. If you like rock music, try to see the Moths. If you're into surf/instrumental stuff then Rifamos will make your day. I've recently seen some of the best psych-rock coming out of SLC with a local band called Coyote Vision Group. In all, we've got a good thing going here."

SaltLakeCity,36gyis,gobdgobd,1 point,Tue May 19 14:06:25 2015 UTC,"This is a list of all known cleanup sites, which is a very small percentage.   The bad ones have already been remediated and cleaned up from what I understand. If you are renting, this is a non issue. If you were buying a house it is practically a non issue as well, though I would do my research and not buy a place next to a former smelter site as I might want to have a vegatable garden.  But I would worry more about being near places that burned a large quantity of coal i.e. the old parts of town as there could be elevated forms of mercury from the coal burning which would be more worrisome imho than the (very few) smelter operations. I.e. the soil would have a lot of coal ash in it. And, worse than that, imho, would be buying a home that had asbestos insulation in it. There is a particular type, vermiculite, that found widespread use from Montana. The other toxin that is likely more hazardous is radon gas. But that can be tested for and mitigated.   But as another poster pointed out, the most significant risk likely is our air pollution.   Edit: As an aside for completeness/perspective, places like Detroit that had extremely high automotive use in the era that gasoline had lead in it, has areas that are going to have elevated lead in the soil from the gasoline that was burned in a lot of cars nearby. It would still be there even though we have moved to unleaded gas now."

I don't think he's a Subaru specialist, but he was my go-to mechanic for several years when I was living in Provo.   If you're looking for a Subaru specialist and/or something more local, I really trust the folks at Nate Wade Subaru.

SaltLakeCity,36bsfj,isaacd2,3,Mon May 18 14:50:18 2015 UTC,"I would hypothesize that he is a bad driver. Thusly he lost his job as a driver, so he ends up being a Lytf driver. Tell your friend to file a complaint with Lytf and she should get her money back."

SaltLakeCity,369cj3,gzupan,18,Sun May 17 14:49:58 2015 UTC,"It tells you who, but not why. People who understand the dominant Utah culture already know the why."
SaltLakeCity,369cj3,dramamoose,2,Sun May 17 15:09:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It should also be noted that Utah liquor laws, compared to a lot of midwest/southern states, are actually pretty loose. I think the problem for many of us is we are surrounded by Nevada, Wyoming, Arizona, Colorado, all of whom have much looser liquor laws."
SaltLakeCity,369cj3,Chemspiration,17,Sun May 17 15:31:42 2015 UTC,"Id love to see how this is true. According to Time Magazine and several other sources Utah is the most restrictive state for alcohol control in the US. The southern states are generally not even close to the level of control that Utah exerts on the public and commercial alcohol vendors. Our laws are not even remotely ""loose."" The problem in Utah is religious interjection into legislation."
SaltLakeCity,369cj3,Dishwallah,4,Sun May 17 20:23:02 2015 UTC,Kansas has over a dozen dry counties and the same strict rules as Utah.    Oklahoma is basically the exact same as Utah minus the zion curtain.    Here is a more detailed list for each state.  Utah definitely isn't alone when it comes to strict alcohol laws.
SaltLakeCity,369cj3,Chemspiration,8,Sun May 17 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"Kansas doesnt run a state monopoly and sells liquor on sundays. Dry counties are dry because the county wants it dry. Not the entire state. Thats decidedly better.  Oklahoma also does not run a state monopoly and is not even close to the same as the Zion curtain. For businesses, they get to purchase at fair prices from a competitive marketplace. Very different.  And i read the wikipedia page that explains sales of alcohol to individuals. The page doesnt discuss alcohol regarding businesses. Which the article being discussed is about."
SaltLakeCity,369cj3,pashdown,6,Sun May 17 23:24:50 2015 UTC,Saudi Arabia and Iran have prohibited alcohol.  I'd like to see Utah emulating governments without religious intolerance rather than the reverse.

There are very few states that have complete control of their alcohol sales, let's take a look at a few examples  Kansas: Counties can still decide if they want to sell on Sunday.  Minnesota: Certain counties can establish their own stores and decide if they want  to have Sunday sales (doesn't count)  New Jersey: Extremely limited, but commercial sales still permitted. (doesn't count)  Oklahoma: Just as bad as Utah  Pennsylvania: No grain alcohol, control as strict if not worse as Utah, even beer is strictly controlled.  Rhode Island: Just as bad as Utah.  Wyoming: Just as bad a Utah.  So we have KS, OK, PA, RI, WY and UT  These are the states that have complete control off all their alcohol sales (ABV>4.0% not counted) however most of these still sell on Sunday.

Rhode Island   I didn't realize either of those were midwest or southern states!  Taking a bit more broadly:  Kansas is repeatedly mentioned as the ""driest"" state. Alcohol is banned in half the counties, liquor licenses are harder to come by than Utah. They've got similar 3.2% rules. Sunday sale is also out, plus most holidays have bans like July 4th, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving. Utah's 1:00 AM limit is late compared to their 11 PM limit. If you think it is bad for buyers, sellers in the state need both you and your spouse to have a perfectly clean criminal record, to be a US citizen for ten years, and be a resident of the state for four.  Tennessee and Minnesota forbid selling both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages together, so no mixed drinks.  Both also have no Sunday sales.  Colorado, Kansas (already mentioned), Minnesota, and Oklahoma all have similar 3.2% rules, so Utah isn't unique there either.  Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Idaho, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and several other states all have state alcohol monopolies."

SaltLakeCity,369cj3,presidiodesign,11,Mon May 18 00:15:58 2015 UTC,"I have always felt like the irony here is that the majority (if not all) of the State Liquor Taxes (about 13% over retail price) go to public education in our state. In 2007 that came to 22 Million Dollars. Ultimately the largest families in our city tend to be LDS as well. The majority of which IMO attend (our still underfunded) public schools.

SaltLakeCity,369cj3,ehampshire,2,Tue May 19 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"Also, the local breweries pretty much have a monopoly on the taps at any given bar.

If this limit gets lifted the local breweries will likely get reduced to 1-2 taps and sell less beer.  I say they should welcome the competition and step up their game, but the big ones (Squatters/Wasatch/Uinta) have all become complacent and a bit lazy."
SaltLakeCity,369cj3,gthing,2,Tue May 19 16:21:00 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but they are less likely to face competition from outside brewers who are less likely to dilute their beer just so it can see Utah's taps.

On the whole traffic is moderate compared to some other cities during rush hours. Your average commuting traffic is worse if you're heading towards Salt Lake City in the morning and away in the evening rush hours. Imagine Salt Lake City is the centerpoint to the entire region with the southern Salt Lake County suburbs & Utah County to the south and Davis and Weber County to the north. In general, I live in southern Salt Lake City and work in the Central/southern part of Salt Lake County (relatively close to interstates, 11 miles total, southbound in the AM and northbound in the PM). Usually traffic looks horrible in the opposite direction on I-15 and barring any crashes, my commute usually takes about 20 minutes. Hope this answers your question.   If you can afford it, I would look at trying a similar pattern. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions or need local insight, OP."

SaltLakeCity,369t2r,maurosmane,1 point,Mon May 18 15:13:09 2015 UTC,"Part of your university student fees will go towards an unlimited transit pass. If you don't use transit, you'll need to buy an additional parking pass if you are driving to campus and try to find parking which is intentionally limited.  Driving:commute length will largely depend on when you are headed to campus. During off-peak hours you are looking at a 20 minute drive. In the morning, during peak times 7-9 AM, routes to the U are quite congested (the reverse being true in the evening). Try to build your schedule to avoid having to drive during these times. When you take into account the time spent in traffic and looking for parking, transit would likely become a more appealing option, though taking longer at times.   Transit: from SLCC to the U you're looking at about an hour. This will be shortened if you drive to the TRAX green or red line park and ride. I hate traffic and finding parking hence a longer ride on the train is more appealing to me personally. Hell, you can study on the train but not while stuck in traffic/looking for parking."

I-15 is the only really clogged road, but it can be avoided fairly easily if you live on the west side. Rush hour usually only lasts from 430-600 or so.

SaltLakeCity,367uea,marcopastor,1 point,Sun May 17 01:14:21 2015 UTC,ah very cool! we were on the other side of the 150 and a mile or so west. but honestly there were lots of good dispersed camping spots in that area. can't go wrong.

SaltLakeCity,368ouw,neil801,8,Sun May 17 13:22:07 2015 UTC,"I entertained the idea of Daybreak a few years ago when we needed more room than the city offered.    Beyond the monotony of ""white, LDS, four kids""  - here's why I opted out of Daybreak:   The Jordan school district.   They are experiencing major growing pains right now and with the loss of the half-billion dollar bond, there aren't funds to keep building schools.  It's not that the leadership is poor or the teachers are bad.  They just didn't have the foresight to keep up with the growth and resources are being stretched thin. The land.  I know, I know, Rio Tinto cleaned up the land and everyone says it's fine.  But there's just that ""what if they're wrong""  nagging voice in the back of my mind.    My kids' long-term health is too precious and there are plenty of places in the Wasatch Front that aren't former storage sites. I love the houses.   I love the modern, clean lines and open floor plans.   But have you seen how on top of each other they are?  If I wanted to be 8-10 feet from my neighbor, I'd stay downtown."

This is a link to a post I made for other redditors that want to offer The Ultimate One Week Visitor Experience to friends from out of state or out of country.  Also, I own a little smoke shop with rolling tobacco and a pretty decent selection of mods and e-cigs. It's called The Smoke House and is located at 2343 E 3300 S. I'll hook you up if you mention you're from reddit ;)  Enjoy your time with your friend!"

Your friend must've been so chuffed. I'll have to stop by the smoke shop and say hello, so you may get a surprise visit from an Internet stranger. Doesn't that sound lovely."
SaltLakeCity,36788a,paradoxymormon,3,Sun May 17 09:42:24 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Salt Lake City! You mentioned bookstores, which happen to be some of my favorite places in the city. I have an out-of-town friend visiting this weekend, in fact, and just yesterday we did a ""book tour"" of the city (which proved to work well on a rainy day). Here are a few suggestions, starting the furthest south and working your way back up into central city:  Central Book Exchange (2017 S 1100 E) This will take you to Sugarhouse right near some of the main businesses in the neighborhood, which could be kind of fun if you haven't explored there yet. The bookshop is fairly eclectic and has a pretty sizable foreign language section, which is a bonus for me. The staff is really friendly and they have a much larger inventory than what's on display, so you can easily look up something on their website beforehand or ask someone there to help you. The browsing is the fun part, though; lots of old, weird stuff to be found.  The King's English (1511 1500 E)  This is in the 15th and 15th business district, which is also a fun little place to spend a couple hours. Stop by Caputo's market to get a nice sandwich beforehand (or you could try out Mazza next door, Mediterranean food and a local fave). This is an independent bookstore but it offers a selection akin to something like Barnes & Noble, only better curated. You can tell all the books have been selected with love and the folks there are amazing at giving recommendations. It's also just a great place to hang out: the shelves wind around this cute little house and there are lots of nooks and crannies where you can find a comfortable armchair and do some in-store reading if you wish.  Weller Book Works (607 Trolley Square) This is in Trolley Square, a mall that has a lot of potential but is usually pretty quiet. There is a Whole Foods there (that's an American experience, right?), a couple restaurants, and a pretty interesting collection of boutique shops. Weller Book Works is in the southwest corner of the main mall area and can be a little hard to find. Worth it, though, I think. It's got the coolest vibe of all the bookshops I've mentioned and a pretty great mix of new and used, plus an upstairs area for collectors if you want to just browse rare titles.  Ken Sanders Rare Books (268 S 200 E) To be honest, I haven't hit this place up yet, but I think I'd be remiss not to mention it as a local treasure. More along the antique/rare books side of the spectrum. This also brings you back into the main downtown area, near some of the piano bars and Broadway (300 S.), which is also fun to walk along for interesting shops, restaurants, and a cool indie movie theatre. I know there is a GREENbike bike-share outlet near there at 3rd South and 3rd East if you're interested in cycling the city.  Eborn (254 S Main) This is right on Main Street; it's worth exploring this area if you haven't yet. Eborn is probably the biggest and most sprawling of all the bookstores I've mentioned. The collection doesn't seem as well curated, it's just kind of huge. The interesting thing about Eborn is that they specialize in Utah/Mormon esoterica, but they also have a lot of fiction, classics, etc. for anyone wandering in.  I don't know a ton about pubs, but I would recommend going to Avenues Proper for local craft beer. They have an in-house brewery but also serve a lot of other local beers on tap (from Epic, Wasatch, Red Rock, Uinta). This also takes you up into the Avenues, a cute mostly residential neighborhood that is fun to walk around on a sunny day. From there, you'd be a short jaunt to Memory Grove Park (my favorite in the city) and the mouth of City Creek Canyon for a gentle hike.  I hope you have a great stay. Cheers!"
SaltLakeCity,36788a,HimselfTheMan,3,Sun May 17 15:56:41 2015 UTC,"You said climbing!

SaltLakeCity,36788a,slcjosh,2,Sun May 17 03:17:47 2015 UTC,"My favorite pub is Dick n Dixies. Give it a shot. Plenty of beers and whiskey. Friendly crowd and great staff.   Explore some of the canyons. Taken a drive up little cottonwood and hang out at snowbird ski resort. Lots of cool hikes and recreational stuff.   If you have the desire to watch some footy try to make it to a RSL game. Its not Premier League But Its high caliber and the 22,000 strong crowd is very into it.   If you guys want to get some gambling in take a 90 minute drive west and go to Wendover. All the gambling you can handle and it's cheap for industry standards.   Depending on your time there might be the Arts Festival happening as well and it is always a riot. Keep an eye out form the pride festival as well. The parade and festival are a riot.   Also keep an eye out for some of the concerts at Red Butte Gardens. There is a killer line up this spring and summer and tickets can be bought online or on the secondary market.   I hope you enjoy our city it truly is a great place. Just don't tell too many people we like being a very well kept secret."
SaltLakeCity,36788a,ajfa,1 point,Sun May 17 03:19:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for the ideas. I would've never thought of an American football game but actually that sounds so great. Get a hotdog and get really involved!  It's probably not the right season but I'm sure there's still something around similar I'll find.
SaltLakeCity,36788a,FeelTheWrath79,1 point,Sun May 17 09:58:21 2015 UTC,Actually RSL = standard football = soccer!  Utah is not particularly huge in American football -- the university games between Utah and BYU are as close as we get. Good thing too :)

SaltLakeCity,36788a,DawildWest,2,Sun May 17 16:51:55 2015 UTC,"You'll be able to do all of the things on your list :)  For beer, I recommend Beer Hive (downtown) and The Bayou (State St). In fact, that area around State St has lots of tattoo shops too.   It's easy to rent bikeshare bikes around town, but for a longer-term rental you might want to call a local bike shop and ask. Contender Cycles at 9th and 9th is quite nice -- I'm not sure if they'd know. Once you have your bike, pretty much anything on the east side near the mountains, up Emigration Canyon, or down south near LCC/BCC is heavenly.   Otherwise, rent a car and get yourself up in the canyons. It's still snowy in the Cottonwood Canyons, but Mount Olympus trail, Bonneville Shoreline Trail, and Frary Peak on Antelope Island are great this time of year."

SaltLakeCity,362vv4,Slcyuppie,28,Fri May 15 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"My buddy worked at the corporate office for the DABC. Here are some fun things he shared with me:   Utah is the single largest purchaser of alcohol in the USA. Because they purchase in such large bulk, they often have strong negotiation power (similar to how Wal*Mart can buy things for cheaper because they buy so much of it.) All prices (by law) are a fixed percentage over what they paid for it. As a result of these two things, you can find some wines and liquor in Utah stores for cheaper than out of state. I am not a big wine aficionado, but shared some pricing with me where prices of some wines in Utah can be 30-40% cheaper than in California, for example. Because of the fixed percentage that sets the price of items, holiday items that come bundled with cool stuff like glasses, shakers, etc., are the same price as the plain bottle itself. Liquor companies will send swag to the DABC. However, employees are not allowed to keep it. They throw it out. Dumpster diving, anyone?"
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,ex-mo-fo-sho,11,Fri May 15 18:44:06 2015 UTC,Dumpster diving   Is there a usual day of the month/week that they throw this stuff out or do you have to know someone who will tell you or just hang around the dumpster a lot?
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,Just_A_Dinosaur,3,Fri May 15 20:23:36 2015 UTC,For real! I'm game.
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,ceh1007,7,Fri May 15 23:33:42 2015 UTC,"I have lived in Washington state and Texas during holiday booze time, and the holiday gift boxes with tumblers, flasks, t-shirts whatever have always been the same price as the bottle.  Source: 99% of my glassware is from those boxes."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,maurosmane,3,Fri May 15 19:30:55 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely true, have seen this in California, Arizona, and Illinois. Sometimes it's even cheaper because it's on Special Promo."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,b_knickerbocker,2,Fri May 15 23:19:18 2015 UTC,"yep, costco at christmastime in nevada. great place to get those extras"
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,_JimmyJazz_,8,Fri May 15 23:39:06 2015 UTC,Some more fun facts:   as mentioned by /u/ex-mo-fo-sho the law requires the DABC to resale alcohol they purchase at a specific price above what the DABC bought it for. This is known as the markup. 10% of the markup goes to the school lunch program. 1% goes to public safety and must be used for funding alcohol-related enforcement officers. 0.6% goes to underage drinking prevention education and programs.
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,varthalon,11,Sat May 16 04:52:26 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, after learning what the mark up goes for, I have no issue with that.  Feeding kids, helping out under age drinking prevention, and public safety are all things I can get behind."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,BadLuckRabbitsFoot,4,Sat May 16 05:14:21 2015 UTC,"The thing to remember about earmarks like that, is that it doesn't necessarily increase the amount of money going to something like the school lunch program.  That money just doesn't need to come out of the general fund, so the general fund money can be spent wherever they want.  It's technically true, but if for example sales doubled one year school lunches wouldn't get better the next year... it'd just mean more money in the general fund.  Or at least that's my impression of how this sort of feel-good-appropriation often goes."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,Terazilla,3,Sat May 16 16:46:42 2015 UTC,Where does the other 88.4% go then?
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,srynearson1,2,Sat May 16 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"To pay the employees, pay the rent, pay the utilities, etc..  Keep in mind, that's 88.4% of the markup, not of the purchase price."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,MinimusNadir,2,Sat May 16 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"The rest goes into a fund that has three purposes:  1st - The DABC can use it to buy alcohol for resale.  2nd - What is left after that the legislature uses to fund the DABC's operating budget (salaries, overhead, etc) at the beginning of each fiscal year.  3rd - What is left over after that goes into the State's General Fund. The General fund is the State's main operating budget and is used to pay for most of the state programs, agencies, and employees. How the money in the general fund is used is determined each year with the annual budget legislation."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,varthalon,4,Sat May 16 18:56:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this makes a lot of sense as far as the pricing goes.  I've always thought that we had decent and even cheaper prices on spirits than some other states that I've traveled to."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,fickle_fuck,2,Fri May 15 19:16:50 2015 UTC,"It's funny you mention the swag, because the articles over the last few weeks went on about employees and managers improperly accepting gifts."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,puhnitor,2,Sat May 16 02:37:19 2015 UTC,"The only time I've noticed slightly cheaper prices is on single beers. It's like they don't know what they've got sometimes. Depending on the month, I've gotten a 4-pack of Rasputin for about $8. That'd be at least $10 anywhere else.  Wine and spirits, however, are at best the same price as everywhere else or a bit higher."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,b_knickerbocker,2,Fri May 15 23:21:13 2015 UTC,"rasputin, brother thelonius, the unibroue brand- are all pretty well priced here.  Sam adams, sierra nevada and euro imports like warsteiner are at least 2x what you'd pay in NV or CA"
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,_JimmyJazz_,7,Fri May 15 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"This may be because the law requires DABC to resell:   Wine and spirits from large manufacturers at AT LEAST 186% of what the DABC purchased it for. Wine and spirits from small manufacturers at exactly 147% of what the DABC purchased it for. Heavy beer from large manufacturers at exactly 164.5% of what the DABC purchased it for. Heavy beer from small manufacturers at exactly 130% of what the DABC purchased it for.   This means that the DABC can give you a better bargain on stuff made by the smaller manufacturers. Also, if you want to give as little money as possible to the State then a heavy beer from a small brewery is the way to go. Also, when the DABC is discontinuing an item they can sell it for below these required markups so look for discounted items."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,varthalon,5,Sat May 16 05:06:27 2015 UTC,"wow, that does explain it perfectly, thank you  I know it a technical term but it's so funny that Sam's Boston Lager or Warsteiner are called ""heavy"" beers."

SaltLakeCity,362vv4,Desmodromic1078,3,Sat May 16 01:12:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Beer is much more expensive at the liquor store. Want a 6 pack of Sam Adams? Better be ready to shell out $14. However, then they are cheaper for buying some of the high point squatters beers. An outer darkness (17%) is cheaper at the liquor store than it is at squatters.   Best thing to do? Know someone who can go up to hill and buy booze."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,Ceedub260,10,Sat May 16 04:22:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I keep telling people our liquor laws in this state have a zero to do with mormonism at this point, it has to do with the fact that the government is making a killing by holding a monopoly on it. It is shady as fuck on multiple levels."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,TaddWinter,21,Fri May 15 22:15:49 2015 UTC,"that doesn't explain the zion curtain, or 'ordering food', or number of drinks at once,  so I wouldn't say zero"

In terms of alcohol, its no coincidence that the state with the highest concentration of mormons also has the most ridiculous liquor laws."
SaltLakeCity,362vv4,ImDALEY,7,Sat May 16 01:13:09 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily the most ridiculous. There are places that still are completely ""Dry"". One of the best things to come with the ""ridiculousness"" of the DABC is that there is liquor available in every single Utah County. Maybe not as widely available as in Los Angeles, but that also has a lot to do with the fact that there's not as many people here."

SaltLakeCity,3646xc,stonguse,2,Sat May 16 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"Glad you've had better luck.  The last two times I've been it was similar.  When you accuse a patron of having a fake ID because they are from out of town it doesn't endear you to the customer.  It also is a profound level of incompetence for a bouncer to not know the difference between a valid ID and a fake one just because it is from another state.    Had it been a simple misunderstanding, that would be different.  The guy on the door was a complete asshole for no reason.  We were being courteous and were called liars and he threatened to have us thrown out and to seize the IDs.  We're all in our 30s and none of us looked even close to 21; the door monkey was being a dick simply because he could or he had a burr up his ass about out of town patrons.  Before that we were watching a film that was already out on disc.  The audience was rowdy, lots of side conversations going on and a few who thought they were guests on MST3K.  We walked out and bought the Blu-Ray to watch at home in peace.  I've been to theaters with children who were better behaved.  The beer and mediocre food isn't worth it.  Seriously, fuck Brewvies, I'm done with them."

Now it seems to have spread beyond those special events.  EDIT: I think it was a re-screening of Back to the Future."

SaltLakeCity,3646xc,LordPizzaParty,1 point,Sat May 16 18:10:00 2015 UTC,"The crowd stuff heavily depends on the movie/night I think. I've found the free movies tend have more noisy people at them, even if they aren't particularly suited for it. Maybe they divert their ticket money to alcohol or something.

SaltLakeCity,363wwt,f0rkboy,9,Fri May 15 22:16:34 2015 UTC,"Unincorporated is just that. It's not part of any city. No city taxes, but likewise the city doesn't take care of you, just the county.  Normally the county does a great job with snow removal and all that, but seeing as you're in a weird spot (as opposed to say, what cottonwood heights was before it incorporated), I can see why there are visible differences.  Basically, the snow plows that stopped are from sandy city, paid for by sandy city taxes and not the county or state. They won't help you because you don't pay them.  It's actually a very common thing, everywhere, you just don't normally notice it as it usually doesn't end up in those odd situations."
SaltLakeCity,363wwt,ryumast3r,2,Fri May 15 22:30:13 2015 UTC,"Cities get their money from sales tax, I'm sure OP does the majority of their purchases in Sandy."
SaltLakeCity,363wwt,bassshred,1 point,Sat May 16 23:42:52 2015 UTC,Then the obvious question: why bother keeping tiny islands of unincorporated land at all? Why doesn't Sandy just absorb all of the three streets in my neighborhood? It seems like it would save somebody some time and money.
SaltLakeCity,363wwt,TheBadWolf,8,Fri May 15 22:33:37 2015 UTC,"Right now they can't annex anymore unincorporated territory, the boundaries were frozen last year to allow for November's vote. Prior to that, the cities have been chipping away at the unincorporated county, Millcreek in particular.  The reason they haven't all been absorbed is either because the city can't justify the tax base, or the residents of the townships haven't approved it (have to get a certain percentage of approval per block)."
SaltLakeCity,363wwt,HatuutaH,2,Fri May 15 22:39:46 2015 UTC,"You can blame your new neighbors and the people who owned your house before still being in an unincorporated part of the valley.  Many people take governmental distrust to extremes here and rally to not have another layer of government (in this case a city) over them.   People also fear a valley-wide government, too and the machinations it took to get the Unified Fire and Police Departments were epic.  The upside is that you pay lower taxes;  the down side is that you don't have street lights,  have ever-weakening snow removal and sidewalks appear and disappear at random."
SaltLakeCity,363wwt,TheBadWolf,6,Sat May 16 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"Basically you can consider unincorporated SLCo to be its own city. The differences are exactly as you've laid out; instead of your city providing services, you're receiving services from the county.  In November you get to vote if you become a city or stay a township. If you become a city, you get the second option of creating your own services or continuing to contract with the county. You probably don't have the tax base to afford your own services."
SaltLakeCity,363wwt,varthalon,2,Fri May 15 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"/u/TheBadWolf are you talking about SB 199 - The Metro Township bill?  I would like to learn more about that bill. My impression is that letting the unincorporated 'islands' like /u/f0rkboy's form a single 'city' even though they aren't physically connected, is that correct? And while each separately doesn't have the tax base to support a city infrastructure, several of them united would?"
SaltLakeCity,363wwt,TheBadWolf,6,Sat May 16 03:58:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the one.   Some of the islands, not all of them, form a cohesive township called White City. I think the other islands that aren't part of the township will have the option of annexing into Sandy or remaining unincorporated.  All of the Sandy island together probably still don't have the tax base to survive on their own. I'm not very familiar with the area, but it would need to have some sort of decent commercial business development in order to survive alone. Millcreek and Kearns are the townships most likely to become cities, but even they probably won't because they'd need to raise taxes significantly.  /u/f0rkboy, here's the mayor's website about Community Preservation, which is the effort launched by SB199. Your local government services would be provided by the Salt Lake County Office of Township Services, and they'd be happy to answer these sorts of questions.  Most unincorporated residents are happy to stay unincorporated. Taxes are generally much lower than they are in the surrounding municipalities. The services are pretty good, too. The snow plow thing is weird, but as long as your driveway gets plowed in a reasonable time, I don't really think it would matter."
SaltLakeCity,363wwt,kolomana,2,Sat May 16 04:25:36 2015 UTC,"I probably live in your neighborhood, on the sandy side.   Nothing wrong with living in and getting services from the county, but there are noticeable differences between municipalities such as different infrastructure (Street lighting,  curb shapes, sidewalks and park strips,  snow removal, garbage collection, etc)  you'd see the same thing if you live on the border between any cities,  but it's especially noticeable in sandy because there are lots of little county pockets and they tend to have more dated infrastructure and fairly distinct differences from their sandy counterparts.     In some cases such as the Millcreek area citizens have gained signatures to have a ballot vote on forming their own city.   In your case the city of sandy would have to agree to take ownership of the county pockets and then annex those areas into the city.   This tends to happen over time but sometimes cities are reluctant to annex areas with poor and degrading infrastructure because it can be a liability not worth the additional tax revenue they may gain from the annexation."

I was planning on taking it to my favorite place, but opted for the Pep Boys on 700 E and 2100 S. the reason I did so was because I figured the chain shops will really find any and every problem with the car that needs fixing, no matter how critical. they ended up finding about $2k worth of issues (mostly front end and suspension) - nothing that was detrimental to the function of the vehicle; just basic maintenance and parts that needed replaced. anyhow, I haggled with the seller a bit and he dropped $1500 off the price he was selling the car for because of the issues it had. I did all the work myself for about $500 and saved $1000 on the car itself.   just my anecdotal experience, but I feel that if you take it to a chain where they are really trying to push you to fix everything, you'll wind up finding out a bit more about the car and maybe have some negotiating room on the price.   cheers!"

Crowbar open that wallet and be prepared to pay a pretty penny.  The city has tried multiple times to RDA the homeless shelters and soup kitchens out of existence and has failed every time.    It ain't going to happen unless the tax payer puts up the cash.
SaltLakeCity,36103b,Slcyuppie,2,Fri May 15 17:38:28 2015 UTC,We should not criminalize poverty and mental illness by not allowing people to beg.....and many homeless services here duplicate services rather than provide individual and unique services to help the population as a whole.

SaltLakeCity,36103b,rathulacht,8,Sat May 16 18:01:04 2015 UTC,"You're being hammered with downvotes, and I think that's because a lot of people have never lived in a place where homeless people are legally not allowed to beg and harass people.  Having spent a significant amount of time in NYC, I was blown away by the behavior of the homeless here. There are multiples more in NYC, but they cannot beg, they cannot harass, etc.  They are allowed to have signs, but that's about it.  Working downtown here, I've been hassled the entire walk to my car. Have had people question my response to not having any spare change. Have been yelled at, and cursed at, for saying no.   They are relentless, and for the people who actually have to deal with them on a daily basis, it's no shock to read a response like yours."
SaltLakeCity,36103b,TheBadWolf,2,Sat May 16 19:25:12 2015 UTC,This has been attempted.
SaltLakeCity,36103b,rathulacht,2,Sat May 16 18:00:21 2015 UTC,"Which is ridiculous.  The only people who reject this, don't have to deal with these people in any semblance of regularity.   I feel like a lot of the ""supporter and rights activists"" for these people, only take their view from a distance. (cue: housewives on the hill trying to ""help the impoverished."") If you never spend time walking around downtown proper, you have no clue how bad they actually are.  Hell, when I was a student at the U, I didn't even realize there even were homeless people in SLC. I think a lot of people in this town need to spend a week walking around the blocks between Rio Grande and the 4th South liquor store.   It's quite nerve-wracking how aggressive these people are. And, it's even more frustrating that their behavior is essentially supported."
SaltLakeCity,36103b,TheBadWolf,2,Fri May 15 22:24:55 2015 UTC,"Eh, I disagree. I deal with them pretty regularly. In fact I used to live a block from Pioneer Park, two blocks from the shelter. Some of them were aggressive, but it was rare. Now I'm a few further blocks east, but I still walk around downtown quite a bit.  I absolutely believe they have the First Amendment right to panhandle. If they become aggressive, you can call the police."
SaltLakeCity,36103b,rathulacht,2,Fri May 15 23:23:48 2015 UTC,"I deal with it daily.   In example, we have three parking lots at work, one of which is guys only, because of the constant complaints women had having to walk to the farthest lot- which is only a block.  I don't disagree with the idea of panhandling though. It's just the way it's done here is out of control. NYC has it down though. You can have a sign. That's it. Begging and any aggressive actions are illegal, and actually enforced. You walk around NYC and they don't speak to you. It's nice.  If you feel like giving, you can. You don't have to get intimidated into doing so.  As far as calling the police, I don't have the time for that. I have things to do; not sit around in my car, waiting for a cop who really has better things to do than slap the wrist of some pissed off vagrant."

My coworkers and I do notice, however, that some of us experience it much differently than others. Most of us walk around the area, taking public transit and what not. Some if us get flat out yelled at nearly every day, others hardly at all. There's definitely a correlation between the bad experiences and size/gender/perceived level of income with my coworkers, though."

Never forget the homeless are people too who have their own stories. Most individuals who are homeless and living on the street have mental illnesses. So the real question is how do we provide them with access to services and treatment to get them off the street? You can't put a band-aid on this problem....

SaltLakeCity,363hfu,oussan,9,Fri May 15 20:04:39 2015 UTC,"In California, you were much closer to the ocean.  Being near a large body of water tends to keep the temperature much more stable than it otherwise would be for the terrain.  Also, you may not have been at altitude, mountains have interesting hands in creating and affecting weather.  There's also humidity.  You've probably noticed than an air-conditioned house at 72 feels quite different (and colder!) than a house at 72 cooled either by outside air, or by a swamp cooler.  It's because the air-conditioned air is dryer.  Depending on where you were at, you may have dealt with higher (and more consistent) humidity, and Utah's dry air may be a bit wild for you."
SaltLakeCity,363hfu,MinimusNadir,2,Fri May 15 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"I think you're correct on all accounts. I lived in Monterey, which is kind of its own little micro-climate - right on the coast, beset by fog almost every night, and considerably cooler than the areas that surround it. I used heating in the winter, but the summers were cool enough that I rarely ever wanted AC (and didn't have it to begin with).  I've actually lived in Utah since the 90s, but as I find myself switching my home HVAC between heating and cooling lately, I was just reflecting on how AC wasn't even necessary in Monterey. It just seems a bit crazy that I can't even go a few days here in the springtime without adjusting the thermostat!"
SaltLakeCity,363hfu,dmarie229,1 point,Fri May 15 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"I used to alternate quite a bit during spring and fall, but after living in Texas for a few years and getting so used to the heat I'll just set the A/C to 75 and let it do it's job.  Rarely does it kick on until about June."
SaltLakeCity,363hfu,varthalon,1 point,Fri May 15 20:39:52 2015 UTC,"I think there are a number of other factors that regulate home temperature as well, including building materials, windows, and trees. I live in a new home with modern building materials, lots of windows, and tiny little trees that are too young to provide shade. When I lived in Historic Sandy (in a 1922 Craftsman Bungalow) we had mature trees that were much taller than our home, and our swamp cooler was able to keep up with the weather except on very hot days. But when it was 80 degrees and 80 percent humidity inside the house, we were wishing for central air!"
SaltLakeCity,363hfu,bit2much,3,Fri May 15 20:47:09 2015 UTC,Utah is a high altitude desert which have some of the greatest variation of temperature over the course of a diurnal cycle. Air is a natural insulation. The high altitude means we have a less 'thick' blanket of air over us to insulate us from heating quickly during the day and loosing the heat at night. Even more we are impacted because our air is so dry. Moisture in air makes it an even better insulator. Low levels of moisture means direct sunlight heats the air/ground quicker during the day and that heat escapes much quicker at night as well.

SaltLakeCity,361f11,varthalon,2,Fri May 15 13:37:08 2015 UTC,"I recommend Canyonlands, Bryce, and Zions National Park.  Also near Moab is Dead Horse Point State Park, which you probably don't want to stay in as the lookout point and a few trails is about all they offer.  If you're going to camp, try to reserve in advance.  Near Salt Lake City, I recommend going up to Snowbird and riding the tram.  They also have a lot of nice restaurants and lodging.  Be sure to check out the Natural History Museum of Utah."
SaltLakeCity,361f11,pashdown,1 point,Fri May 15 12:59:06 2015 UTC,"Moab is awesome. Arches should definitely be on the top of your list. Don't forget what we have up north too. Uinta mountain range is beautiful, and Jackson Hole in WY, with Teton and Yellowstone National Parks nearby, is closer than a lot of stuff in southern Utah."
SaltLakeCity,361f11,Malatesta721,1 point,Fri May 15 14:32:40 2015 UTC,"Teton and Yellowstone would only be closer than the most remote areas of Southern Utah.  From South Jordan, it's about 45 minutes to an hour longer drive to Teton than it is to Zion, Arches or Canyonlands.  Edit:  Not to discourage anyone from going to see the Tetons or Yellowstone (I'm going myself this summer) -- they're just not closer than Utah's national parks."
SaltLakeCity,361f11,agilla,2,Fri May 15 15:06:48 2015 UTC,"You're right, didn't realize OP mentioned South Jordan. I guess it's just closer for me since I live on the northern end of SLC and have most of my friends in Bountiful-Ogden areas. It's just 4 hours and 15 minutes to Jackson for me, and 5 hours 15 minutes to Canyonlands Needles district for example, where I'm going this weekend. Zion is further away for me too.    Uintas are still close though! Timpanogos Cave is also close by and worth seeing."

Go to temple square, the capitol, and the pioneer park. This will help you get familiar with Utah and its culture. Then hike to the living room. If you have time, go to Park City and see the Olympic village. Also visit Timpanogos Cave. My group will be planning trips to Moab, Zion, The Great Salt Lake, and  the Salt Flats this summer.

New York Steak from Red Rock, it comes with a carby side and vegetables, just substitute the carby side with more vegetables. Blue Plate Diner has omelettes that you can order a la carte. Greek omelette from The Other Place, substitute hash browns for tomatoes, and subsitute the carby side for cottage cheese.

Go to any burger place and get the burger lettuce wrapped (The Habit and Tonyburger are great).

SaltLakeCity,360j5e,paradoxymormon,2,Fri May 15 12:42:25 2015 UTC,"IMO Habit Burger has the best low carb burgers. In-N-Out is a close second but the avocado option from Habit edges them out.   Harmon's City Creek had a good salad bar. One of the few of any downtown that has bacon you can add to get that high fat.   If you want to skirt the edge, a carne Asada burrito from Alberto's is good if you have the willpower to not eat the tortilla.   I heard Whole Foods was doing BPC but I just make my own so I couldn't tell you for sure. Sugar house coffee offers a BPC though.   R&R is good if you can resist the bbq sauce. I splurged a few times there and wasn't kicked out of ketosis though.   I'm sure as a keto eater who is also on Reddit, you already know about the lettuce wraps at Jimmy John's but I'll throw that out there.   Finally my favorite, low carb salad at Greek Souvlaki with gyro meat and blue cheese.   Sorry for the wall o'text. Those are most of the places that got me by."

SaltLakeCity,3607cc,nadroj007,11,Fri May 15 00:03:34 2015 UTC,Meatball gets my vote.
SaltLakeCity,3607cc,Luxzin,3,Fri May 15 01:12:58 2015 UTC,"It's gotta be the Meatball and here's why. Moochies has big subs with lots of bread. The meatball sub is a sizable portion of meatballs but it's the marinara sauce that makes it. Say you go to subway and get one of their meatball subs. The marinara eventually soaks too much into the bread and it just falls apart on you. But with the higher bread content, it soaks up the marinara and still holds itself together and you hit that perfect balance of awesome saucy bread that isn't disintegrating in your hands as you enjoy those deliciousness.   Now, apply this to the Cheese Steak. Not as much sauce to soak into the excess bread. Bread to filler content no bueno, even though they give you a sizable amount of the cheese steak stuff.  I haven't tried anything else on their menu, so I can't speak for anything else."

The local commerce is mostly low-end groceries and such, though, so no night life or other city attractions despite being in the city. It's on the TRAX and just minutes from the airport and from downtown. If you want a monthly rate you can't reserve it ahead of time; you just show up and pick a spot.  Mountain Shadows is in Draper right on I-15. I had an OK time there but witnessed some ugly confrontations. Once they called a tow truck on some guy who just parked in a spot for a half hour; didn't even give him a warning.

Let's take about a third of that away for taxes just to be safe: $40,600 per year. Let's bump your rent budget up to $1,000, just to give us some wiggle room; that means you're paying $12,000 per year on rent, leaving you with $28,600 for everything else. Most people spend about 30% of their income on rent or housing, and you're pretty well below that. You'll be fine as long as you're not spending a ton of money on transportation.

We paid a little over $1000 in rent and were still putting 20% of our net income in savings and had plenty of money to eat out sometimes, see movies, etc.  We do only have one small, inexpensive car, though, and lived close to the U that whole time. That cuts a decent amount of our expenses off, since we both had free UTA passes from the U and didn't drive much. If you have to have 2 cars or commute way down to one end of the valley everyday, you'll incur higher transportation costs.

I'd imagine most people performing their own maintenance working on projects would do so after work, but they always closed at 6 or something.   Somebody should retry this with a viable model; maybe have 3 or 4 bays, not a whole warehouse, and let it run into the night. Basically the bike collective but for cars; that would be great."

We got 2 types of people that came in the 1-2 hour jobs, brakes and oil changes or we got the weekenders who had a decent amount of money but wanted to do it themselves. Neither of which paid the bills.   You have to have the full service auto shop portion to make your rent payments and business costs. The DIY portion is just a cherry on the cake."

There was some paint that rubbed off on my car that was there when I bought it and the dude ran inside and grabbed a bottle of what I assume was magic. He put a little bit on a towel and lightly rubbed the spot out in seconds. I left it with them and got it a few hours later. Came out really well done. I will have to do it again here in the next few months after it stops raining and the pollen slows down. Not sure who I will go with though.

SaltLakeCity,35tvs3,Qurtys_Lyn,2,Wed May 13 16:09:26 2015 UTC,Royal India and Bombay House are some of my tops. I would suggest trying Himalayan Kitchen if you haven't as well. Their goat curry is my favorite if your up for goat but most things I've had there are good.

SaltLakeCity,35tvs3,saulgold,4,Thu May 14 02:52:38 2015 UTC,"Koko kitchen, best Japanese food anywhere, unless you want sushi then head to Takashi. Skewered Thai is the best curry I've had and for as much as I dislike Piper Down the bangers and mash there is amazing."

Their food is decent and cheap and they have beer.   IMO the best Japanese food in the city is either Takashi, Naked Fish, or Kyoto. Depends on what you order."
SaltLakeCity,35tvs3,WahhTahh,1 point,Wed May 13 20:11:55 2015 UTC,"For sushi, Takashi is great, and same for Naked Fish.  Kyoto is good but honestly can be really hit or miss, and doesn't have nearly the same range of authentic Japanese as Koko.  In my opinion."

SaltLakeCity,35tvs3,phantomtofu,10,Wed May 13 15:43:49 2015 UTC,Neilson's Frozen Custard on Highland and 39th. Great stuff. Their location in Bountiful also used to do sandwiches. Don't know if they still do though.  Iceberg for a classic shake though of course.
SaltLakeCity,35tvs3,caligari87,2,Wed May 13 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"Bountiful still has the sandwiches; they're way better than they should be (iceberg lettuce, american cheese, white bread, somehow still excellent).   At Highland get the spiced apple in the fall, add pecans and heath. I have tried every combination they offer (I worked there for seven years) and that one's the best. Honorable mention goes to chocolate raspberry brownie when they have the good brownies (supplier is inconsistent)."
SaltLakeCity,35tvs3,paradoxymormon,2,Wed May 13 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"Iceberg is great, I usually hit the one on Redwood and 54th when I have a few extra bucks to spare."
SaltLakeCity,35tvs3,Clotele,7,Wed May 13 16:36:48 2015 UTC,"I have to second the vote for Sapa (7th S and State). My coworkers and I go there for lunch often and are never disappointed. We have never had a long wait or bad service, and the food is awesome. There are really good lunch prices on rolls and bento boxes, but the dinner prices are worth it for signature dishes like their beef massaman (which is super tasty and gorgeously plated). So much yes.  Tosh's Ramen is also a go-to. The hours are unpredictable and inconvenient at times, the wait can be long, but the ramen is so so good.  Moochie's for sandwiches & fries. Hire's for burgers & shakes. And this is going to sound unconventional, but I actually love eating at the City Creek Harmon's grocery store. They have the BEST chocolate croissants at the bakery, plus you can mosey downstairs to the deli and get a good slice of pizza, some tasty mac 'n' cheese, or house-made soup with a fresh roll. There's also a great DIY salad bar and I love wandering over to the cold beverages and picking up a local soda (the Brigham's Brew root beer is delish). You can get a pretty stellar meal for around $5 and walk it upstairs to eat in their cafe or outside in the sunshine."

Ultimately Cafe Rio is my default because I'm lazy.
SaltLakeCity,35tvs3,sessafresh,3,Wed May 13 18:09:18 2015 UTC,Cafe Rio is amazing. Don't listen to anyone that tells you otherwise.

They're only open M-F (and I think late on Saturdays??) and usually there's a line out the door at lunch time, but it's worth the wait. 311 Main St. Lamb's Grill for breakfast or lunch and Eva's for Sunday Brunch are also fantastic. Ekamai Thai downtown (and Sugarhouse) is also superb. The Chow Truck when it's nearby is wonderful.  Someone else mentioned it, but Gourmandise for lunch is great.

Unfortunately its is inconsistent, I learned that it is an older lady that comes in and makes it daily for them. Sometimes it has got some awesome flavor and a good bite to it. Other times it is a bit bland and not very spicy.  La Fountain (the one on 2300 E 2700 S) has some pretty decent salsa. Red Iguana's is alright, but ask for the spicier stuff and stir it into the regular.   Hectors (Molca Salsa) has the best fast food salsa there is. Used to have him fill up a bottle I could take home."

SaltLakeCity,35vlyw,CptnMcFlustered,4,Wed May 13 21:51:30 2015 UTC,Where you interested in any minerals specifically? I've been in quite a few of the abandoned mines around here.  You might also see if you can get in touch with the Mojave Underground if you can. Though they seem to have been inactive for over a year now.
SaltLakeCity,35vlyw,wtmh,2,Wed May 13 23:07:23 2015 UTC,I'm mostly interested in the ore minerals. I would just like to find some nice sized and nicely formed samples to study and have for my mineral collection... haha. But I will definitely see into that!
SaltLakeCity,35vlyw,wtmh,3,Thu May 14 00:01:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the chances of you finding rich ore just sitting on the ground in a mine are somewhere in the area of zero. Unless mines tailings are going to do it, you'd basically have to go into a mine, find a vein (fat chance – there's a reason the mine was abandoned.) and try to remove it.   And I would very strongly tell you to not go into an inactive mine and disturb it by smacking the walls more then two feet inside the portal."
SaltLakeCity,35vlyw,wtmh,1 point,Thu May 14 00:10:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that, I'm more looking for the tailings/dumps to look through. I'm fine with pretty small samples and you never know what you will find.  And I just replied to another comment about how I will NOT be entering any mine tunnels or shafts. Ha, I guess I better do an edit."

SaltLakeCity,35vlyw,realbells,3,Thu May 14 12:48:35 2015 UTC,"Mining engineer here. If you want to learn about old mines in Utah, there are three things you should look into: ""From the Ground Up: A History of Mining in Utah"" is the most comprehensive book on Utah mining history, and it will tell you about some of the old mining operations in the areas you're invested in. ""Treasure House: The Utah Mining Story"" is a PBS documentary on the same subject. Finally, download Google Earth and then get the PLSGE file from here. This will plot the Township and Range system over Google Earth's images. Find the TS&R section and subsection coordinates for the areas you're interested, then go to the BLM's website and search for old mining patents by TS&R. Follow the patents to find the old mines."
SaltLakeCity,35vlyw,realbells,1 point,Thu May 14 03:24:41 2015 UTC,"Can I find ""From the Ground Up"" at the Utah Department of Natural Resources? I actually bought a book called the Geology, Ore Deposits, and History of the Big Cottonwood Mining District along with maps that was published in 1979 which has been extremely insightful about the mining history, just not the up-to-date info I really wanted. But I will definitely look into the Utah Mining Story and check out the BLM's website."
SaltLakeCity,35vlyw,wtmh,1 point,Thu May 14 05:06:15 2015 UTC,"I got that book through a Utah mining history course at the U, so it's possible they've got a copy in their library. If not, you can buy it online through Barnes and Noble."

Unless that street has a way too low posted limit, and given that this is Utah I doubt that, then 49 in a 35 is definitely reckless, and OP should be thankful he wasn't charged with it."

Worst that happens is nothing changes and you're where you're at now. Best case, it gets lowered or dropped. Own up, and pay the ticket. You chose to speed pretty aggressively... gotta pay to play.   Real talk though, if residents are complaining about speeding cars, that means they feel people drive too fast for a reason. Doing 50 through a residential zone is pretty reckless on your behalf."

I really love relaxing on 15th and 15th in the evenings; you can get a nice sandwich at Caputo's and wander around The King's English bookstore. The staff there is really friendly, and I actually made a friend once while going to one of their book events; she and I got to chatting while waiting in line for an author signing and we ended up going out for drinks/pizza together afterwards.  The vibe at Brewvies is really chill. It's a cinema pub, so you can see a movie while eating/drinking anything from their menu, plus they have free pool in the afternoons.

Yet it's okay for you to be prescribed medical drugs that have more opiates in them than street heroin, that KILL!  Guess what else is addictive besides the prescribed drugs your doctor gives you. Let's rattle a handful. Sex, alcohol, porn, soda, sugar, shopping, fast food, exercise, etc. There are just people that are more prone to be addictive to basically anything. Utah has one of the highest numbers of deaths related to prescription drugs. I've known 7 people close to me in last 11 years that have died from prescription drugs. This doesn't even count the people I know that are still addicted. I have 2 debilitating diseases and one genetic disorder that are painful beyond words. I refuse to take pain pills. Marijuana helped me gain weight. Try throwing up every single day from consistent nausea. It's the only thing that kept me from puking upon waking up. Not to mention the pain relief was astounding.   Everything has side effects. Marijuana just had very, very little.   If you're against marijuana then you have not fully done your research."

More likely, any tax on marijuana would be split between the health department (for addition prevention education and addition rehabilitation programs) and public safety (for law enforcement related to administering the law) similar to how the beer tax revenue is divided.  edit: I just read the original bill and it was just going to be subject to regular sales tax.

The San Rafael Swell is closer also, but not as user friendly as Canyonlands and Arches. But it is free! The slot canyons near Goblin Valley (Little Wild Horse, Bell) would give you what you want. But the drive is about the same as the Moab parks.  My #1 place for tourists from outside of Utah is Zion, but that's not a day drive. Sad too, since it's so utterly awesome."

It is a biased article because most people in Utah county would agree that the canyon is too small and too precious to develop. Utah county doesn't have as many canyons as SL does, and it really is a treasure to those of us from the area. You're welcome to go explore it yourself, there is a $6 fee for 3 days."

Haven't ever done Donut Falls, but Cecret Lake is a pretty mild hike. Coming from Boise the altitude shouldn't be too rough on you, but as qpdbag said - take it slow if you start getting tired.  You can start the Cecret Lake hike from the base of Alta or IIRC you can head up the road a little further to some campgrounds and start from there (cuts a mile or two off the hike). Most the hike is just mild slopes the whole way, then some switch backs as you reach the lake. Keep your eyes open for wildlife - the two times I've done that hike in the summer I've encountered a moose, once with a calf."

Usually now you pay for the print rights, plus scanned images if it's film, and order prints yourself. But other than that it's not too crazy."
SaltLakeCity,35un4i,MinimusNadir,1 point,Wed May 13 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"Without knowing specifics, it could go either way.  Photography is priced very individually, every photog does it differently.  Some will charge you a lot for taking the pictures, and give you cheap prints, some will charge little or nothing for the shoot, and make it up in the cost of prints.  I'll go out on a limb and guess that this was the official event photographer, and they took shots of everyone who walked.  In such cases, not uncommonly, they got the job by offering the school the largest kickback from the services, so that will be factored into your pricing.  Also, they did the setup, shoot, and post for free, and now need to make it up in prints.  Furthermore, I imagine that a relatively small percentage of people actually buy them, so they need to make their money from the few who will.  Then, they have a lot of overhead to pay for - time that they don't have gigs, taxes, health insurance, gear replacement, software costs, etc..  There's a lot more cost in being a photographer than most people realize.  Overall, their base prices seem a bit high to me, but not necessarily egregious.  But when you look at any sort of upgrade (pearlized paper, more prints, etc.), they sure are pretty proud of their work.  Charging an extra $30 for pearlized paper is a pretty steep hit when it bumps their cost up extremely little.  Overall, you're probably stuck with them, so in the end, you just have to decide if it's worth it to you or not."
SaltLakeCity,35un4i,DawildWest,2,Wed May 13 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"they got the job by offering the school the largest kickback from the services   Yeah. That was my guess as well.   I imagine that a relatively small percentage of people actually buy them   This is what I was actually thinking. If they had a price which was viable for most students, then a lot of people would have bought the photographs. In such a scenario they can profit by having high volume, instead of trying to profit by high margins."

SaltLakeCity,35nnf2,dicksfish,0,Tue May 12 13:31:42 2015 UTC,Why won't SLC or the county take restrictive action like Lehi? It's impressive that a Utah county city could be so conservative while SLC is not.

SaltLakeCity,35sl9k,TheGarp,-1,Wed May 13 17:33:53 2015 UTC,"Taking the money normally spent on licensing and permits and putting it in your pocket while the competition cannot, is not progress. Let's see how compatitive they are when they have to pay the same fes or when regular cabbies dont. This is just using a phone for dispatch and gypsy cabbing. They are not accountable to the government and public they are only accountable to a private company y, which now by definition a criminal organization."
