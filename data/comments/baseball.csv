baseball,3e0ua5,CeeBeast,311,Tue Jul 21 02:20:52 2015 UTC,It still looks hilarious. The bad spin isn't that clear so it seems as if he's just standing in the wrong spot and not even trying to move.

baseball,3e0ua5,arsredneck,25,Tue Jul 21 17:47:25 2015 UTC,You can tell by the way it comes off the bat that it's spinning sideways like a top. It kicks so hard left when it hits the grass that it looks like the ball landed right on the seam and dug in harder when it landed.
baseball,3e0ua5,luxitania,55,Tue Jul 21 07:01:08 2015 UTC,"Of course, but that isn't immediately evident."
baseball,3e0ua5,Gravel_and_Glass,4,Tue Jul 21 07:09:19 2015 UTC,"For some reason darts like this coming to first base are always nasty. Even if they aren't hit hard they always do weird stuff coming off of the tip of the bat like that.   It's really difficult to read those, but not even attempting to turn around and figure out if he needs to be a relay man or if their's a shot at an out at first is really silly."
baseball,3e0ua5,JustinClarkv1,3,Tue Jul 21 08:27:07 2015 UTC,"I always hated the hit to 3B that you knew was going to be in that weird spot where you couldn't make up your mind to charge it, or step back.

Like he didn't even boot it, it didn't go through his legs...he got himself set to field the ball and it went 3 feet to his right and he didn't even move.    Like you said he didn't have any play on the ball, but it looks pretty funny considering what happened next."

baseball,3e0ua5,vertigo1083,46,Tue Jul 21 06:40:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you are joking or not, but this would definitely go down as a hit. You have to make contact with the ball on a ""routine"" play for it to be an error.   EDIT: What I said is just going to cover 90% of errors. I know it is not the textbook definition of error, but I also wasn't 100% on the textbook definition so thank you to people who pointed that out. The MLB definitely has a better rules when it comes to errors than whoever scores my college games haha."
baseball,3e0ua5,PitcherOnly,71,Tue Jul 21 08:22:30 2015 UTC,"That's a good general rule, but if for example a soft chopper just goes right between your legs, you will more often than not get charged with an error."

baseball,3e0ua5,aztech101,7,Tue Jul 21 12:58:30 2015 UTC,"Technically it's any play where a defensive player makes a mistake in the opinion of the official scorer (using ""ordinary effort"" as a baseline) that aids the offense.  ex: You hit me a pop up and I drop it, and you end up on first base. If the official scorer determines that with ordinary effort I should have caught the ball, then the play is scored as an error (an error will count the same statistically for the batters average as if he got out on the play). If the scorer determined that, for some reason, it would take more than ordinary effort for me to have caught your fly ball, then he will award the batter with a hit.  Ultimately, either way you end up on first base, so it's more for statistical reasons."

baseball,3e0ua5,propernounTHEheel,11,Tue Jul 21 05:52:18 2015 UTC,"He does have his stick, it's just the angle that makes it hard to see. He's holding it with his left hand and it's blocked by his legs for most of the clip, but you see it through his legs right at the end. Even without a stick, there are things players can do defensively. But anyway, it's the perspective that makes him seem closer to the play than he was. The rest of the team defense fell apart, it wasn't his fault."

baseball,3e0ua5,Death_Star_,8,Tue Jul 21 05:38:14 2015 UTC,"The puck is visible through the entire clip, except briefly when it's shot into the net.  Anyway, what it's trying to show is number 8, who comes in at the bottom left at the end of the clip. He's just gliding casually back, seemingly not even trying to help on defense. You expect to see some hustle. Seeing it from another angle shows you how far he actually is when it happens, whereas the perspective of OP's version makes him seem pretty close. This goal isn't actually his fault, it just looks bad.  For some more context, number 8 is Alex Ovechkin. He's considered the best goal scorer in the NHL right now, and one of the best goal scorers of all-time, but he has a reputation for playing poorly on defense (which he dispelled somewhat this year).

On the other hand I am firmly against steroids and think the way that you discourage the greats from participating is show there are consequences. Will the trouts and harpers of the worlds start juicing if it risks their legacy?"
baseball,3e38ew,zapyou42,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:34 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting question. There's never been legitimate confirmation on this, but most people believe Bonds started juicing when he realized how much the home run race was overshadowing his own achievements. So for Harper or Trout to start, their egos would have to be significantly bigger and other, greater talents would have to come along."
baseball,3e38ew,BurnedOut_ITGuy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:09:05 2015 UTC,That's not really the point.  The point is Bonds example might keep a Harper or Trout from juicing.

baseball,3e38ew,jigokusabre,5,Tue Jul 21 17:29:00 2015 UTC,"There's a very strong undercurrent of ""back in my day"" in both veterans and older writers. Everyone wants to think that the players you saw as a ten year old were the most upstanding and talented men ever to play the game. This is a natural bias. The steroid controversy plays directly into this narrative. No one has to admit that they, as players or as writers, weren't experiencing the game at the pinnacle of play if they can figure out a way to discredit the best players or the next generation."
baseball,3e38ew,Im_Daydrunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:38 2015 UTC,"Players know what about the life and pressure of a professional athlete, and they know how prevalent PED usage was/is and they know how little it had to do with Bonds/Clemens' greatness.

baseball,3e38ew,GraemeTaylor,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:11 2015 UTC,My real issue is the 'picking and choosing'. I'm sure most of the guys in the hall from that era were using some sort of PEDs but they pick out the obvious or well-known examples and choose to exclude them despite being some of the greatest players we have ever seen. It makes little to no sense and is somehow making the sport look worse than if they would just vote in Barry and company.

Bonds had a second Peak at his age 35-39 season, maybe the greatest peak ever. Then when you consider he did it ten years after the average players prime, you knew what he did was totally unnatural.   I love watching what he and the other juicers were able to do with modern medicine, but it was a complete sham and made a mockery of a lot of records. Doesn't mean he's any worse as a Person than the guys who cheated and took Greenies, just that he took the most effective PED."

baseball,3e2qxk,YourCummyBear,16,Tue Jul 21 14:49:57 2015 UTC,As a tigers fan what are realistic expectations for price or cespedes?
baseball,3e2qxk,thrownoutta,22,Tue Jul 21 15:27:39 2015 UTC,"It's tough to say. Both Price and Cespedes arguably are having career years, so the value is high. Bullpen pieces, SPs, young, speedy outfielders are what we need to compete with the Royals. We have lots of talent, but with the loss of Porcello, Scherzer, Fister (c.2013) and Verlander, we need SPs. Just to think, two years ago the Tigers went the entire year using only 6 SPs. I think we surpassed that in June this year.   *I'm counting Verlander as a loss because, c'mon, look at what he's done since he's been back. I have faith in him, but he won't be the 2011 Verlander ever again."
baseball,3e2qxk,razelbagel,11,Tue Jul 21 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"In your opinion, does Jose De Leon, Zach Lee, and Alex Guerrero get it done for Price?

baseball,3e2qxk,YouDidYourBest,2,Tue Jul 21 16:46:03 2015 UTC,I like this but I have to wonder how much Price's offer spikes since you guys would also be losing the opportunity to extend him a qualifying offer which would make him even more valuable to teams in the off season when he has no 1st round pick compensation attached. If he were sent to the Dodgers I could imagine he would be extended ASAP
baseball,3e2qxk,parst,5,Tue Jul 21 17:35:27 2015 UTC,Nobody trying to rebuild for next year has any interest in Alex Guerrero because of that opt out clause
baseball,3e2qxk,razelbagel,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:12 2015 UTC,"Except he's already said he won't opt out if he's guaranteed a starting position. And an AL team with the DH will have an easier time accommodating that. And realistically, he'll never sign a contract close to what he has now if he opts out having only been a part time player that watched his numbers drop dramatically when going from pinch hitter to semi regular starter."
baseball,3e2qxk,ExplainsSocialEnigma,5,Tue Jul 21 17:22:08 2015 UTC,Except he's already said he won't opt out if he's guaranteed a starting position.   And that guarantee is worthless without a renegotiation of the contract
baseball,3e2qxk,parst,6,Tue Jul 21 17:50:09 2015 UTC,Eh I call bullshit on that.  That's a huge amount of leverage to give up.
baseball,3e2qxk,AlaskanWinters,3,Tue Jul 21 17:27:15 2015 UTC,We have too many DH types as it is
baseball,3e2qxk,STNbrossy,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:30 2015 UTC,He's also been slumping pretty badly since his crazy april. Not sure why anyone would guarantee him a starting spot.
baseball,3e2qxk,razelbagel,2,Tue Jul 21 18:32:48 2015 UTC,"Right but that's also a reason he might not opt out. He is currently guaranteed 7.5 million for each of the next two years. He won't come anywhere close to that if he opts out as a .240 hitter that hasn't proven he can play every day. He'll get signed to a small deal and sent to the minors.  There is a case for both opting out and not, and it's basically made his trade value worthless, but hes got potential. Guerrero is really in a tough spot. No room for him on his current team and no trade value due to that clause, so he may be willing to renegotiate that clause.  And De Leon is the prize of the trade I proposed for Price anyway."

He was only drafted a year ago and is moving fast within the system, plus he's reportedly the first name asked about when the Giants have trade talks. He's definitely desirable"
baseball,3e2qxk,Im_Daydrunk,4,Tue Jul 21 17:40:16 2015 UTC,"He's good, but he's not on the same level as some of the guys they could easily get for Price. It would take something better than Beade, Susac and some random bullpen prospect to get Price since he's the best guy on the Market. I don't even know if the Giants have good enough prospects to pull a trade like this without emptying their entire farm system."
baseball,3e2qxk,gibsonlespaul,4,Tue Jul 21 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"I realize I didn't source my claim, so here is that. I don't know, Susac is viewed around the league as a pretty good major league caliber catcher with 5 years of control left, and he'd be a huge upgrade over Avila. And Beede is going to be highly regarded mark my words. But maybe I'm overvaluing my own prospects...at the same time, it's only for half a guaranteed year of Price. So maybe we'd throw a wild card in like Kyle Crick as well."

baseball,3e2qxk,Im_Daydrunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:08 2015 UTC,"I wasn't doubting your claim but to be fair the Giants farm system isn't exactly chock full of great prospects. You're comparing Beade to the rest of the Giants prospects, who he's better than, instead of other farm systems best prospects with whom he can't match up with yet.   Susac is good but honestly he seems a little overrated. Looking at his stats, he's barely over .300 OBP, his average is mediocre and that's all with a .343 BABIP which is pretty high. Not to mention he has like 30% K percentage which is awful if you are not a top slugging player or a guy like Joc who also walks a ton. His defense is also rated negatively by fangraphs. It helps he's only 25 but most guys don't magically become way better at that age. They might see improvements in some categories but usually a player doesn't change drastically in their playing style.  Half a season of a top 5 pitcher is plenty valuable, he could be a major game changer in the playoffs for a contender."
baseball,3e2qxk,STNbrossy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:34 2015 UTC,I like Susac a lot but he's only sitting at 200 career at bats so not sure how teams would value him.

baseball,3e2qxk,slorebath,13,Tue Jul 21 16:10:30 2015 UTC,They're super super similar. The thing that might put Price ahead is the arm he throws with.

baseball,3e2qxk,slorebath,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:55 2015 UTC,Price is striking out a little more and walking fewer. But I wouldn't consider him having all that much better of a season.
baseball,3e2qxk,jtheil,7,Tue Jul 21 16:21:07 2015 UTC,True. Would you rather have Cueto or Price?

baseball,3e2qxk,thrownoutta,4,Tue Jul 21 16:08:51 2015 UTC,Price is definitely worth more than Cueto.
baseball,3e2qxk,Leraeniesh,3,Tue Jul 21 16:39:04 2015 UTC,"Price is worth way more than Cueto. Cueto has been prone to injury this season, along with some major control problems. Price is healthy, and is showcasing his outstanding control."
baseball,3e2qxk,Randy_Roughhouse,0,Tue Jul 21 17:07:47 2015 UTC,"You're obviously not biased.    Cueto had one injury issue that set him back a start but came back and pitched fine, including an 11 strikeout CGSO against the Nats.  And he's only had one game with ""major control problems"" which was his most recent effort so not sure where you're getting that.

baseball,3e2qxk,Footballvike81,8,Tue Jul 21 16:33:05 2015 UTC,Very few of the Tigers main core were brought up through the system. They might be better off building through trade or FA.
baseball,3e2qxk,jimmy_three_shoes,5,Tue Jul 21 15:56:47 2015 UTC,"That's because we've been trading away the farm for years to build through Trades/FA.  What worries me is that the prospects we've been trading away haven't done much in terms of MLB production.  It's good on paper (just look at the trade that brought Miggy to Detroit) when it looks like Dombrowski fleeced another GM, but it also means that our scouting and drafting isn't good when our top-10 prospects never pan out."
baseball,3e2qxk,Footballvike81,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:27:17 2015 UTC,"At the same time, you can't really afford to draft and develop guys when you have so much money tied up at the big league level. If you take the long term approach, you will waste Miggy's prime waiting for them to develop.  You would need ready now prospects. Even then, it will be a bumpy road."
baseball,3e2qxk,RollingRock60,2,Tue Jul 21 17:45:40 2015 UTC,"I would also throw McCann in this list.  He is cheap, young, and having one hell of a year right now.  I think he is our future catcher.  Everyone else....Deuces."
baseball,3e2qxk,thedeejus,5,Tue Jul 21 17:32:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't hesitate to trade any of those guys either.  Miggy is Miggy, but it isn't like he's a Tiger lifer, and he's going to be VERY overpaid in a few years, for several years.  If it's time to go into rebuilding mode and someone is willing to take on that contract, you do it.  JD is also probably a good trade candidate - he's a late bloomer who might be a flash in the pan or might be the real deal, but either way his trade value is maximal right now.  Iglesias is probably young enough to just hang on to, but again, I'd listen to offers on him."
baseball,3e2qxk,skinnyguy34879,15,Tue Jul 21 15:34:00 2015 UTC,Ok the Tigers are not in full blown fire sale mode lol.. They can easily compete next year with a couple FA additions.
baseball,3e2qxk,wjg10,14,Tue Jul 21 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly, these guys talking about getting rid of Miggy and the young team controlled guys like Iglesias, JD Martinez, and McCann are nuts.  Those guys, along with VMart, Miggy, Kinsler, Gose, and Castellanos if he puts it together is a very solid core of position players ready to compete for the next 3+ years.  Dombrowski needs to retool the rotation and figure out the bullpen, but this will be a reload for '16, not a true re-build."
baseball,3e2qxk,skinnyguy34879,7,Tue Jul 21 16:49:38 2015 UTC,"Tigers could easily take the roster they have now, wait for Miggy to come back, and they might make the wild card. But their rotation is not going to win them everything unless Sanchez and someone else.. Verlander (??) turn it on. Probably better to sell Cespedes and Price and if they really want them then re-sign in off season."
baseball,3e2qxk,wjg10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:53 2015 UTC,"Yep. I think signing Price is not realistic, but they certainly could go right back after Cespedes this winter after flipping him for whatever they can.    Yeah, the starting pitching is the reason why they're in sell mode even though they're .500, hitting the ball everywhere, and still waiting for Miggy to come back. Price is great, Sanchez has been up and down all year, Verlander just can't get consistent, and Greene and Simon have hit a wall and get shelled every night.  That's not looking to change and there's no real help in Toledo as their best guy down there is hurt for the year.  If there was any faith in the rotation I think Dombrowksi would work to add one arm and hope one of the struggling guys gets it together.    What's interesting is there's some other free agents to be that might be moved or at least packaged. Rajaii Davis is a good platoon player. He is a great bench bat that hits LHP well, can play all over the OF, and is a great base stealer.  Soria is an established very good bullpen arm.  Avila is a bonafied MLB C who could fill a hole if a team was desperate there due to injury or something.    If DD is going to waive the white flag, they might as well go all out and trade every soon to be free agent they can, sit Miggy for the remainder, and let the Mudhens play at Comerica for 2 months."
baseball,3e2qxk,skinnyguy34879,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:56 2015 UTC,"Ya Rajaii is a FA and like 35 anyways, probably wouldn't get anything much for him though. Avila probably doesn't have much value other than a back-up catcher, possibly platoon with how he hits. No real reason to keep either if they are going into sell mode though."
baseball,3e2qxk,thrownoutta,6,Tue Jul 21 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"For sure. It would sting considerably to watch Miggy in another uniform, but it's a business. I think JD is the real deal. I know he's struggled throughout his career, but the dude works his ass off to play at his current clip. Iglesias will stay, if the baseball gods are merciful."
baseball,3e2qxk,jtheil,5,Tue Jul 21 15:36:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything but Miggy, he's so much more than a player on the team. Even when he's old, he'll be extremely important. I'm sure he has a few more years of solid production, but even whens he's older, we're talking about a hall of famer on our team that brings in fans and keeps people watching the team. Even if we start losing, there are those fans who only tune in to continue and watch history be made as Cabrera plays in the twilight, making the team money indirectly."
baseball,3e2qxk,WAAAAAAAAAALT,4,Tue Jul 21 16:13:38 2015 UTC,I don't know how Miggy being in another uniform is even a topic of conversation; both Dombrowski has said he wants Miggy to retire a Tiger and Miggy has said he wants to retire a Tiger. Miggy is staying regardless of what happens over the years. Nobody in the entire Tigers organization is going to pass on retaining and retiring the greatest hitter to play the game this era.
baseball,3e2qxk,GoSomaliPirates,3,Tue Jul 21 16:16:21 2015 UTC,Albert Pujols is the greatest hitter of this era.

baseball,3e2qxk,KaufKaufKauf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:21 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think if you find a taker for Miggy with no or minimal money needed to be eaten, then you have to take it. Miggy is going to make 28m-30m the next 8 years (!!!) that will be an absolute killer to the Tigers once he's old and declining. Could he be good throughout? Sure, but damn, if he isn't the Tigers are destroyed. To be honest I think Miggy's trade value with no money being eaten by the Tigers is very close to zero. Nobody wants that contract and that risk. He's the best hitter right now, but damn, once he declines that's a contract you can't have weighing you down."

But miggy has said he wants to retire a tiger and he has a NTC, so we'll see if he'd event accept a trade"
baseball,3e2qxk,GraemeTaylor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:30 2015 UTC,"He's the best hitter right now, but will be for a good part of those 8 years. Look at Pujols now at 35 - still leading the majors in homers.  Cabrera will be worth keeping.  Also, if it's close to zero, does that mean that in a trade of Cabrera for Brett Lawrie, the team sending Lawrie won by a mile?"

baseball,3e2qxk,mycousinvinny,2,Tue Jul 21 14:43:18 2015 UTC,"I actually don't think the gap is closing too quickly. Dombrowski knows what he is doing. Although.. Signing JV to the money he got was ridiculous imo. Easy to say now that he isn't producing but I said that when they signed him to it, despite all he has done for the tigers.. He wasn't worth that much.   If the tigers can trade away Price, Cespedes, and maybe Vmart (just because he is old) for some young arms and a solid OF prospect or two.. I think they can be right back in it next year. I don't see Vmart being moved though.. Especially cause his trade value is low right now due to injury and his new contract.   That being said.. Without a true ace signing in the offseason.. Tigers won't be in much of a race next year.   Plus I think Ausmus is a pretty low tier manager."
baseball,3e2qxk,jz68,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"Remember when the ""window was closing"" after the 2009 season with that crazy game 163. The core from 2006 was on the way out through free agency (Polanco) or age/health (Guillen, Magglio). The farm system didn't look so great at the time, but Dombrowski made some bold moves in the offseason which set up the 4-5 year period of success we've had since. He traded some of the assets other teams coveted (Granderson, Edwin Jackson) and received major league ready, young talent (Austin Jackson, Scherzer) in return. Fans were pissed that Granderson was traded, but obviously it worked out well for the Tigers. I think Dave's track record (second Fister trade aside) should indicate that he'll be able to make the right moves to improve the Tigers outlook in 2016 and in coming years."

baseball,3e2qxk,wjg10,3,Tue Jul 21 15:21:17 2015 UTC,"We already stole Travis off them, maybe we could steal Price?"
baseball,3e2qxk,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,7,Tue Jul 21 16:16:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that yet. Gose has played well for us being league average at the plate and elite in Comerica's huge outfield.  Travis has hit well in what, 50ish games?  The only way that's considered a steal is if Gose can't play at all for us because Travis was completely blocked in our org."
baseball,3e2qxk,mycousinvinny,3,Tue Jul 21 16:53:12 2015 UTC,"We already know what Gose is, a platoon bat (career 31 wRC+ vs LHP) who can't hit for power (career .102 ISO), doesn't walk a lot (career 7% BB%) and strikes out a shit ton (career 27% K%). He's an acceptable bench piece but on no team should he be the primary starter."
baseball,3e2qxk,Cock-PushUps,4,Tue Jul 21 17:14:44 2015 UTC,"He is better than just a bench piece. He is a platoon guy, but he is on the side of the platoon that is going to get the majority of the at-bats. Pairing him with a guy like Rajai Davis who hits lefties well makes for a solid center field position. In their cases, whoever doesn't start can be a valuable weapon as a pinch hitter or runner off the bench.   By not forcing him into situations he's likely to fail (against good left-handed pitching) his numbers are improving. He still strikes out too much (around 27% again this year) and needs to draw more walks, but for a guy who is primarily providing value with his speed and on defense in center at the large Comerica Park, he could be a valuable contributor on a contender for years to come. I've been extremely impressed with his defense. We've had some pretty good guys out in center recently, Austin Jackson, a young Curtis Granderson, but Gose tops them both in my opinion."

Then when you start winning games you make more money to pay the team better. This isn't just for the current Royals team.

It's better that they simply lose these guys in the offseason than getting prospects back who can help them in the future. The Tigers farm system is in shambles and their payroll is bloated for years to come. The last thing we want is for them to trade rental players for quality prospects.
baseball,3e2qxk,fantasyfest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:23 2015 UTC,Hard pass. Tigers farm is terrible and should remain terrible.
baseball,3e2qxk,confused-koala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:47 2015 UTC,"Price and Cespedes are at the end of their contracts. They are unlikely to resign with the Tigers since 30 teams will go after them. If the Tigers do well in the next week or 2, they will be kept to make the playoffs. If the team does badly, they will likely be offered. I doubt they will be traded real soon.  Price and Cespedes can get some decent players from a contender.  Who would not want price?"

Judging by this article Tim will likely have to get hip replacement down the road or he'll end up in a wheel chair / really debilitated . It is not curable and will just get worse. That's me speculating but Osteo of the hip is the second most common type of arthritis there is, so I would bet on it!"

They are quite amazing really.  How long have you been on those new hips and how soon do you anticipate getting another down the line when that one wears out?

baseball,3e3gzt,Penderdragon,8,Tue Jul 21 18:50:35 2015 UTC,"Looking at the numbers, it seems that bad luck is his main problem.  His K rate, BB rate, FIP, and xFIP are almost identical to last year.  His HR/FB is up, BABIP is way up, and LOB% is way down.  He doesn't need to go to AAA, he just needs to keep pitching."
baseball,3e3gzt,NLRD,6,Tue Jul 21 18:05:19 2015 UTC,His hard hit rate is up 8% from last year while his soft hit rate is down 10%. He's definitely still had some bad luck but the hard hit rating probably has a little to due with him underperforming his FIP.
baseball,3e3gzt,sjm1541,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:06 2015 UTC,"Yesterday's game was very weird.  He completely shut down hitters at one point, but then gives up 5 straight hits the next.

His ERA was 13.5 for the game, but if you use fangraph's cFIP constant his FIP for the night was 0.308.  I don't necessarily think AAA would be bad for him - especially since our rotation is playing musical chairs right now - but he didn't pitch nearly as bad as the runs made it look last night."

baseball,3e3gzt,materhern,5,Tue Jul 21 18:34:07 2015 UTC,His addition to the bullpen seems like an experiment for a bullpen that is doing pretty well on it's own. What's to add by doing that?   He's 24. He should go down to AAA and work on some stuff. That's exactly what the tribe did last year with Salazar.

baseball,3e3gzt,IIHURRlCANEII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:13 2015 UTC,"His attitude hasn't been the problem.

He's the biggest prospect bust not just because he had a bad career, but because he was a catastrophe of a human being.

That's all it's been for 15 years, so it's fair to think that's all it will ever be.

Looking back, he didn't deserve the first pick of the first round, but I don't think that puts him into flop territory. He's been pretty consistent, hitting .283/.316/.421 overall in his career, and even though he's had a few average years recently, he's still a guy you'd lead off your batting order with."
baseball,3e2yye,novafire08,11,Tue Jul 21 17:53:02 2015 UTC,Why would you bat a guy leadoff with a .316 obp?
baseball,3e2yye,STNbrossy,4,Tue Jul 21 18:07:41 2015 UTC,"That's overall in his career. Last year his OBP was .337 and this year it's .289. For comparison, Dozier has been hitting leadoff for us for most of this year and his OBP is .331. Delmon hasn't been consistent, but there are plenty of clubs where he would be considered for batting leadoff during his good years."
baseball,3e2yye,novafire08,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:37 2015 UTC,"Usually he hovers around .305 with some outliers in each direction, I just think there are better options on most teams just saying."
baseball,3e2yye,STNbrossy,3,Tue Jul 21 18:18:21 2015 UTC,"True, but I don't think that makes him a flop though. To me, a flop is someone like Rick Ankiel, who was such a bad pitcher he had to go back to the minors and change positions."

baseball,3e2yye,scottyway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:57:02 2015 UTC,I'd say even worse than Snider and Romero was Deck McGuire at 11th overall. Snider and Romero at least have a few years of service time at the MLB level. At least we got Sanchez and Syndergaard out of that draft.

Fulmer will probably do the same, taking Shark's spot in the rotation.  Don Cooper seems to be the only one who can work magic and help a young pitcher.

Unfortunately, he would never have a season where he had as high a batting average, OBP, or slugging % as he did for the half season he played as a rookie.  He was so damn talented, but the guy just never adopted anything that resembles plate discipline.  As a disclaimer, I would like to say that I'm a huge fan of Francoeur, and love that he is still playing.  And technically he is not a flop because he has played 11 seasons in the majors.

Drafted ninth overall at the age of 17 by the Royals, Hurdle posted an OPS of .847 at A ball in 1976, then went straight to AAA, where he had an OPS of .978 in 1977, hitting 16 home runs. He got a cup of coffee in the majors that season, then was promoted full-time to the club in 1978, but he never lived up to the hype.  His best season was in 1980, when he hit .294/.349/.458 in 130 games with 10 HR and 60 RBI, but then he bounced around before retiring in 1987 at the age of 29 after playing 515 games in the majors."

baseball,3e2yye,ProfessorEpic,-7,Tue Jul 21 17:30:56 2015 UTC,Bossman Junior Upton edit: I no longer think he's a complete bust but he isn't a success either
baseball,3e2yye,agrueeatedu,24,Tue Jul 21 15:49:37 2015 UTC,"B.J. Upton was actually pretty damned good for a while. While he's absolutely horrible now, I definitely wouldn't consider him a bust."
baseball,3e2yye,ProfessorEpic,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:55:47 2015 UTC,His 2007 and 2008 years were definitely good and he flashed a bit of power in a few seasons hitting 20+ homers but for a #2 pick I would consider him a bust if he hadn't been taken first round or as early as he was I probably wouldn't. Delmon Young was taken 1st but even though he rarely plays a full season and is pretty bad defensively he is a consistent hitter and is suited towards a DH slot. BJ can't hit and his fielding seems pretty average. If he could still hit .240 with solid defense he'd still be valuable to some teams.
baseball,3e2yye,lankyskanky,9,Tue Jul 21 16:07:18 2015 UTC,You are way off if you think Delmon has had a better career than Melvin.   Delmon has negative career WAR.
baseball,3e2yye,ProfessorEpic,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:20:46 2015 UTC,I never said he had a good career but his negative WAR is caused by defense which is why I mentioned that he is suited to a DH role because he's probably average to slightly above average offensively and he's insanely clutch
baseball,3e2yye,lankyskanky,8,Tue Jul 21 16:33:51 2015 UTC,Delmon has a career 98 OPS+   That's bad
baseball,3e2yye,ProfessorEpic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:38 2015 UTC,Melvin has a 97. That's also bad and Delmon hasn't started the majority of a season since 2012 and BJ has started for every year except for 2006 and 2015
baseball,3e2yye,ThePaddingtonBear,5,Tue Jul 21 16:53:49 2015 UTC,Melvin has a 97. That's also bad   It's not bad. It's about average. That's fine when you're providing good value on defense and on the basepaths. It's not fine when you're a butcher in the corner OF or a DH like Delmon.
baseball,3e2yye,lankyskanky,3,Tue Jul 21 17:11:37 2015 UTC,But you were trying to imply that his defense is what was holding him back. A 98 OPS+ when you are a terrible defender with no speed makes you a terrible player. That's why he has negative WAR 9 years into his career.
baseball,3e2yye,gibsonlespaul,4,Tue Jul 21 17:49:35 2015 UTC,"You do realize many first rounders, even high first rounders, don't even sniff the major leagues.  The fact that BJ has had a solid career up to this point does not make him a bust."
baseball,3e2yye,ProfessorEpic,0,Tue Jul 21 16:59:52 2015 UTC,"Absolutely I understand that it's extremely hard to get into the mlb as a prospect but when you compare him to players of the same draft that also make it to the mlb and are still active it's not even close about how he wasn't a #2 first rounder based on his career. He was in the same draft as Votto, Greinke,Prince,Hamels,Francoeur,Span and Swisher. Francoeur had a similar career of 2-3 good seasons, several average seasons and a good amount of bad ones and I don't consider him a success. I don't think Melvin is a complete bust since he still has some utility as a 4th outfielder but with his contract and offensive capabilities I would rather find another player for cheaper and that could probably hit the ball better."

baseball,3e2yye,Tuggernuts23,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:57 2015 UTC,"A bust is not meeting expectations to an extreme degree.  If people expect a 20th round draft pick to play for 10 seasons and hit 100 home runs, with a .280 average over a career, and he plays for 10 seasons, hits .276 and 95 career home runs, you wouldn't call him a bust.  If he never made the majors, he'd be a bust.  If he plays 3 seasons and hits .240 with 5 home runs, he might be a bust.  It is certainly true that everyone has their own threshold of ""bust"", but if you truly believe that Strasburg is a bust, you are certainly on the extreme side of the bell-curve."
baseball,3e2yye,nufandan,5,Tue Jul 21 18:31:16 2015 UTC,"no way, he might not be the very best pitcher in the league like some thought he might be, but he also had to have TJ surgery so quick into his career and been a very solid, above average pitcher since. He has a career FIP of 2.90 and has already produced 16.3 WAR. You can't really say a prospect is a flop if he ends up being worth so much more than his contract, which was the biggest contract ever given to a draft pick when he signed."

baseball,3e2s4x,Charmanderp7,27,Tue Jul 21 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"Wasn't at the deadline, but recently the Greinke trade really ended up hurting the Crew in the long run. If he would have been 1.3 ERA Greinke then yes, trade away all the studs for him. But the Brewers compete for a NL title that year most likely with or without Greinke.   We lost a lot of our farm system in that trade. Alcides Escobar, Lorenzo Cain and Jake Ordorizzi (plus we had to throw in the great Yuniesky Betancourt).  We ended up getting back Segura for Greinke but that is hardly a good consolation prize."
baseball,3e2s4x,ivandragostwin,18,Tue Jul 21 15:35:45 2015 UTC,Wow. Imagine your outfield if you could slot Gomez in left and Cain in center. I think this is why you shouldn't pay for rentals.
baseball,3e2s4x,ClaytonBigsB,21,Tue Jul 21 15:42:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair to our GM (I still think Melvin sucks but that's a different convo), Greinke wasn't really a rental. He had 2 years of his contract left and he said he wanted to stay in a small market. So the Crew were optimistic, as long as we won we could resign him.   Of course, the winning only lasted for a year due to losing Prince and Braun being a dipshit. So when the deadline came he was the main trade piece we had to salvage our farm system."
baseball,3e2s4x,ivandragostwin,3,Tue Jul 21 15:56:23 2015 UTC,"Ok, I was under the impression that he was for a year."
baseball,3e2s4x,ClaytonBigsB,11,Tue Jul 21 16:02:52 2015 UTC,"This has probably been brought up before, but I don't regret the trade because 1)They needed a frontline starter to make a run for what would be Fielder's last season. 2) I don't think they would be much closer to a contender with Cain, Escobar, and Ordorizzi this year. It's hard to tell with what ifs. That was their best season of my lifetime. I think its risky to start second guessing it in the vacuum of hindsight."
baseball,3e2s4x,crewblue,6,Tue Jul 21 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"This is true, and if David Freese doesn't have the greatest 20 games of his lifetime that postseason, and we catch a few breaks and win the world series? I would never be bringing this up, so it is a bit unfair.   I just wonder if we have Ordorizzi, if we ever trade Gallardo, and in that case we may have been able to compete..but then we probably don't call up Jungmann..Im going to stop before I go to far down the rabbit hole."
baseball,3e2s4x,ivandragostwin,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:29 2015 UTC,The reason the Brewers weren't in the World Series that year was because of Freese but most importantly the Cardinals bullpen. The bullpen pitched more innings than the starters did. That is insane. I also attribute the failures of the last three years to the poor drafting since the departure of Jack Zduriencik. I can't pin it for sure but the vast majority of quality major leaguers for the Brewers over the last 15 years were drafted during his tenure. He's been gone for 7 years and it shows.
baseball,3e2s4x,crewblue,9,Tue Jul 21 16:58:10 2015 UTC,Yeah two of our best players came over in that trade. Cain is our MVP and Escobar is having a career year.
baseball,3e2s4x,IIHURRlCANEII,6,Tue Jul 21 15:58:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's actually really cool to see how great of a player Cain has become in KC.   He was so raw with the Crew, but god damn was he a talented athlete, always fun to see a player live up to the potential even if it makes me play the ""what if"" game every now and then."
baseball,3e2s4x,ivandragostwin,9,Tue Jul 21 16:16:58 2015 UTC,"You got Carlos Gomez who went the other way. People were saying he was raw and undisciplined, but he rewarded the Brewers' faith in him."
baseball,3e2s4x,PoorUnderdogYankees,2,Tue Jul 21 16:25:48 2015 UTC,"He still is raw and undisciplined tho, he's just getting results now."
baseball,3e2s4x,agrueeatedu,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:11 2015 UTC,"Im not sure if he is still raw, he has some great baseball skills now. He is undisciplined, which makes him frustrating, but also really fucking fun to watch.  Im going to be pissed when we trade him. It is the smart thing to do, probably smart to try and do it this year and get a bigger return honestly.  But to me he is one of the most exciting players in baseball, I will definitely miss him when he is gone."
baseball,3e2s4x,ivandragostwin,4,Tue Jul 21 18:29:45 2015 UTC,"I thought we were going to regret that Greinke trade in the long run, but after that good first half, Segura has been forgettable"
baseball,3e2s4x,SouthernDerpfornia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:09 2015 UTC,Not as forgettable as Greinke's half season with the Angels though.
baseball,3e2s4x,brewcrew2_2,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:29 2015 UTC,"Outside of his 1st half in 2013, Segura has been worth 0.1 fWAR"
baseball,3e2s4x,SouthernDerpfornia,2,Tue Jul 21 18:17:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think he will ever be the star that some people thought during that first half. I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt though over this past year since he has been through a pretty horrific tragedy in losing his son. It would be tough for even the bet to bounce back from that immediately.   I think he has the talent to be at the level of Escobar, a decent hitter, and great defensively/on the base paths. Hopefully he can get there"
baseball,3e2s4x,ivandragostwin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:27 2015 UTC,Greinke's fWAR after 2012 for the Angels is 0.0 so we're still winning the trade.

baseball,3e2s4x,Penderdragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:06 2015 UTC,"Escobar figuring out how to hit is what makes the deal look worse for the Brewers, but for a team that at best has a small window to compete they had to make the deal."

baseball,3e2s4x,YourCummyBear,8,Tue Jul 21 15:30:26 2015 UTC,The Astros shelled out Freddy Garcia and Carlos Guillen for two months of Randy Johnson. It's hard to argue it's lopsided for a team that had never won a pennant before and Johnson was Cy Young caliber that year.
baseball,3e2s4x,crewblue,3,Tue Jul 21 16:29:08 2015 UTC,"Ben Zobrist + Mitch Talbot (who ended up a scrub) for 68 games of .250/.341/.478 and no postseason from Aubrey Huff in 2006.  Oswalt was also pretty bad. Sent him to Philly for JA Happ, Anthony Gose (flipped immediately for Brett Wallace, who was a scrub and DFA'd), and Jonathan Villar (who is a scrub and will eventually be DFA'd). A few years later we flipped Happ to the Jays with some prospects I haven't heard from since. The return was abysmal, including Francisco Cordero (posted a 19.80 ERA and was DFA'd that same season), Ben Francisco (traded a few weeks later to Tampa Bay for non-prospect Theron Geith, who pitched 1/3 of an inning in AA for us last year. Can't find any stats since), Asher Wojcihrealkluehski (started the season in the rotation, banished to Fresno after posting a 7.something ERA in 4 games. Currently rocking a 4.89 in 77 AAA innings), David Rollins (minor league pitcher, actually posted a half decent 3.81 ERA 3.24 FIP in AA last season. Rule V'd by the Mariners, slapped with an 80 game suspension for the juice, rocking a 12.4 ERA in 4 innings in the Mariners MLB bullpen), Joe Musgrove (got off to a slow start but has recently emerged as a legitimate fringe prospect, throwing 77 innings of 2.8 ERA ball in short-season last year, and following up with a sub-3.0 ERA performance across combined 77 innings of low-A, high-A, and AA ball this year in his age-22 season), Carlos Perez (mediocre MiLB catcher later traded with Tropeano for Hank Conger). We also sent Brandon Lyons and David Carpenter with Happ, neither are on an MLB roster currently though Carpenter was traded for John Farrell, so that's kind of interesting.  On the other side of the ledger we have Pence for Singleton, Santana, Zeid (scrub we DFA'd, currently rolling a 4.63 ERA in AAA for the Tigers) and Jared Cosart. Cosart was flipped last season for Marisnick, former first round draft pick and current AAA 3B Colin Moran, and a low-A lotto ticket pitcher. Cosart is hanging out in AAA with a cool 6.06 ERA right now."

baseball,3e1a8z,scottfarrar,29,Tue Jul 21 16:56:33 2015 UTC,It was nice of the Angels to let the us know that we are going to be sellers at the trade deadline.  Too bad we don't have much to sell.
baseball,3e1a8z,NUKEFreeman,6,Tue Jul 21 06:02:39 2015 UTC,One Mookie please.  In all honesty the Red Sox have a lot of good pieces. They'll be back to being contenders very shortly IMO
baseball,3e1a8z,Packattack622,8,Tue Jul 21 06:07:42 2015 UTC,"They have great pieces for the future, and I'm excited for it.  But with Buchholz hurt, the only pieces the Red Sox have to move right now are Holt, Uehara and Tazawa, and I don't want to deal Tazawa if Koji is dealt, because I want him to be the next closer.  It's a dumpster fire season with crap pieces to sell.  It can only go up, I guess!"
baseball,3e1a8z,NUKEFreeman,11,Tue Jul 21 06:12:32 2015 UTC,It could be worse. We could be the Phillies.

baseball,3e1a8z,energize-,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:35 2015 UTC,They have a decent farm system thankfully. I've been following Matt Barnes really closely and still have faith he'll turn out great. You guys also have enough appeal and money to sign anyone so I wouldn't worry.
baseball,3e1a8z,Packattack622,2,Tue Jul 21 06:22:49 2015 UTC,I'm not too worry.  The future looks bright.  The present just sucks.
baseball,3e1a8z,NUKEFreeman,6,Tue Jul 21 06:24:31 2015 UTC,If only I had your optimism. This sounds like Mets fans circa 2009.
baseball,3e1a8z,B0pp0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:19:56 2015 UTC,"I'd say that their farm is better than decent, though they have to give their young players time instead of expecting them to immediately produce."
baseball,3e1a8z,munromae,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:05 2015 UTC,"Depends.  If they can stop refusing to pay for top line starters (which they are.  The ""under 30"" thing takes them out of the running for basically any available ace) and learn that you need power in the bullpen, not a bunch of guys sitting at 89-93 then yes.  Otherwise they will stay right where they are."
baseball,3e1a8z,Beelzebot44,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:09 2015 UTC,"The only person we might sell is Buchholz, not many guys have trade value"
baseball,3e1a8z,dukeslver,3,Tue Jul 21 15:02:52 2015 UTC,"Holt, Uehara and Tazawa definitely do.  Some teams could be interested in Victorino as a bench player, but he wouldn't bring much back in a return."
baseball,3e1a8z,NUKEFreeman,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:10 2015 UTC,Koji is the only one among those the Sox should even think about trading. Taz and \o/ have too much value to the team in coming years unless someone offers a significant overpay.
baseball,3e1a8z,metatron207,2,Tue Jul 21 15:47:32 2015 UTC,I'd trade Holt in a heart beat.  He is a 27 year old utility player.  His value will never be higher.
baseball,3e1a8z,NUKEFreeman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:23 2015 UTC,"He's a valuable player, and an All-Star, so maybe another team gives up something worthwhile. But I wouldn't trade him just to be sellers. I'm very comfortable with the overall makeup of this team, minus a couple of pitchers, and what I'd really like more than anything is for the Sox to not make a single move at the deadline unless someone comes knocking at their door willing to give up pieces of serious value for Koji, TFH, Napoli, Masterson, or maybe Holt or Taz. Yes, the last two probably won't have their hypothetical value rise much beyond what it is now, but unless that materializes in players that will help the Sox in the next two years or so, I'd hang on to them."
baseball,3e1a8z,metatron207,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:31 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree, but I'm trading Holt in ten days because there will be a decent return for him.  He's falling back to Earth quickly (just like he did in the second half last season) and his value will only drop.  I like him, he's a decent player that can play seven positions, but he is not a part of this core moving forward.  Holt, Uehara and Tazawa certainly have value on the market.  If someone is willing to give up ANYTHING for Napoli, Victorino, or Masterson, you take it and run.  All three have expiring contracts and will not be brought back next season.  They have no use on a last place team.  Get what you can for those three, if you can get anything at all."
baseball,3e1a8z,NUKEFreeman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure we really disagree, and if we do it's a minor disagreement about what Holt would bring back. You're spot-on that if anyone offers anything for Nap/Masterson/Victorino you take it, even if it requires paying most or all of their contract. I think you move Koji, and I expect that he'll bring a decent return despite his age, since he's still a solid late-innings reliever. I'm not sure how much team control Taz has left, and that's the complicating factor for me; if he only has another year after this year, it would be prudent to see what other teams will offer. That said, you don't really want to get rid of your two best late-inning pitchers with the rest of the bullpen looking so sparse.  As for \o/, what kind of return do you think the Sox would get? I would expect a mid-level prospect or an average to slightly above-average bullpen piece. I think his versatility is valuable enough that neither of those would be a no-brainer for the Sox, and I don't think they would get much more than that."
baseball,3e1a8z,metatron207,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:20 2015 UTC,"I think Holt can definitely get you a good prospect.  He is under team control until 2020 and is certain a great utility guy.  He just gets exposed when he plays every day, which is why I want to trade him now.  I'm certainly not going to dump him or trade him to trade, but I definitely think he can bring a good return back.  If he can't get a good enough return, I am fine with keeping him as a super utility guy, but I'm trading him if you can get a good return for him.  As for Tazawa, he is under team control for next season, and will become a free agent after 2016.  I want to keep him.  I want him to be the closer if/when the Red Sox trade Uehara.  I'll definitely consider trading Tazawa, especially if we can get a return like we did for Andrew Miller.  We should definitely trade Uehara because of his age and the fact we aren't competing the rest of the season (and he might show his age next season) but I want to keep Tazawa.  He certainly does have trade value, though."
baseball,3e1a8z,NUKEFreeman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:55 2015 UTC,"I think we're on the same page about what the Sox should do, and the Miller trade is a good example of what Ben's capable of in the trade market."
baseball,3e1a8z,metatron207,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"those guys don't have as much trade value as you think, they'd get bad returns."
baseball,3e1a8z,dukeslver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:21 2015 UTC,"Two proven, late inning bullpen guys that are under team control for 2016 and a super utility player that is under control until 2020.  They have good value.  They aren't going to get a return like Cueto, Price, or Hamels would get, but they can get a good return for those pieces."
baseball,3e1a8z,NUKEFreeman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:50 2015 UTC,not a good enough return to justify trading guys that could help us in 2-3 years (Holt & Tazawa). I'd rather have them instead of the shitty prospects they'd get in return.
baseball,3e1a8z,dukeslver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:12 2015 UTC,"Holt is a good bench player, but how much is he going to help in 2-3 years?  If he's starting for us in a few years, it is because this team hasn't improved and we are stuck in last place again. He's a good player, but I think even a decent prospect has a bigger impact on the 2018 Red Sox than Brock Holt would.  I don't want to trade Tazawa, but he certainly can get you a good return.  He has a year and a half of team control, which only increases his value.  Three months of Andrew Miller was able to land the Red Sox Eduardo Rodriguez.  A year and a half of Tazawa will get the Red Sox a great return."
baseball,3e1a8z,NUKEFreeman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:26 2015 UTC,"Tazawa is nowhere near Andrew Miller... and Miller is a lefty which increases his value by quite a bit. And that trade was a bit of a freak thing, no other team would give up a prospect like Rodriguez for Miller or Tazawa."

baseball,3e37n2,Krunklock,2,Tue Jul 21 18:05:16 2015 UTC,"Less than.  Evidence: we are underperforming our BaseRuns (and less-importantly, our Pythag) by many games.  Possible reasons:    An embarrassment of bench riches - we have 4 pretty good 1B/DH types and no place to put them (5 when Bautista's shoulder acts-up or when Gibbons decides that we should DH Navarro when we clearly have 3-4 better options available). Meanwhile, we have ~0 good left fielders (and when Bautista's shoulder acts up, we have 0 right fielders either). A misuse of resources: our starters aren't very good and they're left in too long. We have one of the best defensive SS in the game on the bench, but he won't be brought in as a late-game defensive replacement, even though our primary SS is notoriously weak with the glove and has committed game-losing errors. Both of these mismanagements were on display during the Sale-Buerhle start a few weeks ago. Also, our leadoff hitter is currently the team's 9th most-productive hitter. An historically unclutch bullpen. Per Fangraphs, going back to the franchise's founding in 1977, the Blue Jays have the least-clutch bullpen in the Majors. This trend is not abating this year. It is probably not helped by the somewhat arbitrary nature in which bullpen assignments are handed-out. Our best relievers are burned in mop-ups and our ""depth"" relievers are thrown into critical situations."

baseball,3e37n2,NC206,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"we're saying felix is having a down year because he has had two very bad starts.   if you drop those starts against the yankees and the astros where he got shelled, his ERA drops from 2.77 (38 ER over 123.1 IP) to 1.75 (23 ER over 118.1 IP). that's no grienke ERA but it's still fucking incredible."
baseball,3e37n2,slambient,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:10 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately consistency is a huge factor in pitching. Felix had one bad start last year that lost him the CY.

I think he'll definitely beat Ruth's record if he can stay even moderately healthy for the rest of his contract. But hey, maybe if he plays until his age 43 season he could do it. If I had the potential to break the all time HR record I would do it, but Pujols is very humble and I think he'd likely retire after his contract with the Angels is up"
baseball,3e0wb7,pezzshnitsol,20,Tue Jul 21 02:53:27 2015 UTC,"Gotta keep in mind the magic of the DH.   Assuming he reaches 40 HR this year, if he averages 27 HR a year of the next 6 years it puts him at 722.   If he can hang around for a couple seasons as a RH power bat off the bench with the ability to play first, who knows?"
baseball,3e0wb7,KwanzaaSanta,11,Tue Jul 21 02:59:15 2015 UTC,"I did consider that. I don't think he can beat it within the life of his contract is all I'm saying. He could theoretically keep playing until his hips and knees explode and he would for sure beat the record.   But given 7 or more likely 8 years he would beat it. It's all a matter of if that's what he wants to do. Its hard to imagine such a talented player getting so close to the record and then deciding to stop playing. But I think Pujols could be that type of person, not to chase the records but to just play his heart out for as long as he thinks he's contributing."
baseball,3e0wb7,pezzshnitsol,7,Tue Jul 21 03:04:27 2015 UTC,"Agh sorry missed that last sentence your first point.   Good point though, he does seem like that kinda guy.   For our own selfish reasons, let's hope he's selfish enough lol"
baseball,3e0wb7,KwanzaaSanta,8,Tue Jul 21 03:06:33 2015 UTC,"Haha seriously. All I want is for him to break the HR record while the Angels and Cardinals hold hands and sing kumbaya, witnessing in awe the greatest batter in the history of the game"
baseball,3e0wb7,pezzshnitsol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:09:52 2015 UTC,breaking it in a series against the cards would be divine.

baseball,3e0wb7,PipBorick,9,Tue Jul 21 17:51:43 2015 UTC,"No way. He's already shown signs of breaking down even though he's looked relatively healthy this. Granted the DH would help but you're talking an average of 35-40 HRs a season. Even for a guy who stays healthy, with power, anyone in their mid to late 30s would have a hard time reaching that."

baseball,3dzn01,BJ2K,28,Mon Jul 20 20:43:18 2015 UTC,Those of us who've watched him all this time see him making these plays quite often.  So it really kind of proves the whole thing about getting noticed before you get noticed.  Esky has been making those plays since he's been here and I've never seen him make the top play yet here he makes it 3 times from one game.
baseball,3dzn01,Chelsor,4,Mon Jul 20 22:58:18 2015 UTC,"Making up for lost time. Esky is a fans SS. You don't have to be a Royal homer to recognize his skill. But the casual baseball fan has no idea who he is. I feel like the same thing with Cain. Easily one of the best outfeilders and is giving chase to Trout for MVP. Cain should have been the all-star MVP. Trout deserves every bit of recognition he gets, and if he stays healthy and continues on his trend, he will probably be the greatest to ever play. But still nobody outside of baseball fans know who Cain is. Baseball needs to market it's players better."
baseball,3dzn01,Bogey_Redbud,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:09 2015 UTC,"I have been thinking about that for a while. MLB is awful at marketing its players. The NBA and NFL run laps around the marketing side of things. Even though I think MLB is a lot more fan friendly than those other sports. I appreciate that they post replays quickly for anyone to see for free in high quality. And they don't filter out those replays just for PR purposes. They include things like fights, fans doing weird things, etc."

Bryce's walk rate is approaching 20% once again, and it's causing him to strike out looking more, because he's expecting to get pitched around.

baseball,3dzfli,Zackadeez,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"Perhaps ""pitched backwards"" is the better term.  He's getting pitches outside of the zone early in the count and inside the zone late, so he's striking out looking a ton because he's not expecting balls in the zone.

If you take a look at Halladay and Lee in 2011, I think you'd see that Kershaw and Greinke are set to exceed their numbers (although I understand we're only a little over than halfway through the season), and no one has put forward a better duo."
baseball,3dzfli,spiffmana,5,Mon Jul 20 22:34:14 2015 UTC,"Kershaw is just past a third of the way to the WAR that Halladay had that season. Greinke may surpass Lee's WAR for 2011, but Kershaw is going to finish below 8.7 this year."

baseball,3dzfli,Dacryphile,6,Mon Jul 20 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"If we are talking about just Duos, then the only one that could really compete with them over the last decade or so would be the Halladay/Lee duo in 2011.    Kershaw is hands down better than Wainwright and Greinke is better than Carpenter.  Kershaw and Greinke are better than Oswalt and you can't really count Roger Clemens seasons once he hit his 40s because he was on steroids at that point in his career."
baseball,3dzfli,Dacryphile,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:00 2015 UTC,"you can't really count Roger Clemens seasons once he hit his 40s because he was on steroids at that point in his career.   Disagree. Dislike it all you want, he was allowed to play. He played, his stats are in the books, and if they didn't want it to count they would've done something about it.  I still think Kershaw and Greinke are better, but to just say Clemens doesn't count is to pretend he wasn't playing. He definitely was."
baseball,3dzfli,paulx441,2,Mon Jul 20 21:04:49 2015 UTC,I meant I'm just saying you can't really count him as a better pitcher than Kershaw or Greinkie during those seasons because his performance was artificially enhanced. Obviously he played but he wasn't as good as him numbers say he was at the point because he wasn't playing natural anymore. I count Clemens before his obvious steroid use.
baseball,3dzfli,Mackinacsfuriousclaw,0,Mon Jul 20 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"His performance was every bit the numbers say it was. Trying to correct players' performances to what you think they should be retroactively because of steroid use is futile and revisionist. Baseball's executives allowed those players to play, and so their performance stands as part of baseball's history. Not some edited version where anyone else's idea of justice occurred. If Clemens was better than Kershaw or Greinke while he was on steroids, then that's the way it was. It counts.   I understand that you want to shun those who you feel cheated the game. That makes sense, and I get it. To refuse to acknowledge what actually happened is to say that you get to decide what counts and what doesn't. That's MLB's job."
baseball,3dzfli,Padreschargers7,4,Tue Jul 21 00:51:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not shunning him, I'm saying his performance that season was artificially enhanced which is true. His numbers would have been no where close to what he put up if he didn't have the benefits of steroids. MLB doesn't allow steroid use so its obvious where their feelings on steroid users lay."

baseball,3dzfli,STNbrossy,7,Tue Jul 21 01:45:22 2015 UTC,I waited all year for their series against the Braves this week just to see Kershaw or Greinke and of course the rotation is at the point where neither will take the mound.  I'm heartbroken.
baseball,3dzfli,PlutoniumPa,8,Tue Jul 21 02:08:36 2015 UTC,"That sucks. The past 4 years I've been trying to see Kershaw or Greinke pitch and I missed them every time. Since I live in western Pennsylvania I can only see them play the Pirates, and the 4 times I went to go see them play I was stuck watching Kuroda (he was good), Steven Fife, Rickey Nolasco and Joe Fucking Blanton pitch for us."
baseball,3dzfli,DharmaCub,4,Mon Jul 20 22:31:12 2015 UTC,The last time Kershaw threw in Atlanta I had something I was obligated to for months and there was no way out.  I still seriously considered bailing and just facing the consequences.  This is their only series against the Dodgers here this season.  I've been way too upset about this luck the past few days.  I mainly go to games to see great pitching but the world won't let me see Kershaw who I love (like everybody else).  I wish the Braves still had a legendary pitcher like Maddux in their rotation.

I don't watch a ton of Reds games, but I watch a few, and I feel like I've seen Brandon Phillips do this at least 3 or 4 times this season. Reds fans, can you back me up? Here's at least one other time from about 3 weeks ago; I managed to find the video.  SD@CIN: Phillips' behind-the-back flip starts DP  I'm a huge fan of Phillips and I'm happy he's having a bounce back year. Look at the great effort he made on this headfirst slide to first (great play by Alexei too). 99% percent of the players in the league would have run through and gotten tagged out. Players like Brandon are just great for the league, and great for fans. I really do appreciate guys like Phillips, Harper, Puig, Lawrie, etc... high effort guys. The guys willing to go all out for a base hit.  Video: CIN@CWS: Out call at first overturned in the 4th"

baseball,3e0of3,Mastodon9,8,Tue Jul 21 03:40:08 2015 UTC,3-4 times a season might be a conservative estimate. I feel like he's good for maybe twice that. He ends up on the highlight reel for some kind of stellar defensive play at least about once a week.

baseball,3dyicl,DrBeardyFace,15,Mon Jul 20 20:04:26 2015 UTC,"That was back in July of 2013. Posey was listed as the cleanup hitter on the official lineup card, but on the scoreboard and basically everywhere else, he was listed as batting third. Mattingly knew this and waited until Posey completed his at bat (RBI Double) to argue that he batted out of order. They reviewed the lineup cards and it showed that Sandoval was supposed to bat third and Posey was 4th. So they ruled Sandoval as being out on a 2-U and Posey then batted again in the correct spot, in which he flew out to end the inning. I remember because I was there and it confused just about everybody."

Looked it up, found this:   McClelland: It is a balk if the catcher doesn't stay in the catcher's box until the pitcher delivers the ball. If he were to step out of the catcher's box - the little box behind home plate - before the pitcher delivers the ball it would be called a catcher's balk. The runners would advance.  As a matter of fact, I have never seen it called, it's one of those things you just kind of let slide. But it is in the rule book, we haven't updated the rule book in a long time. If it was called recently, it would be by an umpire taking the rule book to the letter of the law and sometimes we have to kind of overlook some things to make the game run smoother."

baseball,3dyicl,Gyro88,45,Mon Jul 20 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand the rule. I know if the run crosses the plate before the tag is applied, it counts (as opposed to a force out) but this seems to be saying that even though Ethier didn't tag up on a lineout, he was still safe. The article says:   Vanover ruled that the Ethier run counted, even though Ethier had not tagged up, because there was no appeal at third base.   Does that mean that he was allowed to score only because the D-Backs didn't officially point out that he didn't tag up? That seems strange."
baseball,3dyicl,LtDarien,53,Mon Jul 20 17:10:27 2015 UTC,"That's exactly right.  Just like all appeal plays, unless the defense actually makes the appeal, no out is recorded and the play stands."
baseball,3dyicl,crazye97,14,Mon Jul 20 17:27:42 2015 UTC,"That's correct. Because tagging the player is not a force out. Had he tagged the bag instead, it would have been, and the run would not have counted. Had they also tagged third after tagging the runner (or appealed), it also would not have counted, as that out would replace the runner being tagged.  EDIT: Though this can be a bit confusing here as well:   APPROVED RULING: One out, Jones on third, Smith on first, and Brown flies out to right field. Two outs. Jones tags up and scores after the catch. Smith attempted to return to first but the right fielder’s throw beat him to the base. Three outs. But Jones scored before the throw to catch Smith reached first base, hence Jones’ run counts. It was not a force play.   So it should actually be if he had tagged third/appealed, it wouldn't have counted. The tagging of second would likely only have negated the run if it happened before Ethier made it home."
baseball,3dyicl,DrFoosball,223,Mon Jul 20 17:28:27 2015 UTC,The runner can make his own base path if he isn't avoiding a tag.   You could legally run the base paths backwards for a very long single if you wanted. Or you can take a lead off into the outfield if you are already on base.

I first heard of this when someone was explaining a trick 1st and 3rd play where the runner at 1st takes his lead in the outfield in hopes that he will draw a rundown play,allowing the runner on 3rd to score.

baseball,3dyicl,Antithesys,31,Mon Jul 20 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"Keeping in mind that once you're in the rundown, you're now avoiding a tag and you must make a beeline for the base. No dancing around."
baseball,3dyicl,nobadlinks,28,Mon Jul 20 16:36:55 2015 UTC,"No.  You can dance, just has to be along the line from where you are standing to first or to second.  that's the entire point of the skunk play.

If you run backwards off the bat, you're not legally entitled to third or second, so with this wording you could theoretically run the bases backwards until you touch first, at which point you must turn around and go the right way.  This scenario will never happen, though, because to do it you need to be sure you've hit a standup triple. You can't be sure of that as soon as you make contact. If you wait long enough to know that it's going to run the gap, you're taking precious seconds away from your run, and the play at first is going to be a force play regardless of which direction you're coming from."

baseball,3dyicl,MrJigglyBrown,65,Mon Jul 20 19:08:37 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the rulebook is pretty confusing about this.     An INFIELD FLY is a fair fly ball (not including a line drive nor an attempted bunt) which can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort, when first and second, or first, second and third bases are occupied, before two are out.

Some teams can get away with this because they have words on their logos that obscure the baseball.  There are also rules regulating the size of a glove the fielder is permitted to wear, although these aren't really enforced.  1.12 The catcher may wear a leather mitt not more than 38 inches in circumference, nor more than 151/2 inches from top to bottom.  1.13 The first baseman may wear a leather glove or mitt not more than twelve inches long from top to bottom and not more than eight inches wide across the palm, measured from the base of the thumb crotch to the outer edge of the mitt. The space between the thumb section and the finger section of the mitt shall not exceed four inches at the top of the mitt and 31/2 inches at the base of the thumb crotch.  1.14 Each fielder, other than the first baseman or catcher, may use or wear a leather glove. The measurements covering size of glove shall be made by measuring front side or ball receiving side of glove. The tool or measuring tape shall be placed to contact the surface or feature of item being measured and follow all contours in the process. The glove shall not measure more than 12 inches from the tip of any one of the four fingers, through the ball pocket to the bottom edge or heel of glove. The glove shall not measure more than 73/4 inches wide, measured from the inside seam at base of first finger, along base of other fingers, to the outside edge of little finger edge of glove.   These aren't rules, but recommendations about the orientation of the field and foul space behind home plate. A lot of fields ignore these recommendations.  1.04 It is desirable that the line from home base through the pitchers plate to second base shall run East-Northeast. It is recommended that the distance from home base to the backstop, and from the base lines to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction on foul territory shall be 60 feet or more."

The ball was coming in low and inside so he basically kicked the ball thinking he could get first. To my understanding, if it is clear that you lean into a pitch, it is a ball unless you lean into it when it is in the strike zone. I gave the kid first because it was a 3-1 count so it was ball 4 and the coach on the other team thought I couldn't give him ball 4 if he leaned in. He thought the batter cannot walk on a lean in hit by pitch but he can get a ball for it if it is not call 3 already"

baseball,3dyicl,scottyway,10,Mon Jul 20 17:26:34 2015 UTC,"6.02(a) (8.05): Balks  If there is a runner, or runners, it is a balk when:  (1) The pitcher, while touching his plate, makes any motion naturally associated with his pitch and fails to make such delivery;  Rule 6.02(a)(1) Comment (Rule 8.05(a) Comment):  If a left-handed or right-handed pitcher swings his free foot past the back edge of the pitcher’s rubber, he is required to pitch to the batter except to throw to second base on a pick-off play.        (2) The pitcher, while touching his plate, feints a throw to first or third base and fails to complete the throw;        (3) The pitcher, while touching his plate, fails to step directly toward a base before throwing to that base;  Rule 6.02(a)(3) Comment (Rule 8.05(c) Comment): Requires the pitcher, while touching his plate, to step directly toward a base before throwing to that base.  If a pitcher turns or spins off of his free foot without actually stepping or if he turns his body and throws before stepping, it is a balk. A pitcher is to step directly toward a base before throwing to that base and is required to throw (except to second base) because he steps.  It is a balk if, with runners on first and third,the pitcher steps toward third and does not throw, merely to bluff the runner back to third; then seeing the runner on first start for second, turn and step toward and throw to first base.  It is legal for a pitcher to feint a throw to second base.        (4) The pitcher, while touching his plate, throws, or feints a throw to an unoccupied base, except for the purpose of making a play;  Rule 6.02(a)(4) Comment (Rule 8.05(d) Comment): When determining whether the pitcher throws or feints a throw to an unoccupied base for the purpose of making a play, the umpire should consider whether a runner on the previous base demonstrates or otherwise creates an impression of his intent to advance to such unoccupied base.        (5) The pitcher makes an illegal pitch;  Rule 6.02(a)(5) Comment (Rule 8.05(e) Comment): A quick pitch is an illegal pitch. Umpires will judge a quick pitch as one delivered before the batter is reasonably set in the batter's box. With runners on base the penalty is a balk; with no runners on base, it is a ball. The quick pitch is dangerous and should not be permitted.        (6) The pitcher delivers the ball to the batter while he is not facing the batter;        (7) The pitcher makes any motion naturally associated with his pitch while he is not touching the pitcher’s plate;        (8) The pitcher unnecessarily delays the game;  Rule 6.02(a)(8) Comment (Rule 8.05(h) Comment): Rule 6.02(a)(8) (Rule 8.05(h)) shall not apply when a warning is given pursuant to Rule 6.02(c)(8) (Rule 8.02(c)) (which prohibits intentional delay of a game by throwing to fielders not in an attempt to put a runner out).  If a pitcher is ejected pursuant to Rule 6.02(c)(8) (Rule 8.02(c)) for continuing to delay the game, the penalty in Rule 6.02(a)(8) (Rule 8.05(h)) shall also apply. Rule 5.07(c) (Rule 8.04) (which sets a time limit for a pitcher to deliver the ball when the bases are unoccupied) applies only when there are no runners on base.        (9) The pitcher, without having the ball, stands on or astride the pitcher’s plate or while off the plate, he feints a pitch;        (10) The pitcher, after coming to a legal pitching position, removes one hand from the ball other than in an actual pitch, or in throwing to a base;        (11) The pitcher, while touching his plate, accidentally or intentionally has the ball slip or fall out of his hand or glove;        (12) The pitcher, while giving an intentional base on balls, pitches when the catcher is not in the catcher’s box;        (13) The pitcher delivers the pitch from Set Position without coming to a stop.        PENALTY: The ball is dead, and each runner shall advance one base without liability to be put out, unless the batter reaches first on a hit, an error, a base on balls, a hit batter, or otherwise, and all other runners advance at least one base, in which case the play proceeds without reference to the balk.        APPROVED RULING: In cases where a pitcher balks and throws wild, either to a base or to home plate, a runner or runners may advance beyond the base to which he is entitled at his own risk.        APPROVED RULING: A runner who misses the first base to which he is advancing and who is called out on appeal shall be considered as having advanced one base for the purpose of this rule.        Rule 6.02(a)Comment (Rule 8.05 Comment): Umpires should bear in mind that the purpose of the balk rule is to prevent the pitcher from deliberately deceiving the base runner. If there is doubt in the umpire’s mind, the “intent” of the pitcher should govern. However, certain specifics should be borne in mind:  (A) Straddling the pitcher’s rubber without the ball is to be interpreted as intent to deceive and ruled a balk.  (B) With a runner on first base the pitcher may make a complete turn, without hesitating toward first, and throw to second. This is not to be interpreted as throwing to an unoccupied base."

Until I became aware that  4 k's in one inning is indeed possible. If a hitter swings at a 3rd strike and the catcher doesnt catch the ball the runner is free to run to first. And if that runner can beat the catchers throw to first he is safe although TECHNICALLY he struck out thereby making it possible for a pitcher to strike out 4, (or in theory an infinite amount of batters), in one inning."

baseball,3dzp3x,following_eyes,3,Tue Jul 21 06:12:03 2015 UTC,He was good for about 10 innings at the end of 2013. The Dodgers gave him $19.5M in return. They're paying him $9.5M this year to chill on a beach somewhere.
baseball,3dzp3x,hjb389,6,Tue Jul 21 06:48:32 2015 UTC,"They're paying him $9.5M this year to chill on a beach somewhere.   Living the dream. Ripping off the Dodgers, getting paid AND doing nothing"
baseball,3dzp3x,DirtyLukeAndTheBoys,6,Tue Jul 21 13:04:09 2015 UTC,"Daniel Hudson not only had two, but two consecutive Tommy Johns. While he was rehabbing for the first one his UCL tore again. He's now pitching out of the Diamondbacks bullpen and has flashes of his former self."
baseball,3dzp3x,Darkstargir,4,Tue Jul 21 00:19:21 2015 UTC,He's hitting 98mph on the reg and the staff is limiting him to 100 innings.  I have a very positive outlook for Huddy as a 2 to 3 rotation guy.  Some would say his makeup isn't great but his recent spike in velocity is huge.  Huddy can fling.  He's one of the best examples (so far) for a successful double TJ recovery.
baseball,3dzp3x,Imhereforthesports,3,Tue Jul 21 07:37:13 2015 UTC,"Joakim Soria has had two and he's still closing games.  Other than that I don't think anyone really - and no starters that I can find, but Beachy is just coming back from his 2nd and Cory Luebke is rehabbing from his 2nd now.  Jarrod Parker blew out his elbow rehabbing from his 2nd."

baseball,3dzp3x,unittron,-11,Tue Jul 21 18:47:06 2015 UTC,I remember Barves fans telling us we didn't know shit about TJS and they had the answers. How much we were mocked for shutting down Strasburg. So yeah...glad to see your TJS's start to put it back together on other squads. The Barves fucked him. I'm rooting for him.
baseball,3dzp3x,DMVBornDMVRaised,4,Tue Jul 21 02:00:33 2015 UTC,"Yes this one player is just like another completely different player. And Strasburg is the sterling image of health, isn't he? Go fuck yourself you pretentious twat. Also, it's the Braves you illiterate moron."
baseball,3dzp3x,SidBreamTrackTeam,-7,Tue Jul 21 02:29:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Barves have only one single pitcher they ruined with multiple TJS.   And maybe a Strasburg has had a couple of injury issues this year but we're talking oblique stains vs second TJS and they're not even in the organization anymore. And not just ONE pitcher. MULTIPLE pitchers. The Barves fucked up big time.   Btw you sure it's not spelt Barves or even Barfs? That's a definite?"

baseball,3e36m1,RunningJokes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:12 2015 UTC,"They got rid of him because he was an FA lame duck who was seriously losing his defensive skills, it was costing them games and they needed a glove at SS and didn't really have room for him anywhere else.  It wasn't a fire sale or anything, he was dead weight.  And it was ultimately the right move, he only had one good season after 2004."

Granted, it saved money and dumped a vet player at the time, so it does kinda qualify.  After all, the Tigers this year don't look to be going full fire sale right now.  But certainly look to be hoping to reload for '16."
baseball,3e36m1,ibeatoffconstantly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:23 2015 UTC,"No they were just reconstructing their roster for their playoff run. They didn't like Nomar's D at SS and at that deadline they acquired Orlando Cabrera, Doug Mientkwicz and Dave Roberts, 3 excellent defensive players.  Not selling, reloading."
baseball,3dzn01,BJ2K,28,Mon Jul 20 20:43:18 2015 UTC,Those of us who've watched him all this time see him making these plays quite often.  So it really kind of proves the whole thing about getting noticed before you get noticed.  Esky has been making those plays since he's been here and I've never seen him make the top play yet here he makes it 3 times from one game.
baseball,3dzn01,Chelsor,4,Mon Jul 20 22:58:18 2015 UTC,"Making up for lost time. Esky is a fans SS. You don't have to be a Royal homer to recognize his skill. But the casual baseball fan has no idea who he is. I feel like the same thing with Cain. Easily one of the best outfeilders and is giving chase to Trout for MVP. Cain should have been the all-star MVP. Trout deserves every bit of recognition he gets, and if he stays healthy and continues on his trend, he will probably be the greatest to ever play. But still nobody outside of baseball fans know who Cain is. Baseball needs to market it's players better."
baseball,3dzn01,Bogey_Redbud,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:09 2015 UTC,"I have been thinking about that for a while. MLB is awful at marketing its players. The NBA and NFL run laps around the marketing side of things. Even though I think MLB is a lot more fan friendly than those other sports. I appreciate that they post replays quickly for anyone to see for free in high quality. And they don't filter out those replays just for PR purposes. They include things like fights, fans doing weird things, etc."

Good dude, but he constantly brings up the trade to me, saying he still likes it, because Segura is the same as Escobar and Gomez is better than Cain.  If that's your opinion, that's cool, but bringing it up unprompted multiple times, makes me think he's not that cool with it."

Bryce's walk rate is approaching 20% once again, and it's causing him to strike out looking more, because he's expecting to get pitched around.

baseball,3dzfli,Zackadeez,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"Perhaps ""pitched backwards"" is the better term.  He's getting pitches outside of the zone early in the count and inside the zone late, so he's striking out looking a ton because he's not expecting balls in the zone.

If you take a look at Halladay and Lee in 2011, I think you'd see that Kershaw and Greinke are set to exceed their numbers (although I understand we're only a little over than halfway through the season), and no one has put forward a better duo."
baseball,3dzfli,spiffmana,5,Mon Jul 20 22:34:14 2015 UTC,"Kershaw is just past a third of the way to the WAR that Halladay had that season. Greinke may surpass Lee's WAR for 2011, but Kershaw is going to finish below 8.7 this year."

baseball,3dzfli,Dacryphile,6,Mon Jul 20 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"If we are talking about just Duos, then the only one that could really compete with them over the last decade or so would be the Halladay/Lee duo in 2011.    Kershaw is hands down better than Wainwright and Greinke is better than Carpenter.  Kershaw and Greinke are better than Oswalt and you can't really count Roger Clemens seasons once he hit his 40s because he was on steroids at that point in his career."
baseball,3dzfli,Dacryphile,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:00 2015 UTC,"you can't really count Roger Clemens seasons once he hit his 40s because he was on steroids at that point in his career.   Disagree. Dislike it all you want, he was allowed to play. He played, his stats are in the books, and if they didn't want it to count they would've done something about it.  I still think Kershaw and Greinke are better, but to just say Clemens doesn't count is to pretend he wasn't playing. He definitely was."
baseball,3dzfli,paulx441,2,Mon Jul 20 21:04:49 2015 UTC,I meant I'm just saying you can't really count him as a better pitcher than Kershaw or Greinkie during those seasons because his performance was artificially enhanced. Obviously he played but he wasn't as good as him numbers say he was at the point because he wasn't playing natural anymore. I count Clemens before his obvious steroid use.
baseball,3dzfli,Mackinacsfuriousclaw,0,Mon Jul 20 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"His performance was every bit the numbers say it was. Trying to correct players' performances to what you think they should be retroactively because of steroid use is futile and revisionist. Baseball's executives allowed those players to play, and so their performance stands as part of baseball's history. Not some edited version where anyone else's idea of justice occurred. If Clemens was better than Kershaw or Greinke while he was on steroids, then that's the way it was. It counts.   I understand that you want to shun those who you feel cheated the game. That makes sense, and I get it. To refuse to acknowledge what actually happened is to say that you get to decide what counts and what doesn't. That's MLB's job."
baseball,3dzfli,Padreschargers7,4,Tue Jul 21 00:51:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not shunning him, I'm saying his performance that season was artificially enhanced which is true. His numbers would have been no where close to what he put up if he didn't have the benefits of steroids. MLB doesn't allow steroid use so its obvious where their feelings on steroid users lay."

baseball,3dzfli,STNbrossy,7,Tue Jul 21 01:45:22 2015 UTC,I waited all year for their series against the Braves this week just to see Kershaw or Greinke and of course the rotation is at the point where neither will take the mound.  I'm heartbroken.
baseball,3dzfli,PlutoniumPa,8,Tue Jul 21 02:08:36 2015 UTC,"That sucks. The past 4 years I've been trying to see Kershaw or Greinke pitch and I missed them every time. Since I live in western Pennsylvania I can only see them play the Pirates, and the 4 times I went to go see them play I was stuck watching Kuroda (he was good), Steven Fife, Rickey Nolasco and Joe Fucking Blanton pitch for us."
baseball,3dzfli,DharmaCub,4,Mon Jul 20 22:31:12 2015 UTC,The last time Kershaw threw in Atlanta I had something I was obligated to for months and there was no way out.  I still seriously considered bailing and just facing the consequences.  This is their only series against the Dodgers here this season.  I've been way too upset about this luck the past few days.  I mainly go to games to see great pitching but the world won't let me see Kershaw who I love (like everybody else).  I wish the Braves still had a legendary pitcher like Maddux in their rotation.

I don't watch a ton of Reds games, but I watch a few, and I feel like I've seen Brandon Phillips do this at least 3 or 4 times this season. Reds fans, can you back me up? Here's at least one other time from about 3 weeks ago; I managed to find the video.  SD@CIN: Phillips' behind-the-back flip starts DP  I'm a huge fan of Phillips and I'm happy he's having a bounce back year. Look at the great effort he made on this headfirst slide to first (great play by Alexei too). 99% percent of the players in the league would have run through and gotten tagged out. Players like Brandon are just great for the league, and great for fans. I really do appreciate guys like Phillips, Harper, Puig, Lawrie, etc... high effort guys. The guys willing to go all out for a base hit.  Video: CIN@CWS: Out call at first overturned in the 4th"

baseball,3e0of3,Mastodon9,8,Tue Jul 21 03:40:08 2015 UTC,3-4 times a season might be a conservative estimate. I feel like he's good for maybe twice that. He ends up on the highlight reel for some kind of stellar defensive play at least about once a week.

baseball,3dyicl,DrBeardyFace,15,Mon Jul 20 20:04:26 2015 UTC,"That was back in July of 2013. Posey was listed as the cleanup hitter on the official lineup card, but on the scoreboard and basically everywhere else, he was listed as batting third. Mattingly knew this and waited until Posey completed his at bat (RBI Double) to argue that he batted out of order. They reviewed the lineup cards and it showed that Sandoval was supposed to bat third and Posey was 4th. So they ruled Sandoval as being out on a 2-U and Posey then batted again in the correct spot, in which he flew out to end the inning. I remember because I was there and it confused just about everybody."

Looked it up, found this:   McClelland: It is a balk if the catcher doesn't stay in the catcher's box until the pitcher delivers the ball. If he were to step out of the catcher's box - the little box behind home plate - before the pitcher delivers the ball it would be called a catcher's balk. The runners would advance.  As a matter of fact, I have never seen it called, it's one of those things you just kind of let slide. But it is in the rule book, we haven't updated the rule book in a long time. If it was called recently, it would be by an umpire taking the rule book to the letter of the law and sometimes we have to kind of overlook some things to make the game run smoother."

baseball,3dyicl,Gyro88,45,Mon Jul 20 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand the rule. I know if the run crosses the plate before the tag is applied, it counts (as opposed to a force out) but this seems to be saying that even though Ethier didn't tag up on a lineout, he was still safe. The article says:   Vanover ruled that the Ethier run counted, even though Ethier had not tagged up, because there was no appeal at third base.   Does that mean that he was allowed to score only because the D-Backs didn't officially point out that he didn't tag up? That seems strange."
baseball,3dyicl,LtDarien,53,Mon Jul 20 17:10:27 2015 UTC,"That's exactly right.  Just like all appeal plays, unless the defense actually makes the appeal, no out is recorded and the play stands."
baseball,3dyicl,crazye97,14,Mon Jul 20 17:27:42 2015 UTC,"That's correct. Because tagging the player is not a force out. Had he tagged the bag instead, it would have been, and the run would not have counted. Had they also tagged third after tagging the runner (or appealed), it also would not have counted, as that out would replace the runner being tagged.  EDIT: Though this can be a bit confusing here as well:   APPROVED RULING: One out, Jones on third, Smith on first, and Brown flies out to right field. Two outs. Jones tags up and scores after the catch. Smith attempted to return to first but the right fielder’s throw beat him to the base. Three outs. But Jones scored before the throw to catch Smith reached first base, hence Jones’ run counts. It was not a force play.   So it should actually be if he had tagged third/appealed, it wouldn't have counted. The tagging of second would likely only have negated the run if it happened before Ethier made it home."
baseball,3dyicl,DrFoosball,223,Mon Jul 20 17:28:27 2015 UTC,The runner can make his own base path if he isn't avoiding a tag.   You could legally run the base paths backwards for a very long single if you wanted. Or you can take a lead off into the outfield if you are already on base.

I first heard of this when someone was explaining a trick 1st and 3rd play where the runner at 1st takes his lead in the outfield in hopes that he will draw a rundown play,allowing the runner on 3rd to score.

baseball,3dyicl,Antithesys,31,Mon Jul 20 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"Keeping in mind that once you're in the rundown, you're now avoiding a tag and you must make a beeline for the base. No dancing around."
baseball,3dyicl,nobadlinks,28,Mon Jul 20 16:36:55 2015 UTC,"No.  You can dance, just has to be along the line from where you are standing to first or to second.  that's the entire point of the skunk play.

If you run backwards off the bat, you're not legally entitled to third or second, so with this wording you could theoretically run the bases backwards until you touch first, at which point you must turn around and go the right way.  This scenario will never happen, though, because to do it you need to be sure you've hit a standup triple. You can't be sure of that as soon as you make contact. If you wait long enough to know that it's going to run the gap, you're taking precious seconds away from your run, and the play at first is going to be a force play regardless of which direction you're coming from."

baseball,3dyicl,MrJigglyBrown,65,Mon Jul 20 19:08:37 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the rulebook is pretty confusing about this.     An INFIELD FLY is a fair fly ball (not including a line drive nor an attempted bunt) which can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort, when first and second, or first, second and third bases are occupied, before two are out.

Some teams can get away with this because they have words on their logos that obscure the baseball.  There are also rules regulating the size of a glove the fielder is permitted to wear, although these aren't really enforced.  1.12 The catcher may wear a leather mitt not more than 38 inches in circumference, nor more than 151/2 inches from top to bottom.  1.13 The first baseman may wear a leather glove or mitt not more than twelve inches long from top to bottom and not more than eight inches wide across the palm, measured from the base of the thumb crotch to the outer edge of the mitt. The space between the thumb section and the finger section of the mitt shall not exceed four inches at the top of the mitt and 31/2 inches at the base of the thumb crotch.  1.14 Each fielder, other than the first baseman or catcher, may use or wear a leather glove. The measurements covering size of glove shall be made by measuring front side or ball receiving side of glove. The tool or measuring tape shall be placed to contact the surface or feature of item being measured and follow all contours in the process. The glove shall not measure more than 12 inches from the tip of any one of the four fingers, through the ball pocket to the bottom edge or heel of glove. The glove shall not measure more than 73/4 inches wide, measured from the inside seam at base of first finger, along base of other fingers, to the outside edge of little finger edge of glove.   These aren't rules, but recommendations about the orientation of the field and foul space behind home plate. A lot of fields ignore these recommendations.  1.04 It is desirable that the line from home base through the pitchers plate to second base shall run East-Northeast. It is recommended that the distance from home base to the backstop, and from the base lines to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction on foul territory shall be 60 feet or more."

The ball was coming in low and inside so he basically kicked the ball thinking he could get first. To my understanding, if it is clear that you lean into a pitch, it is a ball unless you lean into it when it is in the strike zone. I gave the kid first because it was a 3-1 count so it was ball 4 and the coach on the other team thought I couldn't give him ball 4 if he leaned in. He thought the batter cannot walk on a lean in hit by pitch but he can get a ball for it if it is not call 3 already"

baseball,3dyicl,scottyway,10,Mon Jul 20 17:26:34 2015 UTC,"6.02(a) (8.05): Balks  If there is a runner, or runners, it is a balk when:  (1) The pitcher, while touching his plate, makes any motion naturally associated with his pitch and fails to make such delivery;  Rule 6.02(a)(1) Comment (Rule 8.05(a) Comment):  If a left-handed or right-handed pitcher swings his free foot past the back edge of the pitcher’s rubber, he is required to pitch to the batter except to throw to second base on a pick-off play.        (2) The pitcher, while touching his plate, feints a throw to first or third base and fails to complete the throw;        (3) The pitcher, while touching his plate, fails to step directly toward a base before throwing to that base;  Rule 6.02(a)(3) Comment (Rule 8.05(c) Comment): Requires the pitcher, while touching his plate, to step directly toward a base before throwing to that base.  If a pitcher turns or spins off of his free foot without actually stepping or if he turns his body and throws before stepping, it is a balk. A pitcher is to step directly toward a base before throwing to that base and is required to throw (except to second base) because he steps.  It is a balk if, with runners on first and third,the pitcher steps toward third and does not throw, merely to bluff the runner back to third; then seeing the runner on first start for second, turn and step toward and throw to first base.  It is legal for a pitcher to feint a throw to second base.        (4) The pitcher, while touching his plate, throws, or feints a throw to an unoccupied base, except for the purpose of making a play;  Rule 6.02(a)(4) Comment (Rule 8.05(d) Comment): When determining whether the pitcher throws or feints a throw to an unoccupied base for the purpose of making a play, the umpire should consider whether a runner on the previous base demonstrates or otherwise creates an impression of his intent to advance to such unoccupied base.        (5) The pitcher makes an illegal pitch;  Rule 6.02(a)(5) Comment (Rule 8.05(e) Comment): A quick pitch is an illegal pitch. Umpires will judge a quick pitch as one delivered before the batter is reasonably set in the batter's box. With runners on base the penalty is a balk; with no runners on base, it is a ball. The quick pitch is dangerous and should not be permitted.        (6) The pitcher delivers the ball to the batter while he is not facing the batter;        (7) The pitcher makes any motion naturally associated with his pitch while he is not touching the pitcher’s plate;        (8) The pitcher unnecessarily delays the game;  Rule 6.02(a)(8) Comment (Rule 8.05(h) Comment): Rule 6.02(a)(8) (Rule 8.05(h)) shall not apply when a warning is given pursuant to Rule 6.02(c)(8) (Rule 8.02(c)) (which prohibits intentional delay of a game by throwing to fielders not in an attempt to put a runner out).  If a pitcher is ejected pursuant to Rule 6.02(c)(8) (Rule 8.02(c)) for continuing to delay the game, the penalty in Rule 6.02(a)(8) (Rule 8.05(h)) shall also apply. Rule 5.07(c) (Rule 8.04) (which sets a time limit for a pitcher to deliver the ball when the bases are unoccupied) applies only when there are no runners on base.        (9) The pitcher, without having the ball, stands on or astride the pitcher’s plate or while off the plate, he feints a pitch;        (10) The pitcher, after coming to a legal pitching position, removes one hand from the ball other than in an actual pitch, or in throwing to a base;        (11) The pitcher, while touching his plate, accidentally or intentionally has the ball slip or fall out of his hand or glove;        (12) The pitcher, while giving an intentional base on balls, pitches when the catcher is not in the catcher’s box;        (13) The pitcher delivers the pitch from Set Position without coming to a stop.        PENALTY: The ball is dead, and each runner shall advance one base without liability to be put out, unless the batter reaches first on a hit, an error, a base on balls, a hit batter, or otherwise, and all other runners advance at least one base, in which case the play proceeds without reference to the balk.        APPROVED RULING: In cases where a pitcher balks and throws wild, either to a base or to home plate, a runner or runners may advance beyond the base to which he is entitled at his own risk.        APPROVED RULING: A runner who misses the first base to which he is advancing and who is called out on appeal shall be considered as having advanced one base for the purpose of this rule.        Rule 6.02(a)Comment (Rule 8.05 Comment): Umpires should bear in mind that the purpose of the balk rule is to prevent the pitcher from deliberately deceiving the base runner. If there is doubt in the umpire’s mind, the “intent” of the pitcher should govern. However, certain specifics should be borne in mind:  (A) Straddling the pitcher’s rubber without the ball is to be interpreted as intent to deceive and ruled a balk.  (B) With a runner on first base the pitcher may make a complete turn, without hesitating toward first, and throw to second. This is not to be interpreted as throwing to an unoccupied base."

Until I became aware that  4 k's in one inning is indeed possible. If a hitter swings at a 3rd strike and the catcher doesnt catch the ball the runner is free to run to first. And if that runner can beat the catchers throw to first he is safe although TECHNICALLY he struck out thereby making it possible for a pitcher to strike out 4, (or in theory an infinite amount of batters), in one inning."

baseball,3dzp3x,following_eyes,3,Tue Jul 21 06:12:03 2015 UTC,He was good for about 10 innings at the end of 2013. The Dodgers gave him $19.5M in return. They're paying him $9.5M this year to chill on a beach somewhere.
baseball,3dzp3x,hjb389,6,Tue Jul 21 06:48:32 2015 UTC,"They're paying him $9.5M this year to chill on a beach somewhere.   Living the dream. Ripping off the Dodgers, getting paid AND doing nothing"
baseball,3dzp3x,DirtyLukeAndTheBoys,6,Tue Jul 21 13:04:09 2015 UTC,"Daniel Hudson not only had two, but two consecutive Tommy Johns. While he was rehabbing for the first one his UCL tore again. He's now pitching out of the Diamondbacks bullpen and has flashes of his former self."
baseball,3dzp3x,Darkstargir,4,Tue Jul 21 00:19:21 2015 UTC,He's hitting 98mph on the reg and the staff is limiting him to 100 innings.  I have a very positive outlook for Huddy as a 2 to 3 rotation guy.  Some would say his makeup isn't great but his recent spike in velocity is huge.  Huddy can fling.  He's one of the best examples (so far) for a successful double TJ recovery.
baseball,3dzp3x,Imhereforthesports,3,Tue Jul 21 07:37:13 2015 UTC,"Joakim Soria has had two and he's still closing games.  Other than that I don't think anyone really - and no starters that I can find, but Beachy is just coming back from his 2nd and Cory Luebke is rehabbing from his 2nd now.  Jarrod Parker blew out his elbow rehabbing from his 2nd."

He's had some calls go against him on the basepaths, but his defense looks fine (yes, I know that's reflected in the UZR/DRS).   Let me put it this way: I've watched almost every Marlins game this season, and I hope the Marlins sign Ichiro for next season as their 4th OF / primary PH."
baseball,3e11ap,jigokusabre,4,Tue Jul 21 17:28:48 2015 UTC,"Below replacement level? He's a 4th outfielder and a pincher hitter who's batting .266. And if you wanna get technical his .266 batting average is better then their current 3rd outfielder Yelich.  So Ichiro definitely still brings value to a team, and it's even more surprising your a fan of the Mariners running your mouth about the best player in your franchises history."
baseball,3e11ap,ThisOnesForReal94,6,Tue Jul 21 13:01:33 2015 UTC,"His batting average is also higher than Giancarlo Stanton, Joc Pederson, George Springer, Jose Bautista, Curtis Granderson, Justin Upton, Jay Bruce, and Ryan Braun. Do you think anyone would actually want him over any of those guys?  You guys are being ridiculous. How is it controversial to say Ichiro has not played well recently? He's a corner OF that's slugging .302. He's 41, of course he's not the player he used to be. Nobody is saying he wasn't a great player at one time. I'm sure we'd all like to see him get 3000 hits. The question is simply whether anyone is going to give him the playing time to get there."
baseball,3e11ap,JolIyJack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:29 2015 UTC,"He's 100 hits away with a little less than half a season left. Miami is actively interested in re-signing him for 2016, and since he's been established as a 4th OF, Seattle can sign him to a similar role."

baseball,3e3eh3,bceagle411,2,Tue Jul 21 18:13:31 2015 UTC,"This is a great article. With respect to Bogaerts, I'd note that he got absolutely wrecked by sliders on the outer half last year. This year he's been more aggressive early in counts and he's going to the opposite field more often. This has allowed him to cut his strikeout rate way down (15.1% in 2015 down from 23.2% in 2014).   It has also limited his walk rate and power on contact, but between his massive improvements in the field and against sliders (12.2 runs below average on sliders in 2014, 0.7 runs below average in 2015) I'm optimistic that his game still has some growing to do."

baseball,3e05m3,stuckinthepow,2,Tue Jul 21 05:40:03 2015 UTC,Because who wants to give up something of value for a #3/4 starter set to make $20M next year?
baseball,3e05m3,SouthernDerpfornia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:42:57 2015 UTC,That's the only way I see something working out for us though. Alden has even mentioned it in his latest article about Weaver coming back. It isn't likely for the Angels to trade away controllable talent for a loaner. The only way the Angels make a trade is we trade away Wilson who is owed money and pitching very well for a player who we can control. The team doesn't want any loaners and we can't give up farm talent. Or young pitching talent. It doesn't make any sense in the long run.
baseball,3e05m3,stuckinthepow,6,Tue Jul 21 05:46:56 2015 UTC,Watched him pitch for two years. This sounds about right.
baseball,3e0d83,ClayJay751,14,Tue Jul 21 00:00:20 2015 UTC,"I've tried making something to incorporate a little more ""San Diego"" into the logo. I've added a couple of gaslamp images and a sillouette of the stadium. I got rid of the bow-tie effect, since the Padres ditched that a few years ago. I went with a sand-and brown scheme, since I think it looks better than the gray-and-blue, but not as.... drastic as the chocolate-and-mustard scheme.   http://i.imgur.com/aD5FIiM.jpg"

baseball,3e0d83,JanitorOfSanDiego,19,Tue Jul 21 05:44:17 2015 UTC,"Just makeup on a pig.   The bowtie font is terrible, and had already been removed from the team's aesthetic. The steel beam/construction at the top is not indicative or representative of anything San Diego.   There's a lot of things wrong with the logo they revealed, too much for a simple change in color scheme to address."
baseball,3e0d83,bspoots,15,Tue Jul 21 00:18:14 2015 UTC,The beam structure is supposed to be the gaslamp district signs.  But I agree... a more distinctly brown and yellow padres logo would be fantastic

baseball,3e0d83,mrdov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:56:30 2015 UTC,"Yup. Unfortunately not too many uniquely San Diego things that work well on a logo like that. Anything beach related could still be a handful of teams. The Zoo or Seaworld would be weird on a logo. Gaslamp could work, but it takes a lot more effort than what's in the original logo. I still think the logo should have been the Hotel del Coronado and/or a number 19 lifeguard tower (which I know is beach themed, but the 19 should give it away as SD)."

baseball,3e0d83,EMPtime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I knew that looked wrong woops lol. You're welcome. Think of vector as ""digitized"". Basically, if you're going to be doing things such as fabricating a metal sign (which you're obviously going to be doing with an AS logo) then it needs to be vector so sign machines can mathematically perform tasks such as making cuts/bends and sheets of adhesive vinyl being cut to apply on top for color. Another example is say if you're going to do mass screen printing or embroidering a shirt, it needs to be vector so the machines know how to sew it or what color of ink needs to be layed down and when."

baseball,3dyvrs,IdTugYourBoat,159,Mon Jul 20 19:26:52 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think that people outside of Southern California fully understand this. The lofty ineptitude that takes place on our roads at the first sign of rain is absolutely incredible. I realize that California drivers already have something of a reputation with our traffic and reckless driving but what takes place the second a single drop of water falls from the sky is unreal. It's almost like a parody of bad California driving.   You've got the group of assholes who slow down to a cool 20 MPH on the freeway (speed limit is 65) causing huge backups. You've got the assholes who decide that the rain is the best time to floor it and zip around the first group of assholes at 85 MPH. These people seem to have more faith in their brakes than the Pope has in Christ because they will decide to tap their brakes only when they're about 8 inches from the rear bumper of another car.   Then you've got the dickheads who treat a light drizzle as if it's Hurricane Katrina and proceed with so much caution that they turn a 10 minute drive into a 12 hour experience. These people can make a fucking career of making a right hand turn. Also, they don't accelerate when the light turns green, they just reluctantly take their foot off of the brake and let the car roll forward, slamming their brakes if the car begins to approach 2 MPH.   Inevitably one of these morons (or the countless other groups of dipshits that I don't have the patience to mention) will cause an accident on the 405. This leads to one of the most infuriating acts of driving since the first automobile rolled off of the assembly line, rubbernecking. For those who don't know, rubbernecking is when there's an accident off to the side of the freeway which causes traffic to slow to a crawl (and often completely stop) in both directions because these assholes have to slow down to look at the accident. If there's a crash on the 605 north then traffic is going to be stopped on the 605 north and south because people traveling the opposite direction still want to see why there are EMS lights flashing on the other side of the freeway and therefore peek over the center divider. I know that rubbernecking isn't unique to Southern California but here in the Golden State is where it has been perfected as an art form. It will slow traffic for miles in both directions and when this is coupled with the groups of assholes mentioned above, it's enough to make you want to just leave your car sitting on the freeway and walk home since it would be quicker and less infuriating.   Mind you, the accident isn't actually blocking any traffic. It's off to the shoulder and therefore it leaves every lane wide open. Also, the accidents are usually nothing more than a fender bender. One car tapped another from behind going a few miles an hour resulting in nothing more than maybe a broken tail light and busted up bumper. That doesn't matter. People still need to see this and take out their phones to snap pictures for the Gram because their lives are so void of anything interesting that turning a 15 minute drive into a 3 hour excursion means nothing to them so long as they get to see someone's day ruined.   And how the hell could I forget the news? With such headlines as STORMWATCH 2015!!! and LIGHTNING STORMS THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHLAND!!! and the use of the MEGA DOPPLER 7000+ HD!!!!!!!, the local news treats rain as though it's Armageddon itself and some old and vengeful god has decided to unleash his wrath on Southern California's highways. These STORMWATCHES usually involve some idiot in a poncho standing in Hollywood talking about puddles. They then cut to some other idiot in a rain coat in Santa Ana talking about puddles and finally some idiot in Riverside wearing a different colored poncho talking about puddles. God forbid the rain lasts more than a couple of days because then you've got some different idiot ""on scene"" down near San Diego talking about how ""the storm is spreading"" as if it's a bad rash or something. We get it, clouds move. This isn't news and I don't need your stock footage of cars driving down Santa Monica boulevard during a drizzle every 10 minutes.   Yeah, I wrote almost 1,000 words on the shocking and palpable ineptitude on Southern California during a storm and I could probably write 100,000 more. Somehow rain turns Los Angeles, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego into some sort of insane carnival of ineptitude. I know I've used that word a lot but it's the only way to explain it. Ineptitude.   Most of you probably didn't read this novel and if you did, you think I'm exaggerating. I'm not. If anything, I left quite a bit out and just covered the tip of the iceberg and I think I safely speak for anyone in this thread with an Angels, Padres, or Dodgers flair when I say that Southern California drivers in the rain is something that has to be experienced to believe. It's honestly not even worth getting in your car unless you absolutely have to and if you have blood pressure medication handy.   I once saw some sort of documentary on chimps and gorillas where they tried to teach them how to drive a car with an automatic transmission. Those monkeys look like NASCAR drivers when compared to the idiots who get behind the wheel during a light rain down here. It's fucking unbelievable.   tl;dr Ineptitude  Edit: This is by far the most I've ever written in a Reddit comment and I'm trying to keep it brief. You seriously cannot comprehend how terrible our drivers are in the rain. It's absolutely unreal.  Edit 2: To the person who gifted me gold, thank you! The fact that you got a kick out of this to where you gilded me seriously made my week. Now I'm going to poke in and out of /r/baseball all day (I usually do that anyway) and gild someone who leaves a great comment. You know, pay it forward. Again, thank you and thank God the sun is out today! I know we need the rain but I also need to drive from Long Beach to Hollywood later tonight and I'd like to finish the drive this week.   Also, thanks to /u/rex_llama for making me laugh and reminding me about the Mega Doppler. Our local news is about as terrible and amusingly absurd as our drivers in the rain. For a classic display of the quality of news that we've come to expect here in SoCal, check out the sports segment whenever the Kings or the Ducks are doing well. It's like the newscasters have no idea that hockey exists. If you asked them to give a report on one of those old Mesoamerican ball games it would be more accurate than them trying to tell you what happened during the second period of a Kings/Ducks game.  I think they've used the Sacramento Kings logo more times than the Los Angeles Kings logo. There's the local legend that is Anze Kopidor and Brad Doty passing the ball around. For those of you who don't follow hockey, that should be Anze Kopitar and Drew Doughty. Easy mistake though, they're only two of the best players on the one hockey team in Los Angeles. It's certainly asking too much for the sports report to correctly name the top offensive and defensive players on the local team.    Seriously folks, come move to LA or OC. There's never a dull moment. I love this circus of a town."

This is just some loon ranting about his lifelong hatred of the Californian driver so I'm skeptical but then again, I didn't expect much of a reaction to this post one way or the other, let alone gold. Just goes to show what I know.   I'm glad (and terribly sorry) that you got to see what we have to experience here whenever it rains. It obviously has to do with the fact that it rains so infrequently here and with the drought it's just that much worse. It is absolutely unreal how bad it gets here.   I know this was just a silly rant but honestly, there's some truth to it and it feels good that someone not from here has experienced it and can validate what I'm saying.  I've driven all over the U.S. several times and I've probably been caught in bad weather 3 dozen times. I've driven through lightning storms in New Mexico, snowfall in Connecticut, hail in Texas, and torrential downpours in forests in Oregon and Washington. In conditions way worse than a thunderstorm these people managed to drive safely yet reasonably. If we got snow in Los Angeles the freeways would look like a scene out of Mad Max by the time everything had settled. I swear to God at the first sign of snow I'm just going to gather my loved ones, stock up on supplies, and wait it out in one of those old nuclear bomb shelters from the 60's. Once the skies clear I'll surface, rally the survivors, and we'll do our best to rebuild society as it once was."

I thought, damn this must be a crazy accident because as I said it took two hours to travel about 5 miles. Finally approach the accident and I am excited to check it out. Its a California thing where instead of thinking OH my Gosh I hope they are okay we like to discover what idiot did what to cause all this traffic. However all of a sudden the traffic speeds up again and there is no ambulance of firetruck blocking off the lanes. And then I see. A semi truck flipped over and another car severely damaged. The surprise was that this accident was across two dividers and on the otherside of the freeway. Our lanes were just fine and dandy but I had to add an additional 2 hours of driving on top of the 9 hours so people could slow down to ""ooh!"" and ""aah"" an accident that was NOT EVEN ON OUR SIDE OF THE FREEWAY!"

I can't remember what station that guy is on, just his absurd name and hilariously bad tan. Or maybe it's Kaj Goldberg.

baseball,3dyvrs,necropaw,4,Mon Jul 20 20:16:55 2015 UTC,"Is it a stereotype for Californians to drive stick? I may be out of the loop on this.   For what it's worth, I actually learned to drive using a manual transmission since a car with a manual transmission was the only car that my parents had when I got my driving permit. Since then I've owned a couple of cars that have been stick as well but for the last couple of years I've only driven an automatic. I'll say this as to why: As much as I love driving a stick over an auto for the ""feel"" of it, an automatic is just so much easier in our bullshit traffic. For those familiar with the area (and if not consult Google maps for a reference), I live in Long Beach and used to work in Downtown LA on 3rd and La Cienega Blvd. which is about 30 miles. There are days where, I kid you not, it took me close to 3 hours to get home. 30 miles in 3 hours. That should give you a rough idea as to how bad our traffic truly can be. Just being able to switch between ""stop"" and ""go"" without having to downshift or go into neutral is nice, especially when traffic is so bad that you consider pulling into LAX and buying a ticket to Long Beach Airport and then walking home from there since it would be quicker and quite possibly cheaper considering gas is $4.50 a gallon.   So again, I don't know if it's a stereotype that we only use automatics but if it is, I'd guess it's because of our ungodly traffic (which is compounded a hundred times over by a light drizzle).   I hate stereotypes but every single horror story you've heard about California traffic is not only true, it's probably an under exaggeration.   Oh, and just in case anyone was wondering. If I could make that 30 mile drive in an hour and a half it was considered a good day to the point where it put me in a good mood.   ""Hey! I left at 8:30 and got in at 10! Today is my day!""  I love this state and I plan to live here for as long as possible (partly because I don't want to leave my Angels) but sweet God in Heaven do I fucking hate our traffic."

baseball,3dyvrs,facemelt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:19 2015 UTC,"Much appreciated. Yeah man, it was absolutely awful. The biggest problem is that there's no real direct freeway to that area. I could take the 10 and get somewhat close but that traffic was usually backed up so horribly that it would add another 45 minutes to my already incredibly long commute.   I basically just had to take the 405 to the La Cienega exit next to LAX and just drive straight down La Cienega for what felt like days. The nice thing was that the company eventually moved to an office in Beverly Hills off of Robertson which gave me a far more direct route via the freeway. I could then just take the 405 to the dreaded 10 freeway but take the first exit and surface streets for just a few minutes.  Somehow that small move (only about 7 minutes from the original office) saved me about a half hour going into work every day. Our freeway systems are so bizarre to me. It's so odd that a slight change in my route could save me so much time.   Oh well. The company unfortunately had some cutbacks and laid off a few departments. After I got the ax, I found a job in Long Beach. It's so nice to not have to wake up 3-4 hours before I have to start work."

Sometimes I think the only way to fix our freeway problems is to just carpet bomb the ever living shit out of them and start over from scratch. That's probably why I don't have a degree in urban planning.   Seriously, it's awesome to hear that there are some Southern California residents who are working to fix the problem.

baseball,3dyvrs,lukotheboss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:36:45 2015 UTC,"I actually did from time to time. The only reason that I didn't take it regularly was because A. it still took a couple of hours to get there and B. while at the office I would sometimes need my car since I met with clients once or twice a week in Santa Monica or the surrounding cities. I didn't want to risk being late to a meeting just because a bus was late or someone jumped on the tracks or something. On the days I didn't have to meet with anyone, however, I would occasionally take the Blue Line. It's always nice to be able to just read a book and doze off while on your way to work.  My life did get better though. My best friend who just so happens to also be my roommate was relocated to Santa Monica for his job which meant that he and I could share a car and commute together. That carpool lane is a gift from God."

baseball,3dyvrs,JRoch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:36:23 2015 UTC,The problem he has is depleting the air around him which will make it harder and harder to maintain a hover as the air pressure drops. It will eventually cause the pressure to drop so much that he'll crash

baseball,3dyvrs,jrhii,3,Tue Jul 21 00:28:32 2015 UTC,"Don't ground effect forces come into play here, increasing his lift to drag?  Depleting the air around him?  more air just enters from the air above him to fill the void.  Any sort of pressure change should happen very quickly.  There will be a high pressure area below from the effects of the wings, and low about for the same reason, which is exactly why a helicopter flies in the first place.  From what I understand, pilots first learn to hover close to the ground before moving out of ground effect zone where hovering become more difficult due to the potential formation of a ring vortex around the rotors, which can cause a dead zone and a rapid loss of lift."

baseball,3dyvrs,Fuckballer,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"Okay well the first link I found was way off.  It was an estimate on operating an old Huey today.  The one the Angels are using isn't old and it's not a Huey, but it's not a tiny helicopter like one of those little Robinsons.  Best I can tell is it's probably under $1000 per hour, but that's still a lot of money.  I guess if you're a big league team having it out there for a few hours is a minor expense even if it was $3000 per hour.  You'd think there'd be a better solution than that, though."

When Gary, Keith and Ron (where the fuck has he been the last few weeks?) are on, they give you expert analysis without some of the homerism that other booths suffer from. Plus, they have great senses of humor. The best is when someone makes a joke and the guys are just silent because they had to turn off their mics to hide the laughter.

baseball,3dxv8w,dzfooty,118,Mon Jul 20 15:18:00 2015 UTC,"Keith may have been a baseball player but he really hates the modern game. He's very much an old-school guy and gets easily annoyed when players get basic fundamentals wrong (which is common when you do Mets games). Whereas baseball is life for broadcasters like Vin Scully, Keith is just doing it for the paycheck. If he were paid what current baseball players make he would've never needed to take up a job as a broadcaster for extra income. To him, broadcasting is just a job and he wants to spend as little time working as possible. Keith usually has dinner plans in every city he visits so he doesn't like it when bad baseball ruins his plans or wastes his time. Just imagine being a 60-year-old worker at a desk job being asked to work overtime by your employer - you'd get angry and possibly consider retirement.   Keith also has no filter so his criticism of Mets players is well-known. He almost got into a physical fight with Jose Reyes on a charter flight several years ago over comments he made.   This all makes Keith entertaining to listen to because he's like the broadcast version of Al Bundy."
baseball,3dxv8w,merlin401,43,Mon Jul 20 15:42:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think Keith hates the job, I think he just has no tolerance for teams who don't play the game the right way.  If the Mets played the game to his specification, I think he'd love every minute of it.  Long live Keith, Ron and Gary!"
baseball,3dxv8w,obgynkenobi,31,Mon Jul 20 17:18:49 2015 UTC,I think the fight with Reyes was because Keith asked him to help him move.

baseball,3dxv8w,PhilipK_Dick,7,Mon Jul 20 17:08:58 2015 UTC,Someone should pair him with Marty Brennaman. Marty could tell the audience what each player is doing wrong and Keith could sigh and redirect the conversation to a new complaint about food or the booth.
baseball,3dxv8w,mike_rotch22,8,Mon Jul 20 16:56:12 2015 UTC,Quality post. You'll hear 2-3 Keith sighs even during a 9 inning Mets game.

If your bat is that good, teams really wouldn't care about your glove. I mean maybe if you just didn't know how to catch. Like literally couldn't catch a ball if your life depended on it, then that is the only way I think it is possible."

baseball,3e0iq6,KaufKaufKauf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:46:14 2015 UTC,"My point isn't that Travis D'arnaud would definitely make a good DH or will go on to be a good MLB hitter.  But he could have a bunch of injuries as a result of his catching, and as a result maybe we will never find out what his potential as a hitter is."

baseball,3e0iq6,sickgrof,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:52:42 2015 UTC,"d'Arnaud rakes, that's why."
baseball,3e0iq6,KaufKaufKauf,3,Tue Jul 21 02:21:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he won't ever be able to, but he really hasn't.   103 wRC+ in 108 games last season and yes, he has a 145 wRC+ in 19 games this season prior to all his injuries, but that's way too small a sample to definitively say ""He rakes"" and that he'd be able to be a competent DH. Going to need a bit more than 19 games and 77 PA's to say he can rake."
baseball,3e0iq6,sickgrof,0,Tue Jul 21 02:30:34 2015 UTC,"Last season was weighed down by his bad start being fresh into the league. From the time he was called back up in July until the end of the season, he led all MLB catchers in several offensive categories."
baseball,3e0iq6,artvandelay1994,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:44:47 2015 UTC,He's more known for being an offensive catcher than a defensive one

baseball,3e0iq6,artvandelay1994,2,Tue Jul 21 02:21:47 2015 UTC,"Given offense is his strong suit, he could primarily be a DH if he played for an AL team, thus avoiding injuries."
baseball,3e0iq6,KaufKaufKauf,8,Tue Jul 21 02:28:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on how strong his offense is, right now nobody can seriously say he can hit enough to be a DH."
baseball,3e0iq6,artvandelay1994,2,Tue Jul 21 02:32:15 2015 UTC,"His stats say otherwise. At least for this season, he's been a fantastic hitter when healthy."

All I said was that he has not hit well enough over a reasonable amount of games to say that he rakes or that he can be a competent DH.   But please, do call me back at the end of next season once he gets a good amount of ABs and act like you won the argument if he does in fact do well."
baseball,3e0iq6,artvandelay1994,2,Tue Jul 21 05:04:02 2015 UTC,Relax. I was barely arguing with you.
baseball,3e0iq6,BluePenguin90,17,Tue Jul 21 11:19:07 2015 UTC,"This is baseball. There are other aspects than just hitting. I'm sure some of the greatest fielding players of all time never made it because they couldn't hit a curveball, but I don't see anyone crying over that. You can't field a ground ball, or catch a pop up? You don't deserve to be in the show."

baseball,3e0iq6,cteez910,5,Tue Jul 21 01:45:47 2015 UTC,"Pitchers should hit.  They are penned into the lineup right when they come into the game.  They should be prepared to hit, but if the manager doesnt want them to then sub em out."
baseball,3e0iq6,SaddestClown,2,Tue Jul 21 01:54:35 2015 UTC,I agree they should hit but most of the time they shouldn't field.
baseball,3e0iq6,cteez910,6,Tue Jul 21 02:16:53 2015 UTC,What do you mean? They field their position every time they go out. Pitcher.
baseball,3e0iq6,SaddestClown,4,Tue Jul 21 02:33:42 2015 UTC,I mean stop ruining perfect double play balls by instinctively reaching for them.
baseball,3e0iq6,14bikes,3,Tue Jul 21 02:45:08 2015 UTC,"Sometimes those same double play balls would be a single up the middle if they don't reach for them. They are the closest fielder to the batter in fair ground. Many of them happen in self defense, rather than intention to field."
baseball,3e0iq6,Seven-Three,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:48:52 2015 UTC,"Went to a minor league game last night and saw a pitcher do this not once but twice.  I wanted to strangle him.  Just because you can get the tip of your glove on the chopper by diving for it, doesn't mean the shortstop isn't 10 feet behind you, feet planted, ready to make the play.  Just stop already."

baseball,3e0iq6,GracefulShutdown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:16 2015 UTC,"And to think, he almost ended up on a team with the DH, but we already had our future all-star catcher in JP Arencibia and didn't need him.  :'( This game isn't fun."

baseball,3dztod,JolIyJack,8,Mon Jul 20 21:55:22 2015 UTC,"Indeed - glad to see him succeed. And damn, it feels like giving up Rizzo, which was somewhat understandable at the time I suppose, is going to sting for a really long time. Though the way we've been for the past few years, he might have just rotted here otherwise."
baseball,3dztod,SunriseSurprise,6,Tue Jul 21 00:44:02 2015 UTC,I remember when he couldn't even touch left handed pitching. What a stud.
baseball,3dztod,Sephiroth007,9,Mon Jul 20 23:05:58 2015 UTC,"It's really quite unfortunate for him that he's probably always going to be overshadowed by Goldy, Harper, and Stanton for the NL MVP."

Anybody that's been watching closely feel encouraged to chime in.  This guy is a stud-probably my favorite player on the cubs' roster!"
baseball,3dztod,HauckPark,3,Tue Jul 21 04:03:01 2015 UTC,"It's kind of all of the above. His two strike approach is, in my mind, the most significant change in his game that has led to his success this year. Chokes up, searches for contact and finds it somehow. Also, HBP, he's taken 19 so far ... in second is Alex Gordon with 12. He is the most hit batter in the ML because he stands so damn close to the plate.

baseball,3dylck,davewashere,2,Tue Jul 21 00:23:05 2015 UTC,This is why they haven't yet replaced umpires.   The computers are super close to being able to do it... But sometimes they go whack.
baseball,3dylck,Pearberr,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:43:12 2015 UTC,"Well, umpires go whack pretty much every game. If a computer is right 99% of the time, that's all you expect. Also, with umps still on the field, a haywire computer could easily be replaced by traditional ball/strike calls until the computer is back up.  There really is no good reason for MLB to not seriously consider electronic strike zones."
baseball,3dylck,cozeners,2,Tue Jul 21 02:37:58 2015 UTC,"Well the argument is that several nuances would be lost, such as a Pitcher & Catchers ability to adjust to an umpire's strike zone and such as long-held standards such as larger zones on 3-0 and smaller zones on 0-2, among others.   But no, there is no way to say that computers are not more accurate."
baseball,3dylck,Pearberr,0,Tue Jul 21 03:24:52 2015 UTC,"Those are not nuances, those are major game flaws that need correcting. It's kind of like requiring the defensive team to get 4 outs per inning if they are winning by 10 runs or more. The umps are basically changing the rules for no good reason.  Unless there is a rule in the rule book that says the strike zone is required to be bigger on 3-0, then those things need to be corrected."
baseball,3dylck,cozeners,3,Tue Jul 21 03:46:56 2015 UTC,"The umps are not basically changing the rules, human nature affects officiating just like it affects anything else.   And you cannot simply dismiss that argument as a major game flaw. Tell me why the game is higher quality without the human element.   I don't disagree with you by the way. I am completely on the fence. I just don't think either side has a convincing argument, and ultimately, the MLB will do what is best for business."
baseball,3dylck,Pearberr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:15:12 2015 UTC,"The problem is that balls and strikes are considered ""judgment calls"". While that may be true for humans, it's not true for computers. A computer knows if a pitch is high enough, or too low, or too far outside, etc. So these ""judgement calls"" would then become basically black and white, similar to what we have with instant replay. Although instant replay is not perfect, it's very effective in ensuring there are no really bad calls.  An electronic strike zone would accomplish the same thing.  Also, I believe with an electronic strike zone that the zone should be increased in size. Not by a lot, but by enough to ensure we still have that ""painting the black"" that many pitchers benefit from."
baseball,3dylck,cozeners,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:18 2015 UTC,"I know what a judgement call is and that's not my point.   You have yet to explain why a dynamic, human strike zone is worse than a black and white strike zone. I've never heard it explained why a very precise strike zone is better than the current model."
baseball,3dylck,Pearberr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:57 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to imply anything about your point. I was simply making my case that I think as few judgement calls as possible should be in the game. For example, there's a reason why they added instant replay.  You actually answered your own question when you said:   I've never heard it explained why a very precise strike zone is better than the current model.   The answer is: Because it's a very precise strike zone.  Also I have no problem with the fact that the zone is not ""precise"". What I have a problem with is that it's not the same lack of precision for every team. If the umpires had a 95% rate of consistency (not accuracy; consistency) then I would have no problem keeping the zone the way it is. The problem is not accuracy, it's consistency. But, sadly, computer-induced accuracy is the only way to ensure consistency."
baseball,3dylck,cozeners,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:46:00 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who doesn't EVER want to see umpires replaced for calling balls and strikes? I enjoy having a human back there :/
baseball,3dylck,slapcat1337,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:23:12 2015 UTC,"I enjoy it too. But I want the calls to be more accurate and, more importantly, more consistent.  Also, there's no reason for the umps to not be there. My position is as follows:  The HP ump will have an earpiece. When the pitch gets tracked, which happens immediately like on PitchTrax, it beeps once for a ball, twice for a strike. He simply calls whatever he hears in his ear piece. It would basically be the same as what we see now. If he doesn't hear anything, then that means he has the power to make the judgement call himself, so he'd still have to be alert.  I think this is a reasonable way to implement it. The human factor would still be present and the calls would be more accurate."

In 262 IP in the minors his ERA was 3.48, so a run plus higher than his early majors time and a run lower than what he is over these last ten games.  Taken into consideration a slightly higher ERA with a jump up in leagues, these last ten games would be what he is, or about what he should have been when he made the jump to the majors.  Maybe not a full run though.  I don't think these last en games are who he is but I'm not sure his first year is either."

baseball,3e2pes,mike_rotch22,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:42 2015 UTC,"Could be a combination of things, but most likely it's the effects of the TJ surgery. Look at Adam Wainwright:  2010: 20-11, 2.42 ERA, 230.1 IP, 1.051 WHIP, 160 ERA+, 2.86 FIP. Average fastball velocity in 2010 was 93.5  2012: 14-13, 3.94 ERA, 198.2 IP, 1.248 WHIP, 96 ERA+, 3.10 FIP.

Watching him last night, it seemed like he really had trouble controlling his changeup and slider. I'm not sure if this has been a recurring issue but if so, guys can just sit fastball and not worry about the off-speed. My guess is he will regain control of that in time as he comes back from surgery, and get dominant once again."

baseball,3e34c9,HauckPark,10,Tue Jul 21 18:40:39 2015 UTC,It's the catcher's job to catch the ball every delivery. Receiving the ball is inherent in the position and pitch framing is a corollary of that. A player in soccer/hockey/football is supposed to be strong or evasive enough not to be taken down by the defense. Purposefully flopping is the opposite of their responsibility and goes against the spirit of the game. That's the distinction I see and it makes a big difference to me.
baseball,3e34c9,WillyBoy69,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:12 2015 UTC,"This is definitely the best answer here, you gotta catch the ball so you might as well catch properly as a catcher."
baseball,3e34c9,ohgodmyface,6,Tue Jul 21 17:57:25 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting thought.   I think the main difference is that framing isn't about tricking an ump into believing that a bad pitch was actually good, but rather helping your pitcher get the borderline calls to to his way.  I can remember a few times (small sample, subjective evidence, I know) where a catcher received a pitch poorly and had a strike called as a ball.  I think the real question would be if it's gamesmanship or cheating to pretend that a pitch hit you if it did not, in fact, make contact."
baseball,3e34c9,thedeejus,5,Tue Jul 21 16:26:25 2015 UTC,"There was that ""best pitch that was called a ball"" post a few days ago.  The catcher was set up inside to a righty, the pitch was right down the middle but the catcher had to lunge way to his right to catch it and it legit looked like a ball.  The way a catcher catches a pitch can have a huge influence on how it's called and it's very much part of the game."
baseball,3e34c9,slorebath,5,Tue Jul 21 17:26:27 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's also because one ball or strike, in the grand scheme of a game, aren't as big as say a foul in the box in soccer."
baseball,3e34c9,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Tue Jul 21 16:27:05 2015 UTC,"Aren't they the same thing, that is, efforts to deceive the umpires to make a bad call?   Absolutely not. First, there is no element of deception in pitch framing: the process is extremely transparent. Second, the rulebook zone is bigger than the traditionally-called zone. Therefore, pitch framing is primarily about helping the umpires make the right call.  The baseball equivalent to flopping would be a batter who overreacts to getting hit painlessly or who pretends to get hit. Catchers really don't have any equivalent because they can't react in any way that would suggest to the umpire that an event happened. Maybe if they threw the ball around the horn on a check-swing or something?"

baseball,3dz368,cats_just_in_space,30,Mon Jul 20 19:46:28 2015 UTC,Might snag that division!
baseball,3dz368,JohnnyWaffleseed,27,Mon Jul 20 21:00:41 2015 UTC,Well I would hope for Cardinals fans that he is more likely to see time at 2nd and 3rd base too. Pure single hitters aren't too valuable.
baseball,3dz368,AshleyBlueHerself,13,Mon Jul 20 18:29:28 2015 UTC,Still a better player than Kozma

baseball,3dz368,Rapture00,2,Mon Jul 20 22:37:46 2015 UTC,/u/Bravo_delta fite me irl
baseball,3dz368,hate4dayz,20,Tue Jul 21 14:58:27 2015 UTC,"He hit 15 in the minors in 2013 and had 11 this season in 372 PAs this season, which would put him on pace for 19 in 650 PAs. He's not a slugger, but he does have a decent OBP and he hits a solid number of doubles, too."
baseball,3dz368,AshleyBlueHerself,17,Mon Jul 20 18:33:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, I was only joking. He's a very polished player who was major league ready last year. Plus he went to Stanford (once a Cardinal always a Cardinal I guess) and recently finished up his degree. Easy guy to root for even if he plays for St. Louis."
baseball,3dz368,galenb,9,Mon Jul 20 18:46:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, fair enough. He did play third at Stanford before the Cardinals converted him to an outfielder, so it wouldn't surprise me if they worked with him at third so he could spell Carpenter for a game or two if need be.  Not sure how I feel about him going to first, though. He's only spent a few games there. I know it's considered the easiest position to play, but there's still a decent amount of information to learn."
baseball,3dz368,da_choppa,10,Mon Jul 20 18:57:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, he kinda HAS to play first. We have quite the logjam in the outfield at the moment; Grichuk, Holliday, Heyward, Bourjos, Jay when he's off the DL, and Pham (although he's probably being sent down). Meanwhile, we have Dan Johnson and Mark Reynolds to choose from at first. Pretty clear what position needs more help."
baseball,3dz368,Ihateunerds,4,Mon Jul 20 20:15:25 2015 UTC,"I mean, I understand that he has to. And I think we need the offensive help, but I just don't know how well it'll play out. Given how limited his exposure to first is, it could end badly. I'm hoping he's picked up enough he can manage at first and can be a spark for the team. I was hoping Reynolds would be okay at first (his power's come through a few times, and he's played surprisingly decent defense), but it's hard to compensate for his low average and high strikeout rates."
baseball,3dz368,zachalicious,3,Mon Jul 20 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"No reason they couldn't move Matt Carpenter to first and put Piscotty at third if Piscotty turns out to be a bad first baseman. For the record, I think he will be fine there, but I also heard that Piscotty has one of the best arms in the Cardinals system; it's not a stretch to believe he might even be better at third than Carpenter. In short, they have options."
baseball,3dz368,sparty09,3,Mon Jul 20 23:10:32 2015 UTC,I think it's far more likely Dan Johnson is the one going down.

baseball,3dz368,Colonelcool125,2,Mon Jul 20 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's not wildly exciting. Still, this year he's got an ISO of .203 compared to the PCL average of .142, that's something. It's the most power he's shown in his minor league career so it's either a sign of progress or it's an anomalous couple months. Cards fans are within their rights to hope for the former."
baseball,3dz368,Genetalia69,2,Mon Jul 20 20:32:35 2015 UTC,"He started off really slow at Memphis this year, but he's really heated up the last month or so. His last ten games he hit .361."
baseball,3dz368,Theta_Omega,-6,Mon Jul 20 20:39:03 2015 UTC,It wasn't a joke. He or she meant 2nd or 3rd defensively would be better positions for Piscotty since they don't require a player to hit for as much power.
baseball,3dz368,JohnnyWaffleseed,12,Mon Jul 20 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"You sure? Pretty sure its a play on the title, ""piscotty to see time at first"", as though he were to only hit singles."

baseball,3dz368,Theta_Omega,6,Mon Jul 20 20:35:49 2015 UTC,"Glad to see someone replacing Reynolds finally. I was kinda hoping they'd teach Holliday first and make room in the outfield, but this works too."
baseball,3dz368,helpimnaked,6,Mon Jul 20 19:32:41 2015 UTC,"Holliday to first makes so much sense. The Cards still believe in Matt Adams' future. But with that 'extend Holliday' talk and his bat holding up admirably, it seems like he should 1st."

baseball,3dz368,Theta_Omega,12,Tue Jul 21 02:37:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly, when we had Reynolds the fanbase was pretty split on him. But he did EXACTLY what he was expected to do. Play good defense at first, strikeout a bunch and hit home runs. I wish we would've resigned him. But Lind has been a blessing"
baseball,3dz368,Vanscoten,7,Mon Jul 20 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"He has a sub-.300 OBP and a wRC+ of 90. Those are pretty bad for a first baseman. Yes, he's been a fine stopgap, but with Adams out long-term, he's not just a utility guy off the bench anymore. The Cards need better production from his spot."
baseball,3dz368,KIRB__STOMP,5,Mon Jul 20 23:10:08 2015 UTC,"Adams was playing even worse when he started. Reynolds has been doing just fine. The Cardinals are the best team and baseball, and Reynolds has been doing the best he can. It's hard to satisfy Cardinal fans if players aren't hitting .300."
baseball,3dz368,TheSystemer,7,Mon Jul 20 23:20:51 2015 UTC,It's one thing if a center fielder has a 90 wRC+. First basemen should do better.
baseball,3dz368,SwagNoodle,3,Mon Jul 20 23:38:30 2015 UTC,Adams is also expected to be better going forward than Reynolds. And just because a team is in first with a weak spot in their roster doesn't mean they shouldn't try an upgrade.

Is Puig next? Where Puig used to be untouchable because of his tremendous ability, the Dodgers don’t seem to feel that way now. Would they move him for a pitcher? And would the Phillies take him in a Cole Hamels package?   There are no sources.

baseball,3e0xkc,collegemathchef,18,Tue Jul 21 05:28:26 2015 UTC,"First, Maddux was convinced no hitter could tell the speed of a pitch with any meaningful accuracy. To demonstrate, he pointed at a road a quarter-mile away and said it was impossible to tell if a car was going 55, 65 or 75 mph unless there was another car nearby to offer a point of reference.  “You just can’t do it,” he said. Sometimes hitters can pick up differences in spin. They can identify pitches if there are different releases points or if a curveball starts with an upward hump as it leaves the pitcher’s hand. But if a pitcher can change speeds, every hitter is helpless, limited by human vision.  “Except,” Maddux said, “for that [expletive] Tony Gwynn.”  Because of this inherent ineradicable flaw in hitters, Maddux’s main goal was to “make all of my pitches look like a column of milk coming toward home plate.” Every pitch should look as close to every other as possible, all part of that “column of milk.” He honed the same release point, the same look, to all his pitches, so there was less way to know its speed — like fastball 92 mph, slider 84, change-up 76.  One day I sat a dozen feet behind Maddux’s catcher as three Braves pitchers, all in a row, did their throwing sessions side-by-side. Lefty Steve Avery made his catcher’s glove explode with noise from his 95-mph fastball. His curve looked like it broke a foot-and-a-half. He was terrifying. Yet I could barely tell the difference between Greg’s pitches. Was that a slider, a changeup, a two-seam or four-seam fastball? Maddux certainly looked better than most college pitchers, but not much. Nothing was scary.  Afterward, I asked him how it went, how he felt, everything except “Is your arm okay?” He picked up the tone. With a cocked grin, like a Mad Dog whose table scrap doesn’t taste quite right, he said, “That’s all I got.”  Then he explained that I couldn’t tell his pitches apart because his goal was late quick break, not big impressive break. The bigger the break, the sooner the ball must start to swerve and the more milliseconds the hitter has to react; the later the break, the less reaction time. Deny the batter as much information — speed or type of last-instant deviation — until it is almost too late.   tl;dr   1) Studied hitters meticulously.  2) Pinpoint precision.  3) Tried meticulously to make all his pitches look the same, but with late break."

Provided that your pitches aren't easy to square up. Make them hit it into the ground or not make good contact.  Also, rarely walking guys is also very helpful to having success. Maddux lead the league in K:BB Ratio several times. Having a good strikeout rate is helpful, but it's better if you strikeout guys on occasion and also don't walk any of them."

He doesn't have the pure stuff to be a top of the rotation guy. He has plus command and control which allows his stuff to play up. You don't need dominant stuff to put up dominant numbers in the minors.   You can absolutely be ranked highly as a prospect due to a high floor. The prospect rankings aren't just upside rankings. Though Nola's ceiling isn't huge, he has a good chance of reaching it. That matters. Here's what some of the popular scouting outlets have to say about him:   Baseball America: ""Nola is like investing in Treasury bills. He’s a very safe starting pitching prospect who is big league ready."" Baseball Prospectus: ""Because we’re talking about a player who is more command than elite stuff though, it’ also reasonable to expect some turbulence in his first big league looks. He should be a fine backend starter for these final few months, with No. 2 upside if everything goes to plan."""

You didn't frame it as that you said it as if it was your opinion and you said it with some certainty.  And the scouts say a lot of stuff.  They said Dominic Brown was going to be a superstar.  They said the same thing about Delmon Young.  Scouts tend to not reverse their thinking until they are absolutely proven wrong; they said he wouldn't be much more than a mid rotation guy when he was drafted and they seem to be sticking to it despite his results.  If you look at Nola's actual numbers you see a bit of a different story, especially when compared against some other guys.  I've seen his stuff and it looks good.  He gets swing and misses, has late movement and excellent control and decent command, which I expect to progress as he gains experience.  Beyond that, he's smart about pitching, which goes a long way and is often overlooked by scouts.  He's well beyond a ""thrower"" and is on his way to being a crafty pitcher.  At this point I think Nola can be a top of the rotation starter but we'll see.  I wouldn't rule it out but I wouldn't bank on it either.  He's got just as good a chance as anyone."

We can short circuit any discussion of prospects by pointing out that scouts aren't infallible, but I don't really see the point in that.    they said he wouldn't be much more than a mid rotation guy when he was drafted and they seem to be sticking to it despite his results. If you look at Nola's actual numbers you see a bit of a different story, especially when compared against some other guys.   That's because guys with his profile (solid but unspectacular stuff, advanced pitchability) can often carve up the minors. That doesn't mean that dominance will translate to MLB. Look at Brian Johnson. He was a first round pick. He put up a 1.75 ERA in 118 IP at AA last year. He's put up 2.73 ERA in 85.2 IP at AAA this year. He has a 3.1 K/BB ratio across AA and AAA. He still projects as a mid or back of the rotation starter because his stuff caps his ceiling.   he's smart about pitching, which goes a long way and is often overlooked by scouts.   It's not overlooked. It's part of the reason he's ranked highly. It's the reason evaluators don't put a ton of stock into his minor league numbers.  I haven't said that it's inconceivable that Nola becomes a top of the rotation starter. I've only said that it's not a reasonable expectation based on what we know about him."

No stat that will talk about whether or not Avasail Garcia was sleeping with Prince Fielder's wife when he was getting divorces (Only a weird rumor when Garcia got shipped off in the dead of night).    Many quantitative folks think we will be able to solve the world's issues with econometric studies and math problems, but for some reason qualitative sciences still exist.  And thrive.

Advanced stats are useful for truly figuring out how good a player is, but traditional stats are easy on the eyes & much simpler to explain/understand."

On the other hand you have WAR that attempts to give a more holistic appreciation, yet is incredibly hard to visualize and calculate for 98% of fans. Also odd to have a stat on a -x to +15 scale.  Percentages and decimals are just so much easier to grasp and compare quickly."

BABIP tells you how often a batter got a hit on balls that were put in play. That is also telling you something that happened."

It's not particularly useful (like ERA for a single game) but you can calculate wOBA and FIP for even single game sample sizes.   wRC+ (like OPS+) scales to a league average. I guess you could take every team's performance for THAT DAY, and see who performed above or below the league average."

However, the same thing was said last year about the A's. So, either there's two coincidentally consecutive, historically exceptional years or there's some issue for which the advanced metrics fail to account.   Also, some descriptions of the advanced metrics will say that the numbers are for descriptive purposes only and not predictive purposes, which, really, I have no idea how I can use the numbers then."
baseball,3e078b,daneatdirt,5,Tue Jul 21 03:40:32 2015 UTC,WAR doesn't tell a fan anything about a specific play or specific situation during a game. Instead WAR is fun if you like to follow GM decisions.  If I'm watching a game I don't give a shit about a player's WAR.
baseball,3e078b,Threetakes,3,Tue Jul 21 01:37:34 2015 UTC,"I really like advanced stats,  but I do think they have A LOT of shortcomings.   The algorithms we use for sabermetrics are extremely subjective.  Yes,  WAR is am estimate of a player's relative value,  but various aspects are weighted heavily and others lightly based on the statistician's discretion.   (This is based on memory,  so feel free to fact check this.) Last year,  18 Jhonny Peralta had some of the highest advanced defensive stats of SS. He's a fine defender,  but he was by no means that good. It's because so many of those stats weight double plays so heavily and the Cardinals were able to induce a lot of them.  If you need other proof of their shortcomings, look at the difference between Nolan Arenado and Todd Frazier in all those advanced hitting metrics and then look at actual production."
baseball,3e078b,EnterSaint,2,Mon Jul 20 23:33:28 2015 UTC,"Peralta wasn't rated highly just for double plays. Last four years his combined UZR is +37.3, only +3.1 is from double plays. And if Arenado and Frazier part by a lot with similar slash lines it is likely due to park factors"

I’m a little bit surprised about that to be honest. The East Coast has none of the blue collar grit of the Mid West, making it my least favorite region of the country. My travels across America have generally avoided the Eastern reaches of our great country, which I find to be a detestable hive of liberal elitism, full of people who talk condescending towards you just because you’re from Kentucky and you like eating at Applebee’s. Seafood-eating, Ivy-league educated East Coast nerds are the folks who brought us deflate-gate, Kennedy over Nixon in ’60, Fort Sumter, and the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. It pains me to say this, but despite my hatred of the East Coast, I can’t help but watch what is shaping up to be a compelling division race. Here are my 2nd half predictions for the American League East:   Yeah, that guy is an idiot."

baseball,3e078b,DrAlanThicke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:17 2015 UTC,"First let me say that when used correctly there is no argument against them other than that players can change.  The past is a very poor indicator of the future because it often doesn't take into account a variable for change.  The problem with the advanced stats is how people use them to make an argument.  They'll cherry pick to make a point or they won't look at the whole picture.  There was an article by a well known Phillies blogger about Cesar Hernandez and how his current success is due to a high BABIP and that it won't last but he only looked at current BABIP.  In the comments he would answer everyones posts who agreed with him but a few people pointed out that his BABIP was in line with his career, including the minors.  He completely ignored those posts.  Not only that but Cesar had put some work/effort into changing his approach at the plate and it was very obvious by watching him when he came up and watching him now.  He wouldn't swing early, wouldn't swing at strikes that weren't something he could handle, didn't chase bad pitches, etc...  His approach was/is excellent.  This is obviously something you had to see to realize but when you did realize it and you go and look at some of the other advanced stats, besides just BABIP, like his average in certain counts as one example, it became very clear that his success was not a fluke like the author indicated and that as long as he kept up the approach he would have decent numbers.  So that's the main problem with SABR.  All of the stats are meant to be used together along with scouting to present a clear picture and help determine what's going on but most people just defer to a single number or whatever one or two stats make their case."
baseball,3e078b,TheSubversive,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a tendency to overvalue the newest stat as the new be-all-end-all and then almost abandon it when a slight tweak comes along, like ERA+ to FIP to xFIP to SIERA, add your own example. It has a bit of a hype machine aspect to it that makes me wary whenever I hear about the next great thing that's gonna explain it all.  Pitch framing is going through this now-I think I saw something on fangraphs saying it might be the most impactful aspect of the game! There's a lot of enthusiasm for new stuff we couldn't quantify before, which is good, but the overzealousness often involved makes for a backlash.  Also, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.  Telling me batting average is stupid and I should never use it makes me a lot less interested in sabrmetrics than saying, ""Is this .300 hitter as good as he's cracked up to be?  Where are the weaknesses in his game? What does he do well? What can we look at to get a better picture of what's going on?"" That's a lot more engaging, because I do care if a guy's a .300 hitter. I want to discuss whether that's important, not get lectured at why it's not."

baseball,3dymxx,djb2287,4,Mon Jul 20 21:36:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but your reasoning is fairly flawed.  First, comparing the Brewers' popularity relative to other Wisconsin sports isn't relevant to the ranking. If anything, I'd hypothesize that there is positive relationship between ""fan power ranking"" across sports by market.   Second, your anecdotal evidence in regards to attendance isn't supported by the data. The original article states that ""average attendance for 2014 as a percentage of stadium capacity"" was utilized as a variable. The Brewers were 8th in attendance and 9th this year. Not bad for the smallest market in baseball.   Of course, it's easy to pick at the methodology, as well. The study seems to put a lot of weight on social media, which may lead to a skewed demographic (as others have already stated). Ultimately, a lot more factors could have considered, but it's tough to quantify circumstantial things like influence of stadium quality, for example. Overall, though, pretty solid article IMO.   But in conclusion, numbers are just one of many tools we can use to formulate our opinions. So take it all with a grain of salt if you'd like. Go baseball!  Cheers.   EDIT: Reworded"

baseball,3dznvx,raabyraab,12,Mon Jul 20 20:49:57 2015 UTC,"Major League Baseball rule 6.05 (a)   A fielder may reach into, but not step into, a dugout to make a catch, and if he holds the ball, the catch shall be allowed. A fielder, in order to make a catch on a foul ball nearing a dugout or other out-of-play area (such as the stands), must have one or both feet on or over the playing surface (including the lip of the dugout) and neither foot on the ground inside the dugout or in any other out-of-play area. Ball is in play, unless the fielder, after making a legal catch, falls into a dugout or other out-of-play area, in which case the ball is dead.   He has to have a foot hovering over the boundary to make the catch."
baseball,3dznvx,cmays90,4,Mon Jul 20 20:59:31 2015 UTC,So would this mean someone couldn't just leap over a wall and catch a home run ball on the other side of it?
baseball,3dznvx,LibertarianSocialism,5,Mon Jul 20 21:37:59 2015 UTC,"As long as one foot is dangling above fair not-out-of-bounds territory, it's a catch and, therefore, out.   I don't think this rule is actively enforced very well, especially the end about the playing ""[falling] into a dugout or other out-of-play area"", and I'm not sure I want this rule to be enforced any differently than it currently is.  This catch is definitely legal, while this one wasn't by the rules, but was still called an out."
baseball,3dznvx,cmays90,7,Mon Jul 20 21:46:02 2015 UTC,"It's definitely debatable, but I think Donaldson's feet are still in the field of play when he catches the ball. Therefore, legal play, and called correctly."
baseball,3dznvx,cdbavg400,4,Mon Jul 20 21:56:51 2015 UTC,"Oops, I misread the rule.  I originally read it as a ""dead play, thus the out wouldn't count"" instead of ""the ball is dead, so no other runners can advance, but the catch and the out are legal"".  Good catch."
baseball,3dznvx,cmays90,5,Mon Jul 20 22:01:19 2015 UTC,"Actually if there had been runners, the catch and out would count, the ball would be dead, and the runners would be permitted to advance one base (they would need to tag up first)."

baseball,3dznvx,AlmostTheNewestDad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:16:07 2015 UTC,"Well, in the Arenado catch linked above, even though it was an amazing catch, the runner from second was able to tag up and advance to third. If Arenado had fallen into the stands, the runners should still have the opportunity to tag up and advance. Here's the rule (2015 numbering):   5.06(b)(3)(C) Each runner, other than the batter, may without liability to be put out, advance one base when a fielder, after catching a fly ball, falls into a bench or stand, or falls across ropes into a crowd when spectators are on the field.   Imagine a deep fly ball near the fence. Without the rule, you could prevent a runner from tagging up and scoring by ""falling"" over the railing after you made the catch."
baseball,3dznvx,RuleNine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:28 2015 UTC,"I understand, but it seems silly.

baseball,3dznvx,AlmostTheNewestDad,2,Tue Jul 21 14:33:36 2015 UTC,"So your issue then is with the ball becoming dead, not so much the runners advancing. I feel like they kill the ball to prevent the runners from getting more than one base, as the fielder is often not in a good position to return the ball to the infield quickly.

baseball,3dxyve,LaxMike,20,Mon Jul 20 18:21:36 2015 UTC,"Looking at these comments, I don't understand how people hate him with so much vitriol. I can understand not being a fan of his, but some people act like he's the devil because as a 22 year old his temper got the best of him during a very heated series and he did something stupid and potentially very dangerous.   While I understand his frustration at having his injured knee being thrown at during the A's game, it was definitely not the move to launch his bat into left field, but at the same time it's unbearable to listen to people who claim that he went into the game planning on taking out as many A's as possible, yet at the same time they constantly alternate between claiming he was aiming for the pitcher's mound and third base."
baseball,3dxyve,Mr_Robot_,7,Mon Jul 20 19:23:24 2015 UTC,"In his apology on MASN the next day, Manny said the knee wasn't necessarily why he got up in Donaldson's shit, that his knee was cool then. Didn't make any excuses for how he acted."
baseball,3dxyve,LaxMike,0,Mon Jul 20 19:27:08 2015 UTC,"There really isn't anything wrong with the comments in this thread, unless you mean by the O's fans who feel personally attacked when someone says the don't like him. One guy said he still doesn't like him, another two others said that they don't like him for the tantrums he threw.   However, then you have like forty angry O's fans down voting them for it. These fans are taking a weekend of his career, and judging him for it. You could call it shortsighted, and maybe even irresponsible, but they have a point. I don't think you've ever seen a player of his caliber have a weekend where he so unraveled, where he embarrassed himself again and again, and pretty clearly attempted to hit an opposing player with his BAT. You can say it was his age, whatever, but the guy was what, 21?, not 14.  I personally don't care that much, I don't give Manny Machado much thought, but you can't hold it against someone for not liking a player only a single year after he had such an embarrassing show of himself throughout an entire weekend series."
baseball,3dxyve,Intelligenttrees,7,Mon Jul 20 19:42:09 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that it's ok not to like him, and even though I personally believe there wasn't nearly as much malicious intent as you do, citing those events as evidence as to why you dislike him is completely valid.  The problem though, at least from where I'm standing, is that there always seems to be people who, since this was their first notable exposure to Machado, assume he is essentially a violent thug /prima donna. It's like the people who call Ryan Dempster a disgrace to the game because of the incident he had with A-Rod a while back. Was it a bad decision? Yeah, but it doesn't mean his reputation should be irrefutably tarnished."

baseball,3dxyve,Intelligenttrees,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:08:09 2015 UTC,"A lot of catchers have been getting hit by a lot of different batters. It's quietly one of the bigger problems the game has at the moment. Batters are trying to stand as far back in the box as possible, and catchers are trying to set themselves up as close to the plate as they can. But, when you watch the footage of Manny's back swing, it's very clear that he was trying to hit the catcher, something that in my opinion should be penalized with a lifetime ban."
baseball,3dxyve,nicholieeee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"How is it clear? It's not.  If you're referring to Manny's reaction in that particular moment, the reason he didn't turn to apologize was because he didn't think Norris would care much to hear it. So he stepped out. And when he smiled, that was at something Adam Jones said.  http://baltimoresportsreport.com/manny-machado-overreaction-52350.html   It looks like Adam Jones was talking to him the whole time and Jones is one the biggest jokesters in the clubhouse. This looks like it explains itself, unless you want to start villianizing Jones as well.   And Manny was pretty quick to apologize.

baseball,3dwfol,diestache,4,Mon Jul 20 13:13:51 2015 UTC,lol. Rain in the summer is arguably better for fires than winter rain. Summer rain makes super dry and flammable grass moist and green and less likely to burn for the rest of the fire season. Rain in the winter makes green grass thicker. In fact these rains extinguished two fires in SoCal. And it helps replenish groundwater. Stop being so ungrateful. Rain is good. period.

baseball,3dwzin,kasutori_Jack,52,Mon Jul 20 05:55:12 2015 UTC,"From the link:    Best of all, [Smoltz] retold the story of why Eddie Perez became Maddux’s personal catcher. It seems that Maddux would let the catcher know what the next pitch would be by the way he caught the catcher’s throw back to him. If he caught backed a step and caught by his gloveside shoulder, it would be a fastball up and in to the righthanded batter, and so forth.    One catcher had trouble remembering Maddux’s signs. Perez got them, and as Maddux once said, “always got the ball back to me in two seconds, so I controlled tempo.”    So yes, Perez. But it's a classic Maddux way of thinking. I guess Eddie was able to remember to pay attention on Maddux' level."
baseball,3dwzin,kasutori_Jack,28,Mon Jul 20 06:02:16 2015 UTC,"I guess Eddie was able to remember to pay attention on Maddux' level.   Cause he was Maddux's personal catcher.  They studied video, strategy, etc, together so much that it would've taken too much time for Javy to do properly and still work on his own shit (actually being good at hitting).  Maddux specifically asked for a catcher dedicated to him."
baseball,3dwzin,kasutori_Jack,20,Mon Jul 20 06:07:35 2015 UTC,"Right. But it wasn't only Perez. Remember that 1994-95, it was Charlie O'Brien who did Maddux' catching. (He was really great at framing pitches, too.) Then Javy became the starting catcher and didn't really gel with him. I'm assuming Javy is the ""one catcher who has trouble remembering,"" so then Eddie got to be Maddux' guy because he could."

He quickly became my favorite player, and then in 1993 becoming a Brave. It was just the start of his period of 1990s dominance. It was a great time to be a fan of the Braves and pitching.

Crawford and a few other secondary players sitting around high A and AA. Guys who are lesser known and probably won't be stars but look like major league regulars. The Phillies have too many holes to fill in FA so I think they'd like to have a young, low-cost core before they do any big spending.

baseball,3dy25p,ExplainsSocialEnigma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:42:10 2015 UTC,Excellent point about the incoming talent.  The point about the losses is probably untrue though. Unprofitable teams are not worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Andrus, in his age 22 and 23 seasons, hit .283/.348/.370 and was an elite base runner.  I would look at that and say I have a leadoff hitter.  Maybe the contract was too much to start with, but I can see the reasoning behind it."
baseball,3dy25p,ExplainsSocialEnigma,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:25:14 2015 UTC,One problem with that analysis is that there are plenty of managers who still use outdated lineup constructions.
baseball,3dy25p,ExplainsSocialEnigma,5,Mon Jul 20 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"Sure, but a .348 OBP is good no matter how you slice it.  Add in the great base running and you have a good leadoff hitter.  The problem, of course, is that he signed the contract and almost immediately ceased being that player."
baseball,3dy25p,very_humble,2,Mon Jul 20 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"well, we've also have to account for the fact that he plays half of his games in Arlingoton"
baseball,3dy25p,mudville9,0,Mon Jul 20 20:07:05 2015 UTC,Then why'd you show the average leadoff hitter for comparison? All that shows is that managers have been terrible at choosing leadoff hitters. Also note that great baserunning is actually more valuable further down the lineup - there's great risk and little benefit to stealing when you sluggers and walkers hit behind you.
baseball,3dy25p,L8Knight,0,Tue Jul 21 02:15:39 2015 UTC,Why'd you get even a single downvote?
baseball,3dy25p,Mazzocchi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:12:52 2015 UTC,"The contract by itself wasn't horrible, it was the construction of it. It was basically a 4/60 contact with a player option of another 4/60 at the end. If he performed well, he could opt out (while not giving up money early). If he fell off a cliff, he was guaranteed the full amount."

baseball,3dy25p,a_jackson_federalist,9,Mon Jul 20 15:00:17 2015 UTC,"Insurance will cover a significant portion of Wright's contract if he can't play, so I don't really think its quite as bad as those other dishonorable mentions."

baseball,3dy25p,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Mon Jul 20 16:01:22 2015 UTC,"Then thats an issue. But hopefully it won't come to that, hopefully Wright will play well enough if he comes back."
baseball,3dy25p,tdov,3,Mon Jul 20 16:41:46 2015 UTC,That's not particularly relevant with respect to trade value though. It's not like you trade the insurance.

baseball,3dy25p,slorebath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:51 2015 UTC,I'd argue same with Mauer. Surely the Twins aren't dumb enough to not take out an insurance policy on a long term deal for a catcher.
baseball,3dy25p,ajwhite98,0,Tue Jul 21 14:08:08 2015 UTC,"It's hard to hold injuries against anyone unless the guy had a long injury history, which Wright really didn't."
baseball,3dy25p,ExplainsSocialEnigma,3,Mon Jul 20 16:27:23 2015 UTC,"Dang, 4/5 of them are from the AL West. And this is the first one of these in a while I can remember without A-Rod and Ryan Howard."
baseball,3dy25p,parst,4,Mon Jul 20 19:29:09 2015 UTC,"You know, I'd still take Cano back anyway.  His fielding is as good as, if not better than, Drew's, and his hitting is much better, especially in NY.  Ryan sucks, and the jury's still out on Ref, so Cano would likely be a big upgrade.  And it's not like the price is much of a factor.  The only problem would be the same one that caused Cano to go to Seattle in the first place- the length of the contract.  But you don't know until you try.  How about it Mariners?"
baseball,3dy25p,ColinMichaelRisley,25,Mon Jul 20 14:54:21 2015 UTC,They didn't let Cano walk because he wasn't good. They let him walk because of the 4-5 years of the deal where he'll be shit.
baseball,3dy25p,mji6980-4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:11:53 2015 UTC,"That's what I said.   The only problem would be the same one that caused Cano to go to Seattle in the first place- the length of the contract.   Yankees don't want to give 10 year contracts to guys over 30 anymore, and I honestly can't blame them.  So Cano went to Seattle, who did give him 10 years."
baseball,3dy25p,infburz,2,Mon Jul 20 16:18:09 2015 UTC,"More specifically, they let him walk because $240M is too rich for the few years he won't be shit."
baseball,3dy25p,Cardozos,5,Mon Jul 20 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"Eh, Mariners aren't going to trade Cano.  I doubt they're delusional enough to think they're still competing this year, but the moves they made were supposed to put them in the hunt for at least a few years, and paying $100M for Cano to go somewhere else would seriously derail that plan."
baseball,3dy25p,incredibleridiculous,4,Mon Jul 20 15:21:06 2015 UTC,"I'd look on the bright side, since Martinez was hired it seems his power is coming back and he's been a lot better lately. Hopefully he's able to fix his swing mechanics and return maybe not to the caliber hitter he was with us but at least to the same sort of numbers he put up last year."
baseball,3dy25p,Theige,3,Mon Jul 20 16:25:25 2015 UTC,So basically everyone on the top 5 list will be on this one in like 10 years?

baseball,3dy25p,Theige,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:18 2015 UTC,The pirates could fix Verlander if you keep 3/4 of his contract.
baseball,3dy25p,incredibleridiculous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:09:13 2015 UTC,"I have a bit of a bone to pick with labeling older players overvalued contracts as bad.  I don't want baseball to turn into football where players complain and hold out during their first contract, their second contract, year one of a new contract, etc.  Early contracts heavily favor clubs, free agent contracts heavily favor players."
baseball,3dy25p,incredibleridiculous,3,Mon Jul 20 18:25:54 2015 UTC,Most of a football player's contract is non-guaranteed money.   That's why they hold out.
baseball,3dy25p,maltrab,0,Tue Jul 21 00:48:53 2015 UTC,"Disagree. When your salary is 800k on the last year of your rookie deal, you have seen all of the money from that.  They hold out because they think they deserve more. Probably do, but it's an annoyance."

baseball,3dv8a5,colin6,18,Sun Jul 19 20:23:05 2015 UTC,Contract up or does he have an opt-out clause? He's going to make some serious bank.
baseball,3dv8a5,Nocriz,36,Sun Jul 19 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"He can opt-out. After that, he can resign for a better contract or sign with someone else. When he signed with Dodgers 3 years ago, he did say it was because the Dodgers offer him the most money out of everyone."
baseball,3dv8a5,colin6,29,Sun Jul 19 20:57:26 2015 UTC,Dodgers will pay him the most IMO....
baseball,3dv8a5,IamVeryLost,19,Sun Jul 19 20:58:36 2015 UTC,I think that's why the Dodgers are gonna go after Hamels. A little backup insurance just in case Greinke does leave.

baseball,3dv8a5,IamVeryLost,13,Sun Jul 19 22:55:31 2015 UTC,It'd be awesome but I wonder if the front office is thinking about what happened to the Phillies with Lee and Halladay. I think they both were 35-36 when shit started to hit the fan. Greinke and Hamels are both already 31 with lots of mileage on them.
baseball,3dv8a5,TheAntagonisticDildo,9,Sun Jul 19 23:05:12 2015 UTC,"Hamels has something like 3 or 4 years left on his contact I believe.  As long as you don't re-sign him after he expires, I feel like he'll be good.   I think he can last till 35-36."

baseball,3dv8a5,AndrewNava,8,Mon Jul 20 00:16:49 2015 UTC,Opt out and he's already the third highest paid pitcher. He won't make THAT much more imo.
baseball,3dv8a5,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,18,Sun Jul 19 20:54:43 2015 UTC,He won't make that much more per season probably but she'll definitely have a longer contract and make more money in the long term which I think is what he's trying to do and is the smart thing. I also think the Dodgers will match that whatever he wants because they have the money and they're trying to win

baseball,3dv8a5,DeLuca2400,13,Sun Jul 19 20:40:58 2015 UTC,Man if only Sale and Kluber had better run support.
baseball,3dv8a5,ToastedFireBomb,54,Sun Jul 19 20:45:52 2015 UTC,"I can't agree, Kershaw is hands down the greatest pitcher in the game, and could potentially be one of the greatest of all time. Scherzer is a great pitcher, but he's not better than kersh or even king felix for that matter (overall, not specifically this year). Greinke is a top 7 pitcher at least. He may not be top 5, but he's at least top 7 in my book. Along with guys like Scherz, Kluber, Felix, and Sale."
baseball,3dv8a5,Footballvike81,23,Sun Jul 19 21:50:11 2015 UTC,"I was glad someone said something. Number wise, Max has had a better season so far. That doesn't make him a better player. Just shows his compiled numbers so far, have been a little bit better."
baseball,3dv8a5,violatedchimp,53,Sun Jul 19 21:33:11 2015 UTC,"Seriously, Kersh has one human half of a season, and suddenly the last 4 years didnt happen."
baseball,3dv8a5,ToastedFireBomb,19,Sun Jul 19 21:55:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly. In terms of this year, yeah, Scherz has Kershaw beat so far. But over the last few years in general? no way. Kershaw is consistently the best pitcher in baseball, year after year. Which is not taking anything away from Max, the guy is phenomenal. Just not as good as Kershaw."
baseball,3dv8a5,cresc,9,Sun Jul 19 22:19:32 2015 UTC,"In your opinion, who do you think is going to win the Cy Young this year?"
baseball,3dv8a5,L1eutenantDan,22,Sun Jul 19 22:33:11 2015 UTC,"Gonna be pretty tough to vote against Scherzer. Leads the league in IP, H/9/ BB/9, shutouts, FIP, and WHIP. I think if he widens that IP gap even further it'll be almost locked up. Greinke will be the best runner up in awhile though. His season is stupid good so far. If he breaks the scoreless innings streak I bet he gets a ton of support and possibly even wins it."
baseball,3dv8a5,ToastedFireBomb,45,Sun Jul 19 21:03:08 2015 UTC,"I think as it stands, Greinke has it locked. He has a 1.30 ERA. That in and of itself is already pretty amazing. With the scoreless innings streak factoring in to the decision, I think it's pretty much his to lose. Kershaw may even make a late push and end up winning it again. But it's also hard to start predicting Cy Young when there's still 2 and a half months of baseball left to play."

baseball,3dv8a5,drunk_wisconsinite,2,Sun Jul 19 23:50:18 2015 UTC,watch him get shelled for 7 runs in 4 2/3 innings pitched or something crazy because baseball.
baseball,3dv8a5,iamslm22,35,Sun Jul 19 20:35:01 2015 UTC,"This is getting real. I mean dudes is 17 innings away from the record. It was always thought of as one of those ""unbreakable"" records, but he's getting close."
baseball,3dv8a5,Cycloheptadienyl,20,Mon Jul 20 13:45:44 2015 UTC,17 innings is almost 2 complete games. 17 innings is about 30% of the current record. He isn't really even close yet.
baseball,3dv8a5,TrustMeImSingle,28,Sun Jul 19 20:22:33 2015 UTC,Or 3 games of 6 innings which seems very doable for him
baseball,3dv8a5,ttubravesrock,57,Sun Jul 19 21:28:59 2015 UTC,or one 18 inning game
baseball,3dv8a5,glowinthedark,17,Sun Jul 19 21:57:35 2015 UTC,Or half a 36 inning game.
baseball,3dv8a5,BrooklynSuperbas,16,Mon Jul 20 00:46:53 2015 UTC,Can someone please explain to me why the last out of the eighth inning against the Padres on 6/13 doesn't count? Shouldn't it be 44? I understand the stat as consecutive batters retired without giving up a run. Is that wrong?
baseball,3dv8a5,oaktreeanonymous,15,Mon Jul 20 02:25:34 2015 UTC,"Fractions aren't displaying for me which makes it confusing but this article explains. If a run was given up in an inning (as one was in the 8th against SD), it's not part of a scoreless inning.   ""For a purist, there is no such thing as a partial scoreless inning if the pitcher gives up a run in it,"" he said. ""If you want to talk about batters retired in order or how long he pitched between runs, that's different.""   http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-27/sports/sp-2843_1_record-book"
baseball,3dv8a5,FBAguy13,4,Sun Jul 19 20:22:12 2015 UTC,"I think what the are counting here is scoreless innings. Not consecutive batters retired without giving up a run. So if you pitched in the 3rd inning, that entire inning would count as 1.   So according to this logic, if you came in with 1 out in the first, and struck out 7 consecutive batters and left in the in the third with 2 outs. You would only have 1 scoreless inning."
baseball,3dv8a5,BrooklynSuperbas,2,Sun Jul 19 21:30:35 2015 UTC,But then why are they counting 43 and 2/3 instead of just 43?
baseball,3dv8a5,FBAguy13,4,Sun Jul 19 21:00:32 2015 UTC,Dunno. Seems like with orel/drysdale they rolled it though to even innings.

baseball,3dv8a5,mudville9,10,Sun Jul 19 21:23:34 2015 UTC,"What's crazy is the start before the streak started was against the Padres. He allowed two runs, one in the first inning and one in the eighth (a Justin Upton Homerun) without that HR he would be at 50.2 and one complete game + one out away from Hershiser."
baseball,3dv8a5,ihavetopoop,2,Sun Jul 19 20:26:07 2015 UTC,There's probably a hundred instances of guys who would have a longer streak if you took away an at bat.
baseball,3dv8a5,mudville9,2,Sun Jul 19 20:24:20 2015 UTC,"I doubt you could find 10 guys who, when removing one at-bat, would have a longer streak than Greinke, much less 100"
baseball,3dv8a5,Silent_R,11,Mon Jul 20 05:11:37 2015 UTC,"I would just like to say that I'm really happy to see Greinke enjoying this level of success. Going back some years, I was worried his career would get derailed by the shit he was dealing with, and that he'd never get the chance to live out his baseball life the way he should.   Should? 'Should' seems like the wrong word. The point is that I'm stoked for the dude, and I hope his success continues, and that he's able to enjoy it."

baseball,3dv8a5,SteveAM1,23,Sun Jul 19 21:44:26 2015 UTC,"Fun fact. As far as the record goes, there is no such thing as 2/3rd of a scoreless inning. Don Drysdale's record was originally 58 2/3 scoreless inning. When Hershiser was chasing it, they revised his record to 58 scoreless innings."
baseball,3dv8a5,mudville9,15,Mon Jul 20 03:13:00 2015 UTC,Why? because not finishing an inning doesn't count? but then they aren't consecutive if you have a random 2/3 stuck in the middle?
baseball,3dv8a5,SteveAM1,3,Sun Jul 19 20:29:46 2015 UTC,Not exactly sure why.  http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-27/sports/sp-2843_1_record-book
baseball,3dv8a5,oaktreeanonymous,17,Sun Jul 19 20:34:32 2015 UTC,"At least on my tablet that article isn't displaying the fractions, which makes it really confusing.   Thus, Drysdale never really pitched 58 scoreless innings in the first place. He pitched 58.  Or 58, if you agree with the rules interpretation."
baseball,3dv8a5,SteveAM1,5,Sun Jul 19 20:41:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know how they would treat that, but I guess Elias considers an inning an all or nothing affair when it comes to scorelessness. It's sort of like if you pitch 6 scoreless innings, you don't get credit for 2/3rds of a shutout on your stat sheet."
baseball,3dv8a5,mikey_mcbutt,9,Sun Jul 19 21:27:22 2015 UTC,But 2/3rds of an inning is a thing. 2 batters out.   2/3rds of a shutout is not a thing. A shutout is all or none.
baseball,3dv8a5,diamondrfk,5,Sun Jul 19 21:00:03 2015 UTC,"You're correct with the ""all-or-nothing"" guess regarding Elias's policy on scoreless streaks: a pitcher would not get credit for two-thirds of a scoreless inning if he gives up a run with two outs in that inning (which explains Drysdale's bump back to a flat 58.0).  But Greinke does get credit for his two-thirds of a scoreless inning on June 28 since he was removed mid-inning without giving up a run.  That's why his streak's currently at 43.2."

baseball,3dvla1,showhadoing,2,Mon Jul 20 05:56:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's because the hills are damn near impossible to drive on in the snow. My engine already has a hard time getting up some of those in the summer.  I wouldn't say it's about West Coast people. I would say it's a result of our geography and infrastructure that makes life a nightmare when it does snow a lot. I once worked with a guy from Chicago who said we were being ridiculous when it came to snow. I told him to try driving around out there for a few hours and then compare it to the Midwest."

So Cals just aren't used to it. And, when the skies finally open up we just aren't used to it and most aren't expecting all of that laid down oil to come to the surface.

Most places get a reasonable amount or rain to keep streets more or less clean. In areas of drought, large amounts of oil and rubber tire dust build up in the crevices of the roads. When it finally rains, all the oil and dust gets washed onto the road all at once, making them extremely slick. And for people not used to it, or driving on ice like you'd get in the Midwest, it's a giant clusterfuck."

baseball,3dvzxx,onioning,8,Mon Jul 20 21:44:30 2015 UTC,"You can't please some people.  When there's an 11-10 game, people wax poetic about how pitchers' duels are what baseball is really about, and then when there's a game where the pitchers are so dominant that neither team scores for 12 innings, they circlejerk about how awful it is."
baseball,3dvzxx,three_dee,14,Mon Jul 20 06:41:52 2015 UTC,I can assure you it was not the dominance of the pitchers that kept the Mets from scoring. They stranded something like 25 runners. That falls squarely on the terrible offense
baseball,3dvzxx,topdawg312,3,Mon Jul 20 12:12:20 2015 UTC,"Getting 25 men on is not just terrible offense. It's a mixture of good luck, bad luck, and yeah, terrible offense."
baseball,3dvzxx,slightlyaw_kward,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:25:58 2015 UTC,"It's a zero-sum game, though.  You face good pitching, and it's hard to score; and you face a depleted offense and it's easier to pitch.  They go hand in hand.  It's not all of one and none of the other.  The Cardinals are also struggling offensively, but they are still a major league team and keeping them off the board for 17 of 18 innings is a big feat."
baseball,3dvzxx,three_dee,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:43 2015 UTC,You mean the 3rd inning of the second half
baseball,3dvzxx,Whiskey_Fred,13,Mon Jul 20 07:21:03 2015 UTC,I quit after 15 or so.  This was just such an ugly game.

baseball,3dvzxx,LtDarien,2,Mon Jul 20 04:04:09 2015 UTC,"I went to the game right after that.  The Cubs had to wake up a AA player who was on the road in Round Rock, TX with the message ""Get to Houston, you're starting in the bigs in a few hours!"".  He won that game, too.

In every case, they are guys you'd probably expect to hit better going into the season.  Especially Mayberry (98 career OPS+ through 2014, 68 this season) and Nieuwenhuis (99 career OPS+ going in, 66 this season).  Other guys on the Mets' bench are pretty shitty, particularly Eric Campbell; but even Campbell shouldn't be THIS bad.  He's laboring along with a .195 BABIP.  It's been otherworldly how many balls find gloves this season."

I'm also happy that despite the game being 18 innings long, the home plate ump called a great game. There were really only 1 or 2 calls that I questioned, and those were because I'm biased.

They did a great job and were very fair in general. In particular, when Gomez and Mercer collided and Mercer was injured (a play which would have been very easy for a pissed-off fan to declare ""dirty"") the Pirates crew were very clear that they didn't believe there was any malicious intent and that it was just a clean, hard play with unfortunate results, even though it was their player that went down. I thought that was really professional when someone who was more of a homer could have easily gone off the rails calling for Gomez's head."

baseball,3e14ek,buzzKillington1,2,Tue Jul 21 03:56:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure where you got those stats, but even so a very large percentage of pitchers' plate appearances end in a successful sac bunt."
baseball,3e14ek,buzzKillington1,2,Tue Jul 21 04:00:43 2015 UTC,"2014 NL: pitchers had 526 successful sac bunts in 5141 PAs, which is 10%, which I would not call ""very large."" The 90K was all PAs.  The 50% success rate was from a Fangraphs article I can't find at the moment because their article search sucks."
baseball,3e14ek,SouthernDerpfornia,2,Tue Jul 21 04:06:42 2015 UTC,"Ok, relative to any other position it's a very large percentage of their plate appearance, also in the NL in 2014 pitchers had 5141 PAs, the next lowest position was C at 9888, nearly twice as many PAs. The effect pitchers have on league-wide OBP is largely minimized."
baseball,3e14ek,envriogis,5,Tue Jul 21 04:54:04 2015 UTC,And the #8 hitter gets IBB'd a bunch to get to the pitcher
baseball,3e14ek,SouthernDerpfornia,2,Tue Jul 21 03:54:33 2015 UTC,"This is negligible.  In 2014, the #8 batter in the NL was IBB'd 159 times, the most of any position in the batting order. Removing those 159 IBBs and assuming they resulted in all outs would lower the NL's overall OBP from .3116 to 3109. And that's assuming that ALL those IBBs would have been outs if that had not been walked."

baseball,3e14ek,thedeejus,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:12 2015 UTC,The main argument with the DH is two people only playing half of the game. And OBP isnt the best stat to use for comparison.

Some of those teams have a better shot at their division than either of the WCs."

baseball,3dyrbi,KeyzerSozee,8,Tue Jul 21 01:46:48 2015 UTC,"I think you also have to look at how many teams you're behind, in addition to how many games back. For instance, the White Sox are only 7 games back of a Wild Card spot, but they're behind the Twins, Astros, Orioles, Rays, Blue Jays, Tigers, Indians, and Rangers. Could they theoretically catch up with some of these teams? Sure. All of them? Highly unlikely. If you're 5+ back of a wildcard spot and you're trailing 5+ teams, you probably want to sell or stand pat.  This is personally how I see all MLB teams at this trading deadline:  Buyers   Yankees Blue Jays Orioles Rays Royals Twins Tigers Indians Angels Astros Mets Nats Cardinals Pirates Cubs Dogers Giants   Sellers    Red Sox White Sox Rangers A's Mariners Braves Marlins Phillies Reds Brewers Padres Rockies Diamondbacks"
baseball,3dyrbi,Constant_Gardner11,4,Mon Jul 20 17:14:14 2015 UTC,"I think that sellers list is even shorter- I mean its unlikely the Rockies will have a total fire sale, same with the White Sox, Marlins, and Reds. Just because the team sucks doesn't mean they will sell necessarily. The Phillies could go either way (either nothing or sell) so this list then becomes (In a sellers market, of course). I'm not really speculating on the teams, just the players offered.    Sellers  A's: Tyler Clippard (RP), Ben Zobrist (everywhere), Scott Kazmir (SP), Josh Reddick (OF)  Braves: Kelly Johnson (OF), Jim Johnson (RP), Chris Johnson (IF)  Brewers: Gerardo Parra (OF), Aramis Ramerez (IF), Carlos Gomez (OF), Francisco Rodriguez (RP)  Padres: Justin Upton (OF), Craig Kimbrell (RP)  Diamondbacks: er... um....  Reds (if Walt wakes up): Cueto (SP), Bruce (1B/OF), Chapman (RP), Mike Leake (SP)  Phillies?: Pappelbon (RP), Hammels (SP),   Red Sox: Mike Napoli (1B)  The Rangers could get Hammels or just stand pat at the deadline.

baseball,3dyrbi,Vecusum,2,Mon Jul 20 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"Of the teams that are 10 down the 3 that I'd say could probably come back from it are the Mariners, the A's, and the Tigers. All three teams have a lot of things going for them and only a few holes.  The Mariners have the closer they need in the organization, if they can move on some more consistent hitters they should be a much better team, they've definitely got the tools to try for, at least, a wildcard spot.  The A's need help in the bullpen, that's really it, not even a lot of help with Scribner pitching better and Pomeranz who can fill the long-man role. They need a consistent set up man or a closer and there's a few out there on the block. That being said, since it's Beane, my money is on them somehow picking up someone like Capps and some starters (maybe from Toronto in trade for Clippard?). Beane seems to have a weakness for starting pitchers.  The Tigers need a starter. Well, really they need an ace. The Tigers are a team that seems to need to always have 2 great pitchers, another good pitcher, and at least 2 power bats. When they're missing any one of those they slide. Right now they're getting performances from the bats in Miggy's absence but Verlander is really hurting them. It's made worse by Green and Simon being inconsistent (certainly more than Porcello ever was for them). Basically they need to be able to consistently expect 7 innings from 3 starters and keep the homers coming to pad that run differential since there's something in their bullpen water that just makes good relievers bad. Now they they actually have a closer (Soria) that doesn't blow every other save or so (Nathan) they could really take advantage of picking up Cueto, Hamels, or really even an above average 2nd/3rd starter that can go deep in games (like say Dickey or Colon).  Of the teams above it the Braves, Rangers, and Astros seem likely, to mo, to be sellers.  The Rangers must know they're just not consistent enough for that division right now. Next season they've got a lot of potential, when they finally have a healthy rotation. Right now though they've definitely got a few people they could probably sell high on and then try and make up for losing on the free market. Tolleson comes to mind.  The Braves are already signalling that they're sellers. It's actually pretty impressive that they're only something like 5 games under .500 and they've got some talent worth selling that can help them be competitive in the next few seasons. The Mets and Nats have ridiculous pitching right now and I don't see how they could compete with the Nats this season between their lack of pitching depth and the Nat's bats.  The Astro's are probably the strangest on this list. They're here because no one expected them to be here, they're clearly falling back, they have some clear huge holes, for example; they can hit hard but seems to struggle to hit everything else. The A's and Mariners seem to have fewer critical issues than the Astro's and the Astro's are in a great position to sell high on some, likely, overvalued sluggers that can help them continue their franchise plan of building for the coming generation.  Aside from that you have the expected, likely the Phillies and White Sox finally unloading players. The Padres are a wild card. I'd guess the Reds and Brewers will probably look for some minor leaguers."
baseball,3dyrbi,OptionK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:29:23 2015 UTC,"I was just wondering yesterday: has anyone compiled all the data to determine when a team in a given position has a 95% or higher likelihood of making or not making the playoffs? It feels like it would be pretty easy to use all of the past seasons to identify a point at which teams have been up X games up with Y games left and gone on to make the playoffs 95% of the time or more (and then the converse for bad teams not making the playoffs). Wouldn't this be a reasonable point at which to count a team in or out?  Of course if that point doesn't come along until game #160 or something, maybe it doesn't do you any good. Maybe then a lower number (90%? 75%?) would be more reasonable to use.  And then, could you use this data to make bets on what teams will/won't make the playoffs? Is it even possible to make such bets so late in a season?"

baseball,3dwdun,jumpstartation,5,Mon Jul 20 02:29:00 2015 UTC,It seemed to catch the camera guy by surprise! From my one viewing it seemed to me  like they threw to third to get the guy from first and then an error was made somewhere there as well.
baseball,3dwdun,mikkednb,17,Mon Jul 20 02:32:31 2015 UTC,"The video doesn't do a great job of showing it, but I was there and saw it happen:   Pick-off attempt goes over the first baseman's head.   Runner on second makes it all the way in to home unchallenged.   The runner that started on first is rounding second when the first baseman recovers and picks up the ball. He throws it to third base, but that throw also goes over the infielder's head. The runner keeps going and rounds third.   Third baseman recovers the ball and throws it home. Runner slides in and the catcher loses the ball. Runner is called safe.  He probably would've been out if the catcher had maintained it. It was a pretty wonky ending, but hey, I'll take it. Reminded me of my early days where kids were chasing each other on the basepaths, throwing around the field."

He's the winning run and they had the opportunity to lead that inning off with anybody: so they chose the light-hitting shortstop so he could sacrifice?

baseball,3e081r,random_user_1,8,Mon Jul 20 23:18:51 2015 UTC,"A few possible reasons. MLB doesn't want to sell advertising in those slots because the added bandwidth used for pushing the video through might be too expensive, at least until more people sign up and watch through MLB.TV   It could also be that advertisers aren't willing to pay because the number of eye/years watching through MLB.TV isn't large enough to be cost effective yet.  Furthermore advertisers might not want to use it because the blackouts make it more difficult to have region specific advertising.    Those are some possibilities. It could be any number of things though."
baseball,3e081r,Limond,3,Mon Jul 20 23:31:23 2015 UTC,I hadn't thought about the bandwidth issue. Does broadcasting dead air use the same amount as content? Is broadcasting broadcasting?
baseball,3e081r,Limond,4,Mon Jul 20 23:34:40 2015 UTC,There is a base level that it will always cost to push something out over the internet. However because everything is digital now it is a lot simpler to compress what you want to send out. Compression results in less information being sent out and with less information you have lessened power requirements.
baseball,3e081r,Limond,3,Mon Jul 20 23:42:13 2015 UTC,If you are talking about broadcasting over the air and being picked up by an antenna there will be a HUGE difference power wise from broadcasting no signal to a full signal.
baseball,3e081r,necropaw,6,Mon Jul 20 23:46:02 2015 UTC,"That's odd.  Mlb.tv always has a 'commercial break in progress' screen, but the radio feed has the commercials,  unless it's changed recently."
baseball,3e081r,Antithesys,4,Mon Jul 20 23:45:59 2015 UTC,"Are you talking specifically about radio? Because I'm pretty sure I do get local commercials for radio. I certainly get them for Twins broadcasts and I'm pretty sure the last time I listened to an out-of-market radio stream (the Nats during Scherzer's perfect game attempt) I got DC commercials too. The only thing that seems blacked out is the station identification, that's always dead air.  The TV streams don't have ads, nor do they have the ""let's check in with the studio"" segments, but I dunno why anyone would want to watch TV ads, so this is actually a major plus for me."
baseball,3e081r,gogiants48,2,Mon Jul 20 23:47:22 2015 UTC,I'm talking about radio specifically. I get some commercials but I also get dead air or MLB.tv specific audio. Classic moments of baseball and such. Sometimes dead air.
baseball,3e081r,LtDarien,3,Mon Jul 20 23:49:24 2015 UTC,"Some radio feeds have ads, some don't. The Giants have adds, but the Rockies didn't last year. My guess is that it might have something to do with the contracts between the individual clubs and their advertisers."

Then went on to win the World Series.  I still hate Shane Victorino...that damn grand slam in game 2. Off of Sabathia too. Dude isn't a power guy and he hits a bomb off our ace.  But that's baseball and that's probably why I love it so much.

baseball,3dy7uq,eatemuptigs,4,Mon Jul 20 22:54:28 2015 UTC,Lots of really good set up guys.  They typically end up being closers.   The Mets have 2 really good set up guys in Bobby Parnell and Jenrry Mejia who used to be successful closers for the Mets who only lost their jobs due to injury and then Jeurys Familia (who was the setup guy for Mejia last year) had been almost perfect this year so he's the closer now.   Also Dellin Betances isn't the Yankees closer but everyone is aware of his abilities.   In 2002 the Angels had K-Rod and Brendan Donnelly as set up men.   At one point Brad Lidge was Billy Wagner's setup man...   It happens alot.

His FIP is over twice his ERA (3.41 vs 1.58).  On Fangraphs his soft, medium, and hard hit ball percentages are all almost exactly in line with his career norms.  To his credit, he has stopped walking guys.  Not much else has changed.  I would be very, very hesitant to trust him past the 7th.  He's an average reliever and he's probably going to start pitching like it soon."

Ultimately I think he made a better career move because its a tough job becoming an elite starter and it comes with more injury possibilities for someone like him.
baseball,3dvh0z,FrostyD7,6,Sun Jul 19 23:03:55 2015 UTC,I would say that throwing 100+ consistently and always being max effort is a bigger injury scenario than starting.
baseball,3dvh0z,Rainbow_Llama,12,Mon Jul 20 02:55:15 2015 UTC,"You're right, but going all out at 100+ MPH for one inning at a time is less damaging than over seven innings. Even if you do the former four times a week, it's still fewer IP over a season."
baseball,3dvh0z,SharksFanAbroad,-2,Mon Jul 20 06:20:44 2015 UTC,IP doesn't matter so much when you consider that going 100% puts a lot more stress on the arm than dialing it back like a starter does.
baseball,3dvh0z,Rainbow_Llama,2,Mon Jul 20 10:17:38 2015 UTC,You could flip it around and say effort level doesn't matter so much when you consider that going 6-8 innings a game puts a lot more stress on the arm than pitching 1 inning like a reliever does.  Effort and length of outing both matter. It would be ignorant to say only one of them does.
baseball,3dvh0z,reallydumb4real,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't say only one does. When you're talking about pushing ligaments to their limits though you cannot definitely say that 6-8 innings puts more stress on the arm than 1 inning of work like you are proclaiming is a fact. Studies show that with various movements of the body, the max effort movements will almost always produce more injury than less explosive and more endurance movements."
baseball,3dvh0z,Rainbow_Llama,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:26:52 2015 UTC,"It be highly unlikely that he wound throw 100+ consistently and go max effort all the time as a starter. Most starters dial it back a tad for control and to save their arm. Gerrit Cole is a pretty good recently example of this. He can throw 99-100 mph, and he will occasionally if he's really hyped up for whatever reason during a game, but he usually keeps it around 95-96 for most of a start.   It's pretty common for starters who go to the bullpen to have an increase in their velocity, and vice versa for relievers who become starters."
baseball,3dvh0z,Lacer_Lis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:52:06 2015 UTC,It be highly unlikely that he wound throw 100+ consistently and go max effort all the time as a starter.   That was my point. Max effort as a reliever vs. being a starter might have different levels of stress.
baseball,3dvh0z,Rainbow_Llama,0,Mon Jul 20 10:16:31 2015 UTC,"Sure, but being a max effort reliever doesn't lead to more stress or make a player more injury prone. How often do you hear of a reliever getting injured? The starter to reliever ratio in terms of injuries leans very heavily towards starters. And the relievers who do get Tommy John, usually were starters at some point in their career for more than just a year in high school."
baseball,3dvh0z,Lacer_Lis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:05:45 2015 UTC,"Max effort actually does lead to being more injury prone, relievers get injured a lot lol where have you been?"
baseball,3dvh0z,Rainbow_Llama,-36,Mon Jul 20 19:29:03 2015 UTC,He was a starter in Cuba and in the minors after he was first signed. The Reds would be fucking insane to not try him out in this lost season.
baseball,3dvh0z,MundaneInternetGuy,35,Sun Jul 19 22:48:27 2015 UTC,"The Reds would be fucking insane to not try him out in this lost season.   This isn't OOTP, you don't just convert a guy from dominant closer to a starter mid-season"

baseball,3dvh0z,danbrochill17,4,Mon Jul 20 14:38:42 2015 UTC,In fact I am not sure I can think of anyone who went from good closer to good starter.  Smoltz was good at both but only after being a starter for a while.  Derek Lowe actually but he might be the only one.
baseball,3dvh0z,thedeejus,5,Mon Jul 20 10:12:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely C.J. Wilson. Kind of Ryan Dempster, but he went from bad starter to bad closer to decent starter."
baseball,3dvh0z,AsDevilsRun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:30:24 2015 UTC,Wilson was never good and a fulltime closer in the same season
baseball,3dvh0z,thedeejus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:20:58 2015 UTC,Pretty arbitrary distinction. He was the Rangers' saves leader from 2007-2009 and was good outside of when he tried to pitch through elbow problems that ended up shutting him down in 2008. He was absolutely our closer.
baseball,3dvh0z,AsDevilsRun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:52:20 2015 UTC,"Well, in 2007 he only had 12 saves and Eric Gagne had 16, so CJ wasn't closer for a full season.  In 2008 CJ was the closer, but his ERA was over 6.  Then in 2009 he only has 14 saves and Frankie Francisco has 25 again.  Point being, at no point was he a) ""the closer"" for a full season and b) good"
baseball,3dvh0z,thedeejus,2,Mon Jul 20 12:59:14 2015 UTC,"I know what happened. I watched him. He was a good closer. Just because he doesn't meet your fairly arbitrary distinction doesn't mean it's not true.  He had roughly 60 save opportunities over a span of about 90 appearances, during which he was (on average) good. That's fairly typical of a closer. The fact that an injury and some trades makes them bracketed by lots of non-closer time doesn't mean he wasn't a closer over that span."
baseball,3dvh0z,AsDevilsRun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:05:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if/why it's necessary to differentiate closers from other relievers?   Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija both converted from relievers to starters though. Samardzija was neither good as a reliever it a closer if that matters though. Sale was a good reliever but only 12 saves, not really a closer I imagine only used when the ""official"" closer had already gone back to back days.   Actually if I recall there was a lot of discussion the same offseason about converting both Sale and Chapman but only the White Sox went through with it."
baseball,3dvh0z,NamingThingsSucks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:07 2015 UTC,well most pitchers come up and start out as relievers before moving into the rotation.  Being made closer is an honorific rarely given to rookies.
baseball,3dvh0z,thedeejus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:43 2015 UTC,"Some starters are used as relievers ahead of time in September call ups but that wasn't really the case with Sale or Samardzija. They were both used as relief pitchers for years before they began starting.   Maybe White Sox fans remember better, it seems odd to me if they wanted Chris Sale as a starter from the beginning that he would be used as nothing but a reliever in minors/majors for 2 years. Even if they had a fantastic starting rotation you typically would expect him to be in the minors as a starter until September, teams typically won't use future starting pitchers for years as a reliever instead of just leaving them in the minors.   With Samardzija it seems to be (based off my recollection and stats). They wanted him as a starter, they tried him in the minors and 2008 and 2009 were September call ups. Then I remember them giving up, and he was shifted to a reliever in 2010 and 2011. They used him all of both years including half of his time in the minors as a reliever. They definitely always wanted him to be a starter but my recollection was they gave up and tried him as a reliever to get something out of him, and then switched him back to a starter after he found success. When someone's first 150 innings in the majors are as a reliever it's tough for me to not see him as starting out as a reliever.   Chapman was at pretty much the same place as Sale at the end of 2011 when I first heard talk of converting him to start. If the Reds had swapped him then it could also have looked like they never considered him as a reliever."
baseball,3dvh0z,NamingThingsSucks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:24 2015 UTC,"Price was used as a reliever and closer at the end of the season going into the playoffs and was pretty good, then a starter the next season."

baseball,3dyyim,ManceRaider,7,Mon Jul 20 18:08:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. In terms of pure run prevention, Greinke has been better than Scherzer.

baseball,3dyyim,lankyskanky,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:26:19 2015 UTC,Kershaw had a pretty awful start to the season for Kershaw standards. hence his 2.68 ERA and 7-6 record.  Hard to argue that he has had a better year than Greinke who is sitting at 1.30 and 9-2.
baseball,3dyyim,SultanofStella,10,Mon Jul 20 18:06:23 2015 UTC,ERA and W-L are horrible metrics to use to evaluate pitchers.
baseball,3dyyim,DrAlanThicke,11,Mon Jul 20 18:56:04 2015 UTC,Era is hardly a horrible metric.
baseball,3dyyim,SultanofStella,2,Mon Jul 20 22:03:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't understand that comment at all, unless by horrible he means reputable."
baseball,3dyyim,Youreprobablygay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:43:10 2015 UTC,"Era isn't perfect though. Having a good defense behind you vs. a bad defense can mean a 1 run difference in your era. The argument is a team dependent stat shouldn't be the defining stat of one player. Off the top of my head, scherzer has allowed a couple ""earned runs"" after Desmond has failed to turn what could be inning ending double plays, without committing an error."
baseball,3dyyim,WellonDowd,4,Tue Jul 21 14:38:42 2015 UTC,Isn't the objective of the pitcher to not allow runs? I'd say ERA is a fine metric.

baseball,3dyyim,djb2287,14,Tue Jul 21 03:46:31 2015 UTC,What definition of Modern Era are you using? Bob Gibson had a 1.12 ERA in 1968.
baseball,3dyyim,WellonDowd,9,Mon Jul 20 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"haha, ESPN defines the line at 1969. Link"
baseball,3dyyim,envriogis,22,Mon Jul 20 18:28:49 2015 UTC,They use 1969 because that is when the MLB lowered the mound.
baseball,3dyyim,ManceRaider,4,Mon Jul 20 18:44:20 2015 UTC,This is the only correct answer.
baseball,3dyyim,A_few_prawns_short,10,Mon Jul 20 20:17:50 2015 UTC,Huh. I've never heard Modern Era used that way. Usually baseball is divided up thus:  Modern Era: 1901 and later  Dead Ball Era: 1919 and before  Live Ball Era: 1920 and later  Divisional era: 1969 and later  Wild Card era: 1994 and later
baseball,3dyyim,A_few_prawns_short,6,Mon Jul 20 18:39:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say replace ""divisional era"" with ""Expansion era"" 1961 and later. Otherwise, pretty spot on."
baseball,3dyyim,Nanny_McPhee,5,Mon Jul 20 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"I prefer '69 because it was a drastically different year from '68 - moreso than the jump from '60 to '61. Four expansion teams were added in 1969, the mound was lowered, teams were split up into divisions, and it was the first year of playoff expansion (ALCS/NLCS). The difference between 1960 and 1961 is that the AL added two teams."
baseball,3dyyim,Swaneaven,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:27 2015 UTC,No need to replace. Most of them overlap as it is.
baseball,3dyyim,bricktamland48,3,Tue Jul 21 02:57:33 2015 UTC,"That's just a misinformed article by an ESPN writer. ESPN does not define the Modern Era as 1969 on.  Edit: the article even admits that the official Modern Era begins far earlier, though it claims that it arbitrarily begins in 1900 rather than in 1901 for a variety of valid reasons, hence the misinformation."

baseball,3dyyim,JV19,12,Mon Jul 20 18:14:52 2015 UTC,He probably assumes that any power-hitting first baseman is automatically a bad fielder. Which is obviously not true.
baseball,3dyyim,WholeLottaGlove,7,Mon Jul 20 19:26:11 2015 UTC,"As of right this second. Harper. If the Greinke continues his season then he could be in talks. If Harper (hopefully doesn't happen) gets injured, I think Greinke has a good shot"
baseball,3dyyim,lankyskanky,6,Mon Jul 20 18:06:55 2015 UTC,"Harper easily, but if the Nat somehow miss the playoffs (and assuming the D'backs do too), I could consider Greinke. I don't think Greinke has much of a chance to win, because I'm not even sure he's the best pitcher on his team by the end of the season."

baseball,3dyyim,Senor_Meth,3,Mon Jul 20 21:55:10 2015 UTC,I mean Goldy is having an MVP caliber season but Harper is on a whole other level. He is putting up numbers we haven't seen since bonds
baseball,3dyyim,Genetalia69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:58:29 2015 UTC,"... Why? Comparable player profiles this year except Harper's hitting for better power and is overall significantly more productive on offense. If it's a playing time thing, I personally am not convinced that the extra games Goldy's played outweigh Harper's superior output."
baseball,3dyyim,MilvilleMeteorologis,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"I would be happy with either Harper or Greinke, but am expecting Harper to get it. People like day-to-day players and offense more."
baseball,3dzt7k,Rogueofoz,9,Mon Jul 20 21:27:14 2015 UTC,"Although r/baseball has generally agreed on fWAR, there's still rWAR and WARP which claim to have a better estimate. Nobody can dispute a player's batting average but you can bring up a different model of WAR to dispute a player's value.  As mentioned, WAR is an estimate and it is constantly being adjusted. For instance this year Fangraphs added GIDP into fWAR and applied it retroactively. Two years ago Fangraphs and Baseball Reference agreed on a standard value for replacement players, and adjusted WAR accordingly. That means the WAR estimate you cite this year may very well be different the following season.  Nobody agrees on how to measure defense. Fangraphs themselves tells you that a single season of defensive data is insufficient to determine a player's ability, and suggests using a three year average.    EDIT : Accidentally hit submit before I was done. It's good that WAR is adjusted so often. These adjustments are improvements and they need to be made. But telling your average fan that a number calculated by people they've never heard of which always changes is superior to numbers that don't change that they can witness in game is a losing battle."
baseball,3dzt7k,boilface,5,Mon Jul 20 22:19:39 2015 UTC,WAR isn't consistent enough for public use. Just about every website calculates it differently and it's not precise to begin with.

baseball,3dzt7k,parst,4,Mon Jul 20 22:19:33 2015 UTC,Where's the lack of understanding come in? We have a full understanding of WAR both conceptually and mechanically. That it falls short of perfectly describing reality (and always will) doesn't mean we fail to understand it.

baseball,3dzt7k,parst,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:47 2015 UTC,It's important to not use just one stat to tell about a player. It's when you look at all of them that you really gauge a player's worth. Low ERA but a shit load of walks/hits given up? The pitcher is probably lucky.   High RBI and K total but low average and no walks? The batter probably benefits from a good lineup.

At the end of the day baseball is an amusement business, and unless you enjoy the notion of 'being there even in the bad days', there was no enjoyment to be had at most of the games in the last 4-5 seasons.

Especially with a payroll like Detroit.  However Price seems like he is going to go to the highest bidder in the off season, so I say sell him off then pay him. Because without him their rotation is an absolute mess. Their offense is honestly fine so I guess look for an upgrade for OF or 3B in the off season, but they need to spend for pitching.

baseball,3dvbon,aggieinoz,14,Sun Jul 19 22:38:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly you guys don't even need a big rebuild, just a reload. You've got the payroll to get good free agents when you're ready to contend again, and a solid core with Cabrera, Iglesias and Jd Martinez. You don't have to do it like a small market team and build through the draft, you guys can sign solid players when you need them."
baseball,3dvbon,ShakeItTilItPees,9,Sun Jul 19 22:46:55 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I feel. Our position players will be set entering next year, barring probably one outfield spot. We have around $60 million coming off the payroll this year, and the pitching free agent class will be deep. We can compete again next year, and getting some more youth in return for Price, Cespedes and Soria is going to help that."

baseball,3e0xhq,Jam_with_me,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:49 2015 UTC,Red Sox pitcher*  Good scouting picks up patterns. Part of good pitching is disguising your pitches. You want each pitch to look nearly identical from wind up to delivery. Rodriguez looks down at his glove when he throws off speed and everybody knows now.

baseball,3e0xhq,rbhindepmo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:29 2015 UTC,Rodriguez throws 3 pitches and 2/3rds of his pitches are fastballs. That fastball percentage is around 75-80% for first pitches.  I can see how they might pick up on a pattern there.

Greinke knows where the umpire was setting the strike zone and stretching it as much as he could.  You could definitely tell the Nationals were getting heated but batting on tilt which is not going to help them get on base.

All of the Nats batters were frustrated, and you could see it getting worse each time the lineup turned around.  That's gonna happen when starting pitchers hold you to 0R 6H and 25K in back to back days.  Harper just let his frustration get the best of him.  I don't know if we'll ever see him stop letting his anger show on the field - that's just the kind of player he is.

baseball,3dx3x7,Iliketrainschoo_choo,-10,Mon Jul 20 14:20:28 2015 UTC,Did you see the two K's? The first AB had 2 questionable calls and the second literally didn't have a strike thrown. Just pathetic umpiring.
baseball,3dx3x7,thekyle1591,7,Mon Jul 20 15:29:26 2015 UTC,"Like I said in another post, pitchf/x showed just one missed call on Harper all day. That was strike one in his 7th inning AB.   The first AB had 2 questionable calls...   There was only one called strike in that AB, and it was in the zone  Here is the one bad call in his second strikeout."
baseball,3dx3x7,dukiehazzard,-13,Mon Jul 20 18:16:07 2015 UTC,"Umpires typically don't give both corners and even slightly outside the corners, so you can see why Harper was frustrated. Especially when he is the most selective hitter in baseball, you typically don't see the borderline calls, especially away to left handlers, go against him. Which happened all day."

In actuality, Joe Kelly kinda sucks.  He throws hard but doesn't get the strikeouts to match, and he walks too many people. His secondary pitches are second-rate for a starter, and his command of them is not good (contributing to his inability to put people away). He's had a 4.00+ FIP every year of his career, and gives up a ton of homers.  He's fun, sure. But he's an okay reliever at best. He's not good."

Either way it seems like kind of an FU from Lackey that he'd play league minimum for others but not the Sox. I actually don't think it was a bad trade either, it just didn't work out for Boston.

baseball,3du2s4,kuhanluke,2,Sun Jul 19 18:44:59 2015 UTC,It was pretty commonly known around here that he wasn't that happy here and that there was pretty much no way he was going to play for the $500k.

""commonly known"" to me sounds like the local sports media kept saying it could happen enough times that people decided that it would happen. But this article doesn't really make it seem like Lackey was planning to welch on his contract and he'd just come off a World Series win with the Sox so I don't know why he'd be upset. Cherington didn't seem to want to get into details about it. If Lackey was upset, it was probably because the Boston sports media and fans were getting pissed at him for threatening to retire despite the fact that he never threatened to retire."
baseball,3du2s4,kuhanluke,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:59:18 2015 UTC,"he'd just come off a World Series win with the Sox so I don't know why he'd be upset   He was playing on a last place team that was about to trade their best pitcher away.  I don't think there are too many guys who would want to play for the league minimum after a season like that, especially with how well he was pitching.     If Lackey was upset, it was probably because the Boston sports media and fans were getting pissed at him for threatening to retire despite the fact that he never threatened to retire.   He was tired of dealing with the fans and media.  Yes, the team had an unbelievable year in 2013, but he was constantly being chewed out by fans and the media for his performance prior to that after he signed with the team.  He was hammered by the fans and media after the 2011 season despite the fact that it came out later that he really shouldn't have been pitching because he was pitching hurt.  On top of that, he was crushed by both for the whole chicken and beer thing too.  It seemed like he had enough of pitching here, got his redemption and title, and just wanted to get out to a place where he wouldn't be harassed.    No, Lackey never came out and said he wouldn't pitch here for the league minimum and yes, I'm going off of a lot of speculation, but, in my opinion, most of it is speculation with a strong foundation."
baseball,3du2s4,Claypool2112,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:23:51 2015 UTC,"Lackey said he wouldn't play for league minimum, so the Sox either had to trade him, renegotiate, or let him retire.  That said, the trade could've been great if Craig and Kelly played like their 2013 selves. It could still turn out well if they can bounce back. Craig hasn't found his power, but he's hitting the ball and drawing walks down in AAA.  His contract is ridiculous, but he could find a role yet on the Sox. Kelly is likely coming back to the Red Sox as a reliever, and with his stuff he could really excel in the late innings. What's really going to bite us in the ass is trading Cespedes and signing Sandoval."
baseball,3du2s4,Dwayne_J_Murderden,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:33:03 2015 UTC,"I wish people would do some research before talking about this. Lackey stated that he probably wouldnt play for the minimum for the Red Sox. So they traded him. Sure the return was a little low, but I'd rather have two players who are playing baseball than one who would rather retire than play out a clause that he agreed to in his contract."

baseball,3du2s4,youreaturtle,186,Sun Jul 19 17:46:26 2015 UTC,"Another interesting note, though:  Currently:  Brewers - 17th in runs scored  Pirates - 19th in runs scored  Cubs - 23rd in runs scored  Reds - tied with Cubs at 23rd in runs scored  Every NL Central team is below average at scoring runs.  So either offenses in the NL Central suck or having pitchers like Arrieta, Lester, Cole, Cueto, and the above mentioned Cardinals are just too much for the offenses."
baseball,3du2s4,Maverick814,82,Sun Jul 19 14:35:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit of both, honestly. The starting pitchers shut down the offense, and then the bullpen comes in to pitch a couple innings against a gassed and discouraged (and in many cases, young) offense."
baseball,3du2s4,jercubsfan,-73,Sun Jul 19 15:38:38 2015 UTC,why would the offense be gassed in the NL central? are you thinking bc of the weather or that it's so much more tiring to face NL central starters for some reason?   I completely disagree with you  the people downvoting this and upvoting the comment above and below do not understand the physical aspect of baseball and the fact my comment is so negative and one above is so positive shows how poor the baseball knowledge is in this sub. this sub is incredibly ill-informed on what goes on in baseball games if it really thinks players get exhausted from going 0-for-2
baseball,3du2s4,flipadelphiaisback,39,Sun Jul 19 16:55:43 2015 UTC,They're gassed because after getting shut out the whole game you're not exactly at the top of your game come 7-8-9th inning and you need to score right away.
baseball,3du2s4,thebansarereal,17,Sun Jul 19 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"Precisely. Plus, in the case of the Cubs especially, the majority of the players are young and their endurance isn't quite where it's supposed to be. It's a long, hot season."
baseball,3du2s4,jercubsfan,-29,Sun Jul 19 17:25:59 2015 UTC,You can't really believe this can you? That young players fatigue by the 7th inning due to a lack of endurance? And they tire quicker if they aren't scoring runs. You obviously don't play baseball or know mich about players but please tell me the thought process so I can correct it
baseball,3du2s4,flipadelphiaisback,15,Sun Jul 19 17:34:25 2015 UTC,"It is very demoralizing to get shut down every time you come to the plate, or shut down every time you get close to scoring and fail.  You try and try and try to no success, it gets mentally tiring and as a result physically tiring.  Granted I'm not in great shape or a professional athlete, but playing rec league softball, we'd have tons and tons of energy as a team during games where we were running all over our opponents, and next to none if we were being routed.  It's a mental thing every bit as much as a physical thing.  The young guys will be much more susceptible to that type of fatigue than the veterans.  If you've got an entire team of rookies, there's little leadership to bring you up when you're down like that."
baseball,3du2s4,zigmus64,4,Sun Jul 19 17:44:22 2015 UTC,I think it's more of a mental fatigue rather than a physical one.
baseball,3du2s4,Calipup,-21,Sun Jul 19 18:58:08 2015 UTC,This makes absolutely no sense. Why would being shut out tire you out? I can't even follow the thought process that leads you to that conclusion. It's completely wrong
baseball,3du2s4,flipadelphiaisback,7,Sun Jul 19 17:32:16 2015 UTC,Its mentally exhausting. Have you ever played sports?
baseball,3du2s4,ModernPoultry,-5,Sun Jul 19 20:35:30 2015 UTC,Yes I have played baseball at a very high level and that's helps me know this explanation is complete nonsense. Baseball players do not get exhausted mentally from going 0-2
baseball,3du2s4,flipadelphiaisback,2,Sun Jul 19 22:18:50 2015 UTC,"A player doesn't get mentally exhausted from going 0-2, but players will get mentally exhausted/demoralized/discouraged when the team starts the game going 2-18 with 7 or 8 strikeouts. You get the feeling that there's nothing you can do as long as that pitcher is in."
baseball,3du2s4,jmr33090,0,Mon Jul 20 15:49:38 2015 UTC,"no they won't someone else's at-bats results do not effect your fatigue. and anyway the entire point was that the batters will be too exhausted to hit relievers after facing a good starter, which is just nonsense.  I cannot believe this subreddits total lack of knowledge"
baseball,3du2s4,flipadelphiaisback,2,Mon Jul 20 16:01:41 2015 UTC,"It's discouraging. And being discouraged emotionally is bad for hitting form as hitters start pressing and trying to do too much. On top of that, all the stress of that can physically tire you out. Thus they end up being worse."

baseball,3du2s4,Jrodkin,8,Sun Jul 19 15:26:23 2015 UTC,"Everyone needs Shelby Miller. The Cards only have four strong starters at the moment. Garcia could come back strong. Martinez and Wacha have IP limits. Lance Lynn has something wrong with his arm that he is pitching through and throwing almost only fastballs.  The rotation is still in great shape, but it's not like they're in a spot like the Nats or Mets with lightly used high-end talent waiting around."
baseball,3du2s4,JohnnyWaffleseed,5,Sun Jul 19 15:55:36 2015 UTC,only have four strong starters   not like they're... the Mets... lightly-used   what   Martinez and Wacha have IP limits. Lance Lynn has something wrong with his arm that he is pitching through and throwing almost only fastballs.   Do you have a source for any of this? Because Mike Matheny would probably like to be filled in.
baseball,3du2s4,evanb_,-3,Sun Jul 19 17:37:53 2015 UTC,"Do you need a source for Lance Lynn? He had an MRI and dropped all off speed pitches. He's getting great results but something is wrong. He was so stressed out in that interview after his first all fastball game. There's not much to source other than Lynn saying he's fine and his recent short stint out of the rotation.  And the Mets have been taking precautions here and there all year long. Matz is injured right now but fresh, and they still have Gee and Niese for the time being.   Since Michael Wacha had shoulder problems in 2014 and Carlos Martinez has never thrown more than 150 innings in his career, the Cardinals are expecting to limit both starting pitchers at some point this season, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  “We have some numbers in mind, but not early on,” manager Mike Matheny said. “I think you've got to wait and see where things are leading. If they're throwing high volume, we'll worry about that down the road, and we can use the All-Star break or we can use some of our off days to change things. This isn't something where we need to start holding them back now. I don't think that's a great idea. But we don't need to push.”  Maybe Matheny is going to back off innings limits. But that is a huge risk. I would expect a plan to spread them out a little more, maybe drop the pitch count cap a little. It's just the way it goes with young stud SP that didn't throw 180+ last year... Particularly when your gunning for a playoff run.  I don't mean to discount the Cards. I'm just saying, 'Of course they could use another #1 or #2'."
baseball,3du2s4,JohnnyWaffleseed,4,Sun Jul 19 16:33:07 2015 UTC,"Lynn has never thrown many off-speed pitches and has been a lot more successful locating his fastball. Since moving into the rotation he's increased his fastball usage every season. He has a really hard time hitting the zone with his breaking stuff but his fastball is one of the most consistently dominant in baseball.  I don't know if you're an amateur psychologist, but Lynn doesn't seem stressed at all. If anything, that interview talking about his repertoire was the most talkative and jovial I've ever seen Lynn. I honestly don't think you could be more wrong.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5dvlF002mw  That quote doesn't make it sound like there will be innings limits at all. I'd be much more confident in Wacha and Martinez going forward than Miller, but that's based on watching them all pitch."
baseball,3du2s4,evanb_,0,Sun Jul 19 16:49:36 2015 UTC,"Well good thing you're not the manager. I trust Matheny will not let those young controllable assets hit 230 innings through the playoffs. Wacha played superman once already. If 210 innings is the target (trust me, there is a target. This is 2015) they may need to slow them down a little."

baseball,3du2s4,tjsimmons,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason they made that trade, I think, was because we were having too much fun in the dugout and it was time to buckle down and play the game."

baseball,3du2s4,woodsbre,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:06:38 2015 UTC,"What's funny is that I've got 5/8 of our normal offensive lineup (Carpenter, Adams (before the injury), Holliday, Peralta, and Molina).  I'm at .500 in that league (weekly H2H points).  I just took a look in the /r/cardinals league I'm in, and taking the lead 4 starters for the Cardinals, I'd have 1358 points so far between Lynn, Lackey, Wacha, and CarMart.  If I look at the lead 4 for the Dodgers, for instance, 1395 (but Kershaw/Greinke are 2/3 of that!).  My league's scoring favors guys who rack up high K counts (+2 for a K, -0.5 per ER).  The guy who's actually leading the league has his top 4 starters as Bumgarner, Gerrit Cole, Lackey, and Jacob DeGrom.  That gets him 1432 in that league's scoring."

baseball,3du2s4,the_wolverine88,4,Sun Jul 19 20:20:57 2015 UTC,"It's why they have the best record in baseball. At least in the NL, it's about run mitigation, almost more than run scoring. Reason why Mets/Cubs are in contention with awful O numbers while D'backs and Rockies aren't in the picture despite owning NL's best offenses."
baseball,3du2s4,Bomber2Musketeer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:22:44 2015 UTC,"In the Rockies' case those offensive numbers are mainly due to playing at Coors field. They're 6th in total runs scored in the majors, but when you look at a park and league adjusted offensive stat they're actually 21st in the majors by wRC+. As a team they're actually only 4 wRC+ better than the Mets, but they also have the worst FIP and pitching staff fWAR in the majors while the Mets rank 6th and 5th in the majors in those categories. After we take out the Coors effect the Rockies have been pretty bad at both aspects of the game, not just pitching. Definitely agreed on the Diamondbacks though - 5th in the NL in wRC+, 3rd worst in the NL by FIP...they can hit but they can't pitch and pitching seems to be the great predictor for NL teams this year. All of the top 6 teams in the NL by FIP are above .500, and out of the other 9 teams in the league only 1 is above .500."

baseball,3dw9xu,Harrolddilshore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:52:44 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't want to trade for any starting pitcher. Hold onto our prospects and sign one of those starters in free agency.
baseball,3dw9xu,djb2287,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:49 2015 UTC,That's the reason we have so many prospects though... to trade them away. What value does Vogelbach give the Cubs realistically?

baseball,3dw9xu,djb2287,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:32 2015 UTC,"We need hitting NOW... we don't need pitching now true. But we don't have any high quality arms in our minors that I'm totally confident will pan out. Maybe CJ... maybe. This was Theo's plan the entire time... stock up on position players and trade them away for pitching. Gimme a Cole Hamels or Johnny Cueto now for Vogelbach, Alcantara, and Castro/Baez. And then we'll sign Price in the offseason.  And guess what, we still would have McKinney, Torres, Almora, Schwarber, Happ, and Baez or Castro. Not to mention how many 25 and under guys we have on the team right now.  I'm not saying you trade the farm for a guy, but we have enough to give and still have plenty of depth for a Cueto, Hamels, or Shields. Why not pull the trigger?  You can't count on Hammel to continue to be as good as he has been the last 2 seasons forever. He's having back-to-back career years, what are the chances he'll continue to put up numbers comparable to Hamels or Cueto down the road?"
baseball,3dw9xu,gandalfsmagicgaydick,28,Mon Jul 20 22:31:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty crazy that they've had the best starting pitching in July but the worst offense.  They're hitting .213/.299/.299 this month, good for a 67 wRC+. Helps explain why their starters are 6-3."

Guys like Russell, Bryant, Schwarber aren't used to the daily grind. I get these expectations that Trout/Harper is the norm when they're really once in a generation players to be playing at such a high level so young.  The difference in this team being a wild card team and being a serious threat in October is getting all of the pieces to click. Hopefully I think we have the coaching to do just that.

baseball,3dvqlh,herpderpgg,9,Mon Jul 20 00:21:22 2015 UTC,"No such thing as excess pitching.  I do think they're going to trade one of the second tier guys like Montero or Ynoa, plus Nimmo maybe, for an outfielder or a shortstop to move Tejada back to the bench.  But I like that they're not forcing it.  I don't think they're as desperate as people are making out.  If the right deal presents itself, do it.  If not, look at d'Arnaud, Wright and Matz as your potential upgrades."

He's certainly capable as a starter, but I think it's a place where they can improve if they go out and get a better guy.  If David comes back this year I certainly wouldn't be upset if Tejada became the infield supersub."

Especially those who know nothing of baseball or even pay attention to all the aspects of the sport.  Been to the Ballpark in Arlington 4 times and every time the fans around me there were just obnoxious idiots who clearly only became Rangers fans when they had the two runs to the series.  Not gonna say all their fans are like this and I am sure we have ours as well but I have met a lot more obnoxious Rangers fans in recent years than ever before.    It was pretty poor taste of a lot of those guys to talk trash about a city they most likely have never visited and probably only drove through.

If you take the Brewers best 69 game stretch last year (42-27 from Apr 4th to Jun 19th) and made it the last 69 games this year, their total record becomes 83-79.

baseball,3dvtuj,ITrageGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:32:38 2015 UTC,The Mets are 4 games over .500 and within 2 games of a playoff spot.
baseball,3dvtuj,three_dee,3,Mon Jul 20 08:39:57 2015 UTC,And their offense is scoring 3.46 runs per game which is ranked 29th. Their offense is BAD and it's painful to watch.
baseball,3dvtuj,ITrageGuy,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:05:18 2015 UTC,"And that in a nutshell is the new mutation of Mets fan that has emerged over the last decade or so.  Nothing matters, even wins and losses, if you can find something to complain about.  The beleaguered and malnourished offense is finding ways to scrape and claw and providing just barely enough scoring to win more days than it isn't, despite being massacred by injuries to their best offensive players, one after the other, all season.  With the result being that they are hovering a little over .500 and well within reach of a playoff spot.  In most areas around the league, this would be a positive, but with the Mets, this is somehow, not just a bad thing, but despicable and unbearable to the point of relentless self-mockery.  If the Mets would one day win the World Series in 7 games, this type of people would complain they didn't sweep."

baseball,3dzcnr,Hugo_Hackenbush,3,Mon Jul 20 19:34:36 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he goes up there and bats whichever side he wants.

baseball,3dvbkd,rightoldboy,13,Sun Jul 19 21:10:25 2015 UTC,I believe he had retired 28 straight batters until Michael Taylor singled off of him in the 3rd today. A hidden perfecto.
baseball,3dvbkd,taco_junior,-28,Mon Jul 20 00:49:37 2015 UTC,"Except for that homer he gave up to Trout in the allstar game. He's been unreal though.   If you think Posey (and everyone else on the giants for that matter) doesn't already know Greinkes pitches and patterns, you're kidding yourself. These guys study their opponents like crazy."
baseball,3dvbkd,Fuzzylumpkin,10,Sun Jul 19 21:23:04 2015 UTC,Division Rival behind the plate which is an extremely deadly hitter. Pretty sure they don't want to give away big pitches.
baseball,3dvbkd,BigPaenix,3,Sun Jul 19 21:42:16 2015 UTC,Does that really make sense? I'm not even really sure what you mean by that. Posey knows what pitches Greinke has and I'd bet he already knows Greinkes tendencies.
baseball,3dvbkd,Fuzzylumpkin,5,Sun Jul 19 21:54:13 2015 UTC,"If he can understand the pitch and how it moves, then he can remember it and explain it to the team. Buster Posey is no pushover offensively. He's a monster that can remain calm and dominates first pitch fastballs. He was catching so he was calling pitches for Greinke. So when he bats against him, he'll have a better chance at guessing the next pitch."
baseball,3dvbkd,BigPaenix,4,Sun Jul 19 22:04:11 2015 UTC,"My thinking is that there's no way he doesn't already know those things. He's faced Greinke enough. They all have. Maybe he would have garnered a slightly better understanding of Greinke's movement and tendencies, but I think he would have only been building on a well established base of knowledge."
baseball,3dvbkd,Fuzzylumpkin,4,Sun Jul 19 22:08:25 2015 UTC,Yes but there's a huge difference between standing next to a pitch and being behind the pitch
baseball,3dvbkd,BigPaenix,22,Sun Jul 19 22:18:33 2015 UTC,I'm sure he was giving 100% during an exhibition game.
baseball,3dvbkd,Trap-Lord,-3,Sun Jul 19 21:37:54 2015 UTC,"Do you think he wasn't? These guys are huge competitors. And given that he knew he would only be out there for an inning or two, I don't see how he wouldn't be trying his darndest.   With that said, it's a totally different situation than he's used to and pitchers are creatures of habit, so it was obviously just an off night. Given a playoff or interleague game between the angels and Dodgers, that match up would be a lot more interesting. The edge in any given at bat probably goes to Greinke."
baseball,3dvbkd,Fuzzylumpkin,21,Sun Jul 19 21:58:50 2015 UTC,"so it was obviously just an off night   I don't think it was an off night at all. He missed his spot on that pitch by maybe an inch, it was still on the outside edge of the plate, and the best player in the game muscled it over a short porch for a home run that only gets out in that ballpark and maybe 1-2 others.  Props to Trout for taking Zack deep in the middle of this absolutely dominant stretch he's having."

baseball,3dvbkd,Fuzzylumpkin,9,Sun Jul 19 22:24:52 2015 UTC,"I don't blame Greinke and Kershaw for shitting the bed in the All Star game. It was obvious they weren't pitching at the caliber they normally do, but for good reason. They had Posey behind the plate and neither of them wanted to give away their pitches. I'm glad the game turned out the way it did though, I'm just saying."
baseball,3dvbkd,mental_fingers,7,Sun Jul 19 21:38:43 2015 UTC,"Damn, I hadn't even thought of the Posey wrinkle. That's really interesting"
baseball,3dvbkd,Asa37,7,Sun Jul 19 21:45:00 2015 UTC,"Yep Kershaw threw the change up and fastball combo, only 1 curve. More curves would've completely saved himself but he doesn't wanna give away his best stuff I guess."
baseball,3dvbkd,Fuzzylumpkin,2,Sun Jul 19 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"Everyone already knows what his curve looks like, so I'm not sure what you mean."
baseball,3dvbkd,Fuzzylumpkin,2,Sun Jul 19 21:55:21 2015 UTC,"As I said to the other guy, Does that really make sense? I'm not even really sure what you mean by that. Posey knows what pitches Greinke has and I'd bet he already knows Greinkes tendencies."
baseball,3dvbkd,mental_fingers,6,Sun Jul 19 21:59:47 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to sound like a douche so don't take it that way. They had a division rival behind the plate that they were pitching to, when you catch for someone you get a better feel for how they set up for their pitches and how they throw. Posey is a threat when he's in the batters box as well, so if he knows how these guys set up, he has a better chance of making contact. Make sense? Plus the Giants are a threat come postseason time, so why take that chance?"
baseball,3dvbkd,Fuzzylumpkin,4,Sun Jul 19 22:19:43 2015 UTC,I feel you.

baseball,3dv8lf,demerdar,5,Mon Jul 20 03:54:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I am never happy when a player gets hurt but you better believe the fan in me gets a sort of satisfaction when I learn a rival team won't be at top form.   Aaron Rodgers and Miguel Cabrera missing a game or two doesn't upset me at all.
baseball,3dv8lf,Footballvike81,4,Mon Jul 20 03:56:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's like, yeah, they're a person, but then also my team's chances of doing better when we face you just got a hell of a lot better."

baseball,3dv8lf,Rbaner,30,Sun Jul 19 22:50:23 2015 UTC,"I've said this to about 400 different people today, but over Verlander's last two years he's been worth 7.4 fWAR, one of which he was pitching through recovering from core muscle surgery.  He is now struggling coming off of an injury to his pitching arm.  This does not, in any way, shape, or form, mean his career is over."
baseball,3dv8lf,STNbrossy,25,Mon Jul 20 05:06:19 2015 UTC,Plus he's signed until 2019... There's a very low chance he's gone before that (unless he retires or something).
baseball,3dv8lf,cresc,5,Mon Jul 20 00:14:33 2015 UTC,4.8 of that fWAR was from 2013 when he had a decent season to be fair though.
baseball,3dv8lf,GraemeTaylor,7,Sun Jul 19 20:31:08 2015 UTC,I hope he figures it out! That contract is going to be a burden for the Tigers.
baseball,3dv8lf,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,7,Sun Jul 19 20:45:03 2015 UTC,"Career isn't over. If you saw his performance against Minnesota before the break, you'd know.  However, he and C.C. are the current faces of bad contracts."
baseball,3dv8lf,GraemeTaylor,5,Mon Jul 20 05:40:52 2015 UTC,"I saw his game against us before that, it was pretty bad. Relying only on the curveball worked for a few innings, but then the Jays adjusted and things blew up. His fastball is not good anymore."
baseball,3dv8lf,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,8,Sun Jul 19 20:21:54 2015 UTC,"He has been pitching 97 on his fastball for the first time this year. I'm not saying that he's anywhere near where he used to be, but it's ridiculous to say he's ready for retirement."
baseball,3dv8lf,Krunklock,15,Sun Jul 19 21:31:17 2015 UTC,Pitch f/x data:    Year Average Velocity Max Velocity ERA    2007 94.1 101.7 3.66   2008 93.7 99.7 4.84   2009 95.6 101.0 3.45   2010 95.5 101.6 3.37   2011 95.0 101.4 2.40   2012 94.7 101.5 2.64   2013 94.0 99.9 3.46   2014 93.1 98.0 4.54   2015 93.2 96.9 6.62    He has very clearly lost velocity on his fastball
baseball,3dv8lf,Jason_OT,4,Sun Jul 19 21:48:34 2015 UTC,"He could barely throw in the mid 90's after June of last year, which was unsettling for Tiger fans.  His average four seamer is right around where he was beginning of last year, which is still lower than his average.  I don't think he'll be freak elite SP anymore, but he's still capable of being an above average pitcher.  He's also never been a great pitcher in April, which would be the equivalent of where he's at now.  If he doesn't improve the rest of the year, then I will be concerned that he may never be an above average pitcher for Detroit."
baseball,3dv8lf,FlannelBeard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:58:31 2015 UTC,"Why would you go through the trouble of getting PITCHf/x data, and then stick with ERA over FIP/xFIP/SIERA?  Per xFIP (4.92) and SIERA (4.79), he's definitely followed a trend of regressing about .4-.5 runs per year for the last 4 years, but 6.62 is still considerably worse than how he's actually performed."
baseball,3dv8lf,Iliketrainschoo_choo,2,Sun Jul 19 22:10:02 2015 UTC,Yea he had a good game going and looked great. Nealy vintage Verlander. Shame about the bullpen that game though.

baseball,3dv8lf,FartingBob,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:30:03 2015 UTC,Time to move to the bullpen. This way he can come out and just throw it as hard as he can every pitch. I think it would bring back his velo at least a bit.
baseball,3dv8lf,fantasyfest,3,Sun Jul 19 20:25:33 2015 UTC,If he can swallow his pride this is the best option. Make him a closer of reliever throwing 2-3 innings every few days.
baseball,3dv8lf,orioles0615,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:54:36 2015 UTC,"When he is pitching well, he gets ahead of the batter and throws pitches that sucker the batter into hitting his pitch. Just missing the plate, but too close to trust an ump. But his waste pitches are way outside or way low. His pitching is depressing."

I don’t want to sign a deal — and this isn’t to say they’ve offered me this — but I don’t want to sign a deal that is so bad that a future shortstop gets screwed because I signed a terrible deal. I’m not going to be that guy, that kink in the chain.   Also someone on /r/Nationals pointed out he is now the worst SS in MLB according to Fangraphs WAR rankings, prior to today's game.  Today certainly didn't help his case."

baseball,3dw4k9,Senor_Met,2,Mon Jul 20 03:35:45 2015 UTC,As someone who watched him pitch countless times as a nat; his stuff was not good or sharp. He gave up so much hard contact outs. His BABIP was low so he was very lucky. Hitters were often times fooled on backup sliders or cutters that never broke. He was not good last year.
baseball,3dw4k9,Nanny_McPhee,3,Mon Jul 20 04:08:48 2015 UTC,"He was good for the first 2/3 of the season, then he sucked hard at the end.  Hopefully the Cubs will get a strong, rested Soriano."

Really- they have one player (Brett) in the 300 club. No players in the 200 club. Just not a lot of power coming through Kansas City. You guys on with all your boppers are spoiled I tell ya! We savor each and every dong.
baseball,3dw9wi,vultrun,9,Mon Jul 20 02:19:43 2015 UTC,"pretty weird, you'd think in 42 years there would be someone who would get higher than that  Didn't realize how good we had it with the dingers. Just looked it up and there have been 15 different 36+ HR seasons by Blue Jays in the last 30 years with Donaldson, Bautista and Encarnacion all looking to at least have a shot at that number again this season"
baseball,3dw9wi,PassTheSyrup,14,Mon Jul 20 02:40:05 2015 UTC,Ballpark factor plays a part for sure. Just doing a quick search for the Royals on this year alone.   Home: 46 Games 32 HR Hit / 31 HR Given up  Away: 44 Games 40 HR Hit / 42 HR Given up  8 more home runs on the road in 2 less games. I don't necessarily think anyone on the team right now could hit 36 in a different park .. but I think we'd have a few in the high 20's at least.   That said- I'm pretty sure some guys on the Blue Jays could break that 36 mark at the K. Wouldn't you like to see that? Encarnacion as the all-time Royal single-season HR champ?
baseball,3dw9wi,vultrun,5,Mon Jul 20 02:51:57 2015 UTC,"good point, I completely forgot about park factors, probably pretty significant considering all the AL East parks are launching pads"
baseball,3dw9wi,PassTheSyrup,13,Mon Jul 20 03:55:03 2015 UTC,"This is why I have a hard time believing the park factor numbers. The K is just fucking massive, and the ball simply does not carry at any point in the year. In the spring, it's too cold. When summer hits, it's humid as fuck. Fall comes around, and all of a sudden it gets cold again. The wind rarely blows out. And to top it off, most of the air streams bow in to the stadium.  It's where flyballs go to die."
baseball,3dw9wi,Natrone011,3,Mon Jul 20 10:14:53 2015 UTC,"Which, I think, is part of the reason we can get by with flyball pitchers like Guthrie, Young, and Vargas.  The team is built for the park."

baseball,3du68k,mild_resolve,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:42:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, AL pitchers sometimes do have to bat, but it's usually because the manager made a mistake. I forget who it was, but a few years ago somebody mixed up the line up card and named two players for one position, and didn't name a DH, so they had to play the game with the pitcher batting. Also, if the DH ever move into the field the pitcher has to bat."

baseball,3du68k,Charmanderp7,40,Sun Jul 19 15:13:41 2015 UTC,"Nolan Ryan hit 0.6999% of the batters he faced. Maddux hit 0.6709% of the batters he faced. Jamie Moyer hit 0.84%. Tim Hudson hits people more often than any of those guys (0.94%). Mariano Rivera hit guys 0.9% of the time.  And a far-from-exhaustive list of guys that hit people at a higher rate than Nolan Ryan that no one considers to be headhunters: Scott Feldman, Doug Fister, Felix Hernandez, Rick Porcello, Max Scherzer, Roy Halladay, Brandon Webb, Kenny Rogers.  Considering Ryan had worse control than probably all of those guys, I'm surprised how many people hit way more guys than him."
baseball,3du68k,AsDevilsRun,9,Sun Jul 19 20:00:44 2015 UTC,"Fwiw, I'm guessing intentional HBPs are rare enough that they wouldn't really show up much in your overall HBP rate. So he may have gunned at some guys pretty often, and was just good at not hitting them otherwise (or maybe they were especially good at getting out of the way when it was a Ryan heater coming in)."
baseball,3du68k,CWSwapigans,0,Sun Jul 19 20:26:58 2015 UTC,Well Rivera's A-game was throwing cutters inside to lefties so not surprised a couple got away or people just took them.
baseball,3du68k,skinnyguy34879,-20,Sun Jul 19 23:31:12 2015 UTC,Nolan Ryan also faced tons more batters than Mariano Rivera
baseball,3du68k,Charmanderp7,20,Sun Jul 19 20:03:46 2015 UTC,That does not affect the rate at which he hit batters. Nolan Ryan had 2 qualifying seasons in 27 years where he had a higher HBP rate than Rivera had for his career.

In the other big 3 sports (football, basketball, hockey), trash-talk is part of the game. You're trying to get into your opponent's head. It's a constant, ubiquitous part of the game.  But in baseball, it somehow became ""rude"" or ""disrespectful"" to do anything close to that to your opponent. You can't even watch your homerun ball for more than a tenth of a second without the pitcher getting offended. Yet, astonishingly, it's okay to drill a guy in the ribs with a 90+ mph hunk of leather.   Jesus christ, how did we get to this point?"

baseball,3du68k,Sockin,4,Sun Jul 19 17:44:25 2015 UTC,Farmer is unbearable. He makes DJ sound great by comparison and DJ isn't very good in my opinion either. I'd love for the Sox to overhaul their announce teams (especially on the radio). It's hard to care when the announcers are so bad.

baseball,3du68k,BBS-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:54:26 2015 UTC,"Denny Matthews pulls it off most of the time, (HoF radio announcer currently with the Royals) but he's blown some big time calls with that style. Top 2 that come to mind are:   When we clinched the ALCS -""Kansas City... you've got yourself a world series.""  5 minutes of crowd noise  I would have really liked to know wtf was going on there at the time. Orlando's walkoff grand slam before the All-Star break this year. - ""That ball hit high and deep and it issssss.... gone.""  2 minutes of crowd noise  No change in tone, no excitement, didn't say the score, or that it was a walkoff, or where it went.  Anyone who just tuned in might have figured out that it was a HR but have no idea what the situation was."
baseball,3du68k,Gnux13,5,Mon Jul 20 05:02:18 2015 UTC,"Call number 1 nailed it. I've grown up with Denny. Have been listening to him for 30 years. That call with the crowd noise, it wasn't about him, it was about the fans. It gave us all a moment to feel like we were at the stadium. It was great, it gave me chills, and for a few minutes I could imagine I was there instead of at work across the country.   Denny is from the old school. He doesn't need to get super excited. He's there to impart the game to us and let us decide how we feel about it. And if you listen to him long enough you can hear the changes and tell when he's excited. Honestly, I don't think I would have enjoyed the moment as much after the ALCS if he didn't just let the crowd noise be the broadcast. It's something I think has been lost in radio broadcasting. I swear most broadcasters would have stepped all over that one by unnecessarily talking to just to hear themselves talk."

baseball,3du68k,hector92,6,Sun Jul 19 18:41:10 2015 UTC,"You aren't throwing it to actually hit the batter.  Batter squares to bunt, so the strategy is to throw it tight inside, around the belt line.  They have to jump back to avoid it, so they can't get the bunt down.  Meanwhile, the runner on first took off with the pitch, so the catcher has a good chance to gun him down at second.  It's a way to guarantee that the batter can't make contact, while leaving the catcher in a good position to make the throw."
baseball,3du68k,bullet50000,4,Sun Jul 19 18:57:08 2015 UTC,"well they wouldn't be taking off with the pitch, otherwise a pitch out would be more effective.  I can see this being a good strategy for catching the runner drifting too far off of first."

People seem to think that's bad luck that they don't have a winning record because of their run differential.  I say the only luck involved is the A's offense putting anything on the board in the first place.  Never mind that nearly every game the A's score like this involves imploded/imploding pitching.  You also have to score when the opponent doesn't simply fall apart.  The A's offense is weak, their bullpen is weak and their defense ir terrible.  No one should be blaming the A's record on bad luck."

Everyone who knows anything about baseball will tell you there's a strong correlation in run differential and wins. The A's record is very good in the last 2 months (2nd best in AL since May 23), and their losses can largely be attributed to a bullpen that went from good to awful over the off season. This means they will likely turn things around, and even if not, they have a young team with an insane, young starting rotation which will put them in a good place next year."

baseball,3dwoyg,SouthernDerpfornia,14,Mon Jul 20 04:26:04 2015 UTC,"On a rate level, he isn't wrong:  Jason Bay: 121 wRC+  Ichiro: 106  But of course Ichiro clearly had more longevity"
baseball,3dwoyg,flory1aw,4,Mon Jul 20 04:32:07 2015 UTC,Can you give me a semi-detailed run down of wrc+? I know it's something to do with 100 being about league average?  I just find it hard to believe that Ichiro is only at 106
baseball,3dwoyg,thedeejus,7,Mon Jul 20 04:51:16 2015 UTC,"Offense-wise, Ichiro was only really good at hitting singles.  He might hit .330, but if he doesn't walk much he only ends up with a .370 OBP, which is certainly well above average but not going to be top 10 in most seasons.  He consistenly hit for a great average and finished top 10 many times, but only finished higher than 9th in OBP once.  He also hit for basically no power, so that good-but-not-great .370 OBP plus the below-average .390 SLG only gets you a .760 OPS, which is usually slightly above average.  Edit: just realized you were asking about wRC+ not OPS+.  They're the same concept but with slightly different weights given to walks, singles, doubles triples and HR - basically wRC+ weights singles higher and the extra bases a bit lower while OPS weights them 1 per base.  They usually end up about the same though."
baseball,3dwoyg,flory1aw,3,Mon Jul 20 10:23:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm sure you get this all the time but thanks for always sharing your sound input, I love reading your comments."
baseball,3dwoyg,jigokusabre,3,Mon Jul 20 13:23:21 2015 UTC,"wRC+ operates on a similar principle to OPS+. Instead of being based on OBP and SLG, wRC+ is based on ""weighted On Base Average."" (wOBA).   wOBA exists because SLG overvalues extra base hits, while OBP treats all hits / walks the same. Obviously a walk is less valuable than a hit, and a double is more valuable than a single... but is a single really only worth 1/4 as much as a home run?   wOBA uses run expectancy to weigh the positive batting outcomes in a single number. Think of it as a better version of OBP.   Anyhow, wRC+ compares a player's wOBA to league average, and scales it to 100."
baseball,3dwoyg,owlbrain,2,Mon Jul 20 16:11:42 2015 UTC,I don't think wRC+ weights extra base hits lower I think it just rates singles higher than walks since it theoretically provides a better chance to drive in a run.
baseball,3dwoyg,jigokusabre,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:25 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking, it does weight extra base hits lower.     Outcome wRC+ OPS    iBB - 1   uBB 0.69 1   HBP 0.72 1   1B 0.89 2   2B 1.27 3   3B 1.62 4   HR 2.1 5    This is why wOBA is always lower than OPS."
baseball,3dwoyg,IAMADeinonychusAMA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:53 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity - is it possible wRC+ underrates a player like Ichiro? I imagine a player like him would be more likely to get a hit in a clutch situation, and to stay consistent over a season. I'm just wondering if a .330/.370 guy might offer some hidden value over a guy with a lesser avg but more walks, just by virtue of (possibly) being less streaky (and maybe a bit more clutch in general)?   Just couldn't help but wonder."
baseball,3dwoyg,irlkg,3,Mon Jul 20 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"His last 5 seasons have really brought down his average wrc+, where the highest he's batted is .284, which for a guy with little power who doesn't walk much doesn't equate to a good wrc+."
baseball,3dwoyg,ManceRaider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:33:56 2015 UTC,"Even if you take out the last five seasons and only count 2001-10, he still only has a 115 wRC+."
baseball,3dwoyg,jigokusabre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:40:16 2015 UTC,"Ichiro's last 5 or so years have not been very productive at the plate. He doesn't hit for a great deal of power, and now he's beating out fewer infield hit than he used to. His average has dropped and that's where most of his bat skill came from.   He's still around because he's a capable defender and runs the bases well, even at his age."
baseball,3dwoyg,PixelBurnout,3,Mon Jul 20 21:05:11 2015 UTC,Hope you find it
baseball,3dwoyg,ProfessorEpic,13,Mon Jul 20 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"He hit over .300 for 10 years in a row, he also stole over 30 stolen bases for 8 years in a row. Doing all that all the way up to being 37 years old with great defense is fantastic. Ichiro was never over hyped. It makes sense for him to have a drop off he's almost 42 years old. Also Nick Swisher wasn't better at his 2010 peak than Ichiro was in 2012 being 8 years older"
baseball,3dwoyg,UrdnotWrex1232,9,Mon Jul 20 04:58:00 2015 UTC,"The guy has a career BA of .316 and numerous years of batting above .350, what more do you want from the man?"
baseball,3dwoyg,SouthernDerpfornia,9,Mon Jul 20 04:35:31 2015 UTC,"Well, the issue is context. Ichiro only hit singles. No power, no walks.  He was also doing this when offense was still nearly a R/G higher than it is now. His best season was 2004 when he had wRC+ of 131 and had a triple slash of .372/.414/.455. This year, David Peralta has a wRC+ of 131 with a line of .276/.351/.508.   Looking at just his batting average and total hits racked up, you think holy shit! But in that same season Melvin Mora hit .340/.419/.562. Shit was crazy"
baseball,3dwoyg,IAMADeinonychusAMA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:34:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the thing with Ichiro is just skill. Sure, he lost value by not hitting for power, but just in terms of sheer bat-to-ball ability, he was unrivaled."

baseball,3dwoyg,boilface,2,Mon Jul 20 04:35:14 2015 UTC,"C'mon I know it's your opinion and I respect that, but Ichiro is one of the best Japanese baseball players of all time. The guy was fast and broke the record for the most hits in a season."

baseball,3dvrc1,Randy_Newman,-1,Mon Jul 20 09:58:43 2015 UTC,"I actually think I'm pretty level-headed.  When things are worthy of criticism and negativity, I criticize them.  If you met me in 2009 maybe, when things actually were shitty, you would think I was the most negative Mets fan ever.  Because that was the time when the Mets had an expensive, shitty team with a dead as a doornail farm system and no future even on the horizon.  I think I just seem optimistic by comparison, because in the last six years it's suddenly become in vogue for Mets fans to be whiny sad sacks of shit, and I'm surrounded by disproportional, cartoonish, over the top despair and unfunny repetitive snark constantly.  There have been far worse times to be a Mets fan in history but it was always a badge of honor.  But if you read the posts around here or elsewhere, you would think the Mets are 32-62, not 48-44.  This is where we are with this silly meme at this point -- if you aren't intentionally wearing a giant KICK ME sign and making unfunny jokes constantly about how pathetic your life is, then you're automatically a Wilpon employee.

Gomez shouldn't of slid as early as he did, but it was not his intention to hurt Mercer, it was to break up the double play. Nobody is at fault here, just poor decision making on both sides. Shame someone had to be injured, but let's not go vilifying Gomez. The downvote brigading in our sub and some of the incredibly obscene comments that were being made about him in the Pirates sub, is out of line.

baseball,3dv0li,flfolks,-17,Sun Jul 19 20:52:13 2015 UTC,What Gomez did is against the rules.  You can't 'try to break up the double play' that far from the base.  Suggesting a dangerous and illegal play is the same thing as tagging someone out when it comes to blame is absurd.
baseball,3dv0li,rottengymshorts,12,Sun Jul 19 20:15:52 2015 UTC,"Gomez has the right to the baseline. He can do whatever he wants in it. Shit, he can do jumping jacks for all I care."

baseball,3dv0li,rottengymshorts,4,Sun Jul 19 21:25:55 2015 UTC,From watching the play it looks like if he was a foot more to his right then yes. But I think he maintained his position within the baseline.
baseball,3dv0li,SCsprinter13,9,Sun Jul 19 21:29:08 2015 UTC,"I just don't see why Gomez's knee is up in the air. If it weren't for that, everyone would be fine."

baseball,3dv0li,Raidenbobalay,16,Sun Jul 19 22:00:18 2015 UTC,Anyone who has an issue with this play clearly has not played baseball at a high level. You are inherently taught coming up in baseball to do everything you can to break up a double play. There is no sense in running directly into an out and it doesn't even look as though Gomez purposely tried to injure him. He did exactly what any player including myself has been taught to do since age 12.
baseball,3dv0li,Chelsor,9,Sun Jul 19 19:39:04 2015 UTC,Which is why every Royals fan trying to condemn Lawrie earlier in the year for doing the exact same thing needs to look at this play.
baseball,3dv0li,vultrun,2,Sun Jul 19 20:12:08 2015 UTC,Escobar was on the LF side of the bag and Lawrie came in late spikes up.  You can't change the facts.
baseball,3dv0li,Dysalot,-4,Mon Jul 20 04:11:39 2015 UTC,Except Lawrie would've been safe if he doesn't slide late. Gomez was going to be out either way.   Also- when the play happened- it wasn't just Royals fans condemning Lawrie. I think you need to go check out that thread again. The general consensus was it was a dirty slide.  Edit: Here's the thread for everyone who seems to have forgotten.   The narrative of r/baseball changed quite a bit after Hererra threw at Lawrie two days later- but there's everybody's initial reaction.   Here is the response of /u/Raidenbobalay  (the guy I responded to in this thread..) in that thread even.
baseball,3dv0li,RimJobRhinoceros,-4,Sun Jul 19 20:31:47 2015 UTC,Also there was no possible double play on the Lawrie slide.
baseball,3dv0li,MTLBroncos,3,Sun Jul 19 21:06:38 2015 UTC,"What I personally think Gomez should have done is delay the tag. Stop in your tracks, get in a run down, make the ball get flipped to second. Obviously don't run into a tag, but you don't have to slide in the way Gomez did. Delaying the tag would have broken up the double play without having to slide."
baseball,3dv0li,phone_of_pork,2,Sun Jul 19 20:41:42 2015 UTC,Why would he do that when what he did worked?
baseball,3dv0li,SCsprinter13,3,Sun Jul 19 23:50:20 2015 UTC,Get into a run down? It was a force at 2nd.
baseball,3dv0li,RimJobRhinoceros,3,Sun Jul 19 21:30:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if you make Mercer pause for a while waiting for you before flipping it to second, there's no way to get the double play."
baseball,3dv0li,flfolks,0,Mon Jul 20 00:01:04 2015 UTC,You obviously didn't read my whole comment. He should have forced the force out to be made. Delaying the tag (stopping where you're at and making it harder to tag you like in a run down) would have broken up the double play without having to slide into anyone.
baseball,3dv0li,rottengymshorts,-13,Sun Jul 19 21:38:19 2015 UTC,You are not taught to take out a person making a tag on you that far from the base.
baseball,3dv0li,YourGingerness7,5,Sun Jul 19 20:20:37 2015 UTC,Carlos never left the baseline. He  could've tackled Mercer for all I care because he was in the way. Just unfortunate he went down with an injury.
baseball,3dv0li,flfolks,8,Sun Jul 19 20:52:14 2015 UTC,You are 100% taught to do whatever you can to break up the double play.

baseball,3dv0li,YourGingerness7,-8,Mon Jul 20 01:08:44 2015 UTC,I guess if you cared about such things you would do that.  Is that why you responded to me?  Were you hoping to score some karma insulting the person being downvoted?  Sad.
baseball,3dv0li,flfolks,2,Mon Jul 20 01:15:18 2015 UTC,And your ignorance and lack of baseball knowledge is even worse.
baseball,3dv0li,YourGingerness7,-5,Mon Jul 20 00:27:24 2015 UTC,How many times in your illustrious baseball career did you slide tackle someone that far away from the base?
baseball,3dv0li,flfolks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:51:07 2015 UTC,"Probably more times than you, considering mine actually exists."
baseball,3dv0li,firemastrr,-5,Mon Jul 20 01:07:42 2015 UTC,Feel free to actually answer the question.  Though we both know the answer is that you never did anything like that because you only play a tough guy on the internet.
baseball,3dv0li,flfolks,2,Mon Jul 20 01:11:16 2015 UTC,"Starting a slide from that distance at a full sprint is fully within the realm of possibility. Mercer needs to keep his feet out of the basepath. It was an early slide, but not early enough to call it dirty.   Oh, and if I'm sliding to hurt someone, I slide spikes out."
baseball,3dv0li,Antithesys,3,Sun Jul 19 21:39:43 2015 UTC,They are almost always in reach of the bag and the fielder knows its coming.  You don't expect to be slide tackled that far in front of the base when going for a tag.
baseball,3dv0li,apiratewithadd,12,Sun Jul 19 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"That wasn't dirty, and neither is what the Bucs pitcher should do to Gomez on his next PA."

baseball,3dv0li,IReadYourStories,4,Sun Jul 19 20:52:43 2015 UTC,Also why wasn't that a double play?  I thought you weren't allowed to slide into someone unless you can reasonably be sliding into the base. Which was not the case here.
baseball,3dv0li,SCsprinter13,6,Sun Jul 19 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2015/official_baseball_rules.pdf   5.09 (a) A batter is out when:  (13) A preceding runner shall, in the umpire’s judgment, intentionally interfere with a fielder who is attempting to catch a thrown ball or to throw a ball in an attempt to complete any play;  Rule 5.09(a)(13) Comment (Rule 6.05(m) Comment): The objective of this rule is to penalize the offensive team for deliberate, unwarranted, unsportsmanlike action by the runner in leaving the baseline for the obvious purpose of crashing the pivot man on a double play, rather than trying to reach the base. Obviously this is an umpire’s judgment play"
baseball,3dv0li,IReadYourStories,8,Sun Jul 19 21:00:07 2015 UTC,"That doesn't apply in the baseline, had contact not occurred he would have had no problem reaching the base. The fielder didn't really give a clear path to the base"
baseball,3dv0li,unshifted,-4,Sun Jul 19 21:31:57 2015 UTC,"The fielder didn't really give a clear path to the base   well that's not really true, but the first part makes sense"
baseball,3dv0li,IReadYourStories,4,Sun Jul 19 21:15:52 2015 UTC,There's no way for him to reach that base without leaving the base path
baseball,3dv0li,unshifted,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:21:01 2015 UTC,A fielder is allowed to be in the baseline with the ball or else every run down would be illegal.
baseball,3dv0li,IReadYourStories,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:30:10 2015 UTC,Fielders are called for obstruction fairly often during a run down.  Keep in mind that the MLB defines the baseline as a vector between the runner and the base he is currently advancing toward.
baseball,3dv0li,unshifted,0,Mon Jul 20 03:00:59 2015 UTC,"No. You cannot be called for interference if you have the ball unless you do something ""violent.""  Rule 2.00:   The act of a fielder who, while not in possession of the ball and not in the act of fielding the ball, impedes the progress of any runner.   Rule 7.09(j):   Obstruction by a fielder attempting to field a ball should be called only in very flagrant and violent cases because the rules give him the right of way"
baseball,3dv0li,SCsprinter13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:31:39 2015 UTC,I think you're confused. You quoted rules about a player fielding a ball yet talked about a fielder holding the ball. Different rules apply.
baseball,3dv0li,rustyarrowhead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:50:58 2015 UTC,"The first rule clearly spells out that a player with the ball cannot interfere with a runner. Obstruction is defined as only applying to a fielder without the ball. I don't know how much more clear-cut it could get.   The second rule was quoted to show the language used in detailing exceptions, and partially to counter any potential argument that Mercer didn't have the ball yet.  Where is the rule that says a fielder with the ball has to vacate the baseline?"

baseball,3dv0li,rustyarrowhead,9,Tue Jul 21 03:17:24 2015 UTC,that's just a blatantly early screenshot - he was clearly in the base path and could've achieved the same end without putting himself in Gomez's path.
baseball,3dv0li,IReadYourStories,3,Sun Jul 19 21:34:05 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's when he started to slide which I think is very relevant. Once he slides that early, you know he can't even get to base, so Mercer tries to tag him, but didn't expect him to stick his knee in the air and hit Mercer in the knee"
baseball,3dv0li,StruckOutSwinging,4,Sun Jul 19 21:40:13 2015 UTC,"while it's early, if he's not impeded by Mercer he makes it to the bag. Mercer made at least 3 clear mistakes on this play:   toss the ball to second, it's a no-brainer with where Gomez is. if you decide you're going to make the tag, use your position and make the tag, rather than expecting Gomez to run into you or turn around. why turn your knee towards a player starting a slide? it's suicide. I understand that he was trying to gear up to make the subsequent throw but it's just a bad decision to leave the principle point of contact as the closest part of your body to the runner and without an exit plan."
baseball,3dv0li,JV19,4,Sun Jul 19 21:47:04 2015 UTC,"By the rules of baseball, a runner has the right to an unobstructed path to a base. He clearly didn't have that here. He definitely would have reached the base of he has an unobstructed path."

baseball,3dv0li,Forbichoff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:08:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it looks to me as though Gomez is expecting the flip to second, and is sliding to get out of the throwing lane. That's the obvious play for Mercer to make, and Gomez clearly made his decision to slide before Mercer even looked like he was going to tag him. A clearly clean play by Gomez that turned unfortunate by a poor decision by Mercer."
baseball,3dv0li,Irreversible_Rape,0,Sun Jul 19 22:22:50 2015 UTC,Gomez intentionally crippled Jordy Mercer. You guys can pussyfoot around but I played hardball and that Gomez is a coward!

It's like olynyk and love, yea they didn't want to actually hurt the other player, but in the moment they sure as shit weren't gonna make it safe for the other player either.  Don't think it was dirty, but it was def gamesmanship, and a baseball play.  Gomez gets no free passes either, fuck that guy, but whatever, hope Mercer comes back sooner than later."

baseball,3dv0li,Djruggs,-5,Mon Jul 20 01:05:24 2015 UTC,Yeah taking out someone knees 5+ feet infront of the bag is not dirty at all..  He had plenty of time to hit the breaks and force the 2B to have to go to the bag to get the lead runner.
baseball,3dv0li,Elopeppy,5,Mon Jul 20 01:07:56 2015 UTC,He was trying to avoid the tag and decided to slide. It was a split second decision so if you think Carlos had any bad intentions you are crazy
baseball,3dv0li,smiles134,9,Mon Jul 20 01:37:13 2015 UTC,"Except you're wrong. Gomez is entitled a path to the base, Mercer made that bad on himself."

I try to tell myself not to be mad at Gomez, I get he was not totally at fault, but he's a part of so many plays like this it makes me sick. I just want to hit him for the way he walks off the field without even checking on Mercer or caring. I hate that attitude."

baseball,3dwbpn,Ethanhekker,4,Mon Jul 20 03:37:18 2015 UTC,TIL he had a 19.5 k's per 9 in college. That's incredible.
baseball,3dwbpn,Ethanhekker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:09:23 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Was one of the most dominant and universally feared relievers of his era. I would be upset if he doesn't make it.  He was right up there with Hoffman and Mo, dominating through the steroid era no less. I would first ballot him just because of how scared the rest of the league was of him. Really, that's all it comes down to."
baseball,3dwbpn,Ethanhekker,3,Mon Jul 20 05:02:44 2015 UTC,"No. 900 innings and was only a closer for 12 seasons, although he was a great one. While he has ""only"" 300 less innings than Mariano, he has a career 24 WAR compared to Rivera's 39.8. His ERA in the playoffs is 10.03 too, with 21 hits in just 11.2 innings."
baseball,3dwbpn,Ethanhekker,3,Mon Jul 20 06:46:30 2015 UTC,"But I mean, when you compare him to Hoff the WAR is close, K % is higher, ERA is better, WHIP is better.  And if we judged guys solely off of postseason then Schill would be in.  EDIT: And isn't the point of putting players in the Hall is because they're ""great?"" Not everybody is Mariano Rivera or Greg Maddux."
baseball,3dwbpn,Ethanhekker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:56:35 2015 UTC,"And isn't the point of putting players in the Hall is because they're ""great?"" Not everybody is Mariano Rivera or Greg Maddux.   Yes, but many closers don't or shouldn't get in the HOF. Relievers probably have the easiest position in baseball, so only the absolute greatest ""should"" make it. I used Mariano because you brought him up first. You're right about the WAR - Wagner with 24 and Hoffman with 26 - but Hoffman is in because of his longevity. He wasn't at any point the best closer in baseball (except for 1998) but he did the same thing for 17 years. Wagner did it for 12 years in a row, and then his last year. Not to mention, Hoffman got LOTS of saves. Wagner had two 40-save seasons, Hoffman had nine. Hoffman also led in saves twice, including a 53-save season."
baseball,3dwbpn,AcrossTheNight,4,Mon Jul 20 07:13:17 2015 UTC,"Saves is a kinda skewed stat though... Wagner was def more dominant if you ask me.  I'm just saying if Troff gets in, Wagner deserves a serious look."
baseball,3dwbpn,Tindolmania,2,Mon Jul 20 07:14:33 2015 UTC,"Saves is a skewed stat, but it's the one voters look for. Traditional statistics have and will always be used for a HOF case whether you ask for it or not, sadly. And I'm not saying Hoffman should get in. I'm just explaining why Wagner shouldn't."

baseball,3dueys,bayerleverkusen,54,Sun Jul 19 21:20:19 2015 UTC,I think Harper pulls it off. He's that good of a hitter. He's just .002 back in BA and like you said we can expect an uptick in RBIs.
baseball,3dueys,beer_down,41,Sun Jul 19 17:02:20 2015 UTC,If he can stay on the field.
baseball,3dueys,unfortunatebastard,14,Sun Jul 19 17:19:50 2015 UTC,And off the walls. And if pitchers stop beaning him intentionally.
baseball,3dueys,vinster271,5,Sun Jul 19 18:36:38 2015 UTC,He'll get some more RBIs when we get some guys off the DL and our bats wake up a little bit.
baseball,3dueys,Bawfuls,2,Sun Jul 19 18:43:19 2015 UTC,"Yup, this is what I was going to say as well. He'll need a bit more injury luck from the rest of his team to take the RBI lead, though the lineup around Goldshmidt is pretty mediocre."
baseball,3dueys,FrostyD7,4,Sun Jul 19 22:11:40 2015 UTC,"I think hes the most possible, but the odds are always that nobody pulls it off.  Just takes one guy hitting an absurd BA or launching 50 homeruns and the guy with balanced stats gets squashed."

baseball,3dueys,ibeatoffconstantly,22,Mon Jul 20 03:53:43 2015 UTC,8 RBI's will be easier for Harper to overcome than Goldy overcoming the 6 HR deficit. So I think Harper has the better chance as long as if stays healthy
baseball,3dueys,sourdoughbred,3,Sun Jul 19 17:15:08 2015 UTC,And if Rendon and Span get back in the game that will help him out.
baseball,3dueys,LRROFOMICRON,3,Sun Jul 19 20:01:17 2015 UTC,and Werth and Zimm. No protection at all right now!
baseball,3dueys,andrew02020,2,Sun Jul 19 20:42:45 2015 UTC,Rendon might come back tomorrow. Werth and Zim are rehabbing. I think those RBIs are coming soon.
baseball,3dueys,teniaava,8,Mon Jul 20 02:33:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think Goldy has a realistic shot of having the highest HR total. Harper might have a chance, but staying ahead in average while catching up in rbi will be rough."
baseball,3dueys,Bunbury42,20,Sun Jul 19 18:14:57 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see Harper do it, but I'm obviously biased there. If we see a triple crown winner period, I'll be hyped. We haven't seen Harper play a full season, really. So he needs to keep healthy to do this.   Certainly is exciting to follow right now."
baseball,3dueys,Mispelling,5,Sun Jul 19 17:13:14 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see Harper get it (obviously). But I don't think he'll end the year near the top of the BA category.  My guess is that he'll rise in the RBI category once, as OP says, Span and Rendon (and possibly Werth or Zim, depending on batting order Matt Williams goes with) get back. I think he'll likely win the HR race with Stanton's injury.   But I would guess he ends the year around .304-.310 BA, and I doubt that would be enough to win the batting title.    Edit: Okay, so I'm a moron.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
baseball,3dueys,finally_not_lurking,7,Sun Jul 19 18:24:50 2015 UTC,"To end the year with that much of a drop, he would need to hit ~.260 from here on in which I just don't see happening. If he hits .310 from here on his average would be ~.325 for the season"
baseball,3dueys,amarner32,4,Sun Jul 19 21:00:15 2015 UTC,I doubt his BA will dip that much. I'll be surprised if he's below .315.
baseball,3dueys,CornDoggyStyle,4,Sun Jul 19 20:40:38 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to pitch to Harper right now. The rest of the Nats lineup is dookie. By the time we get key pieces back, it might be too late for Harper to catch up in RBIs. I don't see him breaking 110 with this team of plebes."
baseball,3dueys,Bawfuls,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:38:27 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to pitch to Harper right now.   Kershaw and Greinke struck him out 5 times this weekend, though he did homer off of Kenley Jansen in the middle of that."
baseball,3dueys,CornDoggyStyle,3,Sun Jul 19 22:27:30 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, you're talking two elite pitchers who can get the job done. But why would anybody else pitch to him with Clint Robinson on deck."
baseball,3dueys,amarner32,3,Sun Jul 19 22:49:04 2015 UTC,I'd love to see Harper pull it off. He's my favorite player in the majors right now.
baseball,3dueys,the_seed,2,Sun Jul 19 18:19:06 2015 UTC,Harper's got a legitimate shot at it. I don't see Goldschmidt catching him in HRs but can see Bryce passing him up in RBIs.
baseball,3dueys,skinnyguy34879,2,Sun Jul 19 18:22:31 2015 UTC,"It's only 6 HRs, Bryce could easily hit 3 HR next month and Goldy catches him. Just like Cruz on a tear and everyone thinking he will hit 50 HRs.. then 3 straight weeks without one! Every category is still up for grabs by a lot."
baseball,3dueys,flaming_scepter,5,Sun Jul 19 23:55:45 2015 UTC,If Goldy stays healthy he will lead the NL in RBI for sure
baseball,3dueys,soylientgreen,2,Sun Jul 19 18:23:08 2015 UTC,"Still too early to tell, although if Bryce Harper keeps up this season, and goldy goes into a little slump, than I'd say Harper has a pretty good chance of doing it."
baseball,3dueys,xcompanioncube,5,Sun Jul 19 22:27:14 2015 UTC,I think Stanton wins Home Runs. He's been out 3 weeks and Harper just caught up to him. I think Goldschmidt/Arenado takes RBIs. I think Harper takes Batting Average in the end.
baseball,3dueys,xcompanioncube,4,Sun Jul 19 19:21:39 2015 UTC,Isn't Giancarlo supposed to be out until August? Even then hand/wrist injuries are killers to power swingers such as stanton so I doubt he hits enough to catch up when he comes back
baseball,3dueys,MilvilleMeteorologis,2,Sun Jul 19 19:35:17 2015 UTC,"Could be til the start of August. I still don't see it possible where either Harper hits so much in that time that Stanton can't catch up, or that Stanton can't produce on at least the level of the other big hitters in the game. Regardless of the fact, I want Arenado to take the RBI category. I don't think we'll see a Triple-Crown this year."
baseball,3dueys,NoMomItsDubstep,2,Sun Jul 19 19:44:57 2015 UTC,Stanton is amazing but his injury may sap some power
baseball,3dueys,Thybrantalope,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:03:42 2015 UTC,I think you're right about Harper. He could have maybe ten more RBIs (number pulled out of my ass) if he had better hitters around him so he got more RBI chances and pitched to more.

He's the face of the era of steroids, and baseball wants to separate themselves from that era as much as possible but it's wrong, they played those games, those players competed and you know what? It was not only entertaining, it was competitive. I hate how like 10 or so former players (the vocal minority) on ESPN/MLB network are so quick to cast a bad light on the era and how they were ""clean"". I bet those fuck twats were the losers in the club house that no one wanted to share their PED's with, so why am I listening to someone like that? There were plenty of other guys in the same clubhouses that did steroids and weren't even close to as good as Barry Bonds, in fact they were probably worse than the guys who were clean. JULIO FUCKING LUGO was suspended for PED's/steroids! IF we're going to talk about how much PED's/Steroids improve your game we also have to bring up players like Julio Lugo, Gabe Kapler, Chuck Knoblauch, and countless other stiffs who did PED's and had no improvement in hitting or fielding, and were just as injury prone as an average Joe. So if we want to continue the argument that steroids instantly turn you into Melky Cabrera (that one season he was suspended), we also need to be aware that steroids can turn you into Julio Lugo."
baseball,3dunjj,secreted_uranus,2,Sun Jul 19 22:15:25 2015 UTC,"He only had one season with a ridiculous amount of home runs because he was getting walked all the time. How many seasons did he had with over 200 walks? How many intentional walks did he had? How many seasons he had with an .OBP of over .500? All where he was supposed to be declining.   Look at Trout. Look at Harper. Look at Stanton. These are players who are reaching their peak performance, who got into the league young and have the youth, power, talent and experience and show it every day. None of them have put up performance like an aging, juicing Barry Bonds. Hell, not even Barry Bonds had better performance than a juiced up Barry Bonds.   I know the guy was one of the best, and should have been a hall of fame easily if he hadn't juiced up.   You're looking at Julio Lugo and other players, but you should look at the 500 HR club members of the last 25 years and see how many of those were on the juice. Or people like Paul Loduca, who went from AAA to an allstar.  PEDs aren't magical items who would make you a complete athlete overnight. I've been seen motherfuckers go a long way cheating on exams, never get caught, and still fail the goddamn class because they couldn't use their cheat material in the first place."

baseball,3dunjj,callmeroo,6,Sun Jul 19 23:24:25 2015 UTC,"No, but they help improve bat speed, which not only leads to better power but better plate discipline and pitch recognition."
baseball,3dunjj,speedyjohn,2,Sun Jul 19 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"I think anyone can run into 40 home runs in a single season, if they're somewhat talented and strong, steroids alone can't account for Barry Bonds, did they have influence on him? Most likely, I can't deny that but having a father who was a former MLB player and a godfather who might have been one of the 5 best hitters in baseball history are a lot more of an influence on patience and learning to hit than steroids. Just look at Barry Bonds before he started ""juicing"" his numbers are just as consistent as when he ""bulked up"" outside of one super season."
baseball,3dunjj,secreted_uranus,3,Sun Jul 19 22:29:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree. I'm not saying steroids made Bonds. He had a HOF clean career. But it's silly to suggest that PEDs don't help you hit homers. No way he gets to 71 or 745 without then."
baseball,3dunjj,speedyjohn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:32:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Hank Aaron did it, Babe Ruth did it. I think steroids or PED's helped Barry Bonds stay healthy for a 20 year career but it was also what was available to professional athletes during that time. Every sport was a science experiment during this era. Lance Armstrong, the MLB, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning's ties to BALCO during that era. It was the BALCO era.   I'm just saying that you need to look at the numbers before Barry Bonds entered the steroid era in sports. He was the exact same player as he was when he ""bulked up"", he had one amazing season launching 70+ home runs but I look at that more as a career season for one the best players in MLB history. I can't consider it tainted because for 1, everyone else was doing it, and 2, he had the pedigree before we even brought steroids into the conversation. We can argue about players like Palmeiro, Pettite, Clemens, Luis Gonzalez, Brett Boone, guys that had obvious boosts because of PEDs but I can't say that about Bonds because it's not like he started doing steroids and hitting 50+ home runs every season, he didn't he still only hit 35-45 a year, something that a good hitter does. Ken Griffey JR had more 50+ HR seasons than Bonds, Willie Mays (Bonds GODFATHER) also had 2 seasons of 50+ home runs. Barry Bonds was simply consistently good, he just had one season that super human."
baseball,3dunjj,secreted_uranus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:58:44 2015 UTC,Bat speed in now way correlates to pitch recognition. Just because you have quick hands doesn't mean you'll have a better feel for the zone and be able to see pitches better.
baseball,3dunjj,OpenMindedMajor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:06:55 2015 UTC,"No, but you can start you swing later, which gives you more time to pick up the ball and recognize the spin/trajectory."

baseball,3dunjj,HW_Plainview,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:56:43 2015 UTC,They improve bat speed and are suspected to improve reaction times. They absolutely help you see the ball better by giving you more time to make a decision.

baseball,3dunjj,secreted_uranus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:18:46 2015 UTC,Exactly case on point the Conseco twins. Both identical twins that took steroids and only one did well in the majors. Takes more than drugs to hit a baseball. Plus it wasn't tested for back then. So can you really blame the players when there were no consequences for taking them?
baseball,3dunjj,DeLuca2400,2,Mon Jul 20 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"The Giambi brothers also more than likely did PEDs. One was Jason Giambi, the other guy was a bench player for Oakland and Boston, I think...?"
