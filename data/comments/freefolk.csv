freefolk,3dzqqk,Cat_Sidhe,5,Mon Jul 20 21:09:20 2015 UTC,"I always caught the vibe that their shades were indeed there and the real deal, including Ned's when Rickon and Shaggydog were holed up in the crypts going nuts on everybody. I'm worried about Ned's shade being at peace tho because of the Lady Dustin scheme with his bones.   Long standing traditions of respect for the burial of Starks being broken would piss the other shades off for sure. That might even be why they seem pissed at Ned in his crypt visits and dreams. They might have known he was about to fuck up and help to cause the chain of events that led to no Starks in Winterfell."
freefolk,3dzqqk,Fuck_Olly,2,Mon Jul 20 21:37:24 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping Howland (or some other loyal Northman) got to Ned's bones before that Dustin woman can get her hands on them. Fuck that bitch, seriously.     And I agree. I'm not sure how ""ghosts"" and such work in Westeros, but there definitely seems to be some sort of unrest among the dead Starks."
freefolk,3dzqqk,Fuck_Olly,3,Tue Jul 21 05:18:52 2015 UTC,"Lady Dustin is a next level horrible bitch.   Maybe Theon who heard about her fucked up scheme could tell Stannis, who could expose her and bring her justice after he takes Winterfell. He'd win even more loyalty from the Northmen who remember and if Davos makes it back with Rickon could get pretty much the whole North on his side by putting a Stark back in power.  I know this sounds too good to be true (if you like Stannis) but he has yet to truly show why he was Tywin's #1 fear of the 4 challenger kings and what makes him such a formidable battle commander. He's got some tricks up his sleave I believe and Theon may do what he can to stop that crazy bitch for Ned's memory.   Also what fascinates me about Theon is that he has been getting close to the Old Gods in ADWD and recieved attempts at communication from Bran and later suggestions from the ravens (and Asha surprisingly) to bring him to the heart tree near Stannis' camp. Theon is psychologically fucked, but seems to take comfort in the Old Gods responding to his prayer for a merciful death.   I think Theon may have a part to play before his execution if it happens though. I saw a theory that speculates that since Bran can warg Hodor, who is pretty unwilling, he may now (plugged into weirnet) through Theon's proximity to the Tree be able to warg into Theon who is such a shell of his former self that he would willingly allow Bran to speak through him to the Mannis for reasons yet to be determined. Great tinfoil with so many possibilities."
freefolk,3dzqqk,Fuck_Olly,3,Tue Jul 21 08:29:22 2015 UTC,"Theon seems to be having identity crises all over the place. I hadn't heard the Bran-warging-Theon theory before, but that's pretty cool. Well, for us to read/see. I don't know how cool it would be for Theon to experience. Though at this point, I suppose it could be a relief for him after all he's been through.       Even though I'm not a Stannis fanatic like some are, I would really like to see him do some cool military shit too. His storyline in the show just seemed so...unfinished."
freefolk,3dzqqk,Fuck_Olly,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"The theory is that Bran and BR can not only see through the Heart Trees but also warg anything close by one, which is how they control ravens and such. The ravens are saying ""Theon! Tree!"" And Asha requests Stannis behead her bro by the weirwood like a Stark would have done, rather than burn him. Stannis will probably take that advice since it would be popular with the Northmen who all want the turncloak dead. But Theon is so psychologically fucked and ready for death that he might be a willing vessel for Bran to warg and reveal something. That or Bran/Bloodraven/Cotf want Theon's kingsblood to feed the weirnet. I hope for the former.  And I get people not worshiping the rightful king. Stannis has his faults and he's not for everybody but him being the king who still cared and saved the Wall, his humor in ADWD and the way he's played the Northern campaign won me over to his cause. He deserved better. He was using the Red Woman as a means to an end in the books (hates gods ever since his parents drowned) and would never burn Shireen or march on Winterfell with no possible way to win, it just made no sense in any way."
freefolk,3dzqqk,Dolgare,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't mean to imply I dislike Stannis. I just meant I'm not a member of the Church of Stannis-the-Mannis zealotry.   I kind of feel like I transferred my hopes for ""justice via Ned"" to Stannis after Ned's death...since Stannis was Robert's heir before Joffrey was born, and helped Jon Arryn rule for years while Robert was out drinking and whoring. He's not as charismatic as Renly or Robb, but he has his good points, for sure.     And what's the one thing Stannis is famous for? His stubborness.      So even though I'm pretty sure someone will burn Shireen in the books eventually, I still have a hard time accepting the idea it will be with Stannis' permission. Maybe I'm just in denial, but the guy who is so stubborn he withstood a siege that lasted almost a year, sacrificing the child he's repeatedly said he's winning the throne FOR? No way unless something so drastic happens in the next book it changes Stannis' priorities. Like an invasion by The Others or something."
freefolk,3dzqqk,Fuck_Olly,2,Tue Jul 21 21:36:48 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah didn't mean to sound like I was calling you a Stannis-hater. I wasn't sure I even liked him until his decisions in ASOS converted me to a Stannatic. But I'd say it's a safe bet Mel and Selyse + her dickish Queen's Men will do the deed. Stannis straight up commanded Justin Massey to sit Shireen on the throne or die trying if he dies. But the way he phrased that order (""it may even be true"") plus the Pink Letter talking about his sword makes me think he's gonna fake his death and have Manderly bring Roose LB as proof. If Mel or the R'hllor nuts hear Stannis is dead they may burn poor Shireen in an attempt to bring him back.  Come what may I would be completely baffled if Stannis kills his heir just for a ~chance~ of favorable conditions even if the Others were right there. He doesn't think he's AAR, he just believes in Mel's magic.   D&D wanted to portray him as a zealot because of their own bias."
freefolk,3dzqqk,Dolgare,4,Tue Jul 21 23:53:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it seems pretty similar to the way people feel about the dead in real life. If we had graveyards with statues for each dead person, I imagine there would be a lot of people that would report similar things about the statues watching them.   That just makes me skeptical, but this is ASOIAF, so it's not exactly unlikely that there is something supernatural going on. If I had to guess though, I would bet on Bloodraven/Bran/Children of the Forest being involved more than the shades of dead Starks."
freefolk,3dzqqk,Fuck_Olly,2,Tue Jul 21 06:52:02 2015 UTC,"How would they fuck with them in the crypts and why though? Perfectly valid view still. That's what I like about GRRM's ambiguity on a lot of the paranormal and religious angles. The feeling of being watched in the crypts could've been in their heads and even the dreams could be just dreams or visions from BR.   I take the stance the shades are actually there but can't communicate well with the living. The Old Kings of Winter may know about the pact between 1st Men and Others that ended the old Long Night and see that Ned and co. fucked up by leaving no Starks in Winterfell or breaking some other term but are just unable to tell them.    Bran's already able to see back in time though so he may learn what the deal is through those tree-memories. He could then warg someone with a broken will [Theon] who wouldn't resist and can say more than one word unlike Hodor, and maybe talk through Theon to tell Stannis or somebody what the fuck's really going on with the Others. Bloodraven seems like he knows the most of anyone alive about them so he should want to get the message out thru Bran, who is most likely a more powerful warg/greenseer.  Tinfoil off, apologies."
freefolk,3dzqqk,4dams,2,Wed Jul 22 00:31:21 2015 UTC,"How would they fuck with them in the crypts and why though?   Not sure, but I feel there's a ton about Bloodraven and his plan we don't know. I think I just generally assume if something wonky is going on and we have no real explanation yet, there's a good chance him and the COTF are involved.    The Old Kings of Winter may know about the pact between 1st Men and Others that ended the old Long Night and see that Ned and co. fucked up by leaving no Starks in Winterfell or breaking some other term but are just unable to tell them.    I've seen this a lot and I like the idea. I've always been skeptical about the ""No Stark in Winterfell"" aspect of the theory, although during Robert's Rebellion I think that was true(Rickard and Brandon were dead, Ned was fighting, Robb wasn't born yet and Cat was staying in Riverrun for part/most of the war anyway).   I suppose 15 years could be enough time for them to build up and get far enough south to meet up with Waymar and his party at the beginning of the story?  I definitely support the idea that we'll learn about the Others through Bran. Also interesting theory on him warging into Theon. That could be fascinating because we could then get a Theon chapter after that and learn what it's like to be warged into. Can shed some light on whatever horror Bran puts Hodor through when he does it."

The Others could have reappeared around that time, just nobody who could do anything noticed. This makes the theory of a binding Always-A-Stark-in-Winterfell agreement less of a stretch. Still nothing to prove the Others aren't pissed about something else entirely and that was just a catchphrase because damn near all of the North loved House Stark (except Roose and that massive cunt Barbrey Dustin of course.)  Edit to add: Also BR and the Children do seem rather sinister and manipulative for sure and it's pretty much confirmed they use blood magic. Is it like Mel thought and they're serving the Great Other (if there is one in the first place which I kinda doubt)? Or is Mel wrong again like she often is and their ultimate intentions are to get the Others to fuck off? I think the magic they've displayed is more in line with the side of Ice but I don't think Brynden will betray Bran and take his young body like that one (categoty 4 tinfoil) theory.   Bran can warg people which BR has not demonstrated he can do yet, that's why I think it's leading up to him warging the broken and mentally destroyed Theon. Also just a beheading for Theon after all he's suffered with only a handful of people knowing he never killled Bran and Rickon would be too easy of an end. I think he's got a role to play, maybe to challenge Euron's legitimacy and overturn the Kingsmoot like Asha had planned."

Ned's the straight man, Robert the crazy ladies man. Except both are also badass fighters. Every week or two they get involved in some zany scheme that blows up in their face, but they somehow learn something valuable from it and then immediately forget it by the next week.    Warden of the East, who deserves the title? Does the title really matter, with no official royal army?

To me, it seems that Ned derives his honor from Jon Arryn, rather than from his Stark family. That being said, Ned was probably fond of Robert because he was wild, like Ned's own family. As they grew older, I would say Ned became more honorable and thoughtful about his actions, while Robert became more wild and thoughtless. I think both of them growing more extreme in their personalities causes a wedge in their friendship."

He actually asked me to spoil what happened to The Hound. He loves the character so much he just had to know. I told him about the Gravedigger and filled him in about the popular Cleganebowl theory, and he got hype in a big way. He's more convinced than any book reader. Then there was the time he told me he's been wondering whatever happened to Beric Dondarrion. I didn't even know how to put a stop to that, you know, just in case LSH ever happens in the show.

It's possible of course as much as anything else is possible in this series. But I simply can't see it happening.

freefolk,3dv8g8,derfuss,2,Sun Jul 19 23:15:01 2015 UTC,Maybe she'll rule the east while Jon rules the west.
freefolk,3dv8g8,Dolgare,2,Tue Jul 21 02:56:02 2015 UTC,"I think that definitely one of two things will have to happen by the end of season 6: Dany arrives at Westeros, or Dany prepares to leave for Westeros. Even if she doesn't reach Westeros by the end of season 6, there's no way she's gonna not leave the fuck out of Essos. Maybe season 6 will be about the war against the White Walkers and season 7 will be about Dany's arrival."
freefolk,3dv8g8,Dolgare,2,Mon Jul 20 02:40:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I think the rest of this season will be her gathering strength and crushing her Essos opposition until she (or Tyrion) realizes it's time to get out of there. Then she'll head out episode 8 or 9, with the last shot of the season being her landing or at sea.  There's absolutely no way, as some people are saying, that Dany stays in Essos forever. Her story would be pointless. Imagine Tyrion and Dany having two seasons with no interaction with/impact on Jon, the Starks, Jamie/Cersei, the Others, or the rest of Westeros."
freefolk,3dv8g8,Dolgare,3,Mon Jul 20 03:46:30 2015 UTC,"I still think the ideal scenario would be for her to realize she has nothing to gain by going to Westeros, and turns the Slavers Bay/Dothraki Sea/other parts of Essos into her own kingdom. Similar to how Aegon the Conqueror formed the Seven Kingdoms."
freefolk,3dv8g8,Dolgare,13,Sun Jul 19 22:11:17 2015 UTC,"I could see this happening if Daenerys was in her own book, but she's not. If Dany never makes it to Westeros it means that huge chunks of the series, including GRRM's struggle with the Meereenese Knot, were just giant wastes of time. Dany has to have a profound effect on the story in Westeros where literally everything else is happening. Or else she's been the ultimate red herring and we'll have been massively trolled.  In my opinion, your honor!"
freefolk,3dv8g8,Dolgare,3,Sun Jul 19 22:23:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think that would have to make those a massive waste of time. Just by being there, she has drastically affected a ton of people(Ned Stark, the Greyjoys, Varys & Illyrio's schemes, the Martells, Marwyn, Tyrion, etc.) and the fate of Westeros and Essos.   It would absolutely be a huge curveball for the fanbase if she decided to stay there and form her own kingdom. I don't think it would be that awful, though. I think the complaints about her staying in Mereen was more that she wanted to come to Westeros but no lets waste time in Mereen instead.   By making a final decision like creating her own kingdom, it would give her story purpose. Granted, a vastly different purpose than most everyone assumed it had in the first place, but there would be one. The stalling in Mereen felt just like that, stalling her plot.   It seems to me that the one thing Dany has really wanted(well, besides Daario...) was to go home. She was convinced by Viserys and others that her home was Westeros, but it really wasn't. She always thinks about the house with the red door.   I think that's what is going to happen, she's going to go home, but I don't think that home will be Westeros. She'll create that house with the red door herself, as symbolism of her creating her own kingdom.   I don't think that house actually existed before, I think it's something her mind created as a safety blanket. I've seen other theories about this, mostly based around the idea that the lemon tree outside her window couldn't have grown in Braavos, where this house was supposed to be."
freefolk,3dv8g8,Davos_Cworth,4,Sun Jul 19 22:44:54 2015 UTC,My question to you is why wouldn't this have gotten its own book? All the influences you've described could be alluded to the same way Robert's rebellion was.
freefolk,3dv8g8,purifico,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:51:10 2015 UTC,Because it's happening at the same time as everything else in the story? Robert's Rebellion was ~15 years before AGOT.
freefolk,3dv8g8,Dolgare,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:57:21 2015 UTC,That's no reason to include it in the same series. Plenty of books have been written separately with concurrent storylines. It's A Song Of Ice and Fire. What you're describing is a Song of Ice and Side Story of Fire.
freefolk,3dv8g8,Dolgare,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:00:17 2015 UTC,"Eh, if we stick to a literal interpretation that Dany is the ""fire"" to fight the Others(ice), then pretty much all the rest of the story is pointless filler. Dany also doesn't have to be the ""Fire"" part of it. Jon will likely be back in some form. Aegon is in Westeros now. Even stretching past Targaryens, Melisandre is around.   The story is enormous at this point. I think it's most likely that the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" is R'hillor vs The Others. They seem to be the source of the two most powerful(and possibly only ""real"") forms of magic in the world and are in direct opposition of each other.   Dany doesn't have to be involved in some ultimate battle for her story to be meaningful. If she died in the first chapter of TWOW, her story would have still been worth it in the sense of how much of the other plots her story affected."
freefolk,3dv8g8,mokoko__,2,Sun Jul 19 23:15:45 2015 UTC,Do you believe it's likely this is the story GRRM is telling? That it's likely Dany will never invade?
freefolk,3dv8g8,Ranman87,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:19:30 2015 UTC,"Possibly. GRRM describes himself as a gardener type of writer instead of an architect. He doesn't start out planning each little thing, he lets his creation grow and works from there.   I can see her story progressing to the things I mentioned. It may not have been the exact thing he had in mind when the story started, but I could see it happening.   Is it likely this is the route Dany's story goes? I don't know, I doubt it. It's probably a bit of a tinfoil theory, as I'm basing most of it on the idea that the main thing she wants is to go home, but she has no real home."

freefolk,3dmv30,Dolgare,5,Sat Jul 18 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"To be fair, D&D gave us ""Stannis the Mannis"", that was created as a consequence of show!Stannis being a boss. I remember that before season 2 aired that Stannis was very unpopular among the book readers and Renly had a much bigger fanbase. It wasn't until ""Blackwater"" that his fanbase grew absurdly and people started to pay more attention to him. So yeah, D&D actually helped his fanbase a great deal, but in the end they undid everything and pissed over the character. Still, we have to acknowledge that Stannis wasn't ruined from the start, at least. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor the bad the good."

What is happening at the wall and north of it is the real danger. Everything else, as important as it seems, is just filler.   the real threat to the world are the others and jon and biggus diccus just gave us a front seat to the mayhem they can bring, all wrapped up with a come at me snow pose at the end. When it comes down to it, when the walkers pass the wall, everyone is fucked. And all the shit they doin elsewhere wont save no one.   Hardholme gave all of us, readers and watchers alike, our first taste of what should be to come. And it highlighted that nothing else matters.   To put it another way, if this was dragonball z, Hardholme was goku and vegeta squaring off against buu, and everything south of the wall was krillin tien yamcha bulma and roshi having a bbq. With roshi reading a porno, naturally.  Basically people are hyped coz, and it pains me to put it like this, the ""bad guys"" just attacked the ""good guys"" in a pre-war skirmish. Instead of politics and backstabbing, we got war and impending doom.   Thats why people are jizzing themselves over the episode.

freefolk,3drn83,Cat_Sidhe,6,Sun Jul 19 01:19:16 2015 UTC,"The real War  To me Jon's story is the real story, with everyone doing a very in depth training montage. The reasoning goes very in line with what Varamyr said, this is the true war that matters. This may have accounted for some hype.  Plot holes  The plot hole with the Ice Storm is gaping when considered on it's own. However the Wall has been riddled with plot holes as of late:   Let's not ask the close Northern clans or families to help us fight the Wildlings, nor rescue the local villagers, nor have any Rangers scout for Mance, nor anything. One vote for the win Sam can keep his girlfriend.  I almost forgot the ""Why didn't the White Walker not respond to Sam?"". Not to mention after Hardhome ""let's not sail South of the Wall"" by Jon & ""Let's let the Wildlings in the kill the only Crow they currently respect!"" by Alliser   After these the Palisade seems reasonable. It's a shame as I liked how it gave the Thenn the ""Do what must be done"" personality, later backed up when he joined Jon to get the Obsidian.   Also #4 seems similar to Jon not just getting stabbed initially (while he's digging for obsidian). That said I soon forget it because the White Walker half-swords (can we call it that when the hilt is as long as the blade?) Jon where it seems to naturally fit, and as you said it heavily affects Jon.  Raising the Dead  Allow me to quote Melisandre if you will:   ""the more effortless the sorcery appears, the more men fear the sorcerer.""   The brilliance behind this scene isn't that we see them do what we already knew that they could do; the brilliance is that he has done it so easily and on such a massive scale. Add in the added edge of the ""We're coming for you!"" presence and it means a lot more.  Characters  Like I mentioned earlier, the Thenn was built into ""Whatever it takes"" personality built up, and the pride. This makes it more impactful when he allies with Jon when the White Walkers come.  And Karsi. God's she gets little more the 5 lines and we see how fearful she is of this threat thanks to ""Fuck 'em they're dead.""  These characters were built up so quickly and left such hugely positive impacts. Are you watching Sand Snakes?  Dorne and other plotlines  What competition did Hardhome really have this season? Dorne... Moving on. Meereen, at least the Harpies had presence...? Stannis... Good actors, but Stannis suffers to keep building St. Dany. Then along comes Hardhome. Finally something good.   Books vs Show  We didn't expect it because it didn't happen in the books. It worked equally well for Yara and for Dorne. Then BAM! The action, the nods to the lore (VS = DS), the fear for characters (Ed survived!), the cool new characters all at once. This was needed. If we're leaving book territory, this was needed.  FYI - My favourite scenes were:   Sansa's marriage because of how it made me more feel for Jeyne Poole than the books did, despite Jeyne getting treated much much worse. Too controversial for others though. Plus it's double edged for how much Sansa didn't act like LF's protégé. The Walk of Shame. Ok this would win best scene. The reason the episode suffers... Dorne. Fuck that Thurman Batman plotline. Oh, and St. Dany's ""Find this ring!"" plot set-up. That said, Hardhome had the ""The Wheel"" speech."
freefolk,3drn83,Fuck_Olly,3,Sun Jul 19 00:33:14 2015 UTC,"I think that's a solid point on the other plot holes at the Wall. A lot of those don't make a ton of sense. I think #4 can though, the WW let Will go alive in the pilot, so they seem to have the ability to discern what is and isn't a threat and the ability to send a message to the realm. I think that was just another case of it.   I think #5 especially bothered me, since they likely docked the ships at Eastwatch. Going south he could have just led the freefolk to their new land instead of the tense ride through Castle Black.    the brilliance is that he has done it so easily and on such a massive scale   I think that probably hits at the heart of the disconnect I feel with the scene. Being able to raise that many dead that easily didn't surprise me at all. So I didn't get the ""holy crap that's amazing"" vibe from it because I was expecting it to work basically like that.   Especially so after the ice storm thing that started the attack. Once the bar for their power was raised that high, it would have taken an Undead Kraken to surprise me when he raised his arms. Which actually was something I was half expecting while watching.    What competition did Hardhome really have this season?   Not much. I think the House of Black & White was done very well, though Arya's storyline was jerked around a bit. I would have loved to take away 2 or 3 sand snake scenes and given those to Arya to explain things better(like the game of faces, that scene was so awkward and had to make little or no sense to show-only viewers).   Cersei's scenes from her arrest through the end of the season were fantastic, probably the best parts of the season. Completely agree with you on the Walk of Shame."
freefolk,3drn83,pateuvasiliu,3,Sun Jul 19 21:20:42 2015 UTC,"My opinion about why people freaked out over that episode so much:      1.Last season up until that point had been kind of underwhelming 2.The Valyrian steel/dragon steel confirmation gave book readers something new to talk about 3.A lot of people like zombie movies, games, books, etc. 4.What varamyr said about us FINALLY getting a glimpse of the real threat to Westeros      Personally, it's not my favorite episode either. But I can see why others like it so much.     The snowstorm/mist thing, I can't answer. I figured they were going for something similar to what's described in the books. The mist (or the white cold as Craster's wives call it) is supposed to herald the coming of The Others, not the wights. And it is supposed to be so cold it makes it hard for you to breathe.       I'm sure the showrunners chose not to have the mist flood the fort area so they could show a big battle on screen. But in reality, you're right...it doesn't make a lot of sense for The Others to take out hundreds of people in mere seconds, then expend all that effort battling the rest one-on-one. It was probably an artistic decision. Same goes for the big ""arm raise"" moment. A lot of people just like things that ""look cool"".     A man can fight the dead, but when their masters come, when the white mists rise up ... how do you fight a mist, crow? Shadows with teeth ... air so cold it hurts to breathe, like a knife inside your chest ... you do not know, you cannot know ... can your sword cut cold?        Tormund to Jon in ADWD    The Others come when it is cold, most of the tales agree. Or else it gets cold when they come. Sometimes they appear during snowstorms and melt away when the skies clear. They hide from the light of the sun and emerge by night . . . or else night falls when they emerge.         Sam to Jon in AFFC"
freefolk,3drn83,Miogy,2,Sat Jul 18 21:59:23 2015 UTC,"The Tormund quote is a good find, I had forgotten about that one. That can definitely explain what was happening, and at least give some idea of where they got it from.   I think you probably got it right for why they did the episode the way they did.

freefolk,3drn83,purifico,2,Sat Jul 18 23:03:24 2015 UTC,"I was much more wowed on the first view and still think it was a good idea for the show but I believe you nailed it:   Is it the fact that there was an actual action scene in a season where not a ton of action scenes happen?    When I think back the only other ""fight"" scene besides the fanfictional unspeakably atrocious deaths of Barristan and Stannis was the Water Gardens, which were equally awful but at least worth a laugh.  The part of Hardhome that I genuinely enjoyed besides the Wun Wun shoutout was Rattleshirt getting wrecked by Tormund. Just satisfying to see that fucker get savagely destroyed by an awesome character."

I want to put the finale as my favorite because of how wonderfully done the Walk of Shame was, but there were just so many other problems there.   In the show? I'd probably go with Winter is Coming. I think the pilot was about as close to a 10/10 as any episode has gotten. Had they added the badass ""Dance with me then!"" line to Waymar Royce before dying, I might rate it 10/10."
freefolk,3drn83,4dams,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"I have seen plenty of TV shows, read plenty of books and I have seen plenty of movies. Was it perfect? No. But this was a great scene and it was brilliantly executed. I keep hearing all this ""people only like it because it was a flashy action scene and don't appreciate 'political intrigue'"" bullshit. That is a ridiculous overgeneralization. This was one biggest plot advances we have seen in a long time. The entire series people only talk about how big of a threat the WW are but we hardly ever see them and when we do they aren't doing much besides looking cool. In one of the few scenes with a WW we just see him getting stabbed in the back by Sam, other than that they have just been background noise the entire series. This actually SHOWED why they are a threat. On top of that we learned more about the WW (Valyrian steel/how the control the dead) in this episode than we did since season one.  So saying it does nothing for the plot is ridiculous.  On top of all of this it WAS a brilliant action scene. The fear in this scene felt very real. It was the only battle scene in GOT where the characters seemed like they were in fear for their lives instead of having generic ""heroic moments."" The episode managed to unite a large portion of the freefolk with the NW without needing hardly any dialog, just a well executed scene, and the reason was obvious (the ones who left on the boats because they realized they NEEDED to, not those who would join anyway. This is the only battle where the characters actually ACTED like they were in combat and not roleplaying a fantasy hero. Your probably right though, I only liked it because it was flashy and  i'm ""not very bright."" I guess everyone who doesn't share your taste in television falls into that category as well.  TLDR  How you can think that this is ""just another action scene"" in the show. Unless your in the ""if you like CGI then your not smart"" bandwagon."

freefolk,3dld0o,Cromar,3,Fri Jul 17 06:12:35 2015 UTC,"That's a dope theory, and would be a good read if it actually happens in TWOW (may it come faster than winter). fAegon would get the support of the Sparrows and it looks like House Martell is planning to support him. But Doran is at least tactful in the books. If a Sandsnake kills Tommen I'd bet against them getting caught. If Aegon was blamed however that would be glorious. I think he's a bit Viserys-like and Arianne may notice that side of him, getting Dorne to off him like the Tyrells did Joffrey rather than let him marry the heir."

The Gravedigger will be able to burn Strong's arm from the dissected joint, but will ultimately fall. George only gives ""bittersweet"" endings and SanSan would be too sweet for him.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported in 2013 that, while costs per capita continue to rise, the rate of increase in annual healthcare costs has fallen since 2002   Take the total private and public expenditure on health care and divide it by the number of people. That's your per capita number. Now examine how fast this has risen before PPACA. Now examine its growth rate after PPACA.

freefolk,3dnz8l,ChaoticScholar,-9,Mon Jul 20 01:04:44 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you're American, or from elsewhere - but compared to many country's, the USA has a robust, and compelling, political culture. In other countries, the biggest issue is typically something ridiculously mundane - like, outrage over increasing University tuition by $60/year. Or, look at Greece - where they owe a ton of money, had a referendum, and now are failing to honor it.  It's easy to say ""American politics are a pathetic joke"", but compared to what? America, whether you are American or not, shoulders a huge burden/responsibility of providing military aid/protection to most of the developed world. Nordic Countries can focus on nuanced social issues in elections, because America secures their borders via NATO. This is not a radical idea, and is generally accepted as true across Europe (I'm European).  You  may feel libertarian ideas are terrible in practice - but compared to what? Do you think Republican or Democrat ideas are not terrible in practice? Do you honestly believe they're legitimate, and don't line their pockets with their corporate sponsors?  I expected a more robust body of opinion here. Somewhat sad that most of you appear to be left of center, without providing a good argument other than tired slogans, and generalizations.

freefolk,3dnz8l,ChaoticScholar,4,Sat Jul 18 00:27:41 2015 UTC,"Libertarian ideas are shit because they are impractical. What I want in a society is to maximize happiness and progress and a high standard of living. Libertarian societies do not lend themselves to that end.  You save money by investing public dollars into programs that would otherwise be unfunded. Universal health care is cheaper and more effective than the free market as well as covering everyone, not just those who can afford it. Welfare, food stamps, the social safety net reduces crime and saves money because we don't need to hire as many cops, deck them out, businesses don't get robbed ad often, insurance costs for business are lower. Subsidizing birth control and abortions reduce unwanted children who cannot be cared for by unprepared parents, again reducing crime as well as reducing the number of people on the public dole. Amazingly, people tend to be able to stay off welfare better if they don't have to take care of a kid. Imagine that.  It's not a coincidence that the happiest and crime free countries also tend to be socialist, like Norway. Not only that, but they have an incredible standard of living."

But, why let a definition get in the way of a completely nonsensical post? Right?  Libertarianism states that there's no greater minority than the individual. Individuals can make their own choices - and - GASP - even decide to live in an area/location that has all the socialized pet projects you speak of.  But, again - don't do your research. I sometimes forget Reddit is made up of <20 year old non-contributors to society, who have never had responsibility. Thanks for the reminder, momma's boy!"
freefolk,3dnz8l,4dams,0,Sat Jul 18 03:53:55 2015 UTC,"Riiiight, because the aggressive backing of legislation that benefits big business surely can't be because political campaigns are hugely reliant on corporate sponsors."
freefolk,3dgzoy,Captain_Skyhawk,2,Thu Jul 16 04:59:20 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts I jotted down while reading each chapter this week.  ARYA 2 -  -The description of Stark men in new robes, dressed as ""The Hand's Guard"" would have been neat to see on TV.  Ned is littearlly dressed in the trappings of power, even though he wants nothing to do with it. -Arya as POV character (and surrogate for the reader) is particularly effective here.  Arya, as a child, has childlike expectations.  The reader, entering the book with certain expectations, is very much like that child.  The reader knows little, but can be naively certain that the hero will win.  GRRM is setting everything up to subvert those expectations. DANERYS 4 -  -Mormont said the book title!!! BRAN 4 -  -Well done GRRM.  Now I want to call my brothers and say hello. NED 5 -  - Ned as the fish out of water is very well done.  JON 4 -  - Sam Tarly will obviously be important.  No one else has gotten so much attention when introduced for the first time several chapters in.  -Sam is a great tool for exposition.  Through him telling Jon about his family, the reader is given a huge piece of the Westerosi Political Puzzle. King -> Wardens: North=Stark / West = Lannister / East = Aaryn / South = Tyrell. NED 6 - - First real details of Stannis.  He is described as ""Grim in his sense of duty. CATELYN 5 -  -Arrest of Tyrion at the Inn SANSA 2 -  -Sansa, like Arya, is a great POV surrogate.  Her excitement for the Tourney lets GRRM indulge in flourishes and detail that serve to provide detail about the history and culture of Westeros. -The scenes  with the Hound are amazing. NED 7 -  Ned learns more about the Lannisters from Varys.  The reader, up to this point, can still easily expect the hero to win.  Ned having a good day and having his suspicions confirmed helps with this impression. TYRION 4 -  -Riding to the Eyrie, Cat and her party are attacked. She arms Tyrion and his men and Tyrion fights for the first time.  Bronn is introduced.   Apologies for any typos or if some of these don't make sense.  I'm typing them as I scribbled them in a notebook and posting this while on my way out the door for work."
freefolk,3dgzoy,JHaiku,2,Thu Jul 16 12:25:23 2015 UTC,"So I understand how Stannis and Jon Arryn discovered that Cersei's children were illegitimate, but why were they suspicious in the first place? What made them decide to investigate - is it mentioned anywhere? I think I remember Stannis being the first one to suspect, but can't recall the details."
freefolk,3dgzoy,Dolgare,2,Thu Jul 16 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"I don't remember if that is ever stated, but my first guess would be Melisandre. Stannis seems like someone who would need a LOT of proof that she had powers, and her telling him this and him investigating it and finding it to be true could be the trigger that got him to bring her into his castle and in a position of power as we see in ACOK."
freefolk,3dgzoy,sinkwater,2,Fri Jul 17 20:18:24 2015 UTC,"Theory here, but Robert has a lot of bastards his first one was Mya stone and she looks like him and not to mention Edric. Stannis and  Jon Arryn know these bastards and see cersi's kids look nothing like Robert. Maybe that was the first clue? And rumors of Jamie and Cersi started when they were kids so another clue?"
