VaporwaveAesthetics,3doet9,makes_witty_remarks,8,Fri Jul 17 23:23:10 2015 UTC,"Yo, glad you like it. I made this theme using Nova Launcher Pro. This is the wallpaper. The windows and the text on the bottom are all separate Zooper widgets. You can find those files here.  The widget named ""main nav"" includes a background image of the Windows 95 tab, and invisible rectangles on top of that background that are programmed to open the app drawer, as well as launch the phone, texting, email and web browser applications, but you'll probably have to customize those to the applications you use. To do that, click on the widget, tap ""Layout"" and select the rectangle with the label you want to have link to your app. Then scroll to ""Module on Tap."" This will let you select the app you want that icon to launch.   Does that make sense? I'm afraid that it could all be a bit much if you don't play around with theming. Just let me know how I can help out."

VaporwaveAesthetics,3cfxru,albatrawesome,5,Tue Jul 7 20:13:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a kid of the 80's, and in my mind, the origins of Vaporwave come from coming of age in the backwash of the Boomers. The 60's were when the greatest indulgences were sex and righteous rage, the 70's were drugs and consumption, and the 80's was just... stuff. Sex had turned to porn, which turned into crappy porn, drugs had gone from pot to coke to crack, and freedom to revolt had turned to freedom to buy shit you didn't need, which turned into the freedom to buy shit you didn't need on credit.   For me, vaporwave's first incarnation as ""music for abandoned malls"" will always be its truest iteration, because I've seen malls rise and fall in my lifetime. I can actually name the soulless songs that have been chopped, screwed, and dragged out in 75% of any Vektroid album. It's not really a nice feeling.   That being said, being able to recreate the sound, the feel, yes the aesthetic of that small patch of 80's culture is pretty cool to observe, for me it fits a more mature approach than 8-bit or cover-band styles. It's just that for me, when it's done right, it does a scarily good job of digging up my teenage existential horror and consumerist guilt. The very fact that people used to not think McDonald's was a food for dinner or late nights makes me feel older than any school yearbook photo."
VaporwaveAesthetics,3cfxru,seen_enough_hentai,4,Fri Jul 10 04:29:35 2015 UTC,I think it's the nostalgia of it all. At least for me growing up where this sort of art was the norm. Back in a time I didn't have to worry about bills or working or studying.  It brings those feelings back.

Our team has just received the results of some market research saying that the millennials are really into something called ""Vaper Waves"". Maybe it has something to do with those electric cigarettes they like so much? IDK! Anyway, there's a new MP3 that the kids just can't get enough of called ""Flower Shop""(?), and we thought that maybe you can start a project that ties this whole thing into our brand identity somehow while it's still ""trending"" LOL!

VaporwaveAesthetics,3a18tu,3gaydads,2,Tue Jun 16 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely! Some of the SFC box art and designs are pretty timeless. Full edge to edge artwork, clean uncluttered lines, and using portrait orientation (as you pointed out) helped give a slightly cinematic feel to them.   Compared that to the US/Europe where almost every box had the game art squashed into 3/4 of the front cover space while the remaining area was given over to a really ugly red and black design with ""Super Nintendo"" in big letters so nobody was left in any doubt what console the game was for. Luckily we had our SNES console modelled on the Super Famicom!

Random wikipedia gave me these results, which I'll be adding to my background in a juxtaposition: Virgin charter, Carl Craig, Argyrocottus zanderi, and Junnosuke Yoshiyuki. I googled ""corporate phrase"" and found this ""At my old company (a US multinational), anyone involved with a particular product was encouraged to be a product evangelist"" in this site.

It doesn't attempt depth, so superficiality is a success. Unlike the later grunge or the earlier hippie/New Age styles, it isn't trying to be a commentary on anything or to change minds, so there is no explicit message to this aesthetic.

VaporwaveAesthetics,397utb,ChildOfComplexity,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:30:24 2015 UTC,Vapourwave harks back to the optimism of ascendant cyberculture. Old multimedia cd roms (before the were superseded by the internet)- Japan poised to be the world economic power - geocities. A time where the possibilities offered by interactive media seemed infinite. It's the soundtrack of cyber mysticism.  Vapourwave encourages people too look at old dreams of what software could be. It's music of a juncture and points the way to paths not taken. Arguably it speaks to a world where Japan didn't falter.

VaporwaveAesthetics,376npb,mszegedy,15,Mon May 25 09:03:35 2015 UTC,"By coincidence, there recently was a thread about that over at /r/Vaporwave .  I'm sure others will tell you a more accurate definition of it and even disagree with me, but for me ""vaporwave"" is based on late '80s-'90s consumer culture which has completely faded – malls of that era, infatuation with business, luxury, different cultures and tropical vacations, early 3D with its surrealistic visuals, brandism, elevator music, VHS, CDs, Japanese ""invasion"" in the form of technology and anime.  To understand vaporwave music in 3 minutes, listen to this."
VaporwaveAesthetics,376npb,erythrocytes64,5,Mon May 25 11:50:15 2015 UTC,"Picking a CD out of its shell is something most of us rarely do anymore, if ever. It's a distinctly last decade, but especially 90s, action. Like shoving that video cassette into the VHS, or blowing a game cartridge. Coupled with a clearly late 80/early 90s anime (essentially Japanese) it's the spirit of vaporwave condensed into gif form."
VaporwaveAesthetics,376npb,circlebust,5,Thu May 28 00:57:11 2015 UTC,"I suppose a concise if vague answer is anything that makes you feel nostalgic for early nineties late eighties visuals, sounds and aesthetics. Old commercials, popular design choices, that sort of thing."
VaporwaveAesthetics,376npb,whalecactus,4,Mon May 25 19:35:57 2015 UTC,"Someone once explained Vaporwave as the soundtrack to a distopian future where Japenese culture is integrated all over the world and consumerism is prominent. It's also cool to be a yuppie or a dink and to work in an office and spend vacations on beaches. Being ""normal"" is emphasized, and at the same time mocked."
VaporwaveAesthetics,376npb,Parkmayn,6,Sat May 30 03:27:51 2015 UTC,"As for the more detailed answer.   And the submissions are usually from Japan.   Not really, actually most vaporwave music producers and artists are from the US. Same with pictures – most people who find them are from here.   For example, one of the top submissions of all time is an animation of a CD turning over. Why?   Because CD is the technology closely associated with Japanese ""invasion"" of the west in the '90s; it's also symbolic of the '90s sprawling consumerism; and the fact that it's from '90s anime raises its vaporwave appeal significantly. The color palette also fits very well.   Where does the marble thing come from in particular?   In part it's a feature of the biggest style of the '80s, the Memphis style, which carried over to the '90s. If you are talking about the roman busts, they are from the cover of Floral Shoppe, album by Macintosh plus. I had no idea why exactly it was related too, but at the back of my mind I feel it fits. Some say it came from the early 3D scenes, I think it also fits the surrealistic style of the era with its checkered floors and pyramids."

Vaporwave aesthetics were made with the intention of being subversive of capitalistic and consumerist culture. Yet by placing it on an iPhone, a symbol of consumerist society, the makers of this case have only rendered vaporwave aesthetics futile and powerless in an act of ultimate irony. Now this case is only a poor imitation of the 80s/90s and has lost its meaning. If someone really wanted to be nostalgic, why should they settle for the knockoff which butchers old designs and not the original? Plato would disapprove.  And people say Vaporwave is well and alive. Certainly it has been gaining traction and popularity, but its original motive is lost, turning into a simple vehicle of nostalgia and fascination with Japanese culture. It claims to be ironic of capitalistic culture, but is it really anymore? At least not with submissions like this."

VaporwaveAesthetics,35x1a9,erythrocytes64,6,Thu May 14 23:31:17 2015 UTC,"Alright, I agree this one is crap.  But, my position is generally this: as long as something posted has at least something to do with vaporwave, I don't delete it. Let the subscribers decide if they like it. In 99,9…% of cases, the bad posts will get downvoted anyway and you might not even see them in the end.  I do this because I believe that mods shouldn't interrupt and dictate people their will. It will inevitably lead to conflicts. Mod's job is to fill his sub with content, keep it looking good and enforce the rules. As soon mods cross these borders, it will no longer be a democracy; bald eagles will be crying, and the commies will rub their hands victoriously.  Also, let me remind you, that THE most downvoted post on Reddit was when a mod delete an AMA which everyone wanted but he deemed it against the rules. This is what you get for being a dick. We have dicks everywhere, they are at our jobs and on the street, at local shops and on TV. Internet gives us a unique possibility build a utopian community where people spend their days talking about what they like. Do we really still need to enforce a police state in it? Do we really need to make some new user to feel sad and angry just because he didn't get it right? Slap him in the face in the name of vaporwave?  Then how are we different from other pretentious shits like people-with-superior-music-taste, people who don't recognize anyone who doesn't lift, etc? I ask, is vaporwave more important than people? Nope. It isn't. Because without our current 2,257 subscribers, this wouldn't be a community, this would be an album of someone's pictures, a Tumblr, if you wish. What makes it a community is a free will of people and their responses. These people an decide for themselves what they like and what is and isn't vaporwave, and our duty as mods is only to protect, not interrupt with their choice."

VaporwaveAesthetics,35deg3,erythrocytes64,1 point,Sat May 9 12:03:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! Yeah this was more of a practice exercise so I went pretty generic. I think as I work on it more I'll be able to add more of a personal touch.
VaporwaveAesthetics,35buv0,erythrocytes64,6,Fri May 8 20:35:59 2015 UTC,"Below is my personal opinion.  I think the quality of the image itself could be improved a bit. I mean, you can see the pixel ""stairways"" on the edges of the computer. Also, the photo looks a bit out of focus and overexposed.  As for the aesthetics themselves, they are captured pretty well.   One thing that bugs me is this stripe that cuts through the computer. It's cool, but I can barely see the start of the text inside of it.  I think if I made this, I'd add some band with a brand logo, mean like there."

Also note the reverse gradients on the different segments of the backmost sections.  As for the foreground, beveling seems to make a content's section header ""pop"" while they are still leaving some amount of transparency to actual content sections.

VaporwaveAesthetics,30z3cf,erythrocytes64,0,Wed Apr 1 00:25:02 2015 UTC,"It's just anime eyes on a human face look creepy. The execution adds to that – it's simply a rectangular cropping of a picture, and I think it just doesn't fit this face.   I personally see that two unfixable things are mixed here: purely serious american photography and completely non-serious Japanese cartoon. It's like Obama and anime: you'd be hard pressed to find any relation between them, and they could only meet at some poor Tumblr joke. Here's an analogy: I like soy sauce, I like coffee, but I also like to keep them apart."
VaporwaveAesthetics,30z3cf,erythrocytes64,0,Wed Apr 1 00:33:42 2015 UTC,"P.S.: to add to that, anime character face proportions differ greatly from real life ones, so photoshopping anime eyes on somebody's face is not going to be easy either way."

VaporwaveAesthetics,2vbihy,znidz,3,Tue Feb 10 11:48:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply.  From the MarioLand 3 to WarioLand series to WarioWare, games starring Wario have been awesome, I've beaten most of them. But the greatest thing is Wario is the Nintendo character I can relate the most to.   Wario is a dork. An awesome dork. Who also likes to act really tough and macho. Wario doesn't go helping people and shit – he just picks his nose lying on a couch all day, dreaming about money. And he's always angry. I relate to that, my friends love Wario too. His grin shows a life attitude.  There's literally nothing in him to dislike. More than that, his games always had some indieness to them, of that kind of a small game you know people loved making.   Wario may seem embarrassing for some, but in his vulnerability he is also far more of a character than generic silent heroes like Mario, Link, etc."
