advancedentrepreneur,3e5xzk,abadabazachary,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:36:32 2015 UTC,"Is it drugs?  Kidding, sort of.   Do you want to be in the business of buying and selling this product? And by want, I mean for any reason - for the money, the ancillary benefits of possessing the product, the attractiveness of the business as a whole, etc.   Are you actually willing and capable to do what it takes to execute?   I would answer those questions first, they will likely point to the right answer.   That said, here are some thoughts on the option you presented:  Keeping the parties blind of each other is likely the most sustainable, as you are otherwise useless on an ongoing basis. However if you do not provide some kind of value add, this is most likely a short or medium term opportunity where you will eventually be cut out.   The commission variety is the short term, easy buck version of the deal. Offer to source the product for either a flat fee or a small percentage of the first transaction. This is what I would personally aim for, as I generally don't like heavy time commitments into businesses where there is a clear end (you being cut out as the unnecessary middle man).   Option 3 seems like a waste of time since you already have a source and Party A is probably looking for sources themselves, anyway."

To answer your questions, I do want to be in the business and am absolutely willing to do what it takes. I am not sure if I am capable, as this is my first time doing something like this - but everyone starts somewhere. I want to learn through this experience and get the deal done.  You're right that the commission option is a short, quick deal. No future re-orders would come through though since party A can just order from Party C directly.  Regarding value add - I can position myself as a consultant. But it seems to go against the ""Consultants Code of Conducts"" to keeping the parties blind and reselling products..."
advancedentrepreneur,3e5xzk,overdude,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:17:03 2015 UTC,"I want to learn through this experience and get the deal done.   Good attitude, that'll go a really long way.    You're right that the commission option is a short, quick deal. No future re-orders would come through though since party A can just order from Party C directly.   I was thinking of the commission variety as the ""i don't want to be in this business in the long run, but do want to seize this one opportunity"" choice.    Regarding value add - I can position myself as a consultant. But it seems to go against the ""Consultants Code of Conducts"" to keeping the parties blind and reselling products...   Will this product show up with branding from the other company or is it something you can brand yourself? If re-brandable, your brand can be the ""value add"" that creates stickiness.  There are other value adds, too -  your expert knowledge, your ability to source a variety of products in the space / being the single contact for sourcing and thus creating convenience - and probably a lot of others that you can figure out as you gain experience with whatever the product is.   I don't think you need the value add figured out for day one, but you should be thinking about it. You might just stumble onto it as you learn the business. One way to do it is a problem interview - you know this customer has the problem of not being able to source the product - ask them about other, related problems they might have.   I wouldn't worry too much about following a particular code of conduct at the beginning. Do what it takes to get your business started (legally), as long as you stay within your own personal limits/ethics - what ever allows you to sleep at night.   Do note that if you're keeping them blind, you'll be responsible for things like returns, disputes, payment terms, etc."

advancedentrepreneur,3e5xzk,overdude,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:34:06 2015 UTC,"This can be a really good model. Be a consulting group or a skill agency, the one stop shop for experts in the category.

advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,goldishblue,8,Sat Jul 18 21:17:11 2015 UTC,"When I was teaching at the college level, I was in my early and mid 20s, so half or more of my students were older than me. After a while, you just get used to being the youngest one, and if it's not a big deal to you, it won't be a big deal to anyone else. Just don't hire the idiots who do demonstrate they have a problem with your age.   If you exhibit or suspect that you may exhibit any discomfort with being the youngest person in the room, you can speed up the process of getting comfortable with being the authoritative young person by dressing the part and acting the part. Wear clothes that signal that you're serious -- pressed slacks, collared/button-up shirts, low-key or no jewelry, etc. Don't act like you want to be friends with your potential employees -- hold off on the humor and be polite but not overly forthcoming. It's easier to start off a new relationship that's a little chilly/strict and warm it up/make it friendly over time than to try to do the opposite.   Your employer self doesn't have to be the same as your friend self or your boyfriend/girlfriend self or your family self. It can be difficult to define the line between friend and employee in a small business where you're working closely together, but if you can see your employer self as a separate version of yourself, you might find it a bit easier.   I'm sure you already do dress and act professionally and this is not meant to come off as judgmental or anything -- just sharing what worked for me when I was in a similar situation. It may be a mindset issue as noted elsewhere, and I have found that getting the right ""costume"" for my role helps me get in the right mindset. If it works for you, great; if not, I hope you find some other good ideas!"
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,O_Cressida,2,Sat Jul 18 22:01:29 2015 UTC,"I understand the costume aspect. We manufacture so it's a workshop environment and we work together so while I do dress decently, it'd be ridiculous to wear nice heels and dresses here.   It's true though they can't differentiate me being their boss especially because I'm more than 20 years younger than they are, most of my help has kids my age."

If you set the tone that you're no-nonsense, that you have a job to do and you're interviewing people who can help get that job done, these candidates might act differently.  You need to be the dominant character in the relationship (not ""aggressive"" or ""mean"", just the one setting the agenda).  If a candidate can't get with that program, thank them but no thanks.   You can be friends when things are running smoothly. Until then, top priority for ALL of you is running things smoothly."
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,chromiselda,2,Sun Jul 19 06:44:27 2015 UTC,Agreed.
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,adamkru,2,Sun Jul 19 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"In my 20s here, was in the same boat when I started hiring. Some people will always be unable to take orders from someone much younger than them. Don't hire those people. Some people will realize you are worth your weight, and if you lead them properly things will work out. Your age may not be the only problem, you need to communicate your leadership with them right from the beginning, make them forget about age. I'm sure you do this already with your customers and suppliers."
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,ihateeskimos2,2,Sun Jul 19 03:52:24 2015 UTC,"Yes same.  I started when I was 24.  Couldn't get any respect.  Obviously  you won't have the business experience, but the doesn't mean you should be ignored.  Ultimately it was a big reason why I left the smaller city I was living in and moved to a more progressive and diverse big city.  The ""seniority complex"" was just too ingrained in the business culture there.    Finding the right people is the hardest part.  That is why there are so many recruiters, headhunters, employment agencies, etc.  In this case, it sounds like you need a better pre-interview screen.  Should have never got a candidate with attitude to an in-person interview.  Add a few layers to the process.  Use a pre-interview questionnaire and a short phone call, at least.  Good luck!"

advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,bstevens2,2,Sun Jul 19 00:38:15 2015 UTC,"I would not have said it as harshly, but /ihateeskimos2 has a point.  I advise a friend who owns his own business and while age is not an issue, the employees not respecting him is.   If you get a chance read Good to Great.  There is a whole section about having the right people on the bus.  Having the right people makes your job much easier in the long run.  Here is one tip that has worked for my friend.  No matter what the position, have the person fill out a five question application via email before even coming in for the interview.  You will be shocked how few people are willing do even this little request.  We use it to weed out the people we feel will not the attention to detail we want on the team.  Use the same five questions over and over and you will be able to really compare candidates based on exactly what you are looking for and not be seduced by a resume.    With the right people hired regardless of there age, you will find your problems are reduced.  2nd tip:  You get what you pay for...  Extra $3-5 an hour, while costing you 120-200 extra a week might save you more in the long run in reduced aggravation allowing you to concentrate on sales or improving operations.  Good Luck..."

By laying blame on the employees she is admitting she has lost control.   First of all she needs to make sure her instructions are clear and that she sets minimum goals that are achievable. If she does this and the employees continue to fail to follow instructions and meet goals she needs to terminate. This way all employees know what is expected and what the result of failure will be.
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,bstevens2,2,Sun Jul 19 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and now speaking directly to the OP.  Hey OP, when the time does come to terminate please make sure you have a solid backup plan in place first.  The is an old quote, ""Never fire your dishwasher on a Friday"".  Unless it is theft, harm to other, or something else really serious.  Bite the bullet for a few more days/weeks and do what makes the transition as smooth as possible.  Again, good luck..."
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,therhyno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:11:19 2015 UTC,"Yes same boat. But some perspective.  Hiring is just about the hardest thing to do in business. If 1 out of 3 hires ends up being a net positive to the company, you are doing great.  It's actually really hard to make 1 + 1 equal greater than 2.  Most companies I think settle for 1 + 1 = 1.3 - 1.7  I've found there are 2 types of roles you are typically hiring for, both have unique hiring/fit challenges.  It may be helpful to figure out which type you are hiring for.  1) Purely executing a well-defined role.  If you are a positive revenue generating company, these roles should make up a significant % (75% or greater) of your work force.  Every action this person takes is defined in a business process and is proven to be a part of a real, money-making business need and is measurable. Roles: cashier, sales, customer support, etc  If you are hiring for these roles, you need to be an expert in them before you can successfully hire for them. And the business-smart way to hire for these roles is to hire and pay for only the minimum skillset required for these roles.  E.g., you don't want to pay an MBA to customer service.  Imagine you are interviewing for one of these roles. You know it inside and out, you have a training manual and job responsibilities already defined, and then you trial the potential hire at these roles.  You just need someone really good at these roles, nothing more.  So now you have a very clear set of things to evaluate the potential hire on.  All of the ""personality"" issues listed above become easy to evaluate (hint: most roles don't require it, unless it's a customer support or sales position you value that in).  2) Hiring for talents you don't have or don't want to spend time doing (this later should be moved to category 1 above when you decide you no longer want to do it).  This is hard, more so when you are young.  But at the end of the day, it's your business, and you own the vision. So you will need to sell the vision. But what is very important to keep in mind, these hires are only in place to create new proven job roles that fall into category 1.  Any salary/wage that is paid for ""exploratory"" or ""business dev"" is by nature a disappearing role.  Hiring in this category you are hiring for experience, and they may want equity (or should), so be sure you know what you are hiring for and getting into.  These are all things I've put in practice from E-Myth Revisited by Michael E. Gerber if you haven't read it yet."
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,roostin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:46:47 2015 UTC,"Heard of the book, need to get it.  Makes sense to me. The cashier jobs, customer support, aren't the problem of my business, it's the number 2 category I need to work on: hiring talent.   There is conflict of interest when I own the business but use their skills and they feel I'm too young to be ""ripping them off"" especially because they know my prices. I wish I could increase pay but at the moment it isn't possible and their work quality doesn't merit it. If anything their slacking sometimes causes me to re-do their work myself."
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,DroDro,2,Sun Jul 19 03:45:04 2015 UTC,"Good employees don't need more pay to work hard, they do it because it is in their nature.  They then get paid more in the long run.  And don't feel too bad about ripping them off, they are not the ones taking the true risk of starting the business."
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,papajohn56,2,Sun Jul 19 15:15:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Most people are risk adverse. You may be but took the risk anyway.   You have to make sure everyone gets paid and has a job today, tomorrow, and in perpetuity."
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,papajohn56,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:36:46 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I think too. Paying more is not a big deal if the person is a good worker.
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,papajohn56,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing the point.  Based on how you use the word ""talent"", it sounds like you use that word because you don't know what it is you need....  so you want someone ""talented"" to solve your problems.... That almost always ends poorly.    You say ""quality of work doesn't merit higher pay... sometimes causes me to re-do their work myself"".  Those are all ""issues"" that fall into category 1.  And they are ""issues"" because it sounds like haven't clearly defined what exactly they should be doing and what the criteria for success are for doing those things.    Maybe expand on exactly what your situation is in regards to the role and the employee in question not completing it.    There's not much more feedback that can be offered at this point."
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,papajohn56,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:00:01 2015 UTC,"Not talent but skill. Not everyone can do the work and there are guidelines to follow. They can do the job if they wanted to, but they don't follow the guidelines because they think I won't notice."
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,baskandpurr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:52:02 2015 UTC,"There are some phrases you use, ""uppity"", ""my help"", ""their superior"" that are way outside how I think about business relationships. I don't know if this language is a cause or effect of your problems, or perhaps both.  Your business sounds very different from mine, so maybe that is par for the course. And while my first reaction is that plenty of employees roll their eyes, I can understand that a young female could experience more of that.  It is hard to offer concrete advice. I suspect that somehow by trying to prove yourself (or feeling forced to prove yourself by the disrespect), you have made things worse. I'm not going to suggest that your try to ""be their friend"" etc, as you are the owner. But maybe this focusing on being treated as an owner should has distracted you from the real problem of your employees are not functioning effectively."

advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,rory096,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:31:36 2015 UTC,"Understood. However, given my particular situation it isn't working so well. I need to change some things, either the way they perceive me or set up guidelines before I hire them. One thing's for sure though, although I'm young I deserve respect because I'm their employer and I know what I'm talking about."
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,rory096,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:49:18 2015 UTC,"Your view here is the problem.  Just because you employ them doesn't mean they owe you any respect.  You owe each other mutual respect, and due to you seeing yourself as ""above"" them (clear from how you're talking), they're giving you back the same attitude - that you're a young snob.  FYI setting guidelines based on age is illegal."
advancedentrepreneur,3drunh,O_Cressida,-4,Mon Jul 20 04:10:54 2015 UTC,"Let me turn this around. I'm 45, I've been in the industry of my business since I was 20. I've worked all over the world, consulted, dealt with large and small teams, sacked teams, both rescued and killed million dollar projects etc. There is no way that you can have the same level of understanding as me. I don't care what your qualifications are or how much you make, those things mean almost nothing in practice.  So you wouldn't attempt to act like my boss, but if you did I could not take you seriously. If you were to explain your business in a realistic way and not attempt to place yourself in a postion of authority, or boast, that would be fine with me. But then I'm not insecure about status where other people may be.  Jobs are fundamentally about money. If you pay a person to do something, they will do it for the money. That doesn't mean they have to respect you, the only real control you have is that they want to be paid, they respect the money. As long as you understand the psychology it doesn't need to be a problem. If those people are so dismissive that it prevents them doing the job properly then don't pay."

There are so many people that want the job, these people should be happy it's given to them. Everyone thinks they're irreplaceable but they really aren't.

I would talk about your design, your manufacturing process, your material sourcing, your price point and how it works for retailers to make 40% margin so they have incentive to push your product, your distribution model, your barriers to market entry from competition, how you plan on acquiring new customers.  I worked at a company that was approached by VC and wanted to buy their competitor (us). They offered $1 million for everything and for the owner to work there for like 3 more years at current salary. It was a low-ball offer. The company had over $1 mil in inventory and over $2 mil in annual revenue with a growth rate for >200% annually in a pattern for 5 years+."

""I'm going on this rocket ride, does else anyone want to come along?"". Show them your vision and your plan to get there. The money stuff will happen by itself if they believe you.   since I was approached they already see the potential   No, don't assume that. VCs talk to pretty much everyone and anyone.

Also make sure you get OK terms when it comes to all the other clauses in the agreement (future investments, dilution, when you can exit, their control of the management, etc)"

The better, more time consuming thing to do would be to actually have several teams of people that would be ready to address the different problems and then quote people on how much it would be to produce the good they want.

Also it sounds like you're appealing to an untech savvy user base so your upsell needs to be simple. As in, ""Would you like fries with that?""  My first products first upsell feature was ""pick your own color"". Sometimes it's that simple depending on your product of course."
advancedentrepreneur,3ca1vi,roboticc,3,Mon Jul 6 09:12:34 2015 UTC,"We launched a similar service two years ago, eventually pivoting into a single vertical. The space is making a resurgence today with systems like Magic. Before that, we built the same system as a research project. These kinds of tools are powerful, attractive to users as a wish fulfillment mechanism and lightweight interactive AI, and provide a look into how good AI systems that come after Siri will help us get work done as they improve.  These kinds of systems have existed in India for many years (JustDial) and monetize via lead generation for conventional businesses. When someone searches for something like ""dry cleaners"", you sell that lead to dry cleaners locally.  You have two other options. One is to charge a subscription or per-task fee, which can be achieved simply by dropping a credit card link into your signup flow after your email address collector (or, alternately, by requesting it via email after the first successful task). The former is the Zirtual model; the latter is the Taskrabbit model. Watch your conversion rates through this funnel and you should see your business actually survive and thrive as not all users will choose to pay. This is the proper way to take advantage of your high first-step signup rates without killing yourself â you'll filter the users you can monetize.  The other option is to charge nothing unless someone carries out a business task or other category of task. For example, each time someone books a flight you could charge a 10% fee. That's the model planned for companies like http://viv.ai.  This is riskier for you as you need to support a larger volume of free users.  Drop me a note if you need additional help.  anand@leadgenius."

advancedentrepreneur,3ca1vi,CercaTrova6,3,Mon Jul 6 08:09:30 2015 UTC,"Give credit's. Tasks are credits and you can pay up front for any task.  You can buy a bulk sum of credits at a reduced rate, or a monthly subscription that gives you a supply and access to additional ones at a reduced rate.  You then use credits to pay for your services.   Give new users a limited and sustainable amount of credits, that's your cost to acquire a customer."

advancedentrepreneur,3ca1vi,thisdesignup,2,Mon Jul 6 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"Or, you know what you could do?

I think it's hard because you sit on a fine line between task-related services and random stuff people would want others to do but wouldn't actually pay for. Maybe try charging small amounts like $1 or $2 per task. May depend on how many tasks are being requested and how long the average task takes.
advancedentrepreneur,3ca1vi,bobvila2,2,Mon Jul 6 13:28:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. Small payments combined with a subscription tier would be quite good. You don't want to scare people away by forcing a subscription. I imagine many people will think ""I will only use this once or twice.""   Eventually though, if the service is good, people will find themselves using it more and more and see value in a subscription."

When you started this, what was your vision for how this would eventually make money?  Without understanding your original long term version it's hard to conceive an easy path forward without changing your service. You're basically claiming to do a lot of things that have to be done by hand for the whole world for free.  My advice would be to figure out one thing in your offering that is realistic to offer and that you can build a process around. Keep those people happy and try to raise funding to figure out a more refined service. Pay for everything out of pocket for now. Don't be afraid to change your offering, including your price. Work towards whatever your initial idea for how this would create revenue was, refine that idea and keep it moving. You've dug yourself a whole here but not really, it's way better than if 0 people signed up."
advancedentrepreneur,3ca1vi,wanderersushi,2,Mon Jul 6 11:51:37 2015 UTC,"Create a subscription based option where users pay X amount /month  This allows the user to ask multiple questions at the same time, faster answers (Get infront of the que etc).   I understand questions/tasks can't all be usefull to the general public but take all the relevant tasks and create a huge directory and allow subscribers to access it. (or this directory could be free and used to get more google pr/auth)  I honestly don't know what people ask you to do but I guess it all ranges from crazy shit to normal "" how many cows can i milk per day"" stuff. So an example for me would be ""Can you find the best rated hotel in Sweden, Stockholm""  Why not create partnerships with for instance booking.com and when a user asks for a hotell you give them the correct information with an affiliate link. (this can be expanded to anything consumer related without interfering with anything except your cash flow)  And lastly serve those answeres that you can with some sort of ad's close to them.  that is atleast where I would start."

Shutting it down was fucking retarded. Start it back up immediately! Too much traction is like too much money. If people were flooding your bank account with money, would you close your account because you didn't know what to do with it? That's what you just did. Traction is everything. How to manage it is a solvable problem. The best kind of problem.  I actually did something similar once and I deeply regret it. Hundreds of paying users per day were signing up to my site and I felt that was too many and the customer service was annoying, so I made it much harder to sign up and only accepted the highest paying customers. Fewer people signed up and I killed my growth. Brilliant! What I should have done was drop everything, work 100 hour weeks, hire people, provide amazing support and optimize everything to get as many customers as possible. If I had done that, there would be at least one more zero on my net worth today."

advancedentrepreneur,3c1ogw,montecarlo1,11,Fri Jul 3 23:04:33 2015 UTC,"I gave a timeline and set expectations. I said I would do this for X time. In that time, it will be really turbulent (financially, emotionally, physically, etc.) but at time X, we will evaluate together whether it makes sense as a family unit for me to continue to pursue this.   Since we are married, I don't believe it's fair for me to put our family ""at risk"" indefinitely but because I wanted to do this, I set parameters. If by time X, I'm not contributing Y to the family goals, then I need to change course. So far this has worked in that it bought me time but I consider my SO as a stakeholder to my business just like a VC or financial investor.   I think SO's really need to feel acknowledged and secured in someway which is challenging since entrepreneurship is not guaranteed so you have to address them like an investor. They need to be made aware (and reminded) of the risks, the upside, the timeline and when you'll pull the chute, if you need to (aka exit strategy). My SO and I have agreed to a timeline at which point we reassess (aka I get to pitch and buy myself more time or I get sold on why I should close shop and be an employee).  Protip: I bounce ideas off SO to get feedback/suggestions, especially when I'm stuck on something. I think this helps as a reminder that entrepreneurship is hard, there's no protocol or process document you can follow and likely no one to really turn to for guidance depending on how small your SMB/start-up is. SO gets this and as an added bonus, I get a new perspective to try an solve a problem.    To recap: 1. Set timelines. 2. Set expectations. 3. Explain the upside. 4. Explain the exit strategy.

You also wind up caving on points you would normally never have caved on if you weren't arguing with your SO.  All up our different skill sets have worked together to make our business what it is today but there are certainly times for both of us that we just wish the other would see things our way.  How long have you been working on the project with nothing significant to show for it?

For example on weekend, you spend 100% of your time with her for Saturday.  Sunday you work on your project.   During the week if you have 4 hours between getting home and going to sleep, you can tinker for half but you've got to give her some time.    And give yourself a little time NOT doing the project.   You risk getting burnout if 90% of your non-day-job time is spend focused on this project.  You seem to look down on your friends for being slaves to a job in the corporate world.

You haven't even taken any big risks yet. You haven't even had any major setbacks, had to put anything on the line or had any blowups with partners/clients/suppliers. Dude, if your biz has any legs at all, your SO is being difficult in the EASIEST stage of your biz. Take note and adjust appropriately, she will not take it well, and it will only get worse unless you have some crazy breakthrough and help her get it. My money is that she drops you the second it gets hard and risky. Probably the right move, she isn't cut out for this. That's fair, you need an incredibly solid foundation to build a biz with the support of your SO. Not everyone is built to be an entrepreneur or an entrepreneur's SO. Dealing with ambiguity, risk, disappointment, euphoria and more disappointment can take its toll on the strongest couple... That  doesn't seem to be you."

Friends who work the 9-5 kinda' resent your success, and some are embarrassed by their lack of effort in contrast to yours. It's sort of a ""I'm a failure for not trying"" subconscious thought. Not to mention, if you start pulling in decent money, you want to go out, you have money to spend, you can afford to waste a bit here and there, and people feel like they have to ""keep up"" with you.    It's not usually intentional, but the change in situation tends to cause people to slowly drift towards people closer to their level."

You should feel perfectly justified in whatever level of success you have. Age seems to matter most to people who have no other way of thinking that they have earned status.  It might help in social situations to think out a few of the things you do on a daily basis that would make for interesting discussion.  Think of it as an elevator pitch but you are just talking about a single element or two with the goal of talking about something interesting, not getting investment or sales.

advancedentrepreneur,3bkumd,Sendmoneyhere,4,Thu Jul 9 06:19:28 2015 UTC,"People don't actually look down on you. I think there are 4 main reasons why people around you react the way they do:  1. Theyâre not ready or willing to change Everything in our our external environment is a mirror of how we feel inside. This is because our belief systems (which we pick up at a very young age) flavor our perceptions of the world. Two people in the same room, at the same time, participating in the same conversation have two different experiences of how that went. When your loved ones see you making changes, it challenges their own resistance to that change. They are triggered by your commitment to yourself because they havenât been ready to make such a commitment. They chose the path of least resistance.  2. They donât want to lose their connection with you People may not realize this is whatâs happening for them. But say if their main way of relating to you is through work or hobbies, they might (subconsciously) feel that youâre slipping away. Or say your decision to go to the gym is interfering with pub time with your buddies. They may feel like they are no longer the top priority for you.  3. They may not understand you They donât know your thoughts, feelings, desires, and aspirations. We often fear what we donât understand.  I'm never talking about what I'm doing in family environments or around people who are not entrepreneurs, artists and other more open-minded people themselves. I make the conversation about them. I let them talk, which usually works fine. It's easier that way. I can understand them and relate to them because I've seen their world, they didn't see mine.   4. They mean well They mean well when they give you their advice. Maybe they tried to live their hopes and dreams (not hard enough), failed, gave up and stepped back in line. They want you to avoid the pain that comes with failure.  Saying people are malicious in their intents or just jealous, especially the ones around you who love you and care about you, is very unfair. I had to overcome these mechanics numerous times. When I decided to not go to university and find my own way of doing things. When I decided to quit a well paying job to start my own company. When I decided to become a vagabond, traveling the world indefinitely.  So ultimately the world is designed in a way that the people around you don't want you to change. You have to find ways to deal with it and become comfortable with the position you're in.  There are many books and essays that address the topics of people holding you back and the ""entrepreneurial loneliness"" that might come with it. A book that helped me quite a bit is How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World. Buddhist teachings and biographies of successful entrepreneurs contributed as well. So did surrounding myself with open-minded people like artists, writers, entrepreneurs and vagabonds."

advancedentrepreneur,3bkumd,acerldd,3,Tue Jun 30 11:30:56 2015 UTC,I had very similar experiences when I got back from studying abroad and then again later in life when I moved to a larger city while friends were still hanging out with the same people doing the same things in a smaller town. You've grown and you've had to do so rapidly to be successful as an entrepreneur.   They've stayed the same for years and the only things you now have in common are past experiences but you can't really engage in dialogue about the future. For my friends it comes down to sports and college bar experiences. Luckily I found friends who were growing with me along the way and then moved to another tech community that was really engaging. I'd suggest you meet new people and engage wth groups that appreciate your experiences.  For me meetups groups are awesome but you just need to find open minded people who have grown in some way like you.
advancedentrepreneur,3bkumd,chromiselda,3,Tue Jun 30 05:07:03 2015 UTC,"Ok, funny story time. I have a good friend who was an Executive VP at a fortune 50 company. He left that job and searched for a better option for a few months then took a job as the CEO of a sizable company.  Now, it is pretty normal for executives at that level to find a new job. Not only are there fewer jobs at this level they also take more time to evaluate multiple opportunities - and they can afford to be picky.  However, it was funny when a bunch of our mutual friends learned that he was ""jobless"". He got lots of unwanted pity till he started working again.  Moral of the story is that most people won't identify with what you do and will make incorrect assumptions. Let them. Just be yourself and do what makes sense to you."
advancedentrepreneur,3bkumd,RankFoundry,3,Tue Jun 30 20:10:56 2015 UTC,"My guess is it has to do with how you describe it. If you say ""I own my own business"" or "" I own a company that does XYZ"" you shouldn't get the response you indicated.  If you do, who cares? It took self confidence to strike out on your own - fall back on that self confidence rather than caring what others think.  If you use lofty non descriptive terms like ""I'm an entrepreneur"" people will just roll their eyes (and they should.)"

The reasonings are a little different, but maybe my insight from pre-college through working with coaches can help.   1) Small school coaches are much more likely to respond than big school coaches. Maybe start by reaching out to some of these in your area/target market. Email is by far the most reasonable way to get a response.   2) From what I've seen, most coaches have an assistant coach, if not several. These guys get fewer emails than the head coach, and they might be more likely to respond because they feel important by you asking them.   3) I'm on mobile, so I'm not sure how to see your post without starting over, but I think you mentioned you're currently a student trying to do this. Start at your school. Reach out to any student athletes you know first and ask them if they can put you in touch with their coach for an informational interview. Again, might have to settle for the assistant coach, but it's a start.   Let me know if you have any more questions about the inner workings of athletic departments, and hopefully I'll be able to provide some help."

advancedentrepreneur,3b4mw9,quockerwodger,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:32:45 2015 UTC,"Not really, for two reasons:   Usually the usage of these numbers is to track the effectiveness of different ads. So maybe a couple direct mailings are using different numbers, maybe some adwords ads, whatever else you have going on. You aren't putting a bunch of different numbers on your website unless it's on isolated landing pages. Google has no choice but to expect the NAP information for any given site to be all fucked up across the web, because it usually is.   Sooo many operations start out small and use a free skype or google voice number and either are unhappy with the service or outgrow it.  A lot of times these numbers have already been used for other businesses in the past and are published around on the scraper directories and never get fixed.  I work on a few sites that have had 2 or 3 addresses, and it's impossible to get everything straightened out everywhere when there are hundreds of these stupid sites out there.  In any given industry, google knows they are mostly garbage except for a couple, so you just google some keywords to find out what those are and make sure your NAP info is correct on those and after that it's rapidly diminishing returns so maybe you mess around with them when you have writer's block and just need a half hour break once in a while.  tl;dr: Google doesn't actually count that stuff as stringently as the companies selling it would have you believe."

advancedentrepreneur,3azumc,TheForgottenUser,4,Mon Jun 29 08:38:23 2015 UTC,"Learn how to best position yourself.  Successful people are often good at putting themselves in situations that give them the opportunities they are looking for. For instance - if you're trying to surround yourself with professional, mature individuals, you wouldn't want to go to a Reddit meetup or a WoW convention. Are there some successful people there? Maybe, but you'll be trying to find a unicorn. Try heading to a networking group near you, and doing things you'd expect successful people to do. You might try going to a Toastmasters club for instance.  If online networking is more to your liking, try to find forums and communities with like-minded individuals. Something like The Fastlane Forum is a good avenue to find people to surround yourself with if you are looking for other entrepreneurs.  As a final addendum, and don't take this personally as it may not be the case at all, remember to work on yourself first. Successful people don't want to hang around lazy, demotivating individuals. Make sure you are helping them as much as they are helping you - that's how relationships of any kind should work."

I feel as if I've capped all of my friends though. There's nothing to discuss with them as all they do is play games and eat (except for that one friend I mentioned). It's discouraging to come home to a dirty and lazy house and I'm tired of trying to inspire all of my friends, I want to be inspired instead.

A lot of those places are ""old boys clubs"" and are typically invite only but they have some of the most successful and smart people in a lot of industries. From there, you go and participate in events that you're interested in and get to know them on a personal level. Great place to bounce ideas off of each other and they aren't really THAT expensive (I think my club is about $150/mo in dues) for the amount of exposure you can get."

advancedentrepreneur,3b05dh,Toast42,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:13:03 2015 UTC,"Programmatic marketing, according to the what I've researched on-line, is a method of serving display ads using an algorithm.  One of our services is laser hair removal, which we have been doing for the past 5 years. We would take all of our demographic data that we have collected over the past five years and plug it into their platform. Their platform would, if we take their proposition at face value, serve those display ads to desktop/mobile/tablet users that are more likely to want a service like laser hair removal.   This is their website: www.geniusmonkey.com"

advancedentrepreneur,3b05dh,Smartare,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:18:39 2015 UTC,I suspect it might be very similar. It might be the same thing.
advancedentrepreneur,3b05dh,viveri,2,Sat Jul 4 20:06:24 2015 UTC,If that is what I think it is (they collect alot of information about people across the net and track them using cookies) and then they try to predict who will be interested in your product and serve them an ad. So kinda like retargeting but instead of using people who visited your website before they target people who visited other sites that indidcate an interest about your type of services (someone who have spent alot of time on blogs reading about hair removal services and lives in your area is probably more likekly to be interested than just a random websurfer). If it is this thing the key to their success is how big their database of tracked users and number of sites they track. If they for example track nothing in your area and your industry the data would be pretty worthless. But if they do it can be gold.

It seems like a good business model as organics is a huge business.   I exercise each morning, every night and still have time to be productive in all of my businesses. Similarly, you can meditate in the morning or at night and be productive toward your business during the day.  Here are a few tips you should do some research on:   Develop a workout/meditation schedule. Early in the morning/evening and stick to it, because it obviously makes you happy and it will release stress. Find solutions that can help you automate processes as much as possible. This can be an e-commerce back end, fulfillment center, shipping management software, manufacturing, packaging, emails. The list is endless of small or large things you can do to automate processes.

advancedentrepreneur,3aqq9o,TestEagleHQ,3,Mon Jun 22 19:09:45 2015 UTC,"This is the rest of the post :)  Â   The interview  Once youâve made contact with people, its time to set up the interview and start learning!  Â   Make the interview process as easy as possible  The easier you can make the process of attending the interview, the better the results will be. If setting up the meeting is a hassle, you will have more people will drop out and generally the interview won't be as informative as people will feel on edge. Because of this, I make sure that the process of being interviewed is as easy as possible.   To arrange a date and time for a meeting, I use an online scheduling service. These make it very easy to find a time when both of you are available without exchanging emails multiple times. You just enter your availability, send the details to the customer, they enter their availability and then you pick a time and date. There are a few sites out there that do this but I recommend Calendly, Doodle or needtomeet.  As for the call itself, video chat is great because seeing someone talk about a problem gives you a lot of non-verbal communication clues that you obviously can't get from a phone call. I also like video chat because itâs easy to tell when someone on video chat is distracted and you can get them back on track. There has been a lot of debate about whether Google Hangouts is better than Skype. The argument for Hangouts is that there is less for them to set up if they already have a Google/Gmail account. Iâm not convinced by that argument, instead I would offer people both options (and even Facetime too if that's what it takes to get them on a video chat).  If the customer will let you record the call, I would definitely do it. This lets you focus more on information gathering, rather than note taking, during the interview. If you can't record the call, you will have to gather information and analyze it to decide if you should make a note - all while the call is going on. If you explain what you only want to record the call so you don't have to take notes while you chat and that you will not share the video with anyone, most people are usually open to you recording it. There are a lot of screen recording apps but Camtasia and Screenflow are the ones that most people seem to use. If the customer does not want you to record the call, do not be tempted to record it anyway! This is a massive breach of trust and if word got out that you are doing this, it would be very difficult to persuade more people to interview with you.  Â   What to ask the customer  This is a topic that comes up a lot and to be honest, at first I struggled with it. Iâm not one of the worldâs natural conversationalists or an extrovert. You might think that this is a problem when it comes to customer interviews but remember - this is an interview, not a conversation. The difference is that a conversation is free-form and can go anywhere (or nowhere...), whereas an interview is structured and so its form can be set in advance. I did a lot of research into customer development questions and all the experts said the same thing - know what youâre going to ask before the interview starts. This allows you to make sure that you ask the right questions and make the most of your time. Of course, you may need to ask questions based on the customers responses, but you should know the questions that you must ask in advance. Once I figured this out, I set out to assemble the best list of questions possible. Mike Fishbein has a great post, with a huge list of customer interview questions. The questions below owe a lot to that post. (You should check out his customer development blog because the guy is an expert). Whether you use this list or create your own, the principles are still the same. You need to learn about the customer, their problems and what the customers think the solutions to those problems could be. You should also try to line the customer up as a beta user or early adopter.  The other key tactic I use is asking open-ended questions, instead of close-ended questions. Open-ended questions encourage full and meaningful answers and avoid leading the customer. They typically start with âHowâ, âWhyâ, âTell me aboutâ. Close-ended question are less objective and usually result in short, incomplete answers. A close-ended question might ask âDo you like your boss?â, whereas the open-ended question is âTell me about your bossâ.  Â   Learning about the customer  These questions help to confirm that the customer is in the market segment you are targeting; and they help you understand more about their role.    Tell me about your job.  How much time do you spend on [process you are improving]?   Â   Learning about their problems  These questions help you find out what the customers problems are, or validate your hypothesis about their problems.  Â   Problem Discovery    What are the top three challenges of your job?  Do you have processes for solving these challenges?  Which tasks take up most of your time?  Do you have a process for solving those tasks?  Is there a product or service that you wish existed?   Â   Problem Validation  If the customer doesn't talk about the problem you are interested in solving, you should ask these questions (otherwise, ignore them).     Do you find it hard to solve [the problem you are interested in]?  How motivated are you to solve this problem?  Whatâs the hardest part about [process youâre improving]?  Tell me about the last time you solved [the problem you are interested in].  How important is [the value that you are delivering] to you?  What would fixing [the problem you are interested in] mean to you?   Â   Discovering solutions  These questions can help you discover solutions to problems. They also help you identify problems with your competitorsâ products, which can become part of your solution.    What do you think could be done to help you with [the problem you are interested in]?  What would be your ideal solution to [the problem you are interested in]?  What would that let you do?  What are you currently doing to solve [the problem you are interested in]?  What else have you tried?  What do you think of the products you are using to solve [the problem you are interested in]?  Have you seen any other products that could solve [the problem you are interested in]?   Â   Ending the interview  I use these questions to make sure I understood the customers main problems and to see if the customer might want to become a beta user/early adopter.    So based on the conversation, it sounds like [the problems they mention] is really difficult for you, but [any potential problems that they did not mention] is not. How accurate is that?  Is there anything you think I should know but didnât ask about?  Do you know anyone else who might also have this problem that I could talk to?  Can I keep you in the loop on how the product develops?  Can I follow up with you if I have more questions?   Â   Interview tips  Here are a few tips that you can use to get the most from your interviews.     Don't tell the customer why you are conducting the interviews as this can lead to bias in their answers. Instead say âIâm working on a project and would like to ask you some questionsâ.   Interviewing enough customers will take longer than you think. But don't be tempted to rush the process by interviewing anyone who happens to express an interest. If you do this, your data may be skewed and you won't learn the right lessons. Only interview people who you genuinely think would buy the product.    Don't ask if people would buy your product, you wonât get an accurate answer. People will be too polite to tell you that they wouldnât buy it. The only accurate way to know if people would buy a product is to give them an opportunity to do so and measure what happens.   At the end of each section and the end of the interview, summarize what you think you heard and ask them to confirm that you are correct. This ensures that you understand what the customer is saying. And it shows the customer that you are listening, which will encourage them to keep being open.   If a customer asks if you are going to add a feature, don't say yes (even if you are). Answering yes stops the conversation dead in its tracks without you learning as much as you could. Instead, ask them if thatâs important to them and ask what they would expect the feature to do.   After you ask a question, stop talking. People have a natural need to fill an empty space in a conversation. If you ask a question and then stop talking, the customer will feel obligated to answer.   Remember this is an interview, not a conversation, so follow your script. If you go off-script, or your customer strays from your questions, try to get the interview back on track as quickly as possible.   Email the customer after the interview and thank them for their time, even if it went badly or they don't want to be a beta user. Itâs the polite thing to do and it may persuade the customer to share more information."

I think I know what it is., but still not sure. You should have a large heading that explains what the product is and the value it adds. Explain it to a 5 year old.   People spend billions on their pets every year so you have a huge market. Now you need to differentiate yourself from what I can get at Walmart or pet smart.  I'm not sure why I would buy your stuff over a tag from them. This leads me back to not understanding your value proposition.  Be clear and concise. Straight up define for me. As a potential consumer I don't want to derive it myself. You tell me. I'll say yes or no if it's a fit by voting with my wallet.

You mention a cat but I didn't see a cat on the page it was mentioned.  Make one for a horse so people get that it can be for many types of pets.

Since we read differently than we speak, my mind got caught on ""Made in Canada from nothing.."" Why does this page only have one picture of food? The bags are nice, but if you look at pretty much any dog treat bag in the Pet Store, you can see what the treat looks like. ""Most popular collection"" shows 5 bags, but no quantity, no pictures of what the food looks like, no ingredients, etc. Take the food out of the bag and show me exactly what I'm buying.  Yeti Cheese How big is this? Maybe it's too big for my small dog or too small for my big dog. Take a picture with a dog chewing on it, so I can at least get an idea of the size.  If I have a big dog, I'm going to need big dog treats. I can't figure out which ones I need to order from here.  No ingredients other than Canadian duck, Canadian chicken, and Canadian beef - no preservatives, dyes, fragrances, chemicals, grains or any other crap. What about renaming that to something a little funnier but direct.. like, ""Patriotic Duck, Chicken, and Beef- nothing foreign or unwanted here!""  Can you move the ""View prices in: CAD / USD"" to the top? It took me waaaay too long to find it.  You gotta add a ""10% off with first order by signing up to our newsletter!"" type deal.

Treats / Chews / Heath - If the whole site is about healthy stuff, then why have a separate section? Maybe rename it to (not cremes.. but idk.. maybe something else?).

In the catalog the visual weight is off (heavier on the left) and it is jarring...also the images do not line up.  Actually its left heavy on every page.  Visual balance is important.  Generally your color scheme does not work with your product (IMO).  One of your main images (the rotating ones) has icons for twitter/FB/etc... but they are unclickable.  There is no link back to home on your nav bar.  It is difficult to read the graphic on your about page...maybe impossible on mobile.  Your search field works, but the input text comes out in white...which you can't see against a white backdrop.  Your FB page is better but your banner image is grainy.

It end up shredding the first build apart. The second build - the owners son was put in charge of - he had a different vision than his dad. The criteria was redefined on the fly after hours of brainstorming.  Needless to say were now on the third build, even with preapproved walkthroughs and all that, its very difficult for people to see it without putting their own mileage in it.

We build custom solutions or integration packages.   Yes, there are tons of opportunities to build software for these companies however they are not SaaS-happy. They like their software in their own data centers and will rarely release their trading data outside their firewalls. So the first thing that needs to happen is you need to find a way to perform and maintain multiple on site deployments in a way that doesn't cause you to branch-per-client, like most of the software companies do in this space.   But here is the kicker - most of my clients don't think about outsourcing their activities that aren't core competencies. They still run their billing, CRM (with the exception to Salesforce), risk, pricing, credit, most of their infrastructure in-house. None of these things make them a better energy company and they all do fundamentally the same things, but the implementations could range from home-grown power builder apps that are 25 years old all the way to 80 million dollar Oracle utilities installs."

advancedentrepreneur,39pj1a,dartamoninc,3,Sat Jun 13 18:57:41 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, I only have experience with very large companies so the small/medium guys may be different. Most of the time, it's treated like a staffing exercise. They will put out RFQs to preferred vendors for smaller projects < 200k, for small teams - like a PM, 2 devs and a BA. For those gigs, you pretty much have to be on their preferred vendors list, already have an executed MSA, and be ready to staff up in less than a month - rarely can you hit the street for talent to augment unless you have a really good network.   Anything larger than that, they will put out RFPs and now you have to be on the list to even get those, write up a full proposal and usually do 3-4 presentations and rounds through to get awarded the work. Again, need an MSA in place prior to executing SOWs for any work. And if you are competing against guys like us, you probably need to staff up pretty quick with developers who have domain experience. All of our guys aren't just PMs or devs or BAs.  They could probably get jobs in the ops side as a functional manager pretty easily with the level of domain knowledge.   If I were to do what you were doing, I would look to get just a staffing role on a project or two, and build a reputation. Then use that rep to work through MSA, getting in the line for smaller projects. Then execute and give them more than they expect and overwhelm them with customer service. Most of the shops will feed you as much business as you can handle if you can execute.   That help?"

Ask them if there is another way of solving the problem. The beauty of coding is that there is always more than one way to solve a problem. Any developer worth it's salt should understand this and be able to at least come up with a several approaches to solve the problem.

And it doesn't take a lot of effort to find the blades and order them in bulk for super cheap. DSC shouldn't drop their prices and start a race to the bottom. They would lose that battle.

Now, they still seem like that, but instead of being long shot underdogs, they seem like equals in competition.

Gillette claims it's cheaper than DSC, when Gillette sends one razor per month vs 4 for DSC. Gillette tries to justify that its studies show that their blades last a month. But they never proved that a DSC razor only lasts a week.   So not only did they attempt to erode their position as the best razor on the market in favor of best value razor. They also diluted its effectiveness by making unsubstantiated claims with so many asterisks it tips off a customer not to believe everything so quickly."

Im not particularly familiar with the range of services DSC offers (I have a beard and don't shave often so I don't utilize their services) but have heard of the company. I'd look into what other personal hygiene products they could offer using the already established subscription based business model. Additionally I'd look into manufacturing my own DSC branded razors (assuming they don't do this already) to try and capture additional margin. That way they could compete on price with Gillette if they had to.

I would work on content that compares DSC to Gillette's program. I'd do it in an irreverent style that is consistent with the DSC brand and appeals to the type of customer that I have already had success attracting.

I will do a cost benefit analysis on large purchases or recurring ones. I did one for my safety razor and I plotted the cost savings over time based on the 400 blades I bought at 30 cents a piece. 400 blades is approximately 35 years of use.

advancedentrepreneur,398uzz,ryanakron,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"The thing about having an official board of advisors, is it doesn't make sense to have one unless you are already off the ground and doing at least decently well. And by the time that happens, your company should be of significant value that a small equity option (<1%) is genuinely valuable.   This is just my opinion, but I really, really hate the idea of having a formal board. For a small or mid-size company, I just don't see the value. If you need mentorship, then make connections with established people in your industry and if their mentorship results in profit, then compensate them accordingly with money.  Good luck!"
advancedentrepreneur,398uzz,justacitizen2460,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:23:41 2015 UTC,"First off, an advisory board is or should be a value added asset to your business. A board of Director's is a whole different can of worms. I strongly suggest an advisory board as a means of growing your business. An advisor is different than a mentor. You need to pick advisor's that can obviously bring something to your business, whether that is a particular skill set you are lacking organizationally or there is a synergistic benefit from having that person involved,i.e. , a person who can connect you to potential customers within your industry etc. The advisor's value and equity percentage should be directly related to what direct/measurable impact they bring to your business. At the very least they should bring a different perspective to your thoughts and actions about running your business, and hopefully they can help you become more profitable through either adding their business or coming up with strategies and connections that you normally wouldn't be able to accomplish yourself. These are all measurable actions, so you can then put a value to each advisor. So basically, the equity/options you make available should be a percentage you are comfortable with, and then you should award those options according to what impact they make to improve your business.  I have personally been in situations where I was an advisor. I was directly rewarded with x amount of either compensation or equity based on the amount of increased profitability and sales I have brought into a business. You must determine what your advisory board's direct purpose will be. Then what you are comfortable with, as far as offering equity/options/compensation. You should then develop a formula based on the criteria of the functions, so there is a plan in place, and everyone understands it."

advancedentrepreneur,393fxk,RemindMeBot,3,Thu Jun 11 02:15:24 2015 UTC,"I'll preface this by saying it all depends ... are you licensing a product design for a physical product to a large company who make 1000s of these agreements each year, or a software product to a small company that is doing this for the first time? Is your product design included in something larger, or is it the entirety of what will be sold? Some more info may help people to offer advice.  Some general comments though:   I feel it's reasonable for there to be a limit on how long you will be compensated for your IP. Patents expire, etc. I'd expect the timeframe to be negotiable.  Is 5% reasonable for the industry? If you're expecting the product volume to increase over time then maybe ask for 4% over 12 years or if it is going to decrease then 9% over 5 years Is it an exclusive license? That is, can you sell licenses to other people? What happens if they never sell a single product? If this is exclusive then you'll never see a dollar. If this is the case then some annual minimum may be appropriate. Do you need a per product minimum - ""5% or $xxx per product, whichever is higher""? This would prevent them giving your piece away cheaply and making their money on some other piece of the product. Again - it depends on what you're selling. Do you own the product name after the 10 years? Are there up-front costs for you? If so, is some initial payment reasonable? What happens if they go out of business or are acquired? Who is responsible if there is a defect in the design or it infringes on a patent? Do you need to carry insurance for this?   If this is for a reasonable amount of money then you need a lawyer - this gets very complex."

advancedentrepreneur,393fxk,V-007,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:05:44 2015 UTC,It seems strange to me that I should grant them more than a lifetime of rights to produce my intellectual property but only expect to be compensated for that property for 10 years.   That is correct.    Is this a normal/reasonable term for this type of contract? Should I have expected this? Do I have room to negotiate?   I think this is totally dependent on the individual situation for the specific deal.   One other thing to be on the look out for: If they get the rights to any derivable products you make from it. Like if you make a similar or a verision 2.

If you're mass manufacturing outside of a bench scale prototypes, you probably need more money. Alternative to raising capital in exchange for equity, you can consider bank loans but this comes with certain risk. I've seen capital lease deals get hardware built and in the market to some success. Know that purchase orders can be used as powerful leverage with banks and low interest loan funds. In the end, I see a hardware companies ability to execute comes down to starting cash position, R&D, production costs, distribution, operations, and marketing/sales. If these can be supported with little to no money, you maybe onto a good business."

This is a reboot of our original company targeting the same industry with a different hardware b2b product.  We previously solved done difficult problems and earned some patents, but couldn't get true market traction.  We convinced our investors to give us more money to pivot, and so far it's been really good.  We kept the same team and hit the ground running.

advancedentrepreneur,3939oo,sachbl,-5,Fri Jul 3 23:07:25 2015 UTC,"You question of being able to bootstrap is directly correlated to the amount of money you have to spend. Obviously, if have a ton of money it is possible. Ill explain my story. I put in $10k, my cofounder put in $15k. Following year we raised $100k, we are now in the process of raising another $100k. We expect to need another $800k to get to market.   I had a sit down with the co-founder of fitbit. They raised $400k first, then 2MM just to get to market.  So yeah, if you have a million laying around, sure you could bootstrap it. However, let me tell you, if you think people are going to work for free with the hope of someday getting paid, you're going to have a bad time.   edit: I quit my job may 13' to pressure this full time. I haven't had a paycheck in two years.   For additional reference, our CM Jabil, invested $50k of in-kind services as well. Money just is so easy to spend in the hardware world.

But - having said that - generally speaking you want to optimize first for the customer experience and then operations of the systems/employees. At the end of the day, combating any gaming of the system based on currency differences should be advised if it negatively affects the buying experience.

This can't possibly give you any valuable insights into anything, especially if you are complete noobs in PPC and SEO.   ""Gave up"" is another red flag when used by ""entrepreneurs"".

advancedentrepreneur,38zw90,PsychMarketing,4,Tue Jun 9 17:21:58 2015 UTC,"ooooo yeah - so going through your site - it's really really rough.  It looks like it was thrown together - the one important aspect of ecommerce (when you're not just providing affiliate links), is that the buyer has to feel like they can trust the seller - and the only impression they get is your website.    If your website looks like a used car salesman - well... you know where that's going.  It honestly just really looks like it was thrown together, trying to make a couple of bucks.    Regarding your $100 in spend - You can't really judge that at all - especially on high ticket items.  $100 spend for a $699 item - I mean you basically have to convert one sale to make up the cost of your ad spend.  If you're looking at a 10% close rate, on a 10% conversion rate - you're going to need 100 clicks, for 10% conversion, for 10% sale close.  Which means, I hope your ads were costing you $1 or less per click.  If not, then there is no way you spent enough to see any results.  What other information do you have regarding the behavior of the people after the clicked - and are we talking about 20 people? (which is my guess).    Does your ad copy have buyer intent in it? Is the person clicking on it looking to buy your specific product, or was the ad copy click baiting?  Even still - at the end of the day - the site just doesn't instill a lot of trust - and you're asking me to part with $300+ dollars, and I don't know who you are.  You could take my money, spend 3 weeks shipping it, have it arrive broken, and I'd never hear from you again.  No idea.  Good luck!  Everyone has to start somewhere - if you're serious about doing this, you have your work cut out for you.  One final suggestion - since you want this to be a part time ordeal - cut down on your inventory by like 90% - focus on selling ONE thing - whether it's an adjustable monitor stand, or an accessory, or one type of desk.  Sell the crap out of that item, and do it well.  Once you've figured that out - then add some more.   Nothing wrong with this approach - and if you can't sell that single item as a standalone - then you probably shouldn't be selling it anyways.  Build blog posts, reviews, articles around why that item is better than anything else like it.  And go from there - I see a lot of grasping at different straws, hoping something sticks - which again, isn't a bad idea if you have the budget and knowledge for it - and then once you see what sticks, dropping the crappy products and throwing your budget into the high sellers."

advancedentrepreneur,38q5kf,roboticc,16,Sat Jun 6 01:33:39 2015 UTC,"How did the PE firm approach you?  We hired an M&A bank to reach out to a small group of them, because we wanted a competitive process (PE firms bidding against one another). We were a very attractive company to buy at a time when there is more money to invest than there are good things to invest in. Like selling a house in a hot housing market...we had a number of interested buyers.  How long did the transaction take? We made sure our ""house was in order"" (audits, etc) and wrote up a marketing document (often referred to as a CIM (confidential information memorandum) over the course of about 2 months. Then came initial conversations and day-long sessions with a number of firms which was another month. After that was lots of diligence by the most serious potential buyers for another month or so. Once the purchase agreement was signed it was about 4 weeks until funds came through and the deal was closed. All in all, about 6 months.  How have they been doing since? Overall, things have been OK...but not great. We were growing very quickly and the change of ownership brought some disruptions. Like hitting a pothole when you're speeding. Growth has slowed, but is still healthy.   What role do you have now?Hindsight is 20/20...was it worth it? What do you do now? The transaction was about 2 years ago. I stayed on for about a year, then (for a lot of reasons) I decided it was time for me to go. I have recently (like over the past couple of months) gotten re-engaged with the business and am spending 2 days a week there working on strategic initiatives. In addition to that, I am advising a couple of small businesses and spending some time in the non-profit world.  Financially it was definitely worth it...but that's not really what you asking, I think. It's a mixed bag. I miss our old company and have come to terms with the fact that it's not ours anymore. Life with money is much easier, but it's not the cure-all that it seems like it will be before one has it."

advancedentrepreneur,38q5kf,alystair,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:23:44 2015 UTC,How many points did the M&A bank take from the sale (or did they work for a set fee)?
advancedentrepreneur,38q5kf,Hallucinaut,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:09:58 2015 UTC,"It was a percentage of the sale price that stepped up at different levels. X % of the first $200MM, Y% of $200-250, Z% of $250-300, etc.   This ensured that if they were helpful (or lucky) in getting a top price, they made a lot...and if the value was less than we thought it would be at the outset, they made very little.   When all was said and done, they made about 3% and it was a huge fee for them - more than they make on most deals. We had some negotiator's remorse on how we set up the structure with them."
advancedentrepreneur,38q5kf,Hallucinaut,2,Wed Jun 10 13:11:54 2015 UTC,"Feel free to give an approximate range here if you don't want to share exact figures:  1) What valuation did you have at exit?  2) Did you raise capital beforehand, and what was your ownership stake at exit?  3) Will you do it again (ie, start a start-up)?  4) Hardest part of the journey to $130MM?"
advancedentrepreneur,38q5kf,bruceleezard,8,Sat Jun 6 03:37:46 2015 UTC,"1) What valuation did you have at exit?  Value was about $300MM  2) Did you raise capital beforehand, and what was your ownership stake at exit?  The majority owner put about $5MM into the business. He had deep pockets, so we didn't have to raise capital from outside sources. We were able to pay him back, with interest after about 4 years. Since he took so much financial risk, he owned the vast majority of the company. I had about 4%.  3) Will you do it again (ie, start a start-up)? I honestly don't know. I like being around them (I advise a couple of early-stage companies), but I'm not sure I want to be back in that beehive for 60 hours a week.   4) Hardest part of the journey to $130MM? That's a hard question. There were so many surprises, setbacks and worries along the way. But when I think of the REALLY big challenges, they always involve people:   Hiring good people, and understanding that interviewing is a really important process. Having the discipline to let people go, when needed. Building a good culture and protecting it. Getting teams to collaborate...  ...I could keep the list going for a while. The more we grew, the more people we needed. Adding people was like adding ingredients to a recipe. It got harder and harder to avoid messing up the meal."

We're managing change - from a mom/pops type management to a true small business (me as CEO with mgmt team).   It has been ROUGH from a people perspective.    What was the tough part of the people?  How long did it take to change the culture?  Did it ever end or just get easier (with better onboarding, training, succession planning)?"
advancedentrepreneur,38q5kf,prillin101,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:45:47 2015 UTC,"From my point of view, the culture thing is never finished. In some ways it gets harder as you grow...in other ways it can become automatic if your regular activities reinforce your desired culture. It's not about a once-a-year team-building-via-ropes-course-and-trust-fall activity.  Here's my advice, not knowing the details of what you're facing:   You're at the front end of some big change - that calls for good communication. I think there are a few things that help make this happen.   Setting up routines. You should have 1:1 time with each of your direct reports. It doesn't have to be a set time each day or week, but it does have to be a deliberate effort. The same goes for the team as a whole. Basically, try to create the times and places to make information flow freely.  Sharing quality information. If you are honest and direct, others will follow that lead. Compliment people publicly when they provide good information or insight. Coach people privately when they need help.  Building trust. Basically, trust is the oil in the management communication machine. As the CEO, you can do a lot to build an environment that helps people trust one another. For example, you have an opportunity to establish a culture where failure, when accompanied by good intentions and effort, is OK. Hell, it's almost as good as success (at least you know what DOESN'T work now). You can acknowledge what you suck at and have others do the same. You can share personal history with each other and make it a priority to treat each other with respect, calling people out when they don't. If you have kids, you'll recognize that this sounds like parenting advice. That's not really surprising when you think about how much trust exists in families. A team member that trusts and feels trusted is going to be much more likely to tell you what they think and what they need. They will ask for help when they're in over their heads...and offer help when they see where it's needed.   These three things work together to drive, high-quality information being shared on a regular basis without a lot of bullshit.  One other thought: As the company grows, and you add more employees, your management team may begin to feel that the group they lead is their ""team"". Push back on this. Their first team is the management team. You can help reinforce this by celebrating team wins, not individual player stats. The ugliest corporate politics that I have seen exist when people are looking out for the groups they lead rather than the company (which is really represented by the management team).  Finally, here's a book recommendation. It's short, entertaining and powerful. After you read it, you may want all of the members of your management team to read it as well.  Five Dysfunctions of a Team - http://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433771484&sr=1-2&keywords=five+dysfunctions+of+a+team  Good luck and feel free to PM me if you have a specific situation that you'd like to discuss."

advancedentrepreneur,38q5kf,Lucretian,2,Sat Jun 6 09:46:20 2015 UTC,"Now I understand...I was reading that as a verb: to overrun.   To be honest, it felt like selling the business was something that we wanted to do WITH the business...the same way that opening a second warehouse or introducing a new line of products did. It didn't feel like it was going to be the end of something. In hindsight, I can see how silly a feeling that was - like selling your house is part of renovating it.   I wasn't personally over it as we approached the transaction...but I did grow tired of it VERY soon after the sale. It just became a thing we did with the business that couldn't be undone (unlike opening a second warehouse or introducing a new line of products).  Hope that makes some sense."

Focus copy on pain points and shorten it.  You want people to know almost immediately what Ivacy does so they don't bounce.  In terms of increasing followers on your social pages you might try participating in discussions on current events on major news sites with a username that is Ivacy Privacy Management or something like that.  This may help to drive some to your sites out of curiosity if you provide good content.  Lastly posting articles and white papers that provide details on some of the research that Ivacy has done in the sector on LinkedIn group pages can drive traffic as well.  Just my two cents.

I would go to those reviews, offer a demo/free copy (I am assuming you are selling th software not actual hardware like a Cisco ASA). See if you can get included in those, and get link backs to your site. (Helps with SEO!).   Also, does your VPN service have any differentiators? You want to focus on those of you do.   I would suggest adding a blog to your website and focus posts on long tail keywords. Most people search for more than 2 words. Use google keyword planner to figure those out and start blogging. Eventually look into Adwords and such for those same long tail keywords."

You need to either get them asking questions about it or excited about the possibilities. Try and develop inforgraphics that break down a VPN for the layperson and put them on pintrest. Have a human interest story on your facebook. Have conversations without it being a direct product ad. People like to buy from people and the more human you seem the more your community will grow."

You may want a simple motivational meeting where you can provide some clarity on this and provide some recommendations. We've found that leaning a little more casual / interesting in the job posting as opposed to formal and stiff gets much more attention these days.

No threats but maybe get their imaginations going, or just do it yourself and then make them feel ashamed you just did your job and their job?  Edit: I would just like to throw in I am not the biggest fan of incentives in the traditional sense as a contract has been formed around the employee doing their job at a given compensation.  But when it's obvious someone has gone above and beyond in their duties an ample ""thank you"" (aka cash/meal/etc) may be in order.

Low end entry job places go to job fairs. Everyone goes to trade shows.

As far as a personal morning routine, it took a LONG time to really tweak what works for me, and I think that's the main takeaway here-- you can gather ideas from other peoples' morning routines, but that should just be a starting point to come up with ideas to test on yourself-- everyone is different.  My most popular blog post of all time (http://capitolstartup.com/blog/my-morning-routine-for-energy-and-productivity-meditation-water-and-fasted-workouts/) actually goes through my morning routine, and why I do each part of it.

advancedentrepreneur,38nqli,stephensteinberg88,2,Fri Jun 5 19:53:54 2015 UTC,"Well, I have several journals - some reviewed more intensely than others.  I keep a Five Minute Journal, which I write in both upon waking and before bed. There's essentially a natural ""review"" process built into this journal on a daily basis, where you reflect upon your day before going to bed. Beyond that, there's no review process - since the main benefit of this journal is mindfulness.  I also keep a more free form journal which I review sporadically. This journal mostly serves as an idea dump, and helps ease the process of brainstorming. I comb over this journal roughly once a week, reflecting on ideas I had throughout the week. Although they're mostly shit, there are several that have acted as the foundation for more refined ideas. It's extremely helpful just to get everything ""out"" so that you're able to analyze it in more detail later and critique those ideas from a fresh perspective.  I also keep a ""relationship journal"" with my partner. This is a creation of my own, but the format is similar to that of the Five Minute Journal. We both keep journals and write in them on a daily basis, at night before bed. We have a weekly reflection session with one another and it serves to help us grow, both as partners and individuals. It might seem cheesy and scripted, but it's really helpful - especially as a busy entrepreneur who sometimes has to make sacrifices in the ""relationship"" department, and as an introvert who sometimes has trouble relating to and bonding with others."

I go to bed between 11pm-1am most nights, depending on what the day has presented, and what's on tap for the next day.   I recently injured my calf while running, so working out has slowed down (no excuse), but I bike into work in the AM (short ride of about 4km).   I usually down a protein shake at home, or have breakfast at the office (usually in the form of a ham sandwich).   That's it. Nothing incredible or spiritual."
advancedentrepreneur,38nqli,TOCalling,2,Fri Jun 5 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"I have a ""routine"" but it doesn't happen every single day. I have a toddler, a full time job and trying be an entrepreneur at the same time so it just doesn't seem to work out for me every day. I will say, when I do my routine it truly does make a difference. Not just in my productivity but also my emotional level for the day. I don't feel stressed out or get that feeling like I forgot to do something. I guess because it's the only part of my day that feels organized.  Anyway my routine when I do it goes something like this:   Wake up, immediately drink a large mason jar full of purified lemon water. Better than an energy drink! Step outside the backporch and enjoy some early morning sun while my doggie does his business. Head to the computer and before I do anything I check my inbox. This usually tells me what kind of day I'm going to have. Easy and calm or crazy and chaotic. So I just like to get it out of the way first. After that, I head into my social media management software. My business is a small social media and online marketing agency and I use a piece of software called SproutSocial. There's a little message tab on there that let's me see at a glance everything that has come in for each of my clients...like people who followed, messages, etc. So I handle up on all of those messages first thing in the morning. I also do it a couple times during the day, but morning is the big push because overnight is super busy in the social media world. After handling my social media business, I answer any outstanding emails that came in while I was doing that. Lastly, I grab myself a cup of coffee and sit down to read industry news through Feedly to keep my brain going strong. Helps to keep me current with what's going on, new technologies and happenings, etc.   From there, it's just a normal business day.  All of that takes me about an hour and a half.

advancedentrepreneur,37ep6o,travellar,2,Wed May 27 02:24:42 2015 UTC,"So the sampling needs to be done from Dubai. The time lag between Dubai-India would be about 7-10 days or so.  For China it would be 10-12 days. I am also thinking about trying Bangladesh, but the reliability is considerably lower. And QC again would be all but lost. Sampling must be pristine.   Promptness of sampling is vital. Once an inquiry is received the sampling needs to be done within 2-3 days. Order confirmation in 7 days for target revenue to be achieved. Low-cost manufacturing also means smaller margins since we are in market penetration mode right now."

There is a constant logjam with outsourcing and needs constant attention and follow up. India sometimes is not able to offer that. Our offices in China are more efficient.   HM"
advancedentrepreneur,37ep6o,bapakkau_pirate,2,Wed May 27 03:05:07 2015 UTC,"I think you're making an assumption here that because your existing outsourcers are not meeting expectations, that you will be unable to find outsourcers in the near future who perform at the level you require. I want to challenge that assumption.  Setting up a manufacturing facility is a significant investment in capital, as your board expressed in their concern, and more importantly will be a significant drain on the time & attention of your executive staff while you are finding a location, building out, hiring staff, and developing all the training and procedures to meet your own standards for the work.  What do you think it would cost you to hire a reputable consulting firm to solve the quality problems for you, by seeking out reliable suppliers and developing procedures that ensure your quality standards and timelines are met?  If you get good outsourcers onboard and are not putting all that capital (money, time, and attention) into building out your own facility, what else could you invest that into? (Sales and marketing would be my suggestion!)  Building your own manufacturing capability in house will give you more direct control, but is it worth the opportunity costs?"
advancedentrepreneur,37ep6o,bwb,1 point,Wed May 27 02:49:19 2015 UTC,"That is the exact concern my board has. Great job.  So I am setting up BDM's for each target sector. We start another one in 10-15 days, and are making some hires for that now.   Labor cost is fairly cheap. And you are right about finding the right outsourcing partners.   But do you not feel that having absolute control over the manufacturing process is worth the investment?   And what about after sales/after delivery services. Even if we assume a 5% defection rate (1-5% is fairly common). Do you think it would still be cost-effective to outsource? Would it not be better if we had the manufacturing facility to ourselves and could control the rejection rates, or use TQM to catch them at source? In order to offer better quality services, we are thinking about offering a 15-day replacement-at-no-extra-cost policy. This would help us catch the larger competitors off-guard and keep the larger clients happy.   What do you think?  HM"
advancedentrepreneur,37ep6o,steenwear,2,Wed May 27 03:02:04 2015 UTC,"what are your sales like?   from my perspective, if you already have a China office, it might be more efficient to hire a consultant that can do regular inspections on your outsourced partners to ensure QC is maintained. If not, there's always the option of finding better outsourced manufacturers.  secondly, i understand the concerns about sampling. what might be a good idea is to invest in a small local warehouse/factory that can do two things, hold inventory and produce samples.   I've worked with companies that holds generic inventory for uniforms(like different colors for instance) and have their local small factory fulfill the customization orders, be it printing or embroidery. that works for smaller orders like 20k as you mentioned. but for bigger orders, I'd stick to outsourcing after producing a sample locally."
advancedentrepreneur,37ep6o,baat,1 point,Wed May 27 06:19:55 2015 UTC,"It must be very frustrating to you to be so close to winning a deal and then to lose it because your suppliers did a poor job and you had no control over it.  In my business, I often worry that outsourcers might sometimes fail to do a quality job on the services that I sell, but ultimately I have to accept the economics of the situation that say that it is acceptable to take the risk of sometimes losing a client because of an outsourcer screw-up, because using outsourcers means that my business has capabilities that I could not afford to build in-house (and if I could, it would not be the highest leverage place to invest the cash.)  Do you think you could find suppliers who are already using TQM? Surely they must exist somewhere and there must be consultants who know how to find them.  Offering a replacement guarantee sounds really good especially if your competitors are not offering that... takes risk away from the client and places it on you instead, which the client should like. As you improve your production quality, the guarantee will cost you less and less over time, but you keep all the sales benefits.  Looking at the trade-offs of using imperfect outsourcers, you should model both the pre-sales and post-sales scenarios:  What is your sales conversion rate if you outsource samples and they are late or wrong 2.5% of the time? What is your sales conversion rate if the samples are made in-house and wrong only 0.5% of the time?   What is your average profit on a sale if you outsource production and have to replace 5% defective units? What is your average profit per sale if you manufacture in-house and have only 1% defective units?  Even if outsourcing is 1.5x, 2x, or 5x worse than in-house, do you still grow faster if you invest in sales & marketing instead of building a factory?   Instead of implementing continuous improvement in your own factories, can you implement a program of continuously seeking out higher-quality outsourcers? Could you send most of an order to your existing best supplier and a small part of the order to a new supplier, and see who produces the best results based on cost, delivery time, and defect rate?  If your current suppliers know that they are always competing for your business, hopefully they will be motivated to keep improving!  From a purely financial perspective, I think it is almost certain that finding high-quality outsourcers will make you more money in the short-term. Over the long-term it will depend on just how much you gain from in-house manufacturing by reducing COGS and increasing sales conversion rates with tighter cost control and quality control, and also on how much you wind up losing from being over-capacity or under-capacity at your facilities as the business grows.  Most business leaders don't fully consider the cost of dividing management's attention across multiple initiatives, when they should be focused on one thing that will move them toward the main strategic goal. You always need to think like an investor. You have a certain amount of cash and only a certain amount of brainpower you can apply to problems. During the rapid growth phase of a business, the best ROI typically comes from applying the brainpower to building sales systems, finding the highest-performing sales & marketing channels, and investing your cash there to bring in more deals.  When growth slows down, or you have more cash than you can effectively invest in growing sales, or your operations problems start to present a better investment opportunity than sales does, that's the time to switch your focus."

To explain a bit, this would be as a ""side thing"" for me since i like doing differen things. One service I wanted to offer is to ""casually"" look at other businesses websites and services and point out flaws and come up with a list of potential creative ways to improve and develop both the sites look and their services and come with new product and concept ideas for their area of work.   I would start around just 20-40 USD per client to get reviews and hopefully over some months some of them would implement some of my ideas and give good recommendations and as they vouch for the value of my service I would raise it.   My natural strenght from birth is coming up with ideas and concepts and simple inventions.

I loved the idea part of it and have many unused ideas in that area, so an architect or landscaping consultant market place could be interesting. Helping cities or malls to market themselves through creative playful and original ideas would be appealing. My park changed the whole demography of that little suburbs visitors from being mostly locals to bringing people from the whole city, country and actually whole world. Not in the sense that they would go to Sweden only for that park, but more in the sense that when they went to Sweden to skate anyways, this park and suburb became a favorite Place that they visited.  My last big client before that was www.tacky.no and www.tackyworld.com. I started www.tacky.se for them and got the statistics and ad sales going. I left it some years ago now though, they had 20-30 or so active banner customers at the same time when I stopped working there.  Another market I am into now is charity/philantropy.

They are not in the same industry as me, which is actually kind of awesome for a couple of reasons.   1 - I don't have to worry about keeping anything from them if they were direct competition in my industry and they would be since I'm nationwide.  2 - I learn new marketing and sales strategies from their viewpoint than from other related industry professionals who are probably doing the same thing I am.  Better than a mentor as well since we meet regularly where a mentor I mainly just contact sporadically when I have a specific question. My Mastermind group meets weekly and we share goals, successes, discuss new marketing ideas, figure out solutions to problems we are facing, go over any cool new ideas, talk about how to handle things that we need help with, etc. It's extremely useful!"

You could say ""Burst through the biggest roadblocks in your life - with advice from people you love"" - this is kind of lame since it doesn't have a big punch, but you get the idea. And it gives me a gist of what your app is about.  I know you wanted to have a mantra like Nike's ""Just do it"", but even with Nike, if you didn't know what Nike did and they had a page that said ""Nike. Just do it"" you're like ""Dude what"" when you see it. You can use it in your advertising or make it a part of your logo, but remember ""What's your idea?"" doesn't explain anything."

We could be way further along now if only I had worked harder, if only I had stayed that bit later, if only...  ...but that would also be true if I worked 25 hours a day. There is always room for improvement.   So the real question for me is: am I setting, communicating and meeting my growth targets? Am I consistently and effectively recruiting, improving and retaining my staff? Am I spending my time right to attract resources (clients, investors, allies) for the company?  The breakthrough for me came with the question ""if your wife was your CEO, would she hire you or fire you?"". It made me realize I have other, equally important obligations in my life. Obligations that I enjoy! And my no. 1 obligation to my wife, family, employees and shareholders is that I can effectively perform my duties.  That means I need sleep, and I need to be happy.  Why happy?  Because happy sells. Happy is easier to be around. Happy has energy and extra reserves for when a real crisis hits. If I'm already working 24/7 and there is a crisis - how fucked am I? If I'm used to going home at five and have to stay a couple of hours once a week or so - less fucked.   So, I went from working IN my company to working ON my company.    First - measured growth: clear targets and metrics mean that I know how we as a company and each employee is progressing. My employees know what is expected of them, how they are performing, and what the plan is. Every week they have to present figures to me, and explain the delta between their figures and our plan. Second - I started listening to the manager tools podcast which has helped me seriously improve staff communication and each employees impact on the bottom line. Third - it's not my job to do things, it's my job to make sure they get done (ideally by one of my employees). New conference talk? Where is that slide deck from last conference - recycle, and have Bryan fix the design on the two new slides. He's a great designer! Me - not so much. SoW amendments? Nate is better at those than I am anyway. I made it his job. Book proposal? Fuck, if I'm having trouble finding the time to write the proposal, how am I going to find time to write the book? Better find a ghost writer that can interview me..   ...Frankly, I'm under insane pressure. Everything is riding on this company working out. I've spent years of my life, put everything on the line - even got family to invest. I'm so fucked if this doesn't work. And anything could kill us. 200 startups in 18 months = 2.78 new ""killer products"" a week. But we are growing steadily, have a great team and a clear plan. I'm not ignoring the noise, but it's also not my job to react to every opportunity or crisis that comes across my table. I have people for that: people better at it than I am. So I let them take care of business, and make it my business to take care of them.  TLDR; The American Dream of hard work = success is more likely to be true if you make it someone else's hard work."

I've written a few articles on it over the years. http://www.inspireresults.com/balance-bunk-ditching-search-work-life-balance/  Instead of balance try these two steps:  First, boil down. Boil down what youâre doing to the essentialsârelationships, your business, health. Whatever these are for you, be brutally focused on what youâre passionate about and let the other things go.  I work with most every business coaching client on this, have blogged about it, and run a quarterly workshop on it, working off Simon Sinekâs Start with WHY.  If youâre driven each day by your WHY, youâll attract others who share your WHY.  Youâll have great customers andond devoted employees, all inspired to take action because you hook them with your purpose, your mission. The greatest companies and most effective individuals are those thatâve learned to harness that power of purpose.  Second, instead of maintaining the status quo, launch yourself into uncertainty with energy and drive. In Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi says that working hard at something to the point that it pushes your life off-kilter is much more rewarding than doing something safe, easy, conflict-free, and fun.  The pursuit of comfort is deadly. Diabetes and heart disease are out of control and diet pills replace exercise. I felt I was getting weak, soft, and was overweight.

They are usually solutions to problems and/or taking current ideas many steps further into something new and wanted that has potential to become big. But...    I am very bad at executing them and I lack passion to work with the slow execution part, because my passion is making ideas better and better and better and brainstorm part.   I am bad at finding people who have the  strenghts that I don't and making them interested so most of my ideas are unused until 5-15 years later.   Sooner or later the demand becomes more obvious and someone else gets the now more obvious idea and executes it.  Examples of ideas I had years before I saw them executed. I was surely not alone with all of them, but with the right partners I could still have turned it into a huge business.  Blogs (before the word existed). If I would have known a programmer/businessman at the time and he/she believed in the idea we could have been the inventors.   Many functions on facebook (before fb existed).   Twintip skis (they did exist as flatground freestyle skiing, but i saw the big potential of the more snowboardlike use and made prototypes 10 years or so before the industry)  TechDeck (may seem like a dumb toy, but is a multimillion business and I heard a rumor (never that I never looked into that the inventing kid got 2 million USD for the idea 10 years or so after I thought of it)  A new concept of skate parks (for bikes too) called street Plazas / skate plazas. Eventually DC Shoes and Rob Dyrdek got credit for making the first one. I actually got to make one that I started on before theirs. It was a great income, but I was burnt out due to finding good constructing partners and having to do it all myself so at the moment I will not make more.  I have maybe 10-20 other ideas now that I am sure will one day make multimillion or multibillion incomes for people and I will pursue some of them half-assed since execution is not my passion.   I am a bit tired of my own problem with finding long term partners because I want to see my ideas realized to their potential.  What makes me hard to work with/for is that during execution I quickly see most flaws that might make execution less functional and popular than the vision and I really want to make things according to the vision.   This  can be a strength since mistakes and flaws can be changed in time but it can and does also make some of the executors, subcontractors, consultants or employees crazy at times.  I should probably still monitor the quality but not communicate it directly to the executor but to a more diplomatic but still decisive partner in my company that is very good at breakingtough news to people without making them feel unappreciated or frustrated.

Well, if there are some people reading this who are multiple business owners in a broad field of products and services (that you want to become better and better through new ideas) then that could help.

If any of you need an idea producing and flaw detecting person looking at your website/business ideas and offer ways of making them even better then that is also an idea.   I would love to do such work and before we know eachother I would do it for a cost that means nothing at all to a company that sustains someone.   If anyone in the sub has ideas on where and how I could best find good partners that has the power to make good ideas come true and profitable then let me know.   And if anyone has a skilled construction company (should be able to build city or mall environments) want to build street plazas internationally or in your country that I design and sometimes even sell in, then let me know. The builders must take pride in details and perfection though, otherwise it won't work.   Sorry for the long post. ;)"

advancedentrepreneur,300cbm,ctwtn,5,Mon Mar 23 13:26:37 2015 UTC,"I'm probably biased here because I'm hosting a pitching competition in March, but the reason I'm doing so is because I've seen so much positive response from people who have competed.  Here's why I think you can't pitch too often in competitions:  They force you to raise your game when pitching, and let's face it, that's one of the worst things business owners do.  When someone says, ""What do you do?"" And you don't have a well rehearsed response, the results are often underwhelming.  Sadly, most entrepreneurs think this doesn't make a difference because it's ""just one person"" but they fail to see the big picture.  I recently wrong a blog on this exact subject.  Well quite similar.  Most pitching competitions are investor pitches, and this blog was about the social pitch.  But the results of a pitch should be the same.  Here's the blog with my self promotional links removed:  Every business owner knows the importance of having an elevator pitch and a sales pitch. The sophisticated business owner also has an investor pitch. But thereâs another pitch you need in your arsenal and most business owners rarely have spent anytime working on it.  The Social Pitch  This would be the pitch you use when you are at a social gathering, or a networking event. Itâs the answer to the all important question, âWhat do you do?â AND ITS THE MOST IMPORTANT PITCH FOR YOUR BUSINESS!  Why? Because when you do a social pitch the right way, that person walks away as a potential customer or sales person representing your company. Let me elaborate.  Rarely in life will the bulk of your wealth come from the people you know. The fruit doesnât grow on the trunk of a tree and your wealth wonât be attached to the people you already know. It will come from the people that they know, who talk about you to the people that they know. Your biggest sales will typically come from people 3 separations from you. Now if you want to make sure your message gets to those people correctly, youâd better make sure you have a kick-ass social pitch.  When you deliver the perfect social pitch, the person listening will respond   1 of 2 ways:  âYou need to meet my friend __________â  or  âWe need to meet later to talk about this, you just described me!â  And hereâs the message you DO NOT want to ever hear:  âOh, thatâs nice.â  When you nail that social pitch people will immediately know of someone who fits your ideal client. And if they donât, when they do meet them in the future, they will remember you and send the business your way at that time. Of course, if they fit the bill themselves, youâve immediately got a prospect ready to learn more.  Iâm offering a contest in Tampa, FL later this month called The BIG Pitch and Iâm offering a $25,000 cash prize to the best social pitch. But the irony is that the cash prize for the best pitch is the LEAST valuable part of the contest! The real value comes in being able to stand up in front of a group of people and pitch your business so that those 400 people now are out looking for your customers in the community.  Hereâs an example of the power of a social pitch. I met with Eric Higgs, the CEO of LumaStream Inc. at a dinner a few months back. LumaStream is one of the most innovative lighting companies in the world. After our dinner I knew exactly who his perfect client would be. Within 10 days of that dinner I met 3 people who would be a perfect fit and I introduced them to one another and the sale from just one of those 3 people alone could be worth over $100,000 in revenue. He didnât have to pay me a commission, hire me, pay for my health care or provide workmanâs compensation insurance for him, yet Iâm out there every day working for him because I was so impressed by what his company can do.

No Salesperson is ever going to be 'solid on your company'. They are going to solid on you as long as you make a product they can sell. If you can't, the only salespeople that will stay with you are the ones who can't go anywhere else.   the other manager is 100% wrong. If you like the candidate hope that she picks you."

advancedentrepreneur,2z1saq,tanglisha,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"It's fairly common for sales to be the first department to experience any cuts a company makes. They know this. Because of this, you're not going to find the same kind of company/brand loyalty that you might in other departments. They kind of have to be out for themselves.  One thing to keep in mind with sales is that they also need to sell themselves to you. It sounds like she's either done a good job of that or you're going off a great resume.  She might be waiting to give you an answer to see what the other company has to offer. She might be waiting because she's always wanted to work there and this could be a career building opportunity for her. It's really hard to say.   Chances are if the two companies are on similar grounds and she likes their offer better, she'll come to you looking for a comparable counter offer. Plenty of people do this, few are as straighforward about it as it sounds like she's been."
advancedentrepreneur,2z1saq,TopherMorrison,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:54:16 2015 UTC,"Encourage her to go to the other interview.  It's the right thing to do.  If you force her hand to take the position without exploring the other option, it's an unknown that will always be in the back of her mind.  If she goes and likes them more than you then she will go to where she is supposed to and you wouldn't want her to be working for you but wanting to be somewhere else.  If she goes to the other interview, and doesn't like it, then comes back to you, she's in a weaker negotiation spot because you already know she doesn't have anything else to take."
advancedentrepreneur,2z1saq,InspireResults,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:51:28 2015 UTC,Sales people live and breathe commissions and opportunity. Let her explore all the opportunities and if she chooses your position she will be more loyal for having considered all the options.
advancedentrepreneur,2z1saq,ArekDymalski,1 point,Thu May 21 15:05:03 2015 UTC,"When you compare the levels of competencies of her and the 2nd candidate,  how big is the gap? Does #2 have the potential to grow and fill this gap?   Did you ask the girl, what exactly is she hoping to achieve? Is it about the salary/benefits,location, time or something specifically related to the other company?   I'm asking because hiring the girl brings a risk, you've probably already discussed internally: she doesn't seem to be strongly motivated to work for your company (but,honestly, most of candidates aren't unless you're Google) - instead she seems to seek something what you didn't offer her yet. And this means, that even if she'll join you she may still be looking for better conditions. And in that case the question is how much time&money will you loose for recruiting and training another person.  On the other hand, she just might be good hustler/negotiator and if these are traits your company needs, the benefits could be greater than risks.  BTW, how much time has passed between the interview and the offer for her?"

There was a good discussion recently on the topic in the BeAFreelanceWriter forums here.  One thing you may want to keep in mind is that it will likely that a lot of small steps to get there. For example, you might start by writing for small local publications and build up some clips before you start pitching the big publications. Then it may take a few odd assignments at different publications before you're considered as a columnist.  Hope that helps :) Don't give up & keep trying!"
advancedentrepreneur,2yejk3,JoeLumbergh,15,Mon Mar 9 03:04:17 2015 UTC,"Does Affiliate Marketing work?   Rarely but sometimes. The vast majority of people who have a go at it try a bunch of stuff, make an amount of money in the zero to very little range and eventually just move on with their life. A very small percentage of people make a non-trivial amount of money. A very very small percentage of people actually make enough to make any kind of significant difference in their life.  For example, check this out. http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/my-january-2015-monthly-income-report/ ctrl+f down to ""INCOME BREAKDOWN (JANUARY 2015)""  Look at his sites. GreenExamAcademy.com, SecurityGuardTrainingHQ.com etc. He is making a few thousand dollars a month per site. Sounds good except remember that this guy is basically the Michael Jordan of affiliate marketing. The Bill Gates of affiliate marketing. He is at the top of the food chain and he is maybe pulling in a few grand a month per site and only has a handful of sites.  Where he makes his big money is this stuff...   Bluehost.com: $40,200.00 (How to create a blog in less than 4 minutes with Bluehost)  LeadPages: $10,457.30 (The Free LeadPages Rapid List-Building 2.0 Webinar Replay)   This is him showing others how to get into affiliate marketing. There is far more money to be had selling the dream Vs actually building out affiliate sites which is why there is such a massive volume of BS on the topic.  By the way, I don't intend this to sound like I am bashing Pat Flynn (the smart passive income guy). He is a smart guy. I've listened to his podcast. He is quite a likable fellow and knows his stuff.  So yes it does work but a lot of the money isn't in affiliate marketing so much as it is in teaching people about affiliate marketing.   I dont mind paying for a good education   And so the cycle continues ;)"

I don't blame them, but when someone commits to sending out an email on your behalf with an affiliate link, and then doesn't do it, it's totally annoying.   Rather than have 1000 affiliates, try to find the 10 that will actually do something anyway and focus on them.  Those 10 tend to be the one you would recommend to your customers anyway regardless of what's in it for you, and they feel similar about you.  Rather than use affiliates I just have a team of powerful associates that I respect as much as they respect me and we endorse each others products and don't expect anything in return.

A good friend of mine with a very successful coffee franchise once told me, ""You will never be able to grow your business if you are unwilling to leverage debt""  Some of the biggest companies in the world use lines of credit.  It's a necessary component to businesses that require upfront expenses before the payment of delivery occurs."

It's also quite a bit different than YPA in that everyone is an entrepreneur (most/many who are bootstrapped).

advancedentrepreneur,2vd91g,photoengineer,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:15:33 2015 UTC,"CTR and conversion rate. If the app is getting sales, but you are lacking serious momentum.   What I would do/suggest is contact every person who bought/signed up. (Depending on how many people are on it.) Send them a business owner/CEO email/something along those lines. Ask, if they would be willing to spend a few minutes with you on an unrecorded call. (Say it's to help the app be better for them, throw in a bonus if you must.) But do what you can to engage your customers, over the phone. Ask them questions, how did you feel about photography? How did you feel when you signed up or bought? What made you realise you needed this? etc...  To understand the deeper psychology of your customer and potential customer. A lot of the time, good copywriting, high conversions rates. Come from a higher understanding of context. The better your page, evokes your customers emotions the higher the probability for conversion is.   When you are doing this, focus on the language your average customer uses. The similarities, in frustrations/reasons for purchase. The way they describe the frustration, etc... These must all be slammed into your front page, emails/newsletter, etc.. If copywriting isn't your strong suite. This is a great way to get a lot more results.  Nothing sells a product better than a consumer raving to a friend about it.   Cause if it works, figure out why, double down on it, then play to your niche market first, then grow out. Most of the time.  Products we use. In a way understand us or our problem. (Think about the variants of running shoes by nike, travel bags with the space for your laptop, etc.) The better you are at putting it in context for me, the more likely I will buy. Conversion fundamentally works on this core principle, so does copywriting.   Ok, rant over..   My advice in short. Find out what's working and why. Compare it to what you have, then change what you need to, from research. (Split-test) Then angle everything towards the reason people are buying and go from there. It's also easy to measure. Customers like talking to the owner, let them talk for awhile. You can also figure out what they don't like about the product so far and tweak. Hope this helps and makes sense.."

I do like the wallet though, and would have bought one had the option been available.   I don't understand why you make an unbounce page for this honestly. Surely it would have been a better option to make a landing style page, with an option to buy the product? I'm sure you would have made multiple sales already.  Do you have some ready? If not I can kind of understand it. I would have added a Pre-order option though."

advancedentrepreneur,2rlgso,Aerocom42,3,Wed Jan 7 04:36:59 2015 UTC,"A successful website caters to your visitor's needs  It's natural to want to be more technologically advanced, but most often it's not the right decision for your business.  Â   Have you thought this through from your clients point of view?   I would like to scale the company exponentially   Has anyone complained to you about not being able to place an order from their iPhone? Is that the convenience they're after?  Rather than wading your industry into new territory, why not identify your bread and butter client (makes up the bulk of your revenue, is easy to work with, is easy to acquire, etc.) and ask them:   What are the important things I do well? What do you wish was easier when working with me? Can you name anyone who's been struggling recently with [answer from previous question]?   This gets you solid feedback from the right type of client, that you can translate into better serving prospective clients with similar needs.  A handful of phone calls will likely uncover a bunch of information that you can leverage, and also gives you some things to think about in terms of easy improvements.  Â   Have you thought this through from your businesses point of view?   My goal with the new website is to really streamline my customers' procurement   It sounds helpful to have a master list of products with inventory, photos, pricing, etc., but...  Some things to consider before we move ahead:   Who is going to keep this content updated? (Presumably this has to be done on the fly, or else what's the point?) How much time and resources have been budgeted for this?   You have budgetted some $1x,000 to build this, so it's doable both financially and technically... Now, once the framework is in place, what are your plans to keep it moving?  My guess is that you'll get it done and realise managing it is a way larger task than you had originally bartered for.  From there, it can become ultra-messy. My goal here is not to scare you, but to make sure you consider of all the dynamics at play not just today but for the future.  Â   My suggestions  Look at the areas in your business that are currently working, then double-down on them until they're no longer profitable.  In the case of updating your web presence, here are my high level suggestions:  Â   Collect your visitor's email address  For every 100 visitors, how many of them click ""Contact us"" and/or pick up the phone to call you? One or two? Mayyybe three?  What happens to the other 97%?  One of the easiest and most powerful things your website can do is get the email addresses of people who are on your site, interested in what you do, but not quite ready to buy today.  By getting their email address you're able to continue the conversation over the next few months while they make a decision on who to do business with.  Â   Use their email address to continue the conversation  After collecting their email address, use an email auto-responder to drip thoughtful, educational emails to them every few days.  This builds authority, establishes trust, educates your prospect automatically, answers the questions they have, and holds their hand step-by-step towards being able to make a buying decision.  Then, when they're ready to buy... they think of you.  Â   Offer something of value in exchange for the email address  Learn what your prospective clients are looking for/struggling with, then package that in a useful piece of content for them.  You can learn this by picking up the phone and talking to past clients (as mentioned earlier), or by looking at your web traffic and asking yourself:   How are they finding my website? (Search engines, word of mouth, magazines, trade shows) How are they using my website? (Where are they clicking? How long are they staying?)   Once you've established some of the trends, ask yourself:   What information are they looking for and finding? What information are they looking for and not finding?   From there, put together a short document of the information they're interested in.   Ten Things to Consider When Choosing Jet Aircraft Parts After-Market Aircraft Parts: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly   You get the picture. People are willing to give their email address in exchange for information they find valuable. Remember this is a person who is in the market for aftermarket aircraft parts and is on your site.  It costs $0 to ask them for their email address, and gives you a permanently growing list of people to market to in the future.  Â   What to take from this?  The short answer is there's no one-size-fits-all, but I believe a list of email addresses is a huge leg-up for people in ""traditional"", ""blue collar"", or ""offline"" businesses.  You need to think about your customer's needs, not how to bring technology to an industry.  If they're not complaining about your lack of a mobile app, then stay away from it.  Instead, find out what they're struggling with, and look for a low-tech solution to solve it.  Â   tl;dr Decide what your potential customers are looking for, and deliver."

advancedentrepreneur,2rlgso,acerldd,2,Wed Jan 7 12:34:18 2015 UTC,"It's very inspiring to hear about your success! Thanks for sharing.  So the prices. It really depends what quality you want to get. Usually there are many specialists involved in the process of developing an ecommerce website: front-end dev, back-end dev, project manager, photographer, designer, UX designer, copywriter/s, content manager/s, digital marketing specialist/s (SEO, CPC, etc). So you really need a company to get exceptional results and the price tag might be somewhere between $5k to $100k (and beyond). For example, if you need custom marketing automatization to sync your warehouse with website... this will make a hole in a pocket if you are looking at custom-made solution.  You can get a lone-wolf too (odesk, freelancer, /r/forhire etc). That hypothetical lone-wolf is good at something and mediocore on everything else but it's still possible to get an amazing result. You are looking at $2k-5k (US/Canadian/UK based freelancers usually charge $20+/hour).  There are a lot of ""Software as a Service"" (SaaS) solutions too and Shopify is the most popular one. It's the cheapest route.  Another ""tight budget"" route is to use open-source platforms (woocommerce, opencart, prestashop and so on). A lot of work is already done and can be reused (modules, themes etc). Usually above-mentioned ""lone-wolfs"" would charge around $500+ for it. Few days ago I wrote an extensive comment with approx. hourly rates. You can check it out if you wish.  Hope this helps."
advancedentrepreneur,2rlgso,2cool4leprosarium,2,Wed Jan 7 15:28:35 2015 UTC,"We just went through a rebrand/redesign with our company last year.  In previous iterations, we'd just used 99designs and cheapo ""designers"" to help us mash something together that worked.  This time, we put way more thought into it and hired a pro who could implement our vision and had an eye for UX.  We're really, really happy with how everything turned out. Here's the guy we used:  http://jonmyers.com/  Feel free to check him out, but make sure to look at 4-5 designers at least.  Here are some tips:   Go through the process of creating a design brief. Ours was more than 20 pages, so this isn't something to take lightly. This will guide your designer and keep you on track during the process. Will also help you better understand WHY you are doing this. A designers job is NOT done when handed over to development. Make sure they understand there will be some back and forth AND you'll need them post-launch to review and make additional changes to improve customer experience. A better looking site does not guarantee better conversions. In fact, they may get WORSE in some areas. Our purpose for rebranding was so that we could reach a more sophisticated audience. Our email optins went down after the redesign, but we expected that. Our average sale price went up and that's what we were looking for.   Hope that helps and good luck!"

advancedentrepreneur,2rlgso,vfefer,1 point,Fri Jan 9 20:05:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I realized after hit save that I didn't provide a solution. Ask around in your network for recommendations. Like other users have said, you don't need someone to reinvent the wheel - everything you've mentioned can be done - but you need someone who you trust and has proven abilities. Ask to see portfolios, then ask for typical project costs, then ask what you get for less (you want someone who will say ""if we take off 8K then you lose the following functionality on your site"") then ask for different functionality and what that would cost (""if we add a commenting and rating system within product types, how will that affect timelines and costs?""). Timelines are important, ask for milestones. Be ready to pay real money (you mentioned low 5 figures, which is fine) but also make sure they're delivering (wire frames, design, placeholder copy, real copy, images, QA site for testing).     I'll also give a small plug for my niche - most web design shops say they can ""do SEO."" They're lying. So if organic search is a big driver of traffic (and people buy from your site) you'll probably want to either find and outside SEO consultant to look over what they're proposing before launch (2nd best option) or a small agency that specializes in digital marketing to partner with them on this project(best option), or find a digital shop that really does both(worst option, not really doable) but it's almost impossible to find such a place - because everyone specializes."

WordPress is the best platform to go with in terms of CMS and designing something that is responsive is a must. Responsive web design simply is a site that response to whatever device someone is viewing your website on. So if viewed on a smartphone, tablet or desktop, website reformates itself to that device. Ecommerce can easily be set up on most WordPress sites and you will have no issues with a customer portal either. A site can be customized easily for under $2,000 so this would be well within your budget. My company designs websites so I can offer many suggestions but don't want to come off selling myself.

There were a few things I did to manage the stresses, in order of biggest positive effect to least positive effect (but still important)--  1) Simplifying my life-- I made sure to lean out everything that was a drain on me-- things I didn't need anymore, activities I didn't enjoy anymore,etc. I donated a ton of things away, I got rid of all distractions that didn't have a positive effect on my life.  This was large things as social activities I just wasn't interested in, to mass unsubscribing from a ton of emails.  Less means more energy to focus on the things that matter.  2) Work with my own circadian rhythm -- For whatever reason, the late-night hours are best for me when I need to be uber focused for things like writing, coding, etc.  For things like phone calls and negotiations, early more is best for me.  Mid afternoon is a lull.  Once I accepted that there is a good time of the day for things, I scheduled my day around how my body operates, and accepted that there will be downtime and scheduled for it.

Make it relevant and approach the right journalists and the right outlets. It's about building a relationship and sending a too canned email as the first point of contact lessens your chances of success. Why should they care? Why should their audience care?  Remember to show willingness upfront to offer them them real access; information, numbers and the real story behind it, whatever they need to write their story.  Last point of advice I hear from journalists: Don't spend time writing stupid press releases. If the story is good enough to bring, they'll gladly write it themselves.

advancedentrepreneur,2pkl1a,abw80,3,Wed Dec 17 12:33:51 2014 UTC,"What I have heard (but not verified myself) is this:   Raise your business profile, by making sure you have a good solid, official ""Big Brand"" business profile on LinkedIn.  Consult w/ a marketer or even someone on Fiverr should be able to guide you. Do the ""article"" thing.  LinkedIn allows you to submit articles (blog or otherwise) relevant to your industry, this can increase engagements. Reach out directly to others in you industry, maybe by sending them your more popular articles and case studies as a reason for you to connect.  Do this on a limited basis (no spam!) and only to users who would obviously have a possible interest. Create and ""raise the profile"" of an industry group.  As an example, my personal background is in software development and I am constantly getting requests to join an ""Object Oriented User Group"" which shall remain nameless.  The gist of it is, with your affiliated ""User Group"", you or your employees have more license to reach out, potentially to the entire industry, if your group is broad enough.   Again, I am only in the beginning stages of implementing this plan myself on LI.  However, it is consistent with Facebook, Pinterest etc. strategy (which I have had success with), so I can't imagine it not working to some degree."
advancedentrepreneur,2pkl1a,angryrancor,3,Wed Dec 17 22:25:11 2014 UTC,"Your success rate is going to depend a lot on what you say and how you approach people. If you're going straight to sales mode, it's going to be an uphill battle. If you're soliciting people for advice, you'll get a higher initial response rate, but you'll need to put in more effort to bring it closer to a sale of any kind.   You didn't really say what you were trying to accomplish, which makes it hard to give meaningful advice."

advancedentrepreneur,2p926m,kdohgeegee,2,Sun Dec 14 13:51:19 2014 UTC,"Couple of things to think about:   Transferring calls when engaged to third party call answering service who will answer your calls. Purchase a telephone system that can park calls, increasing the number of lines on your main number. Convert your main number to VoIP and have a call queue with a reassurance message ""your call is important to us"" etc.   If it was me I would try number one first to see how many calls I was missing and if that justifies spending money to sort.  Budget;   Approx extra Â£25-50 to try per month Approx Â£1500-2000 Approx Â£300-500 to set up.   Hope that helps!"

This, and the limited personal liability, are the main draws of an LLC for solo entrepreneurs."
advancedentrepreneur,2olv4t,swollbuddha,3,Mon Dec 8 02:57:48 2014 UTC,"Ok thanks. And how do you make sure you do everything by the books? I remember reading somewhere you need to set up a separate business bank account and credit card to separate the charges you use for business use vs personal use, but not sure what exactly all that entails or what to do with that once you have them separate. So you can spend money on anything and say it is a business expense, and whatever you have left at the end of the year is what only gets taxed?"
advancedentrepreneur,2olv4t,swollbuddha,4,Mon Dec 8 04:58:09 2014 UTC,"Keeping separate accounts helps keep the matter of business assets and personal assets well-defined, making it easier to stay protected in liability cases and easier to justify what was and wasn't a business expense for auditing. I'm not a tax expert, so ultimately if you're dealing with a lot of money in this situation you should seek qualified sources.  As for what's an expense, make sure you're only spending company money on legitimate company expenses, and only spending personal money for personal transactions. If you're being wise, most of the money you're spending will be on things that actually help expand the business (advertising, web development etc.) rather than office furniture or a new car.  I highly recommend taking an accounting course (Khan Academy might have one?) and becoming acquainted with the basics of how money moves in a legitimate business entity."
advancedentrepreneur,2olv4t,angryrancor,2,Mon Dec 8 05:36:30 2014 UTC,"Nobody really touched the ""business vs personal expense"" question;   Having worked both at companies where I had to do expense reports, as well as doing them for my own LLC, hopefully I can assist.  This article gives some tips on how to decide Business vs Personal expense:  http://taxes.about.com/od/businessexpenses/qt/BusinessExpense.htm  In general though, the IRS rules are quite vague on this - so my general rule is, if the purchase obviously adds value to the business, or is a necessary cost of doing the business (regardless of how it fits in your plan, as long as it does fit in the overall business plan), it is a business expense.  Most common question I know of:   What if only part of the expense is business?  Ok, a few examples here, the first is a non itemized expense.  Lets say you are flying to Florida.  You have a biz meeting the first day, then 3 days vacation, and fly back.  The first day, more than likely, all your expenses are business expenses.  The next three days, you will probably be running in to at least a few ""entertainment expenses"", which are only deductible 50%-80% dependent on circumstance.   If you are feeling brave... Here is the most relevant IRS publication I can find on it http://www.irs.gov/publications/p463/ch02.html  It's the IRS, so some of the rules are quite ""in-depth"" with their qualifications and can be hard to understand.  This is where a good accountant friend, or the CPA you hired to help with taxes, can save you a lot of stress.  As always, best of luck!"

I would look into getting with an expert in the field and see about specifically targeting the right people with your ads.

I'm sure that you face far bigger challenges than I did because I always stayed in the USA, but one thing that I always have to remind myself is that fans (and your network) are built one person at a time.  Whenever you meet someone, make the best of it and be in the moment.  If you're thinking about how you need to meet 4 more people at the event you're attending, you're not really listening to or connecting with the person in front of you.  I constantly have to remind myself of this whenever I go on a fan/networking campaign.  I have a lot of luck just keeping my ears open and go from there.  Some of the best relationships I've formed were from turning down work that I didn't think was worth my time and passing it along to a budding artist who I thought showed promise.  In those situations, I saved the day for the promoter needing to fill a date, and helped out a young buck just getting started.    For me what's paid off really well was not being too targeted.  It gives me access to different resources and ideas than everyone else who's doing the same thing that I am, and more importantly, things change.  I've seen reputable guys go belly up and skip town and known burn outs who happen to be the cousin of someone who's looking for supporting artists to tour internationally.

So my deal would allow him to focus on creating kale and kale only.  Running the product world ties up a ton of capital and buying in bulk ingredients to reduce ingredient cost is a lot of money upfront.  I also plan on selling the business within 5-10 years so he could see a descent payout in equity.  On the other hand though, I don't know.  I'm exploring one option I have right now of sourcing the ""kale"" from someone who believes they can do the same product or get damn close.  Will not even think about approaching the farmer until I hear back from new guy.  Just trying to weigh my options and hear some opinions here.

The real money here is in the retailing of the the product and if you can work together you can destroy the competition (sounds like it may already be gone) and benefit from price increases because your brand dominates the market.    You have to be prepared to replace him with another source of kale.  If you can't do that then you are working from a position of weakness and you will have to accept whatever he will give.  If you can replace him, then you two will go head to head in the market, both of you will be using price as a weapon and both of you will make less profit.  Much less profit.  In a non-threatening way, ask him if both of you could make more money in the long run if he is brought in as an equity partner in your business.  That way he sticks to growing kale and you stick to making chips and you both win.  And don't assume that he is enjoying making chips and that it is profitable for him.  It may not be his thing.

Your knowledge of the marketplace, dynamic strategies (loss leaders, bundling, upselling, etc) and a good relationship with the customer.  You should try to figure out how much direct business he is doing. If his relationship with you is worth more, you would have plenty of leverage to just kick him off the market.

It can be perfectly acceptable not to pay an intern (or pay as much as you can afford), but then he/she will be expecting that you put time into teaching him valuable lessons that will increase personal skills and job opportunities in the future.  This is a consideration you will have to make, and when you do an interview process with the intern also discuss eachothers goals with that person. If they are smart enough to work for you, they should be smart enough to talk about this reasonably. If he/she is expecting to learn a lot from the internship but your aim is just to get manual work done with as little time as possible, he will most likely indeed become unreliable and demotivated.   My two cents!"

What I meant is that it would be perfectly fine not to pay an internship as long as you meet his other expectations.   For a lot of students, getting experience in any field of sales (Lead generation or 'cold calling) would be very valuable, but it does mean you would have to spend time into teaching this and making sure it will be a pleasant experience (throwing an inexperienced student into the deep with cold calling, with high expectations can quite quickly turn into a stressful experience), but done correctly it could definitely be a good intern opportunity! Maybe instead of pay, get him a certificate or training from a professional sales-training company? Something he can take with him."

advancedentrepreneur,2mq8be,RiChardge,1 point,Wed Nov 19 15:40:47 2014 UTC,"This really depends on the type of internship. If you are a final class for an intern the game is very different.  Yes you will learn from us but we are not here to teach you. An intern is the culmination of book and lab knowledge translating into the real world. We train you where necessary but you are supposed to sink or swim on your own accord. Every two weeks we have a review cycle where we talk about how everything is going and can be quite frank with individuals. We also give this feedback in report forms back to the educators. If their education is falling short the school needs to know about it.  Most interns use us as part of their letter grade and are not going to class while they are with us. Knowing this you should not have an expectation to pay, you're not in the way of their normal work, you are their class time. A nice bonus, gift, etc are great ways to show love/appreciation.  So YMMV broadly. Hence good communication and eyes-wide-open approach will save a lot of headaches for both parties."
advancedentrepreneur,2mq8be,ciordia9,1 point,Fri Nov 21 15:59:17 2014 UTC,"I agree with that completely, and in that case it would fit in as the third reason why a student would become your intern besides learning something or money; college credit.   Indeed it obviously depends on the situation, the company and the person. Therefore I again think that talking to a potential intern and being open and honest about what you are willing to spend (time/money/training) and expecting from him is essential. Same goes for the intern, ask him what he expects to be doing and getting."
advancedentrepreneur,2mq8be,zirconst,3,Fri Nov 21 17:22:21 2014 UTC,"We love interns. We treat them very well and have hired 50% of ours at this time.  Every school is different. Our name is on a different list at each school as an internable program. You just need to figure out which programs you can apply for. At least 3/4 of the schools we're listed with have come out to interview us and look at our facilities. They have a vested interest in this since all of these interns are using us as credit. So instead of them going to a class, we are the class. We don't supercede their other jobs and life/work relations.  Each year we have learned a lot about this process. Some interns are gems, true gems. Others I don't know why they even go to school. We've learned to ferret out potential interns before bringing them onboard. You have to understand that they will take some cost from you in being educated, under foot, in your business. That's a sunk time cost. If they benefit you, great, if they don't they will drag down productivity. We now have interns sign a contract with us. In essence it says they will treat us with respect and honor their commitment to us. We've had a few interns that just call in sick during our peak season and that costs us dearly.  As to what you need to do for them, our philosophy is we're not here to teach you, we're here to test you. You went to school, you learned a lot, now apply it. If you need help we'll give it, but this is your final for many and you sink or swim in a real environment. We have them work on many of our projects and we also let each intern self-assign a project they must complete during their stay. That way they have some of their own skin in the game and 9 out of 10 times it makes them incredibly happy to accomplish something of their own that helps us.  Interns can be great but there are caveats for it all around. Have a good relationship with the schools, know everyones expectations up front, have a good review cycle where you can break them down, and handle good reporting back to their schools. You do well by the school you'll be more inclined to get more interns in the future. You do bad and you will never get one again.  Much luck in your trip down this and after a few come back and post your moments. You'll have them and its great to share them with others. :)"

advancedentrepreneur,2mq8be,jwcooke,2,Fri Nov 21 17:33:33 2014 UTC,"Absolutely, I've worked with about 6 interns, all of them from my alma mater Drexel University. Upsides - if you do some kind of official posting through a university, you'll likely get a pool of motivated candidates. People that are interested in what you do - and I recommend getting people interested in your specific industry not just ""business"" in general (just IMO). Can really help you get stuff done. Downside is that you have to spend some extra time managing/checking work and teaching.   Overall, I think it's worth it as long as you (1) take the time to select someone who is a good fit for your business, (2) treat them well & actually teach them things, (3) don't expect them to do the work of a full-time employee w/ years of experience."
advancedentrepreneur,2mq8be,ashtonias,2,Sat Nov 22 04:00:34 2014 UTC,"The biggest thing with interns is government oversight and how much that actually affects, interns are not free labor, which many companies do not realize. Technically interns are supposed to do tasks that shadow a certain aspect or more than one aspect, to benefit themselves for school credit or experience. It is actually pretty expensive to maintain an unpaid intern costs roughly 20k a year. Our sales reps cost on average 90k to maintain. It is a difference of about 70k but you cannot demand the same things from them, things have been tightening up with government agencies on having interns and unfortunately the smaller your company the less time you have to sit in court if your intern reports you or money. Interns can be a great resource or a terrible waste of time it really depends on the people and the format of the business."
advancedentrepreneur,2mq8be,edutuit,2,Thu Dec 11 02:09:38 2014 UTC,"This is an interesting subject for me. We're currently looking to bring on our fourth intern (we call them apprentices) and we've had some success with the model.  I should also mention that our apprentice positions are paid positions. This is mostly due to the fact that we require them to come halfway around the world to SE Asia to work directly with us for the first 6 months.  Some thoughts on the model:  The goal on your end should really be a long-term position within your organization. It takes at LEAST 3 months to get someone up to speed - probably more like 6 months - and so you're going to need them to be with you long enough to get a return on that investment. And it IS an investment...interns can take up a ton of your time.  Make this clear to the intern at the beginning. You want someone that will be with you longer-term, IMO. If they just stuck around for 6 months I think you'd struggle with your ROI on time.  Hire for atttitude more than skillsets. If you need a concrete, specific thing done in your business consider a proven contractor rather than an intern. You want someone who can figure out more open questions in your business, IMO.  I know we have a rather unconventional apprenticeship, but if you'd like to take some look at our offer to get some ideas for your own:  http://empireflippers.com/account-manager-position-saigon/"

advancedentrepreneur,2lt3fg,subtleamuzement,3,Tue Nov 11 03:12:31 2014 UTC,"I am just giving you the other side of the argument and not trying to be a jerk.   That said, the value of any business is the present value of all the net cash it can generate over its lifetime. If an owner can invest in growth and get a sufficient return, then that's obviously what should be done and value will be increased. If excess cash is invested in things that don't meet a certain level of return, value is destroyed. Sprucing up the office beyond a certain level, buying espresso machines, throwing lunches, etc., I would argue, won't add value. Creating a business on the side that just loses money for 3 yrs or so and then starts to become profitable (there's that tax issue again) may or may not add value depending on how easy it is to just do that and dial up profits when needed.  There are a lot of asset lite business models out there that face the same issue. Many businesses Warren Buffett wholly owns fall into that category. I know he doesn't tell the managers of those businesses to just make the office really nice and buy a bunch of stuff with the extra cash in order to use up pre-tax dollars. No, he directs that if they can grow the business with projects/investments that add value then do it, otherwise send the cash to him (after tax, btw) and he will allocate that capital."

In some instances those customers have become frustrations due to using up too much time, claiming orders are incorrect, etc.  To stop this, we told them that we can no longer accept phone orders from them. We positioned it as our fault no theirs - ""We keep making errors when we take your phone orders. To prevent this please place your orders via the website and that way you will get exactly what you ordered, and we will stop making mistakes.""  Sounds sort of silly, but it worked.

I've only ever refunded a handful of people but it certainly didn't make my business fall apart, and it certainly DID save me a lot of time & sanity. Sometimes it's not an issue of refunding either, but simply drawing a line and saying that support only goes so far.

advancedentrepreneur,2lh85y,Valentinial,6,Thu Nov 6 21:05:03 2014 UTC,I practice mindfulness everyday.   I started with this guide:  http://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Eight-Week-Finding-Peace-Frantic/dp/1609618955  I believe it's fundamentally transformed who I am and how I live.
advancedentrepreneur,2lh85y,dr_bdennis,3,Thu Nov 6 15:29:04 2014 UTC,In what way transformed if you don't mind me asking?  I usually try to avoid books like this if I'm honest.
advancedentrepreneur,2lh85y,dr_bdennis,1 point,Thu Nov 6 16:48:14 2014 UTC,"It gave me tools to deal with that inner monologue that would never seem to shut up and the automatic self that doesn't always do what I want it to do.  There's plenty of options available for free on mindfulness, for example;  http://www.investigatinghealthyminds.org/index.html  I liked that particular book because it surveyed the research supporting the concept and techniques then laid out a step by step plan to practice them.  That was a good structure for me to buy in to the notion."
advancedentrepreneur,2lh85y,dr_bdennis,1 point,Thu Nov 6 21:41:31 2014 UTC,"Kudos. If you're not the meditating type, then listen to an Audio Book. Play white-noise. Do something that's different to break the thinking pattern. I rely on a technique i got from a book a long time ago: drawing lines to connect parts of your body - start at your toes, then draw a line to your ankle, then knee, thigh, etc. As you connect more parts, you must maintain the connection lines you've already made. As soon as i get to my abdominal areas i pass the fuq out. Weird, but works."
advancedentrepreneur,2lh85y,h4ckluserr,1 point,Thu Nov 6 17:58:35 2014 UTC,"That's good mindfulness practice too.  Mindful meditation isn't ""meditation"" in the spiritual, pop culture sense.  It's about quieting that inner monologue and being fully aware in the moment.  Each meditation is practicing how to do just that.  It's hard.  I love Audible, I listen to them nearly every day during my commute.  I hadn't realized how much was missing until  I started practicing mindfulness.  I used to start listening then I would end up  day dreaming or planning or rehashing or whatever it is we do in our minds and missing most of the material.    Now I listen, start day dreaming, planning or rehashing but get aware of the drift and can more easily refocus on the material."
advancedentrepreneur,2lh85y,acerldd,3,Thu Nov 6 21:44:04 2014 UTC,"I have a passion for reading.  Therefore I read!  First thing in the morning I read non-fiction.  Something to get my brain cooking.  I'm currently working my way through ""The 7 day Startup: You don't learn until you launch."" And it's fantastic.  At the end of the day, I read fiction.  I've just finished up David Edding's Belgariad and the Mallorean.  Very unique approach to magic in the world."
advancedentrepreneur,2lh85y,acerldd,2,Thu Nov 6 19:04:05 2014 UTC,I like to read but man sometimes I can't focus on a book when there is other more pressing matters on my mind.   I always think to myself I am wasting precious time that I could be spent doing something useful.
advancedentrepreneur,2lh85y,acerldd,3,Sat Nov 8 15:09:13 2014 UTC,"Step 1) Get it out of my head. Normally I can't sleep if I'm thinking about an idea or problem. If I write it down I'm instantly freed because I know I won't forget it and that I can return to it at a better time.  Step 2) Remain cognizant of the need for balance. This goes hand in hand with mindfulness that someone else mentioned.  Step 3) Work at work and play at home. The physical barrier creates a mental barrier and allows your brain to change gears.  Or, if you work at home, designate a set space.   This also applies to sleeping. Sleep in bed, work in your office. Don't work in bed. It disrupts your ability to actually sleep when you climb into bed.  4) As with most of life, what happens to you and what you do is normally about the decisions you make.   You need to approach this, and the rest of your life with the knowledge that you are in control.   You control what you choose to be preoccupied with. This gets back to the mindfulness.  Most of the time, work is for work time and play is for play time, but being mindful and in control means that sometimes work time extends longer than at other times. And this is ok - as long as it is for a good reason and it is because it is something you choose rather than something that is controlling you and your time.  For instance, I normally work a standard 8 hour day and don't work on the weekends at all. Sometimes when I'm not inspired or interested I just do the bare minimum. But, right now I'm in the middle of putting in place new marketing and experiencing some unusual growth. As a result I'm actively choosing to spend much more time on work than normal. And I will probably keep doing that until the inspiration ends.  I'm doing it both because I want to get as much out of my current growth as possible and because this is what gets me charged, so why not spend more time doing it.  That is very different than working 8 more hours a day because there are customer service emails and I want to tweak the color pallet on my site by a hair and if I just read one more blog post everything will fall into place.  If you actually read all this - GREAT! - I'm interested in you answering, ""What are you doing when you are preoccupied and busy?"""
advancedentrepreneur,2lh85y,CharlieBeaulieu,1 point,Sat Nov 8 12:10:06 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response.  Some good pointers that I will try and implement.   Most of the time I set myself a target. I will just show you what happened last night.   I decided that I was going to create a HTML/PHP form for my website without much knowledge etc. This was at about 6pm. I had spent the day on Live chat/responding to email answering phone, so nothing productive in terms of bettering the website. That means I have to get it done after our customer service hours close. I looked at the free implementations available, that will build the form for you, but they all add a backlink to their site. This looks unprofessional and not an option.   So I'm down to coding the form myself. Setting up the PHP on backend to mail it to me, and formatting the mail so that it is readable. Of course I run into issues, because I'm not a web developer. 12 caffeine fuelled hours later I am complete yes! God damn it! It's 6am. So I sleep like 2.5 hours and then I'm up for 9 back to ""work"".  P.S The almighty form in all it's glory! https://fusion-pc.com/index.php/custom-build-requests  SO. This is what usually happens. I get to doing something ""preoccupied"", and just don't really stop until it's done. I rarely sleep more than 4 hours!"
advancedentrepreneur,2lh85y,BigSlowTarget,1 point,Sat Nov 8 15:08:23 2014 UTC,So two obvious questions are: - why not use the free form and adapt to your needs/ remove the coding for the backlink (since you are adept enough to do that)   did you enjoy it? I'm asking because sometimes I will do the same thing. I will spend hours working on something like this instead of just higher a coder to bang it out. But I personally think that is ok. Because when I get a sense of satisfaction throughout the task and especially once complete.   As long as it isn't totally detracting from actual revenue generating activity and staying healthy I say why not. Although maybe you should have broken it into two sections and got some sleep...it is just a form :)
advancedentrepreneur,2lh85y,sevoque,1 point,Sat Nov 8 16:55:18 2014 UTC,"Well that is pretty much just stealing someone's work, and it's not really fair. If they say you can use it with the backlink, and you remove the backlink, it's kinda shitty thing to do. All the ones I looked at came with a backlink!  I enjoy the final result, and knowing how everything works so that I can easily change and adapt. I mean if I ever need a HTML form now, it's going to be pretty easy to develop a simple one with 3-4 text fields! It's not really about enjoyment though, it's something that I feel is going to better reach our target audience, so it's a necessity to be done.  The trouble with me is when something needs doing I can't really rest until it is done. When you run a business, there is always stuff that needs doing, and I seem to only sleep when I can't keep my eyes open any longer."
advancedentrepreneur,2lh85y,BeadsOfGlory,1 point,Sat Nov 8 17:09:36 2014 UTC,You are right (in regards to removing the link.)  Most of the things I find like that are posted on forums or coding question sites so they aren't fully built out tools but instead snippets of code and they have no back link.

For me I try to shut off completely by gaming, it doesn't happen very often but maybe once a week I will game for an hour or two. The rest of the time I try incredibly hard to get my 7 hours a night. That's exactly what I need to be fully rested. Every morning I'm up at 5 and I try to go to bed for 10 every night. I don't get that all the time but try really hard to schedule a few things in your life like sleep and downtime with friends family as they are incredibly important.

Since then, I've focused on having a better product and the results have been huge.    It all started with a post a long time ago where I asked how other musicians came up with ideas for what to tweet about or post on their facebook pages.  Burried in the responses was a great answer that went something like: ""it sounds to me like your problem is that your band isn't doing anything exciting, not that you can't come up with an idea for your facebook wall post.""  Don't get me wrong, I still do a lot of content marketing, but I don't do things anymore for the purpose of content marketing.  Instead I write better songs or put together better stage shows.  I take pictures of set lists, and videos of the performance or other documentation, and the content I share is far more effective.    edit: I suck at spelling"

The absence of this, IMHO, is what creates the ""garbage tools"", and in your case, also the ""garbage music"", generated solely for the purpose of content itself, driving CTR, follower rates blah blah blah blah.

We do 3 days a week and on call aside from that. I initially offered full time employment but she wasn't interested as she likes to travel so having flexibility in her schedule was important to her. My take is that as long as she can be flexible and work more when needed I can be flexible and let her have the time off she desires.  I bill between 40 and 60 hours a week, to be honest the other stuff was cutting into my family life more than my work life."

I should add that my current assistant is my second as the first one ended up going back to school and it was a good thing for both of us. She was quite a bit younger and not as experienced in life which I would have been willing to work with over time however given the opportunity to try again I made sure to not just pick the first person I thought could do the job.   Our relationship is simple, I ask her nicely to do things and she gets them done. We don't actually have much face time as I am usually onsite at a client during the day when she is getting stuff done."

advancedentrepreneur,2l9rgk,pletentious_asshore,3,Tue Nov 4 19:28:05 2014 UTC,There is an employment agreement that covers most of that stuff but honestly it boils down to having a good feeling about the person and realizing that the worst possible thing that could happen would be identity theft which happens to people all the time who don't have a personal assistant. There is a lot of protection out there for this sort of thing in our financial system already.

Are you in a major city? If someone like that just showed up at my door I'd hire them today!   Sorry I know I said last question but you have me on the precipice of posting a job ad. Was it odd to have someone working for you who was in your house? Were you ever afraid your assistant might steal from you? I think that would take some getting used to. Also, I know you said it was more to free up personal time, but do you think your revenue increased as a result of having an assistant?   I forgot to ask how you pay her - is she an employee, a contractor or do you just pay her in cash?"
advancedentrepreneur,2l9rgk,zirconst,3,Wed Nov 5 06:32:16 2014 UTC,Oh another thing! The Craigslist posting was completely anonymous so I wasn't advertising to the world that I was hiring an assistant. I could have chosen not to respond to anyone if I wanted to back out.

advancedentrepreneur,2l7s1z,biznessman616,5,Tue Nov 4 01:12:54 2014 UTC,"Hey... something that I can directly speak too.  Our companies are in similar industries, about the same age, and have nearly identical headcounts and annual revenue.  What's more, I've spent about $160k this year trying to answer this exact question!  #1: Have you built a book of business that you can hand over to the person you hire?  You're going to have to be okay with handing them existing accounts that they'll collect commissions on.  This will help them learn your business, get familiar with your customers' needs, and not starve while doing it.  Because you're not going to get anyone who's halfway decent who will agree to start from zero.  #2: Are you really sure you need an outside sales team?  This is a really important question.  This year I've simultaneously built out both a sales and marketing org.  This was a mistake.  I should have just did the marketing org first.  A marketing team's job is to craft a brand identity and figure out how to communicate it.  Without that groundwork, your sales team will be lost in the desert.  They won't know who they need to be talking to or have a cohesive message once they do.  This is especially true for a services business where you're not selling prepacked widgets.  I can go on and on about this, but the point is that marketing strategy should almost certainly come before sales strategy for your business.  However, I'll take a shot at your other questions:   How to best locate and identify qualified candidates?   Referrals are going to be the best sources, by far.  Really good salespeople are almost never on the open market precisely because they're really good.    How to go about figuring out initial compensation? (ratio of salary to commission)   Everyone does it differently and there's a whole lot of knobs that can tweaked when creating comp packages.  On the whole though, 40/60 and 60/40 are common base and commission ratios for this industry.   How much runway I should expect to give someone?   This will be dramatically shortened if you have solid marketing in-place first.  I would say 6-12 months without marketing support and 3-6 months with it."
advancedentrepreneur,2l7s1z,Chr0me,4,Tue Nov 4 03:19:05 2014 UTC,"First off, thanks for the detailed response!    1: Have you built a book of business that you can hand over to the person you hire?   I suppose I have but that could be a tough pill to swallow! I suppose as new projects with existing clients arise it would be an easier and slower transition.   2: Are you really sure you need an outside sales team?   Maybe I don't...you've given me something to think about here. I honestly haven't spent much on marketing and maybe that is where my money is best spent at this point.   Oh also, can you clarify with an example what you mean when you say:   40/60 and 60/40 common base and commission ratios for this industry."

Stop by sometime if you're ever in 734-land ;-)   Oh also, can you clarify with an example what you mean when you say: 40/60 and 60/40 common base and commission ratios for this industry.   I mean that base salary is normally 40-60% of a sales rep's total annual comp.  Though this can vary wildly and can get complicated with stuff like draws against future commissions, accelerators, and other bonuses.  The short of it is though: You can't get away with paying a decent salesperson a pittance of a base, even if there's a huge upside opportunity."

I've only been with Amex since May and have an almost combined $80k worth of available credit across all my cards.  And the last time I called, the rep gave me his direct number and told me to personally call him if I ever had any questions.  I really wish I had signed up with them years ago.  I still do like my Chase Ink Bold card though, especially since the points are worth a bit more than Amex's and they have different transfer partners (for diversification purposes).

Simplifying my life has also been a great help. When you have to make major decisions every day, the little ones add up. I'm finding a great deal of relief in eating the same meals at the same restaurants and wearing the same outfits. I've been eating the instant oatmeal cups and instant coffee for breakfast with some fruit. It's a little under $3.00 for breakfast but I don't feel like I'm wasting time, I get calories, and I don't end up starting at 11 or spending even more on Starbucks or some rubbish pastries.  More importantly, while I lost my passion for the product I'm selling I've gained much more passion for the mission of the company and the art of business itself. It's helped me remove significant self-imposed barriers to growth and progress.  There are a few events I attend, such as a monthly entrepreneur poker game, but other than that I've excused myself from almost every responsibility or group not business related."

I ran my brick and mortar store by myself for a year and it was horrible and burn-out was very real. I brought my brother on in the second year, and this year I have managed to step away completely. I think the key to this problem is to approach it from a meta-level: burnout is a common problem if you overwork yourself.   Many many times at work I realize I did too much or worked too hard on the wrong projects. I've had the most success with simplifying everything, and giving myself time off.   Pamper yourself. If you burnout, it is your fault and your loss. You must ingrain into your work schedule RnR on a consistent basis. Force yourself to take time off. This only really works with workaholics but I can tell you are one. Plan consistent time off so you don't get burned out."

This will just add more productive hours to your day.  #3: Rich Hobbies / Rich Social Life. Develops other parts of your brain and helps you focus less on work problems. #4: Mindfulness Mediation.

His didn't pan out, so I pitched him one of the designs I had on the back burner, and he wanted to pursue it.  He's a real estate millionaire and is very aggressive and competent within that field. However, I have no idea whether that will transfer over to marketing awesome pushup handles.   My concern is that he will be negotiating from a position of adding a lot of value through his marketing experience, and then lose interest in doing much of it once the product is launched.   This is going to be more of a side project for him, whereas for me it's going to be very important."
advancedentrepreneur,2l0p75,photoengineer,3,Mon Nov 3 08:02:11 2014 UTC,"Okay. A few things. Some of these you already know but we don't know you know. It doesn't sound like you have nearly enough money.   Nail down the CoGS number. Keep fixed costs and non-CoGS variables separate. What is the minimum production run to get that price point?  Is the packaging already designed? Have you factored in design costs plus the minimums to have packaging made? You can easily have $10,000 into just the packaging to get it down to $1.00 each. Gross Profit is just that, gross profit Does this factor in the cost of shipping the product from the factory and of storage? Are you selling this directly to consumers, online, or to wholesalers? Wholesaling will cut your gross profit to around $5.00 easily so $3-5 for CoGS is too large of a range to have up in the air. This will also be the case if you sell through other channels like personal trainers or Amazon (after competitive pricing and their cut).  Your market freaks me out. I hope you know what you're doing. What is your cost to convert a customer to a buyer if you buy the clicks from Google?   You have no sales and this business is going to take a great deal of time and hustle. How much would it cost you to have someone else do what you've done? (e.g. design, patent, etc). How much time is this person spending on the business? What other skills do you bring to the table and what will you be doing while he's 'marketing'?  If I were him I'd want 50% if I was actually putting time into the business. No less than 40%."
advancedentrepreneur,2l0p75,RiChardge,1 point,Sun Nov 2 02:08:25 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your detailed response.   costs are being nailed down, I'm consulting with multiple plastic companies in my area.   -So far minimum production runs are in the low thousands, on a sort of ""make 'em as you need 'em"" basis. The tools produce parts every 15 seconds or so.   Initial packaging will be using low cost, off the shelf solutions optimized for shipping USPS. Most likely shiny black mylar bags with a product label, with the pushup handles and 3 pages of instructions/workouts folded inside. This keeps shipping cost to a minimum, and also greatly increases startup speed. If the product makes it to stores, a store appropriate package will be designed then.   -As of right now, the plan is to work with companies within driving distance, and store them in the same location where I store products from my other business. Fortunately these handles are quite compact, and so 1000 could fit in the space of a refrigerator.   Initial sales will be online through Shopify, using traffic generated through blogs, youtube reviews, and forums. This is a method I've used well in my other business and I have all of these contacts lined up.    As for myself, I'm bringing pretty much everything to the table except the $. The design is unique and aesthetically pleasing, I named it something catchy, and I have a well thought out initial marketing campaign that I've been refining over the course of several months. And, I've proven to be successful at designing and marketing physical products in the past, as that is what I'm doing full time now.   Basically, it's a turn key product. Once the money is in hand, the key is turned and it's ready for launch. The investor could do things like marketing to help grow the business, but if he chose to do absolutely nothing, the business would continue to run without him and he could just collect his percentage.  Based on that info, what percentage would seem fair for a $20,000 investment if you were a multi-millionaire who was interested in this as a side project?"
advancedentrepreneur,2l0p75,bulgariBLACK,2,Mon Nov 3 08:14:37 2014 UTC,I'd include caveats for adding money if you need it due to unforeseen circumstances. Die defects etc.
advancedentrepreneur,2l0p75,pmpnot,2,Sun Nov 2 03:00:06 2014 UTC,"There are two sides to that strategy. The difference is whether or not you know your numbers. If you are confident on what a reasonable offer is and have the arguments to defend it, YOU should make the first offer. This offer determines the ballpark you'll be playing in. But this does mean you have to know your stuff well.  As you said, however, if there is absolutely no way for him to find out more information / be more confident about his offer than he should try to get the other to make the first bid.   Things to consider: An investor is worth so much more when they have experience in the business and are willing/passionate to help out. Before bringing out any offer, talk to him/her and see what his ideas about contributing are, how much time or expertise/knowledge will he/she bring in? The next thing to keep in mind is that if the investors ends up owning only a little percentage, his motivation to help out will also be minimal. When he's a 50/50 partner, odds are that he will be a lot more motivated to help you out and be dedicated to the cause.  If the investor will stay involved in the company, I would try anything in between 33 and 50% (Also, don't forget to include that if you need to raise new capital in the future and give up percentage for that, who's share will those percentage points come from? Or will he put up the extra money?)  Goodluck!"

As much as I hate QuickBooks I'll need to see some improvements there.  Despite having a business background I still pay an accountant to review my books a few hours per month.

I know this sub is for people with established businesses, but I figured since this is a comment instead of a post it's OK for me to talk about something still in the planning phase.    I know /u/Chr0me is pretty savvy about these things so he may choose to comment on this (and /u/siiiiik already has). First, there is a whole sub /r/churning dedicated to this topic, but IMO the sub isn't very good, but there are some individuals in there who really know their stuff.     TL;DR : YES, USING YOUR CREDIT CARD(S) RESPONSIBLY CAN DRAMATICALLY LOWER THE COSTS OF YOUR BUSINESS OR LIFE. It is absolutely worth getting personal and business credit cards to earn points; I made all my money in 2014 with this, making enough money off credit card cash back to live off of.    So the business Iâll be starting in 2015 is credit card and travel optimization consultation. Most of my friends work in Cincinnati for Fortune 100 companies and are always traveling for work, they've heard how I travel for free with credit card/airline points/miles and they've asked me to do likewise for them.     For example, you would think that if youâre flying Delta and staying at Hyatt hotels then the best credit cards for you would be a Delta and Hyatt co-branded credit card, but this is not necessarily the case. And it is especially not the case when considering their actual personal travel goals, as they want to take their vacations for free.      So the question is what benefits you want: free travel, which will heavily subsidize your businessâs budget, or cash back. Or if you donât do any travel for business then youâll have gained the points to subsidize personal travel expenses.      I know a few things about credit cards and the topic of ""travel hacking"" that the average person can find out by reading blogs for years, and so my service has value because I believe I have an expertise level that takes too long to learn, especially for entrepreneurs who already have their plates full.   As otherâs have commented, they use credit cards to earn 2% cash back; 2% is industry standard, but I shoot for much higher from 4%+ cash back or travel redemption. The higher 8%+ end is what takes a good amount of time to learn.   Sorry for rambling :("

It's my go-to card.  It has unlimited free cards for employees and a nice web portal that can be used to assign individual spending limits.  Chase Ultimate Rewards points are quite valuable.  Unfortunately the Ink Bold is a discontinued product.  Ink Plus (credit card that doesn't have to be paid off each month), is still available though.  I travel pretty frequently and am based in a Delta hub city.  The Delta Amex cards let's me earn SkyMiles that I can redeem for free flights, plus I earn MQMs that allow me to more quickly gain frequent flyer status.  I've earned enough points for about a dozen free round trip, domestic flights this year and will be a Platinum Medallion in 2015 and Diamond in 2016.  The Platinum Amex is an awesome card because of the no credit limit, free Delta lounge access, Global Entry fee credit (which allows you to skip the security line at the airport), $200/yr airline reimbursement credit, concierge service, etc.  The cool thing about all of this is that credit card rewards are considered a rebate and not treated as taxable income by the IRS.
