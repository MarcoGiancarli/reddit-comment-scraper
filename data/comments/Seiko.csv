Seiko,3e1v6u,heytherenowwhat,6,Tue Jul 21 08:55:09 2015 UTC,"Geday,  These movements can do some weird stuff. Did you replace it with a ""W"" battery? That is the high drain version. The ""SW"" is a low drain version. These need the ""W"" battery.  Also, the instructions on the SEIKO website have some reset procedures, try those as well.  As for troubleshooting them, they are a bastard of a movement to work on. I'd recommend just replacing it if simple troubleshooting doesn't work, as in the movement not the watch. I like a challenge, and I've refused to touch them a few times. Once you take the main plate off, it's near impossible to get the tiny gears lined up correctly again, and the labour time spent on it is way more than a replacement movement.

Seiko,3dsl3q,Seikool,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:30:50 2015 UTC,"Beautiful piece! It seems to be sold out most places, where did you pick this up?"
Seiko,3dsl3q,NotProperAttire,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:08:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've noticed that. I can barely find info on this piece myself, seeing as no one has done a review on it. Anyway, I live in the Philippines where there are alot of old stock. This piece was the only one left, and its aesthetic stood out amongst all the new seiko 5 models. The semi skeletonized dial and the quarter-way engraved bezel looks stunning."
Seiko,3dsl3q,theloniousfunkd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:35:27 2015 UTC,That's a very different looking 5.  Love it!
Seiko,3dm5r4,eliindet,2,Fri Jul 17 11:45:53 2015 UTC,"The aspect of threading the nato through the spring bars is very difficult and not recommended for this watch.  The springbars don't leave much room between the case and the bar itself.  I suggest getting a two piece NATO.  The springbars can be installed inside the two piece NATOs.  You get the NATO feel, but it won't be easily removable like NATOs are meant to be."
Seiko,3dm5r4,Wohn_Jick,2,Sun Jul 19 17:35:43 2015 UTC,Some of the better strap combos on the Bullheads I've seen were for 22mm or 24mm straps that the owners would then cut a notch out of to fit the 6138's lug worth (which I believe is 19mm). The is a compromise between the short lug width and need for a girthy strap to frame the big case
Seiko,3dm5r4,squircl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:33:38 2015 UTC,You'll probably have to go with nylon if you want a NATO/Zulu.
Seiko,3dm5r4,sirefauce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:00:28 2015 UTC,I purchased a 20 mm nylon and whoa it did not fit- neither under or over the spring bars. When I forced the spring bar in from over the top of the nato the spring bars popped out- and gasp! once while the watch was on my wrist! I'm considering purchasing a 19mm to see if that works out any better.
Seiko,3dm5r4,rawWwRrr,2,Fri Jul 17 14:04:15 2015 UTC,I'm not positive what the lug width is on the Bullheads but many of Seiko's models from that time period used a 19mm width.

Seiko,3dk6ry,vnyson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:51:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely within normal expectancy. Note that if you don't where for wear until its fully wound it will not last a day, but its up to 40 hours reserve if I'm not mistaken."

Seiko,3db33z,DANNYBOYLOVER,3,Tue Jul 14 22:06:43 2015 UTC,"9.5/10, would pull the same shit. Nice grab."
Seiko,3db33z,D-VO,2,Wed Jul 15 02:42:54 2015 UTC,"*tl;dr * : Planned to buy one watch. Ended up buying 3. Regretting the purchase of two of them because they look just like a Datejust/look exactly alike/been phased out with newer and cheaper versions.  Context: In a previous post I mentioned how I was looking for a nice automatic diver and was torn between a Vostok and a Citizen Eco-Drive. I didn't want to get a Seiko 5 since I already have a SNK809 and wanted to try out a new movement. I saw a guy selling his SNXJ89 for $120 on CL so I figured if I could talk him down to $100 I might as well buy it since it looked pretty much brand new.  He said he'd go for it and also sent me some pictures of the SNKH39/SNXJ89 (top left with Roman Numerals/top right without Roman Numerals) he was trying to sell because he wants to get a Nomos. At first I told him I wasn't interested in these watches because they are small for my taste (they are 36MM and I'm more of a fan of 40MM faces) but to bring them along anyways and I’d see.  BAD FREAKING MISTAKE.  When I saw them in person, I fell absolutely in love. They are just ABSOLUTELY gorgeous. I immediately told him I wanted them and ended up negotiating from $250 to $230 for all three. They are in absolute PRISTINE condition (I almost think he stole them off of a truck or something because it doesn’t look like they are worn at all) but it wasn’t until after I got home that I realized that both are essentially a knockoff of a Rolex Datejust and that they are older models that have been phased out so maybe it wasn’t that good of a deal as he made it sound.  So two questions:   Where does the SNKH39/SNXJ89 fall in terms of Seikos line in terms of movement and quality? Before I decided to buy them I did a quick amazon and google search and it looks like both are discontinued. Essentially I paid $100 for the diver and then $65 each for the two DateJust homages.   I see a lot of newer models that look similar to both but they all have $60 price tags. Am I wrong to feel like I overpaid for a pair of used/phased out watches? Since they look pretty much exactly the same, are there any tips or advice in terms of bands or modifications that would help differentiate them a bit?"
Seiko,3db33z,sad-king-billy,5,Tue Jul 14 22:08:51 2015 UTC,"One Seiko 5 for $100 probably would've been a bad deal, but all three of those, especially the SKX, for $230 is a pretty good deal. Who cares if the Seiko 5 models are being discontinued? There are so many different Seiko 5s that it doesn't really matter. The Datejust clone is actually a pretty desired one so I think you did good."

Seiko,3d62ct,hal0eight,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:19:20 2015 UTC,You'll find what holds the clasp closed is a little metal tang. It's usually just a case of bending that a shade to tighten the locking up. Examine it closely and it should make sense. Then just bend that a tiny amount with pliers and it should be tight again.

Seiko,3cln15,23_vibrators,2,Wed Jul 8 22:10:14 2015 UTC,"IIRC 2.5 is the fat bar diameter, the original Seiko parts are single flanged but double is nicer to take on and off.

Seiko,3cjl3h,iindifferent,3,Wed Jul 8 12:27:54 2015 UTC,"You'll have no problem getting it back and running, with the right repair person.  Worst case scenario the quartz movement is destroyed due to a corroded battery or something, in which case you buy a watch with the same quartz movement off of EBay (0843 will be the movement # if Seiko does the same with quartz movements as they do with mechanical) and have it installed into your Grandfather's watch.  You won't care what a donor watche's case or dial or hands look like (design wise) only that it runs, and can be transplanted into your watch with the same dial, hands and case that your Grandfather walked around with.  A quick search on EBay here in the US just revealed 2 donor watches for <$130 USD."

Seiko,3cjl3h,AZZTASTIC,3,Wed Jul 8 19:00:47 2015 UTC,I think the store is full of shit. You can source parts for older watches in a lot of places. I'd say go look for another shop or find a specialty Seiko repair shop online.

Seiko,3cjl3h,bungsana,2,Wed Jul 8 19:33:17 2015 UTC,"Just went to a different watch store today that sell seiko! They told me they could send it to a company that handles most of the import of Seiko to the country. She believed they would be able to fix it, but it would cost me a couple hundred dollars. They would be able to send it in for an estimate etc. for 50$, which I will do! (everything is expensive in Norway, so the 50$ is not outrageous to me). Hopefully I will have it fixed by the end of August. Really excited haha!  Also, I'm happy you got your watch fixed. It is strange to me that older watches are so complicated to fix, especially considering that trade of vintage watches is fairly common."

Seiko,3by78p,hal0eight,2,Fri Jul 3 14:40:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  It is our fight.  The blackout is already ending, but I am concerned about our ability to run our own subs currently, and the continuing monetization of Reddit.  We've created this sub out of nothing.  It's small, but it is ours, and we made it.  Reddit HQ seems to hold creators, posters, mods etc in near-total contempt.  I'm not sure where this is going, but I don't think it's going to Voat.    I have created JapaneseWatches & Seiko on Snapzu.  I don't know if that's the future, and will hold on here until things go horribly south, but that's one possibility."

Isn't that the business model of most community aggregated sites these days? You need to pay for the huge server farm somewhere, somehow.  As for the other shitstorm, I don't see why a company's HR interactions need to be public knowledge unless there is any wrongdoing, and as yet, after reading a bunch of info, I'm yet to see that. Sure, seems the CEO is a dick and probably a liar/thief, but as the saying goes, poor taste is never illegal. I suspect because the person involved was a girl that really ticks some boxes on the ""geek girl"" card, the neckbeard white knight army has risen up. If it was a dude, you never would have heard much about it.  As for the suppression of free speech, I'm yet to see a subreddit banned that didn't expose Conde Nast/Reddit to legal ramifications, particularly  in the US. So, being a US centric company, you need to operate within the laws of the land. It's the same anywhere. The company is not obligated to provide you with a free speech platform, in no way have they said they were about that. In court, you would lose quickly arguing on that platform.  I dont see VOAT being the next reddit, and they already have a tarnished reputation for a number of the fairly poor taste ""free speech"" subfora they harbour."

So here is a very quick shoot I did for this beautiful diver and I hope to do it a little bit of justice. I will be ordering the 22mm oyster bracelet with solid end links from strapcode in the next few months as the rubber strap on this feels a bit hard and may take a few days to get used to. For those who are curious as to what settings I used for the photos I will post them below! Set up: Backdrop: Dark mousepad. Lighting: Underside of my mouse. Camera: Nokia lumia 920 at F2.0, ISO 100, shutterspeed of 4sec (first picture) and 0.5sec (second picture) And I did a bit of quick retouching on lightroom. Enjoy!"

Seiko,3bccsj,GregEvangelista,2,Sat Jun 27 21:43:38 2015 UTC,What was modified to the SKX in the last picture? I really like what you've done with it.
Seiko,3bccsj,shadow4g5,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:48:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, that one is my current favorite. It's a hodgepodge of parts from different vendors, so this might get a little long.  Bracelet is the Strapcode Super Oyster with their big chamfer clasp.  The bezel ring is the unfortunately hard to get Murphy Manufacturing Coin Edge Bezel. They make them in batches, and unless you're on the waiting list and order immediately after getting an email about it, they'll all be gone.  The bezel insert is Dragonshroud's Planet Ocean Insert which I find to be a higher quality insert than Dagaz. Their's just seem to be more consistent and well finished.  The glass is the CrystalTimes Blue AR Sapphire which I think is the best bang for the buck SKX glass.  And lastly, the chapter ring is the Dagaz Brushed Silver ring, which looks just fantastic in person, especially with the brushed oyster bracelet.  Other than that, the dial and hands are pure SKX, because I wanted to preserve their look, and have the watch be the nicest SKX007 it could be."
Seiko,3bccsj,shadow4g5,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:08:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I'm not a fan of some aspects of the 007. When I have some time I might modify mine a bit"
Seiko,3bccsj,shadow4g5,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"I find it super rewarding. Honestly, with the money I spent on these three guys, I could have bought one or more ""much better"" watches. A Squale or Steinhart being the obvious choices. But there's something to be said about having something that's truly yours, and reflects your own tastes in every regard.  Also, it's really neat when people ask ""what is that watch?!"" And you can reply ""It's a totally custom watch I put together"". It's like there's a whole other level of commitment to the art of watches that goes beyond being able to afford or appreciate something nice.  What is it about the stock SKX that you would want to change? Maybe I can help you get the ball rolling?"
Seiko,3bccsj,shadow4g5,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:00:38 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters I'm not a huge fan of the stock bezel"
Seiko,3bccsj,odi_ous,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:25:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I know that the current batch of Murphy ones went in like a day. It's anyone's guess when they might be around again.  But I recently saw this on eBay, and it piqued my interest. Looks high quality enough to my eyes, if not just a bit expensive. Pop a cool looking insert in there and you're good to go.  As far as more traditional style rings go, I haven't really seen any.  If you haven't looked into how to do the work yet, it's actually pretty easy. Grab the thinnest knife you have and wedge between the case and bezel. From there just pry it off with a bit of torsion.  Inside the bezel ring is a rubber gasket in a groove. Transplant that guy into the new one. There will be a thin metal ring on the case, dont lose that. It's the click ring for the bezel.   Pop the new bezel back onto the case making sure the gasket and click ring are in their proper places the whole time. It'll take some force, so the easiest thing to do is put a book or magazine on a table and push down on the edges of the case with the face of the watch down.  Once its on, twist it right until it locks up. Then apply a thin layer of rubber cement inside the bezel ring, line up the insert, and drop it in. Done! It's like a 15 minute job at most."

Seiko,3bccsj,chasejase,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:37:39 2015 UTC,"Yep. I'd prefer if it didn't, but the bezel gasket provides enough friction that it doesn't tend to move unless you want it to."

Seiko,3bb7hk,mretif,2,Sat Jun 27 15:33:30 2015 UTC,"The movements can be purchased from a couple parts houses, and I personally buy from one in particular.  The biggest issue though is that the crown is a screw-down, and the stems are purpose-built.  The stems do not interchange between 7S and the 4R / 6R movements.  This is a major problem for what would otherwise be a straightforward swap.  There is a hybrid stem assembly made aftermarket in the Philippines that allows for this swap in an SKX-series watch, but like basically everything made in the Philippines, the execution is terrible.  The sprung-loaded screw-down crown has a threaded aperture so that you can swap in other stem types, but it doesn't compress smoothly.  It keeps binding up internally and makes setting / winding the watch damned near impossible."

Seiko,3awlua,beermoneymike,3,Wed Jun 24 14:58:25 2015 UTC,"Why has this post been downvoted twice?  This is a perfectly legitimate question about a significant watch for Seiko, a model created during a watershed event in Japanese history.  This watch, along with the one-button chronograph introduced at the same time, meant that 1964 was the turning point where Seiko went from the old pre-war copycat stuff they made to mimic Swiss output to creating their own unique and superlative designs.  This process continued through the 60s, culminating with the 1969 introduction of the 6138 and 6139 automatic chronographs.  Additionally, this same period saw the creation of the true dive watch, starting with the ""62mas"" 150m dive watch, moving to the slim-case 6105-8000, which moved to the 6105-811x dive watch of ""Apocalypse Now"" fame.  This process paved the way for the fantastic 6309 family of divers, which perfected the functional analog automatic dive watch for that era.  OP's watch is a very significant piece, a serious collectible, and having it serviced is the right and responsible thing to do"
Seiko,3awlua,solzhen,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:39:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment! This has the same basic movement that was used in the 62MAS. It also has the ""Chicago"" outer dial for the US Central Time Zone (instead of Mexico City). Sending you a PM."

It's just a tiny little counter but the guy has a real collection. And he's a very laidback dude, gives off the vibe that he just likes watches and isn't trying to give you the hard sell on anything. http://alltiques.com/  Edit: he doesn't specialize in Seikos or anything. But it's the one place I've found that has offbeat affordable vintage, not just Rolexes and the like. I was very tempted by a Hamilton alarm watch for a few hundred bucks the last time i was in there, for instance.   (A few doors down, there's a watch-supply counter that's also awesome in that old-school NYC way--owner has been there 30 years or something, he spent half an hour fixing some bracelet/endlink stuff for me and ended up just charging me a dollar for a new pin.

Seiko,38q6fa,TheMastaAzn,3,Fri Jun 5 22:07:06 2015 UTC,"Hello and welcome!  I am not super familiar with either of the model series listed in your question, but quick google search shows them to both be ""chronograph"" sports watches with metal bracelets.  Also, they use quartz-powered movements.  Using search terms like those will help you in your shopping.  I hope I'm not overstepping by saying that the majority of users on this sub are into vintage / automatic movements and stuff marketed to Japan (JDM products) rather than newer / quartz movements / American domestic products.  Although I should note that Seiko does make the finest quartz watches money can buy (see Grand Seiko 9F), the SSB and SKS are more ""mass produced"" and not comparable to these.  The r/watches site has a great buying guide where you will find other users recommendations for different styles and price points.  The short answer to your question is that Seiko is a very large watch company and they manufacture a lot of different styles and price points for sale around the globe.  So, in summary, the cliche r/seiko recommendation for the style of watch you want would be like this one, and you will find few people who can speak from experience on owning either model.  Frankly, in the price-range you're looking, Citizen is probably higher regarded for quartz watches.  Their ""eco-drive"" line is also solar powered, extending time until the watch needs to be serviced.  They even offer some models that receive a radio time-reference signal (search for AT8010-58E or CB0020-50E), so they're accurate to the second.  Cool stuff.  Good luck in your search!!"
