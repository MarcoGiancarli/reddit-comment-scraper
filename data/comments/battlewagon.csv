battlewagon,3e44fr,awkwardly_alive,7,Tue Jul 21 20:26:10 2015 UTC,"That depends entirely on what you want to do with it. If you're just looking for the aesthetic, then consider a lightbar and some aux lighting. If you want more durability, look into a skid plate. If you want to get off the beaten path, you'll need the clearance afforded by a lift kit, and probably some offroad tires."
battlewagon,3e44fr,teamwrk,5,Tue Jul 21 21:45:48 2015 UTC,"I just want to add that I never had a problem with ground clearance when driving around on a beach and the track on/off the beach at Bribie. If you're looking at doing some rocky stuff, then ground clearance will help but if you're driving through soft stuff like mud or sand then it's not as big of a factor.  Skid plate is a must if you're going off road at all."
battlewagon,3e44fr,catpirates,4,Wed Jul 22 00:18:21 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point. Terrain is everything, and your build should reflect the environment(s) you'll be exploring."
battlewagon,3e44fr,teamwrk,3,Wed Jul 22 00:40:04 2015 UTC,Ground clearance is always a big factor.  A lift will not only give you more ground clearance but will allow you to install larger tires which will not only soften the ride over rough terrain but will give you better options for aggressive tread patterns.  Plus if you are on sand you want a wide tire.
battlewagon,3e44fr,NeilOMalley,3,Wed Jul 22 01:54:25 2015 UTC,"all I'm saying is that it's not a necessity in my experience in comparison to say a sump guard.   on the beach I prefer road tyres, more tread on the ground to grip instead of just tearing it up.   and by wider do you mean taller/longer/the sidewall? or the actual width of the tyre (first number in a tyre size)? because wider isn't better for sand, it means you're pushing more more sand but not gaining any performance like having a really wide shoe as opposed to a really long shoe."
battlewagon,3e44fr,catpirates,3,Wed Jul 22 02:24:47 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure ""wider"" meant the ""width of the tire,"" though a taller tire will also help to increase your contact patch, especially if you air down with a taller sidewall."
battlewagon,3e44fr,PigSlam,3,Wed Jul 22 03:45:09 2015 UTC,taller tyres definitely help but wider tyres definitely do not help on the sand.
battlewagon,3e44fr,catpirates,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:52:09 2015 UTC,Wider tires definitely help to float on soft terrain be it sand/deep mud/powdery snow.  Tall tires help on hard surfaces as you put more weight on a smaller area for more traction.  In my experience this has always been true and most people would agree.
battlewagon,3e44fr,NeilOMalley,3,Wed Jul 22 05:15:17 2015 UTC,"well two different mechanics, two different tyre workshops and the people I go on the beach with have all told me that a longer foot print is what you need, not a wider one. if you have a wider tyre your drive train has to work harder to turn the wheels but it doesn't propel you any better. the example I have heard is a wide shoe vs a long shoe -- a long shoe isn't going to slip but a wide shoe can.   but YMMV."

battlewagon,3e44fr,NeilOMalley,2,Wed Jul 22 06:05:57 2015 UTC,hahahaha maybe!
battlewagon,3e44fr,catpirates,2,Wed Jul 22 06:20:42 2015 UTC,"Alright, here's the next stupid question: if I'm planning on doing some light offroading, is there some ""best place"" to get skid plates and such? As in, is there some place that is best to buy from?"
battlewagon,3e44fr,teamwrk,2,Wed Jul 22 03:54:52 2015 UTC,"It varies by model, but the manufacturers you'll want to check are Gorilla Offroad, Rally Innovations, and Primitive. There are likely others but those are the three that come to mind and are most often mentioned here.  Skid plates are offered in various thicknesses of aluminum and steel. Steel is a bit heavier, but also more durable. Aluminum should be fine unless you're building a rally car or a rock crawler."
battlewagon,3e44fr,teamwrk,3,Wed Jul 22 04:06:00 2015 UTC,"How important is weight when I'm picking my parts? Does it have any effect on the mileage? (Mileage isn't actually too important to me, but it's still a nice perk with the Subaru). Sorry for all the dumb questions, I'm pretty new to this, but I figured I might as well immerse myself in the community to learn the most I can!"
battlewagon,3e44fr,catpirates,3,Wed Jul 22 04:10:25 2015 UTC,"The fact that you're asking is a sign of intelligence; many people would take the easy way out, assuming or inferring based on their experiences. It's good to ask questions.  Speaking very generally, increasing weight will decrease gas mileage; your engine has to work harder to move the additional weight. To that end, some engineers take the approach of saving every ounce they can-- a bunch of small weight reduction across the entire car will yield a noticeable amount of weight saved.  Speaking specifically about these modifications to a road car (as opposed to say, a formula one car or a WRC rally car) you likely won't notice the difference of a few pounds from a light bar or a skid plate. And I mean you won't be able to tell a difference in the way the car handles. You likely won't notice a change in gas mileage either-- your driving habits have more effect your your fuel economy. The best thing you can do to improve fuel economy is to anticipate the flow of vehicles around you and traffic signals ahead of you: accelerate slowly and smoothly, and you won't have to brake and speed up again once traffic picks back up."

battlewagon,3dl5g2,Sport6,8,Sat Jul 18 21:39:55 2015 UTC,"The FB isn't really mature enough yet in terms of mods/etc. to tell.  It's stronger than the EJ, but strapping a turbo isn't likely much of an option mostly due to space but also because of compression, the gain in power wouldn't be worth it. They do sell supercharger kits IIRC but they are ~$4k or more and also don't give quite the boost you might expect. I know some have fitted it into a BRZ and gotten in the 200s but a 45hp boost for $4,000 is a pretty horrible ROI.  Though I am in a similar boat, an XV would be amazing with more power but at this rate it looks like we'll need to wait until either one is released with more than 155hp or until used ones start popping more on the market in 5-10 years when the option of an EJ or FA swap is possible."

I don't have a basket though, just rhino rack roof racks.   here it is at the beach last time I used it:  http://i.imgur.com/210uB7n.jpg  I love it. it's great for some temporary cover. I have the 2m x 3m one, considered getting 2.5m x 3m but I like how mine fits the roof perfectly.   I got it on eBay:  http://pages.ebay.com/link/?nav=item.view&alt=web&id=121347782563&globalID=EBAY-AU   you can get rooms for them too:  http://pages.ebay.com/link/?nav=item.view&alt=web&id=271637414350&globalID=EBAY-AU   I was going to put a folding bracket on the awning to get more head room to use that with but I have a perfectly good tent -- I don't want to have to take apart my set up just to go for a drive :)"

battlewagon,3d8xno,chrwei,3,Fri Jul 17 19:51:39 2015 UTC,"depends on the car.  several years and models of subaru have bolt-on upgrade options, I'm sure there's others.  you can also sometimes replace the spring with one from a heavier car that happens to have the same size.  sometimes it's as simple as taking the strut and spring from 6 cylinder option and putting it on the 4 cylinder model."
battlewagon,3d8xno,chrwei,2,Tue Jul 14 14:03:44 2015 UTC,"The spring rate isn't so much of an issue as travel is.  Most of the trucks out there have at least 10 inches of travel.  Some have closer to 20.  The Forester has about 6 inches, and the Outback has about 5.5.  I don't mind the harsh landings so much.  Just don't want to constantly break axles and shocks and whatnot when I bounce off the bumpstops."
battlewagon,3d8xno,akzietlow,2,Tue Jul 14 16:33:33 2015 UTC,it's both.  a strong spring will take more force to bottom it out.

It's cheaper to have your own recovery equipment and go with a friend who also has recovery equipment than to rely on a stranger to get you out of trouble.

battlewagon,3d4w6m,SITB10,12,Mon Jul 13 17:03:50 2015 UTC,Scoops like that are commonly used on rally cars to vent fresh air into the cabin. The thing in front of the scoop on the hood is what i'm curious about. It appears to be there to divert air away from the hoodscoop. All of them look glued on and probably do nothing though.
battlewagon,3d4w6m,TheSporkening,5,Mon Jul 13 18:24:29 2015 UTC,The thing in front of the hood looks like a vent to let air from the radiator out quicker/easier...if indeed they are functional.
battlewagon,3d4w6m,les_bijoux,4,Mon Jul 13 19:26:35 2015 UTC,They are indeed!
battlewagon,3d4w6m,gaedikus,3,Mon Jul 13 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"this, and it's to save weight of running an AC system in the car when doing rally.  the M type cowling on the hood (in front of the scoop) is designed to draw air into the engine bay by means of a pressure difference between the air traveling over the hood, and the air in the engine bay  (because fluid dynamics!).   the hood scoop is designed to literally ram air onto the intercooler that would be mounted directly below it."
battlewagon,3d4w6m,Relvnt_to_Yr_Intrsts,3,Mon Jul 13 19:50:38 2015 UTC,I think it's actually supposed to extract air out of the engine bay by drawing a low pressure above it.

The other half of the reason is that it keeps the cabin pressurized, so that all the dust you're kicking up doesn't come in through the door seals and whatnot. It's really difficult to see when the cabin is filled with dust.  You can get actual rally-car-spec ones for $40. Or spend $400 on OEM subaru vents from japan."

It's using lower gears to engine brake, and using the ABS/traction control system to make sure that the car stays under control. The traction control system can overheat your brakes if you let it(aka smelly brakes), but I'm assuming that Subaru did a good job with the programming of it.   I don't have any first hand experience with x-mode."

battlewagon,3d3b1y,Akski,2,Mon Jul 13 04:50:40 2015 UTC,"I know people like them, but they seem unreasonably expensive. Plus unpublished ( as far as I can find) progressive spring rates....."
battlewagon,3d3b1y,Akski,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:27:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah... You're going right over my head with sping compression rates.  All I know is, I don't bottom out on the speed bumps in my neighborhood anymore, the off trail stuff I've done hasn't been disastrous, and she handles a bit better with a trailer.  They certainly were expensive, but the convenience of pre-assembled struts and springs was worth it to me."
battlewagon,3d3b1y,Akski,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Spring rates are simply how much weight it takes to compress a spring one inch (other units can be used as well). So stock forester rates are supposed to be 148 front  and 140 rear. So it takes 148lbs to compress a front spring one inch.  Kings use a progressive rate spring which means that the coils will change from bottom to top. Typically tighter, then further spaced coils of the same thickness. As they compress it compresses the ""lighter"" portion first so that section of the spring acts like a soft spring. For the sake of argument lets call it 125lbs/in. Once that section is compressed you get in to the ""heavier"" part of the spring. I have found that the King lift springs are 185f  and 175r at their heaviest, so a little stiffer than stock.  This setup actually can provide a nice compromise in ride since you get soft springs in easy driving situations, but stiff springs when you have more compression. They are a good choice for a lot of people in a lot of situations. Unfortunately they are also less predictable and harder to load up and control. I prefer the predictability of linear rate springs. They are also easier to pair with shock dampening since you have one rate to match, but a progressive range of rates.  I don't mind custom work and changing springs on an easy car like the Forester is a few hour process at most for me so I am happy to get something cheaper but less convenient and build to my needs."

battlewagon,3d3b1y,JimBob-,2,Tue Jul 14 00:18:51 2015 UTC,"I really like where this is going.  The EG33 is a fantastic motor.  However, one of the problems in making a jack of all trades vehicle is that sometimes you end up with the worst of both worlds.  Stiff suspension is gonna really suck offroad as it ruins you already poor articulation.  What I would suggest is doing like you said and using what you've got with some spacers, and seeing how it does offroad.  If it's awful, experiment with other stuff."

battlewagon,3c86h6,Pizza_The_Hutt,3,Mon Jul 6 00:27:02 2015 UTC,Everything here is spot-on except you should get 03-08 Forester struts. They have a higher spring perch and you can clear bigger tires.

battlewagon,3c86h6,Pizza_The_Hutt,2,Mon Jul 6 03:27:08 2015 UTC,"The limiting factor on the tire size you cna run on these cars is the rear spring perch. The 03-08s are a little bit higher up. I've seen comparison photos on one of the forums somewhere, but I can't recall which one. Either USMB or subaruforester.org. But even guys with SF foresters will swap for SG struts to fit tires.  I'm not sure about your springs on the newer style struts.. You'd have to get the measurements and see if they'd even fit. As I understand it, the struts are the same overall height, so the taller spring perch should mean a shorter spring. But yeah measure it and see if it'll fit. If anything, the older kings should be too long for the new struts, so you could possibly just cut a coil...?  If needed, I can offer a measurement on the 03-08 KYB rear struts. I have a pair sitting in the back of my car waiting to be installed."
battlewagon,3c86h6,AustralianHandstand,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:30:26 2015 UTC,"With the higher perch, but same overall height, wouldn't this shorten the travel slightly?  My tires fit, so I'll probably just stick to what I've been doing for the last 5 years."
battlewagon,3c86h6,Pizza_The_Hutt,2,Mon Jul 6 13:43:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure really. Depends on the compressed and extended height of the assembly. Intuitively, I'd think ""yes,"" but there are a lot of factors that could make it ""No."" Number of turns in the spring, compressed/extended length of the struts, etc.  We need to get someone with experience with both setups to set us straight. All I know for sure is that the SG struts=higher rear spring perch=bigger tires. The total travel differences and other details are outside of my realm of experience."

Also, I'm ditching the stock wheels for the 16"" wheels as mentioned in the original post. I know the wheels with their factory tire size will fit on the unlifted car, but I want to go with some sort of offroad tire that will fit in there too.

HOWEVER it should be noted that the struts have gas inside them under lots of pressure. The only way to do this right is to either only weld the bracket and the spring perch, or to get a strut with removable gas inserts (like the inverted STi struts or some KYB inserts). Welding directly to a gas tube is a good way to have a very bad experience/explosion happen.  You can see in both pictures in that thread that they use removable inserts, and the link that /u/AustralianHandstand posted had blown struts (gas had escaped)."
battlewagon,3btngb,brzcory,2,Thu Jul 2 12:42:21 2015 UTC,"This is true. Weld struts at your own risk, but I have heard of guys welding on struts without issue. You have to do a series of very short welds so that you don't overheat the gas and oil inside. Weld an inch or so then take a break and let it cool. Repeat. I would probably just weld it at the bracket and perch to be safe, though.  It CAN be dangerous, but it CAN be done.  Afterthought: I wonder if you could find some steel pipe that has the same ID as the strut's OD. Then cut in half lengthwise, sleeve the strut with it, weld it to the bracket and perch, and put a few little stitch welds along the length of it?"

battlewagon,3b1nty,rogersam,6,Thu Jun 25 06:28:56 2015 UTC,"I sell these through my work. A push bar or 'nudge' bar generally retains the factory bumper and rises up in the middle of the front of the vehicle. It's smaller and doesn't detract from the overall look of the vehicle. Google it.  A bull bar is generally a much bigger over-bumper guard made from alloy or steel with built in indicator lights and mounting tabs for light bars and other things. It is much heaver and provides the most protection in my opinion. The only downside is that it generally changes the whole look of the front of the vehicle and adds weight. Some of them replace the bumper altogether.  As for a brush guard, I'm unsure. I think that may be similar to a bull bar but made from tubular metal. A great resource is the Australia brand ECB (East coast bullbars) website which will show the differences.  Hope that helps!"

battlewagon,3amc0r,RumorsOFsurF,8,Sun Jun 21 17:22:20 2015 UTC,"Nice! Just remember, since Volvos don't have a limited slip differential, they're essentially one-wheel drive when the going gets awkward, so don't take it anywhere too gnarly!

battlewagon,3amc0r,funkengruven88,6,Sun Jun 21 18:41:14 2015 UTC,so thats why i have single tire fire with burnouts?? still drifts like a boss in the snow tho
battlewagon,3amc0r,funkengruven88,6,Sun Jun 21 18:47:55 2015 UTC,"Yupppp, the moment one wheel has more than about 30% traction than the other, all the power is going to the wheel that's free, not the one that's stuck!    Drifting seems pretty good in a Volvo, but since I don't get snow around here, I've only ever done it on gravel."
battlewagon,3amc0r,terroristteddy,3,Sun Jun 21 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a 240 has the ground clearance to do some decent offroading in dry surfaces, but you're done for if there's mud.

battlewagon,3amc0r,Cyfun06,2,Tue Jul 14 00:53:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, the later turbo models had a factory auto-locking rear diff.  My mom had one, made for some bitchin drifting.  But all the 240s and 940s and whatnot had a Dana 30 rear axle, which is the same as many Jeeps, so one can easily get aftermarket limited slip or lockers.  And with a solid rear axle instead of independent suspension, Volvos are surprisingly good offroad."

You have the dual range and less electrical to worry about, and lots more wheel well room for huge tires without tons of extra work..  Most of the guys in out wheeling group run Gen2s and Gen3s."
battlewagon,3a8beg,dj_dealwithit64,2,Thu Jun 18 04:24:49 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I hear from most people. But the challenges make it more worth while! I'm gonna have to cut my fenders for any decent offroad tires. But my motor is cherry one day it'll be up in the air like these.
battlewagon,3a8beg,dj_dealwithit64,3,Thu Jun 18 04:31:27 2015 UTC,"A 6"" lift with some wheel adapters and high negative offset wheels will let you run 29"" without to much bashing and cutting on Imprezas.  I know a few people who run that.  The other problem is the tires hitting the struts. But the wheels usually help with that"
battlewagon,3a8beg,dj_dealwithit64,2,Thu Jun 18 04:47:02 2015 UTC,"That's about as big as I would ever need to go. I've always heard you start having axle problems if you go higher than 2 inches. As someone with a ridiculous lift, how true is that?"
battlewagon,3a8beg,ShaoLimper,2,Thu Jun 18 04:53:40 2015 UTC,"Well I'm at 2"" over stock.  Meaning my suspension lift is 6"" and the body blocks between all the subframes is 4"".  Even at only 2"" my axles still hit the engine crossmember at full droop.  If you want to be safe do a 1"" over stock.  Unless you are going to be doing some serious offroading you will never miss the extra 1"" of ground clearance."

battlewagon,3a8ao5,503maple,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:04:17 2015 UTC,It probably wont cause any catastrophic failures but it will definitely cause parts to wear faster than stock.  There are some trailing arms mounts you can swap to help move it back in the wheel well.

battlewagon,3a8ao5,NeilOMalley,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:55:50 2015 UTC,"No suspension mods (yet, anyway), actually.  The tires are 215/65R16, as opposed to the Outback's OEM 225/55R17.  They fit, if only just barely, and don't rub at all.  Could be the different tire size or rim size that's causing an optical illusion, or maybe you're forgetting just how high the Outback rides stock, but you're definitely not the first person to comment on that, so there's some sort of wizardry going on there.

battlewagon,3a56kv,musubk,2,Thu Jun 18 12:43:42 2015 UTC,"Subarus are pretty easy. My first time pulling an engine was on a 2002 2.5TS, all by myself with a copy of the factory service manual. I had it out in about 2 hours. Special tools - nothing beyond standard hand tools and a torque wrench, if you're just swapping in a new engine. If you're going to open up your engine and replace all the seals instead you'll need a special torx socket to remove the heads but I think that's it. Don't absolutely need an engine stand, I just set them on a foam pad on the ground.  Every hose you remove, put a piece of tape on both ends and write matching numbers with a sharpie or something, it makes putting everything back together go smoothly."
battlewagon,3a56kv,musubk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:05:33 2015 UTC,You just saved me $100 on an engine stand. Did you use a hoist?  I'm planning on doing this along with taking pictures as I go.
battlewagon,3a56kv,THEMCV,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:25:27 2015 UTC,"I've used a chain hoist hanging from a strong beam in the ceiling and I've used a hydraulic engine hoist that you can roll around. Once it's out 2-3 strong guys could probably lift the engine and move it around, and when it's sitting down it's easy enough for one person to rotate it or roll it a little side to side so you can get access to everything.  Pictures are a good idea. Keep nuts and bolts organized too - plastic sandwich bags work well and you can write on the bag where they came from."

battlewagon,39v96h,BoostBear,3,Mon Jun 15 02:12:57 2015 UTC,A spacer lift and some aggressive tires would help a little.  You won't be able to go to wild without some serious mods.  And yeah a turbo is not ideal for offroad as when crawling you are never spooling the turbo to make power.  Then again I am not sure you will be trail riding.
battlewagon,39v96h,NeilOMalley,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:03:58 2015 UTC,"When you say spacer lift kit are you talking about frame spacers or the ones that go where the top hats of the struts are. Am I okay with stock springs or do I also want to upgrade those, I've read a little on King Springs. Also figure when I tear front bumper up enough I'll just cut it away and mount some front hella 550/700s, not sure how I feel about LED bars heard lots of bad unless I go with something name brand. Oh an skid plates, worth the investment or not really unless I go ape shit off road..."
battlewagon,39v96h,NeilOMalley,2,Mon Jun 15 23:46:56 2015 UTC,"Both actually.  Any spacer lift is just a block between the suspension or suspension and body both.  King springs will give you a bit of lift front the longer springs alone, which I would consider a suspension lift.  Like putting long coils and leafs on a truck.  You could do a spacer and spring combo but then you will need to drop all your subframe to match or atleast so that the suspension lift is no more than 2"" larger than the body lift.  Skid plates are usually a good idea if you are getting into some ruff terrain.  Stock one would be fine if all you are doing is logging roads."
battlewagon,39v96h,AustralianHandstand,2,Tue Jun 16 02:31:34 2015 UTC,"This car will never really be a hardcore wheeler, but I'm sure you know that and did not buy it with that intent! But tires and a little lift will make it go much further."
battlewagon,39v96h,AustralianHandstand,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:00:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to go where jeeps go or anything but I go up to VT/NH a lot and most of the back roads there are gravel or dirt, or covered in snow haha. I'd like to handle those in comfort/confidence and without the need to slow down if a dip comes in the road. I guess I'm more leaning towards a rally wagon then an battle wagon.   From what I read I can't go smaller than 16"" wheels for my car and it's only for certain offsets that will clear the brakes. Are brakes something I would want to also look into or not really seeing as off road you tend to go slower than highway speeds I'd assume? Was looking into Method Wheels but have no real clue on tires other than Geolanders"
battlewagon,39v96h,timtheredd,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:50:29 2015 UTC,"Sounds exactly like you need a small spacer lift (that you can buy from any one of many vendors, or DIY with some HDPE plastic for really cheap), and the tallest Geolander, BF Goodrich, or General Grabber tire you can fit.  The brakes on your car are almost certainly sufficient. Unless you're doing seriously hard braking in a race scenario, your OEM brakes are fine. If you want to, you could upgrade pads, I suppose."

battlewagon,39hxqc,The_Burt,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:05:16 2015 UTC,Mud terrains actually suck in packed snow and ice.  They only do OK if you are in soft snow and air way down.  Also wide tires help float on snow.  All expedition rigs run balloon tires.
battlewagon,39gbqh,BigBadBored,23,Thu Jun 11 15:10:51 2015 UTC,"wow, at level they really should be.  I was in one situation where there was some water, about that much actually, then a flash food rolled in a wave a couple feet high, enough to splash over the hood and lift the car off the road and float into the high-clearance truck behind me.  it also sucked water into the intake and ruined the engine."
battlewagon,39gbqh,chrwei,12,Thu Jun 11 15:19:54 2015 UTC,"This is the biggest thing the average driver is unaware of with water and driving... the intake.  In a lot of cars now, err, at least some cars, they put the intake in the front bumper in front of the tire and it sits quite low and would easily submerge on this road depth.    My STi still scares me to take into anything more than a small puddle and it's a ""rally"" car lol.  (yea I know it's not a rally car)"
battlewagon,39gbqh,IzttzI,5,Thu Jun 11 15:55:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's worse than that.  Driving in deep water, you often form a wave inside the engine compartment.  You can't see it because it's under the hood, so even if your intake is near the top of your engine compartment, water much lower than the intake can still make it there."
battlewagon,39gbqh,PigSlam,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:12:52 2015 UTC,"you know, I've been curious about filling the inside of one's engine compartment with a couple of 1000gph bilge pumps that would quickly blow all the water out as it starts filling up. They're not that expensive."
battlewagon,39gbqh,Relvnt_to_Yr_Intrsts,5,Thu Jun 11 19:51:42 2015 UTC,Some people craft a special intake tube that goes up as high as the roof line.  It's commonly known as a snorkel.
battlewagon,39gbqh,Dirt_Bike_Zero,6,Thu Jun 11 23:20:44 2015 UTC,"yeah but that doesn't keep water out of your cooling fan, alternator, etc.   I'm more interested in Submariner Subaru applications"
battlewagon,39gbqh,Relvnt_to_Yr_Intrsts,2,Fri Jun 12 00:32:16 2015 UTC,"Assuming you don't have CAI then the chances of hydro lock are somewhat less then with it. I run a short ram air intake on my WRX, plenty of clearance when the tides roll in."
battlewagon,39gbqh,slowlywandering,2,Thu Jun 11 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"A normal box will allow water to accumulate in the bottom of it without any getting into the engine. Also, your engine will do fine if it's not getting a ton of water just dumped into it. I've driven cars with hood scoops going directly into the carburetor(through a filter) through some HEAVY rain and it did fine even though it was definitely sucking in some serious water. The CAI will definitely screw you if it gets hit by a big wave, where the box would probably get next to nothing in it."

battlewagon,39gbqh,scuba7183,3,Thu Jun 11 21:17:39 2015 UTC,"Water doesn't need to be very high to carry your vehicle. If the water is moving at a good rate, and is moving perpendicular to your vehicle, it only takes a few inches of water to start moving your vehicle, and clearance ha nothing to do with it. All the water has to do is exert enough force on your tires and you're going for a ride.  Don't get causal with fast-moving water and your vehicle, you can find yourself in a very bad situation VERY quickly."

Heavy rains and poor drainage into the bay coupled with high tide just makes for some fairly deep standing water.

I had to get my rear tyres replaced a couple of months ago and had a chat to him then about upping the profile. I said I would wait til I need to replace all 4 and then put a big set on the front and see how it looks/turns. If I can get away with it I will, especially getting the extra ground clearance without having to do the suspension. I don't need ground clearance now really for beach driving but it would be nice nonetheless."

I drive a manual, always have. have driven other people's autos too.   which would I buy next? probably a manual. if it's just a work car or something auto is cool. it's ultimately personal choice though, I get the impression that driving a manual is a big deal in America whereas it's the norm here in Australia."

battlewagon,38rxmg,Digipete,2,Sat Jun 27 15:47:30 2015 UTC,not sure if you mean clutch starting it? around here jump starting means using jumper leads to help start a car with a flat battery.  clutch starting has definitely got me out of trouble once or twice though!
battlewagon,38rxmg,catpirates,2,Sat Jun 6 11:00:39 2015 UTC,Always called it a roll start. My housemates Landrover had an issue causing a flat battery and instead of jumpstarting it with the 20+ batteries RACT have in their vans he used a tow strap to roll start it.

This is a broad generalization but I feel that if driving is just a way to get somewhere an automatic makes sense, whereas if you are an enthusiast and actually into driving then a manual is usually the way to go. I've never been offroad with an automatic, but I'm definitely skeptical."

Although I have a WRX, and an NA might have a different expeirience."
battlewagon,38rxmg,ReptarSonOfGodzilla,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:33:47 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I never thought about it before but having a manual without a low range or even a creeper gear would be limiting in that regard.

I've been a few situations where I know I could have made it with an Auto, but wasn't willing to ruin my clutch attempting the climb. Torque converter will do a lot of work for you on extreme slopes and at slower speeds. That said, I drive a manual, because the other 98% of the time is way more fun. Rally cross and canyon cruises are just more fun that way."

battlewagon,38rxmg,compmodder,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:21:39 2015 UTC,I've heard that Subaru's awd is more efficient at dividing power in the automatic models
battlewagon,38rxmg,whiskeyfordinner,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:30:04 2015 UTC,I personally prefer an auto. If your on a steep Hill an auto gives you full torque up till the converter locks.  And it's a lot nicer for climbing over things.

battlewagon,38rxmg,Bolmac,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:58:36 2015 UTC,Any particular reasons for this? Because I have always wanted a Subaru outback
battlewagon,38rxmg,whiskeyfordinner,0,Sat Jun 6 20:00:26 2015 UTC,I work on Subaru cars and I just think the automatic is stronger. I bought a 5mt outback and have driven many auto cars identical to mine. The manual is fun but it doesn't have as much pick-up and is harder to control the application of torque. If I didn't have so many hours in my car I would sell it to get an auto
battlewagon,38rxmg,compmodder,2,Sat Jun 6 23:30:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say the opposite simply because you are controlling the shift points. A lot of people who drive manuals never learn to use the upper RPM range effectively, which can leave them with the impression that their car is weaker than it actually is.  For example, if you're cruising along in fifth gear and want to pass, just pushing down on the pedal and leaving it in fifth won't necessarily get you very far. Dropping to fourth can help, but if you know your gear ratios often the best move is to drop it straight to third or even second with some vehicles. Most manual drivers don't have the skills to  know before shifting what gear they need to go to for a specific RPM, whereas with an automatic it drops gears by itself according to how far you open the throttle, so even if you don't know what a gear ratio is you still get the full response simply by flooring it."

battlewagon,3847vn,LsDIsMyHoMeGuRL,10,Mon Jun 1 19:05:32 2015 UTC,Well it all depends on what you want to do with it.  Just look cool and hit the occasional gravel road?  Full blown offroading down trails?  Desert romping?  Each of those will change how you build it.  How much money do you want to spend?  Willing to buy a prebuilt lift kit or do you want to try and do it yourself?  Do you have a shop/tools and the know how to build it?  I would start by reading (don't make a new post just yet) as much as you can over at the USMB Offroad section.  Also if you use Le again ill ban you. ;)
battlewagon,3847vn,NeilOMalley,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:19:22 2015 UTC,"who doesnt want their car to look cool ?! and yeah unfortunately i live in the suburbs of chicago so there isnt much off roading around here, but i know a few spots i can get dirty at. i do have the somewhat know how and the tools. ive looked into lifts already and i know the outbacks have an 1.5' lift compared to my stock struts so thatd nice but 2"" wouldnt hurt ! id like to keep it budget friendly of under $700 hopefully."
battlewagon,3847vn,NeilOMalley,3,Mon Jun 1 20:47:11 2015 UTC,"Well you can either use outback struts and a .5"" spacer or buy a full 2"" kit.  That will get you a little bit bigger tires and a mild aggressive look."
battlewagon,3847vn,NeilOMalley,2,Mon Jun 1 21:05:17 2015 UTC,Are there parameters for each vehicle that tells how big you can go with tires without upgrading axles and such ?
battlewagon,3847vn,NeilOMalley,2,Tue Jun 2 11:59:10 2015 UTC,"Tires don't affect axle wear as much as the lift itself does.  You could put huge tires with zero lift and it won't change the angle of the axle.  But a 2"" lift with even stock tires will.  Also there is not really any upgraded stock style axles that I know of."
battlewagon,3847vn,Babbinated,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"so a 2"" lift with bigger tires will effect the axles? is it a good idea then ? im still a bit confused on whether or not its a good idea"
battlewagon,3847vn,NeilOMalley,2,Tue Jun 2 14:23:41 2015 UTC,"Yes a 2"" lift will make the axles run at a steeper angle than stock.  Lots of people run it like that with little issue.  Just be aware that you will need to keep an eye on the axles."
battlewagon,3847vn,Babbinated,3,Tue Jun 2 14:50:08 2015 UTC,"You can use 2nd generation forester struts and springs for an even bigger lift than the Outback.  It should give you about 3 inches total IIRC.  You can also run a more aggressive tire.  If it's just a base model legacy, then you can upgrade the brakes and the like with parts  from other Subarus."
battlewagon,3847vn,NeilOMalley,3,Mon Jun 1 23:34:38 2015 UTC,"Note that 3"" of lift will put a pretty good strain on axles."
battlewagon,3847vn,Babbinated,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"You could just install the CV shafts from an Outback.  They're longer, so they'll handle the lift better.  You'll still need to watch the axles though, as they won't last quite as long."
battlewagon,3847vn,NeilOMalley,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:10:05 2015 UTC,I'm not sure that they are different.  All the parts numbers are the same between Legacy and Outback.  The difference is the subframe and body spacers/mounts.

battlewagon,3847vn,Pinyon_Puma,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:00:28 2015 UTC,You can even unclip the outside clamp for the boot and push it inward to alleviate some stress.  Lots of us do it that way.
battlewagon,3847vn,NeilOMalley,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:33:40 2015 UTC,This reminds me that I really need to lift my Outback.
battlewagon,3847vn,dirty_mirror,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:55:15 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, the Outback has a 1.5"" body lift along with its strut lift. If you grabbed the subframe, driveline, and suspension mounts from an Outback you'd only have to deal with 1.5"" additional lift from the axle's perspective. I also remember seeing something about using cv boots from Toyota trucks for extra durability (The axle boots wear faster than the joints) but I can't remember where I saw that.  Edit: Outback is a proper noun."
battlewagon,3847vn,bear_with_hair,2,Wed Jun 3 02:18:21 2015 UTC,"You don't need the whole subframe just the spacers.  Also maybe the trailing arm brackets.  I always just recommend 2"" as its pretty safe for people who are new or not willing to put a ton of work in."

IMO, your options are:    Compromise on diesel.  Wait 5 years and try to snag one of the few diesel AWD manual VW Sportwagens that will depreciate to ~15k.  Compromise on the wagon/AWD requirement and get an already imported 4WD SUV like a Landcruiser.   If it were me, I'd do the latter, but I also have a soft spot for those old J70's."

We've been racing Khanacross in it for about 6 months now, it goes quite well for an old wagon often punching well above it's weight.   Khanacross is like rally cross, but there is only one car on the track so you don't need a roll cage or anything so it stays nice and cheap.   The rally tyres were new for this weekend, we drilled some 15"" sunrasira wheels to fit the 4x100 pcd so they would bolt on. The offset was all wrong though so some serious guard modifications needed to be done. Being a pair of prepared professionals, we did this first thing in the morning on race day, just before drivers briefing."

It's a good idea to fix the castor, but it is a bit too much effort for me. It's good to hear you have some plans for it. Lowered 2nd gens look pretty good. Weber carbs are good, but I think they are a bit over rated. If the stock carb is still good, nothing wrong with using that. With it you get a good choke and an anti dieseling valve."

battlewagon,37rn6x,THEMCV,2,Sat May 30 22:34:24 2015 UTC,Body lift blocks on top of the stock struts. $40 total. I have a writeup somewhere on here about it. Ive had mine going for 4 years (i think) and i drive fast on road and haven't had issues off road with anything. Anyone who wants to debate safety with me is welcome but lifting the body of a truck is much more stressful than an impreza on the blocks.
battlewagon,37rn6x,Blazer323,3,Fri May 29 22:28:38 2015 UTC,"Do not do this.  Then again, I would never body lift my truck.  Let alone body lift it with little plastic spacers.

Notice how they do not make 100% contact with the strut top?  That can cause uneven wear and the eventual failing due to stress of the blocks.  How you actually want to achieve the lift is from longer struts or a proper designed lift kit like this.  I think a 2"" kit can be found too and it is made of metal."

Thanks!  Edit:  I found that the forester strut rubs on the inside of the fender.

As lift goes, I haven't done too much research, as I've been more interested in lowering my Outback to Spec-B ride height if anything.

battlewagon,37fpp5,reallifedog,2,Wed May 27 15:56:32 2015 UTC,"The auto box should lock up the front and rear at 50/50 if you pull the fuse for it. I've only had manual Subarus, but the auto actually has some advantage off road for that reason.  You might want to check in to a WRX rear differential. I'm not sure if any have matching ratios, but if they do you could get a viscous limited slip for cheap. It's not an ideal diff for off road work, but would help you keep pushing even with 2 wheels off the ground or get you through some of the tougher traction situations."
battlewagon,37fpp5,3choboomer,2,Thu May 28 00:32:11 2015 UTC,"A WRX diff would be sweet! I believe I run a 4.11, and I know certain year WRX's ran that ratio as well. I have a few other things on the list to take care of first though (like skid plates). Maybe in the future!  I wasn't aware you could pull a fuse to engage the awd, I've read on some forums where guys will actually tie in to the trans. computer wiring and can switch it on demand? I'll have to look into the fuse route though, thanks for the info man!"

What I find is that the pressure and vibration of the wind widen the mounting holes.  I would check all the bolts that secure the fairing to the rack, check the holes for loose-ness. maybe add rubber grommets there.  check to make sure the rubber liner isn't worn, it probably wore a bit, causing some vibration."
battlewagon,37cbud,hondabuilder,1 point,Tue May 26 17:49:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  The rubber liner looked a little worn in some spots but overall I think it's held up decent, would be cheap to replace so worth a shot.  It came with rubber grommets, but perhaps those could stand to be replaced as well.  I didn't remove and inspect the mounting holes so that's a great suggestion.  It seemed a bit loose and after tightening the vibration came on earlier (as in at 60 MPH vs 70 MPH).  I chalked it up to, that's what happens when you mess with it."

If you look farther north into the snowy states there are a lot of them, and they are cheaper.  An automagic might actually be better for a lot of offroad scenarios where you would have to slip the clutch a lot in a manual since these don't have low range.   I wouldn't pay anything for that car.  It needs head gaskets, which is feasible to do yourself but is a major job and a lot of money at a shop/dealer.  The salvage title doesn't make it a bad car, but it makes it impossible to sell.  I'm a little leery that there isn't any pictures of the back half, and I don't know how big of an issue that power steering leak is.  If you know what you're getting into, you could go look at it and shoot him/her a 2000 offer and I would bet that he/she would take it.

Some wagons have the rear seat some don't, you need to check each car to be sure because it was only an option.  Yeah, adults won't have the best time back there as it's pretty cramped, but I have driven around town just fine with 7 adults in my wagon no problem. HOWEVER, I highly recommend getting the stiffer rear spring kit if you plan on doing it on a regular basis, it helps cut bottoming out a LOT. I've killed a few exhaust systems on the current car with bottom-outs, so it's worth investing the extra for the suspension.  I think the funniest thing was when I got pulled over by the cops with 7 adults in the car. They were stupefied as to how we all fit in there and they honestly thought at first that I had suck some lawn seats in the back of the car until they saw it had seatbelts. Then they all laughed and sent us on our way.  I've had a lot of good memories in my Volvos. They might be heavy, uncomfortable and dopey looking, but they just keep on going with heart. It's hard not to love how durable and forgiving they are."

battlewagon,36p3jq,korgothwashere,3,Thu May 21 00:43:05 2015 UTC,"a few things:   seller notes rebuilt engine is an EJ251. this car didnt come with an EJ251 (SOHC), it came with an EJ25D (DOHC). so either the engine longblock was swapped from a newer model (possible but unusual), or seller is parroting bad info from someone else, or just doesnt know what theyre talking about. if the motor is rebuilt, part of that should be new headgaskets. the SOHC was far less prone to head gasket issues as the DOHC, but if its rebuilt it doesnt matter as the new OEM head gaskets are revised over the original 90s gaskets that were most prone to failure all 90s subarus tend to have leaky power steering pumps. the rebuild kit is $25 from the dealer and you can do it yourself fairly easily. they also mentioned a flush which is harder to do at home but worst case you can do the pump rebuild yourself and then have a shop do a fluid flush comes with a lift kit? sweet! looks like a good deal as long as you like the look"

battlewagon,36a44s,Iforgethow,3,Sun May 17 19:30:54 2015 UTC,Didnt do anything to them 2.5 in is max you can lift without messing up the geometry.
battlewagon,36a44s,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sun May 17 19:46:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the Info! How negatively do you feel like it's changed the handling on road? I like the idea of lifting mine but I like being able to fling it around corners etc
battlewagon,36a44s,noNoParts,1 point,Mon May 18 22:41:12 2015 UTC,Well i have no sway bars in it and my rear diff welded and its definitely a different world from when i had my d2 coils on. I really take my time arpund corners and try to avoid the interstates but its still drivable in my books.
battlewagon,36a44s,bear_with_hair,2,Mon May 18 23:47:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you lift.  If suspension only you will change the angle and put a bit more wear on them.  If you also do a body lift and drop the subframes you will keep stock angles but have slightly less ground clearance.  You can usually safely get away with 2"" over stock angles but it will still wear things faster than stock."
battlewagon,36a44s,bear_with_hair,2,Sun May 17 21:30:01 2015 UTC,Nice ride! I love me some Forester.

battlewagon,36affc,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sun May 17 21:51:30 2015 UTC,The only thing is I recently got new tires and went a size bigger.  Stock is 225/60-17 but you can put 235/60-17 on the same rim which gave it a bit more width and height.  It really changed the look of the car!
battlewagon,36affc,NeilOMalley,2,Sun May 17 22:17:23 2015 UTC,Any plans for more?
battlewagon,36affc,SpringerTheNerd,1 point,Sun May 17 22:27:25 2015 UTC,"Not much.  I'm pretty happy with the capabilities so far.    I currently have the plastic brackets off around the fog lights as I'm painting them a flat black (I didn't like the stock silver look).  One side had a drip in the paint so I resanded it but it's been so wet in Colorado lately that I'm waiting for a dry sunny day to finish it.  I'd like to upgrade the fog lights or add a light bar, but not in the immediate future.    Though not really a mod, I have a Yakima rack that I'll put on and load up three bikes on it for a trip to Moab with friends soon.  When biking by myself I just put the bike in the back."
battlewagon,36affc,SpringerTheNerd,2,Sun May 17 22:40:39 2015 UTC,2010? I have a 2010 2.5i. Its fun but I really wish I got an older outback instead
battlewagon,36affc,SpringerTheNerd,1 point,Thu May 21 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"Yep 2010.  Mine is the limited trim, but I find myself jealous of the older XT's as well.  Could have gotten one of those cheaper too yet.  Still - I can't complain about the improved fuel economy and cargo room. :)"
battlewagon,36af21,harry_hotspur,2,Sun May 17 19:20:22 2015 UTC,Well if you have very little mechanical experience then you will want to go slow.  Subarus are plentiful and relatively easy to work on compared to other wagons.  Find a cheap 90-96 Legacy wagon.  Put some outback suspension under it and some larger tires and go from there.  You won't be able to go anywhere but it would be a decent start.
battlewagon,36af21,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sun May 17 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"If you are new to wrenching, I would say the older the better. The cars are cheap, parts are cheap, and they are easy to work on. Not needing it as a daily driver is good, so you can do bigger projects on it and not worry about having it ready in time. I would say 2nd or 3rd gen Leone/Loyale, as they have 4WD and low range."
battlewagon,367m68,DukeSpraynard,13,Sat May 16 23:09:46 2015 UTC,Question.... Whats the point of a battlewagon over an SUV if you put 3 feet of accessories above it? lol
battlewagon,367m68,Doctorphate,7,Sun May 17 00:56:14 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it's either brand loyalty, a penchant for the absurd, or a preference for symmetrical AWD."
battlewagon,367m68,praxeologue,5,Sun May 17 01:04:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think this one has AWD, the mod list just says 5 speed DR."
battlewagon,367m68,JP147,4,Sun May 17 02:26:37 2015 UTC,This is correct.  EJ22 with a 5-speed Dual Range.
battlewagon,367m68,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sun May 17 02:39:15 2015 UTC,"I do know of some people who use a dual range full time 4WD, and there is a guy who made a custom trans with a dual range Liberty 5 speed, lowest low range and a centre diff lock. But it seems like a lot of effort just to get AWD."
battlewagon,367m68,JP147,3,Sun May 17 02:50:32 2015 UTC,The dual range full time transmissions for these cars is a 3.7 while the regular dual range is a 3.9.  Not very good for offroad.  And I believe you can take the low range out of a EA82 DR and swap it into the EJ DR and make a hybrid with a lower low gear set.  Yes lots of work but I guess people enjoy the challenge.
battlewagon,367m68,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sun May 17 03:14:55 2015 UTC,"As for the latter, front and rear lockers."
battlewagon,367m68,Doctorphate,2,Sun May 17 01:07:49 2015 UTC,No lockers in Subaru's.
battlewagon,367m68,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sun May 17 02:39:37 2015 UTC,"I understand that, I was saying instead of the AWD, just run lockers."
battlewagon,367m68,Doctorphate,3,Sun May 17 02:47:16 2015 UTC,Yeah but lockers cost money.  Plus its fun to be different.
battlewagon,367m68,NeilOMalley,4,Sun May 17 03:12:07 2015 UTC,probably personal preference.
battlewagon,367m68,sabbacabbage,3,Sun May 17 01:04:07 2015 UTC,I was looking at getting an L Series but instead got my ute. My reason was because they're cheap and modifications are easier. Even with all those modifications that thing would still be light as fuck in comparison to a suv. Also they're awesome as shit so preference is a big thing.
battlewagon,367m68,AusOffroader,3,Sun May 17 05:54:48 2015 UTC,Gen3 wagons are pretty small and can get into some tight spaces.  Also they are way cheaper than say a 4 Runner or Jeep.
battlewagon,367m68,NeilOMalley,2,Sun May 17 02:40:35 2015 UTC,Jeep Cherokee would be very cheap and small.
battlewagon,367m68,Doctorphate,5,Sun May 17 02:46:52 2015 UTC,L series are cheap as shit here. We got one for $300 with rego. Never seen a going Cherokee for that price that isn't a wreck.

battlewagon,367m68,Doctorphate,2,Sun May 17 12:36:22 2015 UTC,"Yes. That is no doubt the reason why we find them so cheap. You wouldn't believe the nasty, nasty things we did to that poor Subbie."
battlewagon,367m68,AusOffroader,1 point,Sun May 17 12:39:48 2015 UTC,"yeah, here Subi's are expensive and Cherokees are dirt cheap."

battlewagon,367m68,NeilOMalley,2,Sun May 17 22:26:52 2015 UTC,There is no SUV that can replace a 4WD Subaru wagon.
battlewagon,367m68,JP147,3,Sun May 17 02:29:53 2015 UTC,Jeep Cherokee.
battlewagon,367m68,Doctorphate,5,Sun May 17 02:47:29 2015 UTC,"The Cherokee might be a better offroader overall, but it doesn't replace a Subaru 4WD. Depending on the model, Cherokees weight 1.5 to 2 times as much, don't have full independant suspension, don't get the same fuel economy, are more expensive to maintain, etc.. New Cherokees might be different, but they cost 20 times as much as an old Subaru with similar offroad ability. I use a Subaru because it is a 4WD as well as a Japanese compact car, making it reliable, cheap and practical. A lot of people might do it for the novelty though."
battlewagon,367m68,JP147,3,Sun May 17 03:03:30 2015 UTC,I'm not sure where you got your info but its extremely incorrect. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep_Cherokee_(XJ) - 3300lbs - extremely cheap to maintain - 20mpg when fully loaded - solid axles would be a positive for reliability as there are less parts to go wrong.
battlewagon,367m68,Doctorphate,2,Sun May 17 03:27:13 2015 UTC,"A Subaru 4WD is 2,000-2,300lbs depending on the generation   Nothing is cheaper to maintain than a 1980s Jap car   I don't know imperial measurements too well but an EA81 with a Weber carb should get at least 30mpg if not more   Solid axles are generally better, but it is not Subaru.     One day I will probably build a ""proper"" 4WD that is far superior off road, but it doesn't replace a Subaru."

battlewagon,367m68,JP147,7,Sun May 17 04:18:42 2015 UTC,"It is 1.43 time heavier, looking at a heavy Subaru and a light Cherokee.   It might be different in America, but as a mechanic I can guarentee that on average, 80's Japanese parts are the cheapest by far.  Running overly rich with a blocked air bleed, the worst my car has ever got was 25mpg city driving. I am yet to get enough results since cleaning the carb and retuning.   A Jeep is clearly superior. Solid axles, lower gearing, more torque, better upgrades, tougher components, etc., but it is not in the same class as a Subaru therefore not a replacement."

If you get stopped with that here in Norway you wont be able to drive further before you take it off."

battlewagon,367m68,Evoraist,2,Sun May 17 17:49:17 2015 UTC,I would love to have that lift on my wagon.
battlewagon,367m68,kstorm88,1 point,Sun May 17 03:36:58 2015 UTC,Does that car have a lift were the driveline angles don't change and it's just a body lift? It doesn't look like it's gaining much especially running those smallish tires.
battlewagon,367m68,NeilOMalley,2,Sun May 17 12:51:15 2015 UTC,"Looks like a full 6"" suspension and body lift so the axle angles will remain stock.  He had a 4"" before with the 27"" tires.  I'm sure he might be getting something bigger.  I will have to ask him his plans next time I see him."

battlewagon,367m68,kstorm88,1 point,Sun May 17 17:50:52 2015 UTC,"I have a 2.5"" lift with 1/2"" plates under the cross member. The radius rods are not lowered and they are a bitch to reconnect haha! Rear is at 2.25 with nothing else changed. I feel like I'm at the absolute max lift you can go without adding major stuff. As far as I know, you can only drop the front cross member 1/2"" without lengthening the stearing shaft and and lowering the tranny"
battlewagon,367m68,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sun May 17 22:24:25 2015 UTC,Yeah but dropping all that stuff is pretty easy along with extending the steering.  But since you run stock tires I guess it doesn't matter.

battlewagon,366u0y,chr155,5,Sat May 16 18:51:00 2015 UTC,"the first thing you need to answer is what do you want to do with this car? do you want to take it mudding, on sand, or just on the grass sometimes and through puddles?  because you can drop a lot of cash into a car for not much use, or you can drop a little cash into purpose picked upgrades/mods and go from there."

battlewagon,366u0y,catpirates,2,Mon May 18 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"lifting it is only really good if it's going to be loaded up really heavy and not really necessary for what you say the purpose of the vehicle is.   as someone who does a fair amount of off roading on sand and dirt I can tell you now that you don't need a lift kit. you also don't need expensive tyres to do basic tracks or cuttings.   but if you or your friend wants to drop a bunch of cash into a car and not get it back and you have money to throw around, do whatever makes you happy. speaking from experience, you have to know the limitations of the forester before you start going crazy on upgrades and mods."

battlewagon,360i93,Megarhurtz,-2,Fri May 15 12:34:46 2015 UTC,Is it?  Or is it about badass wagons?
battlewagon,360i93,thescrapplekid,7,Fri May 15 17:24:17 2015 UTC,It was originally a sub more focused on offroading using subarus and other small wagons. Street modified rather than offroad modified vehicles were generally turned away.   If the mods want to shift their focus to be more broad that's fine.

battlewagon,360v6i,musubk,6,Fri May 15 03:43:27 2015 UTC,"You want to check for rust.  They are prone to rust in the bed, rockers, wheel wells and t-tops.  The EA81 engines are pretty robust but need valve adjustments.  They have a 4 speed with a dual range.  Lifts are available but the axles are fragile.  No lockers available and you can swap in an LSD from a turbo GL or RX but they won't be much use off road."
battlewagon,360v6i,NeilOMalley,1 point,Fri May 15 05:49:16 2015 UTC,"I will be sure to check for rust. I mostly just want to get it running well and put a good set of tires and some skidplates under it, I think that'll be enough to start with. I figure it's going to take at least a mild lift to fit tires though."
battlewagon,360v6i,JP147,3,Fri May 15 08:43:19 2015 UTC,"It's a Gen 2, 84 or 86"
battlewagon,360v6i,JP147,3,Fri May 15 03:58:46 2015 UTC,"Older Subarus are the best ones, they have real 4WD and low range. They are easy to lift and put good tyres on. Here is my 2nd gen, I did a 2"" lift in a weekend and it only cost a few hundred. Bigger lifts take a bit more work. A 2"" lift can easily clear 27"" tyres, the front guards might need a little trim though. The rear torsion bars are height adjustable by turning an adjusting screw, they can also be removed and turned to any height you may want. A lift kit is better for driveshaft angles though. In Australia, 14"" wheels are easy to get in 4x140 stud pattern, but I am not sure about other countries. There were Detroit style lockers made for them, but not many. You probably won't find someone willing to sell one, and it would cost more than the car. I know of a lot of people who use rear LSDs, but I haven't really looked into how effective they are."
battlewagon,360v6i,AustralianHandstand,1 point,Fri May 15 08:38:08 2015 UTC,"How did you do the lift if you don't mind? A kit? My first priority after getting it running well is to get some good tires under it. I'm not necessarily after a crazy lift but I figure it'll need a little just to fit tires. Sounds like 2 inches would be enough.  I was googling Brats earlier and found a guy who just drilled the hubs out and banged studs in to fit a 6 lug Toyota pickup wheel, which are fairly cheap and easy to find in 14 and 15 inch sizes."
battlewagon,360v6i,justforlurking,3,Fri May 15 08:47:13 2015 UTC,"Blocks under everything basically. Here is the kit, I bought it second hand.  This one has modified pieces for the radius rods and sway bar to mount, some might just use blocks. You need to use spacers on the front stuts, at the engine cossmember, the rear shocks, the rear torsion bar assembly, diff mounts and sway bar/radius rod/gear box mount. I also put a washer where the 4WD linkage starts under the shifter as the gear stick hit it and made it hard to select reverse. I still need to take it out of low range to select reverse, but once it is in reverse I can put it back in low and this is not a problem for me. I didn't extend the front brake hoses, instead I wrapped and cable tied a slightly larger piece of hose around them where they would rub on the strut, and cable tied them so they wouldn't rub. I did need to take the rear brake hoses out of their mounts on the trailing arms and hammer the mounts down. This meant I didn't have to extend any brake hoses. My stock bash plate still fit, but you might need to file the holes out a little bit.  It is the same stuff for all 2nd gens. I didn't end up using the extended steering shaft in the picture, I used this steering shaft extender (the silver block) with the standard shaft. Using 6 lug wheels seems common in other countries, or Peugeot steelies. Here is a guide on how to make the standard hubs to 6 stud: http://offroadingsubarus.com/subaru-6-stud-conversion/."
battlewagon,360v6i,NeilOMalley,2,Fri May 15 09:09:37 2015 UTC,"If you have any fabrication skills, making your own lift is easy and so is installation. If you have no fabrication skills, but you have a sawzall and a drill, you can make a 2"" kit VERY easily. As others have said, a 2 inch lift will clear 27s. I think my 2 inch lift took me less than a day to build and install.  You will almost certainly have to do a 6 lug conversion to get anything bigger than the 13 inch wheels. 14s and 15s exist, but they are impossible to find, so just forget it. The 6 lug conversion is, again, simple if you can use a drill and a hammer. then you just bolt up any 14 or 15 inch toyota truck wheel (6x5.5"" bolt pattern)  Lockers are not really an option. There are some LSDs but they are expensive and rare. You are better off to just weld the rear diff. Because these cars are FWD without the 4WD engaged, you can weld the rear diff and just take a CV axle out when you drive on the road. With a little practice, you can install or remove a rear axle in a few minutes.  Go to ultimatesubaru.org and check out all the sticky posts in the offroad section. It will answer any question you ever had."
battlewagon,360v6i,justforlurking,1 point,Fri May 15 17:31:00 2015 UTC,"I've done some minor fabrication before, just nothing like a lift kit, so the daunting thing about it to me is just figuring out what I need to make.

They're neat cars and don't need modification to be fun. Apparently the EA82 takes a lift better if you are determined to go in that direction."
battlewagon,360v6i,justforlurking,3,Fri May 15 18:09:07 2015 UTC,Gen2 axles are pretty weak.  Thats why you always do a full lift on suspension and body.

battlewagon,3508s6,THEMCV,4,Wed May 6 03:04:27 2015 UTC,Third crossbar? I like that idea.
battlewagon,3508s6,hoon_,3,Wed May 6 03:15:06 2015 UTC,"At the sake of sounding like a negative Nancy... the roof rack - or right above your windshield is really not an ideal spot for a light bar. If you're ever off road and any bit of dust kicks up,  the light can create an environment that's tough to see through. Ever turn on your high beams in fog?   Kinda the same idea.   Plenty of other,  potentially more effective locations to mount a light.   I debated the same thing for my roof basket until I rode in my buddy's Wrangler with a light bar and even on the road, the bugs and small flurries of dust made it more of a hindrance than otherwise."
battlewagon,3508s6,boom_bap,3,Wed May 6 03:52:14 2015 UTC,That makes complete sense. I planned on mounting some driving lights (possibly hella black magics) at grill height as well. I figured the top bar would be good for lighting up a campsite and juat looking cool.

I will probably go with a reputable brand for the next small bar for the grill  though..    Edit- I hear you on getting what you pay for..  My AUX lights get used so infrequently and they are really just there mostly for looks, that I don't need to go top tier on them..  The nice stuff is nice, but not needed in my application..  On my dual sport bike I had, yes I only ran the best stuff, Baja Designs dual sport kit and lights..  If you lost a light while skipping along on that thing, it was bad news.  But my car still has a functional set of headlights  and a good set of Rigid industries Duallys to fall back on should my $50 light bar fail ever.    My justification in the mater was I paid $50 for the lightbar and granted I had to wire a relay myself and source my one wiring and switch,  I would not get 20x more enjoyment out of a top tier bar than this one..  I would have loved to bought a name brand, but it came down to having a cheap one, or not having one at all..  But I absolutely get you saying to get good stuff!"

battlewagon,34nt4p,Rat_Raze,2,Sun May 3 05:51:36 2015 UTC,The wheel position is caused by doing a spring or block lift in the rear without dropping the rear trailing arm brackets.  It makes the wheel swing down and toward the wheel well.

battlewagon,34jatz,JP147,1 point,Fri May 1 22:29:35 2015 UTC,Earlier 3rd gens came with low range so it should be a very simple swap.

battlewagon,34jatz,JP147,1 point,Fri May 1 23:57:15 2015 UTC,"Yours is a 3rd gen, and most I have seen are dual range. If I was doing it, I would find someone selling parts or go to a self serve junk yard and just get all the bits you need. There might be different splines on some transmissions, but it shouldn't be too much of a problem. I get my info from Ausubaru but you are probably better off going on the Ultimate Subaru Message Board forums."
battlewagon,34jatz,iminyourtoaster,1 point,Sat May 2 00:04:29 2015 UTC,Well if a 92 is a 3rd gen maybe I already have dual range. Is there something to look for?
battlewagon,34jatz,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sat May 2 00:23:21 2015 UTC,"I think the dual range was only on 85-90 Loyales. If you have it, the 4WD lever has 3 positions (FWD, 4WD, 4WD LO) and a light will come on the dash when it is selected."

battlewagon,34jatz,JP147,1 point,Sat May 2 01:32:22 2015 UTC,"Is yours an auto? If it is, gear ratios are less of a problem because the torque converter will give you low ratios. Still worth swapping a 5 speed dual range eventually, the old autos boxes are not quite as strong or reliable. You don't need to do anything with the rear diff if you swap in a 5 speed dual range transmission, front and rear diffs should have the same ratio if you stick with 3rd gen parts. Subarus are a bit different to conventional 4wds, as they don't have a transfer case. The low range gears are on the transmission input shaft, and selecting 4wd engages a dog which connects the rear driveshaft to the rear of the layshaft."

battlewagon,34jatz,NeilOMalley,1 point,Fri May 1 21:36:57 2015 UTC,Well they don't make lockers for Subaru's.  Your only option would be to weld the rear diff.  It makes a huge difference but wears your tires and axles faster on pavement.  EJ swaps are very do able.  I am working on one now.  The wire harness cut down can be a pain but the Ultimate Subaru Message Board has lots of info and guides.
battlewagon,34l1f4,KingOfRakes,5,Sat May 2 02:16:31 2015 UTC,"My EJ22 had blown headgaskets.  I didn't know because of how the closed deck system works.  In non-closed deck engines, when there's a headgasket failure, you normally see coolant in the oil.    On my EJ22 I would get the bubbling when I looked at it, but it would only overheat when completely stopped.  Temps were normal at freeway speed but as soon as I stopped the temp would skyrocket.  I'd always check the overflow and it was always overflow.    Fast forward to out in the desert one weekend, car was overheating at low speed.  I hauled ass over to the gas station that was 20mins away.  Let the car cool off, checked the overflow and it was the usual at-the-brim.  Checked the radiator:  completely empty.  The time it took to fill my radiator while 100 miles from home felt like an eternity.  It was completely empty.  I was able to get home and do some basic city driving, but it was known now... the headgaskets had to be replaced.  You need new head gaskets.  I'd replace the thermostat, water pump and timing belt while you're at it.  I've had my motor completely rebuilt now and everything has been working great for the last 2 years.  Everything had been working great, then when I was on the freeway for a few hours and stopped to piss, the temp shot up like it used to.  I jumped back in the car and took off and temps were normal.  Cause this time?  My radiator is completely caked in dirt/mud."
battlewagon,34l1f4,Pizza_The_Hutt,4,Sat May 2 04:09:31 2015 UTC,"If you're seeing bubbles in the coolant a simplified leakdown test would quickly confirm that it's the head gasket and tell you which cylinder(s) are the problem. Basically you remove all the spark plugs, and one at a time for each cylinder rotate the crankshaft until the cylinder is at TDC. With an adapter for the spark plug hole you hook a hose from an air compressor up to the cylinder. If there is a leak between the cylinder and a coolant passage it will be evident by bubbling in the overflow."
battlewagon,34l1f4,Bolmac,3,Sat May 2 18:15:45 2015 UTC,"Don't waist your time on changing the coolant, go buy a cheap compression test setup. Find out if you have a problem first, changing the coolant will do nothing if you have a blown head gasket."

Flushed the radiator, changed around some of the older decrepit hoses, and are planning on filling it back up.  Now about the compression test, how would I  gain access to the spark plugs? I know where they are located, but are there any tricks to it which would save time?"

battlewagon,34gf70,Cyfun06,2,Fri May 1 05:13:16 2015 UTC,"Might I ask why you chose a Baja over a wagon or sedan?  What cracks me up about the Baja is that the bed in my '79 Brat is pretty much the tiniest pickup bed ever, but the Baja's is actually smaller.  I'm not exactly sure what good a Baja is if you can't even fit a motorcycle in the back.  You could throw a bicycle back there, but then again, you could throw one in the back of a regular wagon, as well."
battlewagon,34gf70,Vroonkle,6,Fri May 1 02:21:19 2015 UTC,"You CAN fit a motorcycle in the back.   I've owned wagons, and now I own a Baja. I'd never fill the back of a wagon with dirt, bark dust, gravel, etc. All things that go in a truck bed. Also, you're not limited on vertical height. You can definitely fit a bike in a Baja just like you can fit a bike in a wagon, however you can fit a bike for every passenger in a baja (2 on the roof and 2 standing in the bed) while putting a bike in a wagon usually costs you your back seat. Also, the Baja has 6"" more backseat space than all the other Subarus marketed during the same time frame. For tall guys like me that makes the seat behind the driver usable again. It's a rare niche that the Baja fills, but when you need one it really checks all the boxes nicely."

battlewagon,34earm,whiskeyfordinner,2,Thu Apr 30 13:32:33 2015 UTC,And if its not the same?  Sorry Im still a Noob when it comes to suspension pieces
battlewagon,34earm,whiskeyfordinner,3,Thu Apr 30 14:27:08 2015 UTC,You will need to compress the spring and remove the top caps from you old unit. Check to make sure the spring seat sizes are the same. Then reinstall your old caps to your new assembly. Make sure to clock the caps the same way they came off.
battlewagon,34earm,musubk,2,Thu Apr 30 15:39:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info but what exactly do you mean by clocking the caps?  Never heard of that before
battlewagon,34earm,slotard,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"I assume they mean rotating the caps so the bolts line up. If you save torquing the caps down until after install you won't need to worry about this. Just tighten the nut down a little to hold the cap on, bolt the caps in place, rotate the strut so the lower mount lines up and bolt that in, then torque the caps down from inside the engine compartment."
battlewagon,34earm,slotard,2,Tue May 5 04:50:12 2015 UTC,"I believe the rear on that generation is multi-link with shocks rather than struts.   I'm pretty sure everything will bolt up. I wouldn't use any extra spacers on top, you don't want to get your CV angles too extreme (the Outback lowers the powertrain relative to the body to improve angles, but this gives up some ground clearance)."
battlewagon,34earm,KoshekhTheCat,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:25:56 2015 UTC,I've heard a lot of people saying the rear is the hardest to install is that true?  Also how much ground clearance should I expect with just the New assembly no extras

Next time, I'll bring a USGS topo map and make the whole approach from the north. Will probably be easier when it's dry, too.  Turned around and approached it from the south by the river, and drove all the way through the canyon to the wash, tooled up the wash a bit, and turned around and headed back out south!

Basically I am looking for a jack to use on the side of the road/off road conditions or just maybe a better location to jack it up. Even for just a tire change I am sort of paranoid on using something other than the jack to just hold it up which is why I use the pinch weld near the tire for a jack stand.

I also got a spare 215/75/R15 tire off of craigslist...so, full sized spare!  Anyways, I have a tire mounted up on the rim. getting pretty close now, just curious about the questions in the main post."
battlewagon,33kpvx,JP147,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:45:20 2015 UTC,"The plastic fender liner is not important for me, but it may be more important on a modern vehicle like yours. If your air intake is in the wheel well, you should relocate it so the wheel is not throwing mud and water straight into the air box. Make sure the wiring is out of harms way and cover any connectors you can see there with electrical tape. Other than that, it should be fine.    I wouldn't care so much about front fenders. They are there to get destroyed and are easy to replace. I fix my rust by just wire brushing off any loose flakes and spraying some Killrust or similar paint on the rusted area. This sort of paint is made for things like boat trailers, anchors, things like that. You can use it on a rusted surface without any preperation and it prevents further rust. Rust in fenders is easy to see and easy to access, so you can treat it as soon as it appears. If you are going to use flairs, make sure everything is well sealed and painted and take them off every now and then if you live somewhere salty (especially the rears).    Flares like this can be bought in a roll for cheap from an auto shop or a rubber shop."

battlewagon,33anlb,Kurly_Q,4,Mon Apr 20 23:53:16 2015 UTC,Did they say where they were rubbing at?  From that thread it looks like they fit on fine. You might want to have your tires put on the rims (if they aren't already) and just cut/roll where you need.
battlewagon,33anlb,THEMCV,5,Tue Apr 21 00:04:37 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm....I wish I had a 15"" rim laying around. The issue is that it's my daily, and I only have one set of rims. They didn't specify exactly where the rubbing was, and when I asked, they just said it wouldn't fit in the wheel well. When I put the tire next to the current mounted tires, it does admittedly look closer than I had originally thought, but not awful once it's past the fenders.  Anyways, they took the bigger tires off the rims and I headed home on the current tires, because they said it would be ""undriveable"" with the bigger tires at the current state.   maybe I'll just put the tire next to the current ones and guesstimate it out. I think that's my best bet.  I would like to avoid cutting the wheel well, but I'm perfectly happy rolling the hell out of my fenders and bashing things with a hammer. I don't even have to worry too much about the paint, because it's already pretty wrecked. :D"

battlewagon,33anlb,onimitsu,2,Wed Apr 22 00:43:00 2015 UTC,I've already added the trailing arm brackets. They were painfully nondescript on where it was rubbing. I have some ideas for where to hit things though!
battlewagon,33anlb,LittlePe0ple,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:26:56 2015 UTC,"If you've got a spare rim, get it mounted and try test fitting it yourself. My only thought is that their is some minor changes in the struts in some years, and clearance to the perchspring might be too tight. I had to get my front right swapped out because it was from a different year and had about a 1/2'' lower perch. The rears can also be a problem if you don't make spacers, when my are fully flexed, they rub slightly, and the shop probably won't install if they're touching."

battlewagon,32x796,Cyfun06,4,Fri Apr 17 13:44:57 2015 UTC,"That's one gorgeous photo for having an off.  Almost wallpaper material.  Dunno if it affected you any, but throwing big wheels and tires on an ancient Japanese car that already has shitty brakes is always iffy.  In the future, you might wanna invest in some high-quality pads, and ensure your master, slave, and brake lines are all in good shape, as well as bleeding your brake fluid every year."
battlewagon,32x796,loki_racer,6,Fri Apr 17 17:19:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks! If you like that one, here's another shot while I was waiting for the 4WD to show up.  Mine has stock tire size still and I redid the front brakes with decent-quality parts a year or so ago. Last week the car started pulling to the right a bit when stopping. I figured this was the right rear wheel cylinder losing pressure to the left front/right rear part of the system but I didn't have any fluid leaking back there and my reservoir never depleted so I figured I'd change the master cylinder on the next sunny day. The pull was pretty slight and I had no trouble stopping on dry pavement (it wasn't raining then!) so I didn't consider it an emergency problem.  That was dumb and I should have immediately fixed the issue. I couldn't slow down approaching the curve where this happened. When I'd brake the front right tire would just lock without losing any momentum. It didn't feel like the front left tire was getting any brake action at all. I don't remember thinking about it, but apparently I decided that not trying to turn at all and just plowing straight off the road was a better idea than risking understeer and splitting the difference between my track and the desired track. Since you can see that fence T-post and telephone pylon in the photo I probably did well to avoid those. Also going off the road was about 4 feet in elevation change in three feet of distance, and I would have hated to hit that at anything less perpendicular than how I took it. If I'd have slid down that slope sideways there's a good chance the car would have flipped.  All-in-all it wasn't smart of me to take the car out in the weather conditions we had knowing something wasn't quite right with the brakes. Also I'd just turned around on this (dead end) road in a driveway that had mostly turned to mud right before this happened and the front wheels were slipping some as I was backing out, so mud was likely still packed in the treads when I was trying to brake. Not a good combination. This is the first time in my life I've had any sort of vehicular damage incident at speed and thankfully it was pretty minor. Lesson learned!  On the way home I had two more instances where the front right tire locked up at very low speeds and pretty insignificant brake pedal input, so something is definitely wrong there."
battlewagon,32yitv,SteezyTB,2,Fri Apr 17 19:46:33 2015 UTC,"So would it do anything if I were to get Outback or Forester springs and struts.    Yes, it will still raise your car, probably ~2.5"" instead of the ~3.5"" of lift you'd have on a regular Impreza.   If not, what other options would I have for a lift?   Strut-top spacers are the cheap and easy way to lift, but it's inadvisable to go beyond about an inch of lift this way.   And if I were to get a lift, would I need to replace other parts of the suspension (i.e. control arms, etc.)   If you just swap in springs+struts, you should be fine. It's when you start stacking forester struts with aftermarket lift springs chasing a taller lift that you push the boundaries of your suspension components. Keep in mind any lift wears your CV joints faster, but many people run replaced struts/springs with no apparent issues (and usually CV failure is brought on by a torn boot, not by just mechanical wear).  Keep in mind you'll have to get an alignment after lifting, but shouldn't run into issues with not having enough adjustability.  If you haven't already been, www.dirtyimpreza.com is a great resource for all things relating to rallying, lifting, off-roading, etc. Imprezas."
battlewagon,32yitv,why-not-zoidberg,2,Fri Apr 17 20:13:05 2015 UTC,"Strut blocks and spring swaps lift rigs the same way by pushing the wheel down.  So if you can go 2"" on one you can do 2"" on the other.  2"" is about max before you start dropping cross members."

battlewagon,32q14j,ZarK-eh,4,Thu Apr 16 01:06:04 2015 UTC,An XJ is built solely as an SUV while an AMC Eagle is based on the Concord which is a sedan/couple/wagon.  Most wagons are sedan/coupe derived.
battlewagon,32q14j,NeilOMalley,2,Thu Apr 16 01:21:49 2015 UTC,Is a Subaru Forester solely an SUV and not a wagon then?  Wikipedia seems to class both the Forester and the XJ as compact/crossover SUV.
battlewagon,32q14j,hottoddy,2,Thu Apr 16 10:06:55 2015 UTC,The first couple gens of the forester definitely felt more like a wagon.  I would not consider the 3rd gen or newer a wagon.

battlewagon,32q14j,PigSlam,2,Thu Apr 16 18:25:05 2015 UTC,I said it feels like one.  I think what makes a battlewagon a battlewagon is taking a street based vehicle and making it more off road capable.  Jeeps are already designed for off road use. Most wagons not so much.

battlewagon,327zwd,AdamsHarv,2,Sun Apr 12 02:47:06 2015 UTC,"It would depend on your tire size.  Its definitely going to be different, you will notice more body roll and a little boaty feel.  Your sway bars may need to be removed during the lift or at least find a way to adjust them or they will destroy the bushings.  Any parts that may need replacement such as ball joints, tie rods, bearing and bushings will definitely wear our faster and need replacing."

He never bothered to explain the policy, just showed me the difference and expected me to know that they don't do it.

battlewagon,31zccd,whiskeyfordinner,2,Thu Apr 9 22:54:56 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say my struts are shot the front drivers side just squeaks when I Go over a bump on that side. Also I didn't know the springs increased height lol I feel dumb but can you use old struts and just put taller springs on assuming the struts aren't busted  or do the struts have to be sized correctly

Just as a heads up though, my car needed 4 cv axles within 6 months, my sway bar links are shot all the way around ( New ones will be here today) and I replaced a front ball joint. If you have any weak suspension or driveline parts this lift will make them into bad suspension parts. Still worth the trouble in my eyes."
battlewagon,31zccd,NeilOMalley,2,Fri Apr 10 04:35:17 2015 UTC,You should just leave your sway bars disconnected for better travel while off road!

If your really looking for off road abilities you need a lift since most of the tires are meant for trucks and small rims with large sidewalls.
battlewagon,31rczf,ReptarSonOfGodzilla,2,Tue Apr 7 16:34:36 2015 UTC,"The grabbers will be tight, the geo might fit a tad bit better. My Grabbers barely fit on Fozzy take offs, and an OBS will be a good bit smaller clearance."

I'm hoping to someday go for 4"" and get some M/Ts. I'll get the M/Ts when I get another car to daily and make this one my off-road only.

battlewagon,31oopw,NeilOMalley,2,Tue Apr 7 00:07:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah removing the sway bars helps a lot.  First thing I dumped on my car.  With a 4"" you could probably stuff some 28"" KM2s under there, maybe a little trimming.  If you could make enough room a 29"" would give you a lot more options.  With all the work involved in a 4 you might as well go 6.  Then find a forester 4.44 trans and diff and weld it.  Then you can grenade axles all day!"
battlewagon,31oopw,NeilOMalley,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:14:04 2015 UTC,"I know I have to get ~0 offset wheels to make sure bigger tires don't rub on the strut, but I definitely think that I could fit some 28"" on with 4"" of lift. I need to look into dropping the subframe as I'm not actually sure how that whole process goes. I'm wanting to upgrade to King Springs and new struts since my suspension is all original.   I'm just afraid to go too big of tires. Not just because of rubbing, but also I'm afraid my car isn't going to be able to put down enough power if things get steep....maybe I'm over thinking how much it's going to make a difference.   I'll definitely look into the Forester rear diff to weld.   6"" is a lot of lift. I think it'd look a little goofy being that high. :p"
battlewagon,31oopw,This_Explains_A_Lot,5,Tue Apr 7 01:39:27 2015 UTC,"With a 4"" lift you will be putting a block everywhere the drive train bolts to the body.  Engine and transmission cross member, control arm mount, drive line carrier bearing, trailing arm mounts (unless you extend them) and the rear diff.  Then you will need to extend the steering, all coolant and wiring as needed and possibly shift linkage.  You will also need to redo your exhaust as it will then hang low after the engine drop.  Big tires definitely do put a strain on power but I run 29s with like 90hp, but then again I have a low gear.  The forester diff would require the matching transmission to not mess up the gearing.  4"" and 28"" mud terrains would be a safe bet.

battlewagon,31oopw,FesteringNeonDistrac,2,Tue Apr 7 01:08:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure if they make one for my car. It's been a while since I've looked.   And I do have an LSD in there, but when you're flexing this much it doesn't help as much as I'd like. :p"
battlewagon,31oopw,ninja_stalker,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:34:11 2015 UTC,Does airing down tires help in mud?  I know it helps tremendously in loose sand.  We don't get to play in mud here in California since it never rains :(
battlewagon,31oopw,NeilOMalley,2,Tue Apr 7 01:06:21 2015 UTC,"I believe it does help, but I don't have a compressor to air back up most of the time. :s"
battlewagon,31oopw,NCGeronimo,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:40:14 2015 UTC,"I've not done it, but there's some way that you can turn the AC compressor on the car into an air pump. Seems like a pretty popular and useful mod. Not sure if it leaves the AC functional though..."
battlewagon,31oopw,onimitsu,2,Tue Apr 7 11:48:04 2015 UTC,"It does not leave the A/C functional. It is quite literally, a compressor. So instead of running freon/r134 through it, you just open the inlet up to the air and the outlet to a tank or air chuck. Theres more to it than that, but that's the idea."
battlewagon,31oopw,onimitsu,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:45:47 2015 UTC,That's what I figured. Disregard comfort; acquire battewagon?
battlewagon,31oopw,Kurly_Q,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:02:53 2015 UTC,I guess it could a little to get a larger contact patch with the ground.  We usually air down for rocks and tree roots to help conform the tire.  Helps to have a tall skinny tire too in those conditions.
battlewagon,31oopw,JimBob-,6,Tue Apr 7 01:15:55 2015 UTC,Hey I remember your car from the last time you posted! You inspired my light bar
battlewagon,31oopw,futtigue,3,Tue Apr 7 00:56:57 2015 UTC,Glad I could be an inspiration! :)   That light bar looks great there!
battlewagon,31pdys,dpkristo,4,Tue Apr 7 02:51:42 2015 UTC,"Hard to find a solid mounting point for one on most wagons. For one, most wagons are unibody (versus many 4x4s are body-on frame), so you'd have to remove part of the bumper cover and mount to the bumper beam, or build a tube bumper to replace the stock bumper.  Also, it's possible to replace a winch with straps and a come-along (although labor intensive), or just hope that someone else has a vehicle that can help with recovery."
battlewagon,31pdys,why-not-zoidberg,2,Tue Apr 7 03:09:26 2015 UTC,Thanks. Body-on-frame trucks (Jeeps and Rams) and 4-wheelers are all I really know about about trail riding. There are some pretty impressive machines in this sub. Don't want to fall into a money pit (or unnecessary timesuck) if I pick up a battle-worthy wagon someday.
battlewagon,31pdys,Rangourthaman_,3,Tue Apr 7 04:46:23 2015 UTC,Mounting a winch on the front bumper beam should be fine. Just use a lighter one only for pulling yourself out.
battlewagon,31pdys,JP147,2,Tue Apr 7 08:55:43 2015 UTC,"Because I haven't got around to making a winch mount yet. Here is a Subaru with a winch installed. Subarus did come with a winch as an optional extra, these winch bumpers fit any 1st generation Leone."

The last owner had crashed it twice and the owner before that had left it sitting for years, overgrown with plants. It is a cheap, reliable daily driver and with regular maintenance it has no trouble handling the hard use I give it."
battlewagon,31lvsj,ThoseTwoRobots,2,Tue Apr 7 11:04:52 2015 UTC,That's pretty cool man.  How much did the car itself cost you without all the upgrades?

It already had the front bar, rear bar with tyre carrier, all terrain tyres (that didn't fit because it hadn't been lifted yet), UHF radio, quite a few other things too. It was more that what I had planned to pay for a car, but the guy didn't seem to want to sell it and I wanted to buy it, so I had to offer a bit higher."

battlewagon,31k9nr,Galaxywide,3,Mon Apr 6 00:06:01 2015 UTC,I had thought about it but had heard alot about it messing up the camber and since this is my everyday car I don't want to go to nuts with it. Maybe you can shed some light on lifts and outbacks? what is the best way to do it?
battlewagon,31k9nr,Galaxywide,2,Mon Apr 6 00:08:57 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't know much about the later model subies and lifts, as I've mostly been looking for info on SG foresters. However, I haven't heard anything about camber issues, on any year/model. I'd suggest looking around on NASIOC or the outback forum, I'm not sure what its called but google should be able to find it. About the only issue I've heard of is the need for trailing arm spacers with lifts over 1.25"" total (springs + spacers), to correct the tendency for the wheel to move forward. Another resource is Subtle-Solutions, I have heard great things about them and I'm sure they could help you out if you have questions."

Such as if there's a place where mud or wet leaves can accumulate in a quarter panel or fender and prevent it from draining.  Honestly, one of the best tricks is to simply sawzall your damn fenders off so there's nothing to rust, lol.  Most of the under-the-hood electronics are fairly resilient.  Some of us go to lengths to seal our ECU, old ammo cans work good for that.  Aside from that, the trick is to simply get parts with lifetime warranties.  I can't tell you how many times I've had my alternator and CV shafts replaced under warranty.  O'Reilly's fucking loves me."

Yeah, anything higher than 12 inches clearance at your rear diff makes it handle kinda shitty, in daily driving due to the higher CG, and offroad due to the taller gearing.  IMO, 26 or 27 inch tires and a 4 inch lift is perfect.  I often wish my dumb ass hadn't tried to fit 28 inch tires under my 2 inch lift."

While its nice to give a little wiggle room I think this will lead to a lot of posts that I would not consider appropriate.  While you may take your stock wagon ""offroad"" I would not consider it a battlewagon.  A battlwagon to me is a wagon that has been modified for offroad use.  If you have a stock wagon and would like ideas and comments then you should do a self post and list your pictures there.  I try not to be to hard on people who post inappropriate items and just try and report them.  Sorry but I want to see some cool stuff.

battlewagon,30uvtd,akjax,1 point,Tue Mar 31 23:44:36 2015 UTC,"Personally I think this is a poor way to try to address the problem. For example, look at this post and tell me it doesn't belong in the sub.   My suggestion would be that the rules should rely more on posting modified cars, and only have the ""must be on loose-surface"" apply to cars that have few mods, cars that if they were on pavement wouldn't make you think ""battlewagon"". Wording that correctly for rules would be kinda hard, but I feel like this loose surface rule is silly because it doesn't describe the car we want to see at all, it describes the ground, and I don't come to this sub to see ground, I come to see battlewagons.  Something like.. ""Please post pictures of wagons with at least two modifications designed to increase off-road capability. If you're posting a stock car, please only post pictures of your off-road adventure!"""

The question I would ask in turn is what's wrong with submitting it as part of a self post?  That is precisely how the rules used to read, and we received endless complaints they were being abused. The trial rules don't aim to address the car we want to see- that's the community's job achieved through votes. We all know we want to see battlewagons.  Stock cars, without fail, get fewer views and have lower approval ratings in this community.  The aim for specifying surface terrain is to differentiate between vehicles being used off road and those that are sitting in driveways, car parks, etc. That is the one complaint we have received nonstop since the sub came about- ""we don't want to see cars in driveways"". Users have also said they'd rather see a stock car off road and, conversely, a monstrosity in a parking lot. The population swings depending on the day and which group is being more vocal."
battlewagon,30uvtd,503maple,1 point,Mon Apr 6 09:12:31 2015 UTC,"what's wrong with submitting it as part of a self post?   I think a lot of people won't. I mean, they're called text posts, so it doesn't exactly lend its self to posting pictures in name alone. Link posts are for links (like pictures) and text posts are for text. I fully understand you can use a text link to post pictures, I just think a lot of people will not do that.   I think we will have some people that come in, see that rule, and don't post content because of it. Further more, I don't like rules that don't get enforced because they don't make sense. It doesn't make sense for people to post their pictures as a text posts just because we can't come up with good rules.  On top of that anyone who uses RES will tell you how annoying it would be if half the posts with pictures were text, which would keep the ""Show all images"" button from being very useful..  That post I linked, under the rules, it should be a text posts. But it's not, and I don't think anyone is complaining. So we're left where a situation where we have a post that is against the rules, but nobody, not even the mods or admin is going to do anything about it. Which really says ""the rules don't matter, because not even the admin/mods think they actually represent what we want to see in here.""  If you think those rules should stand, why hasn't that post been removed? Delete the post and tell OP to resubmit as a text post."

battlewagon,30v88y,Dandledorff,7,Mon Mar 30 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"Trust me, you don't want to deal with air suspension.  Not only is it obscenely expensive, but it will continue to be so whenever it has problems.  Also, it makes your ride worse, and fucks up your offroad ability because when you pump up the pressure to gain clearance, it makes your ride extra stiff, and consequentially destroys what little articulation you already have.  Whereas if you lift your existing struts or throw on Fozzie our Outtie struts, you'll still have the same amount of travel and damping.  The fuel economy advantage you'd gain by being able to lower your car a couple inches would be extremely negligible, especially considering you're adding a bit of weight to the car with the air suspension crap.  Trust me, two or four inches of clearance isn't gonna affect your fuel economy noticeably, unless you spend a lot of time over 80mph.  As for your other questions, I believe there are a few pre-made EJ bumpers and brush guards available, but if you like doing shit yourself, go get a $100 Harbor Freight welder and make one yourself.  You might also consider completely replacing your bumper with a tube bumper instead of just adding a brush guard.  Please, please, please don't put HIDs in your stock headlight enclosures.  You'll blind everyone else on the road.  Honestly, 80% of us don't really end up using our bright lights that much when offroading.  Best thing to do is just polish your headlights, maybe throw in some brighter halogen bulbs, possibly wire up some direct headlight relays to bypass the factory wiring and eek out a little more voltage, and to throw a couple fog/driving lights on.  Battery corrosion is inevitable, but excess could indicate an overcharging issue.  Hook up a multimeter to your battery with the car running and see how high it is.  Also try it with all your lights and accessories on.  It shouldn't really go over 14.5v.  Otherwise, just clean and paint the metal bits around your battery, coat the terminals in vaseline or that crap they have at the auto parts store, get a set of those red and green felt things for the terminals, and even try sticking a few pennies around the battery to absorb the corrosive gas that comes out."

You absolutely must have your own recovery equipment though. I have a shovel, recovery tracks and a rated snatch strap. The reason I say you have to have it is because AWD vehicles like the Forester are generally frowned upon because most owners don't do any research and get bogged more often than not. So if someone in a big 4WD sees you bogged and you haven't tried to get yourself out or have no equipment to get yourself out, don't be upset if they don't stop to help.

It's a small suv, probably more of a crossover, but not a wagon. I think you could make something cool out of it though.   I would see if you can put bigger tires and if necessary bigger wheels.   Maybe look at the drivetrain and see if it has awd or if it's just front wheel drive. I'd prefer an awd battlewagon.  As far as bolt on stuff I'd look into a roof rack, mud guards, and a lightbar. I'm not a fan of brushguards especially if you don't need them and yoy daily drive your car. If you hit somebody that bursh guard is going to fuck them up a lot more than a naked front end.   Maybe wrap or plastidip your car to give it a cool look without breaking the bank?   If it were mine I would modify the back so you can sleep in it. I'd make it more of a mini overlander ( /r/overlanding ) than a battlewagon.  Just my opinion, do what you want. When I try and buy parts with other people's opinions, it never works.

The Aztek consistently is ranked among polls as the ugliest car ever made along with the Ford Edsel. At this point if you still have one I would consider it almost a collector's item of sorts."

battlewagon,30d42d,corbrizzle,5,Thu Mar 26 14:24:32 2015 UTC,"Any brake pad that when you stomp on it activates the ABS is more than good enough. Unless you are tracking. Your car 100% of the time the basic set at your FLAPS will work for you.  The point is that if ABS goes on you are about to/in the process of locking up your brakes.  So if your pads activate abs you are at the limit of grip for your tires.  I have 235 summers on a 05' Saab 9-2x(read WRX) and have no problem with locking them up with basic pads on dry pavement. Easier in the slick/on dirt.    To echo everyone else, the job takes 1-2hrs total when you know what your doing, easy for a beginner. Might take a full afternoon, but you will get through it. Find a buddy that has done it, buy a 6 pack/pizza and invite him over to help."

Was doing it by myself and the wheelwell was getting in the way of longer wrenches as I recall.  All I had was my socket set -  big adjustable wrench might have done the trick easier.  Also, have a C-clamp to push the piston in.  If you don't, buy one or two, they're good to have for various things especially if you get into woodworking."
battlewagon,30d42d,drphilthy,2,Thu Mar 26 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"Quick checklist:   Service manual although you really don't need this for brakes socket set (I think the most common sizes you will need are 12mm 14mm, and 17mm) torque wrench and torque specs (these are also in the manual somewhere but I can never seem to find them) for any bolts you take out if you aren't changing your rotors, you should hose them down with brake cleaner (do not apply this to the pads) high temp brake grease for the pins (good time to inspect the pins and the pin boots) might need some liquid wrench to bust up rust   Brakes are surprisingly easy to work on and you save a ton of money. Just work on one side at a time so you don't mix up the parts. Make sure you are on a level surface, and probably block off the tires since you can't use your parking brake while working on rears."

battlewagon,30d42d,Unaidedgrain,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:44:54 2015 UTC,Also another thing that should be on that checklist is a clamp or something to push the piston back into the caliper. They make a cheap tool but I don't know what it's called

Decently cheap, made by a reputable manufacturer (Centric is the OEM/fleet division of Stop-Tech), quiet, some brake dust but it wipes off easily.  Also, take this as an opportunity to check your caliper slide pins (additional photo, visible at the top of the caliper bracket); I found that a few of mine (on an '04) had corrosion. When you have the calipers removed, pull each slide pin 1/2"" or so out, it should feel smooth and return roughly to its original position."

But as others have said, your best bet is finding a snow tire.  And taller tires are a bad idea, not just cause of the rubbing, but because you're gearing up an already gutless car.  I like your idea about finding some golf cart tires.  Have you looked into ATV wheels/tires?  From what I understand, Yamaha ATVs also use the 4x100 lug pattern."

battlewagon,2zq56s,SweetPotardo,2,Sat Mar 21 00:28:32 2015 UTC,yeah thats what I meant. And if I did that itd probably be for off road only. If I were to do that Id keep the 14s with street tires for dd and swap out to the 12s and UTV tires for fun.

battlewagon,2z3u3b,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sun Mar 15 11:51:13 2015 UTC,"I swapped because sealed beam glass bulbs are $10 each, whereas the big square headlights for the GL are impossible to find anywhere but craigslist/ebay/dealership, and way more expensive.  Mechanically all you need is the dual headlight buckets from a DL, along with the 4 bolts per side. The holes are already tapped into the GL unibody so no drilling required! Make sure to grab the corner lights from the donor car as well, they're narrower and clear the different headlight assembly.   Electrically you need to add a relay (or a giant diode) to fix the control for the inner 2 lights. With the addition of a relay, all 4 of my lights are on when low beams (outer 2 low), and all 4 are also on during high beam usage (outer 2 using high filaments).   Alternatively you could just wire the 2 inner lights to a relay and add a switch in your dash.  Without a relay, you'll end up having the inner 2 lights on when low beams are on, and off when high beams are on. This is just the nature of the dash switch in the GL."

Undercoated makes a huge difference for structural components.  As for swapping it, It would probably be a pain without a shop, but I can see it done relatively easily. I had to pull my subframe down to change my transmission mount and I was on my back in what amounts to a hole in the ground."
battlewagon,2yzeko,ItsPrimetime,2,Sat Mar 14 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"Nice to know that most outback subframes would probably work. I had heard about a recall done on those where Subaru forgot to rust-proof the subframe for that year, and figured that undercoating would need to get done.  I'm mainly worried about the 214K miles on it, but after seeing the work that was already done and the price makes me feel more comfortable with it being higher mileage."

battlewagon,2yyaon,Maschinenbau,13,Fri Mar 13 21:11:53 2015 UTC,I have a 5MT and pretty much only drive stick cars. After I rode in a 4eat with the lock up mod I realized I built the wrong car. The auto is by far a better bet imho.

It had so many issues with the engine that Subaru replaced the engine free of charge. It still had so many issues they said they would buy it back from him and give him a discount on this years outback. Sadly, that's when he found out that they no longer make them in manual. Why subaru, why?!"
battlewagon,2yyaon,kevinpdx,4,Wed Mar 18 01:35:53 2015 UTC,What do you mean by big lift and tires?  For most stuff an automatic will be better for people who are not experienced.  You can also get an auto in 4.44 to sort of make up for not having a low range.

With the auto a little throttle modulation and let the torque converter sort it out.  The downside to the auto off road is that it's mostly a FWD that the rear wheels are powered when slipping. This can be fixed with a mod to the torque split solenoid or something like that, I haven't found it necessary yet."
battlewagon,2yyaon,bcvx,2,Sat Mar 14 06:35:04 2015 UTC,"the 4EAT locks the center chunk in 1 or 2, and you can mod it to make that a toggle switch for any gear selection."

I've skipped a week of submitting because I did not take pictures the last couple times I was out.  This weekend was amazing. Drove roughly 70-80miles of gravel roads this weekend. As the title of this post states there is now a rule that my buddy and I have adopted for our outings and that is: ""If the road splits we must take the one that appears to ascend"". It's lead to some absolutely great places! Best rule! My paint took an absolute beating this trip and yet, apart from the dirty scratches, appears to have held strong and I should be able to buff it all out. There were a number of spots where tree branches spanned across and touched eachother from both sides of the road and I plowed through. (I figure if it gets too bad I still have 2/3 of a gallon of paint left over for a respray). If you are thinking about a new, white paint job for your car I HIGHLY recommend using Ford's Oxford White, single stage. This stuff is tuff! Next time I'll get pictures of this, it was honestly insane, ha.  Anyway, hope the pictures are fun to look at! Enjoy the Pacific Northwest scenery!  -Kershaw Hatchet (http://amzn.com/B000EYHF9G)  -Woody's 20"" LED bar (Bought at Napa, looks like a rebrand of another companies LED bar. Decent quality, 54 Watt, 18 LED, 4050 Lumen)  -Cheap Para-cord from local sporting goods store. 100ft of 50lb is what I keep handy.  .  .  .  PS- It seems every time I take this car out it amazes me that, for a barely modified car, it can handle some of the places I have taken it. This isn't 'actual offroad' to me, but it's offroad exploration and taking my car where few cars have ever gone. I don't expect it to crawl over large rocks and through deep mud, but when I get to a steep grade of loose, softball sized rocks and the car climbs for 100 plus feet without even flinching or pushes through trees and thick brush it puts a damn big smile on my face. That's what this battle wagon is to me. Fun!  It leaves home cleaned up and proper and comes back scratched, dented, antennas twisted, bumpers slightly loose, branches hanging on to the undercarriage, and tires spitting bits of gravel in protest of being back on solid pavement once again.. but it handled it.. It's small battle against the misconception that these are nothing more than commuter cars as it returns home with mud caked fender wells, nature scraps, and new scars. Trophies from a hard day's driving.  end story/rant  TLDR: I like my car for what it is and it's fun to shatter molds."

battlewagon,2ya8np,Cyfun06,1 point,Fri Mar 20 12:14:23 2015 UTC,That didn't start until like 2009 or so? They made ralliart models before that which weren't turbo or awd

battlewagon,2ya8np,JP147,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"How do you go about lifting cars?  Do companies make aftermarket lift kits, or is it a matter of using stock parts from other models of cars?  Is there a listing somewhere of recommended swap parts which work?"
battlewagon,2ya8np,JamesNonstop,3,Sun Mar 8 15:13:08 2015 UTC,"The answer is ""it depends.""  Some subarus are a bolt-in fit, but they're the exception rather than the rule, which is why they're so popular with the aftermarket crowd - there's usually somebody who'll buy the parts you take off to help offset the cost of the parts you put on!  You can use spacers with sit on top of the strut, or longer struts and springs (Using Fozzie struts on an impreza, for instance). There's an upper limit to how high you can go doing that before you're shelling out for fabrication. Eventually, you're going to have a stressed out drivetrain from driving wheels with tie rods at angles they weren't designed for, CV joints sitting where they weren't designed for, struts constantly under pressure they weren't designed for...  I've got a 2014 XV, and my rear struts groan a little bit with just a 1"" spacer. I'm getting a more complete lift kit later this year with springs and subframe spacers, but until I do that it is going to put additional wear on the stock parts. Gotta pay to play."
battlewagon,2ya8np,KiboshWasabi,4,Mon Mar 9 06:07:28 2015 UTC,"Well, what kind of driving do you plan on doing?  If it's going to be primarily a daily driver with some light trail use, get a first-gen Legacy with the SOHC EJ22, then lift it with Outback parts.  Outbacks are great, but the 2.5 liter is prone to head gasket failures.  But you can find old Leggys in good mechanical condition for next to nothing. If you're as mechanically inclined as you claim, you could pick up an Outback with a blown headgasket for a few hundred bucks and fix it yourself.  If you want to do more serious offroading and want a low-range transmission, get an older Subaru GL/Loyale and lift it.  If you find one that has engine issues, this is actually a good thing, cause it's a prime candidate for swapping in the previously mentioned EJ22 from a Leggy.  Aside from Soobies, about the only other easy/cheap BW is one of the 4wd Toyota Tercels from the mid-80s, but they're hard to find."

That being said my advise is don't rush in, take some time do some research. Use Kijijijijiji and autotrader.ca and whatever else to see whats out there. Not necesarilly to find the one but to get an idea what sort of rides are in your price range. Volvo's Toyotas, Mitsu's, Nissans, there are lot of awd/4wd hatchies and wagons out there to choose from, AMC Eagles, Daihatsu's, don't limit your possibilites. Once you see something you like, or better yet a few strong candidates that catch your eye, than start actually shopping for a specific sale."

battlewagon,2y5dh3,wolf2600,3,Fri Mar 6 20:25:11 2015 UTC,I live in colorado. Seems like there are plenty of options on craigslist around here. I just picked up a 1988 corolla all trac wagon in good condition which seems like it's going to be awesome but i would love to have something with a low range option. The corolla is full time awd with locking center diff if i'm not mistaken.

battlewagon,2y5dh3,Cyfun06,2,Fri Mar 6 21:38:32 2015 UTC,This would be my first option if I were to build a battle wagon.
battlewagon,2y5dh3,SecondaryLawnWreckin,5,Sat Mar 7 08:53:39 2015 UTC,"Aside from 80s Subarus, the mid-80s Toyota Tercel wagon came in a 4wd version.  The AMC Eagle is 4wd, but technically a Jeep.  I can't remember if the Toyota Corolla All-Trac was true 4wd, but wikipedia thinks so. Those were made from 88-92.  The Toyota Previa minivan did come in an All-Trac version as well."

battlewagon,2y5dh3,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sat Mar 7 14:12:10 2015 UTC,No it's a corolla all trac... i wish a had the celica they have turbo and more power. Although i could put a turbo kit on the corolla with mods and get over 300hp!
battlewagon,2y5dh3,baccaruda66,1 point,Sat Mar 7 14:25:28 2015 UTC,"Is it the wagon or the sedan? The sedans are super rare! I'm not sure of the details on the corollas. Pretty sure the corolla is a more truck like setup (solid rear axle, longitudinal motor). PICS!  I'd swap over to the 4age over the 4afe as a first step towards power."
battlewagon,2y5dh3,baccaruda66,1 point,Sun Mar 8 02:07:57 2015 UTC,Yeah its the wagon and it does have a solid rear axle.
battlewagon,2y5dh3,slotard,4,Sun Mar 8 02:19:51 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Info regarding manual transmissions only.     Any 1985 - 1994 Subaru GL/Loyale-series with a push-button actuated 4WD (look for an orange ""4WD"" button in the shifter) has a locking center differential. Look for 4WD XT (4-cyl), GL-10 (often turbo'd), and the RX.   http://i.imgur.com/06JrGYk.jpg  The only such example of this feature included with a dual range feature is in the 1987-1989 RX, which are rare to find. It has a 3:70 output which is nice for gas mileage and street driving but not aggressive for many people who are serious offroaders. The good news is that if you find an intact RX, it has a rear LSD (also 3.70 of course).  http://i.imgur.com/G7cbFsF.jpg  I have an RX transmission and LSD in my car and love it. The dual range is only a mild reduction and it's awesome as a gear splitter in traffic or on a medium-grade hill. With some work, one can combine parts to make a dual-range FT4WD transmission (and matching rear end) with a 3.90 or 4.11 gear ratio but this is a complicated project. Also complicated but slightly less so would be to put a different dual range gearset in to give a steeper reduction for offroad use.  A GL/Loyale transmission can be swapped into a newer model with some customization of various parts; a dual-range transmission for the 90s models is occasionally available from some importers. I don't believe it is available with a locking center diff, but I do think that the locking center section of an older transmission could be swapped into the newer dual range.   Check out the USMB forums for tons of info and projects that will be relevant to your interests here. Cheers!"

battlewagon,2y5dh3,JP147,3,Sat Mar 7 17:52:24 2015 UTC,"While Subarus haven't had true 4WD from the factory in a long time, it isn't hard to wire up one with the 4EAT transmission (the 4 speed auto they used for a long time) so that you can manually lock the center diff. Depending on year, you need the switch to either disconnect a certain wire (those years the solenoid unlocks the diff) or provide 12V to it (those years the solenoid locks the diff). While it isn't factory 4WD, with the modification made and engaged it is.  On a stick it isn't so easy."

battlewagon,2xmcc0,DrGrebo,16,Mon Mar 2 01:18:15 2015 UTC,"I like this build a lot because it's not a body on frame swap, it's an actual built subframe.  This is the proper way to do it, gives you way more flex and offroad ability"
battlewagon,2xmcc0,NeilOMalley,2,Mon Mar 2 01:35:47 2015 UTC,"How does this give it ""more flex and offroad ability""? That depends mostly on the suspension rather than what it's mounted to. Additionally, I'm not sure I'd trust a Subaru unibody to hold up to all that much off road abuse, whereas a truck frame would do better."
battlewagon,2xmcc0,slotard,3,Tue Mar 3 01:20:03 2015 UTC,Well for one a custom sub frame like this one has keeps all the suspension and drive train parts closer to the body not hanging down in the way.  Also most body on frame swaps sit so high in the air due to the frame not fitting into the body like stock so they are definitely more top heavy and wont be able to fully flex and tuck.  The rear is long travel leaves and the front looks to be 3 or 4 linked with coils.  Could you make that happen with a frame?  Sure! But a custom tube frame will make things way easier to configure and to keep out of the way.

battlewagon,2xlnil,Zorenstein,6,Sun Mar 1 21:49:02 2015 UTC,"While I like your plans of building a battlewagon I will not comment on your choice of acquiring funds.  For a lift I found a site with some details on how to get around 2.5"" of lift.   I got Bilstein HD's for the front, flipped and raised the coil seats 1/2 in which gave me 2 1/4 inches of lift in the front. I put on Jeep Cherokee front springs in the rear which gave me 2 inches of lift and then Pro Comp shocks for the back. Crandandall influenced me quite a bit with his 240. It's got 235/75/15 Wrangler MT/R's and 14'' of ground clearance at the rockers now. No more rocks harming it.   I don't like wheel spacers but do as you wish.  You will want to remove sway bars not add them.  This will help with articulation and keeping all four tires on the ground. Lights, skid plates, braces and exhaust are all good things. With 2.5"" of lift you can run a 28-29"" tire with little to no trimming as long as you don't have a high offset on your wheels.  Your biggest issue for any real offroading will be traction.  You are RWD with an open diff which means you are pretty much 1WD offroad.  I do not know what axle you could fab up for a new rear diff which could fit a air locker, and I am pretty sure you don't want to weld the diff either.  I would say keep things relatively simple and you won't be fixing as much stuff later down the road."
battlewagon,2xlnil,NeilOMalley,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"Keep the stock axle, and don't weld the diff. Depending on the year the wagon will likely have a 1030 (Dana 30) or 1031 (Dana 30 with metric threads). A diff from the front of a Jeep with a Dana 30 will bolt in with little if any modification.   Trutrac lockers are a food option too, and it's what I'll be going with on my Volvo 145 overlander. Here's some info on that: http://forums.turbobricks.com/showthread.php?t=189043  Another option is to use a G80 limited slip from later volvos with a 1041 rear, 940 turbo's I think. You do have to trim about 1/2"" off of an axle, but info on the G80 and Volvo rear ends can be found here, and here."

battlewagon,2xhivf,JP147,10,Wed Mar 4 16:59:36 2015 UTC,"There's been some debate on whats a wagon and whats an SUV. For me if the vehicle sits on a truck frame, its not a wagon. So the Pathfinder for example is based on the D21 Hardbody, its essentially a pick up truck with back seats, not a wagon. Same thing for XJ's and S10 blazers. A small truck platform is still a truck and not a wagon. Same applies for wagon shells bolted to truck frames. Really it comes down to the idea of a proper Station Wagon, a car based platform, with a liftgate, hatchback/shooting brake design.   That being said I don't know why we need /r/battlewagons AND /r/Battlecars, they ought to be merged, but whatever."
battlewagon,2xhivf,Cyfun06,2,Sun Mar 1 08:36:03 2015 UTC,Personally I think of wagons as being unibody... Obviously there are a few exceptions.   That being said the pathfinder isn't one of them.   Body on frame CUV is really what it is. Cool cars though.

battlewagon,2xhivf,MissVancouver,2,Sat Feb 28 22:15:20 2015 UTC,They are unibody with 2 small chassis rails going almost all the way down the car. Which is more than a lot of 80s Japanese cars.
battlewagon,2xhivf,KiboshWasabi,2,Sun Mar 1 08:04:24 2015 UTC,"What makes a battlewagon a battlewagon isn't so much whether it's literally a station wagon.  In my book, a BW is a vehicle that wasn't originally intended to be offroaded, but has been modified to do so.  However, the original meaning of a BW is that it's a vehicle that you'd literally drive into battle.  So pretty much any vehicle that is offroad-capable, and rather intimidating-looking due to it having homemade tube bumpers and being kind of beat up should qualify."

I would plan ahead though, assuming its the 3L like most are it makes decent power however they are essentially FWD and IIRC they use a viscous fluid center differential and excessively oversized tires can be hell on transaxles and VFCD when really wheeling. I would do a smallish lift and maybe find some aftermarket rims in a dimension appropriate for wider more aggressive but only moderately taller tires. Maybe a bull bar, hi-lift, tire carrier that sort of thing. I wonder if Bushwhacker makes anything for the Escape. At any rate, have fun."

battlewagon,2x5vt2,joeyagain,2,Wed Feb 25 22:21:06 2015 UTC,"This is going to take a LOT of one off fab. But I would start by looking at the rally communities. Z's aren't that uncommon and if anyone has already done it, its them."
battlewagon,2x5vt2,KiboshWasabi,2,Thu Feb 26 08:35:09 2015 UTC,"You mean like this?  I'm assuming you want it to be 4 wheel drive, as it would be kind of silly not to be.  I can guarantee you there won't be an easy way to do this.  You've gotta somehow fit an axle under the front. And if you plan on doing serious offroading, it'll be a solid axle, which will require more clearance.  The stock suspension and rear axle will be pretty much useless, as strut blocks are only good for an inch or two.  Your best bet will be to put it on a something like a Blazer frame, complete with the engine, trans, axles, and suspension.  In fact, according to the link I posted: ""My friend Cliff Trent built this fun little z...Its done with a ford bronco II frame and running gear with the ford 2.8 v-6. The z fit right on the frame with hardly no mods at all!"""
battlewagon,2x5vt2,Cyfun06,1 point,Thu Feb 26 10:05:49 2015 UTC,"How much do you want to lift it, and what size tire do you want to run?"
battlewagon,2x5vt2,guitarsandguns,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:42:56 2015 UTC,Looking for 3-6 inches. Tired will depend on how much clearance I can get from the lift.  I'm basically looking for the most lift for the least custom modification. I was really crossing my fingers on a Datsun truck suspension hack or something of the sort but that's just wishful thinking.
battlewagon,2x5vt2,NeilOMalley,2,Thu Feb 26 01:08:26 2015 UTC,I think you will find its going to take quite a bit of custom work to lift it that much.  You could always do a frame swap.
battlewagon,2x5vt2,Mister_Murica,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:43:17 2015 UTC,"Much beyond 2"" plus I'd imagine you'd be running into issues with suspension geometry and stress on axle shafts and the likes, along with misplaced wheel in the fenders due to suspension links and wheel alignment being out of wack (I don't know Z-cars at all so I can't speak much to that though).  However, I think strut spacers (HDPE spacers cut-out in the design of the strut top hat and sandwiched between the strut's top and the vehicle, will probably require longer and stronger top hat studs) and longer springs with a stiffer spring weight (not sure if the 280SX is a coilover strut design, but this would provide harder suspension as well) would be your best option for ~2-3"" of lift. Again like others have said, you will have to fab pieces up and may run into clearance and excessive wear issues on moving parts."

This is on top of the 1"" lift spacers I put in last week, so it's quite a bit more height than stock.  They're Team Dynamics 15"" wheels with +40mm offset, 7"" wide, 5x100. You can't use the stock lug nuts for these, you'll have to order some tuner lugs. I used these.  Tires are Grabber AT2, 225/70R/15. The taller sidewall translates into a softer ride. The XV doesn't corner as sharp as it did stock, but if I was worried about on-road vs off-road performance I wouldn't have lifted it in the first place. They're much grippier off road than the stock Yokohamas - I took a turn that would have kicked the rear out on stock tires, and the Grabbers held on to the dirt and took the corner like I was on tarmac.  They sit a little close to the front edge of the rear fender, like less than an inch, but the suspension travels up and to the rear on the rear axles, so it'll clear the fender if you hit a bump. AZ is supposed to get a lot of snow this week, so I'll update if there are any issues with ice building up in the wheel well."

battlewagon,2wqab0,NeilOMalley,4,Sun Feb 22 05:25:49 2015 UTC,Are you at the white gate just past the entrance to the gravel pit or the one further up that goes to the connecter trail?  There is also the back way up but I though that was closed completely.
battlewagon,2wqab0,NeilOMalley,3,Sun Feb 22 06:11:06 2015 UTC,The the gate at the bottom of bear creek mainline where it connects to lake cavanaugh road
battlewagon,2wqab0,NeilOMalley,3,Sun Feb 22 06:50:45 2015 UTC,Is that the gate you got in through?
battlewagon,2wqab0,NeilOMalley,3,Sun Feb 22 06:56:01 2015 UTC,Yea it was open when we got here but when we went back down at ~4:30 it was closed.
battlewagon,2wqab0,NeilOMalley,3,Sun Feb 22 06:58:54 2015 UTC,Well you might be stuck out there for the night then.  Not sure why that gate was even open as that is not the true entrance for the ORV park.  The only way I know to get out is to follow Bear Creek Mainline to BR-23 then go down Lower Mainline/Easy Valley Connector to another gate but it is usually closed and you have to use the bypass which you can only do in a pretty big lifted rig.  You guys need anything?

battlewagon,2whzq7,PunksPrettyMuchDead,13,Fri Feb 20 01:38:58 2015 UTC,"Primitive 1"" lift spacers, front and mid skid plates, rear diff cover. Rokblokz mud flaps.  Tons of thanks to Steven at Primitive, I called them a few times today to pick their brains on reattaching the wheel hubs, and they were great at explaining what I needed to do.  The skid plates were an easy install, just jack the car up, line up the holes, and put in the screws. Getting the rear diff cover in place was a lot less tricky than I'd read.  The mud flaps were also easy - the front are bolt-on, and the rears only required drilling one hole in the fender liner. No flimsy brackets like the Rally Armors, and they're a lot sturdier. They sit quite flush into the wheel well, I'm not worried about how the grabber AT2's are going to fit next week.  The suspension was a motherfucker, and again, I couldn't have done it without calling Primitive up. Keep in mind I don't even normally change my own oil - I'm jumping right in and learning by doing with this car. It's difficult to get the strut tops in place with one hand while threading the bolts with the other in the front, if you're a regular gym goer you'll have an easier time. Disconnecting the sway bar on one side makes it easy to line up the wheel hub and reattach the strut.  The rear strut was a real pain, I had to knock on a neighbor's door to recruit help in getting the strut back in position. Again, disconnecting the sway bar helped a little, but the rear took some prying, hitting, bleeding, and me pressing down on the wheel hub with my foot to get the strut in place.  I've got a set of Team Dynamics wheels and some Grabber AT2's sitting in a garage, going to get those mounted next week and I'll followup with some more photos!  I've also done a muffler delete, it's just a Walker exhaust intermediate pipe that matches the flange on the exhaust pipe. Bolts right on, I had an exhaust shop weld a hanger on. 16 for the part, 20 for the weld job, a much better sound for only 36 bucks!"
battlewagon,2whzq7,Decembermouse,5,Fri Feb 20 01:39:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I don't own a Crosstrek, but I have friends with one and my girlfriend sort of wants one. I've done some searching for interesting mods but haven't found much.  I've been evangelizing these perhaps a bit too much lately, but it's because of how impressed I've been after doing this mod myself - have you thought about swapping out some of your car's bulbs for LEDs? I recently installed some in my car and the results are great. The main things you usually think about are: no heat, very low power, don't burn out, and brighter than stock bulbs, but there's more than that. With brake bulbs, LEDs are better for another reason. They have a faster response time than incandescent. Example  The bulbs I got are the 80W CREE type bulbs with the projector lens, which are brighter than the regular $9 Ebay ones with all the tiny LED chips on them. I'm not trying to sell you anything, I don't know these guys or have an Ebay shop, but it's a really cool and easy mod with safety as well as cosmetic and electrical benefits. Since you clearly enjoy improving upon your vehicle I figured I'd chime in. Also here's a link to the bulb types for the Crosstrek if you're curious about doing this.  I also got the same exact bulbs but in white for my reverse lights, and I can see so much behind me now, whereas with the incandescent bulbs, they were only good for letting people know I was backing up ... not bright enough to light up the area behind me so I could actually see what was back there.  To end this strange and disjointed comment, I have a question for you. I found this and since you seem to know the Crosstrek pretty well, do you have any opinions on it? I don't buy the whole ""the OEM pulley will fail"" but I think shaving 3.5 lbs might give some benefits. However I don't own an XV, I just like to daydream about what I'd do to one. So if you have thoughts feel free to share!"
battlewagon,2whzq7,Decembermouse,2,Fri Feb 20 02:19:33 2015 UTC,"I do want to do a full LED swap eventually, but that's way down the line. I am going to replace all the interior bulbs with LED because I do like how bright they are, and the more blue-ish tint of a white LED. That's a 15 dollar mod, though, not something I have to budget for.  I'm not going to mess with the engine for a long while, and when I do, this probably won't be high on the list. I don't think it'll make the engine any more or less reliable, but I did replace my own alternator on a 2006 Malibu once, and now if I don't have to mess with a serpentine belt, I won't. That seems like something Subaru would void an engine warranty for, too."
battlewagon,2whzq7,sun__hands,5,Fri Feb 20 02:53:23 2015 UTC,"| That seems like something Subaru would void an engine warranty for, too.  Yeah, that's probably true...  You should post more pics when you do the LED swap. I recently did blue interior LEDs in my car and the same bulb on the license plate, and love how it looks. But the exterior lights are fantastic too, and not much more expensive than the interior lights... just a lot more of them on the exterior."

I have to put my feet between the front seats, but I've gone car camping in an Aveo and this thing is massive in comparison.  The next round of mods (Outside next week's wheel and tire install) won't be for a couple months, but the plan is a bar with lights and a roof basket.  A more distant goal is that Primitive winch, that's a pretty sweet setup, and I know I'll get into places where I could use it."

The other was that some engines, especially high-compression engines (like ours I believe?) require a bit of back-pressure to operate perfectly.   Perhaps you, or somebody else on this sub can enlighten me so I can take it back off without concern?  Oh and nice job with the lift, thats a goal for mine too"

With the stock bulbs, they were only bright enough to warn anyone behind me that I'm backing up - not bright enough to light up the area for me. And with the LED brake lights, there's no lag between when I push the brake pedal and when they light up, unlike incandescent bulbs. If you have one of each type installed on the left and right taillights of a car at the same time you'll see the incandescents take a split second to light up, and the LEDs don't..."

Run a 4 link in the rear and a 3 or 4 in the front.  EJ22, Dual-Range linked to a Suzuki divorced transfer case on a couple built Toyota axles.

However when it comes to actual off roading, while my subaru can make it through some decently muddy and horridly sandy trails you can't really compare it to a jeep. The XJ has solid axles, more clearance and is all around tougher and more purpose build off roader, you can easily modify it too, I've helped him install a lift and a differential locker and it was pretty straight forward, if you're looking to do more off roading than anything the XJ is the way to go but if you just want a fun to drive, fuel efficient daily driver that can still hold it's own off road then the subaru is the way to go but just remember you won't be rock crawling in your subbie without heavily modifiying the shit out of it first."

battlewagon,2vxcyw,ShaoLimper,2,Sun Feb 15 03:53:54 2015 UTC,"Crosstrek has this hands down. Slightly more ground clearance (similar yes, within .4 inches), full time balanced(symmetrical) awd system with 50/50 capability at all speeds and even under braking vs a part time system that disengages at certain speeds or under braking.  I am not saying that the Crosstrek is an off road beast or that the Kia will be terrible, but even now most suv cannot compare to the Crosstrek in off road capabilities and there is a slum chance that kia will step up to that plate when no one else in the market really wants to.   I gave the Crosstrek hybrid serious thought before buying my Outback. Sometimes I wish I got the xv but my outback just rocks off road"

And the electric motors may not provide a lot of horsepower, but the torque would surely help on the slower stuff. The regenerative braking could also help with hill descents.

Make sure you change the gear oil regularly. These transmissions are hard to find since these cars are the only ones in the world to use them.   Also, the biggest thing you need to check, is where the swaybar bolts to the lower control arm. Need to remove that and make sure there isnt any rust on the control arm under the bushings, if its rusted, and it snaps, its not pretty.   If the 62hp is a little low for you, the 4a is a direct swap. If you're up to the challenge, the 4age fits with extensive modifications. Any A series motor will fit actually.

battlewagon,2vq8h8,FesteringNeonDistrac,3,Fri Feb 13 19:11:20 2015 UTC,You do know that Subaru made 4wd wagons starting in 1972 right?  I'm not knocking AMC but others were already doing it.

battlewagon,2vq8h8,kilogttam,1 point,Fri Feb 13 19:10:10 2015 UTC,"Bigger tires, higher ride height, off-road lights, bigger bumpers, roof baskets, locking differentials, etc.  If you prefer, we can say they're making Subarus and other similar car based vehicles more like 4Runners, Land Rovers, trucks, etc., but don't pretend it's something else.  There's noting wrong with making these cars more like trucks in general, there's no need to be offended by someone stating it that way."
battlewagon,2vq8h8,PigSlam,1 point,Sat Feb 14 05:08:21 2015 UTC,"Not offended and I don't prefer either way, just not sure why you would specify Jeep.. what we do is make them even more capable off-road and that's not a Jeep thing."

The JUKE has the same underpinnings as the Cube and Versa and some other chassis' that are really meant for tarmac. Also the little 1.6L, forced induction or not, is going to struggle with anything more than a gravel road especially considering its paired with a CVT which is probably the greatest weakness of the model.   All that being said where theres a will theres a way. Nevermind if you should do it, you certainly could do it. Doesn't look too bad either. Here's the source. Google is your friend. :]"

battlewagon,2vqjxl,jeepdave,8,Fri Feb 13 08:08:17 2015 UTC,A Camry has off road potential if you don't care about body damage and keep your foot deep enough in it. But the Juke would suffer if it's equipped with that damn CVT. I'd rather wheel a Reliant Robin.
battlewagon,2vqjxl,jeepdave,1 point,Fri Feb 13 13:22:29 2015 UTC,Alright can someone explain to me WHY cvts are so hated?
battlewagon,2vqjxl,AdamsHarv,2,Sat Feb 14 00:03:46 2015 UTC,Best way I can explain it is they are soul crushing to drive.
battlewagon,2vqjxl,jeepdave,3,Sat Feb 14 02:25:35 2015 UTC,"so far all of the research I have done indicates that they are superior in every way, and that the only reason people dont like them is because the way they feel is similar to how a manual feels when the clutch is slipping. reminds me of how angry my dad was when my mom bought our first HDTV because he was used to squares screens, not rectangular ones."
battlewagon,2vqjxl,jeepdave,3,Sat Feb 14 06:48:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of the hate comes from the enthusiast community.  97% of drivers couldn't care less about cars.   The majority of posts here or any auto subreddit are by enthusiasts.   So it seems that everyone hates them.   Realistically they are boring to drive (to the same extent as an automatic at least), troublesome (infant technology), and are slower then most manuals (cough Wrx)  That being said, in many cases they allow for better fuel economy and for the vast majority of car buyers, that is a much bigger consideration then sportiness or driver engagement.   Ex. Look at the WRX's CVT. It's slower then the manual and gets worse fuel economy. Why bother to get it?   Personally I don't think there is anything wrong with CVTs; I just would not get one at this point in time.   There is nothing more disconcerting then hearing the engine slowly go from a dull pure to a loud roar while you're maintaining the same speed...."
battlewagon,2vqjxl,YouMustChill,-2,Wed Feb 18 21:14:14 2015 UTC,"Like I said, soul crushing. Also simple is superior when it comes to off road. They are not simple."

battlewagon,2vqjxl,AnusTartarus,3,Fri Feb 13 07:33:02 2015 UTC,I own a cross trek and drive a Murono often. Both with a CVT and I can say for certain that the Nissan CVT is much better.

battlewagon,2vqjxl,Burning_Kobun,3,Fri Feb 13 23:49:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I think it depends on your intentions for the car! If you're intending to tackle little more than the odd dirt road and taking it to the snow, you'll probably find it to be more than adequate. If you intend to tackle anything technical (say, a rocky up hill trail), my guess is that it will leave a lot to be desired. While I cannot say for sure, the Juke likely has a much stiffer and sportier suspension, not really meant to have any articulation/flex. We know from this forum and others what our Subaru's are capable of off-road, whereas the Juke has yet to prove itself. Google is your friend! Find a Juke forum and see what people are saying!"

The mod team should take a good hard look at what you guys allow, and why you should allow it.    I mean, if you're at /r/FJCRUISER and post your rig on the road, it's still a picture of an FJ.

But if you post your battle wagon in your driveway on /r/BATTLEWAGON and it STOPS being a battle wagon... you see my point?

And what makes it a worthy photo? Does it have to be off road? What does off road mean? Two of those cars are off pavement, sure. But not off road in any meaningful sense.   Defining a battlewagon is extremely hard. Generally if the vehicle is built off of a car chassis and has a hatch, that usually will put it into a wagon class. Battlewagons don't need off-road mods though. Being off-road and doing off-road things is enough to classify as a post. Generally off-road is completely off the pavement and usually away from the pavement. This can be argued in different cases, but generally you know it when you see it. I would agree with you that the two wagons ""off-road"" are not off-road.   You mods have painted yourself in a corner by trying to define taste. Yeah, taste.

So you try to expand on that faint, fleeting idea of taste. You try to turn this nebulous phantasm of taste into concrete, tangible rules.   I wouldn't consider a Frankenstein looking wagon to be the definition by any means. To me a battlewagon is a wagon going off the beaten path and not worrying about blemishes or scratches. It's fighting your terrain with what you have.    So you have these rules that make sense, until they don't. Your list of rules: must be off road, displaying a new off road mod, ect seem like they keep everything in check, but you just end up bending the rules whenever, because unless you're one of the three guys with lifted, busted up, rusty awesome rigs, you have to be bending the rules to post here.   The rules are fairly cut out, but mud flaps are sort of in the same category as roof-racks. They're an off-road mod, but can be abused if the vehicle isn't doing anything. Sitting in a driveway with mud flaps doesn't make it relevant content. Being out on a trail/unimproved road is relevant or at least close.    I mean, if you're at /r/FJCRUISER and post your rig on the road, it's still a picture of an FJ. If you post a Jeep in your driveway at /r/JEEP it's still a picture of a jeep. But if you post your battle wagon in your driveway on /r/BATTLEWAGON and it STOPS being a battle wagon... you see my point?   Yeah, I do. We try to do what's best for the community as a whole. Defining it is tough and moderating it is tougher as there's a lot of variables in a post, including context.  The post in question here to me is within the rules, though. Maybe not by much, but for now it is within the bounds of the rules."

battlewagon,2v3oc1,TrevorsMailbox,19,Sat Feb 7 17:11:14 2015 UTC,"The electrical ground is the negative of the battery, the source. Since everything that is connected to the positive of the battery needs to make its way back to the source to complete the circuit, the OP has BONDED his chassis to key areas of the car's electrical and mechanical systems. This reduces the resistance of the return current on the car.   The purpose of this is to prevent voltages from things like the sparkplug choosing a path of high resistance through key parts of the engine resulting in electrolysis, corrosion of metal parts. By bonding these key parts to the chassis the electricity will flow by the path of less resistance and reduce this effect.   Subarus also have a tendency to allow voltages to flow through the coolant system as it becomes contaminated with dissimilar metals and can lead to headgasket issues. The original bonding system in some subarus is not enough to compensate for this problem so this mod is required."

battlewagon,2v3oc1,barre_chord_reality,2,Sun Feb 8 14:23:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks, good info in there. Ive since upgraded from my old outback but I think im going to pick up some of that coolant conditioner or Radweld in an attempt to keep the old girl a little healthier."
battlewagon,2v3oc1,JamesNonstop,1 point,Sun Feb 8 14:36:39 2015 UTC,"the coolant conditioner is just re-branded radweld. its just a bandaid for the issue and doesn't really solve anything but it doesn't hurt since subaru recommends it anyway. what is important is to use the right coolant type for the aluminum and to make sure there are no other coolant additives/contamination floating around in there.   I completely flushed my system, it took 10 gallons of distilled water to eventually get it clear, the trick is to keep riding it with straight water (in warm weather) with the cabin thermostat fully open on defrost, for a whole day. Every couple of hours let it cool down and open the drain valve on the bottom then keep replacing the fluid with distilled water.   Then once what comes out doesn't look like crap anymore put 100 percent antifreeze it in,( I mixed the conditioner bottle in the antifreeze bottle first and gave it a good shake since its pretty chunky). The entire system takes about 2 gallons so make sure you have taken at least 1 gallon of water out before you put the antifreeze in.  edit: Also its important to not stress the engine until all the air is bled out, since there is no bleed valve on old outbacks I left the radiator cap off and let the air slowly bleed out, every 15 minutes i would let the car idle for 5 minutes to let the waterpump kick in while filling it. It takes a while and it sucks but I can't find a better way without buying one of those 30 dollar special funnels.   Also the small plastic reservoir should not be filled, i made the mistake of putting way too much coolant in it and it made it more difficult to bleed the air out. The fill line is very low, its really there just to hold air  edit again: this is what i bought for 30$, it seems to be on sale  another edit: this is a healthy torrent that includes several subaru car manuals and factory guides  magnet:?xt=urn:btih:5be1b9a05ff1a744da3d522c590ba055dd4fe3a7&dn=Car+Repair+Manuals&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"

KC won't even post a light-pattern study on their website because they know no one would buy them if it wasn't for name recognition.    That being said, have you looked into an LED light bar? They can be found for pretty cheap these days (co-worker got one for his jeep for $180). They don't throw light as far as a driving-pattern light, but they do offer better area coverage due to multiple points of light production. They're also more forgiving of impact damage (rocks), temperature change (they're instant on, and don't have that warm-up period), and are usually lighter weight. Plus the mounting is easier.   Most every car in the Sno*Drift field (and rally-america in general) has switched to LED light bars these days. They're just better in every way than round lights.   That being said, lots of people are unloading used Hella Rally 4000 HID's, or even the rally 3000 HID's for cheap right now. The ebay knockoffs are pretty good, but you'll eventually have problems with the bulbs/ballasts like any knockoff HID kits that are out there.

Essentially put a lift block of your desired height at every point that the suspension, Engine and Transmission crossmember, control arms and every other piece of running gear bolts to the body.  You will have to built a custom lengthened steering shaft, extend your shift linkage, make custom radiator hoses and other wires that will not reach after the engine drops.  SJRLifts and a few others build kits that would fit your car but would still require you to make most of the custom modification yourself."

battlewagon,2ugniu,THEMCV,15,Mon Feb 2 01:06:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks all for the appreciation. To answer a few questions, wheels are Method Rally wheels, tires are Hankook RT03 215/75/15 MT, lift kit is a 4"" SJR lift kit (which was a miserable piece of kit to work with, missing lots of screws and bolts, ended up going to the hardware store several times). Suspension is KYB struts on King Springs standard height front/rear. Ditched the rear sway (springs are more then stiff enough it doesn't bother me), extended the shift linkage and steering shaft (have a talented welder/car fabricating guru do this for you, this part took most of the project time), had to fab some upper/lower radiator hoses, get a new airbox setup and tinker with a bunch of brake lines.   To the guy who mentioned that this is just as much ground clearance as a stock cherokee and got downvoted into oblivion and ultimately deleted, you guys should know his comment wasn't necessarily wrong. In fact there was a lot of merit to what he wrote. When I take this wheeling, because I don't have a solid axel I'll be out on the mud replacing axels every time these snap. Dual range swaps are more work then I want to put into it right now, but they do exist. Nevertheless there is merit behind owning a Subaru as well, mainly that I'm not dicking around with a Chrysler (I've owned two Jeeps, never again), parts are cheap and easy to come by, and did I mention I won't be dicking around with a Chrysler? Decent mileage, gets me thru mud and snow, and is relatively cheap and way more reliable then both of my Jeeps were. I'm more then happy with my Outback considering I have less money into it and the lift build then I did buying my entire Cherokee in the past.   Also threw on some UEL's, and dat rumble !"

battlewagon,2ugniu,iminyourtoaster,3,Mon Feb 2 23:02:43 2015 UTC,"It was a difficult kit to work with. The picture instructions include pretty lame disorienting pictures of the parts installed, and the parts in the pictures were the old versions of the parts. Previously SJR had been making the blocks in a C open ended shape because it was easier to stick a wrench/socket in and crank the pieces down, but those were bending so he's gone to a newer style block that's completely enclosed. You're supposed to flip the driveline bracket in the midshaft upside down and rebolt it in according to the pics, but we found that there simply wasn't enough room for the driveline to clear the rear subframe. Ended up using longer bolts and cutting some pipe as makeshift spacers.   Good luck with your future build, it took us about 2 days but we had 3 people working on it, all very experienced with subaru lifts, one was a very talented fabricater and was able to do the shift linkage magic and steering shaft magic for me."

battlewagon,2u4lpk,rwanders,4,Thu Jan 29 23:40:46 2015 UTC,"Not to downplay the vid, because it's awesome, but trucks that fail on that do so due to the driver. Specifically their foot and it's eagerness to pound the fuck out of the skinny pedal. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

battlewagon,2u4lpk,KevlarAllah,3,Fri Jan 30 02:22:59 2015 UTC,Seemed like a torque issue too. He had enough torque in the higher RPM's but I personally would have still been uncomfortable.

battlewagon,2u4lpk,BravoTeam127,2,Fri Jan 30 03:33:57 2015 UTC,Well yeah but your jeep (and mine) likely have a good amount of low end torque so all we need is a slight tap of the pedal.
battlewagon,2u4lpk,KevlarAllah,1 point,Fri Jan 30 12:26:32 2015 UTC,Yeah just mashing the gas pedal works but usually at the cost of body or drive train damage.  A competent driver should be technical enough to maneuver over obstacles such as this without having to spin like crazy.

battlewagon,2tuy14,NeilOMalley,3,Tue Jan 27 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"Not a silly question. I did a lot of research and was overwhelmed, some people were saying you need things like new swaybar endlinks, subframe spacers, etc. But I found out you just really need the shocks and forester trailing arms, and everything bolted in with sway bars intact. If I go any higher, thats when it starts getting complicated."

battlewagon,2tuy14,Danno_Squared,1 point,Tue Jan 27 20:58:01 2015 UTC,On a lifted car that will mostly see street a lot of people leave the sway bars on.  For rigs that get offroaded pretty hard you want to remove them to get as much articulation out of the suspension as possible to keep all 4 tires on surfaces for traction.
battlewagon,2tuy14,Danno_Squared,2,Tue Jan 27 21:05:14 2015 UTC,Imgur is refusing to load so if you put the answer on there sorry for asking.  How much of a lift was this for you? What parts exactly did you use?  How much did it cost for you to get the XT bits?  I've been looking at lifting my wagon an inch or two when I get new suspension bits but it can't be some $1500 lift like most of the setups I have been offered by vendors.
battlewagon,2tuy14,InTheBay,3,Thu Jan 29 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"Here is a pic of the height before http://i.imgur.com/CLDEzg5.jpg , I would say it was about an 1 1/2""-2"" lift.   I just used the shocks/struts from an XT and also the trailing arms, everything was bolt in. I got them from a subaru salvager on facebook.   I only paid $240 for used parts, but thats a pretty damn cheap suspension mod if you ask me! I had quite a few compliments already."

I'm getting my inspiration from @fuelyourgypsysoul on Instagram. I hand built my roof basket and it's been great! I wish I would've stained it though. Primitive Racing makes skid plates for everything under there. A lot of people use street signs as skid plates too."
battlewagon,2tocrf,voomanchu,2,Mon Jan 26 03:28:19 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/TentaclePron!  I can help you out! My 02 Outback is lifted with SJR's 2"" Lift Kit found here! and I have General Grabber AT2s.   The biggest advantage to going the King Spring route is the improved handling, but you get more total lift with the SJR lift.  215/65/16 is the largest you can fit without getting 0 offset rims (and going bigger you might need to lift more). You can fit this tire regardless of if you have a lift or not. Like I did before my lift!  Eventually I'd like to remove my bumper, but put a tube bumper like /u/Pizza_The_Hutt has pictured in the center picture of the banner.  I can't tell you much about stripping the interior. I carry people too much to do that. :c  Here's the rear differential skid plate from Primitive, front end skid plate, and (note that it takes some modifying of the exhaust shield and cutting the plate some yourself to get it to fit) transmission skid plate!.  I should also note that you cannot lift with any year Forester. The fronts for one model will fit, but the rears don't match any other. :(  Here's how my car sits at the moment, but more pictures in a few!"

battlewagon,2tocrf,Pizza_The_Hutt,3,Tue Jan 27 02:19:18 2015 UTC,"I stripped the interior of my gen1 and completely covered it from top to bottom with fatmat (dynamat).  It's easy to take everything apart and/or put back together, just takes time.  If you bedline it make sure you mask off important things like the wiring harness w/ connectors, the fuel pump door and screws, fuse box, etc.    My first wagon was a '95 Legacy and I completely gutted it and installed a roll cage.  The entire fusebox assembly located at the front driverside kick panel had to be moved.  Took about 2 days and something like 150 solder points, but I managed to get it relocated to where the stereo cluster is.  The biggest drawback to yanking the entire interior was no A/C or heater, which was the biggest reason I got rid of that car and got another one."

Newer vehicles that use HID headlamps use special reflector housings to ensure safe use, but your battlewagon probably doesn't have those.

I really wanted to put a snorkel on it, along with either a lift, or something. As of right now, I want to fix the rust and get it painted. It will most likely be a summer project, although I may take off the hood and test paint that in my garage to see how it would come out.

battlewagon,2t4in5,Pizza_The_Hutt,1 point,Wed Jan 21 22:11:28 2015 UTC,"You will need to buy the projector/housing prior to buying the HID's as all headlights are different sizes.  I think my JDM projectors on my Legacy use H1, while the 7"" off road lights use H3.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like there's a direct fit replacement for projectors on the '03 Forester, at least I can't find any after doing a quick search on google and ebay.  You may have to do some custom work.  Morimoto stuff is top of the line, but expensive.  Their customer service is great though, so you may shoot them an email and ask what they recommend for your vehicle.    https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=2003%20subaru%20forester%20projector%20headlights"
battlewagon,2t4in5,letsgotoarave,-1,Thu Jan 22 01:34:13 2015 UTC,"They don't necessarily look like crap, and if you get 35 Watt ballasts, you probably won't blind anyone either. However I got projectors for my 1998 car anyway. OP look at http://www.ddmtuning.com/ for decent price/quality replacement HID/LED kits for your car."
battlewagon,2t4in5,NeilOMalley,3,Wed Jan 21 05:23:40 2015 UTC,HIDs in stock halogen housings no matter the output will always be a bad idea.  If you are not going to retrofit projectors don't bother.  I hope they crack down on people running them and write them a huge ticket.  LEDs also are not that great of an improvement over halogens.
battlewagon,2t4in5,ItsPrimetime,6,Wed Jan 21 05:46:49 2015 UTC,"You're much better off getting a good set of halogen bulbs then slapping some HIDs in, as /u/Pizza_The_Hutt is saying.

battlewagon,2t4in5,k_ba,1 point,Wed Jan 21 20:45:11 2015 UTC,"By in large I agree with the other comments, but have also been closely watching LED headlights as they get brighter and cheaper.  In just the last year, they have come a LONG way.  Check Aliexpress for stupid cheap prices if you do decide to go LED.  Don't get ones that have fans as their only cooling sources, as burnt out LEDs happen instantly when the fan gets mudded up and stops cooling.  The newer ones all have humongous heat sinks too, so make sure you have clearance.  And post pics if you go for the LED option!"

This is generally accepted and what I've always put on my vehicles.  But between 1.5 - 2.0 GVWR is good.

All the springs are different so the vr6 auto wagon ones are still likely to give you are bit of a raise. If you can find the colored dots on yours it will tell you which ones they are and you can go from there. I just saw poly strut bushings too.

battlewagon,2ssd4e,youniformitarianist,1 point,Sun Jan 18 20:30:53 2015 UTC,When you say you don't have enough room to get the bottom mounted do you mean the control arm won't go down far enough for you to get the bolts through the strut and the knuckle?   My friend and I had this same problem when putting coilovers in his 02 wrx. We tried to put them in with only one side of the car jacked up at a time so the sway bar was keeping the control arm from moving down far enough because the other wheel was on the ground. Took me longer than I care to admit to figure that one.  If that's not it and the control arm still won't go down far enough you can try putting a pry bar on top of the control arm and under part of the subframe and pry the control arm down.  Good luck.

battlewagon,2shy4f,injulen,7,Thu Jan 15 13:38:22 2015 UTC,"FYI, I believe your car is a GF4 not an 8.   8 implies turbocharged, the 4 is the EJ22.  Also, dug out a picture and threw on a caption for you. You mentioned in another comment that it was a trailing arm but its the lateral link. Hopefully this clears it up a bit:  http://i.imgur.com/LDPLeGT.jpg  Also, I'm curious about your lateral links. As you can see in this photo, these ones match yours but they are from an 02. The rear one is a bar and the front one is a U-shaped tube. I believe this was the style on the 2002+ impreza, the pre-2001 was two solid bars and no u-shaped tube that I've ever seen. Did you or a previous owner at some point swap the lateral links to the newer style?"
battlewagon,2shy4f,injulen,5,Thu Jan 15 16:30:47 2015 UTC,That clears up a lot thankyou so much !!! Starting to make sense. I didn't replace anything and I'm not too sure about the previous owner.

battlewagon,2shy4f,injulen,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:34:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, interesting. Perhaps they started using the newer style lateral links down there sooner than here.   It's a 2.0 non-turbo though right? We never got a 2.0 non-turbo here in the States.  But yes since I didn't really say it in my first post, the bolt under the rubber cap is for adjusting your toe-in on the rear wheels. Although now I think about it I thought it was just the two bolts towards the rear of the car where the lateral links attach to the subframe and not all four. Hmmm."

battlewagon,2shy4f,Hooded00,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:47:24 2015 UTC,"I asked around some local subaru gurus and have been told that the rear bolt is the adjustment, the front one is just a normal bolt. But it is the front one that usually has the cap. So its not there to protect your alignment. Odd, eh?  http://i.imgur.com/MzvTk7I.jpg (#1 bolt is toe adjustment, #2 bolt is normal and just holds the lateral link on but is the one that comes with a cap for some reason. Maybe like /u/Pizza_The_Hutt said, its to prevent punctures to the gas tank in a collision)"
battlewagon,2shy4f,elislider,3,Thu Jan 15 21:11:56 2015 UTC,"On my '96 Legacy, it is just a rubber dust cap for the rear trailing arms.  It almost looks like it was intended to be a rubber buffer between the bolt and the fuel tank when there is a substantial rear end collision.  I didn't put them back on when I replaced my rear brakes when I went from drums to rotors."

I've got new TOYO's on there now that are a bit better for off-roading, but it's tough to find any decent off road tire for a 17"" that will fit between the fenders :/.  Any suggestions?  And backstory... well, one of the first times in the season that it rained hard enough for the mud to be really fun, and one of my favorite dirt roads tempted us when we drove past. Haha had some fun first though, had to walk around 3/4 of a mile in the rain, at night to get picked up by a buddy, who drove us home to get the pickup.

I wanted to buy some cheap steel 16"" rims and throw a set of off-roaders on there, but the front brakes (mine are stock, but I've been told they are the same rotors used in the WRX) are too damn big to fit anything but a rally wheel, which makes the whole project more expensive."

As far as battlewagonning it, how aggressive do you want to go?  You can get away with a 2 inch strut lift without having to body lift.  With 2 inches, you can squeeze on 26"" tires, which are a good height cause it's still fairly drivable with a 1.8.  Anything taller and you probably want an EJ22 conversion."

battlewagon,2ruevb,_meiki,2,Sat Jan 10 18:20:46 2015 UTC,"Drive it and maintain it. A stock 4wd with low range is still a very capable car. For starters I would put a bar on the front because Australian animals are suicidal. You might not have need for one, but I would recommend one that doesn't reduce your front clearance if you decide to get one. One you have been off roading in it, you may decide you want more from it and then you can get a lift and some bigger tyres."

battlewagon,2rtbtc,THEMCV,2,Fri Jan 9 04:32:04 2015 UTC,Not super expensive compared to the larger sizes. $120 a tire wasn't too bad compared to about twice that much for my 32x11.50s I have on my 4runner.

battlewagon,2rlmxf,THEMCV,3,Wed Jan 7 06:16:17 2015 UTC,"Oreilly's lifetime warranty axles for-the-win!  Mine get swapped out about once a year.  You sure get really good at the swap, too, lol.  Takes me maybe half an hour for both.  And it's so nice to have both axles be the same, as you lose track of which axle is which warranty.  If I were gonna go on long-distance drives, I'd get an EMPI axle, as the folks on USMB swear by them.  However, they only have a 1 year warranty, and since I usually stick close to home, don't mind swapping them out every other oil change.  And besides, you can always limp home by putting it in 4 wheel drive.  Just keep a roll of bailing wire in your trunk so you can tie up any loose axles. ;)"
battlewagon,2rlmxf,THEMCV,1 point,Wed Jan 7 08:09:24 2015 UTC,The EMPI is cheaper than the ToughOne! I might get that....  Or O'Reilly's. No more Advance axles though!
battlewagon,2rlmxf,THEMCV,2,Fri Jan 9 04:34:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ToughOne has been a terribly made axle. NAPA might be my next up.   Definitely. Someday I'll have a second vehicle, but that's a long ways away. And yeah, you've got a really nice truck! I did not know about the SHO!"
battlewagon,2rlmxf,THEMCV,2,Wed Jan 7 06:33:13 2015 UTC,"A few people have had decent luck with the NAPA axles.  Could even look around and see if anyone has any recommendations.  Yeah the SHO haha, its a 1993 5-speed Emerald Green with Black Leather interior.  Pretty fun car, kind of a pain to maintain though lol.  It definitely has been on the back burner lately.  Once I get the Wagon back on the road and finish my new computer build I will start putting some more funds into it, and then maybe the Dart too, and my Motorcycle.  I have too many cars and projects.  1993 Taurus SHO"
battlewagon,2rlmxf,Cyfun06,2,Wed Jan 7 06:51:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I need to hunt around a lot more. OEM would be best.  Nice! What kind of power does that put down?"

battlewagon,2qz9fd,jnymoen,1 point,Tue Jan 13 02:04:30 2015 UTC,The main thing that angers me with my moms 2013 cr-v is that it disengages awd if you spin the tires fast enough which is really weird.  The earlier cr-v didn't do that but it was still (seemingly) heavily biased to the front.  Much better back then as they weren't running such low profile tires on it.
battlewagon,2qz9fd,rheadtdeirt,1 point,Tue Jan 13 12:28:24 2015 UTC,Oh I understand. They put AWD without a proper slip dif. Hopefully they'll fix that on newer models.

It's on its 4th replacmeent windshield (so 5, if you include the original).  At first, we replaced it for every ""long"" crack, but after two, we just decided to install a new one every spring, or when we get something that blocks the drivers view.  It has 2 or 3 chips right now.  Across all of my cars, I think I've bought 7 windshields, and every one of them has at least one chip in it now.

battlewagon,2qug95,PigSlam,0,Tue Dec 30 21:08:14 2014 UTC,"It's not that, it's the triple joints, the weather stripping area and the strut tower in the rear that all retains moisture, salt, dirt and all that shit that makes it corrode so much. All three of my subies have suffered from some kind of corrosion, it's almost impossible to find one with no corrosion. However, my first wagon (godbless its soul, it has departed from this world July 14 2014) was the best, it only had rot in the rear quarter panel, nowhere else, paint was mint, 245 thousand clicks, what a beast... miss it every day haha."
battlewagon,2qug95,tyguyS4,3,Wed Dec 31 17:32:03 2014 UTC,I had a 96 legacy wagon where I could poke the rear seat cushion from underneath the car. Had to lift it from the rear subframe brace because the pinch weld was completely gone.
battlewagon,2qug95,PigSlam,2,Tue Dec 30 22:20:21 2014 UTC,"I used to work at a tire shop in Rochester, NY.  All of our lifts were just a simple platform that would lift the cars high enough to get the tires off the ground. It was just a rubber lined platform that would hit the pinch welds.  Whenever we'd do this with a car of any age, we'd hear the sound my manager called ""snap, crackle, pop,"" from the rusted pinch welds crumbling.  This was in 2001, so most of these cars were mid-late 1990s vehicles, but they didn't have to be very old, or have much noticeable rust for it to happen."

battlewagon,2qug95,kstorm88,1 point,Tue Dec 30 21:20:49 2014 UTC,"This happens because of a shitty windshield job. Car came from BC and went across Canada so my guess is the windshield was changed by an amateur or something and shit got trapped between the seal and the metal and started rotting it from there... at least it's just surface rust, that's all for the a-pillars.

battlewagon,2q21d1,ashowofhands,2,Mon Dec 22 19:16:19 2014 UTC,"You have an observant eye...when I first read this I was thinking, ""man I didn't say anything about a sunroof, did I?"" But I guess it's barely peaking out in that picture.   The answer is: special order from the factory. Really wanted a manual but the premium trim (one step up from the base) had a lot of other stuff that I wanted. And turns out, although practically 0 exist in the U.S., you can get them ordered because the manual is still technically available on the premium trim, which comes with sunroof, powered driver seat and a couple other features."
battlewagon,2q21d1,MustTurnLeftOnRed,2,Mon Dec 22 19:32:20 2014 UTC,"That's interesting.  I know you can get the premium with a sunroof or a manual, but if you try to ""build your own"" on the Subaru website you can't have both at the same time.  Not sure why Subaru thinks people who drive manuals don't want sunroofs but it's been like that on many of their models recently (including the Outback).  Good to know that you can technically do a cutsom-order like that.  I wonder just how custom you can get (if you're willing to pay the price)?  I briefly toyed with the idea of getting a Webasto sunroof for my Outback but I thought and thought and thought some more and decided that I didn't really want to pay $1500 to have someone cut a hole in the roof of my car.  Oh well.  If you feel like selling your Forester in like, 6-8 years, let me know :P"
battlewagon,2q23v5,forgotmyredditagain,3,Mon Dec 22 10:22:18 2014 UTC,"Hm. Good question. There would be two places to stow it, and each offers a different approach. If it stows in the hatch, above the spare tyre, it'd be fairly easy. It could just be a hinged strip mounted in the spare area. Open hatch, unfold it out, and done.  If you want it to stow under the car, it'll be a little more challenging, but once you figure out how to mount it (and prevent it from releasing unintentionally) the hard part is done. You'd need a track on either side, but the rest will take a little imagination.  I'd favor the first approach. You don't have to sacrifice any ground clearance, you don't have to worry about it releasing unintentionally, and it will last longer when not exposed."
battlewagon,2q23v5,teamwrk,3,Mon Dec 22 13:06:35 2014 UTC,"I think the ""Fold out of the spare tire well"" is the way to go. Imagine a compartment full of little wheels with little bearings on a little track thats exposed to the outside. Especially in a wagon meant for some off road shenanigans. I'm just picturing bearings packed with dirt, and a compartment filling with water and rust."
battlewagon,2q23v5,KiboshWasabi,3,Mon Dec 22 14:48:37 2014 UTC,"How does the ""fold out of the spare tire well"" work though? If the dog is in the back, it'll be standing on the ramp.  If the dog is outside of the car, then the owner will deploy the ramp, the dog would walk on, and then the owner would have to fold the ramp over the dog.  Imprezas aren't very tall cars, even when lifted (they're still shorter than a stock Jeep, or pickup truck).  I'd recommend simply lifting the dog in and out."
battlewagon,2q23v5,PigSlam,3,Mon Dec 22 16:08:15 2014 UTC,"the ramp would not need to be the full width, and could replace part of the compartment cover, and fold in multiple sections."
battlewagon,2q23v5,chrwei,2,Mon Dec 22 16:56:20 2014 UTC,"Obviously the most practical solution is to lift the dog. But we're not just looking at practical are we? The easiest way would be for the ramp tp be as narrow as feasible. Have the first hinge move the entire set to one side, and the unfold with opposing hinges til it reach the ground."
battlewagon,2q23v5,KiboshWasabi,2,Mon Dec 22 17:49:30 2014 UTC,"I think I'd make it go the other way - unfold to the ground, and then open width-wise to make it more usable for the dog.  That way, the part that folds into the car is as small as possible, and less likely to interfere with the load/passenger when putting it away."
battlewagon,2q23v5,PigSlam,2,Mon Dec 22 17:52:22 2014 UTC,"No mechanical knowledge here...  but - what if it hinged somewhere on the bumper? It would/could almost sit on the end of your car like a spare tire Instead of being hinged vertically and pivoting horizontally, you could hinge the ramp horizontally and pivot it vertically. You would have to lower the ramp to open your trunk - but in the up position, you could have a simple pin that holds the hinge thus leaving the ramp up. When the ramp is down, hypothetically your dog would have a small step from the top of the ramp, over the hinge into the trunk."

battlewagon,2pgd35,KiboshWasabi,11,Tue Dec 16 09:22:22 2014 UTC,It's not there because the rear diff is welded and would snap gears or axles on pavement.
battlewagon,2pgd35,b-hop,5,Tue Dec 16 10:20:53 2014 UTC,"I figured that much what I mean is it is actually there. It looks like its only disconnected from the diff, and still connected to the hub, which seems dangerous."

battlewagon,2pgd35,kevinpdx,9,Tue Dec 16 17:16:07 2014 UTC,"Because the rear diff is welded. That means permanently locked and it doesn't allow rear wheels to spin at different speeds. Good off the road, axle rape on the road."

Apart from added driveline stress and the rear wheels sliding around, the tyres also wear out very fast."
battlewagon,2pgd35,kevinpdx,5,Wed Dec 17 08:30:49 2014 UTC,"It wouldn't snap until you tried to turn a corner. Since the outside wheel has to turn faster in a turn, if the differential is welded, the axle becomes the weakest link and will break. If it doesn't break, the inside wheel will hop and chirp as you go around a bend."

battlewagon,2p7ley,kstorm88,5,Sat Dec 13 22:52:17 2014 UTC,For those curious about the viability of the plow https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&ei=XxaNVNHdBZKOyASR1YCADA&url=http://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmP2anv3EZyc&ved=0CB0QtwIwAA&usg=AFQjCNEmajc8y5W1-6RYcXKNHqDuqOCQkg
battlewagon,2p7ley,adudeguyman,2,Sun Dec 14 04:49:02 2014 UTC,The plow I had on my Ranger was probably 10 times heavier than that.   It was so heavy that I had to have air bags in the front coil springs to keep the front end up. It would have torn through that snow in the video in no time.  I think the weight of the plow keeps it down in the snow more and makes it more effective.
battlewagon,2p7ley,dj_dealwithit64,3,Sun Dec 14 05:00:55 2014 UTC,You have to remember it's still a car. But it does an exceptional job plowing. I think of it as a UTV with heat and stereo haha
battlewagon,2p7ley,Social_Hazard,2,Sun Dec 14 05:22:41 2014 UTC,"I love it. It's not for commercial use or anything, but for what you use it for, it works, and that's what it's for. Mr. Ford Ranger is taking this too seriously, it does what it's supposed to and furthermore, it perpetuates the idea of the utilitarian Subaru. Kudos brother."
battlewagon,2p7ley,adudeguyman,2,Sun Dec 14 07:15:54 2014 UTC,"Op, I have multiple vehicles for different purposes. You have found a way to make one vehicle for all purposes. I am truly impressed."
battlewagon,2p7ley,Cyfun06,2,Sun Dec 14 14:36:38 2014 UTC,Can you actually plow snow with that?
battlewagon,2p7ley,adudeguyman,5,Sat Dec 13 23:50:07 2014 UTC,"That's what she said.  Seriously, though, lots of people use old soobies as plows.  Their lack of weight, power, and traction keeps them from thrashing their transfer case.  And their tight turning circle comes in very handy.  My local sooby mechanic/used sooby dealer has a plow on an ea71 brat.  It's fucking adorable."
battlewagon,2p7ley,sexygingergod,1 point,Sun Dec 14 02:59:38 2014 UTC,I don't recognize that type of plow setup.  Is it for a 4wheeler?  Does it just go up and down or can you turn it to the side?  I plowed with a Ford Ranger and thought that was small for a plow.

battlewagon,2ot3y9,tornato7,11,Tue Dec 9 23:45:09 2014 UTC,I think the trip computer may go off the odo so that could be it.  It also could be because you are driving better as larger tires slow acceleration a bit.  Or maybe the stock tires were just crap and you are getting better mpg :)
battlewagon,2ot3y9,Im_Done_Thats_It,6,Tue Dec 9 23:54:04 2014 UTC,"I think most forester owners agree that the stock tire is crap, the Yokohama G91F has something like 1 star out of 50 reviews on every tire website. Only advantage I've found is that there's basically no tread wear after 18,000mi."
battlewagon,2ot3y9,Maschinenbau,7,Wed Dec 10 08:17:46 2014 UTC,"Larger tires basically lower your final drive ratio. It's like putting taller gears in your axle. For the same given speed on the road, your engine will have lower RPMs with larger tires. This doesn't necessarily translate to better economy, but it often does.   Don't forget when doing economy calculations to scale your MPG value to the difference in tire circumference. Try it: http://www.miata.net/garage/tirecalc.html  For example when I swapped wheels/tires in my Saturn I went from 205/55-16 to 235/45-17, which increased the tire circumference by 1.8%. This means when my car tells me I'm getting 30 mpg, I'm actually getting 30*1.018 mpg. For every 100 miles my car thinks I went, I actually did 101.8 miles."
battlewagon,2ot3y9,ToMetric,4,Wed Dec 10 01:07:18 2014 UTC,100 miles = 160.9 km  101.8 miles = 163.8308 km  feedback
battlewagon,2ot3y9,ReptarSonOfGodzilla,3,Wed Dec 10 01:07:29 2014 UTC,"I'm aware of both factors, but do you know if the changed final drive ratio will have any effect on an automatic CVT? I think the transmission may simply change ratios slightly to compensate."
battlewagon,2ot3y9,KiboshWasabi,5,Wed Dec 10 08:15:19 2014 UTC,"I got better MPG when switching from my 205/55/16, to my 215/65/16s. I think my in town went down slightly, but freeway is now better by about 1.5mpgs."
battlewagon,2ot3y9,Cyfun06,3,Thu Dec 11 06:29:37 2014 UTC,"Let's see, larger tires would report a slow MPH to the Speedo which in turn would report fewer miles on the tripo per tank. So unless theres something bizarre and complex with the intellignt component reaction than you're probably actually better than +.5 even."

You might need to realign the rear wheel with forester subframe spacers or an adjustable trailing arm.   I had a 2012 WRX and did all the research to lift it.... but I then bought a truck instead...worst mistake ever.

Lights that are mounted below your bumper will not be able to project beyond changes in ground elevation.  Have you thought about mounting a light bar (or individual lights) behind your grille?

battlewagon,2ookf0,chrwei,1 point,Tue Dec 9 12:41:48 2014 UTC,"ah. I thought you were worried about the amount of work involved. If drilling into the roof scares you, I understand that. You could always drill the hole in a way that the stock roof rack (if you have one) covers the hole? Or, you could do what most emergency vehicle builders do and drill a bigger hole (take a breath and keep reading :)), and use a rubber grommet (which really is the right way to do it). Then, if you want to revert things you just use a rubber plug w/ some silicone to hold it in place. If done right, it'll look fine. Another option would be to run the wires up the a-pillar, behind the windshield weather stripping but this isn't the best option imo."

battlewagon,2olnxu,Llama-drama,3,Mon Dec 8 12:16:20 2014 UTC,"Correct! I think the General Grabber AT2 is the next smallest AT tire for a 14"" wheel with a 1"" inch larger diameter. Now in countries outside of the US tiny 14"" mud tires are way more prevalent. But no DOT rating so no importing them.  Bonus, I think the white lettering on the BFG looks better than the General."

battlewagon,2ol0kc,Rilnac,5,Sun Dec 7 21:29:01 2014 UTC,"People often ask what the biggest tires 'X' lift will let them fit. I often chime in that the biggest hindrance won't be your fenders but instead the strut itself. I finally got around to getting some pictures from within the wheel well to help illustrate. I'll snap the same pics of the grabbers once spring hits, but they have virtually identical clearance to these. I should also note, these tires are on 17x7 rims with an offset of 40, which according to tire calculator actually gives extra clearance on the inside vs stock (keep this in mind when planing your clearance).   For summer I run Grabber AT2 215_65r16.  Anyhoo, as you can see the front has tons of space. The rears on the other hand end up cutting it real close, as always you will want some space for flex.

battlewagon,2odxlj,llgreenbean,2,Fri Dec 5 18:48:05 2014 UTC,"Head gaskets are pretty easy.  While you're in there replace the timing belt and tensioners, possibly the water pump if it looks old.  They are gutless wonders but are way easier and cheaper to modify than newer rigs.  Depends on your location too as they are starting to get harder to find for replacement parts.  The 90-94 only had the single range 4WD transmission not the Dual Range like in the GLs though you can swap one in.  As long as it relatively rust free you should be good to go."
battlewagon,2odxlj,NeilOMalley,1 point,Fri Dec 5 22:23:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks, its in north Carolina so its pretty rust free and only 500 bucks. I found an 83 GL thats pretty rust free with either a newer engine or turbo in it, they want 1500 which is pretty nice seeing as tho the only issue seems to be faded paint."

battlewagon,2o8a46,dj_dealwithit64,2,Thu Dec 4 07:29:09 2014 UTC,"Took my headliner out which was surprisingly really easy, cleaned it off a bit, then I picked up some stuff called Permatex Heavy Duty Headliner And Carpet Adhesive from O'Reilly and then went to a fabric store and had to find fabric I could like that was also long enough and wide enough. This fabric was about as cool as I could find. I was wanting to do like planets and spaceships but they didn't have anything that big. It's definitely a two man job though, that adhesive is crazy sticky so if you make an error it takes a lot of time and effort to correct it. I attacked it one half at a time lengthwise. It dried in like 5 minutes and then I threw it back in my car. Kinda stunk in there for awhile and I didn't put enough adhesive on certain spots but nothing noticeable. One can was perfect, it says to spray both the headliner and the fabric, but trust me you only need to spray the headliner haha."

I'm going to be in the car market soon and I'm leaning pretty heavily towards a crosstrek, but I love audi wagons.

battlewagon,2o2exl,barre_chord_reality,8,Tue Dec 2 20:43:00 2014 UTC,"I would say you have to be somewhat mechanically inclined and have access to a garage/tools to make it a viable option. Your main worry will be replacing the airbags at a certain point and doing the timing belt if it is around 100k and hasn't been done yet. On top of that there are the random fixes here and there which aren't so bad if you are willing to do yourself, its when you start having to pay someone that it starts looking less and less viable to own one.   Honestly thoufh I got mine for very cheap because it had a total title and the guy selling it to me was my brother so I knew the good and the bad of the car. I would be very skeptical buying one if I didn't have a fairly comprehensive history. Good luck!"

battlewagon,2o3m6g,dj_dealwithit64,3,Wed Dec 3 00:03:32 2014 UTC,"I had a 2000 obs, from what I gathered your best option was swapping in some forester struts/Springs with the longer trailing arms. Or you could go the direction of spacers. Pretty easy to fabricate out of HDPE or you could spend some money and buy them online"
battlewagon,2o3m6g,ssschillings,1 point,Wed Dec 3 00:46:14 2014 UTC,"From what I've gathered, Forester struts require some fab work to go into the Impreza top hats. Also I've recently purchased new KYB struts so I'd rather keep them. Definitely considering spacers as an alternative though. Gorilla offroad has a set for only $100, and I could definitely spare that."
battlewagon,2o3m6g,brzcory,4,Wed Dec 3 01:04:08 2014 UTC,"As someone rocking the fozzie struts, they do not require any fab work.   You just swap the fozzie strut for the impreza strut, re-use the impreza springs, top perch, top hats. and ta-da. Should take you all of an hour or so to swap them on.   The problem comes from the non-adjustable camber in the rear, hence the need for longer lateral links. I got ebay adjustable ones (which have the added benefit of adjustable trailing arms, so that you can re-center the wheel in the wheel well, as lifting it pushes it forward)."

battlewagon,2nx81a,Maschinenbau,3,Mon Dec 1 09:26:18 2014 UTC,How are most people's Subarus set up? I'm guessing most of you lock the rear and maybe center differential. What about the front one? I noticed many of you pull rear axles for driving on the road. Just trying to get a feel for what works with these rigs.
battlewagon,2nx81a,NeilOMalley,3,Mon Dec 1 17:25:12 2014 UTC,"Most guys use a small suspension or a bigger suspension/body lift kit such as my 6/4"".  Most all our rigs have Dual Range transmissions which is 4WD instead of AWD so no center diff like newer Subarus.  We all weld the rear diffs.  As Nick said they are a must as they increase traction greatly.  Front diffs remain open as there is no such thing as a locker for them and welding it would make it impossible to drive.  A lot of guys pull rear axles to relieve tire and axle wear.  I never do it but I don't street mine as much anymore."
battlewagon,2nx81a,Maschinenbau,1 point,Tue Dec 2 03:19:13 2014 UTC,Yeah welded rears are a must.

battlewagon,2nx81a,kstorm88,2,Tue Dec 2 02:28:44 2014 UTC,"I used to run all these trails with a 2"" lift and 27"" tires. You can do it but as you can tell from my doors and rockers, its kinda hard on things."
battlewagon,2nx81a,NeilOMalley,2,Tue Dec 2 03:13:38 2014 UTC,"Yeah you should see the underside of my car... also my gas tank probably has about half of the original capacity, because it is bashed in hard... I don't even know how fuel still flows... I've always had a question that maybe you can answer: as far as wheels and rub is concerned, is it better to have a wheel with larger back spacing or a wheel that has a deeper dish and sticks out wider? For example would a Toyota wheel or an old Chevy wheel be better? I'd like to fit a 28"" tire with my 2.5"" lift. I have bfh's and cutoff wheels, and I'm not afraid because the car is getting so rusted underneath that its borderline unsafe. Thanks for the advice in advance!"
battlewagon,2nx81a,kstorm88,2,Tue Dec 2 04:08:52 2014 UTC,"Well you kinda have that backwards.  A wheel with a high back spacing would stick our further while a deeper wheel with more positive offset would be deeper and would move the tire further in.  Positive=Inward Negative=Outward.  It would all depend on what you want to do.  A wheel with negative offset would push the tire further out making the swing larger when steering which will cause you to cut and bash more and can cause more stress on wheel bearings.  A more positive offset wheel would bring them in and I know with a close to stock offset and 27"" tires there is almost no cutting required with a 2"" lift.  Would just depend on whether you wanted to 6 lug swap or drill wheels or find some Peugeots."
battlewagon,2nx81a,Maschinenbau,1 point,Tue Dec 2 05:50:48 2014 UTC,"Is it the firewall of the inner fender that  needs more bashing? I can see if it was the firewall it would be better to have a smaller back spacing because you would want less swing. If it was the inner fender that needs more bashing a larger back spacing would be more advantageous. Basically if I have a 2.5"" lift with 28s, that would be the same as a 2"" lift with 27s"

battlewagon,2nsn8v,THEMCV,3,Sat Nov 29 23:13:42 2014 UTC,Lucky! I bet the size above mine is where they start putting the white on. :(   They really do look amazing. :) I can't wait to see them in action. ;)
battlewagon,2nsn8v,THEMCV,2,Sat Nov 29 23:25:49 2014 UTC,"Lost all my funds buying those tires. Barely made it home, so low on gas hahah. When I get some gas and that rear strut spacer I'm gonna go crawl around the mountains all day!"
battlewagon,2nsn8v,THEMCV,1 point,Sat Nov 29 23:27:32 2014 UTC,I understand completely. What did you end up lifting with? And what are you planning for the rear?
battlewagon,2nsn8v,THEMCV,1 point,Sun Nov 30 00:02:40 2014 UTC,"2006 Forester suspension bolted right up, that's all I have on there right now. Paranoid Fabrications has the cheapest strut spacers I've ever come by, so I'm gonna go with a 1"" spacer for the rear because the front is about 29 inches and 3 quarters tall from the ground and the rear is about 28 and a half inches from the ground. Unfortunately he only makes 1 inch spacers, but it will hardly be noticeable!"
battlewagon,2nsn8v,slotard,1 point,Sun Nov 30 00:11:23 2014 UTC,"Okay, awesome! Will you have issues adding on height with the Forester suspension already swapped? I know I can't go any higher without dropping the subframe."
battlewagon,2nsn8v,slotard,1 point,Sun Nov 30 00:25:05 2014 UTC,I don't think I will have to. When I try to wrap my mind around it I think of it as the strut staying in the same place but I'm lifting the body up. And if the subframe is on the body and not the chassis then I guess that makes sense
battlewagon,2nsn8v,Shittypumpkin2,1 point,Sun Nov 30 00:30:23 2014 UTC,I'm not sure. I would just be sure before just in case. :)

battlewagon,2nsn8v,SneakyLoner,1 point,Sun Nov 30 00:42:09 2014 UTC,"The front should be a little higher from the ground because the front tires need more clearance. Before you buy the spacers, take a look at the height of the frame rail rather than the fenders."
battlewagon,2nsn8v,THEMCV,1 point,Sun Nov 30 20:14:13 2014 UTC,Where would that be located
battlewagon,2nsn8v,nocorn91oct,1 point,Sun Nov 30 22:41:35 2014 UTC,There's a little lip that runs from just behind the front wheel well to just in front of the rear wheel well. Look for a part of it that isn't dented up.

I'm pretty happy with the performance so far(mostly on-road, but some gravel roads).  My tire guy said I may have some rubbing in the wheel wells, but I haven't noticed any yet.  Edit:  forgot to mention, I've been on ice and snow the whole time with the discoverers."
battlewagon,2nsj8u,Akski,2,Sat Nov 29 22:54:23 2014 UTC,"I always will recommend General Grabber AT2s since they're an extremely versatile tire, but I'm not sure that they make a size that will fit your Forester for a 17"" rim. :(  You can check the other sizes here. :)"
battlewagon,2nsj8u,THEMCV,2,Sat Nov 29 23:08:20 2014 UTC,If you are in an actually snowy climate the AT2s will literally kill you. The rubber is far to rigid for ice. I run grabbers in the summer and xice3s in the winter.
battlewagon,2nsj8u,Rilnac,1 point,Sat Nov 29 23:34:18 2014 UTC,"Really? Huh. My friend running them never had an issue, but I've never been able to run snows so I guess my comparison is skewed."
battlewagon,2nsj8u,THEMCV,2,Sun Nov 30 00:04:58 2014 UTC,I think it really comes down to the climate/road conditions. Melting snow is pretty much fine. Any ice and you have a disaster.
battlewagon,2nsj8u,Rilnac,1 point,Sun Nov 30 00:51:52 2014 UTC,"Yeah, we didn't have a ton of ice so we did okay. Better than all seasons though. :p"
battlewagon,2nsj8u,THEMCV,1 point,Sun Nov 30 01:01:23 2014 UTC,Really? Their site says that certain sizes are rated for severe snow and winter use.
battlewagon,2nsj8u,Rilnac,2,Sun Nov 30 00:18:14 2014 UTC,"Well for reference I am up in Winnipeg. I still had the grabbers on when we had our first snow a few weeks back (I actually had to go pickup my winters during it). The difference is insane, I was completely sideways on the grabbers, multiple times. Put the xice on, couldn't lose traction if I tried. I would say they are easily worse than all seasons."
battlewagon,2nsj8u,pdxrover,1 point,Sun Nov 30 00:50:25 2014 UTC,"All right, so much for that idea. I live in northern Illinois, so winter can get ugly here. My all-seasons work fine when the roads have been taken care of, but there are times when I would love something much more aggressive for snow and ice."
battlewagon,2nsj8u,dlundy09,2,Sun Nov 30 01:09:25 2014 UTC,"You'll be fine with the AT2s. They are rated m+s and even have pretapped holes for studs if you so desire.  Yes, they have a compound designed for warmer climates and will get pretty hard in the dead of winter in the Canadian Great Plains. For Illinois, they are a perfect a/t tire.   Update: if you already have a nice set of summer tires, totally go with xice. There is no comparison to a nice snow and ice tire."

If you get the LSD unit itself, then you'll have to swap it in from your current one, if your diff is an R180."

Just about everything else is unique to that platform and trim level.  They are also getting to be old enough that Honda no longer produces parts for them and inventory is disappearing.

battlewagon,2n0mv9,YummierGore,5,Mon Nov 24 22:05:08 2014 UTC,"Make sure they have already done the timing belt. Is it a 2.2L or a 2.5L?  Do you live in an area that gets a fair amount of rust? If you do, always check the rear subframe because that seems to be the first critical component to rust out.   Check for odd tire wear as that will be a sign that some suspension maintenance is needed."
battlewagon,2n0mv9,injulen,4,Fri Nov 21 20:43:04 2014 UTC,"As Harry said, the 2.5 DOHC has head gasket issues. It costs about 1200-2000 to replace them, but if done properly, shouldn't need to be fixed again.  Timing belt should have been done at 105k, but it's easy to DIY (costs maybe 200-300 in parts).  The rear quarter panel behind the wheel well is usually the first spot to rust. A little bit of paint bubbling or flaked off is par for the course, and easy to wire-wheel back and hit with some paint. Anything worse is probably a no-go unless you want to have new metal welded in."

Throwing a code for MAF sensor so not smoggable/road legal right now. I get it out and throw it around on my dirt track every few weeks.  I might replace the RT4WD with this thing as my adventuremobile if I get around to fixing MAF/Airbag lights/oil leak. Seems more... solid than the Civic and is definitely a bit more capable.

For making the bolt pattern line up (specifically the rear), wouldn't it not really matter, since I could just use the stock top mounting plate? I'm sure I'd have to make modifications, but they wouldn't be too bad.   Like, the stock shocks are roughly 24"" (decompressed) in the back. I could get some replacements that are maybe 26"" and a similar compression rate, swap the bottom perch, and then bolt it up to the stock plate."

The post that you're referencing is allowed since he was off-road. It's not always what your car has done to it, but rather what you're doing in it.  I think that if you had posted the same Allroad and it was doing something off-road, then it would have been perceived better.  Subarus definitely are more prevalent here, but by no means are we a Subaru only subreddit. :)"
battlewagon,2mskvy,reallifedog,2,Wed Nov 19 20:15:28 2014 UTC,"It does seem like the most popular ""battlewagons"" here are subarus with +1 oversized tires and mild if any suspension lift. I personally like your car and appreciate the imagination, maybe you just happened to post at a bad time where it was overlooked. When I get my current car in lifted winter mode I'll post a picture."
battlewagon,2mskvy,_gecko45,2,Wed Nov 19 19:24:17 2014 UTC,"Speculation: My only guess for your particular post is that an Allroad is too new/fancy and not enough ""battle"". Not that it isnt capable (I love Allroads, they're arguably more capable than a comparable Outback) but because it doesnt have that gruff, beat-up, ""used"" look. My assumption is that people here ""want"" basic-bitch cars (90s and earlier Subarus, etc) lifted and beat to hell, because they've actually been in battle.  So the question seems to be, has your car been in battle? If not, then it better be really built/fabbed to gain some cred. Because the 88 Loyales are getting more battle time than an 08 Allroad. People here are more likely to say ""that's cute"" to the Allroad.  this sub is invariably going to be tailored to everyday mom cars that have been taken to the extreme. a Jeep is not a mom-wagon, so its not a relevant here"

battlewagon,2mskvy,_gecko45,2,Wed Nov 19 20:39:55 2014 UTC,"I personally was not interested in your post because it was not YOUR wagon. Same goes for all the posts of that type. The posts ""Hey look at this wagon I found over on this other sub!"" do not work for me. They do not showcase ones imagination and hard work that goes into producing a battle wagon. We aren't able to ask YOU the technical questions about the hows and the whys because again it is not YOUR battle wagon.  Sure there are a lot of Subarus on here, they produced the majority of the AWD/4WD wagons. And they are cheap. But I hardly feel like this is a Subaru exclusive club. My civic wagon got plenty of love here and I plan to return with plenty of pictures and information as the battle wagon mods continue."

That being said, why did you post a pic of your civic in at a gas station?"
battlewagon,2mskvy,_gecko45,2,Wed Nov 19 21:26:28 2014 UTC,"Cause that was the first stop after getting it back on the road? I think it was 10:30 at night and they had enough light for a quick picture.  I have the new lift installed and aligned, just need to go get some pictures."

There is nothing inherently wrong with that, but of course, everyone takes it as a negative and if you think so, too, maybe because there is something wrong with the homogeneous nature of this sub.

Front page rotates pretty frequently; that's the nature of the site. Looking at a snapshot of the sub may be insightful, but is a poor indicator the larger picture.   That's this sub's population.   That's a portion of this sub's population. Granted, it's a large portion if we're talking about percent of submissions, but we have no intention of dismissing other manufacturers. Content submission is entirely user-driven. If you want to see more variety then round up users from other subs, drum up content from elsewhere. It'd be a much welcome addition to see more stuff from other manufacturers.   everyone takes it as a negative   Sweeping and misinformed generalization.   and if you think so, too, maybe because there is something wrong with the homogeneous nature of this sub   I don't. I enjoy seeing just about everything that comes across the counter here. I enjoy seeing people have fun with their cars. I enjoy seeing the connections people make and the conversations they have.   I'm just making observations that are rustling ya'll's jimmies.   No, you're intent on bringing negative bullshit into this sub and you've made that readily apparent. I welcome a serious conversation but I've yet to see you contribute a single solution, suggestion or anything other than a complaint, many of them unfounded.   So take from this what you will.

They are an oversized mudflap that bolts into the stock mudflap location. Basically both Rally Armors and Rok Blokz are a great addition to any vehicle because it protects your car from road spray and debris. I put mine on to keep some of the salt off of the side of my car during the winter. Rok Blokz are made of a harder plastic, so they resist bending and flexing, and are very durable. Rally Armors are made or a rubbery plastic that will flap and move around while driving. Both are very good choices but Rok Blokz are cheaper.""  http://www.rokblokz.com/  http://www.rallyarmor.com/"

battlewagon,2mpped,voomanchu,8,Tue Nov 18 23:09:58 2014 UTC,"Pretty much a spacer at every point the running gear bolts to the body and extending the steering, shifting and all hoses and wires.  Same way I did my car. This is probably a 8-10"" lift."
battlewagon,2mpped,NeilOMalley,7,Wed Nov 19 04:12:53 2014 UTC,"Lots of custom made spacer blocks it looks like.   I grabbed this higher res image from Jalopnik and added some arrows to point out the custom fab parts. http://i.imgur.com/WGJTDI5.jpg  There are a few pieces that can't be seen from this angle too like the rear subframe spacers and trailing arm spacers. There is probably a good bit of custom exhaust work done too in order to drop it down.  Basically everywhere the drivetrain bolts on to the body, you put in a spacer."
battlewagon,2mpped,injulen,3,Wed Nov 19 17:10:45 2014 UTC,"Nice job.   Noting the big arrow on the right, which spaces the bottom of the strut (to make room for the tire under the spring perch) - there is also going to be a spacer on top of the strut as well."
battlewagon,2mpped,baccaruda66,2,Wed Nov 19 18:07:41 2014 UTC,Yeah there are definitely many things that need to be done that can't easily be pointed out in that photo.

battlewagon,2mpped,kstorm88,1 point,Wed Nov 19 03:16:52 2014 UTC,"What sort of wheels?? Also, how do you drop your cross member?"
battlewagon,2mpped,Maschinenbau,1 point,Wed Nov 19 03:34:02 2014 UTC,"You add a spacer between the subframe and the chassis. Basically like a body lift on a truck. The engine/trans/subframe assembly is all attached by just a few bolts. You stick a spacer in between to lift the body higher. If you lift this high without dropping the subframe, you'll overextend the CV joints."
battlewagon,2mpped,kstorm88,1 point,Wed Nov 19 03:59:25 2014 UTC,"Usually you drop the cross member to correct driveline angles associated with the lift. It's done by placing blocks between the body and the cross member. Unfortunately to do this, it takes a lot of work. Many things need to be repositioned and extended. I was able to drop the front cross member of my 86 1/2"" without having to lengthen my steering shaft or anything else.  What you see here is not a ""drivable"" car, this is probably only run like this in the winter or offroading. I would not drive that down the highway any significant distance. After lifting my car, I don't do much highway driving anymore. Things just wear out faster, and tires wear much faster and unevenly due to camber. I'm not as concerned with hwy driving in the winter when the roads are covered in snow. My car is only really used for plowing my driveway, and a few friends, and hunting."
battlewagon,2mpped,NeilOMalley,2,Wed Nov 19 04:21:15 2014 UTC,"What you say about not being drivable is not really true.  I used to daily my lifted wagon for about 2.5 years.  Still drive it all the time with a 6"" lift.  No weird tire wear and no other major mechanical issues beyond off road related stuff.  Tracks perfectly down the highway.  If it's done right you won't have issues."
battlewagon,2mpped,kstorm88,1 point,Wed Nov 19 05:31:05 2014 UTC,"In full disclosure, my gl was pretty loose up front to start with. I did a custom lift of 2,5 up front and 2.25"" in the rear. I did correct for camber in the front but it could have been a bit more. Starting with a loose rack and all just amplified it after the lift. The car structurally is on its last legs and possibly it's final year on the road until the wheels fall off (literally) damn that MN salt, and it sure didn't help rotting in a field for 4 years before I bought it."
battlewagon,2mpped,kstorm88,1 point,Wed Nov 19 12:58:31 2014 UTC,"Hm.. Well so far I have like I said, 06 Fozzy suspension and I plan on getting a 1"" strut spacer along with bigger tires. I was thinking just General Grabber AT2s.. Do you think I would have to do any of this crazy stuff if I put that 1"" strut spacer on? This is my daily driver we're talking about"
battlewagon,2mpped,injulen,1 point,Wed Nov 19 04:42:35 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure, I'm not proficient in the lifting of  newer subarus, I just know my old gl. Althought, you said it was a legacy, is it not an outback? The outback and legacy had different mounts I believe for 5he rear diff and stuff, so you may want to look into that after swapping in the forester suspension."

battlewagon,2mpped,Lhabia,1 point,Wed Nov 19 04:58:26 2014 UTC,"If you exceed 2"" of lift without dropping the differentials then your CV axles will wear out faster. Your 06 fozzy suspension lifts it what, 1.5""? or is it a full 2""? Adding 1"" spacers is going to put you beyond 2"" and likely cause premature failure of the cv axles."

My front fender from the ground measures 28 inches and my rear one measures 26 and 3/4s.. Maybe even 25 and 3/4s. I think I just have a saggy butt so I'll probably buy the 1 inch spacers just for the rear. I just ordered my AT2s. They should give me another 1.5 inch lift. So stoked"
battlewagon,2mpped,Rodeeo,3,Thu Nov 20 06:08:07 2014 UTC,"The bottom of those struts look like they have extended the bracket that connects to the hub, though I'm going by Impreza suspension design."
battlewagon,2mpped,baccaruda66,3,Wed Nov 19 03:34:16 2014 UTC,"Yeah, definitely. That's the biggest piece OP I think is overlooking to get the tires to fit under the spring perches. The whole hub was dropped away from the lower strut mount with that bracket and the added third bolt."

Make that shit sparkly.   -plastidip is a great, cheap way to add a little bit of flair to your ride. In addition to the rims, play around with two-tone. The best part is, if you fuck it up or it looks like shit, you can undo it fairly easily.   -Fart cans are for ricers, but a muffler that isn't too loud (think flowmaster 50 series) can sound great, especially on cars where the engine itself doesn't make too much noise.   Other than that, listen to UncleAugie's advice on maintenance. You can have the flyest car in town, but if it doesn't run it's not worth anything.   p.s. - Look at mods that are commonly done to light duty trucks like Tacomas and Rangers. Most of them are pretty practical, and if done right can look (and work) good on early Outbacks like yours."

battlewagon,2mm87m,iceburgh29,1 point,Tue Nov 18 06:56:20 2014 UTC,"I guess I have the 50 from 50' going for me.   The rear arches, hatch, and hood are all rusted. As are the undersides of all the doors. As a first car, the people I met through it more than make up for the rust. It gets me from A to B and that's the most important bit.   I heard naval jelly will help stop some of the rust? I might (probably won't) pack the lip of my fenders with it in the coming weeks.   I'll be honest, doing the POR-15 will be interesting to see. If you do, please post up. Just gotta find a good body line to spray under. Lol.   One other thing if your doors aren't already on their way out, pop those silly flaps out of there. Mine were bunged up with filth and as a result im guessing the water sat in there and ate them from the inside out."
battlewagon,2mm87m,whb25,2,Tue Nov 18 13:17:00 2014 UTC,Is it typical for cars to rust out like this or was this generation especially bad? I had a 2001 Protege MP3 and sold it in 2009 but it was a California car so of course rust is a non issue. I live in Oregon now but they don't use salt here in the snowy spots .....
battlewagon,2mm87m,Ophites,2,Tue Nov 18 19:54:43 2014 UTC,I think its that the salt manages to get in between the seams of the metal and rusts inside out.   I know its said that the paint on Mazda's is known to be quite thin. Maybe that leads to the rust too?  I think the humidity doesn't help when the salt is down too. My friend lived in CO and rust was a non-issue. I guess a wise thing would be to rinse the underside of the car off often... But you might not have that issue (jealous)
battlewagon,2mm87m,Ophites,1 point,Tue Nov 18 20:46:25 2014 UTC,"Rinsing mine just sped up the process, I think it allowed the salt to get into the surface deeper because it was dissolved in the water :/"
battlewagon,2mm87m,iceburgh29,1 point,Tue Nov 18 23:58:05 2014 UTC,"Oh! I uhh, I guess that was wrong... I just let it rust. I heard parking in a warm garage will speed it up as the snow will melt so your comment makes sense. I guess just liberally applying undercoating before it gets bad is the best course of action..."
battlewagon,2mm87m,Ophites,2,Wed Nov 19 00:40:45 2014 UTC,The color of paint has a lot to do with it.  Some P5's I see locally have ZERO RUST.  I live in the salt zone.  Other P5's like my old one rusted right the fuck out.  The silver ones are bad from what I hear/have experienced.  Apparently some have more coats of paint or something.
battlewagon,2mm87m,iceburgh29,1 point,Tue Nov 18 23:56:45 2014 UTC,"The bright blue ones aren't too bad, same with yellow. I think in terms of severity it goes:  Silver (worst, also worse for frame rusting from what I've seen)  Red (seen some pretty gnarly rusting around the emblems)  Midnight Blue  White/Black (I've only seen one black one, and my white one is the only one I've seen in my city)  Yellow (it varies, I've seen about a dozen.  2 of them were baaaad. The others were mint.)  Laser Blue"
battlewagon,2mm87m,misfire25,1 point,Wed Nov 19 09:11:52 2014 UTC,Ah I see.  The ones in good condition around here are the Midnight Blue ad Yellows.  Mine was a silver.

battlewagon,2me4xa,Bassracerx,2,Sat Nov 15 21:31:40 2014 UTC,Do you think 225 70 16s. Would fit?
battlewagon,2me4xa,Bassracerx,2,Sun Nov 16 04:11:27 2014 UTC,Hmm..... That's only 10 more millimeters of width. I'm not certain on that but i wouldn't see why they wouldn't. I'm sure the beads would seat just fine. They can stretch the ever living hell out of tires on rims they shouldn't be able to and they hold. I can't imagine that 10 more millimeters would cause any problems.
battlewagon,2me4xa,Rilnac,1 point,Sun Nov 16 04:19:08 2014 UTC,I know they will fit in the wheels i was worrried about rubbing
battlewagon,2me4xa,ryanthegreat1,1 point,Sun Nov 16 04:48:56 2014 UTC,I have no idea. They are probably going to rub if you don't have either a lift or wheel spacers.
battlewagon,2me4xa,ryanthegreat1,1 point,Sun Nov 16 04:53:22 2014 UTC,"Since the 70 is a ratio of the width to height, adding extra width at the same ratio actually increases height as well. You should use a tire calculator to get a proper comparison (http://www.tacomaworld.com/forum/tirecalc.php?tires=215-70r16-225-70r16). Personally I have an 01 Foz and I find my Grabber AT2s @ 215 65r16 are really pushing it. Both in height and width."

battlewagon,2maoxv,ryanthegreat1,5,Fri Nov 14 19:27:40 2014 UTC,Assuming the wheels were put back on with the locking nuts to send the car out the door.  A lot of dealerships have the correct keys for the nuts. They are more universal than people think.

battlewagon,2maoxv,Cyfun06,5,Sat Nov 15 16:21:48 2014 UTC,If they had it up in the air it can be fairly easy to see the inner pad wear without removing a wheel. They may very well be 10-15% left. But $300 per corner had better include new rotors and loaded calipers.
battlewagon,2maoxv,Rilnac,2,Fri Nov 14 18:55:09 2014 UTC,"Yes, it's possible for them to have checked, but I highly doubt they did.  If they're trying to charge you $1200 for a $50 brake job, they probably didn't even check your pads to begin with.  If your pads were getting low, you'd probably hear the wear indicators squealing.  But it'd be easy enough to find out: just pop off a wheel and look.  Also, isn't a tranny flush incredibly easy to do yourself too?"
battlewagon,2maoxv,chrisindub,1 point,Fri Nov 14 20:36:37 2014 UTC,"I did one over the summer, it is mostly easy, it is way messier than an oil change and outputs about double the volume. So it is more that it's a hassle than difficult."

battlewagon,2maoxv,Pizza_The_Hutt,5,Sat Nov 15 15:45:27 2014 UTC,The stealership.... LOL  You know the answer to this question
battlewagon,2maoxv,Rilnac,1 point,Fri Nov 14 17:58:08 2014 UTC,"I agree with the other posters, for that much it better include new rotors at a minimum. Pads range in price from $15/corner to about $40 for ultra fancy stuff. I usually compare on something like http://www.rockauto.com/catalog/catalog.php since you can see lots of different suppliers for the same part.  Edit: correction, holy crap, the cheapest shitty pads are as cheap as $3/corner. But I would recommend looking at stuff under the 'daily driver' category as a minimum. The 'economy' stuff just isn't worth it, especially if you want your car to stop."

battlewagon,2m5s1p,teamwrk,2,Fri Nov 14 05:31:36 2014 UTC,"I like the taller gearing, the rt4wd has REALLY short gears to start with.  Very very light rubbing at full lock in the front on the plastic inner fender on the front side of the tire. Does not make contact with any hard parts. I think a small lift in the front to level out the car will eliminate all the rubbing.  Not sure how down on power the extra rotating mass makes the car feel because I bought it running on 2 cylinders. It now has a very fresh and tight d16a6 (stock) in it that pulls it around just fine on the big tires. It is not a rocket but also not the slowest thing on the road."

battlewagon,2m5s1p,brahbarian,1 point,Thu Nov 13 14:39:54 2014 UTC,"If you didn't already know, look into CB Accord suspension. With some minor modifications (grind upright, swap tophats) you'll get them mounted up with no rubbing. Use a hockey puck or spacer to get the full 2"", I got close to 1.5"" stock. I also used Odyssey springs for added stiffness to keep the front end off the ground."
battlewagon,2m5s1p,Viridion,1 point,Thu Nov 13 21:09:59 2014 UTC,"Yes I did try the Accord struts up front. Did not fit very well with the larger diameter springs. At right height it was okay but with 1"" of droop the knuckle and spring were binding really hard even with the tabs cut off. Going with some strut spacers to really dial in the amount of lift. 1.75"" was the max amount of lift I could get with spacers before the spring started to touch the knuckle at full droop.   Might look into EG struts as mentioned by another redditor to see if those would net me the 1.75"" of lift + travel without the need for spacers. The other option is first gen CRV struts but those are 2.25"" longer at the strut so probably 3-4"" of lift. But that also requires Intergra type r lower control arms in the rear."

Full engine refresh and drive lines and seals and bearing and brakes and on and on and on. Going to be my daily so it needs to be 100% reliable.  Want a lift to level out the front and give that last little bit of clearance needed at full lock.  Wheels are the OEM RT wheels fresh from powder coat. Have the center caps just need to get them painted with the color matched spray paint.  Oh and that roof rack I pulled off an xterra that needs to be shortened up and installed.

battlewagon,2m4ek1,jet_silver,1 point,Fri Nov 14 02:20:00 2014 UTC,"Why was it going to cost you 5k? I did the clutch, rear main seal, oil separator plate gasket, and rear cam cover o-ring for under $300. Granted I pulled the engine myself."

battlewagon,2m1v77,cyclic_rival,7,Wed Nov 12 06:38:26 2014 UTC,This is my buddies Toyota Corona Battlewagon.  It is the Toyota Corona body on a Chevy Luv frame using a Nissan transfer case.  Thought you all might like it.
battlewagon,2m1v77,NeilOMalley,5,Wed Nov 12 06:39:30 2014 UTC,I dig all these solid axle swapped (frame too) wagons.  Gives me hope for mine and my BRAT.
battlewagon,2m1v77,KiboshWasabi,1 point,Wed Nov 12 07:12:27 2014 UTC,Its very cool. Maybe I'm a purist but I think it stopped being a corona as soon as it landed on a luv frame. Now its a chevy luv(Isuzu frame by the way) with a toyota wagon body.
battlewagon,2m1v77,NeilOMalley,4,Wed Nov 12 07:18:51 2014 UTC,Using that logic would my wagon no longer be a Subaru after the lift and some other parts being swapped?  Where do you draw the line?
battlewagon,2m1v77,KiboshWasabi,7,Wed Nov 12 07:44:51 2014 UTC,"Is your unibody wagon laying on a GM frame? The line is primarily the frame thing. The frame IS the vehicle. Its not any different than building a space frame for a shell body, it becomes too specialized.  You can lift a Justy, stuff an LS1 in it and its still a Justy. If you slap it on a k5 frame though it stops being a Subaru, its cool but its not a Subaru anymore, its a K5 with a Justy shell. Weird analogy I know but thats how I roll."
battlewagon,2m1v77,NeilOMalley,2,Wed Nov 12 07:57:37 2014 UTC,I see what you mean and it makes sense.  I just consider it to be whatever the body is because a lot of those swapped rod have had the frame modified so it's not even really a stock frame anymore.
battlewagon,2m1v77,adudeguyman,2,Wed Nov 12 15:09:45 2014 UTC,"When you see it, do you see a wagon or a truck?"
battlewagon,2m1v77,KiboshWasabi,-2,Wed Nov 12 14:36:59 2014 UTC,"Well I'm not retarded so I can identify a wagon when I see one. Thats not the point, its not really an off road Corona anymore. Its a truck with a shell on it. Its closer to being a monster truck than it is to being a battlewagon, imo."
battlewagon,2m1v77,adudeguyman,6,Wed Nov 12 14:39:57 2014 UTC,"Congratulations on not being retarded.  Of course when you see it, you can't help but know that it is on a truck frame.  However, the body is still in the shape of a Corona.  I certainly wouldn't call it a monster truck."
battlewagon,2m1v77,Cyfun06,4,Wed Nov 12 14:44:38 2014 UTC,"Guy, guys...  Can we agree that it's simply a monster wagon? :D"
battlewagon,2m1v77,KiboshWasabi,1 point,Wed Nov 12 15:46:54 2014 UTC,"For me its the same difference as slapping a fiberglass truck shell onto a steel space frame and calling it big foot. Would it be any less of a Luv pickup with some other body shell on it? Let's say that truck rolls and you swap the body for a Cressida, is it then a Cressida? When did it cease being a Luv? Its all personal preference in the long run but for me I don't think you can ignore the foundation of the vehicle in favor of the shell on top."

battlewagon,2lxrl0,Cyfun06,2,Tue Nov 11 11:31:32 2014 UTC,"Need a new front muffler hangar, as well as getting this pipe welded back up. Though I think this is going to require a catback replacement, not sure what everything above the break here looks like yet. If it's salvageable I'm going to have a shop weld it back up, if it's going to require a catback I'm just going to wire up the midpipe for now and replace it myself when I have the money."
battlewagon,2lxrl0,D_Robb,2,Tue Nov 11 09:13:33 2014 UTC,"It looks like a resonator, to be honest. Too narrow for a muffler and too long/not much like a cat (for that size engine). You don't need it to pass most state inspections, resonators just make the exhaust sound more domesticated. You could replace it with just a pipe, but you might not like how it sounds."
battlewagon,2lxrl0,chrwei,1 point,Tue Nov 11 10:31:24 2014 UTC,"Nah, it's definitely a muffler. I ordered it and installed it myself. It's a Magnaflow, just their smallest round can."
battlewagon,2lxrl0,Cyfun06,1 point,Tue Nov 11 21:22:02 2014 UTC,"a mufler shop should not only be able to fix it, but also craft a custom catback for about what you'd pay for a kit, if not less.  the kits are nice because just about anyone can bolt them up in their driveway, so if you're going to have a shop do it anyway, just have them make you one.  also, this is what skid plates are for."
battlewagon,2lxrl0,Churchless,5,Tue Nov 11 14:46:42 2014 UTC,"Snow shouldn't just rip off your muffler.  I'm guessing the piping was already rusted and weak. A lift won't help worn out exhaust system much.  If your muffler itself is still intact, you can probably get away with just replacing the broken section.  If it's not too rusty, just have it sleeved and welded."
battlewagon,2lw73e,Rilnac,5,Mon Nov 10 20:45:15 2014 UTC,"The ride is incredibly firm now, not quite to the point of being uncomfortable but you definitely feel the road more. There is virtually no body roll on sharp turns which is lovely. Our half-assed alignment is actually an improvement from before which is a bit terrifying. Most importantly the horrible grinding I've listened to since my road trip is finally gone."
battlewagon,2lw73e,THEMCV,3,Mon Nov 10 20:50:47 2014 UTC,"Nice! They look great! If I ever get enough money to replace my suspension, I'm going to go with new KYB GR2s with regular sized King Springs since I can't go more than my lift already. :p"
battlewagon,2lw73e,THEMCV,2,Mon Nov 10 21:54:42 2014 UTC,"In theory the raised kings shouldn't have an adverse affect on your other parts. Since the travel limits on the strut remain the same, it is just the 'at rest' position you are pushing out. Personally, I'm going to probably let this settle for the winter and investigate spacers in the springtime."
battlewagon,2lw73e,THEMCV,1 point,Mon Nov 10 22:01:11 2014 UTC,"I'm already at my 2"" limit, so if I were to go over that any I'd have to drop everything. I'm going to wait for the 4"" lift before I do any dropping, but that's going to be a while.  Awesome Forester again. Can't wait to see it in action. :)"

battlewagon,2lw73e,KiboshWasabi,3,Mon Nov 10 22:43:59 2014 UTC,"FYI, the extra twist in the spring makes it a little softer. You can think of springs as pretty much a long rod, coiled up. It's easier to bend a long rod than a short one, and the more coils the longer it is. Similarly, cut springs are softer."
battlewagon,2lw73e,Bassracerx,3,Tue Nov 11 02:47:35 2014 UTC,"Yup, makes perfect sense. I can't imagine what kind of jack-hammering I would be subjected to with one fewer coil."
battlewagon,2lw73e,Bassracerx,1 point,Tue Nov 11 02:50:12 2014 UTC,"When in doubt add more cheater bars, if its stiff enough 18 feet of cheater bar will break anything loose, including welds :]. What size tires are on there now and what to what size will you be changing? Is the new stiffness annoying with speed bumps and the like?"
battlewagon,2lw73e,Bassracerx,3,Mon Nov 10 21:26:11 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I was perfectly fine with just snapping the bolts and hammering them out, all my junkyard runs have netted me enough spare bolts. Fortunately it didn't come to that.  I'm currently running fairly worn down Grabber AT2s 215_65r16, with winter coming I'll need to swap to my xice3 215/60R17 soon (the grabbers are far too stiff for ice). Come spring I'll likely get some more grabbers and retire the two with most tread to be spares. I can't really fit anything bigger....  while the lift adds more room in the wheel well, it doesn't change the position of the spring seat or the proximity of the sidewall to the strut itself, so I am pretty much at max size as is.  I've yet to take it over any speed bumps, they may prove a bit unpleasant as I am not a fan of braking...."
battlewagon,2lw73e,musubk,1 point,Mon Nov 10 22:08:51 2014 UTC,Really? Theres gotta be a way to run larger tires. Maybe some steelies of the proper offset and some spacers. I couldn't stand to run so much gap even in a dirt devil.
battlewagon,2luxnz,THEMCV,6,Mon Nov 10 14:05:31 2014 UTC,I think it looks perfect that way.
battlewagon,2luxnz,Cwazywazy14,3,Mon Nov 10 14:58:32 2014 UTC,"Thanks. :) I do love the look now that the front is lower than the rear, but I did like how giant it was too. :p"
battlewagon,2luxnz,PotatoCamera,4,Mon Nov 10 17:08:11 2014 UTC,"Honestly, It looks great! not to outrageous,but you definitely gain clearance. Unless you are shooting for a full off road rig."

battlewagon,2luxnz,Evoraist,4,Mon Nov 10 17:09:01 2014 UTC,"It still looks awesome, and makes me want to go a bit higher. I will say though I did not expect it to be that noticeable.   This was before settling. http://i.imgur.com/JdonaR1.jpg  After http://i.imgur.com/JcAG4vv.jpg  Do you know why it compressed that much? It looks like (and I am completely guessing) about a 1.5"" drop maybe less but noticeable. Still looks way better than my 1"" lift.   After our last discussion I think I am with you on wanting the 4"". But my question though on that is would I really gain ground clearance if I have to drop the sub-frame and engine like you said?   Of course if I start going to high I would then need another daily since I  have tried to keep a daily but tend to just want to do things with them. Of course I would need a bigger garage or driveway also. Being not rich is so unfair./s"
battlewagon,2luxnz,reallifedog,2,Mon Nov 10 19:36:58 2014 UTC,"The springs were being pulled down/had no force on them for many hours (10am-1:30am), so they needed to settle again when the car got lowered back down.  Check out this Baja thread. He's got the 4"" lift. With a 4"" lift, we should be able to fit 235/70/16s like him with some trimming. The main reason for lifts (especially bigger ones) is to fit bigger tires.  You could always find a car you hate and has no community behind it. :p"
battlewagon,2luxnz,kevinpdx,0,Mon Nov 10 21:49:31 2014 UTC,"Ah okay. That helps a bit more to understand.  As for a car I hate, it would be nice to have a little car that gets amazing MPG but at the same time I like my AWD getting me anywhere I need to go. That and driving a car you hate will only end up causing you to drive your other cars more which goes against the intended purpose. If cars were not so fun I would not have to worry about this. Of course that can be said about a lot of things. Mainly all I know now is that I need to make more money to support my addiction. I started on this one due to wanting to be able to get more places to find fossils. Now I just want to find reasons to get it off road. I am like ""Oh this is where we park and we walk to there to find some stuff? What if we just drive through that creek and through that field instead?"". Yep, I caught the lifted/off road bug. It is just as costly as the go fast bug. On the bright side my wife is understanding. :)"

battlewagon,2luxnz,sky4,3,Mon Nov 10 22:05:03 2014 UTC,"I think it looks good. The difference between a 2"" and 4"" lift as far as work goes is substantial.

Im definitely not saying its impossible or a bad idea but the scope of the work bares mentioning."
battlewagon,2luxnz,KiboshWasabi,3,Mon Nov 10 15:44:09 2014 UTC,"Thanks. :) You're definitely right. If it took me this long for the 2"", I can't imagine how long it would take to drop everything. It'd be doable, but not in a weekend. Maybe someday when I have the time, tools, and money. :p"

battlewagon,2lsu6v,WorldwideBrandt,2,Mon Nov 10 02:29:16 2014 UTC,Cheaper route: call around and find a shop that will only press the bearings in.   You can take everything else apart and put everything else back together.   It's a PITA but should only cost you bearing and a half hour of labor.

battlewagon,2luf2v,voomanchu,2,Mon Nov 10 08:59:23 2014 UTC,"my buddy put 215/70r15s on his Foz and netted about 1.5 lift from that. Granted in this pic there is also a 2"" spacer lift and and 1"" trailing arm drop. I believe he's just over 11"" clearance at the rear diff.  EDIT: to /u/chrwei's point on clearance, the 215/70s clear the rear springs by 3/16"". It pretty scary how close they are."
battlewagon,2luf2v,reallifedog,1 point,Mon Nov 10 15:40:38 2014 UTC,"the only way to get lift from tires is to get a bigger overall diameter, and unless you're running undersized tires now you'll quickly run into clearance issues in the wheel well and the strut itself.  it'll also throw off your speedometer and odometer."
battlewagon,2luf2v,chrwei,1 point,Mon Nov 10 15:11:39 2014 UTC,"I don't know if you'll be able to tell, but I have these on right now and they seem super small. Are AT2s any bigger than that? I haven't ever actually seen them in person."
battlewagon,2luf2v,chrwei,2,Mon Nov 10 16:34:01 2014 UTC,"AT2 is a series name, they come in a bunch of sizes.  '97 Legacy's had multiple factory options depending on trim level: 185/70R14, 195/60R15, and 205/55R16.  I'm going to take a wild guess and say these all had about the same circumference.  you can do the math below to figure that out if you like.  the Rxx is the wheel size, so for your 15"" wheels 195/60R15 would be the stock size.    the 195 is the tread width in millimeters, and the 60 is the aspect ratio, meaning the sidewall height is 60% of the tread width.  the difference in sidewall height is going to be the difference in your lift.  if your tires have smaller with or ratio, then getting the correct size will give some lift, and correct your speedometer.  you can get some lift by getting a higher aspect ratio, like 65 or 70, and a wider width.  but like I said, go too big and it will rub, and that's a major bad thing as rubbing can cause extra heat which can cause tire failure.  You can also go thinner and taller if the strut is the clearance issue and not the wheel well.  A tire shop should be able to help you figure out what will fit.  add the sidewall height times 2 and convert to inches, then add 15"" to get the tire diameter, then you'll have some idea of the clearance you need."

battlewagon,2ltagn,Evoraist,2,Mon Nov 10 00:56:36 2014 UTC,"I just made a post today of my 2"" SJR lift  I have done a lot of research into the best way to lift our cars, so I think I can help out. One important thing to note is we can only go 2"" without needing to drop subframe, engine, etc.  King Springs + New shocks are a good combination because they improve the ride of the vehicle by making it stiffer with a variable spring rate, plus new shocks are nice. The problem I found was there was no definitive ""this is how much King Springs lift"". I've heard 1"", .5"", and 1.5"". It's different for everybody and that's a problem when it comes to adding spacers. I've talked with Primitive and they highly suggested not having 1"" spacers with the springs because it's different for everybody. If it lifts 1"" in the front and 1.5"" in the rear, that's a problem because you're over your 2"" that you can handle. Now, they do make regular sized King Springs, but they're still a whole lot at ~$500 plus the price of new shocks.  Unfortunately, there's not a suspension setup that matches our Outbacks from any year of Forester. The fronts match with I think MY99 Foresters, but the rears are different.   I ordered from SJR lifts because it provided the most lift for the money. You can check out the link above, but I love the look of it. The problem is, the install is a pain if you're new to it and aren't sure about the process like I was. As mentioned in the post, I started at 10am and ended at 3:30am. Not super fun in the dark and cold. Although it took us a while, you may be able to have a shop put these in much quicker. It took a long time just figuring out the first one, then added complications like needing to drive to the store like 6 times, a CV boot needing replaced, and the cold didn't help.  Hopefully this helps. :)"
battlewagon,2ltagn,THEMCV,0,Mon Nov 10 02:46:45 2014 UTC,"Wow, thanks. This goes along with what information I am looking for. I have tried researching it but not really knowing anything about suspension I only served to confuse myself more. Which is why I just came back here and asked like I did.  I am not sure I still understand why the spacers make the difference and should not be used though. Is there something that would need to be longer/bigger to reach something else?   Out of curiosity what is involved in the drop of a sub frame and engine?  I have a garage I could do the work in but even now with the outside temps getting down to 40 degrees or so the garage gets pretty cold, plus I would need to move both my wifes new forester and my evo out and most likely have them outside all weekend while I figure out what I am doing. I have done some things with my evo but only after a lot of studying, having the walk-throughs there with me, and nothing to do with suspension. In fact I am waiting for that perfect weekend to start the timing belt, water pump, and clutch/break line replacement (stuff I have never done) as well as doing the complete fluids, and plugs. Basically a full service just to make sure it is healthy even though it does not get driven a lot.   I do not work well in cold conditions I would rather hibernate.   Sorry if anyone reading this thinks these questions are stupid. If I do not ask specifics I cannot be sure I understand. If I am not sure I understand I cannot be sure of what I know. I know I ask questions some think are stupid but it will bug me to no end if I don't."
battlewagon,2ltagn,THEMCV,2,Mon Nov 10 03:41:21 2014 UTC,"No problem. I've done a lot of research and reading into it and it definitely can get confusing, so no worries. :)  The problem with Kings + Spacers is our max height. Your 1"" spacers obviously lift 1"", but the King springs lift ~1"", not a solid 1"". How much they lift varies from car to car, and often the fronts and the rears will lift a different amount like 1"" up front and 1.5"" in the rear. Going over that 2"" is going to cause you problems that aren't going to be fun. Going over 2"" is forcing the angles for everything past what it can really continuously handle. That's why 4"" lifts and up require you to drop everything down (subframe, engine, etc).  With the drop, I'm really not sure as I haven't done too much looking into it. I know you need an engine cradle to lower it, a longer radiator hose, and other things, but I couldn't tell you any details on it.  I feel you on the cold conditions. Working until 3:30am in the cold was not something I enjoyed at all. We had a fire going and warmed up occasionally, but it still was not fun.  And really, don't worry! These are good questions to ask. I asked the same exact questions in the past. :) You're right, if you don't ask you won't know the answer. :)"
battlewagon,2ltagn,THEMCV,0,Mon Nov 10 03:55:22 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I know some people get upset though if you ask a lot of stuff especially if they think since you are interested in cars you should know already. Not saying I have seen that on this sub, but have seen it on reddit and other parts of the web so I kind of expect someone is going to jump all over me about asking something.  Having said that. Is there anyway you can force the springs to stay at or below the 1""?   Maybe someday I can go a bit more (would definitely need a shop for that), like at least a total of 3"" lift. But if I were going to spend that much I might as well do a 4"". This is sort of like the go fast bug with my evo. Now it sucks more because I have two cars I want to do things too. Well it does not suck because cars and cool stuff, just money the cars cost. I need a job that pays way more than I get paid now. Or to win the lottery that I never play."
battlewagon,2ltagn,THEMCV,2,Mon Nov 10 04:04:38 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I hate about a lot of online communities. We've tried to make sure that doesn't happen here. :)  Not that I know of. I've talked with Primitive and they suggested me a (1/2"" and 3/4"" I think) spacer if I was wanting additional lift besides the King springs.  I feel you. SJR makes a 4"" and 6"" lift kit for our cars. The problem with ours is we can't fit super big tires. :("
battlewagon,2ltagn,THEMCV,0,Mon Nov 10 04:10:50 2014 UTC,"Oh, I was not aware of the small spacers. When I found out about the 1"" spacers they were the only thing I looked for. Now I wonder if there is a way I could perfectly slim mine down (likely not but certainly crossing my mind).  I guess I could eBay them and put that toward a smaller spacer, but then I would need to know how much, unless .25"" would not be too drastic. This is where I have problems with suspension. There are a lot of variables. It is nothing like tossing a high-flow fuel pump or larger intercool on or other bolt on stuff. This actually takes some understanding of other things I never thought to consider before.   I also just ordered my off road bar (should be here this week I think) so there was that cost I have to consider as well. Plus I would like to get some light bars like you have because cool and late night on rural roads can be dark and wild animals hitting your car sucks."

The AWD system is a newer evolution of Suzuki's FWD system, so you can ""lock"" it into ""AWD"" mode, but it's still pretty much a front-driver. The snow and rain performance is alright.  I suppose one can argue it's like a Subaru being biased FWD with the automatic, but you can change the bias by downshifting. With Suzuki, 50/50 is the best it will do. It can't really get too good low and unlike Subaru, you can't get really good AWD performance above 100km/60mph"

The anti-roll bars should be noticeable if they are larger diameter than your OE sway bars- I know when I swapped my stock ones for some off an RS it was a noticeable change. You may notice the slightly wider stance, bit probably not unless you're cornering hard and on stiffer suspension.  If you want stiffer suspension you can get springs and/or struts. I usually recommend struts because they may be worth replacing near that age anyway. If they make adjustable struts, they're worth the extra money. I love my KYB AGXs.  If your car suffers from saggy butt syndrome (SBS) now, it will probably do so post loft. You can overcome that with some strut tower spacers (typically HDPE or aluminum)."

battlewagon,2lc2ey,pdxrover,1 point,Thu Nov 6 21:53:23 2014 UTC,"Wow, thanks man! Good to know a lift isn't absolutely necessary to fit bulkier tires"
battlewagon,2lc2ey,Cyfun06,1 point,Fri Nov 7 01:14:51 2014 UTC,"Honestly, the first and easiest step is to remove the stock bumpers and any low-hanging trim.  This will improve your ground clearance, along with your approach and departure angles.  After you get them off, you can look into buying or making some tube bumpers.  There aren't many CR-V fans around here, but you should be able to dig around on google to find out the largest diameter tire you can fit without needing a suspension or body lift.  Your stock tire size is 205/70R15, so a 215/75R15 is 1.5 inches larger in diameter and would probably fit.  If so, this will give you 3/4 inch of extra clearance.  If you're lucky, you can fit some 235/75R15s, which are a very common small truck tire and can be often had for around $80 each (Walmart has some Goodyear Wrangers with an aggressive tread pattern for about that much). Those are about 2.5 inches taller in diameter, so they'd give you a bit over an inch more in clearance.  However, for driving on sand, you want the widest tire you can fit.  A 235 is a little over an inch wider than a 205, so that might be enough.  Also, you can improve your traction in sand by letting air out of your tires.  Of course then the problem becomes airing them back up for the drive home.  So a small air compressor might be a worthy investment.  Don't get the tiny fuckers that run on your cig lighter socket, as they will take half an hour to reinflate all four tires.  Look for a regular small compressor with a tank, and a power inverter of appropriate wattage to go along with it.  Other than that, some skid plates might be in order, but it doesn't sound like you'll be doing enough aggressive offroading to necessitate it.  And you don't need a lift unless your tires start rubbing."
battlewagon,2lc2ey,tpm319,1 point,Wed Nov 5 07:56:20 2014 UTC,"Tires will definitely be my first move, thanks for the advice. And I've got more than enough sheet metal to make a skid plate for at least my front diff."

battlewagon,2lbki4,Im_Done_Thats_It,1 point,Wed Nov 5 01:34:48 2014 UTC,I'm leaning toward the Dunlop Grandtrek SJ6 in a 225/65-17  I'd run a higher pressure during daily driving and lower when offroad - I mounted an air compressor in my engine bay so its convenient for me to tinker with tire pressure - so I'm not too worried about the harder compound when off-road (but a good point).

battlewagon,2lbki4,NeilOMalley,3,Wed Nov 5 04:19:46 2014 UTC,"[USA] Title 49 off NHTSA's vehicle regulation code classifies the Outback (and Forester) as light trucks.  This, although Subaru denies it, is to easily satisfy CAFE regulations of something like 22 mpg versus passenger car manufacturer averages of 27.  Sorry, should have been 235/75R17. Small for a pick up truck,but not a Jeep or something like that.  Whatever the case, it would be nice for SOA to push for the car to more completely embrace the light truck classification so customers have a wide selection of tires (among other things). :-)"
battlewagon,2lbki4,Evoraist,3,Wed Nov 5 05:00:37 2014 UTC,"I don't think we will ever see Subaru bother to cater to the .1% of people who ""off road"" their cars.

There are going to be issues with your under tray needing longer support bolts and being dropped down into the second tab on the sides if you're tray is like ours.    Get on Legacygt.com for more questions...we have several guys to go the OB --> LGT route.
battlewagon,2l901u,soltym,3,Tue Nov 4 13:41:37 2014 UTC,"Here is a guy who put LGT springs and shocks on a 4th gen Outback  Now, whether the LGT suspension is the same as for the rest of the Legacy range, I'm not sure.   There are also lift kits like this available.   Your could probably also go to a part store and let them look up the different dimensions of the shocks.   I think it's unlikely that they won't fit at all, but the outback springs might be a bit stiffer as well as longer, plus the ratio between front and rear shock/spring length might not be the same. (I made a 1991 legacy very low in the rear by putting 98 imreza suspension on it. looked a bit weird but the suspension worked great)."
battlewagon,2l901u,bragis,2,Tue Nov 4 13:26:59 2014 UTC,Yes and remember to get an alignment done after the swap.
battlewagon,2l901u,pdxrover,2,Tue Nov 4 17:32:23 2014 UTC,"It will work, but there are a lot of little differences between the OB and standard Legacy. The 05-09 Outback's engine is 1"" lower than the Legacy, as well as spacers around some of the x-members, and supports. The purpose of these is to offset the increased center of gravity height. Since a Legacy does not have these: You're Legacy will handle worse than an Outback when you raise it to Outback height.   Personal opinion: I don't think it will be a large enough difference to put you in any real danger, and you may not even notice it. I say go for it!"

I did not have the time for the work it needed, but it started, went forward and backward, and stopped on command even then. The lady I gave her to had a mechanic friend and he fixed her. She now has 350k mi (560k km) and he hasn't done the engine yet but he replaced the clutch and said there was still 1.5 mm on it.   I cross my heart, even though I like my present car, if I could have a new '93 2.2l MT wagon AWD, I would buy it in a heartbeat. That is the most awesome car, I had a hell of a lot of fun with it. It hauled bathtubs, engine blocks, lambs, dogs, 1500 lb of pavers, two weeks' worth of supplies to J-Tree, and yet (not at the same time) would do an honest and sustained 120 mph from Fresno to Tulare on CA-99.

battlewagon,2l82i3,THEMCV,6,Tue Nov 4 03:23:53 2014 UTC,"Surprisingly, a stock wagon does exceptionally well.  If you just want to beat on your $600 toy, the only thing I would recommend is a front skid plate.  Other than that, beat the shit out of it and replace stuff as you break it.  Just don't get it airborne.  The rear struts don't like coming back to earth and will bend.  I know this from experience.   If you want to dump $$$ in to it, then we have a ton of options."

You're gonna need to hammer a few bits out to accommodate larger tires. You may also need to trim or roller your fenders. Also consider the offset of your wheels.  This is the calculator I used for initial estimates.  The problem I ran into was clearance behind the front wheels at or near full lock. With much steering g angle, the tires would run the back of the fro t fenders.  If you lift enough, you'll eventually need adjustable trailing arms too, or at least longer brackets."

I've also heard that the whole car weighs in fairly heavy. Skip the steelies, the stock aluminum rims are plenty strong, light, and free. I've hit plenty of potholes and accidentally jumped my car once, holding up just fine. Paint em black if you want. For a cheap lift, best bet is 1'' spacers. Although I would suggest new springs and struts instead, most cars that age are sagging, so just new suspension will restore some lost height. All the work trucks at my job use ECCO brand led lights. fairly cheap, very sturdy, and uncomfortably bright. Plus they survive farm conditions, which are probably harsher than any off roading you may do on the weekend. Also, above all else, take it slow, and do it a little at a time. After dropping $1500 to lift my car and put new tires on, my radiator blew up, and now all my disposable cash is out the door."

battlewagon,2l6t81,elislider,1 point,Mon Nov 3 20:46:51 2014 UTC,Just to add to this. I have a Jetta sedan and put the wagon springs on my car and got some good lift because of not having the heavier rear end of the wagon.

battlewagon,2l6t81,slotard,1 point,Mon Nov 3 22:27:44 2014 UTC,"Your best bet would probably be to swap struts and springs from an outback sedan over to your legacy.  That will give you some lift.

battlewagon,2l0tnd,throwaway_battlewago,12,Sun Nov 2 00:13:48 2014 UTC,"Technically, the ""wagon"" in ""battlewagon"" doesn't literally have to mean ""station wagon.""  By the original definition, it's simply an armored vehicle that you could drive into battle.  For example, there are plenty of old Subaru sedans, coupes, and BRATs that are considered battlewagons because they're lifted and have tube bumpers.  However, my problem with Jeeps and the other ""small SUVs"" on here is that they were designed from the factory to be driven offroad, and easily modified.  They get all the fancy shit like locking diffs and extremely low gearing that allows them to crawl and to run on 35"" tires.  For me, the biggest defining factors of a BW are:   if the vehicle's factory ground clearance was comparable with that of your typical car it has independent suspension front and rear (exceptions can be made for shit like AMC Eagles cause they're just plain cool as fuck) it's so ugly that you don't care if you beat it up a little it was done on a pretty tight budget   But like OP said, what it boils down to is that people come to /r/battlewagon to see a bunch of cars being redneck engineered into offroad machines, going off of jumps, fording rivers, and best of all: pulling out stuck Jeeps with a motherfuckin $500 Subaru. :D"
battlewagon,2l0tnd,Cyfun06,4,Sun Nov 2 04:11:10 2014 UTC,"Ahem...or a tercel...or a stanza...or a country squire...etc etc etc.  This isnt r/subaru...though it sure seams like it occasionally.  And the thing is...a battle wagon doesnt need independent suspension front and rear. I can guarantee mine has seen more shit and been abused, used, chewed up and spat out of hell more times than most, and its got a solid axle out back."

I mean these are cheap vehicles that you use to battle the elements and the road, battle damage is almost a necessity to be a battle wagon, along with on the fly fixes, homegrown beefed up this and that to better survive the harsh realities of life.   If you have a pretty car with extra lights and a thule rack with an aftermarket skidplate...thats nice and all, but would you be mad or sad if you got rear ended by a drunk and your car got flipped over? Yes, you would. You might even total it out and move on with another vehicle.   Well thats not a battle wagon. A battle wagon gets flipped back on its wheels, started up in a cloud of smoke, and gets driven home to have the rear axle swapped out, a new mirror, and some reinforcement plates welded into the new rear bumper. It is shaped by its environment and every dent, scrape, and rust hole is part of its own personality.   To put it simply, a battlewagon doesnt get totaled.

I was simply pointing out that there are plenty of battlewagons that aren't wagons. And I was really hesitant to get a Subaru bw in the beginning because I didn't wanna be just like everyone else, but it's hard to argue with the fact that they're fucking everywhere, and cheap and reliable.  And also as I said, independent suspension isn't mandatory, but it is something that tends to make us unique as it completely fucks articulation and the ability to change gearing or use a difflock.  But my Trans Am has a solid axle, and I've offroaded that more than anything."
battlewagon,2l0tnd,Cyfun06,3,Sun Nov 2 17:46:08 2014 UTC,"In my experiences with toyota pickups...solid axles give better articulation.

battlewagon,2l0tnd,Broken_Goat,0,Sun Nov 2 21:21:16 2014 UTC,"Fair enough, I hate it when people synonymize AWD and 4x4, but my point was that I wasn't excluding them, I was merely trying to define what ""wagon"" and ""battlewagon"" mean.  When I gave several subarus as non-wagon awd cars, it was literally because I looked out the window.  If my awd eagle talon shitbox had been sitting out there, too, I would have cited it as well, lol. But to throw more fuel on a long-burning fire: Civic wagons weren't 4wd, they were a reactive AWD.  Not arguing that solid axles are better for offroading. In fact, that's my point.  Our shitty articulation is what makes us unique.  Solid axles are basically cheating. ;)  You guys get a fair amount of snow out there, right?  Cause that's the reason why there are so many fucking soobies out here in Montucky.  But I'd be willing to bet that the reason we still have lots of old ones, and older cars in general, is because you're both closer to the salty air of the ocean, and you salt the roads in the winter, whereas we have neither."
battlewagon,2l0tnd,Cyfun06,2,Mon Nov 3 10:11:16 2014 UTC,"My Kia only had 5 inches of ground clearance before I lifted it which is comparable to an everyday car and even after my lift I have less than an inch more of ground clearance than a stock subaru xv. I do have a solid rear axle but it has no lockers anywhere in the world or upgrades as far as the gearing. And with ifs I feel like I definitely fit in here as compared to /r/4x4 where I was told ""do a solid axle swap and it would be cool""   This community is so positive compared to any other place but jeeps do not belong for a few simple reasons. 1: having solid axles front and rear makes modding and off-roading ridiculously easy compared to any other vehicle with ifs  2: /r/jeep and /r/4x4 would love to see your jeep doing some sweet off roading that would be impossible for almost all of us here."
battlewagon,2l0tnd,Shittypumpkin2,1 point,Sun Nov 2 14:22:06 2014 UTC,"I'm a fan of Sportages as well, and have one kicking around somewhere, but they are most definitely SUVs.  And even in stock form, they are extremely capable offroad.  You can't find a locker, though? I know they exist.  Their entire drivetrain is from a Mazda pickup.  And are you measuring ground clearance at the diff?  It's kind of apples and oranges comparing clearance between solid and independent axles."
battlewagon,2l0tnd,Cyfun06,1 point,Sun Nov 2 18:03:31 2014 UTC,"I measured at the front crossmember under the front diff, the lowest point of the car. I've been looking on a few blogs and haven't found anything for lockers unless I swap out the rear end out of the Mazda"
battlewagon,2l0tnd,Shittypumpkin2,5,Sun Nov 2 20:50:21 2014 UTC,"I agree.  That's cool if your registration or title says its a wagon my Loyale said it was silver when it was brown.  When i think wagon, i think a vehicle that is based on a sedan/car platform or has the option of being both.  I think the ""Small SUV"" requirement should be removed.  I want more wagons!  Subaru GL/Legacy/Impreza etc, Volvo V70/240, BMW 3 and 5 series, Audi A3/A4/A6.  Anything but Jeeps and SUVs."
battlewagon,2l0tnd,NeilOMalley,2,Sun Nov 2 07:34:43 2014 UTC,Agreed! We need more BMWs!
battlewagon,2l0tnd,Cyfun06,2,Sun Nov 2 08:11:12 2014 UTC,More Volvos (kinda haha) and even Mercedes too!
battlewagon,2l0tnd,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sun Nov 2 08:15:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but in offroad capacities. I actually had an old Volvo 240 that I was tempted to try to make 4 wheel drive.  They're actually pretty good for offroading as they're not only rear-wheel drive, but they use a Dana 30 rear end, which is the same as Jeeps, so you can easily toss in a locker.  In fact, a lot of the Volvo 740 and 940 turbos had factory auto-locking diffs.  The tricky part would be finding a good candidate for an engine/trans/front axle swap, but I bet Jeep XJ shit would be a good place to start.  The newer post-Ford-buyout Volvos are kinda shitty, and I've heard really difficult to lift.  At least they did make some decent AWD BMWs.  Almost bought a BMW 325ix a few years back, but the guy wanted a fuck-ton of money for it.  Did did AWD properly, though: 80% of the power to the rear, 20% to the front.  Once I get the fucker running, though, I'll have to show you guys my Audi 200 Avant turbo.  Climate control, heated seats, Torsen differentials, and a FACTORY LOCKING DIFF, BABY!"
battlewagon,2l0tnd,Cyfun06,7,Sun Nov 2 08:42:20 2014 UTC,"This.   I love jeeps. A lot.  That said...the spirit of r/battlewagons (at least as I see it) is to showcase vehicles that are doing things that are outside of their original design scope.  Was it sweet as shit to watch Jordan jackhammer the rim in the slam dunk contest? You bet it was. Was it 20 times cooler to watch Spud Webb? I sure think so.  To me, that's what r/battlewagons is all about. Blurring boundaries.  My two cents."

I have modded my jeep to the point that there isn't much challenge in anything other than serious rock crawls, and I seriously miss the days of taking a stock vehicle and pushing it to the limits.  That's why I like seeing your pics.  I give you my full up vote."

Just my opinion. FWIW, I don't have a wagon or Jeep. I just like the pictures."

However, it's hard to imagine someone finding one for $800, trimming the fenders with a saw-zall, rattle-canning emblems on the side, bolting up rusty home-made tube bumpers, and launching it off of jumps.

battlewagon,2l1f6a,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sun Nov 2 07:31:46 2014 UTC,Ah gotcha.  Most of the posters here seem to be using Yakima or Thule prebuilt bars.  I'm using Yakima rain gutter crossbars and a Yakima Load Warrior basket.  Most of the lightbars are also prebuilt for certain models only.  I don't think you will find anything prebuilt for your car though so you may have to get a custom one built.  Or use a police one like this http://www.fleetsafety.com/impala-push-bumper-grill-guard-06-present-by-go-rhino/
battlewagon,2l1f6a,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sun Nov 2 07:46:05 2014 UTC,"That's actually the exact one I was just looking at.

battlewagon,2kkidc,teamwrk,2,Wed Oct 29 00:45:58 2014 UTC,"Usually about 2"". If you use the forrester springs on them, 4"", but then you get into issues with driveline angles.  There's a Lift guide on DirtyImpreza.com you'll want to check out."

I had a 98 XJ back when I was at Ft Riley, KS and the only mods I did was better tires and I loved every second of it. There was nowhere it wouldn't take me, and long road trips were fun in it, too.  I think you're fine with what you got. That said, if you want to get into a truck with a smaller footprint, a Forester isn't a bad rig.   Keep in mind you're not going to be in MA forever, and at some point you're gonna want that SFA, low range and locking diffs."
battlewagon,2kivn3,bcvx,1 point,Tue Oct 28 13:23:41 2014 UTC,Well my buyer backed out so looks like it'll be mine for a while!   It's still a great jeep but it is pretty expensive to run as a high school student.

battlewagon,2kivn3,NeilOMalley,2,Tue Oct 28 18:09:16 2014 UTC,"Lift kits are available from several suppliers http://www.subaruforester.org/ and  http://offroadsubarus.com/ will get you heading in the right direction for lifts. Though for the most part you are still limited in tire size to 215/65 or thereabouts.  Locking diff is hard to do. The closest thing is the rear limit slip of a 2000-2002 forester S, or 2003- xs or xt  Reliability is pretty good other than the head gaskets. Once they are done, they are typically no longer a worry.  Gravel they do very well, Snow they do great (ground clearance and tire selection being the limiting factor) Mud only so so, again tire choice and clearance limit.  For winter road driving and ice the subaru really does great and it will be superior to the Jeep. The choice on the Jeep is between 4wd and 2wd. means that you either get all the power going to the rear wheels and forcing the front and rear axles to rotate the same amount while cornering (forces slip at the tires)  For off road the lack of a low range is a weakness for the manual cars."
battlewagon,2kivn3,Pizza_The_Hutt,1 point,Tue Oct 28 02:07:56 2014 UTC,For off road the lack of a low range is a weakness for the manual cars.   Do the newer Foresters have low range transmissions?
battlewagon,2kivn3,NeilOMalley,2,Tue Oct 28 04:21:28 2014 UTC,Subaru's stopped having a low range in North America in 1989.
battlewagon,2kivn3,archduke_troll,1 point,Tue Oct 28 06:13:27 2014 UTC,That's what I thought. I think Australia has them in newer years though.
battlewagon,2kivn3,bcvx,1 point,Tue Oct 28 14:39:26 2014 UTC,"Yep.  Australia, South America, And other places still do or have had them recently.  They stopped sending them to the US because it would classify them as a small truck which increases the taxes applied to it.  Its why the BRAT got jump seats, so it could be classified as a passenger vehicle to bypass the chicken tax.  Its dumb."
battlewagon,2kivn3,NeilOMalley,1 point,Tue Oct 28 14:44:32 2014 UTC,The choice on the Jeep is between 4wd and 2wd   Not true. Several ZJs and XJs had the NP242 transfer case which was a full-time/part-time 4x4. The FT 4WD is essentially AWD.
battlewagon,2kivn3,Patchespirate,1 point,Wed Nov 19 20:36:44 2014 UTC,How much slip did it allow between front and rear axels?
battlewagon,2kivn3,Jarlewski,2,Wed Nov 19 21:12:54 2014 UTC,"I would say for a basic overland/exploration rig a forester will do well.  The XJ would do it far better but the Subaru will do ok as long as you take it easy.  Those bumpers are from Australia and would be way expensive to import. No such thing as a locker unless you weld your diff. I would say do a 1 or 2"" lift, anything bigger requires a lot of work.  Put some all terrains on it and get out there.  Maybe find a 4.44 transmission to swap in later or see if a EA82 D/R unit would hold up for you.  These aren't exactly supported well in the aftermarket for real off road."

Count or take a pic of the threads on your steering rod and you're alignment will stay in check. First one might take 30 minutes, second one 10 minutes. Depending on the age of your car PB blaster will be your friend, also an impact with a deep socket always makes things better."

battlewagon,2kigu8,The_Wumbologist,2,Mon Oct 27 23:22:24 2014 UTC,You mean will your tires fit in your wheel wells without rubbing?  Because they will for sure fit your wheels.  I believe with such a small increase you should be good to go with stock offset wheels.
battlewagon,2kigu8,NeilOMalley,2,Mon Oct 27 23:28:11 2014 UTC,"Oh awesome, thats good to hear.  Regarding rubbing, with a 1"" spacer lift from stock height should the tires be ok or would I still have some rubbing?"
battlewagon,2kigu8,NeilOMalley,2,Mon Oct 27 23:29:45 2014 UTC,"Hard to say.  You're only making your tire 1"" total taller so only technically 1/2"" taller.  A 1"" spacer would help a little but I doubt it would rub in the first place."

battlewagon,2kigu8,chrwei,2,Tue Oct 28 00:51:42 2014 UTC,"Not sure how different it is on the 04, but on the 01 it doesn't take too much to start rubbing the spring seat on the strut, usually happens before it rubs on the wheel well. With that in mind, I am running 215x65x16 Grabbers now and they are fine."
battlewagon,2kigu8,bcvx,1 point,Tue Oct 28 01:12:39 2014 UTC,"and lift blocks won't help that either.  thinner would, but they don't make them thinner."
battlewagon,2kigu8,KiboshWasabi,1 point,Tue Oct 28 14:09:14 2014 UTC,spacers between the chassis and struts will increase ground clearance not clearance between the bottom of the spring and the tire.
battlewagon,2kigu8,Rilnac,2,Fri Oct 31 05:10:22 2014 UTC,215x.6x2=258. 258/25.4=10.15. 10.15+16=26.15  215.652=279.5. 279.5/25.4=11. 11+16=27  27-26.15=.85. So about 8/10 of an inch increase in overall diameter.

battlewagon,2kif3p,Denver80,3,Mon Oct 27 22:54:09 2014 UTC,"Well anytime you put larger tires on stock drivetrain you are defnintely going to be putting some extra stress on everything.  Gas mileage will go down, it will be a little more tipsy since your raising your center of gravity and you may be replacing bushings and other wear items a little bit quicker.  You will also want to consider that you have more rolling weight so your stopping distance may suffer depending on how heavy of a tire you go.  Do you want a brushguard/lightbar or a replacement front bumper?  You may need to look into some dedicated forums or communites to get some solid information."

battlewagon,2kg9zr,jnymoen,2,Mon Oct 27 14:06:18 2014 UTC,"Why would you want larger wheels?  Most Outbacks came with 15"" or 16"" rims, and those are the most common rim sizes for truck tires, not to mention the cheapest.  As others have suggested, you can squeeze 205/75R15s on without a lift.  Otherwise, you can buy or make some strut spacers, or throw down some more money for Forester struts.  I wouldn't worry too much about the bodywork, as the point of having a battlewagon is function over form.  Pry it out as best you can, and make sure the lights all work and that the headlights are aligned.  Also, have the timing belt and headgasket been replaced recently?  Cause if not, you'll want to do that soon.  And if the water pump already needs to be replaced, you'll want to replace the timing belt at the same time anyway."
battlewagon,2kg9zr,KiboshWasabi,3,Mon Oct 27 19:56:11 2014 UTC,I would try to jack it up and make sure the headgaskets arnt whats leaking.  Its a very common problem with these motors.  Also if your doing the water pump I would do the timing belt while you're there.

Well... today I punctured a hose that comes out the radiator so it's slowly dripping off, but I put a coolant bottle under it so hopefully if it leaks it goes back into the bottle. Also I think I bent something in the rear because the wheel sits awkwardly with a bit of positive camber... I was offroading hard today ;)  To answer your question: Body parts such as hood, bumper and front fender, the hatch, and the rear bumper. The rims and the brake parts if possible. Interior wise the seats and the door cards possibly, as well as the instrument panel (hopefully it goes in well), also the floor mats ;) underbody wise I think I'll take whatever parts from the rear suspension that i would need for the forester lift kit and if I can salvage the struts I'll use the struts (of course with the spring still in it). Engine wise I'm using the brand new spark plugs and wires as well as the air filter and the battery (that I have to clean of corrosion). Accessory and lighting wise I want to take off the roof rack and install it on my daily, also salvage the lights and bulbs as well. I think that would be about it for this car. The shell is fine except for some dings and perforation on the rear quarter panels. Exhaust is in okay condition last time I checked (When I bought it, but i don't know about now, I hit a couple rocks while offroading ;) ) The interior is in very good shape, shame that I don't like phase 1 interiors."

But on the other hand, this might be easier to lift, especially in the front, since it has no axles up there.  And if all else fails, put it on a Blazer frame.  Something that just occurred to me, though: a guy made a hybrid Fiero that's electric in front and stock engine in back.  How cool of an offroader would that be?  You could go one step further and put an electric motor on each front wheel, eliminating the need for a diff, and giving you equal torque to both wheels."

With a novel light-weight unibody design,  it set the stage for the modern sport utility vehicle (SUV). The XJ's innovative appearance and sales popularity spawned several imitators - most importantly the Ford Explorer - as other automakers began to notice that this model began replacing regular cars.  It was built in Toledo, Ohio, in Beijing, China, in Ferreyra, Argentina, and in Valencia, Venezuela. The XJ provided the mechanical basis for the MJ-series Jeep Comanche pickup truck.

Whether that's an Outback, or an Impreza, or Buick Century, it doesn't matter. It's not the vehicle, it's the mindset."

I've pulled many a car out with it, and am considering mounting a winch somewhere for Extra lols. At the very least for this coming summer, i want to devise a way to mount a dirt bike to it, so i can take it out as far as i can go, then keep on riding. It's light, and has wide tires, floats across mud and sand. Its pretty hilarious when I have to pull a jeep out.

battlewagon,2juvlw,SmallSubBot,1 point,Tue Oct 21 03:59:44 2014 UTC,"Great install!  I highly recommend not using your recovery eyelet for your safety chain.  In the event your hitch fails the asymmetrical pull on the trailer with cause you more problems than just a trailer gone rouge.   Weld a couple chain links or recover hoops on the underside of the tow bar on each side of the hitch receiver. Try to keep them as symmetrically as possible and be sure when you attached the safety chains, cross the left to the right and right to the left. The symmetry and crossing links will add stability if the trailer hitch ever fails   Happy towing!"

Around my neck of the woods, it's the #1 way to get a ticket for towing to not have then crossed.   Also, don't let them hang lower than 2"" off the ground. I can tell you from experience, it sucks to fix chains after you ground the shit out of them. It took me 1 trip, about 50 miles, to half the links grinding.

battlewagon,2juzcf,xTrekSuubie,4,Tue Oct 21 04:43:25 2014 UTC,"No, they do not work. Ever. They've been around for years. Usually without the knob. Sometimes sold as ""MPG improvers!"" ""Tuners!"" or other such bullshit. All they do is modify the signal from the MAF (or MAP, they really don't care), and tell your ECU that it's flowing more air. Sometimes, they'll also do that to the IAT, or the coolant sensor, or some other sensor that controls fueling. Bottom line though: If you don't have a wideband connected to it, you're wasting money and time. Furthermore, any modern ECU is going to check the MAF/MAP signal against the o2 sensor, and ""Learn around it"" pretty quickly (By adjusting the fueling map back to an ideal A/F ratio). So you're literally doing nothing. (well, except for hacking apart your perfectly reliable factory wiring and replacing it with questionable aftermarket variable resistors, and even more questionable connectors) Save your money. Buy tires."

Not sure how big of a tire you can run as the wheel wells on the newer gens is much smaller.  All of Scott's newer kits are well built and seem to hold up well.  Its fun seeing all his crazy ideas.
battlewagon,2jm8hp,NeilOMalley,1 point,Sun Oct 19 00:14:36 2014 UTC,"Hah, maybe you're right. My only fear is lifting it too much and not being able to fit big enough tires for it to look good.   Check out this Baja build. He went with the 4"" lift, but stuck way bigger tires on it (235/70/16). I think that looks extremely good.  Here's the only other Outback that is lifted 4"" that I know of and it doesn't look like it's lifted nearly as much as the Baja. Is that just me?"
battlewagon,2jm8hp,95blackz26,1 point,Sun Oct 19 00:45:36 2014 UTC,I've seen the Baja before.  That guy is on the USMB with us.  The outback is definitely not as high because he has tiny tires on it.  They look stock.  Most of your actual height gain is from the tires not the lift.  A lift is mostly so you can fit larger tires as you gain very little with the lift alone.
battlewagon,2jm8hp,95blackz26,1 point,Sun Oct 19 01:04:53 2014 UTC,"Oh awesome, I didn't know that he was on there.  Most people have told me there's fitment issues with Gen 2 Outbacks and the tires I ordered (215/65/16s) are pretty much as big as I can fit.   In that post, he says that it's the rear doors and the front by the inward back of the wheel well that causes most of the issue with running larger tires and that 29"" tires are barely 1/2"" from the spring perch and that's what limits me to a 29"" tire as well (I got 27"" tires for now.)

For some reason, I'm afraid of something becoming complicated even though it seems pretty cut and dry. My biggest fear is the sway bar being a pain to reconnect in the rear after lifting, but maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. I may just have my brother help me out if you think it'll be that easy.

battlewagon,2jba9i,SonVolt,22,Wed Oct 15 12:53:02 2014 UTC,"Audi/VW Technician here.  The rest of the responses pretty much nail it.  The air suspension is complex, expensive to diagnose and to repair.  A steel spring conversion is a somewhat popular thing people do. Another option, if your struts start leaking, are replacement ones from a company called Arnott.  The 2.7 biturbo engine has its own problem areas as well.  They commonly leak coolant from a crossover pipe and after-run coolant pump that are both underneath the intake manifold.  Should the turbos fail, replacing them requires removal of the engine.  Valve cover gaskets and cam adjuster seals commonly leak oil, but the same is true on 1.8t's, 2.8 v6 and 4.2 v8 engines.   I mean....OVERALL the C5 (not B5) chassis Audis are pretty stout.  Its just that there are so many ways that an Allroad can cost you money.  Even with me being able to perform the repairs myself and being able to buy parts for cost, I'd still be wary to own one.  I had the opportunity to buy one from a customer who didn't want to fix it, but I chickened out.  Bought a nice 2000 Passat V6 4Motion wagon instead."

battlewagon,2jba9i,guitarsandguns,7,Wed Oct 15 17:43:21 2014 UTC,"The B5 Passats are very reliable, and a personal favorite of mine.  Also, anything with a 2.8 V6 or 4.2 V8 is a pretty safe bet.  1.8t's are pretty good, but can be prone to sludge buildup/oil pressure problems if the oil wasn't regularly changed...full synthetic, 5000 miles. Beware the 3.0 V6 in the later C5 chassis A6 as they're prone to premature cam wear...and STAY FAR FAR AWAY from W8's."

It's got some snow tires on it, climbed a 50 degree hill the other day in it with nearly no wheel slip. It also hoons my dirt track perfectly sideways, in style and comfort.  Only about $2500 invested so far (cost of truck), buuuuut I've decided I'll be flipping it.  I've replaced the valve cover gasket and will be doing some other seals in the head area to track down this oil leak. I've also had to solder up the radiator after I ran over a dead deer the other day. The axle of the fan punctured the radiator. That required removing the bumper and a good bunch of parts.  The air bag suspension light comes on from time to time. Time to get rid of this thing before I lose any chance of breaking even. I'll stick with the turbo RT4WD. =]"
battlewagon,2jba9i,njhiker,5,Wed Oct 15 16:41:01 2014 UTC,"Yes, yes they are.  I'd suggest either an H6 Outback (auto only), or an XT (turbo) if you want a manual transmission.  Same general idea, much more reliable, and still pretty comfy in Limited trim.  Allroads are really cool cars though - it's a shame they're so damn difficult and expensive to maintain."

So, I go around bitching and moaning that they're bullshit pains in the ass (and if the A4 is already so difficult, I can only imagine what the Allroad must be like seeing as how it's so much more high-tech and high-end).  But I still feel funny feelings in my pants whenever I see an Allroad.  Or an S4 wagon."

battlewagon,2jba9i,Powdershuttle,3,Fri Oct 17 12:23:23 2014 UTC,"I guess I'm a little late to the party but, I think what it comes down to is the air ride ALONG WITH the repair/maintenance bills. Once the air ride breaks, it's tough to pinpoint whats wrong without taking it to a dealer for a few hours and a few hundred dollars of trouble shooting. Even then, one busted o-ring can put you out of commission again.  As for conversion kits http://www.blauparts.com/audi_allroad_suspension/audi_allroad_airbag_suspension_conversion_kit.html (sorry for the long url I'm on mobile) Gives a good overview of what can go wrong with the air suspension and a coilover kit to replace it, for just over $1000. I guess it's up to you if you want to spend a little less than a quarter of what you paid for the car on just replacing suspension. The COOL thing is that they are still (manually) adjustable and you can get some lift from them.   As for just basic maintenance, the Audi name carries luxury prices. Even for basic stuff like brakes, a 2005 Subaru Outback (which you can get with leather heated seats btw) will be under $400 even if you don't do it yourself, while the allroad most likely starts at around $500 if you take it in.   The other thing is, many of the ones available for cheap are coming up on or have passed 10 years old. This means much of the rubber; gaskets, o-rings, weather stripping, hoses, and bushings are close to failing if they haven't been replaced already. While none are a major repair, stuff like that can add up and get annoying to replace even if you do it all at once.   As for engines, it's generally thought that the NA 4.2 is more reliable than the more common 2.7T but I haven't really done my research about that.   Overall I think it's a cool platform, if you have the money for the Audi name. I think it would make a cool dedicated battle wagon as opposed to a battle wagon/ daily driver."

battlewagon,2j2ud1,teamwrk,2,Mon Oct 13 03:00:15 2014 UTC,Just the e-brake cable.  It seems to be OK with stock everything else.  The rear pads are definitely working as it has rubbed the rust away.  Where is the proportioning valve located?  The donor junkyard legacy is still available for parts if I need to pull more stuff.  Edit:  quick google-fu has shown me the way.  I wonder if it's different from stock rear drum to stock rear disc.
battlewagon,2j2ud1,teamwrk,2,Mon Oct 13 05:24:34 2014 UTC,"The prop valve is the small metal component (possibly a cylinder, varies between models and years) in the engine bay. You should see five brake lines (the hard variety) running to it. I can take pictures of mine if you'd like.  I've seen conflicting opinions in whether or not it's necessary when doing a rear disc swap. My understanding is that more pressure is allocated to rear disc brakes than drums, thus using the stock valve you will see the fronts heat and wear faster than the rears.  That said, I spoke with the owner of my local Subaru shop. He said he used to do rear disc swaps on GLs all the time back in the day, and they seldom lost sleep over the prop valve."
battlewagon,2j2ud1,ABangler,2,Mon Oct 13 05:42:00 2014 UTC,Maybe I'll swing back by the junkyard and see if the valve is still on the car.  If it is I'll pick it up and swap it.
battlewagon,2j2ud1,reallifedog,2,Mon Oct 13 14:42:01 2014 UTC,Is this doable on any vehicle with drums in the rear? I'd like to swap em out on my 98 silverado.
battlewagon,2j2ud1,reallifedog,1 point,Mon Oct 13 14:40:06 2014 UTC,"Possibly.  It's easier if you can find the same make/model that has stock rear discs and just pull the entire assembly from the donor vehicle.  Here's a kit you can buy, but it's expensive $900:  http://www.summitracing.com/parts/sum-bk1402-x/overview/year/1998/make/chevrolet/model/c1500"

The knuckles look pretty different(OBW is integrated into the trailing arm)so Im not sure they will work, anyone done this? Also, the brakes are threaded on the OBW and the FOZ the knuckles are threaded.   I'm wondering if we can just drill out the threads from the OBW brake....  Thanks"

I worked for the company that is selling these for years and we sold a ton of them. They are one of the largest independent dealers in the country and they hire really knowledgeable staff.

battlewagon,2iwpdy,mcthreadski,1 point,Sat Oct 11 01:31:35 2014 UTC,"These work well and are your cheapest and most efficient option but, if you go this route, make sure you to choose foam that coincides with your kayak's hull shape."

I bought one off of Amazon for about a hundred bucks and it's held up super well. There are bars made to hook onto your roof basket that stick off the size to seat a kayak but I'm not sure who makes them. I'll look.  I can link both soon but I'm on my phone atm.

battlewagon,2ivjhn,SaidTheBear,6,Fri Oct 10 18:02:46 2014 UTC,"For a small lift the easiest/cheapest route is spacers. You can buy them online (there is actually a free shipping offer on these for our sub-reddit, details here), or if you are feeling adventurous you can try making your own. Personally I'm looking at buying raw HDPE locally and then just machining some out of that.  Gorilla also makes a really tough front light/bush bar, they have a video of someone jumping up and down on it, but it isn't exactly cheap. I've been holding off on getting that in hopes of something cheaper or meaner-looking being available.  For any off-roading you should also consider some oil pan protection. Since it is located so far forward and down, it is really easy to smash. And the stock plastic skid plate is a bunch of crap."

The pricing for the ""Gorilla Offroad Bar"" is the same regardless of the vehicle you are buying for. The pricing breaks down as follows:  $565 - Gorilla Offroad Bar FREE - Gorilla Black powder coat finish FREE - Between 4 to 8 light tabs (model dependent) $195 - Skid Plate (optional) $165 - Winch Mount (optional - omits two inner bottom light tabs) $195 - Winch Mount w/D-Ring Shackle Tabs (optional - omits two inner bottom light tabs) $125 - D-Ring Shackle Tabs (w/out winch) $145 to $225 - Shipping estimates depending on location and country"
battlewagon,2ivjhn,Rilnac,2,Fri Oct 10 18:41:17 2014 UTC,"To expand upon this, the Gorilla bar uses metal tubes that mount to the front subframe section on the front and at the sides, and also to the support plate under the front crossmember. The skid plate then mounts to the underside of the tubes, effectively using the bar as a spacer to help clear the oil pan and drain plug."

battlewagon,2ilykg,teamwrk,4,Tue Oct 7 23:52:54 2014 UTC,"Dedicated snow tires are always going to be the proper way to do it.

battlewagon,2ilykg,Hamingtonxx,3,Wed Oct 8 03:34:28 2014 UTC,"Buy dedicated winter tires.  Using winter tires a couple times in summer won't kill them. They will wear faster than all seasons, but it sounds like you'll be swapping on the weekends only."
battlewagon,2ilykg,brzcory,1 point,Wed Oct 8 01:21:58 2014 UTC,"The problem is that a good winter tire will be made of a soft rubber that remains flexible at low temperatures.  However, they will wear like crazy in warmer weather.  So unless you wanna spend $600 every year on a new set of tires, keep two sets of tires, or just run an aggressive all-season all year round.

battlewagon,2ikthk,NeilOMalley,3,Tue Oct 7 22:10:31 2014 UTC,Lowest safe point would be essentially your ground clearance.  Anything above that and you are looking at getting water in your rear diff and transmission (Not 100% on those heights).  You should also worry about your radiator fan.  Hitting water with it can break blades or pull it into the radiator.  On my rig I have installed a custom fan harness that I can turn on manually.  I also extended my rear diff breather to almost 4' high.  Also the oil dip stick is pretty low and not sealed.  Also yes its normal for the engine and exhaust to produce steam.  They get very hot and the cold water definitely boils off when it touches it.  Also something to consider is the extreme change in temp can possibly cause issues.
battlewagon,2ikthk,chrwei,2,Tue Oct 7 23:33:56 2014 UTC,"I was worried about the steaming, am I wrong to assume the very fast cooling and contracting of the submerged metals could be problematic?  Thanks for the advice!"
battlewagon,2ikthk,THEMCV,1 point,Wed Oct 8 01:19:16 2014 UTC,I have heard of exhaust manifolds cracking if the temperature swing is great enough.

Being that the business is in Australia it cost more than it probably should have; however he liked what they had.   For the price of some of those and depending if you just want a nudge bar, it might be cheaper to find a small metal fabrication shop or mechanic to make you one. Hope that helps."
battlewagon,2ij8ij,kevinpdx,2,Tue Oct 7 21:15:03 2014 UTC,Custom is definitely going to be your best bet.  Very few if any anymore companies build bars.  Most of them will be a light duty light bar/winch mount combo.  Good for mounting some lights and running a very small winch but not really anything super heavy duty.  It all depends on what you want to do with it also.  Do you want to wheel hard or just keep it tame?
battlewagon,2ij8ij,NeilOMalley,1 point,Tue Oct 7 23:38:58 2014 UTC,"Nothing too crazy. My build plan is something among the lines of Fozzy shocks/struts with a 1"" spacer, General Grabber AT 2 215/75-15 Tires, then replace the front bumper with something sort of like /u/Pizza_The_Hutt has got.

If you're looking for bull bars, none of those will really cut it as far as strength, while they mount solidly, they're not intended to take severe impacts. Gorilla's product would probably be the closest for this, as it mounts directly to 4 points on the underside of the car, two of which I believe are on a subframe."

battlewagon,2iepsr,captobvious24,1 point,Mon Oct 6 01:49:01 2014 UTC,it'd be a decent platform to get into offroading(especially at that price point) but it is not exactly a battlewagon.
battlewagon,2iepsr,reallifedog,1 point,Mon Oct 6 14:10:57 2014 UTC,Could you give a quick list as to what would be a good intro battlewagon?
battlewagon,2iepsr,NeilOMalley,3,Mon Oct 6 20:22:37 2014 UTC,90-96 Subaru Legacys with the Phase 1 ej22.  Plentiful and cheap to purchase and maintain.  What do you want to do with your rig?
battlewagon,2iepsr,NeilOMalley,2,Mon Oct 6 21:49:57 2014 UTC,Some decent offroading and capable of handling mud and water.
battlewagon,2iepsr,kingfrito_5005,2,Mon Oct 6 23:25:14 2014 UTC,"Like deep mud and water and trails or like unmaintained forest roads?  If you want to get into some more hardcore offroad stuff you could look into Gen3 Subaru GL wagons.  You can get a dual range transmission in them.  It does require a lot of work to maintain and would probably not make a decent daily driver.  A Legacy with around 4"" of lift would allow for moderate sized tires without too much cutting and would be capable of getting over some rough stuff.  The definition of offroad can vary widely so its hard to say what would fit for you.  You may want to even look into 4runners or other suv type rigs for better offroad and capacity."

battlewagon,2ibt7o,curiouschurro,2,Sun Oct 5 06:24:50 2014 UTC,"This is awesome. The tires aren't something I'm used to, what's a tread like this supposed to be for? Deep snow?"
battlewagon,2ibt7o,curiouschurro,4,Sun Oct 5 14:00:09 2014 UTC,"The tires are off of the Aton-Impulse VIKING-2992, which is an amphibious car. Basically, they're the barrels you see on the edge of a raft, to make it float, while at the same time being capable of going over snow or through mud or on the street. Also, since it was designed to be a disaster relief vehicle, they tried to make them as low-impact as possible as far as destroying the soil/environment, which might also account for their unique shape.  http://www.atonimpulse.com/Welcome_to_Aton_Impulse.html  and if you want to make some yourself:   http://bushcraftusa.com/forum/showthread.php/50078-Russian-off-road-self-made-car?p=873045&viewfull=1#post873045"

Whenever I test drive a vehicle I might use offroad, or am testing out a new lift or new tires to see if it rubs, I drive to the nearest one of these and see how far up I can go before I get spin.  It's also a great way to test if something has limited slip as well."

battlewagon,2i5qr8,NeilOMalley,2,Fri Oct 3 14:10:14 2014 UTC,Yeah me to. I built my lift with 3/8th steel blocks all the way around and linked together.  We stress our rigs more than most so we need that strength to survive the trails.
battlewagon,2i5qr8,YepImanEmokid,1 point,Fri Oct 3 19:31:37 2014 UTC,"I steered away from doing it this way at first, but for what it'll be used for I think it'll be fine. According to the website those little spacers can withstand 60,000lbs but who knows it that's accurate. I also used 3/8"" grade 8 bolts, so I had to drill that struts and mounting holes out to fit. So they are bigger than original and snug in the 3/8"" holes so no moving around. Lastly there""s lock washers on the top and bottom and they're all pretty accessible and easy to see if they're still tight. With all that I'm thinking it'll probably be ok unless I go sliding into something sideways and putting alot of force on the strut."
battlewagon,2i5qr8,YepImanEmokid,1 point,Fri Oct 3 22:04:27 2014 UTC,"They may be strong vertical force I would be more worried about horizontal force.  I've seen some other kits that use separate pieces for the struts and they always bend.  I used 6"" 1/4 tube and 3/8th plates for my spacers.  Like I said.  For street and dirt roads you should be good.  We use ours for some pretty hardcore stuff so we build the kits to be stronger than the car.  Good luck.  Keep us posted."

battlewagon,2i24rw,Pizza_The_Hutt,7,Thu Oct 2 03:29:02 2014 UTC,There is!  Was working on one of these for my GL for when I sleep in the back.  Just take the plastic covers off the inside of the hatch and look at the mechanism.  It should be a simple matter of hooking some wire or cable to the linkage.  Do it in a way that bypasses the lock.  Then just drill a hole in your plastic cover and fish the wire through.
battlewagon,2i24rw,Cyfun06,2,Thu Oct 2 04:33:25 2014 UTC,Yes!  I'll take it apart tomorrow when I get home from work and take some pics for documentation purposes.  Hopefully it's somewhat of the same mechanism from the earlier models.

I've put a new 4x4 vac actuator in it to get the 4wd working, removed a broken key from the ignition, replaced the dryrotted and cracked air intake assembly, tune up, changed/topped all the fluids, replaced the broken windshield sprayer assembly, bunches of other small things. Having a problem with a really bad idle that smooths out when I unplug the O2 sensor, sad thing is the O2 sensor is either galled or rusted to the exhaust because no amount of torch heat or penetrating oil will break it loose. I just use it for pulling my ATV's, which its not too great at (0-60 never when its loaded down) which is funny since its the 4.3 vortec.

What year is it.  mix up a 50/50 solution of acetone and atf, and put that on the O2 bung when it's hot. Watch out because it will light off if it's hot enough, but it will burn out. Hit it again when it burns off. Then hit it again in a minute or 2. wait 15 mins and then try and un-bolt it. should come right out."

battlewagon,2hqppg,BeerPowered,1 point,Mon Sep 29 05:06:15 2014 UTC,sends maybe 30% of the power to the back wheels once the fronts start slipping   Isn't this exactly how subarus work?

battlewagon,2hqppg,BeerPowered,1 point,Mon Sep 29 15:29:38 2014 UTC,Really? I thought that most newer models had the front wheels connected directly to the tans and either a viscus coupling (manual) or clutch pack (auto) to connect the rear wheels and shunt power as the front wheels slip. Anywhere I can read about how the mechanism actually works?
battlewagon,2hqppg,TheScriptKiddie,1 point,Mon Sep 29 19:34:39 2014 UTC,"I think they have center viscous LSD. Since if one driveshaft fails the car is able to move it just feels like the clutch is slipping. At least that's what happens with older Subarus, I don't know about new cars."
battlewagon,2hqppg,Cyfun06,2,Mon Sep 29 19:52:10 2014 UTC,I found a diagram that clears up my confusion. They do use a viscous LSD rather than an ordinary viscous coupling. The diff has a very funny shape that makes it look like it only has one output shaft at first glance.  http://www.awdwiki.com/images/subaru-mt-diff-visco.jpg
battlewagon,2hqppg,YummierGore,2,Mon Sep 29 21:30:24 2014 UTC,"yep the early evos have a viscous centre diff (some LSD, i think mine is semi-LSD) and its located inside the gearbox, the two front wheels get their drive straight from the gearbox (like a FWD would) and the rear wheels get their power from the transfer case (which bolts directly to the left side of the gearbox). 4WD systems are weird... but awesome!"

Cooling systems consists of radiator, thermostat, hoses/pipes, water pump, and expansion bottle/reservoir. Plus some fans on the radiator.  how does the coolant look?"
battlewagon,2hkdje,ipper,1 point,Mon Sep 29 01:09:03 2014 UTC,"its pretty consistent. After about 5-10 minutes of driving it starts to overheat, no matter the type of driving I'm doing. One fan on the radiator isn't working and I haven't had a chance to look at the wiring. The coolant looks good to me."
battlewagon,2hkdje,Cyfun06,1 point,Mon Sep 29 06:02:44 2014 UTC,"Does at least one radiator fan kick on though? If so, then that's not the problem.  One thing to check is that your radiator isn't clogged with mud.  Also, it itself could be clogged and have poor flow.  Easy way to test this theory is to drain the rad into a bucket and remove it.  If there's a lot of nasty crap in the bucket, that's a bad sign.  But once you have the rad removed, turn it upside down and make sure it's empty.  Then stick a hose in one end and see how fast it flows out the other.  Keep alternating ends to see if you can flush some crap out.  Also, rather than replacing the thermostat, just remove it completely.  It's possible you may have installed it backwards, or misoriented it and gotten an air bubble.  Aside from that, another thing to try is to put the radiator back in and attach the lower hose, but leave the upper disconnected. Stick a garden hose in the upper neck of the radiator and fill the engine with water until it flows out of the upper hose (you'll need the thermostat removed for this).  Once it's full, start the car and see how fast it pumps out water.  This will give you an idea if your pump is shot.  One thing you can also do here is keep pumping cold water into the radiator and letting the car run for half an hour.  See how hot the water is when it comes out of the upper hose, and watch your dash temp gauge to see what it says.  If you suspect your system might be clogged, you can put some wood bleach in to flush it.  Google how to do that, as it's a specific amount, and you'll also want to get some washing soda to neutralize it later.  But if all else fails... how long has it been since you changed your timing belt?  If it's been a while, might as well change it and the pulleys and water pump.  You can get a decent kit on ebay for about $80.  Also... have you checked your compression lately?  If you have a headgasket leak, it could blow hot air into your cooling system.  If you're losing coolant but dont see any drips around the water pump or hoses or rad, this could be the culprit."
battlewagon,2hj5xn,toyota22RE,2,Fri Sep 26 14:53:40 2014 UTC,cheapest way: pack the struts with marine ply cutouts.
battlewagon,2hj5xn,Speye,1 point,Fri Sep 26 23:03:38 2014 UTC,Contact King Springs to see if they also do a lifted spring for the AE 95. They do the standard height.  Industrial Springs in Australia also make a inch lift rear spring for it.

battlewagon,2hj5xn,BeerPowered,0,Fri Sep 26 15:06:55 2014 UTC,Go to a wrecking yard and find longer springs that do fit.
battlewagon,2hj5xn,Shittypumpkin2,1 point,Sat Sep 27 12:08:01 2014 UTC,That would actually only work solid axles that don't use struts and you would still need longer shocks. The best way for this vehicle I believe would be spacers on top of the strut made either out of high density plastic that bathroom stall doors are made of or good old steel.
battlewagon,2hj5xn,BeerPowered,2,Sat Sep 27 14:40:50 2014 UTC,"I'm not talking about ridiculous lifts, just several centimeters to compensate all the suspension sag that has happened through years of abuse. Although yes, simple spacers are probably the best option for this car."

battlewagon,2hhj77,duminacan,3,Fri Sep 26 01:19:55 2014 UTC,"I believe I have gone as wide as 235 on a 6.5"" wheel, but that was a lower profile tire. If you're going with a higher profile tire you could go wider (10.5"" wide is common on 7"" jeep wheels). You would obviously need a significant lift to accommodate much taller or wider tires. Maybe spacers. I'm not positive. A lot of it is all in your suspension setup and maybe some fender/liner trimming.  The other limiting factor is going to be tire choice. There are a few all season options in 235/55/16. More options with a taller sidewall (substantially larger than stock diameter. Beyond that you start having to do some pretty big tires, 255/65/16 and bigger. Then you not only have fitment problems, but gearing/power problems. Both an be overcome, but it's a matter of how serious you're getting."

battlewagon,2h2s88,Rilnac,2,Mon Sep 22 02:31:12 2014 UTC,"The problem happens if the air inside your lights is warmed up and the housing is submerged. The water cools the air, which creates negative pressure, sucking water in to the housing and making contact with the bulbs.  I have heard you are 'relatively' protected against hydrolock since the intake is designed to cause a stall before water makes it in to the engine. But that is not something I would ever want to test. Really if you don't have a snorkel you shouldn't mess with any water that can reach your engine bay."

I realize those ratings are not constant manufacture to manufacture but I suspect life would be similar.   It's a light, well aligned car and I'm not too hard on tires. Any tire after 50k is noisy anyway so I'd replace them in the US around that point."

They were the grippiest tire I've ever had and they worked really well even in torrential downpours, crappy on ice.  Never did any real offroading in them but probably just as good as any other 3 season tire"
battlewagon,2giw75,NWAForester,7,Tue Sep 16 02:59:20 2014 UTC,"That thing was in there pretty good! Nice work getting it out!  I should mention though that I don't think it's good to do the snapping method of pulling people out on our cars (as effective as it is). It actually can bend the subframe. :( Just thought I'd let you know. :)  Great video, though. :)"
battlewagon,2giw75,THEMCV,9,Tue Sep 16 03:17:35 2014 UTC,"For jobs such as this using a properly designed Snatch Strap, which is designed to stretch and absorb the load, is highly recommended.  I would also recommend hanging a damper in the middle to catch the strap in case of a failure.  Also possibly using both strap points as not to swing your vehicle when the strap tightens.  Subaru's aren't much for towing (ive managed to remove a couple hooks) but have some experience towing out other rigs with my Tacoma."
battlewagon,2giw75,NeilOMalley,1 point,Tue Sep 16 04:24:21 2014 UTC,"See, I thought I read even with the snatch straps you aren't supposed to do that on a unibody... I definitely could be wrong! That's just what I've heard. :)  I'm electing for a nice winch in the future. ;)"
battlewagon,2giw75,THEMCV,2,Tue Sep 16 04:37:14 2014 UTC,Well technically you are not supposed to use the hooks on a Subaru for anything other than strapping it down for transporting it.  They were not designed to be used for recovery operations or hard jolts.  But a recovery strap would at least help.  A winch would definitely help but the problem is where to mount it without stretching the whole body.  I have my winch plate set up but i am pretty sure I am going to have to subframe my car to keep it from tearing the front end off.
battlewagon,2giw75,NeilOMalley,2,Tue Sep 16 04:42:26 2014 UTC,"There is a dude I  saw locally last winter with a snowplow on the front of his 1st gen legacy wagon.

So maybe I will catch him this year."

battlewagon,2giw75,kstorm88,1 point,Sat Oct 4 15:12:33 2014 UTC,"I didn't really think about that, which makes me worried to put a front winch on.   You don't think a tube bumper welded into the bumper mounts would be enough to keep the bumper on the car with a winch on it?"
battlewagon,2giw75,THEMCV,1 point,Tue Sep 16 11:41:08 2014 UTC,"Well technically you are not supposed to use the hooks on a Subaru for anything other than strapping it down for transporting it.   Yep, this is the reason I was somewhat surprised by this Subaru commercial.

battlewagon,2giw75,HindleMcCrindleberry,1 point,Tue Sep 16 18:06:55 2014 UTC,"By the way, I was actually wondering if you legitimately thought a welded tube bumper would hold a winch. :) Not trying to come off rude if I did. :)"
battlewagon,2giw75,THEMCV,2,Tue Sep 16 19:18:08 2014 UTC,A properly built tube bumper will definitely hold a winch.  I've seen lots with up to 12k winches.  The issue is if the car will hold the bumper.  Hard pulls stress a lot more than just the mount point.  I tore my tow hooks off so I am going to attach my bumper and skid plate to the cross member and lift blocks to tie the whole front end together.
battlewagon,2giw75,NeilOMalley,1 point,Tue Sep 16 19:35:58 2014 UTC,"Okay, I see. I'm not sure about risking it with adding a tube bumper and a winch now...  I know Gorilla Off-Roads bar/winch mount/skid plate all connect underneath the car to give it some more durability.

battlewagon,2giw75,THEMCV,1 point,Tue Sep 16 20:29:10 2014 UTC,Go for it!  Just know what could happen when you stress it a lot.  Even the Gorilla Off-Road bars are putting more stress on every part they connect to.  Just have to remember we are pushing road cars pretty hard compared to most people.

battlewagon,2giw75,bragis,1 point,Tue Sep 16 09:01:44 2014 UTC,"Well, my theory, was that reverse is a lower gear, and it allowed me to easily see what was happening."

battlewagon,2giw75,BeerPowered,1 point,Wed Sep 17 01:43:07 2014 UTC,Reverse has slower ratio. Going faster would rip the rope and kill somebody or at least break a window.

battlewagon,2giw75,Cyfun06,2,Wed Sep 17 01:34:29 2014 UTC,"It has the same ratios for first and second but for reverse it had a 3.416, so it was actually higher."

battlewagon,2giw75,BeerPowered,2,Tue Sep 16 09:25:44 2014 UTC,Needed a bit of weight in the subaru to get more traction
battlewagon,2giw75,BeerPowered,2,Tue Sep 16 21:36:14 2014 UTC,"Not to thread-crap, but that was terrible technique.  Firstly, should have stuck with pulling him forward and straight out, as you weren't at a funny angle and at risk of going through a fence, plus he wouldn't have falling back in the same damn hole as he did.  Second, in such a low-traction situation, a heavy one-wheel drive car is going to be more useful than a light AWD car, as inertia becomes more important than traction.  Third, having people standing around so close is just asking for them to get hit by a broken strap or run over.  Fourth, along those lines, you need to work on how you attach straps to vehicles, as this one fell off several times, and had it fallen off while you were pulling, could have lead to my concern in the previous sentence.  Fifth, you honestly would have been better off standing behind the van and having a couple of people push on it, rocking it back and forth until you could bounce it out of the hole.  People tend to have better traction than cars, plus you can lift upward while you do it to gain traction and lift the vehicle out of the hole.  What I would have done, though, if there weren't enough people to help push, is attached my tow rope to the front of the van, but pulled it at a perpendicular angle to the left.  That would make it so you're only pulling one wheel out at a time, and the leverage of the front of the van pivoting around would have helped lift his rear right wheel out of the hole.  Once it came around, I'd keep my moment up, and when the van became parallel with me, it would have pulled the rear left wheel out.  Source: I spend several months a year pulling people out of the snow."
battlewagon,2giw75,BeerPowered,2,Tue Sep 16 22:22:42 2014 UTC,"Well, you are right, but I am a noob, lol, I bet your first attempts were by no means flawless.  On to your points... Firstly, it doesn't look like it in the video, but towing the van forward was up hill, so i changed trying not fight gravity any more than needed. Secondly, awd was my only choice. Third, good point!!! Fourth, the cheap little spring loaded tabs that keep them from falling off, got bent earlier in the day, allowing them to slip off when fully slacked. D-ring upgrade for this winter to be done. Fifth, the biggest hurdle was the driver of the van seemed to think the throttle was an on off switch, i finally told him to quit doing anything till it was actually moving. And also, pushing with a bunch of people had been tried, and gotten muddy, lol, this was a 'last ditch' effort, pun intended, lol  I like your idea, thats a great approach to remember for this coming winter, thanks for the tips!!!"

battlewagon,2gblk7,THEMCV,4,Sat Sep 13 22:02:10 2014 UTC,From my experience I would go with the lift first. I bought tires first and had problems with rubbing when I would turn or go over bumps (probably because I went from 26 inch to 33 inch tires and a different offset wheels) plus it's nice to get under the vehicle and see any other trouble areas before you get too far along. Hopefully this helps!
battlewagon,2gblk7,Shittypumpkin2,4,Sun Sep 14 00:34:48 2014 UTC,"I second this. Don't wanna fuck up a nice set of tires by gouging them on your fenders.  Also, IMHO, taller tires are rather over-rated as they gear an already tall-gear vehicle even taller. I would recommend going with a 2"" lift for now as you won't have to lift the body or screw with the steering shaft.  And if you have the opportunity, find someone with a set of 28s they'd let you borrow and throw them on for a weekend so you can get an idea of if that's what you really want."
battlewagon,2gblk7,Cyfun06,2,Sun Sep 14 00:56:01 2014 UTC,"I hear that. Definitely going for the lift.  Someday I'll get the 4"" or 6"" when I have another vehicle to drive and have plenty of money and time, but for now 2"" will do good. :) It's a lot less work. :p  If I was getting a lot bigger tires I would worry more about the gearing, but really they aren't too much bigger than mine are now thankfully. I thing I'll be okay. :p"

battlewagon,2gbf2s,THEMCV,2,Sat Sep 13 20:54:55 2014 UTC,Thanks! I really wish I had something to show the scale. The bottom of my door was waist high. I had to jump just to get in lol

We've had a good turn out thus far, mostly Bajas and Imprezas with a couple Outbacks and Foresters sprinkled in.  We expect our year-end build to include the XV (which is in our shop right now). :-)"
battlewagon,2g9kr0,Evoraist,2,Sat Sep 13 04:51:24 2014 UTC,Got my spacers earlier this year. Can't wait to get my bar.
battlewagon,2g9kr0,mynameisalso,2,Sat Sep 13 05:08:56 2014 UTC,Not to be a dick but that looks like my atv winch.  Any specs?
battlewagon,2g9kr0,NeilOMalley,0,Sat Sep 13 08:30:30 2014 UTC,Its definitely a small atv Harbor Freight Superwinch.  Not really good for anything but looks.
battlewagon,2g9kr0,mynameisalso,2,Sat Sep 13 10:28:18 2014 UTC,"It is a name brand,  superwinch.   It is a good winch just wondered if sized appropriatly"
battlewagon,2g9kr0,mynameisalso,5,Sat Sep 13 10:50:09 2014 UTC,"I've had extensive talks with Superwinch (very good company) and in short, the Terra45 is more than capable of safely handling 5,500lbs.  Which, if you consider two main points, its plenty: a.) You should have a winch that is rated 1.5 times the weight of your vehicle.  So for a 3,500 lbs vehicle 5,500 lbs is plenty, even with extra gear in the car. I'd rather burn the clutch in my winch then have it ripped out of my car. b.) If you incorporate a snatch block into you line/pull, you double the capacity of your winch - so I am more than confident this is plenty.  I've recovered Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, and a Subaru Outback as well as a Bobcat - its done its job quite well."
battlewagon,2g9kr0,mynameisalso,3,Sat Sep 13 15:50:38 2014 UTC,That big awd wagon only weighs 3500# that is impressive.   I wasn't condemning you just asking.

battlewagon,2g9kr0,forty2skates,2,Sat Sep 13 16:06:41 2014 UTC,Really though that thing hits the scales at 3500#?
battlewagon,2g9kr0,mynameisalso,2,Sat Sep 13 16:10:50 2014 UTC,"Yep - the GVWR is 4435 with a noted 900 lbs of maximum additional weight.  So translates to a GVW of 3535 lbs.  Aluminum block, hood and tailgate help alot.  :-)"
battlewagon,2g9kr0,Cyfun06,2,Sat Sep 13 19:22:27 2014 UTC,Gvw on your stickers and paperwork isnt actually what it weighs.  My trucks says 5500 and it is a four door 4wd diesel.  When I hit the scales it is close to 8000# I would bet anything if you hit the scales you would find yourself close to the 4000# range.   The winch wiring lights fuel in the tank oil coolant it all adds up. I am not trying to be a dick but you should really hit the scales you might be surprised.
battlewagon,2g9kr0,THEMCV,2,Sat Sep 13 19:45:24 2014 UTC,I've got some portable scales - I'll dig them out one of these days and take a look.
battlewagon,2g9kr0,SpringerTheNerd,1 point,Sat Sep 13 22:19:22 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure it's a Terra 45, 4500lb capacity ATV winch. Not quite enough for a 3400lb car unless you are only planning utility use and not actual rescue. Seems a little short sighted either way."
battlewagon,2g7pf4,Cyfun06,5,Fri Sep 12 16:43:45 2014 UTC,"And yes, I'm well aware it's not a wagon, but considering they offroad the Legacy so hard that they catch air, drive through a fence, and blow a tire while hopping a curb... and the fact that Subaru was cool enough to pay for it all... seems rather fitting for this sub.  Plus there's the whole driving-a-68-charger-at-the-subaru-rally-school thing."

battlewagon,2g93v1,Trejio,3,Sat Sep 13 01:02:28 2014 UTC,"Unless you want to do major transmission surgery, you're stuck with the gears you've already got.  I can't remember if those had a 3.9:1 or 4.11:1 ratio.  If you do want to go to the trouble to swap gears, you'd probably wanna steal Forester gears,as I believe they had a 4.444:1 ratio.  Honestly, though, you can probably live with 3.9.  As far as a lift goes, those leggies had a 24"" tire stock.  As they're only 2"" more in radius, at most you'd only need 2"" of lift, which can probably be accomplished with strut blocks/forester struts and no body lift.  You could probably just slap some 28s on there and see how bad it rubs, and go from there.  If you haven't already, go check out the USMB, as I can guarantee you someone on there has already done this and can give you an idea of what you're in for."

battlewagon,2g63zi,alitales,8,Fri Sep 12 03:36:15 2014 UTC,"As these are one-wheel drive, and pretty badly lacking in the ground clearance department, about all you can hope to accomplish is the battlewagon look, and none of the practical applications.  However, the point of a battlewagon is to be a vehicle you're comfortable abusing.  And to be honest, I think it'd be funny as fuck to see an HHR with tube bumpers, steelies and chunky tires.  So if you consider this thing to be too beat up to be a nice car anymore, that alone may define it as a bw.  But in my opinion, it really doesn't look that bad, and that thing has half the mileage of my cars.  You might be able to throw on some slightly larger tires, but I don't think you have a helluva lot of room to do so.  The stock tire size is 215/55R16, which is about 25.3 inches in diameter. You might be able to squeeze a 27 inch tire on there, but it will be hard to find tires in that size on a 16"" rim.  From what I've researched, your lug pattern is 5x110, which isn't shared with many other cars.  However, there were some Malibus and Saturns with that pattern that had 15"" rims, so you might try and find some of those.  As far as lifts go, my googling found jack shit.  So your best bet would probably be to tear the suspension apart yourself and see how hard it would be to shim the struts.  But bear in mind that no matter what you do, this thing's still gonna suck offroad, and any changes you do will mostly be cosmetic.  If you really want something for offroading, better off selling this and getting something you don't have to modify so heavily."
battlewagon,2g63zi,Cyfun06,2,Fri Sep 12 17:02:54 2014 UTC,"yep, 5x110. A 27"" tire would be 215/65/16 or 205/75/15 which the General Grabber AT2 is available in both sizes. I think the mid 00s Chevy Malibu had 15"" 5x110 steel wheels in a similar offset."

When it comes to offroading, about all you need to do is do strut and body lifts, and then maybe bumpers and skid places.  Also, $4k seems ludicrously high, especially without tires.  These cars are extremely easy to change axles on, and the axles are like $60 at a local parts store.  And the diff bushings are just chunks of rubber.  You literally remove and install them with a hammer.  Either way, that price is probably more than the car is worth.

battlewagon,2fzy7p,Rosterdog,2,Wed Sep 10 12:01:41 2014 UTC,"If i were you, I would go with a ej22 impreza wagon. Don't have to worry about the head gasket which is a big deal, and it will get the best gas mileage. It won't have the stock ground clearance of the forester or the outback but you can put forester or outback suspension on it pretty easily. As far as out of the box off road ability the forester would be the best choice but depending on the year you are looking at, I would worry about the head gaskets."
battlewagon,2fzy7p,shotgun_willie_P,2,Wed Sep 10 13:04:44 2014 UTC,"foresters and imprezas are based of the same chassis, I prefer the impreza because it feels a little more sporty and generally looks better stock (it dosnt take much to make a badass looking forester). outbacks dont get the greatest in town mileage  not that any subaru does.  as far as years go, newer is better IMO along with the lowest mileage possible.  but if you can find a 2.2L impreza thats the best idea, the head gaskets arnt a problem and I think they are non interference but dont quote me on it."
battlewagon,2fzy7p,whatnoreally,2,Wed Sep 10 13:36:01 2014 UTC,"The Subarus made between 1996 and 2001, namely the 2.5 liter engines, suffered from a lot of head gasket problems.  You could probably find an outback with a bad HG for $500 and replace the headgasket cheaply if you're mechanically inclined.  The EJ22 is the sought after engine. Between 1989 and 1995 was the SOHC version, which had slightly less power, but most of us prefer it because it's a non-interference engine, so you can drive it until your timing belt gives and not destroy your engine.  From 1996+ was when they made the DOHC version which was interference, and was a decent engine, but for most of us, the small increase in power doesn't justify the decrease in maintenance requirements and reliability.  Also, the DOHC versions are harder to find.  If you're on a budget, I'd suggest a Legacy made between 1989 and 1995 with the SOHC 2.2, as they're dirt cheap and really easy to lift.  IMHO, they cheaper ones make better battlewagons simply because you're less afraid to beat them up, and are less hesitant to throw tube bumpers and skid plates on.  The Impreza 2.2l wagons are amazing cars... if you can find one.  But the leggies are cheap and plentiful."

battlewagon,2fzy7p,apollo_2000,1 point,Wed Sep 10 13:04:38 2014 UTC,"As others have posted, a 96 Impreza with a SOHC 2.2L non-interference motor will be more-or-less bulletproof as you can drive it till the belt snaps and not worry about damaging pistons or valves. However, depending on where you're located, finding a nearly 20 year old Impreza in decent condition will be very extremely difficult. Both the rear quarter panels and rocker panels are extremely prone to rust, just look at any Impreza/Legacy of those years in a parking lot and you will almost always find rusty quarter panels where the quarter meets the rear bumper. If you can find one with minimal rust on the rockers, and your plan is to go the ""battle wagon"" route, it is cheap and easy to pick up a set of ZG flares (jdmflares.com) and cut your quarters/front fenders, re-weld them, then seal them, no worries about rust after that. Then you can fit some nice meaty tires and not worry about rust while enjoying an otherwise solid vehicle.   Basically, any Impreza before 2008 (GC/GF and GD/GG chassis) will have suspension components interchangeable with the first two generations of the Forester. The rear upper mounts are slightly different which is easily addressed by swapping out the strut upper mount, or redrilling your strut towers in conjunction with ""saggy butt spacers"""
battlewagon,2fz8d3,iminyourtoaster,3,Wed Sep 10 04:42:31 2014 UTC,"If the body's in good shape, might be worth it.  However, that has the sought-after fuel injected engine, but bad transmission. For offroading you want the dual range 5-speed.  Do you have any mechanically-inclined friends who could look at it and give you an idea of if it's a catastrophic problem, or just loose exhaust pipes?  Maybe you could take a video and post it here. :D  But to answer your question: yes, these engines are tough to find.  You're better off rebuilding the one you've got.  On the upside, they're one of the easiest engines in the world to work on.  But since you also want a dual range trans, you might check local junkyards for both an engine and trans.  Also, this could possibly be a good candidate for an EJ22 swap.  But if the engine is indeed toast, I wouldn't spend more than $300 on the car."

I agree with the writer that it's sort of a footnote when you consider that the big problems like tire wear still account for most offroad hiccups.

Sadly they're quite rare. You could feasibly do a diesel swap from a fwd passat, as they were all longitudinal mount.   I've seen cars where they modify the floor pan, buy euro spec axles, and transmission to make a 4motion Mk4 wagon as well. I believe you also have to use the longitudinal passat engines for this. nevermind it's a haldex system in the mk4's, so it's transverse.   Edit 2: in the end I'd rather have the b5 passat because it still has torsen and not haldex.   Edit: for the mk4 they used the rear axle and independent suspension out of an r32, because you can't use the semi independent shit that's in the stock wagon.

I don't think there's enough distinction between the two, I mean subaru calls the WRX a hatchback, but they're all over battlewagons. So like as long as it isn't an SUV, has 4 doors, 4WD, and a tailgate, it's good here right? Gray area would be...range rover evoque?"

Foresters are more what that's added for, but things like XJs are allowed to post as well. :) Anything bigger than those are in my opinion too big to be a wagon.   There are definitely the occasional exceptions that I'll make, but I would say the Evoque is too big to be posted here unless it was out doing off-road things. Then I would allow it. :)"

Started swinging around and wrapped around the brake line. Messed up the tie rod ends and some other stuff I have to get to.  Had to walk out of this pit I drove in to, about 1500 feet in 3/4s of a mile or something. Really steep.   Came back, removed the part attached to the wheel, drove it out in 2wd. Made it about 15 miles to where it'd be ok to tow it. ie out of the middle of nowhere and into the boonies. The camber is messed up and the brake line needs to be replaced.   Winter project."

battlewagon,2ftkya,THEMCV,6,Mon Sep 8 17:20:30 2014 UTC,"why would it mess it up? It's just a long intake...  however this one appears to be upside down, looks like rain will just go right in it."
battlewagon,2ftkya,applehat,2,Mon Sep 8 17:23:26 2014 UTC,"I thought this would mess with the MAF since everything is tuned for the front intake and also since it would be facing backwards for a N/A engine, wouldn't that not let it breathe?  I'm legitimately asking. :)"
battlewagon,2ftkya,THEMCV,5,Mon Sep 8 18:03:50 2014 UTC,"as long as the factory air box stays where its at, it wont effect anything.  CAI and the like mess it up because its changed the location and flow of the air past the MAF. Just adding more pipe up and out of the engine bay wont effect a thing."
battlewagon,2ftkya,applehat,1 point,Mon Sep 8 18:13:14 2014 UTC,"Maybe I'm a little confused on how these are run...  Don't you remove the front intake scoop and the  top of the snorkel is where the intake then would be? Like, the top point is now the intake, right? I feel like I'm way wrong."
battlewagon,2ftkya,MechMeister,5,Mon Sep 8 19:00:00 2014 UTC,"Right now, your intake system looks like this:  Weird Snorkus / Silencer Thing in the fender => Airbox => MAF => Engine  With a snorkel, you bascially just replace the Snorkus thing WITH the snorkel.   So, Snorkel running through fender => Airbox => Maf => Engine.  The snorkel runs into the airbox, and then you seal it... like this: http://www.subaruoutback.org/gallery/500/10201img_0070.jpg"

I thought that they messed with the MAF since you're changing the amount of air going in, but it would seem I'm wrong! :)  I really thought the intake being backwards would have caused problems with the engine breathing..."
battlewagon,2ftkya,Acidlips242,3,Mon Sep 8 19:50:09 2014 UTC,"Not at all. Engines suck the air, its not pushed in (unless forced induction is being used).  The little front intake scoop thing is just to get cooler air... There is no forcing of sit with it."
battlewagon,2ftkya,ItsPrimetime,1 point,Mon Sep 8 20:25:52 2014 UTC,"no, the length of the tube doesn't matter. you can put the inlet and filter anywhere you want to as long as water doesn't get in. all engine sensors are behind the filter and shouldn't need to be touched."
battlewagon,2ftkya,applehat,1 point,Mon Sep 8 18:36:13 2014 UTC,I guess my main concern is it facing the opposite direction that the intake would normally be would cause the engine to not get as much air as it needs. Am I super wrong on that?
battlewagon,2ftkya,ItsPrimetime,1 point,Mon Sep 8 19:02:03 2014 UTC,Nah. It should be able to get adequate airflow unless you put the filter/end of the tube in a sealed box or other container with limited flow. Or in an area around the vehicle which generates a semi-vacuum
battlewagon,2ftkya,THEMCV,3,Mon Sep 8 19:21:32 2014 UTC,"Your car doesn't have a MAF. It uses a MAP or Manifold Air Pressure sensor. It doesn't detect air flow, but it detects the air pressure, and the air temperature to calculate the volume of air entering the engine. MAPs are a lot harder to fool, which for us, is good.

battlewagon,2fpmwq,whatnoreally,5,Sun Sep 7 20:06:16 2014 UTC,"whatnoreally has a pretty accurate estimate.  You will also need to factor in a lift kit, which runs around 700-900 for a 6"" depending on who you buy it from.  You could build one yourself if you have the proper tools and know how. You will not get enough lift with struts alone. Kevin (on the right) also has tons of time in his rig with small custom parts and tweaks."

Little as 100 if you do it all yourself   From here on out it depends on how well you weld. You need to extend your steering shaft shifter, and sometimes brake lines. Most of the lift kit can be custom fabbed, I wouldn't fuck with the strut tower lifts. Also radiator hoses need to be extended. Not gonna include tires on the price because I'm going with used for onroad and tractor tires offroad. Any questions hit me up on ultimate subaru, my username is comatosellama.

battlewagon,2frh07,THEMCV,3,Mon Sep 8 02:22:20 2014 UTC,Exactly i got it because I needed something better on gas and I wanted something smaller to fit on trails better.

I wanted to get a little bit more extreme with my off road build since I no longer needed the forester as a DD.   I loved the forester and it was a great car on  and off road but the 4wd low, solid rear axle, greater clearance, and stronger aftermarket made the 4runner a better choice for an offroad/camping vehicle.

While they hunted I went exploring on the offroad trails that snake all over the forest surrounding the lake and I honestly couldn't believe how capable this car was off-road. I know that it's nowhere near as capable as a rock crawler, but for what it is it put up a damn good fight on these trails.  I will be uploading some of the raw footage for those that are interested from the two different days I took it out on the trails. There's going to spots where I stop to look at maps, take pictures,. etc., but for the most part it's just me driving around. Don't expect anything glorious, haha, but I'll try at some point to put some annotations in the video so you can skip around to the better parts. (Or just wait til I have a chance to edit stuff down, but that could be a few days)  My favorite part of this week was coming down from the viewpoint on trail 818 and parking in the OHV staging area to check the tires and belly of the car before heading out onto the main road again. A older forest ranger saw me and drove over to see if I was alright and I told him I was fine, just doing a trip check on my way back from the viewpoint. His response was: ""You took THAT thing up there!?!? Are you fuckin nuts!?!?"" I couldn't help but crack up laughing right in front of him! :D  I know that this may be a selfish request or ploy for karma, but I'd appreciate the upvotes so those that have question about my car can find it here in this post. I feel like I'm answering a lot of questions I've gotten before.. now the answers are going to be all in one place! and it includes video! :D  Take a drive with me:  1) Trail 10 (4minutes) www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb7HZkxLHLI  To sum up this week in a few words: Dust, Rocks, Exploring, Deschutes Brewery, Confused Rangers! :D  About my wagon:   1990 Subaru Legacy 2.5 bottom end with 2.2 heads (high compression 2.5) Outback Struts with stock Legacy springs 27.5"" BFG All-Terrains Total lift comes to just under 3"" Average MPG 26mpg (highway 28-30) Paint: Ford Oxford White, Rustoleum Spray on Bedliner (Moderately happen with the quality, but will probably do Dupicolor Spray on Bedliner if I redo it)   My observations about the BFG All-Terrains:   Surprisingly very little road noise Good grip on and off-road (So far I've been in sand, dirt, mud, on rocks, pavement, over small obstacles like sticks/logs, loose gravel and round and jagged rocks and have had very little issue with grip or traction) Softer side walls can be a bit worrisome on sharp rocks and harsh terrain (I've heard of people puncturing the side walls on shale) The awesome white lettering is a plus in my book. It's arbitrary to the performance, but my car's gotten quite a bit of positive attention because of it. I think it adds character. From what I've heard they have great wear life. Some people have even told me that they've put over 70k on theirs. I'm interested to see how mine will fair. So far 2k+ miles and counting (It's my daily driver/camping rig so it'll probably see mostly pavement wear) ~Overall impression: I really like them! They are quite capable of keeping up with what I'm putting them through and they have a good reputation that I now can appreciate after putting them through their paces on this last trip!"

battlewagon,2fbiw1,aOrmsby,6,Wed Sep 3 02:23:41 2014 UTC,"As with any used car, I'd suggest having it looked at by a reputable mechanic. Main concerns at that age (if you don't mind rust and the potential for a leak) is the motor. Seals and gaskets are getting to be old, and you don't know how it's been maintained. That said, 300,000 isn't extraordinarily high for a Japanese four-cylinder from that era. Still has the OE wheels, which can be a good sign. If you don't mind the usual maintenance, and she gets a clean bill of health from your mechanic, they can be great cars.  Hopefully /u/cyfun06 or /u/NeilOMalley can chime in. I think they know a bit more about that era than I do."
battlewagon,2fbiw1,teamwrk,6,Wed Sep 3 02:49:54 2014 UTC,"So kind of you to reference me! :D  Honestly, as I'm guessing ""dirt cheap"" means a couple hundred bucks, probably not worth spending an extra $100 to take it to a mechanic.  The last few years of the Loyale/GL were excellent cars as they often had the 1.8 MPFI engine.  On the downside, most of the newer models came with push-button 4x4 instead of dual range.  If it's already a stick shift, you could find a dual range trans at a junk yard for roughly $200, and the swap is really easy.  If it's an automatic, they were somewhat shitty transmissions, but if you could find a full parts car to steal clutch parts and the dual range trans from, it might be worth it.  You could totally live with a single range 4x4 trans, but if you plan on lifting it at all, you will want the low range.  As far as ""massive problems"" go for that car, there really aren't any.  You're already aware of the rust.  And if the engine seems to have decent power and isn't emitting any particularly scary noises, then I wouldn't worry.  Even if it only lasts another 10k miles, for a few hundred bucks, you really can't go wrong.  And even if your head gasket does happen to blow after a week, these are one of the easiest and cheapest cars to work on. Dunno if you're very mechanically inclined, but a HG job is about $40 in parts and weekend's labor, and these are good cars to learn on.  Or... that's a good time to do an EJ22 swap. :D"

battlewagon,2f0uwb,ItsPrimetime,1 point,Mon Sep 1 17:27:44 2014 UTC,"When one tire loses reaction doesn't all power (torque?) go to that free spinning wheel? Or, perhaps, does only one half of the power go there since there is also a differential between the front and rear wheels?    I wish I knew more about cars :/ my current knowledge is a limited slip differential limits the amount of power that is wasted to a traction-less wheel, but an open differential would put all the power into that free-spinning wheel instead. Is that correct?"
battlewagon,2f0uwb,Mcsquizzy,3,Mon Sep 1 20:28:01 2014 UTC,"It is correct, but when you have 2 drive axles, you get a much better chance at your tires finding enough grip to get you out of a situation."
battlewagon,2f0uwb,ItsPrimetime,1 point,Tue Sep 2 00:40:22 2014 UTC,"Sad day. Do other Subaru's with things like LSDs, DCCDs, and VDC make Subaru's the go-to snow daily driver?    Sorry for so many questions. I just feel like my barebones outback isn't like other Subaru's, and I kinda lost some peace of mind / pride in a way :/"
battlewagon,2f0uwb,Mcsquizzy,2,Tue Sep 2 01:20:31 2014 UTC,"Most subarus don't use limited slip differentials. It was only the upper trim of the older subarus that had them.  What makes your subaru good in the snow is the same that makes every subaru good in the snow. The LSD only makes a large difference on an AWD car during spirited driving, or super-shitty conditions.   The STI with the DCCD also has 2 mechanical LSDs, you can't get any better than that. The car that I pulled my LSD from was equipped with VDC, subaru's early traction control.  Every subaru takes on the snow a little differently, but it's not the high-trimmed subaru's that made the brand's name. It's the design they put into every one of their cars that built their reputation."
battlewagon,2f0uwb,ItsPrimetime,1 point,Tue Sep 2 01:36:40 2014 UTC,Ahh... I was think all the newer models had the fancier features. That is much more comforting.    Did you say you took a limited slip from another car and put it in yours?
battlewagon,2f0uwb,Mcsquizzy,1 point,Tue Sep 2 02:53:08 2014 UTC,I took the LSD from a 2001 outback H6 and put it in my 1998 Legacy GT 5spd
battlewagon,2f0uwb,ItsPrimetime,1 point,Tue Sep 2 02:59:27 2014 UTC,"/u/ItsPrimetime nailed it. None of the extra stuff is what got Subaru their rep. It's what their base cars offered, which was full time AWD on all of their models. That's the beauty. You don't have to spend a ton of money on an upscale version of a car to get a fantastic AWD system and an awesome car. :)"
battlewagon,2f0uwb,Mcsquizzy,1 point,Tue Sep 2 03:41:15 2014 UTC,"Subaru's AWD system is supposed to send more power to the side (front/back) that isn't slipping, so if your rear wheels are in something, it'll transfer power out to the front wheels more to get you out. :)  And you are correct about how an LSD is supposed to work. :)  If you put your Outback into ""1"" or ""2"" it should soft lock the center differential to 50/50 power split, which will keep the front and rears going at about the same speed. There's a mod that you can do that will lock it 50/50 found here."
battlewagon,2f0uwb,Mcsquizzy,1 point,Tue Sep 2 03:33:53 2014 UTC,":o that's all awesome to hear. Questions.    So even without LSDs, the power is still counterintuitive? I remember playing with Lego diff's as a kid, and the power would always send to the free wheel. Granted, those are plastic toys and these are subarus, but isn't the concept the same? What about the Subaru design puts power to the wheels with traction, if it isn't the limited slip technology of the diffs?    I want to learn as much as possible about my car :P"
battlewagon,2f0uwb,Mcsquizzy,1 point,Tue Sep 2 04:02:39 2014 UTC,"I'm not exactly sure on the details of it and I may be wrong on some of this, so feel free to fact check me, but I believe the Duty (C?) solenoid in the transmission is what determines the power split for the car depending on the weather conditions. It's what controls the front to rear power. So when you have a rear right wheel slipping, the system is supposed to put more power towards the front of the car, and in return taking power away from the spinning wheel. :)   Edit: I checked and I was correct on this. The Duty C Solenoid is actually involved with the 50/50 mod. It's what determines the power split. :)"
battlewagon,2f0uwb,RogerGoiano,1 point,Tue Sep 2 04:23:30 2014 UTC,"I really do appreciate the explanations :) I don't have anyone with a Subaru to ask 'in depth' questions. In the mod link, the author tests the AWD by turning in a circle, and talks about tension and such. Is there a problem with turning a tight circle in AWD? Can it cause damage?"
battlewagon,2f0uwb,teamwrk,1 point,Tue Sep 2 04:38:20 2014 UTC,"I hear you. Feel free to shoot me a PM anytime if you ever need anything or have a question. :)  With the mod enabled (and check my other previous comment for a link that has pictures and better explanations) it makes the front and rear drive-shafts turn at the same speed, which causes the car to hop and have tension in turning.   Here's a NASIOC thread on it (sort of)  Basically, it's fine to turn a tight circle in your car to just turn it in normal driving, but it can be/is extremely hard on your car if you're doing drifts or dounts on dry pavement (which I'm not sure we could anyways :p.) Just be careful with your power steering pump as well if you're doing winter drifts or anything like that. :)"
battlewagon,2f0uwb,teamwrk,1 point,Tue Sep 2 04:49:47 2014 UTC,"Holy shit! That link is awesome! I had heard about the 90/10 split and was very disappointed, but (and as busted in the article) I just assumed the 'AWD' would change continuously. I never really thought about the time it takes to kick in. Will for sure use that mod. Thanks a ton!"
battlewagon,2f0uwb,minizanz,1 point,Tue Sep 2 04:10:10 2014 UTC,"No problem. :)   Yeah like I said, your car will move power around, but I with that you can leave it at its most effective position. That way the front wheels will spin the same rate as the rear wheels. To clarify, this doesn't mean all four wheels will spin at the exact same speed. Basically if you have a right rear wheel that is on a slippery surface and you have your front tires on dry pavement, but have this on, the right rear wheel shouldn't slip.   Like I said also, fact check me to be sure. I'm 99% sure I'm remembering all of this right including my other comment, but diving into it a bit more wouldn't hurt just in case I'm remembering this stuff wrong. :)   edit: This website explains it a lot better!"

battlewagon,2f0uwb,whatnoreally,2,Sat Aug 30 19:02:03 2014 UTC,"In conclusion....  VDC On:   In the first test, it was nice and steady climbing the hill. The second time up took a little bit of effort, but it made it fine. Third time struggled a bit as well, but it did make it. All in all, the VDC made it every time.  VDC Off:  The first time (and that was before we even got it really muddy) it got stuck trying to climb. Lots of wheel spin, but not a lot of moving. I had to back down and go at it again, but it did better the second time. The third time definitely was the best for the VDC Off group as it has almost no problems.  I guess it's take this as you will. I still haven't come to a definitive answer as to whether VDC is better for off-roading.   For solid ground, I would leave it on. For super muddy stuff, I would leave it off. In this stuff? I really don't know.  edit: Sorry, I forgot to make this the first comment."
battlewagon,2f0uwb,b-hop,2,Sat Aug 30 19:20:13 2014 UTC,"Damn. What's the consistency of what you're driving through in the video? Looks like dirt until you break past the surface and then it's just slick as snot. Would live to see more tests in different surface types!  How do you did/enable VDC? Button press?  Also, re: today's lesson... When in doubt, flat out?"
battlewagon,2f0uwb,dmanww,2,Sat Aug 30 19:57:46 2014 UTC,"That was about it. :p In the first VDC Off test was when we were actually breaking the dirt and getting it muddy, but that was the one I had the most trouble on. Odd.   Yep, 2002+ has a button that turns it off, but comes back on after ~35MPH.  Pretty much. With the VDC, it seems that you just need to go all the way down so the VDC doesn't cut too much and make the tires stop spinning. It seems if you give it enough gas, it'll control the wheel spin a lot better and keep all four wheels going rather than letting two spin while the others are idle."
battlewagon,2f0uwb,injulen,5,Sat Aug 30 20:05:17 2014 UTC,"Alright, so I did a brief bit of reading. I didn't realize VDC is a form of stability management, but that would explain the seemingly inconsistent results in your test. It uses multiple systems, but is mostly intended for yaw, so it could perform inconsistently in off road terrain where the system is getting unexpected response to the adjustments it is making."
battlewagon,2f0uwb,minizanz,2,Sat Aug 30 23:18:00 2014 UTC,"That may be it. Yeah, it uses steering angle sensors, yaw sensors, wheel spin sensors, body roll sensors... lots of sensors. I'm still not sure though, because on the VDC Off tests, there were times when wheels weren't spinning, but on the VDC On test they seemed to always be going... Ah this is a confusing system. I wish this older system was better documented. :("
battlewagon,2f0uwb,minizanz,2,Sat Aug 30 23:56:29 2014 UTC,"since you have a torsen rear and active VTD center chunk you are only getting stability control from VDC.  that means all it does is cut the power output.  on the newer cars it drags the breaks to simulate having limited slip diffs/center chunk, and that is useful since all current subis other than the sti have all open diffs."
battlewagon,2eygdi,DionysusDerp,5,Fri Aug 29 21:59:44 2014 UTC,"Just send you the springs! It's usually recommended to put them on new shocks for the best ride. KYB GR-2s are most commonly used as replacements.   Once you get them, it's a matter of getting the springs on the shock, which unless you feel comfortable doing that (it can be dangerous if you're not careful) you can just take it to a shop and have them put them on your shocks. :)  I hope this helps! :)"
battlewagon,2eygdi,THEMCV,3,Fri Aug 29 22:18:28 2014 UTC,"Correct. All OP needs from King is a set of springs. Reuse your OE tophats. As suggested, you'll want to consider new struts too, and I would suggest something that offers more bump and rebound stiffness to accommodate the new ride height. Less compression on the strut means it will offer less resistance than stock ride height.  If you're doing springs and strut spacers, you may need some additional components like adjustable trailing arm brackets. Also, an alignment when you're done.  As for did/assembly. You can rent a set of spring compression clamps from your local auto parts store. Usually free, but there's a deposit in case you decide to keep them.  Be very careful when torquing down the top but onto the strut shaft- if you strip it, you're gonna have a bad time. Same goes for removing them too."
battlewagon,2eygdi,teamwrk,3,Fri Aug 29 23:54:13 2014 UTC,"At ~1"", I don't know that adjustable trailing arm brackets are needed, but it's possible.

It costs $200 extra but it is actually cheaper than having a shop load them. I would recommend this shock/spring combination to anyone looking to lift their Forester."
battlewagon,2eygdi,musubk,2,Sat Aug 30 03:03:15 2014 UTC,Edit: I forgot to mention that this would be the case if you were ordering them from Primitive Racing.
battlewagon,2eygdi,musubk,1 point,Sat Aug 30 18:51:08 2014 UTC,"You just need the springs. For around $450-$500 from Primitive Racing (good helpful guys, I've dealt with them a couple of times and would go back) you can get the set of 4 springs + the rear strut spacers that get rid of the saggy butt and give a little more aggressive stance. It's pricey for a set of springs but they're very nice, handling improvement is phenomenal. They have 'stock length' which is good for almost an inch lift because they don't compress as much under the weight of your car as the softer factory springs, and they have a 'raised length' which I think is good for about 2 inches of lift. Primitive also sells subframe spacer kits that keep everything in alignment with the larger lift (not needed with the 'stock length'/inch lift). If I recall right they quoted me in the neighborhood of $750 for a complete 2 inch lift kit which had the King springs, strut spacers, and the subframe spacer kit. I went with the 'stock length' as what I was really looking for was better handling without losing ground clearance, not so much a big lift.  Install isn't hard but it takes a while and you'll probably be cussing in a few spots as you try to push parts around to get holes to line up. A spare jack or two is really helpful for that. The only special tools you need are spring compressors which Autozone/O'Reilly's will loan you for free.  Since you have an older car, I'd do new struts too while you're at it. And stiffer strut top hats while it's all apart, if you care about handling. I'm basically just not looking forward to taking it all apart again when I eventually add those two parts, wish I'd done it all at once."

battlewagon,2erf1z,Dandledorff,3,Wed Aug 27 21:04:53 2014 UTC,"Airbags, while good in theory, also stiffen your suspension by a lot.  The problem with this is that it utterly destroys what little articulation you have.  Now... if you could rig it up so you could control each corner individually, that might solve that problem.  Why not just have a fixed height?"
battlewagon,2erf1z,Cyfun06,1 point,Wed Aug 27 22:52:09 2014 UTC,"I'm thinking there would be a way to regulate pressure so that the system isn't fully inflated when activated which would give it some give I would want for offroad, the lowering would be for highway commutes (better mpg),  normal ride height for city and lifted for offroad. Each corner would be cool for rock crawling to get rid of teetering. Fixed height is a solution to offroad or highway but sometimes you wanna do both. Ideally you'd have road wheels to get to the offroading trails switch to the offroading wheels there that way you get the most bang for your buck."
battlewagon,2erf1z,ImTheFatMan,4,Wed Aug 27 23:28:56 2014 UTC,Ride height has about as much affect on your gas mileage as the weight of your paint does.
battlewagon,2erf1z,ImTheFatMan,1 point,Thu Aug 28 01:01:20 2014 UTC,A taller box has more air resistance than a shorter box going down a road so yes height is important for mpg in simplest terms. Look at a ford f-150 stock ride height gets about 20-22 when you lift it you're lucky to get 16-18.
battlewagon,2erf1z,FesteringNeonDistrac,2,Thu Aug 28 11:29:03 2014 UTC,"But you aren't making the box taller. You're just placing it higher. It'll have a slight effect since some tire becomes frontal surface area, but that's it. When you lift something like this, most efficiency losses come with the larger and heavier wheels/tires, not the air resistance."

battlewagon,2enpz5,DrCockenstein,10,Tue Aug 26 20:07:33 2014 UTC,"For that money you could find a beat up 89-95 Legacy with an EJ22 and part-time AWD.  But if you're on a budget, I would recommend an EA82, preferably one of the later GLs or Loyales with the MPFI 1.8 liter, and the high-low 4x4 manual trans.  The the push-button 4x4 on the automatics and later manuals lacks low range, so avoid that if possible.  And the 1.8s were fantastic engines, so even if you found one with 200k miles, it would still last you a good long time.  And in the event that the engine does eventually go, then it's a prime candidate for an EJ22 swap.  Legacys are decent cars too, as they're a bit more roomy and more comfortable, but the AWD just isn't as good as the 4x4 offroad.  Honestly, if you're mostly gonna use it as a daily driver with the occasional snow or dirt road driving, get a Leggy, but if you plan on doing any actual offroading on sand or mud or jeep trails, go for an EA82.  If you only wanna lift it two inches, you can easily accomplish that on an EA82 with strut blocks, no body lifting required.  And with a 2 inch lift, you can squeeze in 27 inch tires, or 28s with some fender trimming. Don't wanna go much higher than that, though, because it will gear you too tall and you'll lose power.  To answer your question about common problems, there really aren't that many.  If there's rust, you'll see it.  If the engine sounds bad, you'll hear it or feel a loss of power. Just like any car, check the coolant, oil, and trans fluids, look for milky oil that might indicate a head gasket issue, and see if the trans fluid is clean (most people never change their trans fluid).  About the only thing to avoid like the plague is the 96+ models with the 2.5 liter, as anything in your price range will need a head gasket in the near future.  However, if you're mechanically inclined, you can pick up an Outback with a bad head gasket for $500 and fix it yourself."

battlewagon,2enpz5,whiskeyfordinner,5,Wed Aug 27 04:17:19 2014 UTC,"Subaru cars are great. Just don't make the mistake I did and buy a 97-98 car with a DOHC engine. Go SOHC and they are mostly bullet proof. You can lift them 2"" easily but don't go too extreme as the AWD driveline will have issues with binding, slipping, and unusual differential wear.   As for 4wd vs AWD I would go AWD as it is great in the rain, ice, and snow. 4wd doesn't gain traction as well as the symmetrical AWD. Also 4wd maxes out at a certain mph."
battlewagon,2enpz5,whiskeyfordinner,2,Tue Aug 26 22:12:16 2014 UTC,Any year in particular for SOHC and AWD? Thanks for the advice.
battlewagon,2enpz5,Cyfun06,2,Tue Aug 26 22:16:54 2014 UTC,"96+ really. The beauty of these cars is they are mostly modular. My 98 I am going to lift soon using 05 Forrester struts and springs then use adjustable rear trailing arms from a WRX to get my spacing right. In the end my car should lift 1.5-2 inches allowing me to run some decent sized tires (probably 16"" rims because I have a spare set off of a 01 Outback)."
battlewagon,2enpz5,DukeSpraynard,0,Tue Aug 26 22:26:36 2014 UTC,"I think you have it backwards. The SOHC EJ22 was in 1989-1995 cars. From 96 onward is when they started using the DOHC EJ22, which was a decent engine, but not as reliable as it was an interference engine.  And of course after 96 we also have the EJ25D, which was notorious for head gasket issues.  OP, if you're gonna get an EJ car, you probably want something made between 1989 and 1995."
battlewagon,2enpz5,teamwrk,2,Tue Aug 26 23:56:37 2014 UTC,I looked it up and EJ is 89-95. I have experience with VW engines so a flat four is right up my ally.

The 1989 Legacy used an EJ, and the 2015 STI is still using an EJ motor. You have to be a bit more specific if you want to get good information for your research. EJ18, EJ20, EJ22, EJ25, EJ201, EJ20G, EJ22E, EJ22T, EJ25D, EJ251, EJ253, EJ255, EJ257, plus many others will hep to narrow down the individual characteristics."

battlewagon,2enpz5,chrwei,3,Wed Aug 27 05:51:58 2014 UTC,"EA can refer to the motor itself, or as shorthand for the entire platform of models. Drivetrains were available as FWD, 4WD, Dual-Range FWD, or Full-Time 4WD (Subaru's first generation of AWD with either on open center diff or a manually-locking center). Body styles included wagon, sedan, hatchback, 3-door coupe, BRAT, and XT. Most engine, drivetrain, suspension, and interior parts are directly swappable among the models with zero or minimal modification. XT, BRAT, and hatchback are generally more specific with their parts demands.   EA is the older 8-valve non-interference engine family. Most cars from the 1980s had either an EA81 or EA82, both are 1.8 liters displacement.   EA81 is the older design. They are OHV engines with a gear-driven camshaft and no timing belts/chain. Most you will find are carbureted, but some came from the factory with Subaru's first generation of turbocharging.   EA82 is mostly mid-to-late 1980s. SOHC with two timing belts (one for each side of the motor. Available with carb, SPFI (throttle-body injection), MPFI NA, and MPFI turbo."
battlewagon,2enpz5,teamwrk,1 point,Fri Aug 29 06:20:21 2014 UTC,"EA's are easy, cheap, and reliable as running engines. If you want to increase power reliably and affordably, an EJ-swap is highly recommended."

Mine on the other hand has a lot of random stuff but let's see what I can remember off the top of my head. Suspension: forester struts and springs up front, and XT struts and springs in the rear with GC tophats. 20mm sway, kartboy front and rear endlinks, diff locking bolt, diff bushings, tranny bushings, front and rear shifter bushings, short shifter, shifter extension. For the engine I have an m45 eaton supercharger setup and yeah thats all I can think of now."
battlewagon,2ejy85,ssschillings,3,Mon Aug 25 23:40:15 2014 UTC,"mind giving me a bit more info on your locking diff bolt? I have never looked into them too much. Is there an option to lock / unlock it without getting out of the car like newer modern ones, or is this a cheap mechanical part you have to get under the car and put in or take out to lock the differential?"
battlewagon,2ejy85,teamwrk,2,Tue Aug 26 02:22:01 2014 UTC,"No it doesn't affect the mechanics of the diff itself, it essentially bolts the diff to the subframe so that it is stiffer."
battlewagon,2ejy85,Decembermouse,3,Tue Aug 26 03:07:01 2014 UTC,"Yup 2.2 liter with 217k miles.  Why did I go for the supercharger? Well it was different and it was relatively cheap compared to doing a swap on the car. Plus I sure do live the whine from the supercharger. I plan on getting a smaller pulley so I can run more boost.  I honestly tried to go for the cheapest ones at the time. Majority of the bushings are kartboy. The tranny bushing is and Sti group N bushing. The sway definitely reduces body roll significantly. My car was actually on coilovers previously so i tried to do as many suspension upgrades for handling. Obviously they dont handle as well, but for having a three inch lift over stock I can still whip around corners pretty fast. The tranny bushing makes gear changes a lot ""stiffer"" i would say. The car just feels more mechanical all around I'm not really sure how to describe that."
battlewagon,2ejy85,NeilOMalley,2,Tue Aug 26 03:22:51 2014 UTC,"Right on! She looks good-- and familiar; I just realised I saw you on /r/Subaru like a year or more ago when it was lowered. Welcome to the community!  Re: forced induction.. I meant in terms of performance-- I've considered a supercharger because, in theory, it provides added power through the RPMS, rather than waiting for a turbo to spool. Though I bet the whine sounds nice!  No need to describe it-- I felt an immediate and noticeable difference going from the paperclip 12MM sway to the 19MM out of the RS, and can only imagine the set of endlinks and bushings will be noticeable as well."
battlewagon,2ejy85,sonnyclips,2,Tue Aug 26 04:11:35 2014 UTC,"|it provides added power through the RPMS, rather than waiting for a turbo to spool.  You're right about that. However, running a super, as I understand it, does use up more fuel, and since it's powered by your engine directly, it uses up some horsepower just in order to run as well. So if memory serves, those are the sacrifices compared to a turbo."
battlewagon,2ejy85,brzcory,1 point,Tue Aug 26 05:08:51 2014 UTC,"Yup you're completely right about that, superchargers are parasitic and will reduce hp to create hp, but I sure do love not having turbo lag."
battlewagon,2ejy85,agent42x,2,Tue Aug 26 14:38:17 2014 UTC,Its not a differential lock in the sense of offroad like a welded diff or air lockers.  Its a kit for stiffening the rear suspension by making the diff mount more solid aka locking it in place.  There is no such thing as locking rear diff for Subarus unfortunately.
battlewagon,2ejy85,bbdrmmrkd,1 point,Wed Aug 27 14:19:53 2014 UTC,You could run the e-brake cables to the driver's compartment independently and use them as manual lockers by installing a second e-brake handle I bet.

Sounds like it isn't as simple as on old Soobies, but you might just jack your car up, unbolt the strut mounts, and see how hard it would be to put spacers in there.  You probably wouldn't wanna go more than an inch or two, though, or else you're gonna strain your CVs joints.  But bear in mind that for every inch of lift, you can add twice that in tire diameter, so even if you can only get an inch out of strut blocks, you could gain two total.  Honestly, though, for the amount of work involved, it would probably be easier... and cheaper... to get a beat up $500 EA82 wagon.  Hell, a new set of tires for your car would be more expensive than that."

battlewagon,2ekhs9,Evoraist,2,Tue Aug 26 02:58:57 2014 UTC,"Depends on what 'winter' consists of in your climate. In the northern prairie states/ central Canada, where winter means hard-packed snow and sheet ice for months on end (mixed with -40 temps), you really can't mess around."

battlewagon,2eh2q4,that_kiwi_dude,16,Sun Aug 24 21:26:40 2014 UTC,"First off as a reminder for everybody: if you guys could make suggestion posts self-posts, that would be great! I'll leave this here since you've already got some comments already and are off road in the picture. :)  Now...  Here is my wagon currently.  There's a pretty good amount of stuff you can do for your wagon. :)  Starting with protection, Primitive makes excellent quality plates that will keep your car safe from rocks and branches from stabbing into your under-body driving or if you bottom out. I highly recommend Primitive. They're excellent to work with.   Let's talk about lifts, now! :) There's multiple ways to lift an Outback. Subtle Solutions and Gorilla Off-Road Company both make 1"" Spacers that allow you to lift without much (if any) correction to the suspension.   After lifting, getting an alignment is definitely recommended. Also note that 2"" is pretty much the max for lifting our cars unless you're wanting to getting into dropping the subframe. SJR makes a lift that goes 4"" and 6"", but they increase in price significantly from the 2"" model.  If you're looking for a lift that has some more on the road benefits, King Springs are another viable option as they have ~20% stiffer progressive spring rate that keeps the car stiffer on corners and keeps you from bouncing around off-road. They're usually put on new shocks and the most commonly used ones are KYB GR2s. There's a little discrepancy on how much they lift, but it's usually 1""-1.5"". The King Spring + KYB GR2 combo will run you ~$900, which is a little pricey, but worth it if you're looking for an improved ride.  One last route to go (which I think I'm going to do these and regular height King Springs) is an SJR lift which uses metal lifting blocks found here. They provide a 2"" lift and are angled to keep stock strut geometry which is definitely nice.  Lights are a place you can mix it up a bit. Hella 500s are tried and true and have a more ""rally"" look to them, but I recently bought this front LED light bar and absolutely love it. It's light output is ridiculous and it's great for the price. So far, no complaints. Just remember for bulb lights, circle lights generally put out more. :) Her's my top LED light bar as well if you're interested.  I got this roof rack and am very happy with it. It's solid and great for the money. They make an extension piece as well and a cargo net  Rally Armor Mud Flaps are useful for keeping the mud on your car down and also defecting rocks from your paint. :)  And last but not least, tires! I highly recommend General Grabber AT2s. You can go about one more tire size bigger than stock and still not rub. :) Tires are one of the best upgrades you can get for going off-road. :)  I hope this helps! :)"

battlewagon,2eh2q4,baccaruda66,6,Sun Aug 24 22:16:27 2014 UTC,I'd do the lift first because it makes room for larger tires if desired.
battlewagon,2eh2q4,bcvx,1 point,Mon Aug 25 01:05:44 2014 UTC,Depends on the planned lift. If strut spacer lift or longer/stiffer springs the bottom spring perch is the limiting factor for tires.
battlewagon,2eh2q4,baccaruda66,1 point,Mon Aug 25 06:20:39 2014 UTC,"True, but after lifting, the tire also ends up in a different location with respect to the framerails and fenders. What fits before the lift won't necessarily fit after the lift. I guess I'd include tires/wheels/wheel spacers all in the same area of items to address after the lift is installed.   I had to install 1"" wheel spacers to keep my car's larger tires from rubbing on the framerails, and with respect to your point about the bottom spring perch, I did have to mind the bottom spring perch height when I was choosing struts, even with the wheel spacers."
battlewagon,2eh2q4,bcvx,1 point,Tue Aug 26 01:59:23 2014 UTC,"hmmm, got to know to look out for that. Was the issue at the front or rear tire? If at the rear did you try a block at the (swing arm, or what ever it's called) to move the pivot point down?"
battlewagon,2eh2q4,baccaruda66,1 point,Tue Aug 26 02:11:19 2014 UTC,"That was at the front, while steering. The car   http://i.imgur.com/Tifog.jpg  has a full 4"" suspension/crossmember lift similar to this photo   http://i130.photobucket.com/albums/p241/87monster/100_0120.jpg  (prototype of the actual lift; the finished product has some drop blocks - pictured as separate - joined into 1-piece units)  with 1"" spacers on all 4 wheels; the front spacers are to address rubbing on the crossmember while the rear spacers are basically to provide the same track width in the rear as in the front."

battlewagon,2ef2mb,whitefeather14,1 point,Sun Aug 24 14:09:34 2014 UTC,What you could do is order a new top and trace that so you  don't have to pull the entire strut out until you are ready. A local dealership should be able to look up the right part with the Vin number.

If there is any play in the wheel when shaking at 12 or 6 o'clock positions, the bearing is bad and needs to be replaced. Play left or right is also a symptom of a bad wheel bearing.   If this is not the case, have the alignment checked at Firestone or similar. If the alignment is good, have your wheels balanced."

battlewagon,2e3sfa,SpringerTheNerd,1 point,Wed Aug 20 23:23:22 2014 UTC,"I got around 3/4 to an inch lift on a brand new car where the stock springs were still new. You can tell there's something more aggressive about the stance (I also have 1/4 inch spacers on the rear) but it's hard to pin down what until you park next to a stock one. The road handling, on pavement and off, is a major improvement from stock. You can always add some of the Primitive strut spacers to get more lift."
battlewagon,2e3sfa,aaronm007,1 point,Fri Aug 22 22:50:43 2014 UTC,How much lift in total did you get? I was thinking about doing the same for my 2010 outback but am skeptical about it because I don't want to go to high
battlewagon,2e3sfa,SpringerTheNerd,2,Wed Aug 20 21:42:27 2014 UTC,It lifted it like an inch and a half.
battlewagon,2e3sfa,SpringerTheNerd,2,Wed Aug 20 22:40:41 2014 UTC,"I got like 1.75"" of lift when I put king springs on my 98 Outback.  Definitely night and day difference!"

battlewagon,2e3sfa,tpm319,1 point,Wed Aug 20 23:11:03 2014 UTC,I like the sound of that! Did you also do the rear sway bar? I'm not sure if that's as big of an issue on your outback. On the 2010 it has a stupid amount of body role
battlewagon,2e3sfa,TheEthanolPatriarch,1 point,Wed Aug 20 23:12:51 2014 UTC,My car doesn't even have a rear sway bar which I didn't know until I was doing the suspension. I didn't notice that much body roll before the king springs and especially not with them.

I'm looking to take off some work to go camping sometime in the beginning of Sept and this looks like my kind of spot!   And NWWO? North West Washington Offroad? Are you part of the cool kids club?

battlewagon,2e1wp6,THEMCV,1 point,Wed Aug 20 09:32:00 2014 UTC,Just wondering how you wired in your light bar on the roof. Did you just drill a hole through the roof and run the wire through the roof space(removal of liner to fit) and down the a pillar into the engine bay? Then just silicone/sikaflex the hole or is there something better?
battlewagon,2e1wp6,THEMCV,2,Wed Aug 20 14:23:27 2014 UTC,"It actually isn't wired in yet! I'm going to drill (I think) into the roof rack body covers and run the wire into there, down the driver column, and into the engine bay. I ordered a distribution block so I can just connect all accessories right there and have the fuses easy to get to instead of using an inline or something.   That's the plan. The distribution block is coming in tomorrow, so hopefully I can work on it. :)"

battlewagon,2e0y92,ssschillings,5,Tue Aug 19 22:22:17 2014 UTC,Awesome! What did you use for the lift? Forester struts? Spacers?
battlewagon,2e0y92,THEMCV,9,Tue Aug 19 22:39:53 2014 UTC,"Just a simple set of Fozzy XT struts form a local scrapper, General Grabber A/T 2s, forestor trailing arm brackets, and a hammer. Hammer was to knock down a piece of body that protruded a little to close for comfort. I get some rubbing at full lock on the fender well liners. Currrent thought is to find some stiff plastic, cut out the offending area, then rivet in a sort of domed piece to cover the gap. Simply pulling them out exposes lots of important wires to the elements. I have a friend that does metal fab work, and after the current harvest season, he's gonna fab up some under armor, and posssibly a brush gaurd with a winch mount, somewhere between the Primitive racing one and the Gorilla off road one. Idea would be to have a removable winch that could be moved front or back to suit the situation."
battlewagon,2e0y92,RogueSteel,2,Tue Aug 19 23:17:45 2014 UTC,This is so sick! I love it! ♥  I'm curious as well what you did to lift it! :)
battlewagon,2e0y92,RogueSteel,2,Tue Aug 19 22:54:50 2014 UTC,Any videos?
battlewagon,2e0y92,Vwr32,2,Tue Aug 19 23:41:18 2014 UTC,"Not since It was lifted, and probably not till Nov. Currently working grape harves, 70-80 work weeks, no more than a few hours notice typically for shifts. But I'll have the car paid off, Credit card paid off, off and ""maybe"" go stage 2. I feel like that's plenty of power, and I'll focus on suspension after that."

battlewagon,2e1a0g,boxerswag,3,Wed Aug 20 02:37:50 2014 UTC,Awesome. I actually might have found a racing team that used to race sportages at darkar (hopefully I spelled that right) and they might have the old designs for the skid plates which would save me tons of time trying to figure out what I need to make them
battlewagon,2e1a0g,boxerswag,3,Wed Aug 20 02:46:53 2014 UTC,Maybe a dumb question?  But when will you actually use those lights?
battlewagon,2e1a0g,duminacan,3,Wed Aug 20 02:06:26 2014 UTC,"They definitely are partially for show, but having the extra light output on a trail is extremely handy. Being able to see more at night off-road is very nice."
battlewagon,2e1a0g,duminacan,3,Wed Aug 20 02:08:49 2014 UTC,You can also light them up on back roads at night for extra visibility.
battlewagon,2e1a0g,Rilnac,3,Wed Aug 20 02:11:56 2014 UTC,That too! :)
battlewagon,2e1a0g,ReptarSonOfGodzilla,3,Wed Aug 20 02:20:39 2014 UTC,Mannn it's looking AWESOME! You've made such a transformation. Sweet wagon.

battlewagon,2e1a0g,DionysusDerp,2,Sun Aug 24 00:12:02 2014 UTC,Thanks a bunch! :)   I actually haven't wired it yet! I'm planning on drilling into the piece that the rack rail goes into.

I've been on the fence between standard floods like a set of hellas, or trying to do some LED bars. A few years ago the concensus was the LED's were not yet up to par, at least not in any reasonable price range. Also, I love the top mount, no idea why they are not more popular in the subaru crowd. They should give a much better light field at night when off road."

battlewagon,2dzo3v,THEMCV,1 point,Tue Aug 19 16:45:54 2014 UTC,I  plan on welding a receiver hitch mount to my bumpers when I build them so I can have a removable winch that I can put on the front or rear depending on how I'm stuck.

battlewagon,2dzo3v,ReptarSonOfGodzilla,1 point,Wed Aug 20 19:10:09 2014 UTC,I'm not sure what kind of structure is behind the bumper bit if there was a way to fabricate some sort of Mount that would sit behind your license plate and have the license plate on hinges. The only problem would be keeping the license from flapping around
battlewagon,2dzo3v,Shittypumpkin2,2,Wed Aug 20 21:07:18 2014 UTC,"I was thinking a lower mount might be possible. With a primitive racing bolt through bar, and then mount a hitch flush to the front, and sticking back into the lower grill? Although In case of an accident it would be prone to radiator damage. Although at that point perhaps not such a big concern."
battlewagon,2dzo3v,ReptarSonOfGodzilla,1 point,Thu Aug 21 19:43:57 2014 UTC,Either way it's not going to be an easy task but I would definitely be interested in seeing what you do.

battlewagon,2dybxk,alcoslushies,8,Tue Aug 19 06:21:45 2014 UTC,It is typically used in a derogatory way to describe Japanese tuner cars. Don't know why a guy buying a Subaru would even say that. There are some awesome pavement only Subarus out there.
battlewagon,2dybxk,vbwstripes,9,Tue Aug 19 06:51:44 2014 UTC,"I think there is a difference between tuner and ricer. Tuners usually have nice sounding exhausts and other upgrades to gain proper performance. I always think ricers are the guys that buy all of their parts at Autozone, get the loudest fart can exhaust they can find and don't forget about painting the drum brakes."

Chopped springs, AZ hood scoops, vinyl carbon fiber print on every body panel, $200 tow hooks on cars without body kits, walmart special rims on ultra thin tires. Super massive fart can axle backs, cherry bombs, glasspacks. Basically things that are cheap and/or serve little to no purpose, or even degrade performance. Where i lived, primarily honda civics with ""custom"" exhaust, chopped springs, spray can black hood, those little side vent things sold at AZ, Pepboys, etc. and cheap dual 12'' subs that rattle their body panels off. Another common feature is raw urethane skirts and lips, since they could.t afford to paint them.

battlewagon,2dy4dz,TheSporkening,2,Tue Aug 19 04:28:23 2014 UTC,Haha exactly what I said. The reviews on amazon are surprisingly good too.
battlewagon,2dy4dz,TheSporkening,2,Tue Aug 19 04:32:07 2014 UTC,"I tend to trust my gut on things like this, but good reviews by actual owners are about the only thing that can sway me."
battlewagon,2dy4dz,TheSporkening,2,Tue Aug 19 04:51:05 2014 UTC,Agreed. Any clue where I might find some real flares for my element? The arches are round like an f-150. I don't know the dimensions of those arches though and the flares available are too expensive for me haha.
battlewagon,2dy4dz,chrisinvt,2,Tue Aug 19 04:55:02 2014 UTC,I have never seen flares on an E. Figure our where else in the world Elements are sold and scour that country's aftermarket.
battlewagon,2dy4dz,chrisinvt,2,Tue Aug 19 05:54:16 2014 UTC,Good call! I'll do that. Thanks!
battlewagon,2dy4dz,Cyfun06,2,Tue Aug 19 05:56:17 2014 UTC,You have me looking at Molle seat covers for my Highlander. I had never even heard of them before your Monster Element thread. Did you ever check out that poptop camper option? I have wanted an E-Camper since I learned of their existence.

battlewagon,2dw8dm,SneakyLoner,2,Mon Aug 18 19:22:33 2014 UTC,Probably about 10k including the cost of the car. Most of the upgrades cost me time rather than money and I don't dare add that up haha.

battlewagon,2dw8dm,chedda,2,Tue Aug 19 08:16:56 2014 UTC,"Just a response to what everyone has posted, I'd say these costs are relatively small compared to most project cars.  Seems like a cheap way to get a car, modify it, and beat on it."

battlewagon,2dw8dm,ReptarSonOfGodzilla,1 point,Wed Aug 20 00:23:08 2014 UTC,"Sadly, these are mostly repairs but I think I'm sitting at right around $5500 or so..."
battlewagon,2dw8dm,THEMCV,1 point,Mon Aug 18 19:54:18 2014 UTC,"Probably about $2000.  Initial cost of buying the car was $1500, however it came with an EJ swap, front tube bumper and Hellas.  I home-fabricated my lift brackets and rear tube bumper, and the only real thing I spent money on were my 15"" redrilled 6 lug steelies for $30, and a set of walmart-special Wranglers for $320.  Dunno if the timing belt kit counts as that's maintenance, but that was about $100. Fucking tensioner pulley was most of that. : /"
battlewagon,2dw8dm,ReptarSonOfGodzilla,1 point,Tue Aug 19 00:48:50 2014 UTC,"Probably about $2k.   My front and top lights, mud flaps, skid plates, exhaust and installation, misc stuff like Goo Gone, interior LEDs and strips, platidip, new head lights, CB radio equipment, external PA speaker, and sound system. I feel like I'm missing some, but that should be about it.  I really need to spend the money on new brakes and rotors. Mine shake like crazy when I put on the brakes.... or I could save for my lift. :p"
battlewagon,2dw8dm,THEMCV,1 point,Tue Aug 19 03:30:27 2014 UTC,"Just about $1500.

Was damn near stuck at one point, and managed to rip off one of my mud flaps, the piece of palstic in front a the rear wheel that ataches to the side skirt, the side skirt, and snapped a front left end link bolt.

battlewagon,2du11t,Shittypumpkin2,4,Mon Aug 18 00:57:19 2014 UTC,You can stop by Iowa on the way and we can start a convoy
battlewagon,2du11t,THEMCV,3,Mon Aug 18 01:13:40 2014 UTC,Now that would be awesome. Show up with a battlewagon platoon. :p
battlewagon,2du11t,Shittypumpkin2,1 point,Mon Aug 18 01:29:20 2014 UTC,Definitely! Plus I'm thinking about planning a trip with a couple of buddies to moab Utah that would make a great stop on the way to or from.

battlewagon,2duc89,The_NOT-A-BOT_Bot,0,Mon Aug 18 01:44:53 2014 UTC,"tunnel    That's an underpass, actually..."
battlewagon,2dux3o,TheSporkening,4,Mon Aug 18 04:32:14 2014 UTC,"State parks are awesome. Here in TX many have cabins and screened shelters as well as tent sites. Lots of people can occupy a site, sharing gear and costs. I imagine it's the same all across the country. The BLM and the Corps of Engineers also operate inexpensive campgrounds. Then there is boondocking. Free camping, lots more gear required for a good time, but completely doable with a big crew and shared gear.  On your trip, get gas and groceries way off the interstates if possible. It's cheaper. Avoid fast food. You have a year, read some Yelp reviews and plan your stops to hit small local businesses along the way. Think of the income you can bring to mom and pop joints with a convoy of Soobies. They might throw you a parade!  Pt. Townsend is way out in the boonies from Seattle. Great place for this kind of thing. Gas can be pricier out there than in Seattle so tank up in the city."
battlewagon,2dux3o,Shittypumpkin2,2,Tue Aug 19 05:57:52 2014 UTC,"Camping seems like the best idea, definitely.   I like the idea of stopping at small businesses!  That'd be a nice boost if we got a good amount of people!   Thanks for the tip! I would have thought it would have been opposite, honestly."
battlewagon,2dux3o,Shittypumpkin2,3,Tue Aug 19 11:17:59 2014 UTC,"I am definitely in. Just a thought to possibly keep the cost a touch lower, instead of hotels, camping. When I used to go on big group trips to West Virginia we would stay at KOA's in one big site for a pretty reasonable price as long as we called ahead by a few weeks."
battlewagon,2dux3o,Shittypumpkin2,2,Mon Aug 18 04:49:25 2014 UTC,"Oh wow, that's a great idea! That would significantly cut costs down.  The only downside I would see is if people didn't have much/any camping gear, it might not be a great few nights. :p"
battlewagon,2dux3o,boxerswag,2,Mon Aug 18 04:58:27 2014 UTC,I've got a  huge 10 person tent and a few smaller ones that I would be willing to bring along plus stoves and all that good stuff. We'll just have to see what everyone else is up to doing
battlewagon,2dux3o,Shittypumpkin2,2,Mon Aug 18 05:05:22 2014 UTC,That sounds perfect! And definitely. I'll try to do some research on camping areas on the way there.
battlewagon,2dux3o,boxerswag,2,Mon Aug 18 05:07:25 2014 UTC,As soon as I can get off my phone and back on a computer I plan on doing the same
battlewagon,2dux3o,Shittypumpkin2,2,Mon Aug 18 05:18:46 2014 UTC,We can sleep in our cars too. Even my Impreza can fit two people if they be snugglin'.
battlewagon,2dux3o,boxerswag,1 point,Sun Aug 24 01:21:41 2014 UTC,Don't forget about the gear you will have. I plan on putting most of mine  inside for the drive rather than the roof rack to keep as many mpg's as possible and my girlfriend wouldn't be to happy with sleeping in the car anyways.
battlewagon,2dux3o,Shittypumpkin2,2,Sun Aug 24 01:31:52 2014 UTC,"Mmm, true. If it's just me though, I can store clothes in the passenger footwell, gear in the seat, tools and other gear on one side of the cargo area and a nook for me to sleep in! Need to make a fairing for my roof rack too. With A/C I should be able to get 27 or so highway, A/C off up to 30!"

battlewagon,2dux3o,duminacan,1 point,Sun Aug 24 02:45:27 2014 UTC,I haven't had ac since I bought it almost four years ago. No belt or compressor but the pully is there and the lines are plugged with a cork and tape so hopefully it will be an easy fix this winter
battlewagon,2dux3o,duminacan,3,Sun Aug 24 03:02:13 2014 UTC,"If I have the funds to do it and can miss work for a few days, I'm doing it. :) It'd just be that much better if we could get a convoy of people going in that direction and all camping out on our way.  :)"

battlewagon,2dux3o,Shittypumpkin2,2,Wed Aug 20 23:34:55 2014 UTC,"I'm in Maryland, right where Pennsylvania, west Virginia and Maryland sort of meet up"
battlewagon,2dux3o,DionysusDerp,2,Wed Aug 20 23:38:19 2014 UTC,"Okay, I see. You're still quite a bit east from me.   Basically, next year I'm going to have points and times that we all meet up and ride on together. So it'd be like ""everybody from x East meet here"". We're going up pretty much in the middle of the US, so everybody should have a chance to meet up with us. For people East of us, you might have to leave a few hours earlier than I would so we could all meet at the same time.   I feel like I made that complicated. :p"
battlewagon,2dux3o,duminacan,3,Wed Aug 20 23:43:34 2014 UTC,"I gotcha, haha. I'm definitely interested though, should be a fun ride."
battlewagon,2dux3o,duminacan,2,Wed Aug 20 23:54:29 2014 UTC,"Hey as far as route to the western seaboard, what do you think about the Oregon trail?"
battlewagon,2dux3o,duminacan,2,Wed Aug 20 23:59:28 2014 UTC,"That would be a lot of fun... We'd have to go more South to get to it (from where I am), but it's be pretty cool to meet there..   I need to look into it more, but that'd be really cool. :)"
battlewagon,2dux3o,Shittypumpkin2,3,Thu Aug 21 14:14:41 2014 UTC,"I did some research on it earlier and it would be a bit farther for you, but you drive through Yellowstone national park, that right there sold me. I could pm you some information about stuff along that highway..."
battlewagon,2dux3o,duminacan,2,Thu Aug 21 16:47:16 2014 UTC,"Sure! I'd be down for that! This night be dumb... But is the Oregon Trail still an actual trail and not paved? If we could take that instead of the highway, that would be seriously amazing."
battlewagon,2dux3o,Shittypumpkin2,2,Thu Aug 21 17:00:06 2014 UTC,"The oregon trail would really be US highway 20. So it is paved, and it's only a two lane highway which is nice I'm my opinion because we wouldn't just be flying through every state.  http://www.roadtripusa.com/routes/oregontrail/oregontrail.html  Check it out, this is just some basic information"
battlewagon,2dux3o,duminacan,2,Thu Aug 21 17:40:47 2014 UTC,"Oh wow, that would be really amazing! I say we definitely take that way."

So far he's been fixing things to make it run better, on this trip in particular the brakes started grinding pretty badly so he's gonna need brakes soon. He's considering doing bigger tires and lift, also a light bar but he's going to have to hold back on that stuff for a bit. Its stock except for he tints an roof rack, doing the plastidip was easy. We did the side skirts, emblem and also took off some badges, that back piece and the trunk handle took us an afternoon to do, just make sure if you do it have plenty of tape and a second helping hand :)"

battlewagon,2dfmra,SunkSubmarines,3,Wed Aug 13 15:33:29 2014 UTC,With six years of AWD Element ownership behind me I can honestly say you aren't missing out on much. The AWD system they use is pretty much shit if you actually find yourself in situations where you actually need it. I really loved having an Element but it going remote in the winter was pretty much out of the question and I couldn't get past that.
battlewagon,2dfmra,carnut37,2,Wed Aug 13 18:17:21 2014 UTC,really? i had no issues with my first gen crv last winter. it has basically the same awd system. i outperformed a jeep liberty in drifted fields and ditches at one point this winter.
battlewagon,2dfmra,atomic22,3,Wed Aug 13 21:46:15 2014 UTC,"The problem is that the rear wheels kick in only when the front slips and if you aren't slipping all that much, no big deal, the system works great. When you are slipping constantly the RT4WD system (that consists of a couple of hydraulic pumps to kick the rear in when needed) has a tendency to get hot and when it gets hot enough, it disengages to avoid grenading. I was pretty regularly going back country in the mountains on unplowed dirt roads and invariably the AWD would stop working when the road got steep and I'd get stuck. Spent the last two winters of Element ownership borrowing a friends Xterra (ugh) to make the trip so I wouldn't get stuck shoveling out miles away from civilization.  I really loved my little Element, decent gas milage, comfortable, manual transmission, and easy to sleep in. Loud as fuck inside on the freeway as delivered, but nothing a Saturday and some RAAMmat couldn't cure. If it weren't for the sorry excuse for AWD I'd still own it today.  Currently I'm driving a 2013 Outback. Other than the fact that the AWD actually kicks ass and it came with a manual transmission I rather dislike this car and I'm going to kick it to the curb the day the engine warranty expires."

The auto-trans and push-button 4x4 are definitely the weak spots, though.  But if you're gonna lift it, the taller gearing will definitely kill you if you don't have low range.  And those automatics were too weak to throw much more power at.  Here's what I would recommend: tracking down a dual range wagon and selling this one, or doing a duel-range manual trans swap, which is gonna be a pain cause you're gonna need to find a donor car to steal clutch and shift linkages from.  And if you're gonna go to the trouble to find a donor car which probably has a bad engine, you might as well just get the donor car running, and possibly do an EJ22 swap.  If you're gonna go to the trouble to keep the car and swap in a manual, you might as well track down an EJ22 to swap in as well.  You'll also want a whole donor car for that as you'll wanna steal the ECU, wiring harness, and a lot of misc random crap.  And as your current engine/trans are in decent shape, you could probably get some money back out of them if you sell them.  This subreddit isn't a great resource on such swaps, I'm afraid.  But the USMB is!"
battlewagon,2d721g,Cyfun06,2,Mon Aug 11 06:01:13 2014 UTC,"Man thanks. Your the first person to give me REALLY good advice. It's good to know it's my tranny that's the power problem. I thought the engine must suck cuz I can't do better than 45 uphill with no load.    I'll most likely not lift it after what you told me. I'll just stick with the bumper and mini mud tires.   If I ever do build a battlewagon can you suggest a base car to modify? Like Brand,Model,Year,ext."
battlewagon,2d721g,baccaruda66,1 point,Mon Aug 11 22:42:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah, those engines aren't the best. You're really better off starting with an early 5-speed Legacy wagon (for cargo and travelling) or Impreza wagon (for offroad / better approach & departure angles). You'll start with the more versatile 5-lug bolt pattern, an EJ22, and more aftermarket solutions for suspension and accessories. The market for lift kits for post-EA82 vehicles isn't as robust but it can be dealt with. You can also swap in an imported EJ-series dual range transmission from an importer. Check out the Offroad section on USMB... pretty much anything you want to do has been done before for you to research.  Also, pre-EJ cars don't have cupholders built in :("

battlewagon,2d2al8,MostDefiantly,3,Sun Aug 10 03:59:16 2014 UTC,"Nothing wrong with the kit glass. Don't start buying expensive stuff until you start to feel your stuff is starting to limit you.   I used to have a setup of three lenses that I loved to death.  Sigma 12-24.  It has lovely character and not much distortion even though it is wide. Downside is a small f-stop.  Sigma 30mm f/1,4.   It also has brilliant character, huuuge f-stop and perfect for portraits and low light conditions.  Canon 70-200 f/4. Sharp, reliable focus and widely available used.  Circular polarizers are good for cars and still life.  Then a good flash and a transmitter. A flash unit used properly can transform the way you take pictures.  It doesn't have to cost much to get good gear. It's just easy to get the gear bug. And spend a lot with little payback."

I'm afraid it's going to be too much, but I'm not sure.... King Springs + KYB GR-2s are definitely in my future. I'm doing research (and have been for a long time) on if adding 1"" spacers is too much for everything. I don't think so. I believe I'll only need these to correct rear camber, but I'm just worried about subframe stuff. Apparently most things are good up to 2"". I guess we'll see.  Make sure to post pictures of before and after! I really want to see! :)"
battlewagon,2d2qvn,THEMCV,2,Sat Aug 9 16:02:41 2014 UTC,I am not doing spacers and the struts are just oem replacements because they are cheaper. I wanted a slight lift but not enough that I would have to worry about anything breaking.

battlewagon,2d0jcg,SirTechDiff,4,Fri Aug 8 20:47:15 2014 UTC,"Do you want a Loyale or a GL?  Loyale are lesser versions.  No dual range and less options.  GL can be had with a dual range and varying options from 85-89.  I am 6' and I can sleep in the back if I lay at an angle from one corner to the other.  Gas mileage is OK to start, maybe mid to high 20s.  With lift and big tires expect maybe high teens while be relatively gutless.  Transmission will be smooth if it was taken care of properly.  4x4 is pretty good but axles and drivetrain parts get stressed with mods.  Don't expect truck level off road ability.  Possibly look into early 90s legacys as they are almost comparable in price these days.  More power and more space but no dual range without a big swap.  Let me know if you have any more questions."
battlewagon,2d0jcg,NeilOMalley,2,Fri Aug 8 21:55:26 2014 UTC,I meant GL. I guess I should also ask how comfy the seats are.
battlewagon,2d0jcg,NeilOMalley,2,Fri Aug 8 22:08:33 2014 UTC,They are ok.  I'm a bigger guy and have done some 5+ hours trip with some stops to stretch.  Will probably swap them for legacy or better seats soon.

battlewagon,2d0jcg,Get_Lifted,5,Fri Aug 8 23:44:09 2014 UTC,Love my car to death. I sleep in it all the time. Not as bad as you'd think. My mods effect my mileage pretty a bit. For sure can tell I'm not getting what I used to for gas. It's been a great car and relatively easy to work on as this was my first car I had no prior experience working on cars. The 4x4 impresses a lot of people. I have towed stuck trucks out and towed friends broken cars home. I love mine.
battlewagon,2d0jcg,Get_Lifted,2,Sat Aug 9 01:23:41 2014 UTC,Also I swapped a dual range into my loyale. Easy swap as the transmissions are the same size and bolt up almost exactly the same aside from the dual range linkage.

battlewagon,2cwhct,memory_limit,1 point,Fri Aug 8 00:57:09 2014 UTC,4k is far too steep. 3k at the most.
battlewagon,2cwhct,baconsnuggles,1 point,Fri Aug 8 16:53:18 2014 UTC,you can get a bugeye wrx with less mileage at that price.  You can try talking him down but i doubt he would cut the price down to the 2k its worth.
battlewagon,2cwhct,boxerswag,3,Fri Aug 8 02:30:21 2014 UTC,Bugeye would be in ragged shape at 4k. NA is the way to go under about $8k IMO.

battlewagon,2cs75s,FesteringNeonDistrac,1 point,Wed Aug 6 19:29:34 2014 UTC,"H6 bolted right in. Clutch swapped right on. Mechanically, no issues.  Wiring and radiator were a pain in the ass though. Wiring is mostly simple (like 14 wires merged total). The radiator was the biggest problem, but even that was relatively simple.  If you don't want to deal with radiator issues, you can use a stock radiator on an EZ swap (as opposed to the much longer EG motors). But the EZ swaps have more wiring involved (OBD2). So it's a toss-up."

battlewagon,2cqq49,THEMCV,6,Wed Aug 6 00:59:39 2014 UTC,"I got stuck for a bit the other day on a muddy hill. I was on my way back on this trail and after scraping my front bumper, I came to a large, muddy hole. I had two options. One, I could try to make it, but I wasn't out with anybody and wasn't planning on getting into anything too serious. Two, I could backup a bit, fit into a small cutout about the size of my Outback, and turn around. I opted for the  second option.   So after backing up and getting my car in the parking space of nature, I put it in reverse. As I depress to pedal, I'm greeted with the VDC activity light going solid, telling me I pulled into something a lot wetter than I thought with my street tires.   I give it some gas, and it doesn't seem to want to go. Great.   I hop out and look at my options. It wasn't that steep, but there was brush on the other side of the trail. I decided that ""more skinny pedal"" was the better option here, risking a few light scratches.   I turned off VDC, pulled forward slightly, then put down the gas. It was the magic trick. I propelled out of the wet hill and backed slowly into some brush. Realizing I didn't actually have a lot of room to turn around, I decided that driving over top of the brush was a better option. I shoved my car through it, eventually turning back onto the trail and leaving.   Shaking only slightly, I got out, checked for damage, and drank some water.   And that's how I realized I needed A/T tires sooner rather than later."

There was a good hole behind one of our movie theaters here in town that everyone used to go on the weekends.   I decided I would try to get through it because it didn't look too bad. But I was wrong the ruts were a lot deeper than they appeared and I ended up with water halfway up my door and mud up to the axles.

I would check your local shops and see if anybody could fab up something.   Or if you really wanted to pay out (IMO it's not worth it at all) you could get this bumper for a couple grand. It's the only one made for our models I believe, which is unfortunate."
battlewagon,2ci9ie,THEMCV,1 point,Sun Aug 3 15:43:35 2014 UTC,"Ah, I have seen that design around! Wasn't sure if it was made by another guys (and sold) or something somebody made. That price is pretty high too.  I got quoted ~$300 for mine."
battlewagon,2ci9ie,THEMCV,1 point,Mon Aug 4 02:08:36 2014 UTC,Usually off road stuff for Subaru's is pretty expensive because of such low demand.  For $900 I am only $200 away from a high quality plate bumper for my Tacoma.  That's why I am doing it myself.  How heavy duty are you going?
battlewagon,2ci9ie,NeilOMalley,1 point,Mon Aug 4 03:46:01 2014 UTC,"The plan is using 1.5"" DOM tubing. Hopefully that'll hold up well."
battlewagon,2ci9ie,THEMCV,1 point,Mon Aug 4 05:47:24 2014 UTC,That's exactly what I'm using.  You should be good.  Are you using stock mount points or reinforcing the front?
battlewagon,2ci9ie,NeilOMalley,1 point,Mon Aug 4 05:52:30 2014 UTC,Welding onto the stock mounting points. Not sure where else I could actually reinforce it thinking about it. Are you reinforcing yours?
battlewagon,2ci9ie,THEMCV,1 point,Mon Aug 4 05:55:57 2014 UTC,"For now its mounted to the stock location and the bottom of the core support.  After WCSS we are looking at cutting out the bottom and tying it into the frame rails so the winch plate won't get ripped out with a hard pull.  Also should be stronger than the car itself, so the bumper will survive a hit but will probably wipe out the rest of the front end."
battlewagon,2ci9ie,NeilOMalley,1 point,Mon Aug 4 06:13:34 2014 UTC,"That's a good idea. I know Gorilla Offroad's Off Road bar for the Outback is a skid plate, winch mount, and light bar all in one and it connects to the underside.  That's probably true, but I'm going to bet that if I get in an accident, it's going to be bad enough to mess up my front end already. I'm a pretty vigilant driver, so I don't think I'd be the one to hit somebody, but somebody could definitely always hit me."

battlewagon,2cchju,THEMCV,17,Fri Aug 1 16:22:01 2014 UTC,"Well, the thing to realize is that your bumper won't do anything that the OEM bumper wouldn't have already done.  The stock bumper is a metal beam, covered in styrofoam. It's not going to affect the airbgs, because those sensors are mounted behind the bumper, so any force great enough to set them off wouldn't be absorbed by your tube bumper.  As to ""Removing your crumple zones"" that's a load of false engineering as well. Your crumple zone has nothing to do with your 5mph bumper. Your hood, your frame, your fenders, your radiator support, all these things are unaffected by the extra mass hanging off the front.   As to the bumper going straight into the engine, sure it will! But so will the stock one. And your tube bumper will absorb a greater amount of force before doing so.   So quit worrying!"

battlewagon,2c2ium,obsd97,5,Tue Jul 29 19:20:13 2014 UTC,"jeep wheels are direct bolt ons.   i dont know shit about the suspensions. best place to start would be on a forum for donks. avalon is the same as es300 camry and solara, and plenty of those are rollin on donks. you are doing the exact same thing in principle.   you can buy a bolt on supercharger. avalons will fuckin move.   your car is pretty nice though, so I dunno. maybe it looks good in the pics and the interior and drivetrain are close to done. whatever works.  if you want to get crazy get another avalon, do a push you pull me, but flip the engine around and have 6 liter v12 50/50 weight distro toyota beastalon. then jack it up and run it on 35s  plastidip or linex it. i would go with jeep canyon or aluminum wagon wheels personally.

($436.00)  Skid plates are essential to keeping your car safe on the trail! (406.30 if you get all three)  (Here on out you can decide what you'd actually like/need.  Here's a good roof rack for the money ($118.95) You can buy the extension as well. :) ($56.99)  Hella 500s are pretty tried and true, but you're going to need somewhere to mount them! You could also look into an LED light bar (That's one I'm getting. :)) ($77.11)  Rally Innovations makes a light bar for ($270) I've recently not heard good things about Rally Innovations by the way and Primitive makes one as well for ($255).  So if you were to get all of this stuff and the Rally Innovations bar, you'd be at $1365.35 which gives you plenty of wiggle room for shipping. :)  Hope this helps! :)"
battlewagon,2bytjs,ReptarSonOfGodzilla,2,Mon Jul 28 19:16:39 2014 UTC,"Upvote for all but the RI light bar. I've heard more than a few people complain that they don't sit very firm, and tend to bounce and rub. Primitive makes a bolt through that's tough as nails. Website is primitive as it get's but send an e-mail, and Paul will send you some pics, and be more than happy to answer any questions you have on any off road related builds. Another option is the Skidplate/lightbar/wenchmount/brushgaurd from Gorilla. All of the options start to get pricey, but it's a straight bolt on, and looks damn good. http://www.gorillaoffroadcompany.com/product-detail.cfm/prd_key/44 Also, throw in some mud flaps, keeps the rock chips down."

I'd do some more research on that, but generally you can fit one size bigger. :)   Hope this helps some. :)"

battlewagon,2bqkjg,ReptarSonOfGodzilla,2,Fri Aug 8 04:41:41 2014 UTC,"Seem just fine to me, the Les Schwabb that I got mine from had a guy their that RallyX'd his STI. After talking with him and the sales guy for an hour or so, We settled on the Grabbers. Basically, they were the stiffest off road tire available, without giving up off road performance, and the best off road, short of super swampers, without being undrivable on a daily commute. And as for high speeds, how high are you trying to go? 135 straight out felt comfortable, and canyons runs chasing my friends enduro were a blast. Sure, not suitable for drifting or AutoX events, but amazing for tearing down forest service roads at 50mph, or tearing up some mud at a friends ranch.   EDIT: I will say, they are a ""tad"" loud in town, but at freeway speeds, or under any acceleration, engine noise drowns out  the tires. Although I'm told you can hear me about 1-2 blocks away. I don't even notice it now after 2 months though."
battlewagon,2bqkjg,ViAlexis,1 point,Mon Aug 11 06:39:18 2014 UTC,"I'm only thinking freeway speeds, probably no faster than 80mph and even then, rarely. My friend has been making them sound like they'd be unsuitable for my daily highway driving at ~60mph, but it seems you've had very good experiences with them. I'm pretty much sold on getting a set, hopefully before winter strikes and maybe before then. There's a great many dirt roads where I live that are just a little too unnerving to drive on in the worn all-seasons that came on my Outback when I got her.  Thanks for your reply, though! Definitely gonna save up for a set myself."

The day before that I was working on a 10"" sine plate, determining flatness and parallelism on each surface to all other surfaces to within 0.0003"" TIR.  I did that mostly using a digital height gage aligned between two gage blocks at the max and min deviation I was hoping to see.  I did a micrometer the other day at 0.00005"" accuracy and I had to determine the flatness of the head and anvil to within 12.5 micro inches, as the USAF demands a 4:1 accuracy ratio.  The wavelength of helium is 23.2 micro inches and we can see each half wave as it interferes on each side of the glass and based on the curvature and intersection of the interference lines tell how flat the steel is.  Based on how they curve I can actually tell exactly whether the surface is concave, convex, slanted, burred, etc as each has a different pattern of light they will interfere upon.  My ""primary"" area though is low frequency high accuracy ppm electrical readings.  DC and AC volts, capacitance, resistance, current, that sort of thing. I am also the primary TACAN guy for our aircraft systems, and then I do all of the power sensors and vibration pickups and analyzers.    I've got an associates in Applied Electronics and enough credits for a BS, but I need to fill some classes and have little motivation.  The job isn't about a degree, it's about experience really.  I have lots of intelligent guys that are just not that great at the job because they don't apply it well, it's like they can answer you if you ask them the question, but they don't problem solve on their own using what they know, it just doesn't click.  Once you get in, you can really get quite advanced, as you can tell, clearly my knowledge level is well above an associates in applied electronics, but you just have to do a lot of self study.  I don't know if I answered all your questions or too much, if you have other questions go for it."

battlewagon,2blxec,BlackholeZ32,1 point,Fri Jul 25 03:45:48 2014 UTC,"Tactical air navigation system:       A tactical air navigation system, commonly referred to by the acronym TACAN, is a navigation system used by military aircraft. It provides the user with bearing and distance (slant-range) to a ground or ship-borne station. It is a more accurate version of the VOR/DME system that provides bearing and range information for civil aviation. The DME portion of the TACAN system is available for civil use; at VORTAC facilities where a VOR is combined with a TACAN, civil aircraft can receive VOR/DME readings. Aircraft equipped with TACAN avionics can use this system for en route navigation as well as non-precision approaches to landing fields. The space shuttle is one such vehicle that was designed to use TACAN navigation [citation needed] (although it has since been upgraded with GPS as a replacement).    Image i - VORTAC TGO (TANGO) Germany. The TACAN antenna is the highest antenna in the center of the image.

If i dont get it back together tomorrow, ill grab some more feeler gauges, just out of sheer curiosity.   If the college was open we'd be able to use the ones from the gunsmithing shop."
battlewagon,2blxec,503maple,2,Fri Jul 25 05:53:56 2014 UTC,"Depending on the type of gasket used, requirements on the flatness of the surfaces can vary. The gaskets for those types of engines are probably fairly forgiving."

battlewagon,2blxec,d00m3d_d00d,2,Fri Jul 25 05:59:30 2014 UTC,"Had a buddy in his turbo Volvo 240 run with me in my 300ZX TT, an E36 M3 and a C5 Z06 Vett on some canyon runs. A ways through, we decided to pull off for a bit to see the scenery. He pulled up and said that his car didn't seem to happy, and thought he might have blown the HG. Sure enough the oil was slightly milky. It still ran ok, so he decided to limp it back to town. Guess that built engine he had been talking about is finally happening. Funny thing is it ran tip top all the way home. It must have just lifted the head a bit and healed up when it stopped getting wailed on. Some of those older cars were just built to be beaten and shrug it off."
battlewagon,2blxec,RumorsOFsurF,3,Fri Jul 25 06:08:03 2014 UTC,"I blew the headgasket in my cressida with a 5mge. (Warped it when a line came off at a drift event and she got warm). I was in the middle of nowhere. With nothing but a coke bottle. Thankfully there was a river nearby, and after letting it cool down i topped her off with river water and drove her home and then for the next two days. Still ran fine but oil went milky on me by the second day. The head on that one is junk due to other reasons and ive got a good fresh one to put on.   Luckily the tercel didnt go milkshake on me. Sure put off our plans of riding doorless on the beach though."

battlewagon,2b80kh,carnut37,2,Mon Jul 21 08:33:20 2014 UTC,I purchased this car last April so it's been a few months! I got it from two younger gentlemen. Our first test drive was a beer run and we had a little grill-out when I picked the car up---good times. They had bought the car from the original owner's neighbor in Pennsylvania after she passed away. The car was little-old-lady owned and appears to have been well cared for and had a high quality respray done at one point. Considering it was in the northeast all its life I am still amazed that the car even still exists let alone in the shape it's in!

battlewagon,2argzm,THEMCV,1 point,Tue Jul 15 14:28:50 2014 UTC,I figure the only way it ever gains value for resale is if its a cool project sold to the right buyer but honestly id rather just keep it running for as long as northeastern rust allows.   Suspension stuff isnt normally my thing so im pretty clueless but i guess ill take some measurements compare and see if itll work. Shouldve specified id like to keep the cv angle the same if at all possible ive read some stuff with using outback struts and springs i doubt itd ever fit but maybe even forester? Any insight on that?  Off-road tires are probably going on right after suspension stuff ive got a friend who has some kind that should fit though that he would sell me super cheap.  Those skids look great by the way ill probably go front and back.

battlewagon,2argzm,teefish1,2,Tue Jul 15 15:08:23 2014 UTC,Haha no worries thats what i had been leaning towards but again suspension wise im clueless.  They are supposedly four new tires he bought for his lego before it met its untimely death. So they should be good to go.

battlewagon,2argzm,chrwei,2,Wed Jul 16 04:58:56 2014 UTC,I can't speak for the newest models because I don't have any experience with them but every Subaru generation (and across some generations) shares the same basic undercarriage and engine bay. I love it because it means that I can pull a lot of replacement parts from just about any Subaru in the junk yard and lift or lower them with factory parts. If you use the OB struts you won't have as much room for big tires like you would if you went with the Forester struts. Luckily for all of us Subaru put the worst engine in the biggest cars so we can all have abundant lift parts for really cheap at the local junk yard!

battlewagon,2argzm,shotgun_willie_P,2,Tue Jul 15 14:10:07 2014 UTC,I agree. I wasnt thinking diesel but I will look into that and do some research could be an option if it can be done for a somewhat reasonable cost.

Released in 1997, the VT was updated as a part of the VT II revision in 1999, before being replaced by the VX model in 2000. In 1998, the VT formed the basis of a prototype that became the catalyst for the re-introduction in 2001 of the Holden Monaro coupé—a nameplate on hiatus since 1977.  The VT series was awarded the 1997 Wheels Car of the Year, resulting in the fourth time that this award was won by the Commodore.  It found ready acceptance in the market as many buyers steered away from the Ford AU Falcon, becoming the best selling Commodore to date and cementing its place as number one in Australian sales.

Skid plates keep your underside safe from rocks and large sticks that could otherwise ruin your car and day. :)  Unless you want to fab something up yourself, a light bar is the easiest way to mount lights. Primitive offers light bars as well as Rally Innovations. :)  As far as lights themselves, Hella 500s are often recommended due to their build quality and performance. You can search around and find a light you like based on other's recommendations. :) I run Harbor Freight lights, but I'm going to be upgrading to LED light bars soon. :)  General Grabber AT2s will help you off-road and in the snow. It's an all-terrain, so it should help wherever. :) This size should fit just fine. :)  For some on-road upgrades take a look at sway bars! They'll keep your body roll to a minimum and make your car feel tight. :) I've included the only one that I know fits our wagons. Here's a good read on Sway Bars. :)  Hope this helps. :)"

Here's some from Gorilla Off-Road, Subtle Solutions, and I actually can't seem to find any for the Outback from Paranoid!   I wish I could speak more on the trailing arm brackets. From what I can tell, using Forester trailing arm brackets will fix some issues, but you may not need them for a small lift.  Actually, I can attest for the General Grabbers in the snow. They perform excellent in the snow, although they say ""not rated for deep snow"". You are right though, a set of winter tires would probably be better. :)"

battlewagon,2a6in3,BlueBG82,2,Sun Jul 13 15:24:13 2014 UTC,"I personally would feel fine about putting a new tire with the other 3. The three have less then 1000 miles and still have the nipples on the sides. I do have someone interested in just the wheels. So, let me know soon if you're interested in the wheels and tires."
battlewagon,2a6in3,nnnnnnnnnnm,1 point,Mon Jul 14 13:43:41 2014 UTC,"honestly the wheels interest me less than the tires, but getting the tires mounted & balanced on different wheels would could just as much if not more.

battlewagon,2a6in3,BlueBG82,1 point,Mon Jul 14 15:58:00 2014 UTC,"Well, let me know if you're interested in either of them. The listed ones are $150 for wheels and tires. The orange are $150 for the wheels (no tires). I can get pictures if you want of the orange ones. Unless your Impreza is lifted, the Dunlop tires most likely wouldn't fit.

battlewagon,2a6in3,BlueBG82,1 point,Mon Jul 14 16:46:24 2014 UTC,It was Forester suspension. So maybe 3 inches? The tires would probably just rub on a stock setup. Not sure about an OBS though as they are a tad higher then a regular Impreza.

battlewagon,2a4efm,shotgun_willie_P,2,Wed Jul 9 01:13:40 2014 UTC,"I'll share the solution I've used for years: 1- I always buy my tires from Tirerack. The money I save from not buying from Les Schwab is normally enough to get a spare or 5th from tire rack. 2- When you purchase from Tirerack you have the option to ship the tires to a Tirerack trusted installer that can mount and balance them for you. I have one local that I've dealt with for years that I trust with my car. 3- Get AAA Plus! It's around $100 a year, covers 4 free roadside assistance or tows up to 100 miles anywhere in the States! Not to mention the discounts at restaurants and hotels if you're a traveler!  I've used this a lot on my previous cars ( knock on wood, never on the Subie). I'd double check the roadside, but if I recall I used it at least 5 times one year when I had my old  Corolla, haha. Surprisingly, the 5th one I had to pay for wasn't a bank breaker. Had to be flatbed towed away too.. *Edited to correct info."

battlewagon,2a0bhi,SGFOZZY,2,Mon Jul 7 15:39:06 2014 UTC,"I've had 3 lowered cars in my lifetime:  '90 Nissan 240sx Coupe, '92 Nissan 240sx Hatch and my current '97 BMW 318ti.  They are a ton of fun to drive as long as you buy real suspension parts.  If you just cut the springs you'll just bounce down the road.  It's pretty funny seeing those guys."
battlewagon,2a0bhi,drainhed,2,Mon Jul 7 16:25:37 2014 UTC,"I had a lowered '95 BMW 525i. The thing about lowering a car that's already got a a pretty low center of gravity is that it really doesn't do much to improve handling.  And if it's any sort of daily driver, it just makes it a pain in the ass to avoid scraping bumpers and high centering.  It got beat to shit because the roads don't get plowed in the winter, there are so many ruts and potholes, and then a hailstorm came through and totaled it out.  That's when I realized it's silly to try to keep a nice car in these parts... so then came the battlewagon. :)  There's a guy who comes to our local autocrosses who has a Forester XT that's been tuned to about 300bhp.  The thing is: its ride height is stock!  He just slapped some performance tires on it.  But the best part is that he DOMINATES in the damn slalom!  I have a video of him somewhere pulling a massive drift coming out of it.  But it always cracks me up to see the times, and he's outpacing WRXes."

battlewagon,2a2kjk,THEMCV,2,Mon Jul 7 19:55:24 2014 UTC,When you speak of ground clearance are you talking about distance from your differential or axle to the ground or from the belly of the car to the ground?
battlewagon,2a2kjk,503maple,1 point,Tue Jul 8 04:10:42 2014 UTC,I'm using the officially listed numbers published by the manufacturer. It's typically going to be the lowest part of the car that isn't the tire. On trucks thats almost always the rear differential. On the  Outback I think the rear diff is tucked up enough that it's not the lowest point.
battlewagon,2a2kjk,FesteringNeonDistrac,1 point,Tue Jul 8 19:53:56 2014 UTC,mine's 9 inches clearance i'm pretty sure. it's not so much a matter of capability as i just want to do it lol.  edit: mine's 8.7 as well

Or get to know the guys in your local Subaru club, as they probably know of shit that isn't for sale yet.  I got mine off of CL, but it was about 350 miles away. Normally that's just a 5 hour drive, but I had to take the stupid bus, which ended up being 8 hours.  It was worth it, though, cause the previous owner had already done the EJ22 swap.  In retrospect, it's cheaper and easier to track down an EA82 locally that has a good body, power windows and locks and such, and then track down a phase 1 EJ22 parts car and do the swap yourself.  Mine doesn't have power windows or locks, and is rusty as fuck.  It's embarrassing to go to the junkyard and most of the EA82s there are in better shape than mine."

Air suspension already removed and timing belt just done. I pulled a utility trailer and strapped on a rooftop bag to the rack and drive it back East. It was recently backed into by a county leaf collection truck and was totalled by insurance (they gave me a staggering amount for it!). I beat out the dents, pulled the radiator out of the pulley and have been running it as my battle wagon ever since. Gonna toss Outback struts and 16"" wheels on her soon.

Funny enough.. I was only planning on keeping her through the winter just so I didn't have to ride my new motorcycle in the rain, but I've kinda developed a huge soft spot for this car.

The dirt parts of their rally course had plenty of traction, so having a 4wd car really didn't give them any advantage.  If anything, it slowed them down from the rolling resistance.  The Nissan would have definitely won had it not gotten lost.  I really do wish they'd muddied up the track so the sooby would have been able to show off a little.  What's funny is that it would have kicked ass in the demo derby episode of the show, especially with angle iron bumpers and mud tires.

battlewagon,29lnnn,Cyfun06,3,Wed Jul 2 00:24:12 2014 UTC,My first car was an 83 (I think) Tercel Sr5 4wd manual. Only option it lacked was the rear wiper. Even had the yawl and incline gauges. Some broad hit me and totaled it. It still hauls tanks full of welding gas at the junk yard I sold it to. I gave it up 13 years ago. They are road worriers.

I remember feeling the hit then feeling my right shin hit the dash hard. I looked down to see what I think was the axle sticking through the floor where my foot was. I had a huge bruise on the arch of my foot and a 3 inch very deep gouge on my shin, but other than that, I was good. I was shocked that the car was able to be repaired but he left the hole in the floor, and for all I know he still has the thing, although I've lost touch with him. great cars.."

It was a frequent visitor to Bodie ghost town in the high sierras, as well as weekend camping outings all up and down the california coast. I drove it along route 66, expoloring just about every unpaved offshoot I could find. I got a new job that was a bit of a commute and the old girl was draining my wallet in gas.

battlewagon,29mlin,Suavisification,1 point,Wed Jul 2 18:56:55 2014 UTC,"Just be really careful when you are replacing it - I would often take a piece of painters tarp and wrap the opti before doing anything that put liquid anywhere near it. I cheaped out and went with some aftermarket opti that failed pretty quickly. I even went to the junk yard, and found the remnants of one. The optical sensor that actually does the work is made by delphi, I called them but they wouldn't sell me that part alone. It's a real racket. Haven't priced one out in many years, but IIRC it was around 600 bucks for a new one. If I can stress anything it would be to protect that stupid thing as if it was gold."

My philosophy with this car is sort of middle ground between an overlander and a rally car - rugged and reliable enough to get me to out of the way places but fun to blast down the roads on the way. The car has exceeded my expectations in the fun-to-drive area :) On the handling front it has King springs, a Whiteline front strut brace, and STi 18mm rear sway, and the balance is just perfect on dirt. I can get on the brake entering a corner and it rotates easily, then switch back to slight understeer on throttle to lock it back down anytime. Just a blast.  Fun times ahead.  edit: Bonus video, driving through the jeep trails on the Mt Adams lava beds in Washington state. It's not that interesting of a video, but whatever."

Peeling the dip off was the biggest pain in the ass I have ever dealt with car-wise. There is still dip in the corners of the wheels that I just gave up on. I DO NOT recommend dipping your wheels unless you are going to remove them and use a commercial grade sprayer. I put like 6 coats on using a pistol grip and aerosole can and it didn't peel off evenly. The emblems are a breeze, so go ahead with those, but the wheels.....you have been warned."

battlewagon,293rgx,Aeather,9,Wed Jun 25 23:38:48 2014 UTC,the AMC Eagle is a basass motherfucker.
battlewagon,293rgx,facepillownap,6,Thu Jun 26 03:11:09 2014 UTC,"You mean besides a Subaru GL/Loyale? They're very common, very cheap, and most have a dual range transfer case with part-time 4wd.  Another option would be a Toyota Tercel 4wd, but they're harder to find.  Also, if you're referring to the Civic Wagon made in the late 80s, they honestly suck offroad.  They weren't actually 4wd, but AWD with a viscous center coupling. Their gearing was basically for street driving, so you can't really crawl.  And they aren't easy to lift, and have shitty ground clearance to begin with.  Don't get me wrong, they're good cars, but they're mostly designed towards street and snow driving.  Legacies and Outbacks are great cars as well. Not as good offroad because they're AWD, but they do make for better daily drivers as they're bigger and more comfortable.  Also, I just read down a few posts to where you mention you want something that not everyone else has. You probably should have mentioned that at the very beginning, dude.  But I tell ya: the main reason I got a GLW is because everyone in my town has goddamn Outbacks and WRXs, and I wanted something different.  The 80s Subarus are about the only ""car"" that had an actual part time 4-wheel drive system and not just AWD.  The AMC Eagle is a great choice, but they're essentially a Jeep, and a bitch to find, so you might as well get a Cherokee.  And I love Volvos, but they never came in 4wd. They were all RWD up until 93 (some did actually have factory auto-locking diffs though), and after 93 they got bought by Ford and were kind of crappy, but some did have AWD.  If you're feeling really adventurous, track down a late 80s/early 90s Audi Quattro or VW Quantum Syncro.  They don't have low range, but their Torsen differentials are outstanding in any situation.  Plus, many of them came with FACTORY locking differentials!"
battlewagon,293rgx,Cyfun06,7,Thu Jun 26 13:22:21 2014 UTC,"First generation Subaru Legacy. Especially pre facelift, so 1990 and 1991. They just look angry and scowling.  Parts are easy to come by and pretty cheap, a lot of things from newer subies apply, and they are reliable. How reliable?  I abuse my 91 every day. I ran it three quarts low on oil for a few weeks. It only holds 4 quarts. The timing belt is a 60,000 mile interval. I ran my last one to about 180,000. The clutch is original and has 232,000 miles on it.

battlewagon,2904qs,profetic,4,Wed Jun 25 07:12:59 2014 UTC,"Awesome! How do you like rally x? I've looked into it several times but can never find any information. Can you provide any input on the pricing, required safety precautions, or how fun it is?    Pricing - without SCCA membership, events range from $40-60 in my region  Safety - if your car is legally road worthy, it's good enough to try rally x Edit: helmet is a requirement but many events will have them to loan out or you be able to barrow one from another participant.  Fun - best bang for the buck there is. I took my WRX to my first rally x event this spring. The course was all gravel, even with RA mud flaps I still managed to destroy the paint on my drivers side. No regrets. A month later I had the privileged of driving my first HPDE as well. It was more pricey than rally x and although it was also a ton of fun, I am definitely looking forward to more rally x in the future. Even with a stock vehicle you learn a TON about car control and it all transfers over to real world driving when shitty weather hits.   Tl;Dr - they say driver mod is the best mod, rally x is a fantastic way to have a ton of fun and learn a lot about car control"

battlewagon,28yzv8,THEMCV,1 point,Wed Jun 25 00:48:49 2014 UTC,That is actually a Rage Powersports rack. I went with it because it was pretty economical.  It is a pretty good rack for the price.  However I kind of wished I had shopped around a bit more.  It looks like the roof on the outback can actually accommodate a slightly larger roof rack.  Every time I'm packing gear up there I find myself wishing I had gone with a bigger rack.

battlewagon,28xw3j,ImTheFatMan,3,Tue Jun 24 05:14:00 2014 UTC,Just a theory but you might be able to fit a newer knuckle from a junk yard. Subaru has a beautiful habit of using the same basic idea for the undercarriage as long and as much as possible.
battlewagon,28xw3j,teefish1,1 point,Tue Jun 24 13:20:07 2014 UTC,I too recommend this. I feel like like you could pull the enter assembly at the control/trailing arm and save yourself some time. Brakes might be an issue(or an upgrade!).

battlewagon,28wetv,Likeaboss3o2,1 point,Thu Jun 26 15:40:26 2014 UTC,"I'm assuming that mostly if it has a full frame, it's probably a little bit too big to be a wagon. I may be wrong on that, so somebody can correct me if I'm wrong that most wagons are unibody. :)"
battlewagon,28wetv,MissVancouver,1 point,Thu Jun 26 16:09:40 2014 UTC,"Fairly certain most Cherokees are unibody.  However, Kia Sportages actually do have a body-on-frame setup.  Another important criteria might be axles.  Part of the fun of battlewagon is having shitty articulation due to independent suspension.  If you've got solid axles, you're in a whole 'nother league.  The tricky thing is that essentially all SUVs are technically wagons. We could go by whether something is actually classified as a car or SUV, but that would eliminate pretty much everything except Subarus, Audis, Wagovans, and old Tercels. Hell, I think even new Outbacks are considered SUVs because they've gotten so huge."

battlewagon,28xtac,minizanz,2,Tue Jun 24 08:55:01 2014 UTC,I'm sorry but what's the difference?
battlewagon,28xtac,minizanz,2,Wed Jun 25 00:31:11 2014 UTC,"a wagon is a normal car that has the back end replaced with a C/D pillar and hatch.  a CUV is a crossover utility vehicle.  that is a small-mid SUV that is made to look like a car.  so a wagon is a car with storage space, and a CUV is an SUV trying to be a car.  the 4th gen outback was a car trying to be an SUV, but still a wagon; the 5th gen is a full on SUV but a little too low and not functional to be an SUV.        there are other things legally that make a crossover get registered differently and get less strict epa standards."
battlewagon,28xtac,musubk,1 point,Wed Jun 25 04:42:21 2014 UTC,So do you not consider the 2011-2014 Legacy to be a normal car? It's the same as the Outback minus the hatch and some suspension parts.
battlewagon,28xtac,minizanz,1 point,Sat Jun 28 08:09:46 2014 UTC,"the 5th gen outback and legacy are the same platform, but not the same unibody, subframe, or anything else.  the levorg and legacy wagon are in the place that the outback was in the 4th gen."
battlewagon,28xtac,NeilOMalley,2,Sat Jun 28 08:31:30 2014 UTC,"Lights, light bar, skid plates and some more aggressive tires are the easy ones.  I don't think there is a huge aftermarket for off road parts for newer rigs."
battlewagon,28xtac,Rangourthaman_,2,Tue Jun 24 05:07:20 2014 UTC,But even with these small upgrades you could probably get very far! The outback as is is a very capable vehicle. Just don't get to crazy with the muddy paths and larger rocks.
battlewagon,28xtac,THEMCV,1 point,Tue Jun 24 08:58:59 2014 UTC,"This is pretty much the best standard answer for small upgrades. All of these serve a good purpose and are in a reasonable price range.   If I were you, I'd get skid plates first. It's a new car and what wouldn't be fun is bottoming out on a hard rock and punching a hole in your oil pan. They also make rear diff and transmission skid plates. :) I'd check out [Primitive](www.get-primitive.com)  Here are the tires that I recommend. They're inexpensive and really get the job done. :)   Lights used are commonly from Hella because they make them well, but I run Harbor Freights. :)   Here's Rally Innovation's Light bar with a better picture.

I've got my bike mounted to the roof (which actually broke later) and some gravel on the sides. I went back to the main road via a gas pipeline road and nearly got stuck, stupid me wheeling by myself. Basically some small creek crossings that were pretty easy to cross at first then I hit a small gulley maybe 3' drop on entry and a gradual slop on the exit. I got the front wheels in the water and decided I didn't want to go any farther because I didn't know how long the trail ran. Tried to reverse out at a damn steep angle and couldn't, even with the XT's LSD rear end. I ended up just deciding to truck on and it climbed the other side no problem and that was the last creek crossing luckily.

First, it came with some prodrive p7 wheels mounted with general altimax  205/50 R17.  Then I shredded one and swapped on my outback wheels with winterforce studded 195/60 R15. I had to grind down my 02 Wrx brake calipers for those to fit.  After winter was over I found the forester tires on craigslist. They are forester steel wheels mounted with Michelin defender xt 205/70 R15. I had to remove the plastic inner fenders because they were rubbing a lot as well as my rally armor flaps. After that they only rubbed on severe bumps or dips in the road.   Just yesterday I got some 5 spoke Subaru wheels with yokohoma 195/60 R15 and put them on. Will be putting the fender liners and mud flaps back on soon."

battlewagon,28sl1x,reallifedog,6,Sun Jun 22 14:43:39 2014 UTC,If that thing uses struts I'd suggest maybe fabbing some spacers from hdpe and using longer hardware on the towers. You might need to tweak trailing/control arms to reduce the impact on the geometry but I think it could work if you have a bit metalworking/automotive knowledge.

battlewagon,28sl1x,reallifedog,2,Sun Jun 22 18:33:17 2014 UTC,"Well shocks don't actually lift but if Pontiac had a taller vehicle there might be some swappable parts. The link OP posted isn't available on my phone but it would still seem spacers would be the easiest and cheapest.  EDIT: Judging by this pic spacers seem totally viable. Also completely forgot that Pontiac was GM and I'll bet there's there's something that might work, maybe check trailblazer parts(struts, LCAs, and CVs)?"
battlewagon,28sl1x,reallifedog,1 point,Sun Jun 22 19:08:05 2014 UTC,"It shares a platform with Buick rendezvous, and a few mini-vans but nothing that has lift components readily available. I thought about the early model torrent/equinox but couldn't find lift kits for that either."
battlewagon,28sl1x,wackymayor,2,Sun Jun 22 22:44:33 2014 UTC,What's the stock ground clearance comparison? That's a potential junk yard lift for cheap.
battlewagon,28sl1x,wankwagon1997,2,Sun Jun 22 22:48:10 2014 UTC,"Torrent is only a 0.7 inch more clearance, not really enough to get any meatier rubber under there."
battlewagon,28sl1x,totallymanlytears,2,Mon Jun 23 02:11:48 2014 UTC,"I mean that could be a ~4-5"" larger diameter tire(wheel wells permitting) if paired with some 2"" spacers. You could net like four additional inches of ground clearance...."

battlewagon,28r9vk,teefish1,3,Sat Jun 21 23:41:06 2014 UTC,"Here's the car's story: I wanted a spare car so I could do some major mods to my daily so I started searching craigslist for anything kinda cool and in fair shape that ran or was cheaply fixable. About 4 weeks ago I stumbled on this Lego for $800 that was stuck in 4wd and needed some love but was otherwise a good car. I bought it, fixed its problems, and started doing research on lifting it (I can't leave well enough alone). I have a friend who has a 2005 Forester and he wanted it lowered so we swapped suspension, wheels, and a few other parts. The end result was nearly 5"" of lift over the factory setup and I'm very happy with it. It doesn't eat through CVS (just took a 1200 mile road trip) like some have experienced, it handles a million times better, and it doesn't look so much like a soccer dad car.  Current mods: Forester strut lift. Forester wheels and tires, gutted grille, 4wd switch mod, 1"" lug spacers, Yakima rails and towers (junk yard steal), unknown brand safari basket (scrap metal pile at the local, dump, and really loud Volvo horns.  Future plans: SJR 6"" Lift, 15x8 Bassett steelies, General AT2s, led light bar, etc.  Glad you guys like it."

Retailed only in the North American market for the 2005 and 2006 model years, the car earned the nickname ""Saabaru"". The car's name is written as ""92X"" on its badge, but as ""9-2X"" in advertising and other texts.

As for the wheel bearing, looks pretty simple. It's not a press-in bearing, so you can do all the work yourself for cheaper than a shop. Here's a link to get you started.  http://www.mainelysubarus.com/forums/topic/9593-pictorial-wheel-bearing-guide-ea-loyale-4wd-rear/  Edit: just realized that's for the rear wheel bearing. The front may be press-in. In which case you'd need to have the old bearing pressed out and the new pressed in. It's about $25-$50 to have a shop do that around here, if you bring the parts in."

King Springs have a (not 100% on this) 30% stiffer spring rate. You'll retain your height, but have a lot better handling. You could even go for lifting springs and gain 1"".  I think this is your best option honestly. Improves off-road driving and on road driving. :)  Let me know if you have any questions! :)"
