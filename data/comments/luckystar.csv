luckystar,3c7ste,Beneathejellyfishy,2,Sun Jul 5 19:14:49 2015 UTC,"I've discussed this with the other mods off and on since I joined. First off this is and always will be a SFW subreddit. There will never be explicit content here on /r/luckystar. That said, this and the Kagami-ism post I would consider to be SFW (Questionable but no where near NSFW). But as your mod it is my duty to make sure the content is as pleasing to our user base as possible and if you feel our NSFW opinions are too lax than we need the users such as yourself to help recalibrate it.   So if you don't mind, can you express what makes something acceptable or not? I also have some examples below from older 'Lucky Pic of the Day' and 'Kagami-ism' as well as some posts from /r/awwnime (in my opinion the gold standard for SFW).  You can respond here or as a PM to me if you'd like. This goes for anyone else, any feedback for how we can better serve the community is appreciated. Do understand I'm not trying to be a jerk with this I truly do just want to know what you think makes something NSFW or SFW.  Where do you draw the line?   is Lucky Pic of the Day #421 inappropriate? on the beach eating watermelons  how about Kagami-ism #265? embarassed in an apron  this awwmine g'morning post  Are all bikinis by default nsfw or any bra strap? What about a dress or under shirt with straps (their effectively the same thing as a bra strap)  [how about this miku not enjoying a hot day from awwnime  or maybe this idolmaster cat girl from awwnime  is the official dvd cover nsfw?  Is any official KyoAni Art automatically fine? All of these are official art works LPotD #40 volleyball on the beach, LPotD #60 another at the beach, or LPotD #90 evening with konata and kagami  If any of these are considered SFW what makes them ""safer"" than this pic or the Kagaim pic from the other day?  Thanks for your feedback."
luckystar,3c7ste,Mervinator,4,Sun Jul 5 20:18:45 2015 UTC,"Woah hey! Thanks for the write-up. Lemme tackle this.   I do think that this submission and the recent Kagami-ism post are totes sfw (sfw being not actually at work, just acceptable). Yea I think theyre a bit lewd but hey, upvotes don't lie.   As far as what I think nsfw for this sub's topic would be: if anything has to be censored, by black bars or conveniently placed clothing or hands ect. But that's just my opinion. I certainly wouldn't unsub if that started to be accepted here. I'd just downvote and not look at it.   As far as your examples go:  /#421 is fine. Like its not really lewd in anyway.  That apron one... ehhh if I'm to be honest I think it's innapropriate.  The awwnime good morning post is fine. Artisticly I think it looks silly haha, but its fine. Those birds look awesome.   I wouldn't say just having a bra in the image is nsfw. I mean it's in the show. But it's not inherently meant to be sexual.   That Miku one is fine. I see nothing suggestive what-so-ever.  Ummmm this cat chick one I would say is suggestive for the same reasons as the Kagami apron one. Plus there's some extra focus on certain features on her chest.  All these beach/swimsuit ones are fine as they aren't really meant to be suggestive or taken as sexual. The only issue I have with the Kagami one as of recent (the miku one) is the fact that her rear is the focus. Now I want to make it clear, that I'm okay with it being here. I just don't want it to be my entire front page in the next few months if you can understand. But again, this is just my personal opinion. And I'm sort of the new guy around anyways. If anything isn't clear lemme know. I dont have internet so I do all this from my phone, im sure theres errors. Thanks!  Edit: I also want to say that I wouldn't consider this one nsfw. That Kagami Miku swimsuit one? Probably. Simply because of the angle. But hey, I'm most likely the odd one out when it comes to that."
luckystar,3c7ste,1tobedoneX,3,Sun Jul 5 20:39:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. My pipe dream was that you would lay out specific criteria that we could use to say Good or Lewd. But from reading through this it's more about how suggestive the image is which can be fairly subjective and difficult to judge with a hard line rule.   I would agree that the Kagami Miku bikini one is certainly one of the more suggestive images posted on this sub. You don't have to worry about that becoming an everyday thing. I can discuss with the other mods about maybe using the NSFW tag for things that are on the more suggestive end of things. Or maybe even just using Flairs on the posts themselves. That might be a better compromise so that you can still see the thumbnail and make a judgement for yourself.  Also if you do think something is inappropriate you can always message the mods or even report the image. Although if you do so just leave a reason or explanation. Because the Subreddit is so small and has so few submitters it shouldn't be too difficult to find a reasonable balance for appropriateness or at least the frequency at which more suggestive than normal images are submitted.  Thanks again for the feedback!

luckystar,3c7ste,Fragdiemilch,3,Mon Jul 6 16:07:37 2015 UTC,"Pretty much agree with this, but I didn't even think that the recent Kagami/Miku one was too suggestive but anyway, I'm fine with your opinion :D"

Edit: So basically, senpai noticed me and asked if I wanted to take over for lucky pic of the day, I said fuck yeah, and so now I'm taking over for lucky pic of the day. There's not much pressure, really, since all I gotta do is look for moe pics, which I already do on a daily basis. You'll have to bear with the occasional yuri, though. Nothing too heavy usually most of the time. Anyways, thanks for putting up with me."

luckystar,3arzy1,trnh,2,Tue Jun 23 17:18:28 2015 UTC,"In the manga there are a couple chapters about two sisters that are for all intents and purposes independent from the main cast, the Miyakawa sisters. And surprise the pink haired girl on the left is not Miyuki but the elder sister Hinata. The Blue haired girl next to Konata is the younger sister Hikage.   They made a spin off show in 2013 about the Miyakawa Sisters. MAL Link Here I've not seen the show yet unfortunately but its 10 episodes about 5 minutes for each episode. And I believe the main cast makes some cameo appearances."

Reddit admins then started shadow banning users and, banning more subreddits, and deleting posts and the whole thing got way out of hand.  the major sub that was banned that started all of this was /r/fatpeoplehate and now there is /r/fatpeoplehate2 - /r/fatpeoplehate42069 with many still getting banned.  not really a tl;dr but theres a lot that happened and thats the short of it"

luckystar,39eund,forza1123,3,Thu Jun 11 06:46:00 2015 UTC,"I personally don't have the manga but from what I've read from others here is that the anime cuts out a lot of content from just the first 4 volumes. So while it's still a great show, for the full experience I would get all the manga."
luckystar,39eund,KeyBlader358,2,Thu Jun 11 07:39:19 2015 UTC,"I'm about half way through the fifth volume (I don't read very often) but I can't answer your main question. I don't even know what year or time of the year it is in the fifth volume. So I don't really know how much of the manga is covered by the anime. There are tons of panels that aren't in the manga and there are events in the anime that aren't in the manga.  Honestly I wouldn't concern myself with how much the anime covers in the manga. Lucky Star is such a free spirit series that it almost entices you to just pick a random episode to watch or pick up a volume flip to a random chapter. It doesn't really matter because I don't need to know any context outside of whats going on in at that time.   If you are interested I'd recommend picking up the first volume, if you like it, pick up the rest. Otherwise you're out just a couple bucks and could probably sell it and get most your money back."

So now you don't have to scroll to the bottom to see the most recent one. Character and User Results. So before you could only see results for a particular contest like the March 2015 contest. Now you can see how /u/KeyBlader358 has done in all the contests by clicking on his user name within the site. Example: netidol.moe/#/user/KeyBlader358 Same for characters. So you can see how Kuroi Sensei has done in all of her attempts to be Net Idol. Example: netidol.moe/#/character/Kuroi Three times at 2nd place GRRRR so close! There is also a little reddit alien head next to user names. Clicking on that will take you to their reddit user page. Other behind the scenes changes that should hopefully make it a little faster and the code a little cleaner.   Let me know what you think about the new theme (if you don't like it tell me that too!!! all feed back is helpful!) Let me know also if you run into any problems or things that don't work.   Thanks!

luckystar,38rief,Guesty_,3,Sat Jun 6 08:58:15 2015 UTC,Saw the opening on YouTube and fell in love instantly. I would've ended up watching it regardless because I watch everything from Based KyoAni.
luckystar,38rief,IZFSLE_,3,Sat Jun 6 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"I saw the first episodes as they were put onto Stage 6, a divx site full of online pirated shows and films. I had already seen some pics floating around and I like the art style, so I got into it. It was the first anime I watched properly, then Haruhi, then a lot of others."
luckystar,38rief,Cashback-,3,Sat Jun 6 21:42:41 2015 UTC,"The Kumikyoku, as well as being interested in it after watching Haruhi - which was another thing I found due to the Kumikyoku."
luckystar,38rief,1tobedoneX,3,Sun Jun 7 13:09:35 2015 UTC,Konata and Tsukasa looked like the purple haired twins from Clannad. I saw Clannad with my family during the summer and my little 10 year old sister was the one who wanted to watch more anime. I thought Lucky Star was cute looking and it looked a bit more appropriate (sure there were a lot of innuendoes but nothing that a child could understand). My sister loved it and we started watching other MOE shows like K-On.
luckystar,38rief,BioOrpheus,2,Thu Jun 11 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"Uhmm let's see, it was during my ""second wind"" for anime (2007-2010) since I had taken a sort of break the previous two years. I had just started college and was watching Haruhi. I was talking on AoL Instant Messenger with this guy I had met on a cruise ship a couple years earlier and we were talking about the Haruhi dance. He then was like you should check out this new show 'Lucky Star' it's made by the same people and has a really catchy dance as well and linked me a video to the OP. Shortly after torrented Lucky Star and watched it during Christmas Break 2007.   I loved it so much that over the next couple years I bought all the dvds including the OVA and the manga as they came out in English (to be fair I got a lot of them as gifts for Christmas/Birthday). I also joined the Kagami Shrine on MAL back when those things were popular. It's always been to me that show I go watch when I'm down and depressed or had a shitty day. Just grab a dvd from the shelf randomly and enjoy."
luckystar,38rief,Mervinator,2,Sun Jun 7 16:18:23 2015 UTC,"Hi, my name is FomorianKing and- oh, this isn't an AA meeting. Well, you could have fooled me.  As for how, I watched it a bit when it first came out, before I knew what ""anime"" was in comparison to ""cartoons"". Not because I was wee, but because I didn't give a shit. I was playing TF2 and Halo 3, and a bunch of other sequels that vastly outclassed their predecessors, not nitpicking the origins of animation.  Anyway, years later, I ended up using anime like a veteran uses drinking, so moe was a natural choice for decompression, though I'll be shot before I say I like yuri. Naturally, I finished K-On and was feeling a bit lost, and a wayward episode of G Gundam reminded me that I still hadn't finished rewatching Sailor Moon and that other Japanese cartoon with schoolgirls who liked garish hair dye. What was it called? Oh, right. Lucky Star.  Good God, I've watched so many Zero Punctuation videos lately, that I've started to type like Yahtzee speaks. Need to lay off."
luckystar,38rief,FomorianKing,2,Sun Jun 7 02:06:14 2015 UTC,though I'll be shot before I say I like yuri   you'll come around.
luckystar,38rief,FomorianKing,3,Sun Jun 7 04:04:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've had people telling me that and recommending shows that would win me over for five years, with what some could say was the opposite effect."
luckystar,38rief,FomorianKing,2,Sun Jun 7 04:11:05 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. I think the issues I have with yuri/romantic anime--btw I'm totally fucking biased because I really hate those genres--are the completely ridiculous drama and angst, and the plots that move at glacial speeds, relying on stupid misunderstandings and miscommunication to stay afloat. It's all insanely melodramatic stuff aimed at teens (sometimes feels like the target audience is age seven); shit that most mentally-stable people over the age of 20 wouldn't consider worth shedding a tear over.   I really only like yuri/romance/etc in small amounts--either a minor plot point that doesn't distract from the main plot, or have it not present at all. Example: the one true otp, our very own konakaga. You get to have your cake and eat it; enjoy a nice, laid-back moe anime, and when it's over, expand on the virtually non-existent yuri.   If I'm gonna watch a yuri/romance, I'd like there to be some semblance to reality... Or at least have it be entertaining. I've yet to find something like that outside of manga though."
luckystar,38rief,FomorianKing,3,Sun Jun 7 05:46:33 2015 UTC,"What keeps yuri out of my free-flight zone is the fact that I am a straight male, so yuri romance is like watching a pair of sectoids communicate via telepathy about the sports teams of their home planet, in that it is a totally alien concept being addressed in a totally alien way between two totally alien beings. Thank you, but I'll take some relatable characters now, like Kumin from Chuunibyou, who is incredibly relatable (despite being a high school age girl), because I too am a lazy little shit."
luckystar,38rief,Mervinator,2,Sun Jun 7 06:08:33 2015 UTC,What's your take on that show? Is it worth binging?

You could probably get that for around 100 on ebay, and yes it is dubbed.   I would shell out that 100 dollars for sure, since I love this show enough. But, the reason I haven't is because Funimation rescued the license back in August of 2014. I have no idea when it will be released from them, but it will come eventually and possibly even on blu-ray."
luckystar,33tqea,IZFSLE_,2,Sat Apr 25 16:55:49 2015 UTC,If Bandai is out then who gets the money spent on DVDs? Only the dubbers?
luckystar,33tqea,anoneko,2,Sat Apr 25 19:17:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like that would still kill the loot stash, anime blu-ray sets seems to be in the hundreds as well -_- but a new release of LS would still be sweet : )"
luckystar,33tqea,Mervinator,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:32:55 2015 UTC,Thats really interesting I didn't realize Vol 6 was in a limited quality. I guess I should cherish my copy even more then. The strange thing is the price for the OVA is significantly less than Vol 6 even though the Bandai NA release was months after Vol 6. I guess there is just less demand for the OVA?

luckystar,32oq27,IZFSLE_,4,Thu Apr 16 05:53:24 2015 UTC,"These cliches about anime fans have been done to death. I don't know why College Humor thinks it's funny all of a sudden in 2015.  I agree that some fans suck most of the time (at least the vocal ones), but the people who attack anime fans because they don't fit their glorious societal standards are even worse.   As for Kagami, it's a shame she's featured in a video that lacks any wit and humor. She deserves better."
luckystar,32oq27,Mervinator,4,Wed Apr 15 21:26:31 2015 UTC,"I see what you're getting at but my future apologies for this response.That is kind of the mentality that College Humor is trying to poke fun at. They are essentially saying that a lot of anime fans take the fandom way too seriously. Which is explicitly laid out about 40 seconds into the video where the girl says ""Oh my god, relax it's just a cartoon"".  The video is trying to bring to light that one reason Anime has trouble being more popular is because the fandom itself is extremely unwelcoming. There is too much elitism. ""Subs are superior to dubs"", ""If you only watch Shounen's you're just a filthy casual"", ""You haven't seen [insert generic classic] but think No Game No Life is the best anime ever fucking newfag!"" or ""OMG RWBY AND AVATAR ARE NOT ANIME!!""  The video is less making fun of the stereotypes surrounding anime fans or trying to make a point about fans meeting any sort of societal standards. It is instead trying to drive home the point that the biggest problem with anime is that many fans (unintentionally) drive off any casual and or potential new fans because of some bullshit elitist belief that they will 'muddy the purity of the industry'.  I'll look on the positive side and instead of being ashamed, I'll give them props for having good taste :p haha. Honestly kind of surprised it wasn't Haruhi though."
luckystar,32oq27,IZFSLE_,4,Thu Apr 16 05:52:36 2015 UTC,"To be honest myself here, I didn't have that mentality with my comment. I know exactly the type of fans College Humor is trying to poke fun at. I just don't think the whole fat guy with a ponytail arguing over a waifu is funny anymore. Those are the kind of cliches this video is making fun of, and that's what I mean by they're overdone cliches.  I'm all for making fun of the fandom, because like you said, the fandom has its large fair share of issues. But, my point was, it's 2015 and they should have touched on some different cliches that haven't been around forever. All I'm saying it it lacked creativity, not saying the video is wrong, but it's kind of an old joke. I guess it's like someone rick rolling nowadays and thinking it's the funniest thing. That's all.   *As for the societal standards bit, I seemed to cause some confusion with that, sorry. What I meant is, although probably not this video's intention, it lumps anime fans together. All fandoms have their quirks, and in turn you can be scrutinized for being a part of that fandom. Videos like this cause people to attack anime fans just because they are anime fans. Although anime fans aren't actually causing any problems, they are criticized because they are different, and that image gets amplified with a video like this. Heaven knows why I looked at YouTube comments, but I found this comment, and although a tad extreme, it is pretty much what I mean, just let people have their quirks if they're not causing any issues. That doesn't mean the type of fan in this video has no issues, it's just the fact that people will lump all fans together with that type of fan because of things like this.  You can see this effect at work because if I debate this video I could be labeled as defensive or the type of fan this video is making fun of. Well, that's wrong, because I'm not the type of fan this video is making fun of. If you don't believe me, look at my post history. 90% of the talk about anime I take part in is on reddit. I'm not a loudmouth, and I don't look to attack others' opinions. I leave people be and I'm pretty low-key. It's just that when I point out some things with this video, I could be labeled the opposite for whatever reason."
luckystar,32oq27,UnrelentingCake,2,Thu Apr 16 14:57:31 2015 UTC,"At the end of the video, the girl goes ""Anime is great, its just the fans that suck"".  But let's be honest, the stereotypical weeaboo is very rare (the closest thing I've seen IRL was people wearing naruto headbands, but they were totally self-aware).  Most anime fans are normal people, and anime tends to have a lot of ""stealth-fans"" that don't reveal to others that they're into it.  The few weeaboos that do exist get a disproportionate amount of attention compared to their size.   Also, most anime fans are casual.  While sub > dub gets repeated a lot, its recognized as personal preference, which generally comes down to how well the dub was done.  Speaking of subs, most people will watch whatever subbed version they find first, even if theres subjectively better alternative subs.  If you look at sites like MAL, ratings tend to be very inflated compared to even IGN, and anything that has a MAL score lower than 7.5-7 is considered god awful.  Elitism exists, sure, but it shouldn't be stopping anyone from joining in the medium.  Other popular hobbies like Music, Vidya Games, Books, and even TV shows and Movies have hardcore elitist hobbyists, and I'm sure that extends to other things too like sports.  Yet, despite this, those things are very popular.  Anime isn't mainstream due to problems like poor marketing and niche appeal, not because of its fanbase.  On another note, I haven't watched many CH videos since... 2010?  Are they still funny?"

luckystar,31kc21,potato_dude,3,Sun Apr 5 22:36:16 2015 UTC,"After scanning the episodes, the reference for point 1 is Episode 6 at about the 12:50 mark (timing may be different depending on your source)  Thats an interesting theory I'd not heard it before. Another piece of evidence that is just as flimsy, if Yui and Yutaka's mother is Kanata's sisters, than it can also be believed that Yutaka most likely has the same illness. Seeing as she is described as weak, frail, and sickly just like Kanata was. Also short.  Also I know this isn't Lucky Star but another great Slice of Life comedy shows, 'YuYushiki' has an interesting dark fan theory as well   For anyone who hasn't seen it, I'd recommend it. It's a lot like Lucky Star although less otaku and reference, a little more yuri overtones, and a little more goofy and carefree.   Yukari is so adorable  sharing is caring  wait what sub am i in again?"
luckystar,31kc21,Mervinator,3,Mon Apr 6 02:06:35 2015 UTC,It's amazing how perfectly these theories fit because I'm sure the creators had nothing of the sort in mind when making both series. Pretty neat coincidences.  It's pretty weird to see these two shrouded in darkness all of a sudden though. They both happen to be two of my absolute favorites. I recommend Yuyushiki as well for anyone who hasn't seen it. The three main girls have incredible character dynamics and the show is all around a lot of fun.
luckystar,31kc21,IZFSLE_,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:39:09 2015 UTC,"It's a lot like Lucky Star although less otaku and reference, a little more yuri overtones, and a little more goofy and carefree.   Sounds a lot like Azumanga Daioh. Another great slice-of-life and one of the first anime I ever watched. If you haven't seen it i highly recommend it. It aired a good 4 or 5 years before Lucky Star. It's basically the same as you described YuYushiki, but it is suuuuper mellow. Good for when you want a light but goofy midnight anime.  I've never seen YuYushiki but I'll give it a try for sure. :)"
luckystar,31kc21,cooldude22345,2,Mon Apr 6 03:25:32 2015 UTC,"Here's my theory:   I always figured Kanata didn't die of some genetic illness; rather, her frail build (which made it hard enough for her as it was) complicated her pregnancy, and after Konata's birth her health worsened. Maybe that's why Soujiro absolutely wouldn't approve of a boyfriend for Konata, because he's afraid the same thing might happen to her.  And that's why Kagami and Konata are otp."
luckystar,31kc21,Fragdiemilch,2,Mon Apr 6 04:59:23 2015 UTC,"So, I thought about that already and I've seen something similar... My ex-girlfriend had a condition wich has lead to a small growth during puberty. A lot of peole have mistaken her for a 12-year old while she already was 16. She had mutiple surgerys and needed to visit the hospital every half a year because the doctors needed to check her condition. So was small, VERY slim at times and looked kinda, well young.The reason for that was that her esophagus sphincter wasn't working properly. Normally this muscle opens if food needs to get to the stomache but that wasn't the case so that it would took a very long time that the food would be processed so that she could not eat a lot and would not have enough energy for the development of her body. The doctors kinda helped the muscle by cutting it open a bit (wich was one hell of a surgery) but even then she only could gain a few kilos. I think it would fit to your theory but some things don't quiet fit. On the one hand she had her period already but it was weak. On the other hand nobody in her family has this disease... However her puberty was affected by that disease a bit. For example she only had very small breasts and her face looked a bit young too :/ So maybe Konata had that disease. Unfortunatley I can't tell you the name of that disease because I can't remember it and I don't have any contact with her anymore. So maybe I have extended you theory? ^"
luckystar,31kc21,Derpy2015,3,Mon Apr 6 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"Wow. Yea this could be a definite possibility. Maybe she has that, plus a frail immune system. Just like her cousin."

luckystar,2znrky,Mervinator,2,Fri Mar 20 02:51:32 2015 UTC,Baton's are the things you hold when racing relay races. Those aren't batons (source 10 years of competing in track and field) but instead I believe those are the tubes for diploma's or certificates you see at graduation ceremonies in anime. I have a Toradora poster with the characters holding similar looking tubes.  This is a pretty unique and interesting art style though. Almost looks like it might of been somewhat watercolor or something.

luckystar,2vrg0h,Beneathejellyfishy,2,Fri Feb 13 14:05:57 2015 UTC,"Well for clarifications, this was not done by Shaft. (I just couldn't come up with a good title haha).   But Shaft is well known for taking certain liberties with their artstyle. Shaft is most known for animating Madoka Magic, the Monogatari franchise, and Nisekoi. Akiyuki Shinbo is kind of the big name at that studio and is fairly well known. One of the things they are known for is commonly called the 'Shaft Head Tilt' which is not exactly what Kagami is doing in this picture but I was trying to allude to.  But yes I agree this art style is very unique and it would be cool to find more work like this. Might have to go digging around this weekend for some more."

Other than the standard channels of contacting Viz I wouldn't know how to go about convincing them. Other members may have some ideas so feel free to openly discuss available options. Speaking personally, as long as they translate and release in some form Volumes 9 and 10 I'd be pretty happy. Print release preferable but digital would be sufficient as well.  Sorry we can't be of much help, maybe some other members might be able to contribute some good ideas. You could also try providing a little more information such as how many members are in your group, links to your site/forum/etc... and maybe a brief overview of what you have tried or are planning on trying in regards to contacting Viz.  As for your other question on submissions. MLG basically means Montage Parody Heres a Know your meme on the phenomenon.

I thought it would be a great idea to hang it up in my room (that I SHARED with another person) and let my fellow drumline people come to our room to visit.  They saw the poster and wondered what the hell was wrong with me  This is the poster in question
luckystar,2qm0by,cupcakemann95,3,Sun Dec 28 19:48:01 2014 UTC,I so totally want that poster.

luckystar,2qm0by,Mervinator,3,Mon Dec 29 02:16:10 2014 UTC,"the first time i watched lucky was when i was in 6th grade on poorly done dubs back who knows what year it was in. (im wrapping up highschool now) i didnt know why i was watching it, i just kinda did. soon enough, my brother for some crazy reason checked all the links on our family computer's history. he found those dubs and was like ""wtf is this bullcrap."" i was never found out but i guess my whole family just figured it was me."

Theres a bunch of links in that thread some are better than others. And also some discussion on details. This link is probably the most helpful link we will find  I haven't had time to give it another try though. In the team coders thread there is a lot of good information as well.   To give you a break down of where we are at. We've broken the ISO into it's components and broken down those pieces into further components. We think we have identified which file has the script. But when using a hex editor on it it is all gibberish. There might be a byte shift being applied to it. Essentially we need to take this file and be able to get it into it's japanese form because right now the hex editor just looks like random garbage.   I have been able to modify a file, zip it all back up into an iso and start the game which then crashed at a certain point because of the modified file. So that's a fairly good sign."

I'm making this change because we have had a bunch of new subscribers since the 'Lucky Pic of the Day' was started and even a big increase since I started 'Kagami-ism'.   So every couple days I plan to post a small album of 5 pictures from one of the daily picture series. That way some of the older pictures are being shown for our newer members without them having to scroll through dozens of pages. I will choose a random group of 5, so the next group might be 101-105. Nothing will be posted in this series that was already posted in the last month.   So to kick things off Here is the first 5 'Lucky Pic of the Day' pictures originally posted by /u/KeyBlader358!  I was toying with the idea of just posting one image every day but with a small album I could get through a lot more pictures in a shorter time.  Let me know what you think!"

Other subbers have that as the subtitle here.   and   KxK Fan Service? :3   The actual subtitle from that clip says    I want us to join our bodies~   and the final annotation   I think Tsukasa's reaction was the funniest part of the whole OVA   I don't know if I've actually watched my physical OVA disk so I don't know how they have it subtitled.

luckystar,2ltlaw,Mervinator,3,Mon Nov 10 02:43:57 2014 UTC,TL;DW: Lucky Star is amazing.
luckystar,2ltlaw,KeyBlader358,2,Mon Nov 10 04:35:16 2014 UTC,"This video is pretty neat. It may sound weird to say this, but Lucky Star is a modern Shakespeare. Shakespeare did stuff involving his time, like how in Romeo and Juliet it's going on during the plague. It works in my highschool classes because we learned about the plague so we were informed about, just as if someone who watched haruhi (history class) watched luckystar (shakespeare's works). I know the plague wasn't going on when Shakespeare wrote it, but if you asked some random European about the plague every single person would know anything and everything, and that's what luckystar was trying to do.   And if not, Romeo and Juliet is still a neat story with these sad and funny moments, that in today's time might not seem sad or even remotely funny. Just like in luckystar, they make funny jokes, but if you don't have the context you might not get it, or it's just funny because it went from this gentle show to FZero. Just like the car scene he talked about. I never knew what it was from, but I still thought it was funny.   Luckystar was my 4th anime I watched back in 6th grade on bad YouTube dubs and I thought it was great because I could relate to the nerdy girl with all her normal friends ""wtf""ing her. Shakespeare did that too, starts off with a guy who's lovestruck, and some guys could be like ""I'm like that too, maybe this story can help me/this story is cool and I want to find out what happens because he reminds me of me."" Saying ""some guys"" might be a tiny audience, but lovestruck people in the Renaissance were pretty common. (Or really before social interaction was as easy as it is today.)  tl;dr luckystar is written by shakespeare  If you've ever read Shakespeare and been like ""this is crap,"" you should get some context. Many kids at my school hate it but in reality he has some of the greatest things ever written. The teachers just don't know what this guy knows, so it's hard for the kids to like it."

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in Ryoo High, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on cosplay cafes, and I have over 300 completed assignments. I am trained in gorilla studying and I’m the top student in the entire Japanese school system. You are nothing to me but just another otaku. I will flunk you the hell out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my stinking words. You think you can get away with saying that crap to me over the Internet? Think again, ass. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of shrine girls across Japan and your summer break is ending right now so you better prepare for school, slacker. The school that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your grades. You’re freaking flunked, kid. I can study anywhere, anytime, and I can lecture you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed studying, but I have access to the entire arsenal of manga and dating sims at Konatas house and I will use it to its full extent to fail your flunkie ass off the face of the continent, you little otaku. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your freaking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you stinky idiot. I will shit homework all over you and you can’t copy it. You’re freaking flunked, kiddo."""

luckystar,2k9w9m,kagami77,6,Sat Oct 25 09:24:43 2014 UTC,"Some quick thoughts on the event:  -The official site for the event: http://www.wasimiya.org/birthday/  -Lucky Star is definitely one of my favorite anime (as my username reveals), and is probably the major reason I ended up moving to Japan, so going to these events is always really exciting for me  -Unfortunately, Kagami/Tsukasa's birthday fell on Monday this year, so I had to skip school to celebrate >_>  -Washinomiya Shrine is in Saitama, about 2 hours by train from where I live in Shinjuku, so I left first thing in the morning  -I'd been to Washinomiya several times before, but the first few pictures are shots of the city you can see in the anime (Washinomiya Station, the bridge crossing) and of all the anime-related ema at Washinomiya Shrine  -As always, there are a lot of Lucky Star itasha/itachari, but I didn't take as many pictures of them as I should have  -The first event of the day was to all eat cake together at the small restaurant on the shrine premises. All the restaurant's sliding paper doors were replaced with Lucky Star paper, and it looked very pretty.  -The second event was a scavenger hunt, where five Lucky Star figures were hidden around Washinomya City, and if you found all of them, you could be entered in a lottery to win prizes. This event was VERY hard, as although Washinomya City isn't a particularly big city, it's still not that small, although two of the figures (Konata and Tsukasa, the last two I found) ended up just being on the shrine grounds.  -The next event, the main event of the day, was a talk event with Fukuhara Kaori (Tsukasa's VA) at the Washinomiya Community Center. Unfortunately, Kato Emiri wasn't able to make it this year, although she sent in a letter (delivered by the humongous Kagami costume). They say they are making a Tsukasa costume for next year. After the event, everybody took a panorama picture together with Fukuhara.  -After walking together back to the shrine, Fukuhara sliced the big Kagami/Tsukasa birthday cake, and the winner of the lottery got to take the first bite (not me)  -After the day was over, I went with a couple people I met at the event to Kyouei High School (the Lucky Star high school), which is the picture at the end of the album. There is this really huge onsen complex right next to the high school (lucky, Kagami and Tsukasa must have been able to go there often), and I had a nice, traditional onsen dinner there.  -As a final note, Washinomiya City's local government takes Lucky Star promotion very seriously, and most of the city is decorated with Lucky Star flags and such (not just on Kagami/Tsukasa's birthday). You can find some of the exclusive goods they made here: http://www.wasimiya.org/goods/ http://www.wasimiya.org/sourse/"

luckystar,2jrm59,wiibros220,4,Mon Oct 20 13:11:17 2014 UTC,"Describing the picture, it was a collage of gifs. In the middle was a small gif of Snoop Dog surrounded by a couple ak47s. To the left was a gif of halloween character dancing that looked like it was from a Tim Burton film. In the bottom left was a gif of some sort of worm frog that was dancing with flashing colored lights. The bottom middle contained a gif that flashed a creepy smile, some people, and what looked like some sort of surgery operation. Minami was posted on the right side with a soda can and the Illuminati triangle over her face. There were a few other images collaged on there that I can't particularly remember.  It was decided to remove the picture mostly because it didn't actually spotlight Minami enough. There were small objects covering her face and there were other larger gifs on the opposite side effectively diverting the viewers gaze away from Minami. Also the gif near the bottom of the image I thought could be borderline graphic. All in all it was an interesting attempt but we determined it wasn't quite fitting for Net Idol. I think if it was to be posted normally than it would be fine.  If anyone doesn't agree with the disqualification or has any input at all regarding the image, please do contact the Mod's and let us know why.

luckystar,2jg46z,MilkTeaForMee,1 point,Thu Oct 16 22:33:14 2014 UTC,"Ultraman:       Ultraman (ウルトラマン, Urutoraman ?) is a Japanese Tokusatsu television series that first aired in 1966. Ultraman is a follow-up to the television series Ultra Q, though not technically a sequel or spin-off. The show was produced by the Tsuburaya Productions, and was broadcast on Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) from July 17, 1966 to April 9, 1967, with a total of 39 episodes (40, counting the pre-premiere special that aired on July 10, 1966).  Although Ultraman is the first series to feature an Ultra-Crusader, it is actually the second show in the Ultra Series. Ultra Q was the first. In fact, Ultraman opens with the Ultra Q logo exploding into the Ultraman logo. Ultraman ultimately became a major pop culture phenomenon in Japan. The show's success spawned dozens of sequels, spin-offs, imitators, parodies and remakes.  To distinguish him from subsequent characters named ""Ultraman"", Ultraman is referred to as the Original Ultraman (初代ウルトラマン, Shodai Urutoraman ?), the First Ultraman, or Ultraman Hayata; this last is a reference to his host's surname.

Kagami's has the two pockets, some embroidering in the torso, and a small belt/tie through the middle. Also I have a feeling this one wraps around her body a little more. The frills though are spot on.  Also, side note, high school of the dead was disappointingly bad.  EDIT: Actually the more i look at it, I'm not sure if Kagami is wearing an Apron or if it's actually some sort of dress."
luckystar,2h82ym,snivell,2,Wed Sep 24 03:28:44 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't know! If I watch it, it's got to have more than fanservice, or none at all."
luckystar,2h81f2,KorStonesword,4,Tue Sep 23 12:28:57 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I would say that your view or scope of a Tsundere might be a little too ""tight"". Terms like Tsundere or other words that are used to describe the personalities of characters need to be kind of soft and fuzzy (from a definition point of view) because characters are complex and difficult to describe. Honestly some of the best tsundere characters are the ones who are kind of on the fringes of being a tsundere because they are well written and deep. Aisaka Taiga from Toradora is a great example, she is widely considered a tsundere yet doesn't truly fall into that archetype. She is violent and sharp while also being lovey dovey but not by tsundere definition. Being that they are sharp or violent in order to try and hide their true feelings. Taiga in Toradora is just violent in general and not because she is hiding her feelings.   Kagami I do think is a Tsundere but again she doesn't fit the archetype to a T. Like you said, she tends to pull the Tsun side not because shes trying to hide her true feelings but because she was insulted or calling someone out on their bs. She also overtly doesn't express the dere said mostly because there really isn't any kind of love interest. Konata just pokes at Kagami I think more too get a rise out of her then actually projecting love. Kind of like how siblings would push each others buttons solely to get on their nerves. And despite all the implied yuri love interest stuff between konata and kagami, I think it's mostly blown out of proportion and not supposed to be taken seriously.   In closing, I think Kagami is a tsundere but not because she strictly fits the archetype but more because the actual usage of these archetypes are actually quite fuzzy in order to be general descriptors for complex characters."

luckystar,2h81f2,Mervinator,2,Wed Sep 24 13:04:31 2014 UTC,"Aisaka Taiga from Toradora is a great example, she is widely considered a tsundere yet doesn't truly fall into that archetype.   But Taiga is about as Tsundere-ish as it gets (and I hated her, btw). The physical abuse, her seeming really harsh and over time (poorly) developing to be nicer, everything about her fits into the stereotype almost to a T. Also, Taigi is was violent in general, but then the show completely removes that aspect which is pretty inconsistent with it's plot (she completely stops being harsh or hitting during/after christmas arc). Also it's more in that case that she has a kind side to her, but doesn't properly know how to express her feelings.   A Tsundere usually is defined as: ""Its is a character trait given to those whom express alternating feelings of hatred and love for a particular character, often one who is their secret love interest or crush. The usage of tsundere has expanded beyond its literal definition, however, and it now generally describes any character that has alternating hot-cold feelings for another person or group of people, whether those people be of platonic, romantic, or familial relationships. ."" Which Kagami doesn't really have. As I mentioned before, in the context of another show where she would be surrounded by more realistic characters, she wouldn't really be a Tsundere at all. She's only a Tsundere within the context of the show itself, and this is more due to her realistic behaviors around characters that generally act unrealistic or just stupid in general. (Not that I didn't like them, Konota ftw!)   despite all the implied yuri love interest stuff between konata and kagami   Firstly, I'm not exactly sure how that was relevant. Second, I really did not see any of that present at all, and I dislike implied yuri (main reason I dropped non non biyori)."
luckystar,2h81f2,1tobedoneX,1 point,Tue Sep 23 15:07:12 2014 UTC,"Well the yuri comment was relevant because there are a lot of fans that believe that Kagami and Konata love each other and that Kagami's dere side is focused on and in reaction to Konata. If you didn't notice it in the show then there isn't much for me to say at the moment about it. I'd track down some examples but I'm currently at work. I for one don't mind it. Yuyushiki was awesome and it had a little more yuri overtones than Lucky Star but not as much as Yuru Yuri (presumably, I haven't actually seen it yet) and no where near what Sakura Trick is. Anyways that's not the point. The point is the yuri hints are supposed to elicit the lovey side of Kagami from the Tsundere definition.   Not relevant but how did you hate Taiga, she's great. As for here Tsunderish qualities I point you to this video where the narrator expresses my views pretty well. Only the 40 seconds after the 3 minute mark. The thing is everyone assume her violence is directed solely at Ryuuji hence her being labeled a Tsundere but she is just generically violent  to numerous characters throughout the show and is from the beginning labeled a trouble maker and violent outsider.   Which goes against the definition you listed above which says ""feelings of hatred or love for a particular character""  And yet on the flipside I feel like what you quoted above more accurately represents Kagami than Taiga. Kagami acts reasonably normal around everyone with the sole exception being Konata. And Kagami really only has the ""hot and cold"" flip flops with her mostly because Konata knows how to poke Kagami's buttons. And again this is where the hinted love between those two characters try to sell home the idea that Kagami is a Tsundere.   I mean sure you can say that if she was in a different show where there wasn't someone to push her buttons the way Konata does than her tsundere hot/cold tendencies wouldn't be exhibited, but that's a fairly irrelevant argument. Moving characters around like that changes a lot of things including to some extent who they are. I mean even in real life, had I hung around with group x instead of group z I'd be a very different person now. And that just cracks open an entire philosophical can of worms about whether or not you are actually an aggregation of everyone's perception of you or whether it's an internalized projection of who you think you are."

luckystar,2gi8ey,Ericman100,4,Mon Sep 15 23:03:53 2014 UTC,This is a brilliant summary of the Net Idol.
luckystar,2gi8ey,Mervinator,3,Mon Sep 15 23:42:46 2014 UTC,"""I just want a flair.""   I am pretty sad right now.  Source is not safe for work.  I should be getting back to my crying.  I wanted Flair...  If you can't tell, I am in a bad mood.    The Link that couldn't.  Flair please."
luckystar,2gi8ey,wiibros220,4,Mon Sep 15 23:04:00 2014 UTC,Me too but i can't get one because of konata…..
luckystar,2gi8ey,1tobedoneX,3,Mon Sep 15 23:05:48 2014 UTC,I made a strawpoll thing...  NOTE: IF YOU ARE A MOD PLEASE FLAIR ME!
luckystar,2gi8ey,snivell,6,Mon Sep 15 23:08:49 2014 UTC,Flair will be coming soon.  Measured in Valve Time.
luckystar,2gi8ey,snivell,1 point,Mon Sep 15 23:49:51 2014 UTC,Well...  Can I have a flair while I wait?
luckystar,2ggibv,wiibros220,5,Mon Sep 15 13:45:39 2014 UTC,Yep so Today i badly drawn Minami.  Original Pic: http://i.imgur.com/HANjOFm.jpg
luckystar,2ggibv,Mervinator,3,Mon Sep 15 13:46:25 2014 UTC,Best one yet
luckystar,2ggibv,Ericman100,2,Mon Sep 15 23:43:06 2014 UTC,Here is a simple picture of Ayano.
luckystar,2ggibv,FomorianKing,4,Tue Sep 16 02:55:19 2014 UTC,Improving... Continue.
luckystar,2gft7i,cupcakemann95,4,Mon Sep 15 06:53:29 2014 UTC,"I even started late~ chuckles  So now Konata is known as Net Idol supreme champion, and there is nothing you can do to stop her! muahahaha"
luckystar,2gft7i,MaJuBo,3,Mon Sep 15 12:31:06 2014 UTC,Gratz to winner! Love getting to see all these awesome Lucky Star pics :D
luckystar,2gft7i,1tobedoneX,3,Mon Sep 15 17:01:52 2014 UTC,I didn't do well last time with a cute image so I thought I'd mix it up a bit. <\3 but now I'm running low on Minani fanart so I have to choose someone different next time. (Probably Yutaka) congrats cupcake
luckystar,2gdild,cupcakemann95,5,Sun Sep 14 15:44:34 2014 UTC,I keep pressing the up vote button but nothing is happening!
luckystar,2gdild,jwyche008,4,Sun Sep 14 16:42:40 2014 UTC,The reason nothing is happening is because reddit is trying to add all of the upvotes you added.  You can expect it to be around the thousands range soon.
luckystar,2gdild,Ericman100,3,Sun Sep 14 18:09:22 2014 UTC,"Well, Reddit is just now calculating everything."
luckystar,2gdild,1tobedoneX,4,Mon Sep 15 11:30:20 2014 UTC,Can someone please tell me why everything is tagged as net idol?
luckystar,2gdild,xxHikari,5,Mon Sep 15 00:09:16 2014 UTC,We are doing a monthly contest called Net Idol. Basically each person at the start of the week picks one of the characters. Everyone who signed up goes and finds their best picture of that character and posts it at the start of the weekend. On Monday the Net Idol Post with the most upvotes wins the title of Net Idol for the following month.   The Name Net Idol comes from the Lucky Star PSP game called Net Idol Meister.  If you have any more questions please feel free. We'd be happy continue to clarify any further confusions for you. And maybe next time when we have the Net Idol contest in October you can participate as well! :)
luckystar,2gdild,Mervinator,4,Mon Sep 15 00:59:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I work way too much so I didn't really know about this. Thanks for clarifying everything. Personally, I love Misao, so maybe next month I'll be posting!"
luckystar,2gdild,xxHikari,5,Mon Sep 15 01:04:53 2014 UTC,The net idol thingy!  See this post for details
luckystar,2gdild,xxHikari,4,Mon Sep 15 00:58:12 2014 UTC,Thank you. I work too much and must have missed that.
luckystar,2gdild,Ericman100,4,Mon Sep 15 01:03:14 2014 UTC,I guess I lost.  Can I still have a flair?
luckystar,2gdild,1tobedoneX,3,Mon Sep 15 03:50:18 2014 UTC,...GG.
luckystar,2gdild,Mervinator,3,Mon Sep 15 10:18:44 2014 UTC,"Late start, let's see how much ground you can cover. That is an awesome pic though"
luckystar,2garfc,Guesty_,6,Sat Sep 13 16:40:53 2014 UTC,/u/Guesty_ has posted his contestant!  And the crowd goes wild!
luckystar,2garfc,Ericman100,6,Sat Sep 13 16:52:17 2014 UTC,My adoring fans!
luckystar,2g9an7,Ericman100,6,Sat Sep 13 02:27:15 2014 UTC,I was going to only upvote Kuroi. DAMN IT CUTE MISAO!
luckystar,2g9an7,FomorianKing,5,Sat Sep 13 02:47:17 2014 UTC,"To make up for your mistake, I guess I should give you some Kuroi."
luckystar,2g9an7,FomorianKing,4,Sat Sep 13 03:03:39 2014 UTC,"Thanks, mate."
luckystar,2g9an7,KeyBlader358,4,Sat Sep 13 03:12:47 2014 UTC,"I have been saving this picture from when I started the When I feel like it Misao.   Also, I am keeping this source hidden in this comment...  Source  This source is not safe for work.   This source also contains things that are not safe for your heart.

luckystar,2g9an7,1tobedoneX,5,Sat Sep 13 02:27:19 2014 UTC,This is Net Idol. Upvotes DO matter!
luckystar,2g9an7,1tobedoneX,5,Sat Sep 13 02:49:23 2014 UTC,"I guess they do then...  Speaking of things that matter,  Will you take this Quiz?"
luckystar,2g9an7,Mervinator,4,Sat Sep 13 03:15:33 2014 UTC,...........I surrender to you...  jk
luckystar,2g9an7,1tobedoneX,3,Sat Sep 13 03:57:58 2014 UTC,Prepare to crumble.   (Due to Moe.)
luckystar,2g944v,Mervinator,6,Sat Sep 13 01:05:33 2014 UTC,She's MINE!
luckystar,2g944v,FomorianKing,3,Sat Sep 13 01:13:52 2014 UTC,"I'll fight you for her mate! Fight to the death, best 2 out of 3."

luckystar,2g944v,FomorianKing,3,Sat Sep 13 03:15:47 2014 UTC,Now she'll get all the Christmas cake.

luckystar,2g87e3,Ericman100,2,Sun Sep 14 00:46:38 2014 UTC,How heretical.

luckystar,2g7u2m,Ericman100,1 point,Fri Sep 12 17:26:10 2014 UTC,Here is Yutaka thanking Minami.
luckystar,2g6zpg,wiibros220,3,Fri Sep 12 12:06:30 2014 UTC,can I repost this as my Konata submission?
luckystar,2g6zpg,cupcakemann95,3,Fri Sep 12 22:31:42 2014 UTC,fine but if you win we both get the tags since it was originally mine.
luckystar,2g6jyz,Dirst,3,Fri Sep 12 07:23:08 2014 UTC,"I'm afraid I don't really like this contest format... Discourages upvoting more than one contestant if you have a favorite. That said, upvoted them all."
luckystar,2g6jyz,Dirst,5,Sun Sep 14 03:48:42 2014 UTC,"We're currently looking at ways to improve, such as a poll. However it was too short notice to implement anything new for this month's contest. So expect a new voting system next month."
luckystar,2g6jyz,Ericman100,4,Sun Sep 14 04:05:21 2014 UTC,"You could try using Strawpoll, which is great for this sort of thing."
luckystar,2g6jyz,Mervinator,3,Sun Sep 14 04:19:19 2014 UTC,I did make this...  It isn't that good...  But it could get the job done.
luckystar,2g6jyz,Ericman100,3,Sun Sep 14 04:23:44 2014 UTC,I upvote all of them as well because I feel it wouldn't be fair as a contestant.   If you have any suggestions on ways to improve we would certainly be interested in any ideas you have.
luckystar,2g6jyz,Guesty_,3,Mon Sep 15 01:02:06 2014 UTC,I have posted mine!  Proof!  Also /u/Guesty_ is quite busy with other things.  What will he do?
luckystar,2g6jyz,Ericman100,4,Sat Sep 13 02:29:50 2014 UTC,"Post best girl, obv!"
luckystar,2g6jyz,1tobedoneX,3,Sat Sep 13 16:40:21 2014 UTC,There is a reason I am subscribed to /r/hiyorimasterrace.
luckystar,2g6jyz,1tobedoneX,3,Sat Sep 13 16:53:35 2014 UTC,What happens if there is a tie?
luckystar,2g5phv,Ericman100,5,Fri Sep 12 00:59:35 2014 UTC,What exactly is the game here?
luckystar,2g5phv,FomorianKing,3,Fri Sep 12 01:06:22 2014 UTC,"The Pocky Game.  ""A game where you eat Pocky.""  That is about all I know.   It is also pretty cute..."
luckystar,2g5phv,FomorianKing,3,Fri Sep 12 01:30:24 2014 UTC,"It's got a Lady and the Tramp type feel, which is a red (yuri) flag in a show as innocent as this."
luckystar,2g5phv,FomorianKing,3,Fri Sep 12 01:33:08 2014 UTC,Some of Konata's comments aren't innocent...
luckystar,2g5phv,FomorianKing,2,Fri Sep 12 02:22:24 2014 UTC,But she's an exception to the rule. A cute exception.
luckystar,2g5phv,FomorianKing,3,Fri Sep 12 02:24:07 2014 UTC,"Sojiro's comments are also not so innocent...   However, he is awesome.   Some Yuri here and there is okay.  Also have this picture."
luckystar,2g58oj,FomorianKing,8,Thu Sep 11 22:06:14 2014 UTC,Johnny Bravo   I'm okay with this.
luckystar,2g58oj,Mervinator,5,Fri Sep 12 00:20:23 2014 UTC,"Holy cow, impressive findings! And that is an awesome figurine!"
luckystar,2g58oj,1tobedoneX,6,Fri Sep 12 01:24:46 2014 UTC,Then some random Johnny Bravo...
luckystar,2g58oj,surfgavin,5,Fri Sep 12 02:03:02 2014 UTC,"Here's another figurine (sorry, on mobile can't hyperlink) http://www.amazon.com/Guhico-Lucky-Star-Display-Figure/dp/B005NIXUNI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1410472840&sr=8-2&keywords=Minami+Iwasaki I would get this one if I had money. please someone hire me"
luckystar,2g58oj,surfgavin,3,Fri Sep 12 02:21:23 2014 UTC,Well. Mobile has failed me once again. This should be correct link... http://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Star-Iwasaki-Uniform-Version/dp/B003VQS5ZC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1410488580&sr=8-4&keywords=minami+iwasaki
luckystar,2g58oj,jwyche008,3,Fri Sep 12 02:24:07 2014 UTC,Sorry op but I liked her better when she was on Azumanga Daioh and her name was Sakaki.
luckystar,2g58oj,jwyche008,3,Fri Sep 12 01:43:29 2014 UTC,"I can't choose who's better, so let's tie? <3"
luckystar,2g4zo2,1tobedoneX,8,Thu Sep 11 20:45:18 2014 UTC,Thank you for your service Guesty. We'll always be grateful for what you've done for this sub and you're always welcome back at anytime.  Don't worry about flair. I'll figure it out somehow.
luckystar,2g4zo2,Mervinator,6,Thu Sep 11 22:38:06 2014 UTC,"Sayonara, /u/Guesty-san, and thanks for the basis of the themes of /r/LuckyStar, /r/StrikeWitches, /r/ShuffleAnime, /r/Kanon, /r/SquidGirl, and probably others that are missing. Well, it's either this, or the boring old /r/Naut theme."
luckystar,2g4zo2,Ericman100,5,Fri Sep 12 02:17:00 2014 UTC,Thanks for all the hard work you've put forth! It is truly appreciated by all of us!
luckystar,2g3l6e,Mervinator,6,Thu Sep 11 12:55:17 2014 UTC,Embarrassed tsundere best tsundere.
luckystar,2g3l6e,FomorianKing,2,Thu Sep 11 14:30:33 2014 UTC,Every tsundere best tsundere.
luckystar,2g3l6e,Ericman100,2,Fri Sep 12 02:24:05 2014 UTC,Even dead tsundere that met yandere?
luckystar,2g3l6e,FomorianKing,2,Fri Sep 12 02:25:42 2014 UTC,"As long you have some revives or 1-up mushrooms.   Otherwise...  Expect sadness or regret.  You did bring the revives, didn't you?"
luckystar,2g3l6e,Ericman100,3,Fri Sep 12 02:39:51 2014 UTC,"No, sir. This is my yandere. She has proven her worth by eliminating all other competitors for my attention swiftly and efficiently. No amount of my love shall be given to a tsundere, dandere, deredere, kuudere, or himedere that cannot defend herself in hand-to-hand combat."
luckystar,2g3l6e,FomorianKing,2,Fri Sep 12 02:44:24 2014 UTC,What about Hand-to-Nunchuck-Gun combat?  Is it okay if she loses? (And is still alive.)
luckystar,2g3l6e,Ericman100,3,Fri Sep 12 02:56:16 2014 UTC,"My yandere does not leave loose ends. All potential suitors are terminated with extreme prejudice. She is competent with kitchen knives, unarmed combat, anti-materiel rifles, environmental combat, chainsaws, and hatchets. She is the ideal partner. she's watching me help I can't say anything against her"
luckystar,2g3l6e,FomorianKing,2,Fri Sep 12 03:09:40 2014 UTC,"She sounds like a nice person.   With all of those skills, she could be a murderer butcher.   Will send help and food."
luckystar,2g3l6e,Ericman100,3,Fri Sep 12 04:26:29 2014 UTC,"She has elected not to pursue a career, in order to ensure my continued safety, which is quite admirable. She sits on the bathroom floor when I shower"
luckystar,2g3l6e,FomorianKing,2,Fri Sep 12 04:40:32 2014 UTC,"She seems like she might a great person to have around the house!  Also, it is quite nice of her to protect you.  I am going to sleep now..."
luckystar,2g3l6e,Ericman100,3,Fri Sep 12 04:51:50 2014 UTC,her face reminds me of chizuru from shinryaku ika musume http://i.imgur.com/aZy3rrI.jpg
luckystar,2g3l6e,Ericman100,2,Fri Sep 12 03:26:36 2014 UTC,It was inspired by it.  I think the guy who drew this likes Squid Girl.  Have the Source that is not safe for work!
luckystar,2g3l1y,Mervinator,4,Thu Sep 11 12:53:40 2014 UTC,Titles are TOO overrated for things this cute.
luckystar,2g3l1y,1tobedoneX,3,Thu Sep 11 21:01:36 2014 UTC,Did she just wake up on the sub?
luckystar,2g3l1y,jwyche008,2,Thu Sep 11 21:37:37 2014 UTC,"The title should be, ""Way too adorable""."
luckystar,2g3qh3,wiibros220,6,Thu Sep 11 13:57:03 2014 UTC,This time i took my time and decided to go slow so i took 3 min to drawn and 1 to color it in so it can slightly look nice.  Congrats to Ericman100 on his Painting of Misao!  If you want me to add your art to the next RSD PM me the pic.
luckystar,2g3qh3,Ericman100,2,Thu Sep 11 13:59:01 2014 UTC,Here is my best drawing ever.  I am so proud of my work...  Hang it up in a museum.

luckystar,2g2cye,Ericman100,3,Thu Sep 11 02:02:29 2014 UTC,I would make the title what she is saying...  But I can't copy and paste that text...  Source: Not safe as always.    I'll post the link now...
luckystar,2g2cye,Mervinator,3,Thu Sep 11 02:02:33 2014 UTC,at first from the thumbnail I was thinking she was wearing a yellow bow and got really excited :(
luckystar,2g2cye,Mervinator,2,Thu Sep 11 02:54:04 2014 UTC,I tried.
luckystar,2g295o,Ericman100,6,Thu Sep 11 01:24:11 2014 UTC,For once I am useful!  This is Mirakurun from Majokko Mirakurun (Actually Yuru Yuri)
luckystar,2g094i,Mervinator,7,Wed Sep 10 14:17:27 2014 UTC,The way she's colored and posed makes me think of the design of the characters in yuyushiki http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Yuyushikicover.jpg
luckystar,2g094i,Ericman100,4,Wed Sep 10 15:53:31 2014 UTC,I love yuyushiki! And I want a second season! Yukari is so adorable
luckystar,2g1o0g,MaJuBo,3,Wed Sep 10 21:56:32 2014 UTC,Here is mine...  Not safe for work if your workplace doesn't like anime.  I should post some of these.
luckystar,2g1o0g,Ericman100,3,Thu Sep 11 02:16:35 2014 UTC,"please post them, that was hilarious"
luckystar,2g1o0g,esmth,3,Thu Sep 11 03:12:52 2014 UTC,whoa that was awesome haha
luckystar,2g092c,Mervinator,3,Wed Sep 10 14:16:51 2014 UTC,Now we have enough chocolates for 4 people.  Or everyone could have a 0.007-th of a chocolate.
luckystar,2g06gg,wiibros220,6,Wed Sep 10 13:47:46 2014 UTC,"So basically what I'm going to do is i have 1-2 minutes to draw a picture and i will post my my drawings onto here everyday, so starting here i will and try to develop into ""fan art"""

luckystar,2g06gg,Mervinator,3,Wed Sep 10 13:49:39 2014 UTC,I spent 15 minutes on this.
luckystar,2g06gg,Ericman100,3,Wed Sep 10 15:01:26 2014 UTC,"Well there is certainly room for improvement, but that's why we practice right? I can also say I know exactly what scene this is from so good job on that. If it was just the head it would be pretty solid."
luckystar,2g06gg,ProfessorHooves,3,Wed Sep 10 14:21:43 2014 UTC,The arm is incredibly funny however!

luckystar,2fygfd,KeyBlader358,5,Tue Sep 9 23:48:45 2014 UTC,psst. Try using the direct link. It loads faster.
luckystar,2fygfd,KeyBlader358,5,Tue Sep 9 23:57:27 2014 UTC,How do I use this magic?  Am I just too stupid to figure it out?
luckystar,2fygfd,1tobedoneX,4,Wed Sep 10 00:10:27 2014 UTC,Put an i. before imgur.com than put .jpg after.  Example: http://imgur.com/FFXteLJ vs http://i.imgur.com/FFXteLJ.jpg
luckystar,2fygfd,1tobedoneX,4,Wed Sep 10 00:14:20 2014 UTC,"Either that, or start using RES. From what I learned outside the realms on Anime Subreddits, RES makes indirect Imgur links turn into Direct links."
luckystar,2fygfd,anoneko,5,Wed Sep 10 01:08:17 2014 UTC,Sick huh... You and me both brother.
luckystar,2fygfd,dingo785,4,Tue Sep 9 23:59:26 2014 UTC,"Yeah. I also feel sick at random points. Most of the time it's just a little cold (possibly due to house dust although I'm not a doctor), but I usually have other things going on at random times. Fall is the season of my sicknesses."
