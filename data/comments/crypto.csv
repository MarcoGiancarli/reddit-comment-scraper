Lets assume the most draconian type of 'banning encryption' possible - where users are only allowed to send plain text to one another and everything else is banned.  You could take a locally encrypted binary string (that was encrypted with strong encryption) and hide it in plain ascii, pick characters who's last bit match the bit you want to send. Each binary character would be encoded into a single character and it would be pretty simple to make the ascii say something readable and also decrypt it on the far end."

crypto,3dz285,R-EDDIT,10,Mon Jul 20 18:16:17 2015 UTC,"Why, oh why, did they have to use a reduced round AES.   Now rather than using the fast, optimized, tested, implementation provided by the OS, I have to write my own slower, buggier, custom version.  From an implementation and trust point of view, I liked that Scrypt is simply PBKDF2 with an expensive way of generating salt. I get to use an OS supplied primitive. And no matter what, it is at least as secure as PBKDF2 with the original password and salt.  With this, there is no existing primitive I can use.  And they need to, quickly, define a good string serialization format.  $ar2$400409....   I don't like the fact that the ""secret K"" is stored in another place. The virtue of Bcrypt/Scrypt is the ease of implementation because it's self contained.  They don't specify how many bytes I should be generating for password storage. Most Scrypt implementations output 64 bytes, for no particular reason than 256 bits is more than enough - so double that (64 bytes) must be ever better.  Simplify. Standardize. Specify the unknowns. Otherwise we'll have to come up with our own incompatible versions (c.f. Scrypt implementations)    Edit: I wanted to clarify some things. Scrypt is basically still PBKDF2 as a key-derivation function, but uses their own custom memory-hard algorithm (BlockMix + ROMix + Salsa/8) to generate the salt that you feed into PBKDF2:  https://i.imgur.com/6RrXnqU.png  This is extraordinarily useful, because it lets us re-use existing, optimized, trusted, operating system provided, hardware accelerated, algorithms for some grunt work. This leaves Scrypt/Argon2 to focus on their own task: memory-hard custom hashing.  Internally the Scrypt magic is:   BlockMix which is a wrapper around ROMix which is a warpper around Salsa/8   And all that had to be custom implemented, and hand optimized. That's fine, and that's OK. And if Argon2 has their own primitives, that's fine too:  https://i.imgur.com/CzyZxsG.png  The only thing that caught my eye in their custom stuff was how they used AES somewhere in there.

I meant use PBKDF2 for the final task of generating bytes.  I also was referring to the fact that Argon internally uses AES, but a reduced round variant. Don't use a reduced round variant, use the normal variant.  They can continue to use their custom hashing, memory avalanche, mixing, fast memory fill custom hashing algorithm. But when it comes times for me to have to perform AES make it the AES that i can access from either the CryptoAPI or CryptoNG api (or .NET if i was in C#).  Same can be said of any key derivation algorithm. I didn't look at anything but Argon. But i assume they are all Key Derivation functions, rather than (strictly speaking) password hashing function. For all of them you can use PBKDF2, but use your custom, expensive, way of generating salt.  It's kind of like how Bcrypt is a modified blowfish.

Generating keys from password hashes requires only a simple loop and a regular hash function. No need for additional dependencies and unnecessary operations. If the password hashing function is broken, the security will be reduced to the security of the hash function. I don't think the HMAC construction of PBKDF2 adds any additional security in this area.  If you still want to use PBKDF2 you can of course just compute a regular password hash into and then generate keys from it by using PBKDF2.   custom, expensive, way of generating salt   I'm not sure if we should use the word salt here. Because salt implies a public value. Using the output of the memory hard function as the salt parameter of PBKDF2 also has the disadvantage of requiring an additional passphrase(first parameter of PBKDF2). If this passphrase is the password or a direct derivative, an attacker can gain a significant advantage when being able to read parts of the memory (remember heartbleed).The way scrypt does it, makes it vulnerable against garbage collector attacks: https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/881   Rather than being able to use existing AES, for an AES operation, i would not be able to use AES, becuase i have to create a custom AES.

If you don't grant select access to your keys table, then the website process account would be unable to know what the keys are. That way all encryption has to happen either at the client's site.

You seem to lack important knowledge in this field as you clearly forgot important parts, e.g., authentication. It would be better for you to use TLS with certificate pinning and a fixed cipher suite.

Some particular problems with this protocol:   RSA and AES need padding and modes to be secure. Lack of authentication. Lack of forward secrecy. The server will need to store an ever-growing list of previously used session IDs.  Usually practical protocols don't use this sort of ID unless they really need low-latency operation, and in that case they include a timestamp or something to prevent the list from growing forever. Any violation of the protocol, including a duplicate session ID, should be a hard error unless you really, really need to do otherwise. Encrypting a key with itself is a no-no. The AES encryption mode for packets will need nonces (probably the packet counter and direction, so you don't have to transmit them unless you're over UDP or similar) and MACs.  Probably you should use an AEAD mode. Appending the session ID is pointless unless perhaps you're over UDP or similar. If you're over UDP or some other unordered/unreliable protocol, you need to include facilities message ordering. Probably a bunch of other things.

The basic idea is that nobody gets physical access to the cryptographic keys, not even the owner of the HSM. Instead, you get an API (usually PKCS#11) to interact with the keys without needing to know the bits that make up the key.

Where homomorphic encryption deal with the notion of the privacy of the data being computed on, homomorphic signatures deal with the ""dual"" problem, authenticity of some computation on data. Let us briefly discuss what we mean by homomorphic signatures, as it is not as intuitive as homomorphic encryption. As opposed to digital signature schemes, where there are only two parties involved, here, there are three parties involved.  In a homomorphic signature scheme some trusted party can sign some dataset X. If someone, lets say Alice, is given the dataset and the signature of the dataset, she can compute arbitrary functions y= f(X) on the dataset, and homomorphically derive a signature σ(f,y) that certifies that y is the correct output of the computation f(X). Anybody, lets say Bob, can then verify the tuple (f, y, σ(f,y) ) using a public verification key, without the need to ever have access to the dataset X.  I hope this explains the concept of homomorphic signature schemes a bit. Otherwise take a look at the article ""Leveled Fully Homomorphic Signatures from Standard Lattices"" by Vaikuntanathan et. al."

Oh wow! That's amazing!   The attack sends a few carefully-crafted ciphertexts, and when these are decrypted by the target computer,   Oh, nevermind.   they trigger the occurrence of specially-structured values inside the decryption software. These special values cause observable fluctuations in the electromagnetic field surrounding the laptop, in a way that depends on the pattern of key bits (specifically, the key-bits window in the exponentiation routine). The secret key can be deduced from these fluctuations, through signal processing and cryptanalysis.   I read this research a while ago. It's a great topic that deserves attention, however, this is not a practical attack in the real world. Fixes for side channel attacks have been swift in most implementations recently. I think we're keeping up with the technology on this one.   As a concrete example, Enigmail (a popular plugin to the Thunderbird e-mail client) automatically decrypts incoming e-mail (for notification purposes) using GnuPG. An attacker can e-mail suitably-crafted messages to the victims (using the OpenPGP and PGP/MIME protocols), wait until they reach the target computer, and observe the target's EM emanations during their decryption (as shown above), thereby closing the attack loop.

crypto,3cmow3,ryanknapper,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:45:46 2015 UTC,"Van Eck phreaking:       Van Eck phreaking is a form of eavesdropping in which special equipment is used to pick up side-band electronic-magnetic emissions from electronics devices that correlate to hidden signals or data for the purpose of recreating these signals or data in order to spy on the electronic device. Side-band electromagnetic radiation emissions are present in, and with the proper equipment, can be captured from keyboards, computer displays, printers, and other electronic devices.  Van Eck phreaking of CRT displays is the process of eavesdropping on the contents of a CRT by detecting its electromagnetic emissions. It is named after Dutch computer researcher Wim van Eck, who in 1985 published the first paper on it, including proof of concept.  Phreaking is the process of exploiting telephone networks, used here because of its connection to eavesdropping.  Van Eck phreaking might also be used to compromise the secrecy of the votes in an election using electronic voting. This caused the Dutch government to ban the use of NewVote computer voting machines manufactured by SDU in the 2006 national elections, under the belief that ballot information might not be kept secret.   In a 2009 test of electronic voting systems in Brazil, Van Eck phreaking was used to successfully compromise ballot secrecy as a proof of concept.

crypto,3cjx74,ASsghosthauntsEP,11,Wed Jul 8 14:19:05 2015 UTC,"A note here that historically (20 years ago) we were in much the same location, where encryption was regarded a military export and subject even within the United States to controls that kept communications to levels where law enforcement could intercept communications.  The 'crypto wars' as they were known were believed to be 'won' by cryptographic professionals as the legal status of encryption was deemed to be a right to free speech and hard work was done to thwart proposals by the government (under the Clinton administration) to enforce that civilian cryptosystems rely on unexaminable ""Clipper Chips"" that allow US government access but deny criminals.  What Snowden and new technical analysis have revealed is that, while granted a legal right, the US government went about making it a practical difficult possibility - they backdoored not only encryption standards and kept security advancements from the industrial sector but worked to backdoor code, obtain secret keys across the PKI, instituted laws that allowed third party and computer services to be subject to tap-and-trace laws (CALEA, etc) meaning any service like Google or the cloud or backup or Skype was made observable by law, and the Clipper Chip evolved into the Trusted Platform Module which now resides is most private civilian computers.  Provided this history, we need to be careful that the legal outcomes are associated with technical outcomes and that there are not gaps and loopholes in the law that enable extremely broad collection or weakening of encrypted communications.  In doing this we also need to take the federal government serious about their concerns: when they say that encryption prevents them from fighting terrorism they are speaking about the global surveillance systems disclosed by Snowden. It is important to know that PRISM and phone surveillance was just the surface content of the Snowden documents and that these programs, which evolves from the Total Information Awareness programs, collect everything from constant geolocation, biological markers (fingerprints, gait identification, faces), voice over the internet, public internet posts, financial information, emails, etc, etc. It is important to know that analysis programs run over this 'metadata' is used to process sentiment analysis and look for the spread of ideas so that anti-American narratives and so called 'extremist' (traditionally 'jihadist') ideas can be blocked, discouraged and the lines of communication killed.  If communications become encrypted this large scale social media and sentiment analysis can not be done and so the databases can not be used to curtail and track the spread of ideas.  We need to balance these concerns with our own private rights. We need to perform a calculus where we ask how much we would like the US government to direct the flow of ideas for our safety and national security versus our individual rights to private conversation. We must also ask whether there are ways to solve the problem of the spread of anti-American ideas without using global surveillance and propaganda tools."

crypto,3cjx74,seattlyte,3,Fri Jul 10 02:48:46 2015 UTC,"If communications become encrypted this large scale social media and sentiment analysis can not be done and so the databases can not be used to curtail and track the spread of ideas.   You're going beyond basic observation to active participation. There are several things to layout first. First of all, these programs provide enormous leverage to those who have access to the databases. When the databases are abused, it becomes leverage. This is known, and the system considers that these abuses are outweighed by various far more threatening goals. For example, say a corrupt LE organization/institution/group etc abusing the system to target individuals for extortion/racketeering/criminal activities and offenses etc under guise of their position is considered far less dangerous than say terrorists using the networks to orchestrate attacks. These is considered 'justified' collateral damage.  That was very brief in assessing abuse of the system, conceptualizing its risk and cost, against the supposed intent of the system. The political jabber is something akin to, ""A few hundred or thousand people being consistently exploited by those with access to the system is far less damaging than tens of thousands consistently attacked by some nasty terrorist 'activity'""  Now let us consider this intent. The intent of the system is meant to provide a means to track terrorist activities by its attractive force as an available communication channel for terrorists to use. If the risk of their operations is magnified by use of the system, or their operations are hindered by use of the system, then they won't use the system and/or their activities will be obfuscated even further. It is easy to dismiss this as ""It's because Snowden"", as it is as easy to correctly assess that they are only using Snowden as a scapegoat to their failure. This is then a contradiction in the purpose of the existence of this system.  Next is active participation. To 'halt and control the spread of ideas' is definitely one that could be used in satire. The state has no right in ""controlling the flow"" of ideas because they think it's ""harmful"" and this breaks basic fundamental law of Freedom of Speech. The satire would basically be that the existence of this system to ""protect by controlling speech"" is much more damaging than it is justified."
crypto,3cjx74,rflownn,2,Fri Jul 10 06:34:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed that abuse of any nation state capabilities including prison (delayed use of force), weapons (force), intelligence tools (spying/leverage/theft/sabotage), legal capability (harassment), etc is a bad thing and needs to be avoided. There are a lot of good reasons to worry about NSA surveillance capabilities being abused.  Unfortunately this is a large conversation in and of itself. It's an important topic - but I think one that needs to happen after there is a discussion about the existence of capabilities in the first place. I.e. we do need to take the debate on the terms of that national security folk, imagining that there are processes that can mitigate and contain the abuse of power. Or at least, if you've lost all faith in that, bear with me for this thread in the short term as a hypothetical.   The intent of the system is meant to provide a means to track terrorist activities by its attractive force as an available communication channel for terrorists to use.   Sort of. The national security folk want to be able to track the spread of ideas to get early warnings about upcoming revolts and to understand how ideas 'infect' areas of the world. Then, tools can be used also to encourage or discourage the infection of ideas in certain places and to encourage and discourage revolts, etc.  The problem for national security folk is if large or important portions of communications become private. In this case the large scale analysis can not be done.  In this sense it is not always enemy combatants who are using communication technology considered a target. It is potential enemies and civilians who are potential enemies or who give collective signals about mass social unrest. These folk want privacy for their own reasons but if large or important pieces of the public citizenry get encryption then the spread of jihadist/salafist ideas (for example) can not be tracked and engaged.  I think it's great that you have a strong opinion about the active participation in the control of the spread of ideas. The US government does not recognize free speech of those who are not Americans, and they also maintain that they have the right to be influential - either by hiring PR people or by posting anonymously to message boards, etc. It's a fuzzy area of law, and definitely something we should be having conversations about. Again I think it's great that you have strong opinions here."

So, yes, I am making a prediction - but a correct one. Approximately 0% of web servers have been attacked using this, as yet undisclosed, vulnerability.  And I predict that approximately non-zero percent of servers will be attacked after the details become known.    I don't know why i am so concerned about educating people on the Internet.

NY Time: Study Finds No Evidence of Heartbleed Attacks Before the Bug Was Exposed  Ever since the Heartbleed bug was exposed last week, the question everyone has been asking is: Did anyone exploit it before a Google researcher first discovered it?  To date, they’ve witnessed 41 unique groups scanning for and trying to exploit the Heartbleed bug on three honeypots they are maintaining. Of the 41, the majority of those groups — 59 percent — were in China.  But the attacks began only after the Heartbleed bug was discovered on April 8. The computer scientists have also found no evidence of any attacks before the disclosure, and they say it’s impossible to tell if the scans came from real hackers or other security researchers trying to look at the problem.   I have started to learn that if i come across some piece of interesting trivia, i need to copy it, and save the original url. Security companies do maintain logs of traffic, so they can go back and examine it after the fact. Unfortunately i cannot find the article now. So i cannot back up my fact with sources. But i believe it was Kapersky who went back through their traffic logs and found no evidence of the exploit at the time existing in the wild.

ICSI uses a /23 network, for which we had access to 30-days of full traces from April 2014.  NERSC has a /16 network, for which we analyzed traces from February to April 2014.  The EC2 honeypot provided full packet traces starting in November 2013.   For all four networks, over these time periods our detector found no evidence of any exploit attempt up through April 7, 2014. This provides strong evidence that at least for those time periods, no attacker with prior knowledge of Heartbleed conducted widespread scanning looking for vulnerable servers   Which is interesting, i didn't know that Amazon EC2 maintains a honeypot.   6.2 Post-disclosure Activity  To detect post-disclosure scanning, we similarly examined packet traces from LBNL, ICSI, and the EC2 honeypot.

It is possible to define addition, and by extension multiplication, on these elliptic curve points.   This is somewhat mathematically inaccurate, as multiplication is not defined on the curve (i.e. you cannot multiply two points). You can, however, multiply points by integers.

crypto,3cee0z,apetersson,5,Tue Jul 7 16:48:02 2015 UTC,"It is effectively point-to-point utilizing PGP-style encryption.  Think IPSEC tunneling between devices, but utilizing DNS servers for key lookup and routing, instead of being pre-configured.  This does not replace CAs in the sense that a stolen cert would still need to be able to be revoked should it become compromised.  However, it appears that in its current state, the keys are self-generated and there is no chain of trust for validation.  Should a key be stolen, one could effectively intercept all traffic to the intended device, particularly since the supplied DNS server doesn't have any way to validate an entry.  From what I can gather, there is still a lot that needs to be done to make this a truly secure system.  They touch on the DNS part a little bit here: http://trustiosity.com/snow/how-to-use.html  It wouldn't replace Tor, since traffic would still be point-to-point and wouldn't be anonymous, but it eventually could be used to transparently encrypt network traffic from beginning to end without having to do a key exchange across all devices on the internet, which is an exciting thought."

Not shown above is how snow maps keys to unknown ""real"" IP addresses. The general idea is to have some other machine(s) relay the information and then verify with the public key. This conveniently allows snow to do automatic NAT traversal by using the same relay to coordinate UDP hole punch.  The current relay implementation uses an overlay network with DHT-style routing. This has the advantage of being completely decentralized at the cost of having to rely on potentially unreliable third parties. In the works are an improved overlay routing method that should provide better performance and more resistance to denial of service, and the option to specify a preferred known-reliable relay.""   http://trustiosity.com/snow/how-it-works.html"

That being said, the direct communication between nodes is not, inherently, an anonymity-breaking feature. Nodes in a DHT are not the same as 'users.'   Nodes are always going to know the IPs of other nodes when 'sending messages to one another.' That is either an inevitability, or you are going to have to offload that process onto a TOR-like network. Your network is never going to be able to scale to the size you say you want on the TOR network, and if it did the anonymity would be broken anyways. I think you have some misunderstandings about how DHT's operate. Nobody can be identified because no node can tell where a message originates from.  If I communicate with John, who will transmit the message to you, he does not know that I'm not simply another link in the chain to you. This is the best 'anonymity' you are going to achieve. Any more than this can NEVER be Sybil-proof.  Edit: Twister's blockchain-based IDs are transient and the best option for your network. You mitigate impersonation and still allow for very cheap/fast distributed identity verification."

Addresses could be made of fucking lolcats in this scenario, because it's really just a server doing the routing for them.

Here's more info on that: http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/ccs10-lookup.pdf  Now you are correct in that it can be done. Here is one (not implemented, purely academic) solution: http://hatswitch.org/~nikita/papers/octopus-icdcs12.pdf  Bitmessage is an example of a p2p network that can (at least in theory) hide IPs from both sender and receiver.

If NSA doesn't know a weakness in your cipher, or in all ciphers (eg, P=NP), then 256 bits is just plain infeasible.  See Schneier's Applied Cryptography:   [These numbers] strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit [symmetric cipher] keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.   He didn't consider quantum computers in his analysis, but even if NSA can build them, a cluster of THz linear quantum computers running Grover's algorithm for a century only give a savings of 270 or so.  So it turns from ""an ideally efficient cluster of computers would exhaust the energy in the galaxy"" to ""an ideally efficient cluster of THz quantum computers would exhaust enough energy to boil Earth's oceans dry every few hours for a century ... just for the program counter"".  I understand the urge to add a stupidly huge key size for folks who want to overengineer.  Maybe it adds some extra defense if your cipher turns out to be weaker than you hoped.

For starters, the design of MD5 (and SHA-1) are based on a well studied design criteria.  Essentially MD5 (and all other MD hashes) is a block cipher where the message is the key and the IV is the plaintext.   There is a paper from the early 90s that examined 64 variants of CBC (and other) modes in order to create a hash function.  Where MD5/SHA1 (and MD4) failed is that along with not being that secure as a cipher their key schedule wasn't that strong against related key cryptanalysis (something that wasn't really invented by then).  MD hashes came out of countries other than USA.  While MD4/5 and SHA1 are American RIPEMD and TIGER/192 aren't and neither are the scores of other MD based hashes that were broken soon after coming out.  You're looking at a 20+ year old algorithm and then applying a 6 month old attack to it and saying ""see look they backdoored it!""  You could apply that 20/20 vision to most any engineering failure and say ""see look they intended for your ABS to fail because they should have known about this flaw in the design that only came out 8 years later...."""

My point is that, as well as software (open-source), the hardware and protocols/standards should be open and developed all over the world. And not just favour USA standards as if they are the best.

Then for authentication they run 1 more iteration of PBKDF2 on the encryption key using the passphrase as a salt and ship that off to the server to login.  Is this a good idea?

All of the finalists should be better at defending against current threats than PBKDF2. Most finalists support key derivation and some additionally support server relief. You could either combine the two modes or run them separately.  Make sure that you hash again on the server, because in this scenario it becomes the plaintext password. This threat is not overly severe because it's unlikely that another service uses the same settings for client-side hashing, whereas passwords are often reused between multiple services, but in general it's consider a bad move to simply save whatever the client uses to authenticate.  Imho it's a bad move to use the passphrase as a salt on the client, because it keeps the client from purging the passphrase any sooner.

Generate a salt and hash the password+salt in the browser with a password hash (PDKDF2, scrypt, etc.) with a fairly high difficulty. Encrypt user's data with that hash code. Hash the hash code again with something faster.  Send that ciphertext, hash code and salt to the server, and hash it again there with a faster hash; store the output.  To auth a user, repeat the same process and check equality with your stored hash to see if the user is legit. Then, you can serve them the encrypted data and they can decrypt it.  You never see the user's key, since it is hashed before they send it to you. If someone compromises your DB, they won't have the user's key since it is hashed. Additionally, they can't even authenticate to your server to receive the stored ciphertext, as the hash sent from the browser is not the same as the one stored.  You're protected from rainbow tables by the salt, from brute force by the password hash, and you don't have to worry about your server getting DoS'd by someone submitting a bunch of garbage to be scrypted server-side.

crypto,3bvje2,icStatic,-2,Fri Jul 3 14:59:10 2015 UTC,"Here is my 'work in progress' attempt at achieving this for a project I'm working on. I am still in the process of validating it, but it might be a useful starting point.   As we assume that the server may be compromised or under surveillance, we require that the server not know the user’s password. To reduce the risk of password recovery if a database of hashes is stored, each account password is uniquely salted. Unfortunately this poses a problem to the login process because the password must be comparable to successfully authenticate.  To work around this issue, we provide a two stage login process. The first stage asks the user to authenticate with a ‘salt key’, which is an 8-byte truncated PBKDF2 HMAC.  The algorithm used to generate is as follows: innerHash = PBKDF2( HMAC-SHA1, uname + pass, saltSaltKey, 1000 iter, 256b key ) innerHashTrunc = innerHash[0:7] saltKey = SHA256( innerHashTrunc + sessionSalt )  This is sent along with a hash of the username (SHA256, with a salt specific to usernames), and the sessionSalt (a cryptographically random 256b value).  If the server is able to verify that this key matches the expected value, it will return the salt used to encrypt the password on the server - this salt (userSpecificSalt) was generated by the client and sent to the server during registration.  If the secure connection between the client and server is snooped during this exchange the attacker will learn the salt used to hash the password, but the password itself will remain secure.   Now that the client has the salt needed to generate the same password as the server, proper authentication is able to begin.  Again a similar process is used to generate a password hash: innerHash = PBKDF2( HMAC-SHA1, saltPassword + uname + pass, userSpecificSalt, 1000 iter, 256b key ) passwordHash = SHA256( innerHash + sessionSalt )   AUTHOR NOTE: The author is concerned about the use of a specially crafted salt from the client that could cause the server to incorrectly validate with an invalid password. It is also possible that a malicious server could return a specially crafted salt that could cause the client to reveal the user’s password. Investigations into ways of preventing either attack are required.   Again the client then sends the passwordHash along with the sessionSalt used to generate it and the hash of the username to the server.  The server then signals authentication status as either a pass or fail.  If authentication succeeds then the server responds with a session token that the client can use for future exchanges.   EDIT: Note I am also considering using public key encryption as mentioned by /u/tom-md. For context, the reason why a public key was not used previously is that all this work is done in javascript and I found the generation of a reasonable sized RSA key was too slow. I am planning to revisit this at some point."

You aren't ga  Also, dieharder appears to be for analyzing PRNG/PRF. Not block ciphers.  Am I correct in saying that the SBox is used 8 times each round? Given that this is a balanced feistel network with 3 rounds, back of the envelope says you should need 6.277 * 1057 plaintext/ciphertext pairs to crack it using linear cryptanalysis.  Not bad, but then, that's because you just copied one of the best SBoxes currently used in modern crypto...  You should need 8.968 x 1052 pairs to crack it with mod3 crypto.  Increasing the #rounds would make it more secure, as always.  Your cipher is just a standard implementation of a Luby-Rackoff feistel network where the round function is derived from an SBox.

I worked from the assumption that if my f64()  function isn't random enough, the cipher is obviously broken. So I've tested output of the cipher and output of this function, both with reduced rounds, to check if it could distinguish them from random. It couldn't.  Each call to f64() results in 4096 calls to f8(), if R constant is set to 8. So, it requires 8192 accesses to S-box. If R is 3, then f8() is called 216 times per round of cipher's outer layer, so 432 accesses to S-box."
crypto,3bqla5,SirRobertKiN,2,Thu Jul 2 07:40:00 2015 UTC,"12 round AES has 192 sbox lookups, so the security of your feistel network is really just because of the high number of subrounds.  It's interesting though. I'm not that familiar with Feistel networks, but maybe you could get a linear approximation of multiple subrounds of your round function...

Motivated by some analogies between cryptographic and dynamical systems, in particular with chaos theory, we propose an algorithm based on Lyapunov exponents of discrete dynamical systems to estimate the divergence among ciphertexts as the encryption algorithm is applied iteratively. The results allow to distinguish among six modes of operation, namely ECB, CBC, OFB, CFB, CTR and PCBC using DES, IDEA, TEA and XTEA block ciphers of 64 bits, as well as AES, RC6, Twofish, Seed, Serpent and Camellia block ciphers of 128 bits.

This would generally only ever happen with a very gigantic file. Example, if someone sends you a 4GB encrypted file, and you haven't 4 gigabytes of memory free, there isn't any place to put that except writing it to disk. No different from what PGP or any other asynchronous system would do in the same situation.  As for ""silently"", it would be easy enough to add a popup alert telling the user this is about to happen, and give them the option to cancel.

The exception is receipt of an extremely large cipher-file (containing say a 4GB pdf file) where the decrypted content is too large to be held in memory, and has to be written somewhere so that it can be accessed.  In such a case, re-encrypting that data to disk with a temporary AES key would serve little purpose. The recipient already has the cipher-file in full encrypted form, somewhere on disk in its original location (from which it was loaded into CenoCipher). If one has chosen to Decrypt, it needs to be transformed into plain-data so that the message and files can be accessed.

Thing is, you can't really know which ones to distrust except the most obvious ones (e.g. CNNIC if you don't live in China or Staat der Nederlanden if you live in Netherlands and need the state's e-government sites to work).   If you distrust the wrong certificates, things may start to fail silently if a site exchanges issuing CA for one you distrusted (I've learned this the hard way). Especially if it's for a connection that is not the toplevel site in URL bar (you won't get warning if loading of some resources from a CDN fails because of this).   Our software vendors can push new Root Certificates in automated updates without anyone knowing about it.   I think this applies to Microsoft, maybe Apple (not sure about the latter). In case of a typical linux distro you can see that stuff like ca-certificates or similarly named package is updated and can check changelog. I'd guess this is true for *BSD OSes.  Lastly, I think the threat of abuse CA for MitM attack is overinflated. Yes, it has had happened - Comodo, Diginotar, GlobalSign, then few corporate subCA MitM certificates. But that's fairly limited compared to malware attacks.  From what we have seen, it's much more likely that your machine will get owned by malware (targeted attack like Finfisher, drive by, etc.) It's simpler to bypass encryption than to attack it.  The Snowden docs seem to confirm this as well. They rather exploit unencrypted traffic, misconfigurations or weak keys. Keys are more often stolen than broken. The really nifty crypto stuff is limited for state-level targets (think Flame).  Finally, let's recap technologies and protocols that were created to prevent CA abuse for MitM:   Perspectives - still lives, but not useful for checking on Google farm (too many certs) Convergence - dead TACK - dead Sovereign Keys- vaporware DANE - won't really spread, because DNSSEC won't spread HTTP public key pinning - new, but limited to HTTPS, we'll see how it fares Certificate Transparency - this has a chance because Google will push it   So far the best score in detecting MitM: Chrome browser, because it comes with public key pins for Google services and a few others.

Large here means like >21024 and so scanning for a valid k is infeasible.  In particular, in a group, if r is a uniformly random group element, and x is any value, then rx is uniformly random in the group as well, so as long as the chance you uniformly choose a small element is tiny, then it should be fine.  For 1024 bits, the chance you choose anything under, say, 900 bits is 2-124 which is super super small.  The correct way to analyze it is via what is known as a security reduction: suppose an attacker COULD break your scheme, then how effectively can you use the attacker to break the underlying assumption?  This immediately raises a few questions... what is ""break"", what is ""effective"", what is the ""underlying assumption""?  It turns out these aren't easy to answer for a novice, but the intuition is like this: if it is tightly reducible to the underlying assumption, then the scheme cannot be easily broken because otherwise we would have an easy break to the underlying assumption (which is assumed to be hard).  For the ElGamal cryptosystem, ""break"" means breaking in the IND-CPA or SS sense.  The underlying assumption isn't discrete log (though if discrete log is broken, so is this), but rather DDH.    However, the reduction is easy to make so I'll explain it here:  The challenge in DDH is: given public gx and gy to distinguish gxy from random. This is believed to be hard for certain groups, and these are the groups you want to work with for ElGamal.  That is to say, given (gx , gy , z), there is no efficient algorithm to determine if z is gxy or a random finite field element.  Now I can reduce the ElGamal IND-CPA game to this challenge: I publish gx as the public key, and (gy, mz) as my ciphertext, where m is the message.  If z=gxy then this is a perfectly valid ElGamal ciphertext, and if ElGamal were insecure, you can break it and recover m. On the other hand, if z was truly random, then mz is also random and thus you cannot hope to recover what m is.  This gives me an effective way to distinguish z=gxy from random if ElGamal were easy.  But DDH is hard, so ElGamal cannot be easy.  And that's how the proof goes."

Another simple scenario for data transfer is:  Sending entangled photon to the other (so the ""endpoints on the wire"" would be sent). When a snooper tags the line, it would almost be the same as if they cut the line. In this case, a simple scheme is to have each photon be one ""wire"" that sends one bit.

It's important to protect the most sensitive info from cache-timing attacks, but someone in a position to mount a cache-timing attack against a server should likely be able to tell users apart via other patterns which are impractical to conceal because they exceed the scope of crypto implementation.  It seems to me the general solution to cache-timing attacks is to strengthen the platform. It should not be possible to mount these attacks across VM boundary.

It would be a trivial change to keep around the N-th hash of the salt + password information, instead of the initial password.  I'm just not convinced of the threat of this type of attack.

For two oracle inputs x0, x1 that produce outputs y0 (= g(x0) = k XOR x0) and y1 ( = g(x1) = k XOR x1) you can see that y0 XOR y1 = k XOR x0 XOR k XOR x1 = (k XOR k) XOR (x0 XOR x1) = 0 XOR (x0 XOR x1) = x0 XOR x1. So y0 XOR y1 always equals x0 XOR x1. If the output were truly random, the probability that this holds is 2-n , I'll omit the proof...

FPH's members are arrogant bastards feeling they're entitled to special privledges.

It's simple (ignoring the explicit parallel modes). It's Sponge-based with a permutation inspired by ChaCha. There is a high degree of instruction-level paralellism in there so that's one reason why it's so fast on modern superscalar CPUs. Another is that the permutation is composed out of only 4 rounds. that surprized me and still worries me a bit. But at least they apply the permutation twice after the initialization before any of the state is used for the key stream.  I'm expecting NORX to enter the second round of the CAESAR competition -- whenever that may be.
crypto,3a9of7,dareksam,2,Thu Jun 18 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the details, but every norx round is the same as two (three?) chacha20 rounds. They copied the round function or something along those lines. Someone will have to verify it though, I can't remember"

crypto,3a9of7,bitwiseshiftleft,2,Thu Jun 18 22:52:16 2015 UTC,"Only 4 rounds seems a bit aggressive to me.  I would probably use 8.  I'm not thrilled with the non-hermetic nature of the sponge construction.  It doesn't matter most of the time, but it may limit the variations of the construction.  Overall, I have mixed feelings about P-sponges in general.  I understand that it's often easier to build permutations than non-invertible functions.  But having an inverse seems like a liability more often than not, especially if the inverse is slower and more complicated so that nobody will ever use it.  It also can mess up security proofs.  That said, NORX seems like an OK design.  I'd just expect to see 3.5/4 rounds get broken.  They'll bump the round count to have a safety margin, but it'll still be plenty fast."

Also addition is more complex operation, therefore possibly stronger."

Mr. Berstein's work is also a poor choice in this scenario (it is not yet mature enough vs alternatives). You simply can't beat AES-CTR with HMAC as a long-term crypto choice today (for a client-based password manager scenario, like KeePass).  There is no need to rewrite KeePass as it is. It can keep its AES-CBC due to wide availability and implementation ease. It is just missing an HMAC - add it in and we're done.

crypto,3a7e5g,dareksam,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:10:49 2015 UTC,"Well, you could add the option to authenticate by using a separate password for HMAC of the newly created credentials, after which all of it is encrypted with the public key. Then you don't allow for easy bruteforce of the HMAC key even if it is short like a PIN, and upon decryption the software can discard incorrectly authenticated ciphertexts."
crypto,3a7e5g,Natanael_L,3,Thu Jun 18 10:08:39 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts -   It seems like implementing AES-GCM safely as a AEAD scheme is quite hard to get right, but nothing insurmountable:   The IV has to be protected under the AAD. Must never re-use an IV with the same key, else the authenticity and integrity is lost. The IV should be at least 12 bytes long, if not 16 or more. Authentication tag lengths of 32-bit are likely to be very unsafe. If I'm understanding correctly, we should probably use an authentication tag of 256 bit and no less.   Have I forgotten anything?  But considering these, perhaps some other AEAD scheme such as EtM AES-256 / HMAC-SHA2-256 would be safer.  Folks bring up the point of slow filesystem bit-rot causing databases to be inaccessible, so perhaps something like Reed-Solomon forward error correction would be worthwhile, but does that compromise the security? I would figure File = RS( AEAD( Plaintext ) ), which I would assume would be a benign composition, but I wonder what other folks think.  Are folks still happy with the key derivation algo? /u/Creshal brings up a good point - he uses scrypt instead of pbkdf2, since pbkdf2 doesn't require large amounts of memory to run in parallel, and can be made significantly faster on FPGAs or ASICs. scrypt instead imposes large memory requirements as well as CPU, thus defeating the custom hardware problem.  Also, I'm not sure if I understand the timing attack complaints - making KeePass secure against timing attacks would probably mean a lot more than fixing the stupid ArrayEquals() implementation - after all, wouldn't we need to worry about the AES and HMAC-SHA implementations too? I don't know of any reference that claims the implementations used in .Net are secure against timing attacks, but maybe I'm wrong."
crypto,3a7e5g,Creshal,5,Wed Jun 17 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"Folks bring up the point of slow filesystem bit-rot causing databases to be inaccessible   If that's a concern, just use ZFS/btrfs with sufficient redundancy. It's a concern for non-authenticating databases too – if the metadata (headers, delimiters, …) of your DB are corrupted, you might not be able to parse the file anyway, even if it decrypts without warnings.  (yspave creates a backup database file after all writing operations. I was mainly concerned that bugs introduced by me would eff up the database, but it offers some recovery against bit-rot, too, at the price of reverting your last write.)   perhaps something like Reed-Solomon forward error correction would be worthwhile   I'd skip straight to turbocodes, to keep the overhead minimal, and I think applying FEC on top of encrypted data doesn't really introduce any new security considerations.   Are folks still happy with the key derivation algo?   You might consider waiting for the PHC to finish. Among a few new algorithms, it also features an improved version of scrypt (yescrypt).   But yeah, with password databases you have no possibility to impose artificial limitations on the brute force speed (unlike, say, website logins), so I really wouldn't want to use anything remotely fast here.   after all, wouldn't we need to worry about the AES and HMAC-SHA implementations too?

Well, one huge strength of KeePass is that it just stores data in a single file and what you do with that is up to you; asking people to use ZFS seems silly. Anybody that wants to keep it on google drive, or an sftp share, or on Windows may have zero choice over the storage method.   That's why I brought up FEC ala Reed-Solomon - up until the FEC is overwhelmed, it'll keep working even if you get random bitrot or lose an entire filesystem block (assuming the FEC uses interleaving).   I mentioned RS only because its the easiest one I know to implement and has a lot of supporting code out there; I've had a hard time finding concrete information on implementing turbo codes or LDPC codes (if you have any good resources, I'd love to read them, btw).  My initial impression is that FEC efficiency isn't exactly critical - I'm assuming that the password databases being used here aren't huge, probably in the realm of 50k on average, maybe a couple megs at the worst; my own file is only 25 kbytes. So the difference between a FEC that reaches 80% of the theoretical limit versus one that reaches 95% doesn't seem important to me here.

Let's be realistic, bit rot is rare. Really damn rare. File system or firmware errors are more probable to corrupt any given file than bit rot – because storage media already implement FEC. The 1:10¹⁴ or ¹⁵ chance for read errors is after several layers of FEC were applied.  If you're paranoid, you can apply FEC onto your password file (and are hopefully using ECC RAM, otherwise bit rot can still occur afterwards!)… or you can make an off-site backup. The latter doesn't only protect against bit rot, but also against file system errors, mechanical failures, electrical failures, theft, floods, hurricanes, bored cats with water glasses, small children with screwdrivers, and meteor impacts up to 50 megatons."

You type in your passphrase and wait 5 seconds while it randomly churns through a GB of memory before it tells you whether or not you just won the plaintext.  An attacker would have to be able to tamper with it repeatedly, have you attempt to decrypt it repeatedly, and monitor the reaction time with great precision, many, many, many times.  All to hopefully, eventually, get you to decrypt a random blob of data instead of what should have been there.

Dominik answered/acknowledged your issues and fixed some of the bugs...  http://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/2eac8c83/#7763  Quoting:   The goal of process memory protection is to make it harder for an attacker to find any useful data in the swap file (the goal is not to defend against active memory scanners; if you have malware on your PC, everything's lost anyway). At some point of time sensitive data is stored in process memory as plaintext (for instance the AES encryption class of the .NET Framework holds the key as a byte array), and if we're unlucky exactly then a swap occurs. In .NET there's one additional problem with memory clearing: the garbage collector can move around memory, so even when clearing sensitive buffers this might just clear a copy of it and there may be another location that cannot be cleared.  My primary focus for process memory protection was to prevent user passwords being directly visible in >memory, because these would be easy to find. KeePass additionally erases many cryptographic buffers, but not each and every intermediate one (although in general of course the more the better). Finding a single buffer in the swap file won't help an attacker much, as a multitude of other data (seeds, initialization vectors, hashes, other keys, ..., all being random data at unknown memory locations and most of them cleared) would be required for the data being useful (in contrast to directly usable user passwords).  For the two locations mentioned explicitly in the posting, I've now added memory clearing. That raises the bar by a few micrometers :-)  Best regards, Dominik"

That is the proper way to determine if the contents of two different byte arrays are equal. You can't do if ( array1 == array2) or try Array.Equals because those will be reference comparisons and will return false if the arrays are difference references but have the same values. There is no built-in way to perform array comparisons in .Net, excluding LINQ. LINQ is typically avoided for these sorts of applications because it causes memory allocations just to perform comparisons.  Edit:  I think I might understand why the author is picking on the existence of this function - it is a classical timing attack vulnerability because it shortcuts if some early value in the array isn't equal.  However, the author makes a bad case that this code is bad:   For one, the author presents no analysis indicating that this function is being used in a security critical context (perhaps it is used for other functionality).  For two, the major point of this article is that KeePass lacks HMAC and AEAD. Without any HMAC to speak of, what timing attack would be there to exploit? For three, even if there is a timing attack to be had, isn't that the least of your concerns? To exploit a timing attack on KeePass, you'd have to have access to the machine its running on, and at that point all bets are off and there are many, many easier ways to get data out of keepass than to some slow-to-exploit timing attack."

First, I doubt the 1-in-50k number by one or two orders of magnitude. But I haven't seen any hard numbers. It's a strict tradeoff between false-positives and -negatives, and it's usually biased very much to avoid false-negatives, because it cripples user experience if the phone doesn't unlock when it should.  That's why there is the strict ""5 attempts"" limit after which you need your pin; this is why you need your pin after bootup, or after not unlocking 24h+ (edi: oops, 48h really. that's.. a lot). That's also (one reason) why fingerprint matching is done on the dedicated processor, because essentially all you can derive from the fingerprint is a ""yes/no"" binary decision, unlike a PIN or passphrase, that can be stretched to provide a sufficient seed for disk encryption."

The only thing it mentions is to encrypt the document using blowfish with CFB mode. The key is derived using PBKDF2, which won't stand up to brute force attacks that well if you pick a bad password.   Honestly if you're using GPG to encrypt the document afterwards, I don't see why you'd even bother with the encryption on the document itself.   7z seems to compress GPG files pretty well.   Are you using the ascii armored output instead of the normal binary format? Encrypted files shouldn't compress very well at all, due to the fact that they should look like random data. That's likely why the ODF standard specifies that they should be compressed before the encryption is applied."

I just don't get how to handle the keys and the fingerprint. I think the public key is so the person who wants to send you a message uses that, and then the only way to decrypt that block of text is to use your private key? Still, there are different versions and I've seen different keys and fingerprints. It's confusing, and like I was saying, it can be hard to ask about this kind of stuff, and all my friends shame me, thinking it's insanity, ""nothing to hide"", and all that.

Second the list of numbers items does not count against my overhead.  Three at runtime I know N.  What I would suggest is finding a group thats larger then your maximum size, which you said was ~30k and a generator for that group.  For this example those will be G=35963 and g=2.  I start with a random number 0...G exclusive and just multiply by 2 and mod G  each time.  This will give me each number between those to once and only once and is going to be in a fairly random order.  This is pretty much what diffie hellman is based on.  To go in reverse I just multiply by the modular multiplicative inverse in this case 17982.  4*17982%35963=2 hence it went reverse from 2*2.

And yes, a cryptographically secure shuffle is total overkill and there are any number of 'good enough' solutions, I'm mostly just scratching an itch here because I feel like this is something that's probably been studied and I'm just not looking in the right places, and the RAM limitation rules out a lot of possibilities.

crypto,39qqy6,martins_m,2,Sat Jun 13 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"Format-preserving encryption:       In cryptography, format-preserving encryption (FPE) refers to encrypting in such a way that the output (the ciphertext) is in the same format as the input (the plaintext). The meaning of ""format"" varies. Typically only finite domains are discussed, for example:   To encrypt a 16-digit credit card number so that the ciphertext is another 16-digit number. To encrypt an English word so that the ciphertext is another English word. To encrypt an n-bit number so that the ciphertext is another n-bit number. (That's actually the definition of an n-bit block cipher.)   For such finite domains, and for the purposes of the discussion below, the cipher is equivalent to a permutation of N integers {0, ... , N−1} where N is the size of the domain.

I can't use the table version, but the cycle walking implementation is very similar to something I was exploring - but I ran into the problem it mentions with the domain being much smaller than the block size.  I've got to find at most 216 elements (and more like 212 in practice) and the block cipher I've got available (without taking up any extra, very limited code space) is XXTEA with a 64-bit block size.  The Hasty Pudding cipher might be a good candidate if there's a sufficiently small implementation.  I'm going to read more on the Thorp shuffle.  The Feistel network stuff is a little over my head.

Who might be trying to reverse-engineer the key algorithm or write a crack, how good are they / how much effort are you spending, and how worried are you about them? Which false positives (honest customer who upgrades their system) are unacceptable, and which ones are you okay with if necessary?  Your verification code is, fundamentally, running on their system. They own and control their system; you don't. In a mathematical sense, product key mechanisms don't work. At one level, since the key has to be verified somehow, your product has to include code to do that verification. So if you want to check that they're on the same system as they paid for, there will be code running on customer systems to go and check various system properties and combine them in some order, and someone can reverse-engineer that code. At another level, someone could just reverse-engineer the check itself, and patch it out entirely. Or they could fake the current date, so it looks like the trial has never ended. All of these are pretty straightforward for someone who knows what they're doing.  Maybe you're not worried about that. Maybe it's OK if someone who knows what they're doing can break the system: you just want to make sure the casual user is persuaded to pay for the right licenses. As the centuries-old saying goes, locks are there to keep honest people honest.  If that's fine, then your job is easier, since you don't need to be mathematically rigorous, and you can, and probably should, optimize to reduce false positives (honest customers who are unhappy with you) at the cost of false negatives (pirates who aren't stopped). Both RSA and ECC signatures would be more than fine, mathematically, but the big problem is that signatures are going to be way too long to use as product keys. You could have a license file that contains an RSA signature, and email that file around instead of expecting people to type in a key.  If that's not fine, you may want to rethink your business model since this approach is mathematically impossible. That said, DRM is mathematically impossible and some DRM companies seem to be staying afloat. So you could invest a bunch of time and money into making it painful to reverse-engineer with things like obfuscation (even though it's still technically possible), upgrading the scheme regularly, and generally staying one step ahead in an arms race. You will suffer more false positives as you try to drive the false negative rate down, but sometimes that's what the boss demands.  (Is this a web app or a local app? You said your software is ""online only"", but if it's a web app, you don't know what computer they're running on. You certainly can't get the MAC address and things.)"

If you decrypt the data in the process, you lose the security guarantees / you're not working in a homomorphic model any more.  The DRM problem (as I'm using the term) is to end up playing unencrypted content on a consumer-owned general-purpose computer, while denying them the ability to record that content or replay it arbitrarily or to copy it to other computers. That's what I'm claiming is impossible, since you're ending up outputting the unencrypted content to an OS under their control."

In particular, for a protocol like SSL (which is a fine high-level design), you generate a few shared session keys, and have one party sign something using their long-term key (RSA, EdDSA, whatever). Then you know that anyone using those session keys must be the same entity who controls the long-term key. The streamed content is authenticated-encrypted using those symmetric keys, one chunk at at time. This means that you can check the authentication of each chunk separately, and you can reject it immediately.  Otherwise streaming is sort of useless: if you're streaming a 3 GB video, you can't even start playing it until you have downloaded the entire thing and hashed it. If you do chunk-at-a-time verification, then you can start playing it as soon as you have the first chunk, because you know it hasn't been tampered with."

In your case, one output block is one of the input blocks, the other is the XOR of both input blocks, both XORed with the XOR-sum of all or all minus the last round keys (depending on the number of rounds and which block you're looking at).

If I compute L xor (ouput L), I get (k2 xor k3). With the right channel, (k1 xor k2) = L xor (ouput L).  I feel like you tried to make differential cryptanalysis easy by ensuring a differential persists throughout the network, but you turned it into a one-time pad. Plus, differential cryptanalysis isn't a known plaintext attack, you're thinking of linear cryptanalysis. Differential cryptanalysis is about allowing the attacker to encrypt two messages of his choice that have a low hamming difference.  Furthermore, your key derivation function appears (at first glance) to simply be  x2 mod (15484223 * 15484243)  Since we have or can find k1 xor k2, k1 xor k3, and k2 xor k3, I don't think we can find your initial key. Not because it relies on the discrete logarithm problem, but because we don't have any of the subkeys. Knowing any of them would let an attacker trivially derive the seed key.  However, as mentioned above, this cipher is not a feistel, just a one-time pad. If you want to practice differential cryptanalysis, try FEAL-4.3 from the NYU CTF. Alternatively, try this one"

That is not the case here as the sub keys stay the same for the entire length of the message, and we could pass any number of blocks through the algorithm, or am I misunderstanding?     I did not expect the initial key to be found, just the subkeys. Even with your L xor K2 xor K3 I still do not know how to solve for a given key. I wrote my own equations to describe the output and they match yours, but given that in both equations there are 2 unknowns I do not understand how we are meant to solve them, though I suspect the answer is trivial and I am being stupid :)     Finally, if this had a more complex round function, would it be classed as having a Feistel structure? I thought ""Feistel"" referred to any cipher that split the plain text into blocks, processed 2 at a time where each round 1 block is preserved while the other is xored with the round key and the preserved block.     Thanks everyone for taking the time to answer, it might click eventually :)"

Just about nobody has an effective SSL strength greater than 2048-bit RSA. Even if you used a 4096-bit RSA end-entity key (which my team did for a while, and found that it was super slow to handshake), since all the roots and intermediates in common use are 2048-bit keys, you're still not secure against an attacker with the ability to brute-force a 2048-bit RSA key. That's equivalent to about a 112-bit symmetric cipher. We round that off to AES-128 since that's faster than 3DES (which is 112-bit strength), but there's no measurable security in going beyond 112-bit strength until we solve the 2048-bit RSA key problem.  ECDSA / Ed25519 will probably solve that problem in the long term: since even 4096-bit RSA keys are far too slow to get mass adoption, 15 Kb keys would be completely unusable. But it'll be a while before root CAs and intermediates start using ECC.  So, since AES-256 isn't adding security until then, we might as well use the faster option, since one of the biggest deployment obstacles to HTTPS is the perception that SSL is too slow, and 0-bit security is definitely the wrong option.

The paper is great, however it's unfortunately not accurate to say that ""SHA-256 was verified in OpenSSL"".  The version verified is a c-language derivative of SHA-256 from OpenSSL 0.9.8.

Sorry, I was looking at the wrong picture. For the one that you linked, I can think of two possible reasons. First, the only non-linearity comes from the S-box. The P operation is linear, so from a cryptanalysis perspective, it doesn't matter how you shuffle the bits around after the last S-box round, it doesn't add any confusion.  The second reason is that the decryption operation is now the exact inverse (the network is symmetric about a horizontal axis) which means you can use the same hardware for both encryption and decryption by simply flipping the lookup table for the S-box."

Think of it like this: Move box from location 1 to location 5, and paint it with color 5.  You still know exactly where that box came from even though you painted it a new color.    Mathematically, if σ is your permutation, then σ(A) XOR K = σ (A XOR  σ-1 (K)) and since σ is now in the outermost layer, it can be trivially inverted.  On the other hand, with a good substitution box S, then S(A) XOR K cannot be easily converted into S(A XOR T(K)) where T is some easily computable function."

By the way, if you're wondering why any of this should offer any security, there isn't any ground truth to it.  We know when things don't give security or are insecure, but only have heuristics as to when things are secure.    If you want to study cryptography with some semblance of mathematical ground truth (like, say, ""factoring is hard""), you should check out complexity-theoretic based cryptography rather than cipher design and cryptanalysis.  It's far more fun and far less practical.  In my (severely biased) view, the only pure cryptanalysis is trying to figure out how to break math."

It's not completely trivial, but it my guess is that ""several dozen"" isn't going to cut it really.   The answer is ""I don't know"".  And this is the answer to almost any non-linear contribution you can make to a block cipher candidate.  The entire goal of block ciphers is to create what is known as a pseudorandom permutation (PRP), which is a permutation that is based on a key and is hard to invert without the key (despite the design being public).  Strong PRPs can be built from mathematics, but in practice they are built to be super fast rather than super secure.    By changing the design of a block cipher, the onus is on you to show that the security you gain from it is worth the extra effort you put in or vice versa.  This is a very difficult question to answer, which is why modern block cipher design is as much as an art as it is a science."

crypto,38jluh,fidelitypdx,13,Fri Jun 5 11:46:43 2015 UTC,"I took a Microsoft exam yesterday and one question and answer was so interesting that I almost blogged about it - here it is:   A customer is concerned whether Microsoft will provide access to the data she has stored on Office 365 if Microsoft is approached by any government authority requesting such access. What is the proper response?  Answer: Microsoft diverts requests for information to the customer and does not deal with information requests directly.   That can't always be true, but it's interesting none-the-less that they're positioning requests this way. I imagine this sets a precedent, even so much that a bank could encrypt your checking account information and require a 4-digit code (like your pin) to even see your balances or transactions. While it's true that anyone could easily brute force such a system, the bank could just flat refuse information on the grounds that they will not brute force it and they don't want a brute force attack run on their systems.   As to the article though:    Microsoft is well ahead of competitors like Apple in making BitLocker verify that an attacker hasn’t modified the software used to boot the computer.   Nah, I've seen that exploited on 8.0 (this was before 8.1). I don't remember the technical details of how they were doing it, but the SafeBoot system has vulnerabilities.    A Microsoft spokesperson said that Bloomberg’s reporting referred to Microsoft’s Government Security Program ... This program includes access to source code for key Microsoft products — so governments can check it for backdoors, the spokesperson told me — as well as “vulnerability and threat intelligence” from Microsoft. Microsoft says its intention is to be transparent, not to aid spy agencies in making malicious software. But it’s easy to imagine how a national government could repurpose Microsoft’s data in ways Microsoft may not have intended. And it’s worth noting that Microsoft’s transparency is only afforded to powerful national governments rather than to regular users.   Ummm, that same transparency is also afforded to Microsoft certified partners who go through the loops and NDA's to get the same information.... This particular line allegation is rather bullshit.    I asked Microsoft if the company would be able to comply with unlocking a BitLocker disk, given a legitimate legal request to do so. The spokesperson told me they could not answer that question.   AFAIK - Microsoft has not yet complied with unlocking a BitLocker disk, and probably never would - that's not the way this vulnerability would work - generally that's not the way courts work either. Does anyone have any evidence that the government or courts have approached Microsoft to do this? Plus, I imagine it would make headlines within the security world if some illicit file hoarder had their Bitlocker file system blown open by the FBI. It's generally easier to hold the person in a cage until they turn over an unencrypted version of their files."

So, most of the time an AES instance will have a ciphertext that matches the plaintext.  The input x such that AES_k(x) = x is also called a fixed point.

One example is active eavesdropping, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. The attacker must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject new ones.

Because of that, they did not follow security best practices, and opted for obscuration and proprietary trade secrets to keep the devices secure when we know that's just not good enough. Even now, their security whitepaper lists that they published in April/May timeframe shows that they're still using a mish-mash of crypt algorithms, some of which have been deprecated and trivial to break (eg, MD5, DES)  They had mocked the Blackberries exactly because they claim security is not important. Or, they would say something like our devices are secure, just trust us while providing little evidence that we should trust them.   Unwittingly, the general consumer just ate up that marketing message and pretend it's the gospel at the time.   I appreciate the change of strategy and the genuine attempt to improve the security in their products. I like the path they're going down, but they need to be more upfront about their history and not gloss over it."

The only thing I would take issue with (and I'm being picky: I think he did this for convenience) is composing the draft in your email client before signing/encrypting it. Most email clients will auto-save drafts of your email while you're working on it, and those drafts often get saved to the mail server (so you can pick up where you left off later from another computer if needs be). That means while you're writing it, your email that's sensitive enough to need encryption is being pushed up to your provider in the clear. Yes, drafts are deleted from the server (you hope!), but not until after the mail's sent. If it's genuinely sensitive (and not just being encrypted because encrypting everything is a good idea), compose it in a standalone text editor first, sign/encrypt it, and then drop the message into your email client when it's fully baked and ready to send."

Maybe Google was trying to promote bigger amounts of internal storage over the microSD slot cop-out from some OEMs.  Either way, I think they mentioned that for Android M you can ""adopt"" SD cards as internal storage (probably in a secure way), so we might see Google advocate the use of SD cards again.

We'll know for sure when M is out and then we can probably easily check for it against Whatsapp or even TextSecure, and see if Google Now ""knows"" what you're talking about.  The reason I said ""likely"" is because Google Now probably reads the data from the screen, and last I checked TextSecure or virtually all apps didn't encrypt the data as it's displayed on the screen. If that's how Google does it then it should be able to read the data for all apps, regardless of their encrypted at rest or through the network.  Also, as the above comment mentions developers actually have to opt-out of it through that flag, which also implies it can read all apps' data."
crypto,37pvac,VikingCoder,7,Sat May 30 14:10:20 2015 UTC,"We'd have to make several large assumptions on how the service actually works in order to make a claim like '3rd party end-to-end encrypted apps can be read by Google'.  I'd like to see some data on how it works, first!"

crypto,37pf9l,Zmetta,7,Fri May 29 10:45:37 2015 UTC,"It is possible, but likely not as useful as you might first imagine because of the dependencies created. An extremely simple and not recommended example is just using the XOR function:  Plaintext = P  True Key = K  Ciphertext = C  Fake Key = F  False Text = Q     [1] P ⊕ K = C [2] C ⊕ Q = F [3] You can now provide C ⊕ F = Q [4] or C ⊕ K = P   You now have two keys that transform a single ciphertext into two valid plain texts.   Note that you cannot change the original plaintext (be it a file, encrypted partition, etc) without needing to recalculate F from Q⊕C. You can, however, change Q without effecting P by recalculating F = C⊕Q.   This is a very simple PoC to show you that it is possible but not recommended for real world applications. If you're looking more for plausible deniability there are more involved answers out there."

crypto,37pf9l,thenickdude,6,Fri May 29 11:16:34 2015 UTC,"The ciphertext would have to be large enough to hold the entropy of both plaintexts. So if the plaintexts are high entropy (like compressed data), the ciphertext will basically be as large as the sum of the sizes of the plaintexts. This may hurt the ability to hide the existence of a second plaintext.   Volume encryption tools avoid that problem because it's not at all unusual to encrypt your entire drive but only partially fill it (so that extra free space can be used to hide data in)."
crypto,37pf9l,silverforest,5,Fri May 29 12:38:40 2015 UTC,Here is an example of that which requires the two plaintexts to be sufficiently close to each other.

crypto,37pf9l,gsuberland,4,Fri May 29 12:11:00 2015 UTC,"To some extent, yes. It's called deniable encryption.  You can achieve the ability to make proof of a second message by using random padding in single-message ciphertexts.  For single messages:   Compute c_1 = E(m, k), where m is the message and k is your key. Compute c_0 = E(|c_1|, k), where |x| denotes the length of x in bytes. Generate a random key j. Compute c_2 = E(p, j), where p is random data of random size. Discard j. Concatenate to get your ciphertext: c = c_0 || c_1 || c_2.   To decrypt, just decrypt the first block (c_0) to get the length of the first ciphertext, then decrypt that. An attacker cannot know that j was chosen randomly and discarded, so will not know that the second part of the ciphertext is meaningless.  For paired messages:   Compute c_1 = E(m_0, k_0), where m_0 is the ""known"" message and k_0 is your ""known"" key. Compute c_0 = E(|c_1|, k_0) Compute c_2 = E(m_1, k_1), where m_1 is the ""hidden"" message and k_1 is your ""hidden"" key. Concatenate to get your ciphertext: c = c_0 || c_1 || c_2.   In this case, decryption works the same as before, but you then decrypt c_2 with the hidden key to gain the hidden message.  Note that computing E(p, j) in the single-message case, rather than just padding the end of the ciphertext with j, is important for a number of reasons: (a) distinguishing attacks against the RNG or block cipher would break a padding approach, but not the encrypted padding approach; and (b) this solution provides increased resistance against side-channel attacks (e.g. timing attacks) because the encryption operation is performed the same number of times in single-message and paired-message operations.  This solution doesn't provide exactly what you specified, because an attacker may be able to tell that you used a mechanism that provides plausible deniability (e.g. if they know the length of the ""known"" message, and the length of the ciphertext, they can see that there's some additional data there), but they have no concrete proof as to whether you sent a single or paired message in this design."
crypto,37pf9l,dabombnl,1 point,Fri May 29 12:27:06 2015 UTC,I assume the second key can be chosen arbitrarily? Any symmetric encryption will do this.
crypto,37pf9l,Sostratus,1 point,Fri May 29 16:50:24 2015 UTC,"Any one-time pad-like system like /u/Zmetta suggested, would have a key that could decrypt the ciphertext to every possible plaintext.  If we contrast this with AES-256 for example, it's a 128-bit block cipher with a 256-bit key. There are (2128)! possible 128-bit block ciphers, but you can only get to 2256 of them (which is a mind-bogglingly huge number and yet still a tiny, tiny fraction of (2128)!) This creates what's called ""poor-man's authentication"", since probably only the one correct key decrypts into something that makes sense.  But with a one-time pad, there are as many keys as there are plaintexts. So there's no way to verify whether a given key is the correct one, there exists a key that will produce all possible plaintexts and they all look valid.  More practically, you could use TrueCrypt with a hidden volume. An attacker would know a second volume is possible, but there's no way to distinguish a volume that contains a hidden volume from one that doesn't if you don't have the password."
crypto,37k1wd,balkierode,8,Thu May 28 04:53:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, you've got end-to-end encryption confused with transport encryption."
crypto,37k1wd,phyzome,2,Thu May 28 10:44:55 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  And that's bad because transport security only protects one hop. If your mail bounces around a few mail servers before your main mx, and then a few more afterward, good luck trying to keep it encrypted the entire time.   Additionally, there's no reason why transport encryption has to be domain based, if we're talking about what's technically possible. We could just as easily make http's tls certs url-specific and now every path on a single domain could have a different cert. That's not the protocol, but there's no reason it couldn't be.   In the same vein, there's no reason why you couldn't purchase a certificate from verisign that's tied to your email address, and now the mail servers use that to establish a tls session once the 'mail from' and 'rcpt to' commands have been sent. Again, that's not the protocol, but it could be if we so decided.   Still, it's not end to end encryption and the original question as posed is a bit presumptive."

If I have to prevent those emails not to be read by intermediary like google/yahoo/ms, should I have to run my own mail server with tls support? Or is there any other solution for the problem. Lets say I am fine with the intermediary knowing the source of the email. i.e it can know I am getting mails from a particular bank website but it should not be able to read the transactions (Assume the statements are not in an encrypted pdf)."

Will that be the case if I run my own mail server with tls enabled?
crypto,37k1wd,silverforest,2,Thu May 28 18:14:10 2015 UTC,"No, transport encryption only covers a single ""hop"", and multiple relays handle your mail."
crypto,37k1wd,bigshmoo,2,Thu May 28 19:56:50 2015 UTC,"I run my own mail server with tls enabled?    No, you can only guarantee the last hop. Furthermore since SMTP has opportunistic encryption it's easy for a man-in-the-middle to force the connection to not use TLS.  There is no good way to guarantee transport security with e-mail if you want to be compatible with everyone else out there. The best thing to do is to rip it all out and start over with a new protocol but good luck convincing everyone to do that."

For that you need an error correcting code.  And if the cipher mode use some cascade, then everything after that block is now RIP unless you figure out the correct data for the block."
crypto,37fkys,TheTerrasque,8,Wed May 27 09:20:21 2015 UTC,"Depends, but in some cases yes.. Since many block cipher modes use the previous block as part of the key for next, a bit error can potentially cascade and result in everything past it being garbled."

crypto,37fkys,TheTerrasque,3,Wed May 27 08:44:19 2015 UTC,"Processing overhead, harder to recover from problems, harder to debug, and so on. Generally more of a pain in the arse to deal with.  When it comes to data corruption, you do have things like Hamming code that can detect and even repair bit errors, at the cost of more storage space.  If so that should be applied after hmac type codes (or ideally combined, but I don't think any of the error correcting codes can be used as a hmac type checksum), so...    hamming(hmac(crypto(data)))   should make the data more robust against small bit errors."
crypto,37fkys,balkierode,3,Wed May 27 09:16:24 2015 UTC,It wouldn't probably change likeliness of corruption. But if it ever becomes corrupted it is less likely to be able to recover uncorrupted parts of the data.
crypto,37fkys,xauxau,3,Wed May 27 14:34:20 2015 UTC,"I could write a doctorate on this topic (I've done post-graduate study on encryption and have over a decade's professional experience in the practical uses of crypto), so I'm trying not to over-complicate the answer.  I'm assuming you're interested in two cases: On-disk or over network. For those cases, in theory yes, many of the answers already here point out that block cyphers propagate errors to later blocks in the modes used for disk encryption.  In actual practice no, encryption does not make corruption more likely.   Modern disk hardware is error detecting and correcting in the firmware of the disk itself - the OS may not even be aware that a disk error has occurred. Any disk errors won't reach the encryption/decryption code to cause a problem.  TCP/IP networking is designed to handle almost arbitrary levels of transmission problems and recover, even before you add the recovery / error detection at the session/application layers.  Modern hardware also has ridiculous amounts of spare capacity for performing crypto. AES is efficient in software, feel free to turn encryption on everywhere. We used to have to worry about encryption workload back in the 1990s. People radically underestimate how much power modern computing equipment has. Back in the late 90s I was running multi-million dollar Sun E10000 servers - 64-CPU monsters the size of a huge fridge. Peak performance: 50 GFlops. iPhone 5S peak performance: 115 Gflops. Yes, an iPhone has more raw CPU grunt than a $2.5mil server from the late 90s."
crypto,37fkys,Sostratus,2,Wed May 27 23:38:44 2015 UTC,"It depends on many things. In general, one corrupted bit of unencrypted data = one corrupted bit, while one corrupted bit in encrypted data means at least a whole block (128 bits usualy) is corrupted, and likely the next block would also be corrupted if this data was encrypted with a block cipher in CBC mode.  But most storage media has error correcting code which operates invisibly to you. Ideally it should detect if the number of errors goes above some critical threshhold and relocate the sector before it becomes unreadable. Sometimes the firmware fails to catch this in time, but when that happens, most software treats the entire sector as a total loss (GRC's SpinRite is an exception, it tries to recover as much as it can from a bad sector). Depending on the storage device, a sector will be 512 to 4096 bytes, much larger than one encryption block.   However also (in theory) you might be able to correct small errors in encrypted blocks even without an attached error correcting code. If the decrypted data has some kind of expected structure, then you could flip bits one at a time in the corrupted ciphertext until a sensible output appears. This is sometimes called ""poor man's authentication"". But in practice this kind of data correction would be a real pain to implement, and it would only be useful for low-entropy plaintexts.  Bottom line, encryption doesn't put you at substantially higher risk of corruption, and always have two backups."

Given only the access we want them to have. Even the UX must be designed for security, like in Qubes OS with OS controlled window colors for the different (virtualized) workspaces. Apps should be able to enforce isolation / virtualization internally too, such as for parser processes, for more levels of security. And so on..."

crypto,376467,Caminsky,2,Mon May 25 15:02:14 2015 UTC,"Well, javascript allows patching of code pretty easily and that's just bad for secure crypto.  If you take the browser element out, there's no real advantage for crypto being done in javascript. You may as well use anything else. The whole reason people want crypto to work in js is because they could have it run clientside on websites.  There is that google project to make it a browser extension which is much more promising than any other website that attempted crypto, and it gets around a lot of the problems mentioned in the old matasano article ""Javascript Crypto considered harmful"". Supposedly some good cryptographers worked on it, like Thai Duong, but personally I didn't see any source commits from him when I checked out the code dump they distributed. It was just a dump of the code, and nothing you could really see in the history to implicate what he wrote.  Still, if you're taking the browser element out, the only place I can see JS crypto having is in node, and that's just a choice of your toolset. It could be anything else. And at that point I'd personally be using GPG. I used to say ssl too, but people are wrecking that lately. Unless you know what you're doing and disable export ciphers at least, it'd be a hard platform to use right.  I'd say the root of the problem isn't ""how browsers work with JS"", but rather, you're trusting JS sent from the site at runtime, and any other extension or js running could break it. Even some sort of XSS attack. You don't want your crypto being dependent on the site not having an XSS flaw that breaks it. You could say that's ""how browsers work with JS"", but any sort of platform that is trying to distribute client-side code at runtime is not a great platform for crypto, and I don't think that can be fixed by changing browser design. It seems to be a flaw in the design in general, browser or not."

If you check out the matasano article, one reason they suggest it's bad is ""The malleability of the Javascript runtime"", and I don't think there's a practical way around that, though of course that is much much more of a problem in a browser.  I'll admit my experience with node is limited and I'm not sure if there's ways to harden that and make sure the functions you are calling are exactly as they were when the program started. If you can do that, and you DO that, I don't see that as an issue, but that's hard to do and it's a given when you run native code, unless there's a serious memory flaw where you can overwrite function addresses or something like that."

They seem to learn from criticism, although too slowly for me to be able to trust their software.   Telegram has a really weird design, and they seem to be far too overconfident, and as far as I know there's no single instance in which their code has been effectively unbreakable. Together with per-session authentication, not long term per-keypair authentication, with only an effective strength of 64 bits (through precomputed birthday bruteforce attack on 128 bits of the hash of the negotiated session key, which them enables undetected MITM), and that the default is plaintext messaging, it should just be avoided."
crypto,375lor,rollie82,4,Mon May 25 02:05:57 2015 UTC,"It's important to talk about what this kind of password scheme does and does not protect against.  Hash.com hashes passwords using this scheme. Plain.com does not. Alice uses the same password on both.  Scenario one. Eve successfully does a passive MITM attack between Alice and Hash.com. Eve sees the hashed password. Using this scheme Eve is now able to use Alice's credentials to log into Hash.com any time she wants by just replaying the hashed password.  It's not clear that there's a way to mitigate against that with any simple change to this scheme.   But at least, at first glance, Eve cannot use Alice's Hash.com credentials to log into Plain.com, because Eve doesn't know the original password. Except that dictionary attacks against password hashes are surprisingly effective given real world passwords, and even brute force attacks are moderately effective against the typical short passwords.  To somewhat mitigate against dictionary attacks (but not much) and to pretty effectively mitigate against brute force it might make sense to use a computationally expensive function such as bcrypt. But here we run into a challenge: typical clients are running whatever brand of browser with whatever generation of Javascript engine. A hash function computationally expensive enough to fight against brute forcing may actually be too expensive for some of your users from a usability perspective. Obviously that concern doesn't hold if you have more control over minimum specification of clients.  Scenario two. Eve successfully does a MITM attack between Alice and Plain.com. Eve sees the plain text password. She is able to log into either Plain.com or Hash.com any time she wants simply by logging in through the front door. So this extra layer doesn't help in the reverse direction.  I think the same reasoning applies to credit cards."

If your authentication system is encrypted with TLS and the client does its due diligence on authenticating the server, a disclosure of the hash or password are equivalent.  However, now if you you use your password on another service, and your password is disclosed by the authentication channel, your attacker may reuse that password directly. However, if the attacker obtains the hash, he/she now has virtually unlimited time to crack a single hash. And your attacker will have the challenge nonce.  And there's really no other attack vector. TLS is supposed to do this protection for you. And if the server is compromised, traditional attacks apply to the database. And any better access means the attacker can subvert the challenge-response scheme.  As a security consultant, I always advise against challenge and response schemes where transport encryption is a better solution."

But since it provides no tangible benefit, those features have fell out of favor and we're mostly relics of a time when SSL was still resource intensive to implement.  However, I know that Rhovo.com uses it. Their use case is that your password secures peer to peer communication, and they don't want a copy of your password. Still, naive, since the hash is based on the password, Rhovo can just crack the hash you send them. Along with any attacker."
crypto,375lor,aydiosmio,2,Mon May 25 22:46:47 2015 UTC,"No.  There are two considerations for protecting passwords: Ensuring that people who observe wire communications can't authenticate as a user, and ensuring that people with a copy of the server's database can't authenticate as any users.  Normally this is achieved by storing H(P, S) on the server, sending P over an encrypted channel, recalculating H(P, S) from P, and comparing it to the stored value.  What you're proposing is essentially to store H(H(P, S1), S2), send the user S1, have them send H(P, S1) over the wire and use that to calculate H(H(P, S1), S2) to verify against the database. But this is really just extra complexity without any concrete security benefits. An attacker who can get H(P, S1) off the wire has something just as useful as P in the previous scenario.  Another alternative would be to store P on the server, send the user a random nonce (N) and have them calculate H(P, N). In this scenario, the value the user is sending over the wire changes each time they authenticated, so an eavesdropper can't get a value useful for authenticating later. But now anyone who gets the database can acquire P for every user. You can complicate this by storing H(P, S1), sending the user S1 and N, and having them compute H(H(P, S1), N), but it's still the case that anyone who acquires a copy of the database can authenticate as any user.  For typical web applications, the best solution is what people do today. Store a token on the server that can be calculated from the password, and rely on an encrypted channel for transmitting the password. If you can't trust the encrypted channel, you're going to have other problems.  You'll probably be interested in the Secure Remote Password protocol (SRP). It uses a variant of the Diffie-Hellman key negotiation protocol to simultaneously authenticate the client with the server, the server with the client, and establish a session key for sending secrets between the client and server. It's not very useful with web applications, because you still have to trust the encrypted channel to deliver the right version of the JavaScript to manage the communication. It could be useful for other client/server applications, where the client application can be verified and isn't retransmitted every session.  [EDIT]  I also have a JavaScript / Django implementation of SRP on Github, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything beyond learning the protocol."
crypto,375lor,AusIV,3,Mon May 25 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"no server would ever know the users actual password, even if that server were compromised.   Except that a compromised server could just serve an updated login page that doesn't hash the login details.  And if you just hashed the passwords, rather than using a key derivation function like bcrypt or scrypt, your database of hashed passwords will be less secure to attack.  And if you using a Javascript implementation of bcrypt or scrypt, it's almost certainly not going to be as well tested as a server implementation."
crypto,375lor,weavejester,1 point,Mon May 25 02:32:26 2015 UTC,"This is true for the first case outlined - if a user can actually change the behavior of the site entirely, the security could be bypassed.

Also, it would be easy enough for the browser itself to require password fields to be hashed (would require some standards tweaks).  Even with the limitation you mention, I still think it would provide some value on the password front, and maybe even more value on the CC# front (given how many times companies' have been compromised)"
crypto,375lor,weavejester,3,Mon May 25 02:48:41 2015 UTC,"If the attacker only has read access to the database, then even if the passwords were encrypted on the server, the attacker still wouldn't have the plaintext.

crypto,375lor,nVitius,3,Mon May 25 03:33:07 2015 UTC,"In your algorithm you have credit card number and expiration date, so at first glance it looks like 16+4 digits, or 1020 possibilities.  However, there are only 12 months, and credit cards are typically set to expire within 20 years, so rather than 10,000 possibilities for the expiry date, there's actually only 240.  On the credit card number, the final four digits are usually public, in order for the user to identify which credit card it is, so that means that rather that there being 1016 possibilities, there's only 1012. Credit card numbers also employ the Luhn algorithm to fix single-digit mistakes, effectively bringing the entropy down to 1011.  We could narrow the possibilities down even further, because the first 6 digits are the Bank Identification Number (BIN), and you could narrow this down to a very small number, particularly if you knew all users were from one particular country.  But even if you didn't, that's 2.4 × 1013 possibilities, and modern GPUs can churn through SHA256 at a rate of billions ( 109 ) a second. With dedicated hardware (hello bitcoin miner), you can get up to trillions of hashes per second ( 1012 ) from a single machine.  So at worst, with just a normal desktop PC with a decent graphics card, with no BIN optimisation, you're talking around a minute to brute force each number. By narrowing down the BIN and using dedicated hardware, you could easily brute force thousands a second.  Of course, you'd get a different result if you used an KDF algorithm like bcrypt or scrypt, rather than a hashing algorithm that is designed to be fast, but it's still hard to get around the lack of entropy a CC number has. A six-letter password is more secure."

Yes, it is understood that a backdoor can exist and is based on how the parameters are chosen.  An honest generator chooses the parameters P and Q at ""random"", and therefore is not able to tell the ""relationship"" between them.  However, a dishonest generator picks one parameter P, and then picks the ""relationship"", and generates Q from that relationship.  It is done in a way that is identically distributed to choosing P and Q randomly.    I'll give an example: suppose we don't know how to subtract, but we know how to add.  A crypto scheme tells us that we are going to roll 2 dice and write down the dice roll, and if we happen to know the difference between the two dice numbers then we can break the crypto.  You can do this honestly: roll them and let that be your two numbers, and since you don't know how to subtract, the crypto isn't broken.  However, you can also do it dishonestly as follows: roll 1 die, pick a number x, add it to that die to get your other die's number (wrapping around if needed) and claim that as the outcome of your dice roll.  Now a dishonest generator knows the difference between the two numbers (it's x), but the dice roll is identically distributed to an honest dice roll.  This now serves as a backdoor.  You can prove you know x by showing it to the world, but an honest person can't prove that they don't know x!  Of course, it's not a particularly deep sentiment that you can't prove you don't know the relationship , but you can only prove you do know the relationship.

Starting with a random seed n, your algorithm outputs the encryption of n, the encryption of n + 1, the encryption of n + 2, etc.  Provided that you did in fact throw away the private key, this scheme is as cryptographically strong as your encryption algorithm is: it's impossible for an attacker to determine one output from knowing any other outputs, because that would imply the ability to decrypt things without the key. However, if you somehow failed to throw away the private key, the scheme is ludicrously insecure to you. You can just decrypt any ""random"" number and read off the current input, and then you can calculate any other output.  The trouble is that the NSA standardized an encryption algorithm exactly like this, using (effectively) an elliptic curve public-key algorithm, and promised to throw away the private key.  It's a little subtler than that in practice. At the time they proposed Dual_EC_DRBG, they told us about the algorithm itself, and told us that the constants were random. Sometime later, some researchers noticed, hey, this bit of math looks sorta like public-key encryption, I wonder if there's a private-key decryption algorithm that goes along with it.

It seems the advertised protocol or business model (centralized trustless CA) can be implemented with standard hash function and does not require the 'BLT' algorithm. The marketing language is vague"
crypto,37003g,ristlaan,3,Sat May 23 20:32:07 2015 UTC,"All true, that's how marketing works.  TL;DR about the technology (an author here):  BLT: how to build a digital signature scheme from one-time password scheme and a cryptographic time-stamping service.  KSI: a product built on top of linking-based time-stamping[1] system. Provides endpoint authentication, time, and the long-term security can be proven based on collision resistance[2], preimage awareness[3], or other properties of hash function. So, ""keyless"" in ""keyless siganture infrastructure"" means, that the long-term security does not depend on any secrets like keys.  Another view to the KSI is that it is a blockchain technology---the blockchain is built using a quorum of distributed 'core' sites: one block per second, and the top of global distributed Merkle tree goes into the blockchain. Oh, distributed Merkle tree makes the system handsomely scalable[4].  Back to BLT: We use Lamport one-time password scheme. Starts from private key z_l, which is hashed recursively, ends with public key z_0 = h(z_1) = h(h(z_2))  ..... h(..(z_l)..). For simplicity assume that key z_i can be only used at time i. Signing data M:   x = h(M, z_i) send x to time-stamping service, get back signature token S_i for data x. wait for clock tick, to be sure that z_i is not revealed before time i+1.   Signature for M is (i, z_i, S_i).  Verification:   Verify S_i, extract i and x Compute hash x = h(M, z_i) if everything matches then signature is correct.   Now, there are lots of optimizations, described in papers.   Cryptographically strong clock reading can be extracted from S_i, so there is no need to depend on local clock (in the case of previously described simplest case) Critical parts can be implemented in smartcard, so that host computer does not see z_i before i+1 It is possible to revoke keys if time-stamping service authenticates users, and ID is part of the ""certificate"" Instead of traversing big part of hash chain during verification it is possible to use compact proof with size log(l), instead of storing entire secret hash chain at key owner side it is possible to use Jakobsson's pebbling algorithm, now storage is log2 l and releasing a key takes also log2 l hashing steps; if we fix time-stamping service provider id in ""certificate"" then it is possible to use keys sequentially (so that they are not time-bound) etc.    With some (hideable) complexity the scheme can be tailored for many use-cases. Obviously, it is not a plug in replacement for RSA. Technically a BLT signature provides more than RSA: signing time, revocation, archivability etc necessary in some legal frameworks.

crypto,37003g,ahtotruu,4,Sat May 23 20:58:10 2015 UTC,They mention Lamport Signatures in at least the first paper which I just read.  It seems the selling point is that this signature scheme does not depend on the security of the the private key. However the security of BLT does depend on an accurate clock which they say should go in a a sealed dongle. I'm not sure how they plan to secure the clock.
crypto,37003g,Natanael_L,2,Sat May 23 21:32:54 2015 UTC,The basic scheme (where keys are bound to time) indeed requires either a secure clock (hard to do in a dongle/smartcard) or the ability to extract reliable time from the time-stamp S.  More precisely the thing that is needed is to make sure there is a point in time for each key such that the key can be used for signing only before that time and is released to outside world only after that time. This condition alone ensures that only the owner of the key can use it to create signatures and everyone else can only use it for verification of existing signatures.
crypto,37003g,ahtotruu,1 point,Mon May 25 06:44:49 2015 UTC,"Then why not smartcards? :)   Also, look at Fawkes signatures for another temporally secured hash based signature method (timestamps hash commitments)."

PGP does this, for instance, so it can prompt you for the right key. The catch is that there's no way for you, as a third-party observer, to check if that statement is true or not. Since the actual cipher output is indistinguishable from random, someone could just take a block of random data, and append ""Dude this is totally ciphertext I promise,"" and since you don't have the private key you don't know any better.

Caroline will generate two secret keys on a smartcard   K_auth1, and K_auth2.  On the first encryption,  a USB stick with the document to encrypt will be inserted  to the  IN port on the  HSM,  an empty fresh USB stick will be inserted to the OUT port on the HSM.   Alice will insert her K_alice smart card, and   Caroline will insert her  K_auth1 smart card.  The HSM will encrypt the document and write to the OUT: (1)  A DOCUMENTS folder with the documents/files on the IN usb stick, but encrypted using an encryption key which will be newly generated.  (2) A file containing the document encryption key, encrypted using K_alice XOR K_auth1  (3) A file containing message digests/e.g. SHA256 hash Of:  The input document,  a hash of the Output document,   a hash of K_alice, and a hash of K_auth1.   (4) A Digital signature of the document made using K_auth1.  (5) A  DIGESTS folder with a copy of items  (3) and (4)  from any previous HSM sessions  without re-encrypting them.  The  USB stick connected to the IN port will next be removed from the HSM and tossed into a  running incinerator  in full view of all parties, to verify the unencrypted version has been destroyed.   Next, the smart cards and USB stick are removed from HSM1.   Caroline brings out HSM2. The USB stick is plugged into the in port  Caroline inserts her K_auth2 smart card.

If the two parties are in different places, then I would have to start asking about your attack models.  If you have only the ciphertext from Alice's encryption,   then you have no way of proving that Alice didn't encrypt a different plaintext with her key, and that her key wasn't intentionally selected to be guessable by Bob,  unless Alice is forced to use a crypto module you trust under supervision to ensure that Alice does not tamper with the module.  The security becomes even harder to validate if you start bringing in remote encrypted tunnels.  How do you know Alice didn't tamper with the software on her computer setting up the tunnel  to send any key material exchanged somewhere else?  You could use a tamper-resistant smartcard and public key crypto operations on the smartcard.  Things definitely get more complicated if  Alice's actions need to be proven, and you don't have an additional agent at the physical location that can testify and observe  and log the tamper-evident seals on the equipment."

I think the author abuses the ""private key encryption"" idea without mentioning it's just a signature algorithm. You can do exactly the same with DSA, ECDSA or ed25519 signature algorithms, which are not ""private key encryption"" algorithms unlike RSA.

So we already have proof that such a P2P strategy ""works"", despite the fear of many that they don't want ""all the illegal stuff"" to go through their computers.   Also, perhaps the client could make everyone an exit node by default, but somewhere deep in the settings it could still allow people to disable their client from being an exit node and make it only a relay node. Then those who are really terrified about the prospect of being an exit node can just turn that off. Win-win right?  The current strategy of having a few thousand nodes will never work, and it's only going to become worse as NSA increases its budget and capabilities. Those thousand nodes will be overwhelmed by NSA's own nodes.  Even if we turn millions of relay nodes into exit nodes I'd still worry the NSA has the capability to mess with that, but at least it would be a much smaller chance.

crypto,36vglt,Natanael_L,21,Fri May 22 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"That statement is a ridiculous urban legend if you read any of Snowden's leaks. If it were true they wouldn't need to coerce Google, Dropbox and such companies with FISA letters for access to information, or wouldn't need to tap non-encrypted inter-datacenter fiber lines in order to capture useful data, or bully Intel to death to allow them salting their random number generator, or capture Cisco shipments and physically tamper the devices, or force Lavabit to close because they didn't give them access, or create their own TOR servers to capture, correlate and patch traffic data (something semi-pro hacker groups have already been doing for years).

Not all of their staff can focus on novel research, and they're not THAT big compared to the entire rest of the world.   Their biggest advantages today is their resources and legal/political position (within the military / intelligence world).

crypto,36vglt,seattlyte,11,Fri May 22 15:09:49 2015 UTC,but they no longer have the massive advantage they used to.    Specially since the 90s when top talent stopped being captured by the government as it used to be in the past. One of the good things of the emergence of Silicon Valley is that the best people are now working for big companies rather than the government. Even NASA is experiencing this right now with the best people flocking to SpaceX and United Launch Alliance.
crypto,36vglt,me_z,5,Fri May 22 15:16:33 2015 UTC,Lets not fool ourselves: they are incredibly talented. They aren't decades ahead in encryption simply because the theory has become so good that throwing more minds and dollars at the problem has massive diminishing returns. This wasn't the case in the 70's and so they legitimately had decades advance on knowledge. But there's every reason to think that lead was impossible to maintained.
crypto,36vglt,seattlyte,4,Fri May 22 17:56:37 2015 UTC,"That's a cherry-picked list of things from the Snowden docs and it's also a highly biased narrative wrt the cherrypicked examples.  The NSA has been decrypting over 80% of VPN traffic, can attack TLS, backdoored ciphersuites, infiltrated organizations by network and by foot, can physically tamper devices, have shadow certificates, point-and-click 0day deployment, quantuminsert and MITM capabilities, have TEMPEST attacks, can bridge air gapped networks, etc. They are likely able to break 1024 bit RSA/DL, have cryptanalytic capabilities that they keep secret (these were not subject to release in the Snowden docs). Der Speigel published capabilities of the NSA to own computers at distances of 8 miles via their wireless cards.  Their use of law, coercian, deception, and impersonation are not things that they HAVE to do. They are things that they choose to do, because they work and because they are more cost and time effective.  It's true that they aren't 40 years ahead. But they are certainly a decade ahead or more ahead. It's also likely that the forced disclosure of lavabit keys was used for parallel construction - that they (FBI) already had the keys to Snowden's communications but needed to get access to them in a legal way so that they could present it in court.  But none of this addresses the spirit of the original commentator. The NSA is capable of breaking this new TOR client either by covertly backdooring the code, breaking the executable or by infiltrating exit nodes, etc. If your threat model is the NSA the only thing you can do is slow them - make it more expensive - you can not stop them. At the end of the day they are a phone call and paperwork away from the world's greatest army.  That doesn't mean slowing them isn't important. But we can't characterize the NSA as buffoons that are easy to thwart. Whether they use technical or non-technical means to achieve SIGINT, that is their charter. If you are a target they will get it."

crypto,36vglt,hackinthebochs,1 point,Sat May 23 06:01:23 2015 UTC,"If you recall, they did know about what correct S-Boxes to use back in the 1970's for DES to strengthen it against differential cryptanalysis.  At the time, everyone thought that they were using it to install a backdoor when it was actually the latter.  While they may or may not be able to break RSA/AES encryption (I'm guessing yes, but very computationally expensive) you have to admit that they possess knowledge that others don't.  Further, it's easier to backdoor your way into someone's systems and scoop up data than to try to break every piece that you come across."
crypto,36vglt,hackinthebochs,1 point,Fri May 22 17:59:02 2015 UTC,"To be fair, there are parts of Snowden's leaks (like those that discuss BULLRUN and other programs) that make reference to ""ECI"" or Extremely Compartmentalized Information - the very most secret secrets - often in proximity to discussions about compromising encrypted communications. Now, we have no idea what kind of ECI tricks they might have (we're talking about stuff that probably less than a couple hundred people - maybe even as few as a dozen - even know exists), but we do know that even with Snowden's elevated sysadmin clearance (which allowed access to many things beyond Top Secret), he was (presumably) completely in the dark about that stuff.  Of course, with any kind of capabilities like that, they're basically unusable, at least publically. And so naturally, parallel construction is essential, which can take place in the ways you describe.  Do I personally think it's likely that widely-deployed, strong crypto is routinely broken via these ECI techniques? No. But I do think that it's a possibility. Thankfully, the fact that they would never, ever, ever dare to reveal these capabilities actually makes me more or less unconcerned with it, at least for most threat models."
crypto,36vglt,Natanael_L,5,Sat May 23 06:09:07 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, there's a huge difference between circumventing the protocol and breaking the encryption. It may very well be the case that they have some mechanism that renders the encryption irrelevant in a large class of cases.

Fine, keep 1024-bit DHE support now. But where's the deadline for when you'll drop it? Maybe they didn't want to rush such a decision and perhaps we'll still see Google announce a plan like they did for SHA1.  However, I really do believe that's how the security industry needs to think from now on. Will a protocol start to look weak in 5 years? Prepare a 3 year plan to get everyone off it. Is the protocol already too weak to be considered very secure? Create an even more aggressive plan to phase it out.   This kind of mentality needs to permeate everything security related on the web from now on. No more using 2 decades old broken crypto because it just happened to remain in the software and nobody bothered to push it out ""because it might break some things"".

crypto,36kpxy,throwaway0xFF00,3,Mon May 25 04:39:33 2015 UTC,"I've been through the validation process (for Level 2).  They ask you to describe the method of source code control and require that it has versioning of some sort. (This along with the fact the code must be in a high-level language are a couple of the few checks they do on the quality of the development process.) Any real source code control system easily passes.  If you make code changes during the validation process (say, in response to something that the lab points out) then you will need to resubmit the source code and something that describes/highlights the changes. What that looks like is entirely up to you and the lab to work out.  I went through the re-validation process, but the changes were so substantial that it was almost a rewrite and we didn't get much of a leg-up from the previous validation, so I'm not sure I can be much help there."
crypto,36kpxy,B-Con,2,Wed May 20 07:08:06 2015 UTC,"I have shepherded code through this process. In other words, our company did not produce it, but we submitted it for validation. We submitted API documentation and evidence that the software was under CM control. You have to use a testing lab for your review and as far as I know, any change docs would have to satisfy them. We haven't gone through a revalidation where they need to review code changes. I imagine any modern CM system can produce diffs of the code. Docs might be nice, but I expect they care about the actual code."

What your asking and what is required by the cmvp is really a big grey area.  My recommendation is that if you guys are really going to go through this, you should seriously consider getting to labs.  One lab for validatioin, the other for consulting through the process.  It helps out a lot."

Keep in mind that the checks are not endorsements. A tick for being audited doesn't mean that the audit was thorough, but rather that they at least tried.  You need to think about your threat model. You've got some answers in here so far that may be fine, or may be the opposite of what you want. Is anonymity important to you? Are you just trying to avoid mass surveillance, or are you being specifically targeted?  iMesaage seems pretty good if you believe its design document. Way better than SMS, I'm sure it's well-tested. But it's proprietary and we ultimately have to trust that Apple isn't being evil. Ditto that for Threema. You have to look deep within yourself and decide whether you can trust corporations and government with your privacy.  For me, it must be Free software to even qualify.  There are lots of new, shiny applications out there that do neat stuff. That's great for tinkering around with, but it's not usually the case for betting your life on. Bit message and Tox, for example. Really cool stuff, but I'm not ready to trust it yet. They're not yet serious contenders, but I'll be very excited when they are.  TextSecure and Signal, while new by crypto standards, are being actively developed by security and cryptography professionals who have endeared themselves to the community through their integrity and hard work. It is seeing significant use and is under lots of scrutiny, not that that guarantees anything. I use them and recommend to all my friends. A desktop (web) client is in the works.  If you need asynchronous communication like email, OpenPGP is where it's at. No, RSA is not dead. Download GPGTools for Mac OSX and try it out. Do yourself a favor and learn it from the command line.   OTR is great for encrypted IM. Adium includes it. There are also some caveats to Pidgin and Adium, with them having a bad history with security. If mass surveillance alone is your concern, I wouldn't sweat it too much. Otherwise, keep looking or educate yourself on the weaknesses of these programs. Conversations is a client that I can tentatively recommend (Android-only).  Neither of these tools by themselves provide anonymity. You have privacy, but your adversary knows who is involved in the conversation. If you need that, download the Tor Browser and use GnuPG or OTR from there. Better yet, use the TAILS live distro. Read the docs on how to stay safe on Tor.  Just whatever you do, don't listen to Reddit comments.  Look at Wikipedia, look at what experts in the community are saying, and read the discussion among them. Try to learn how stuff works. You should know how good a 2048 bit RSA key is, or the differences between RSA and Diffie-Hellman. You should understand why the only proven unbreakable cryptosystem isn't ever used. Just make sure you're doing it for yourself, and aren't trusting Reddit. These people are misleading you, even if they're not wrong. Except Signal guy. He's fine.  Stop using Telegram until they get their protocol sorted out better and begin to see positive feedback from those who are qualified to critique it.  Reply for clarification or questions.  PM me if you need to. I'm here to help."

The RSA subkey that was factored has an invalid self-signature in hpa's public key, which means that it wasn't really hpa who added the subkey. Since the sks-keyserver pool doesn't verify signatures, anyone could have inserted that subkey. So anyone could have purposefully picked an exploitable RSA subkey, added a fake signature to it, and uploaded it to the sks-keyserver pool. Luckily, GPG will drop the subkey when retrieving hpa's public key since it doesn't have a valid self-signature. But for anyone scanning all the public keys without verifying signatures (for research, etc.), this key might get recognized and cause a shitstorm. Which is exactly what has happened. So far, there's no evidence that there is a conspiracy to weaken RSA keys. There is only evidence that someone inserted a bogus subkey into hpa's public key. There will be evidence of a conspiracy if we find a weak RSA key in the strongset that has a valid self-signature."

Sure, they picked a bunch of defaults so that anyone can type Encrypt without knowing stuff, but it's not usable in the sense that anyone could pick this up and get a secure construction. AES in CBC mode, it's not even like there's an HMAC lying around, so no one is actually going to get a properly authenticated encryption construct (there aren't even AEAD modes, like GCM, available). The RSA stuff is in PKCS1v1.5 mode, which has many known problems, not OAEP by default, and the docs blindly demonstrate encrypting with the private key without explaining why (hint: it doesn't provide confidentiality), or providing a signature API at all.

This makes for an easy known-plaintext attack. Your key has at most 64 bits of entropy, which is trivially brute forceable with today's hardware.

Some statistics / probability for things such as hashing and symmetric crypto.   Things started to get complicated when we went into lattice based crypto, and the mathematical proofs behind some of the problems such as the shortest vector (SVP). Advanced notions such as homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs were quite a challenge too, but the math part was more of a bonus than anything really.

A password typed on a phone can be expected to be mostly lower case letters with a potentially capital letter at the beginning and 0-2 numbers/symbols at the end. Distribution of numbers used for these things are not even, nor are the symbols. Knowing some information about the target allows targeting. You'd probably find the password at least a third of the time. Probably a lot more often."

The fact that the derived key is used for AES is pretty much irrelevant, for a brute-force attacker the computation is dominated by building the dictionary of mediocre passwords using PBKDF2.  Feel free to quantify ""mediocre password"", say more about the system including if it uses salts, identify your attackers hardware (or custom ASIC), and make an estimate."

I am operating under the assumption that this step is trivial. Although I have taken precautions to prevent standard steganography detection methods, Schneier's law applies here.  The attacker reverse engineers the encoding algorithm (which I also assume will be trivial) and obtains the ciphertext, salt, and IV.

The /r/didthemath claims the Tianhe-2 supercomputer (which is still at the top of the list could compute 3.386e16 keys per seconds. At that rate, it would take all of 29 nanoseconds to go through that list of almost 1 billion words.  But let's ignore the Tianhe-2 since that's clearly the upper end of performance. Even then:   If you are using PBKDF2 and have 1,000 iterations, then a hacker with specialised hardware will guess 1 billion passwords in about 20 seconds. That's not very good security at all.

Let's also assume you've built your app so that some side channel attack (like someone just opening the app to see photos) is not possible. Since you say brute force the password and not guess, there are two ways to go about it. An attacker could try to brute force the key, which would take practically forever, or they could try to brute force the password. Brute forcing the password takes exponential time if the attacker already knows the length of the password. Let's just say it takes t ms to derive a 1k iteration pkdf key. Let's say the attacker has access to a couple ec2 instances giving him c cores and plenty of ram. For a l character password it would take on the order of 94l *t/c ms to brute force the password. Reasonable values for c would be in the thousands for an individual with a limited budget.  Hopefully you can graph that function and it gives you an idea of what you're looking for."

crypto,35u4f9,cunttard,2,Thu May 14 01:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yes. Here is the draft:  We are going to talk about everyone's favourite topic - a prime factorisation.   Admit it, we all like to play with primes when nobody is watching. There is nothing to be ashamed about.   Let's look at the simple case where we have a number N which is a product of two different odd factors p and q.  What can we tell about these factors? Only that p is somewhere below a square root and q is somewhere above.  Not much fun in ""somewhere"".  Unless we start looking at squares modulo N.  For that, we will introduce another reference point which is a half of a number, labeled as h.  Here is the example set of squares for 21.  As you can see, there are two interesting fixed points. Let’s label them b and d.  What are the properties of these points? We see that a square of a value is equal to the value and a square of difference between points is equal to 1. Modulo N.  Another interesting property is that b is a product of some number and p. As well as d is a product of some number and q.  But most interesting property is that b and d are symmetric relatively to h.  Now let's get real and visualise.  Here we have two graphs where the blue line represents y=x2 mod 21 and the green one represents y=x. Aside of 1, you can see that the only integer intersections between two graphs are at the fixed points (red).  Let's take a look at another visualisation. Here we represent N=527 as a circle, clockwise. After we put the reference and fixed points we will have this picture.   Those of us who is old enough should recognise something familiar here.  There are couple more examples of other numbers. The presence of fixed points and their properties are universal.  So, over years we spent a lot of efforts trying to figure out how to hunt for those sneaky p and q. Maybe we will do better with b and d?  So, let's refocus and have some fun."
crypto,35u4f9,LtFrank,1 point,Thu May 14 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"Very cute. But you still have to search for b and d. However if you find the one you have the other. You will notice in the example of N=21 that b and d are 4 ""searches"" away from h. This is similar search space to searching all primes < N0.5. The fact that you only search for b2 = b (modN), etc, doesn't reduce complexity all that much. I.e. by a multiple not an order.... This will hold for all N.   Having said that it may be very useful in another branch of attack. Your choice of nomenclature of h is of particular interest. I presume it is for half, and not something fancier"

crypto,35rr43,bren2010,3,Tue May 12 23:34:23 2015 UTC,"The author does a pretty good job describing what a monotone access structure is, though it is rather terse.  Access structures are standard fare in the literature of secret sharing.   To clarify, an access structure can be thought of as a list of sets of people: a set of people on that list should be granted access to the secret, and a set of people not on that list should not be.  And monotone just means that any superset of a set of people on that list should also be on that list.  The standard example you learn from threshold t-out-of-n secret sharing induces an access structure: all sets of t or more people are on the access list.  So if Alice, Bob and Charlie are the three participants, then the 2-out-of-3 access structure looks like {Alice,Bob},{Alice,Charlie},{Bob,Charlie},{Alice,Bob,Charlie}.  If you wanted Alice alone to also be able to recover the secret, then you add {Alice} to that list.   MSPs generalize threshold secret sharing to allow for arbitrarily complex monotone access structures.  However, there are combinatorial lower bounds as well as computationally hard bounds (formula minimization is somewhere like Sigma2 or Pi2 on the polynomial hierarchy) on how to most efficiently create a scheme for a given access structure."
crypto,35rr43,DoWhile,2,Wed May 13 05:26:25 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of the combinatorial ECDSA threshold signature scheme that was designed for use with Bitcoin (implemented in secp256k1, can be used outside Bitcoin wherever the same curve is supported).  They allow for similar constructions where you can define multiple alternative threshold values depending on which members participate, such as (A + B) and/or C.   For small thresholds, computing a signature over the online protocol takes on the order of 10 seconds. I'm hoping they can make it more efficient. That slowness a side effect of applying the ECDSA threshold math in a combinatorial setup, it adds a significant overhead. They practically create multiple threshold setups and then link them together with further threshold setups (AFAICT)."

crypto,35lrmm,shreyasonline,23,Mon May 11 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"Your challenge-response mechanism for passworded chat groups looks a bit broken. Offending source.  Problems:   You use the default Random class, which is based upon an LCG, which can be predicted. You're seeding the RNG based upon the millisecond component of the UTC date (DateTime.UtcNow.Millisecond), which can be trivially bruteforced - there are only 1000 possible seeds at most. You ""seed"" the CHAP with the public key XML, which would be known to an attacker.   I could see this exploited in the following way:   You can use the padding (line 231) to leak direct PRNG outputs and determine the state, which allows you to predict all future PRNG outputs. Since the random challenge is seeded with the public key XML, which is publicly known, the only unknown after the PRNG is broken is the full UTC binary timestamp, which can be guessed rather easily. This means you can predict all future challenges. Now you can predict future challenges, you ARP spoof a client to point to you, then use the legitimate client as an oracle to sign future challenges that you guess will come up on the server (you just need to hit the right UTC timestamp) and you can use that to bypass the authentication and join the chat group.   My recommendation is to use RngCryptoServiceProvider CSPRNG instead of a plain PRNG when generating the challenge tokens, and HMAC-SHA256 rather than plain SHA256 for authentication - this is exactly what HMAC is intended for."
crypto,35lrmm,gsuberland,4,Mon May 11 23:37:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the analysis. I should have used a secure RNG in first place.  Few points for knowing the protocol:   if a chat group identifier is known by attacker (by sniffing network for udp/http torrent tracker queries), attacker can know the ip address:port for peers in the chat. the protocol is peer to peer so the connecting peer becomes client and the listening peer becomes server. So, a peer can be both client and server depending on the direction. the challenge-response mechanism's purpose here is to prevent attacker to proceed with cert exchange and get identity of the victim without completing the protocol handshake. if attacker manages to crack the chat group password, he can connect to any peer in that group and read the cert and know their identity. if attacker completes the protocol handshake, his profile gets listed in the user interface and his cert can be seen by the victim. the RSA keys used in the profile are not permanent. users can get a new profile certificate reissued anytime. public key is not tied with user's identity.

You look like you've done your homework so any response needs to go into details, which unfortunately, will require a lot of effort that I'm not prepared to commit to at the moment.  The short answer is that ad-hoc white-box crypto is probably going to be insecure, and that secure attempts should be viewed from the perspective of mathematical obfuscation.  While general VBB mathematical obfuscation has been ruled out by Barak et al. there are several classes of functions that do admit VBB mathematical obfuscation, and there are also weaker variants of obfuscation (that do not necessarily achieve the ""goals"" of white-box crypto) that are secure.  Lumping the two together is kind of a disservice to the theoretical community, though the people who created mathematical obfuscation kind of admit they fucked up naming the thing the same as something else that is, typically, bullshit.  I'll end on a positive note about (theoretical) positive benefits of obfuscation: secure patching in open-source software.  Right now, when you release code for a security patch, hackers are the first to jump on it and try to find a 0day.  Under certain circumstances, it is better to release an obfuscated patch so that people can patch their systems, then after a certain grace period, release the unobfuscated code to it."

The whole point of the paper is to figure out exactly what property is required of the hash function to achieve some level of obfuscation (without resorting to random oracle assumption). Earlier work by Lynn-Prabhakaran-Sahai showed that, yes indeed, a random oracle gives a natural point function obfuscation. So if you're happy with SHA256 being a random oracle, then your construction is fine (except you need to do:   ObfPointFunc x = sha256(x,r) == ""hardcoded""   for randomly chosen r also hard-coded.

In particular, you can obfuscate two points such that if either point hits, you evaluate to ""true"" but you won't know which point was hit.  This is something that just hashing won't give you easily, though the actual implementation is so inefficient you probably don't want to use it.  Regarding your example of point-function obfuscation, if you assume your hash function is a (programmable) random oracle, then it basically works as a good point-obfuscator.  In practice, it's a believable and reasonably reliable assumption, but in theory it is unfounded as there are impossibility results that tell you random oracles cannot be instantiated by hash functions... so really you're relying on a mathematically-unfounded-but-practically-reasonable assumption.  (In fact, from a theoretical point of view, most hashes and block ciphers are just ""ad-hoc"" designs with no solid mathematical foundation beyond what is known by cryptanalysts.)  The goal of ""secure"" cryptography is to build problems upon assumptions that are believed to be hard, rather than just building a scheme that is believed to be hard.  Thus, for any purported design, if you can't discern what the underlying hard assumption is, there should be some doubt.  Recent theoretical obfuscation schemes (both VBB and weaker variants such as iO/diO/eO/VGB/...) are based on mathematical/computational foundations, though it still remains to be seen if those are hard to solve or not."

This is a property of D-H key agreement and also why D-H based algorithm can't really be used to encrypt anything on their own, you need someway to use the shared secret for bulk encryption.  You can't use a random number as public key either, it needs to be a valid public key derived from a valid private key (read up on various ECC curves and you'll see some fairly complex generation scheme for private keys generation and public key derivation to make sure they are legal.)

So as I use a BIP32 hierarchically deterministic tree of key pairs, I could pick keys from there in a sequence, sending from any of those keys to myself.  Apparently I drew false conclusions from bitcore-ecies' getting-started that look an awful lot like Alice and Bob communicating with rather static keys. So assuming bitcore fixes above mentioned bug/actually has no bug due to some magic, the example should not be  var alice = ECIES()   .privateKey(aliceKey)   .publicKey(bobKey.publicKey); var encrypted = alice.encrypt(message);   but rather  var alice = ECIES()   .privateKey(new PrivateKey()) // new random private key thus no authentication possible   .publicKey(bobKey.publicKey); var encrypted = alice.encrypt(message);   (I wonder what library would be easy and advisable to use, given we have these nice bitcoin HD keys. I told my boss that using PGP would probably not have the same issues and that we could instantiate PGP keys from the bitcoin keys using openPGP.js which has an API pretty much as simple as above example but we delayed this decision at least until we heard back from bitpay and will get proper audits anyway.)"

For details on how it works, see Stevens' CRYPTO 2013 paper Counter-cryptanalysis (.pdf) or Stevens' EUROCRYPT 2013 paper New collision attacks on SHA-1 based on optimal joint local-collision analysis (.pdf). If interested in the MD5 part (only available in libdetectcoll-0.2), look at these slides (.pdf) and the resources related to HashClash.  libdetectcoll-1.0 was released on May 7th 2015 and presented on May 8th during Security in Times of Surveillance at TU Eindhoven. The author, Marc Stevens, states that the new release ""protects against twice as many SHA-1 attack classes (disturbance vectors), but is 9 times faster than previous version. Speed is now 1.87 times normal SHA-1."" (the latter meaning that collision detection, based on differential paths, is less than twice the cost of computing the normal SHA-1 hash).  Given an input file, it looks for differential paths, which are indicators of certain collision attacks based on 'local collisions'. If it finds a collision, it shows the SHA1 hash and the marking ""*coll*"":  $ bin/sha1dcsum_partialcoll tools/test/sha1_reducedsha_coll.bin dd39885a2a5d8f59030b451e00cb45da9f9d3828 *coll* tools/test/sha1_reducedsha_coll.bin   If no local collision is found, it only shows the SHA1 hash:  $ bin/sha1dcsum_partialcoll tools/test/md5_4a.exe  0033f995a30fd2ccbf60cc1e7d7db9e649397668  tools/test/md5_4a.exe    To compile on OS X you may need to change 'libtool' to 'glibtool' in the Makefile (see variables LT_CC and LT_LD)."

Key tree: the representation of the whole domain of keys used by an organization in a tree-based format. Master key(s): the key(s) that have the skeleton key as their direct parent key. Parent key(s): key(s) that have children key(s). Children key(s): key(s) that have a parent key. Sibling keys: multiple keys that have the same parent key. Root key: the key that is used to follow a path to arrive at a desired child key. not to be confused with the skeleton key, although it COULD be the skeleton key in certain circumstances.    If you have a tree, where A is the parent to B, C, D, and A is the highest node in the tree, why do you need any more than the Root, Parent, Child, and Sibling relationships?   Parents have one or more children keys Parents may themselves have parents. The root has no parent and is the highest ancestor of any key in the tree Any two keys are siblings if they have a common parent.   The first three properties define the Child, Parent, Grandparent.. relationships via induction.

Basically SKC works like this:   Every key in the key tree (excluding the skeleton key) is named.   This name can be anything, such as a number or letter (as used in my examples), or it can be actual names such as ""advertising_team"". The naming scheme that is used is determined by the organization.  To generate a new key, you take its name and its parent key and you concatenate them and then hash it with SHA-256 to give you a 256 digest that may be used as an encryption key. So basically the parent key is the value that is hashed, and the key name is the salt.   With this method, you are able to generate ANY key using the skeleton key, and child keys aren't able to generate their parent keys.  If a key is compromised, every single child key and their descendants becomes compromised. Any sibling keys and the parent key ARE not compromised.

The end-result will be roughly the same: To get a node key from a parent, or grandparent key you need to do one database lookup plus one crypto-algorithm per node in the path. In your case you look up a salt per node and hash, in my case you look up the encrypted node key and decrypt.  What makes your system better?"

He has a computer science degree at Stanford was also the only one to personally answer my complaints on the Trans Pacific Partnership transparency issues. Barbara Boxer and Feinstein sent me a typical automated reply and never heard from them again.   Excerpt from Ted Lieu in this video:    ""It’s a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem. Why do you think Apple and Google are doing this? It’s because the public is demanding it. People like me: privacy advocates. A public does not want an out-of-control surveillance state. It is the public that is asking for this. Apple and Google didn’t do this because they thought they would make less money. This is a private sector response to government overreach.  Then you make another statement that somehow these companies are not credible because they collect private data. Here’s the difference: Apple and Google don’t have coercive power. District attorneys do, the FBI does, the NSA does, and to me it’s very simple to draw a privacy balance when it comes to law enforcement and privacy: just follow the damn Constitution.  And because the NSA didn’t do that and other law enforcement agencies didn’t do that, you’re seeing a vast public reaction to this. Because the NSA, your colleagues, have essentially violated the Fourth Amendment rights of every American citizen for years by seizing all of our phone records, by collecting our Internet traffic, that is now spilling over to other aspects of law enforcement. And if you want to get this fixed, I suggest you write to NSA: the FBI should tell the NSA, stop violating our rights. And then maybe you might have much more of the public on the side of supporting what law enforcement is asking for.  Then let me just conclude by saying I do agree with law enforcement that we live in a dangerous world. And that’s why our founders put in the Constitution of the United States—that’s why they put in the Fourth Amendment. Because they understand that an Orwellian overreaching federal government is one of the most dangerous things that this world can have. I yield back.""   Simply incredible. What’s also incredible is that it takes an immigrant to remind the American public that the Constitution still matters.

Would 9/11 have happened if there were adequate intelligence sharing with these capabilities?  We don't know.  But I am sure there are family members of ~3000 people who would like to know.    I don't mean to be dramatic, but I think if there were a well regulated capability, it might be worth it.  Then fundamentally we get to the issue of trust.

In 2001, over a decade ago, a well-organized terrorist attack killed around 3,000 people in the US. It was awful.  However, in 2001 over 30,000 people in the US were killed in automobile accidents. The same was true for each other year in the last several decades. (See US CDC death statistics or DoT accident statistics.)  So, the auto accident problem is quite a bit larger, in human death cost, than the best shot terrorists have taken. Two orders of magnitude larger at least. As risk managers, maybe we should look at that problem first as it is much larger.  What is the technical solution to this problem? Do we mandate self-driving cars for all? [1]  The point of terrorism is to scare us, to make us do things not in our interest. I know a hostile act seems different than accidents, but really it's not. We should not let fear of some hypothetical act determine our response.  [1: And if we do, will those cars support remote operation? Would that remote operation be protected by backdoored crypto?]"

Think about the most successful biological attacks in the US (the Rajneeshi group in Oregon), or the most successful chemical attack (aum sri rukiyo in Japan) or the DC snipers, or that Oklahoma City asshole, or the Unabomber... These groups or individuals all succeeded because they had good operational security. None of them would have used software with known back doors to communicate. Especially after all the publicity this issue has had!  Conversely the attacks that have been foiled have been penetrated by human agents from the earliest stages. It's never email snooping that stops them. (Though it may aid in getting a conviction later.)

Could you please reply why this would technically not be possible? The video goes to great length saying that if only we could keep only the bad guys out, it would be a good idea and how ""our"" great nation should be capable to fix the technical details blabla and only very briefly touches on the moral aspects. I'm concerned that with this take on the matter, they could vote in favor if they come to conclusions to which I came but that would still be the wrong thing to do. Can't we discuss this here?  I don't want to advocate for backdoors but a dictatorship that wanted this backdoor, disregarding that the market is global and others want a backdoor, too, I see no fundamental issue of having legal interception keys – one per every user per every app. Those keys could get disclosed by an institution on a case by case basis, publishing at the same time the public key associated with the private key, so that abuse can be detected.  I'm into bitcoin. Use HD keys. Every company gets an account in the tree that only the gov. knows the root of, and the root extended public key is public, so all can know the entirety of all public keys.  Disclaimer: I am developing Bitcoin tools and probably would lead the revolt against a surveillance state but I don't see why it would technically not be possible."
crypto,354qh3,giszmo,17,Thu May 7 03:35:46 2015 UTC,"Your system, as you described it, would be based on the trust of the institution that handles the keys. Which means we have here a central point of failure.   For instance, let's assume the NSA thinks it's too much a hassle to ask for a warrant on a case-to-case basis and wants to have unencrypted traffic of everyone. If the NSA manages to implement a backdoor into the institution, the NSA would have access to all the keys in an unlimited fashion and wouldn't need a warrant anymore. (Same goes for foreign intelligence agencies if you consider the NSA as ""the good guy"")   So that means that the security of any app/program would depend on the security of the institution, and as a software developer or user you can do nothing except hope that the institution didn't get hacked. This is if all work as planned and  the institution only cooperate with a lawful warrant.  So to sum up, such a backdoor system would, even in the best case be flawed, and it would only be a matter of time for someone to hack it, thus rendering all encryption pointless."
crypto,354qh3,dafukwasdat,1 point,Thu May 7 11:11:44 2015 UTC,So it boils down to the op sec of the key holder? Is that what you are saying?

Thank you for answering by the way.
crypto,354qh3,giszmo,5,Thu May 7 14:39:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. There is no absolute security. You must consider that every intelligence agency, every hacker, every mafia would want to crack this system. Even if just one fifth of the keys gets leaked, it's still one fifth of the users of US apps/software that gets exposed, that's an enormous amount of data that could be collected."
crypto,354qh3,dafukwasdat,2,Thu May 7 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"You got me wrong. A fifth of each key. A hacker would have to compromise all institutions to get anything at all.  Assuming that the institutions would cooperate against crimes but not for espionage they could cooperate accross nations on a very limited amount of serious cases.  Scheme, assuming familiarity with bitcoin and its hierarchically deterministic keys: Each institution has to create an HDPrivateKey xpriv and share its corresponding xpub publicly. Each software service picks any point in that hierarchy at will and applies this derivation to the 5 xpub keys. It then further derives for each customer an individual public key. xpub.derive(companyOffset).derive(customerOffset).pubKey. Using this pubKey for encryption but not sharing the company offset would even add the company as a further party LE would have to ask for the key.  So the data would be encrypted using some encrypt(encrypt(encrypt(data,key1),key2),key3).   Supposedly there is crypto experts here and you refuse to discuss approaches? Come on please share your thoughts."
crypto,354qh3,giszmo,5,Thu May 7 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"Yes this approach would require to hack all 5 institutions but that doesn't change the fact that you (as user or software developer) are not in control of your security and that you have no guarantee that someone hasn't hacked all 5 of them.  Also, the people here refuse to discuss technical approaches with you because it is simply impossible to have a cryptographic secure software with a backdoor. Here is why; if you have a software that is build on a encryption scheme that relies on an external authority, your system is only as secure as this external authority. As you don't control this authority, you rely on it to have an excellent security. Therefore it is no more secure than any closed source security software, which is bad (very bad)."

SolarDesigner showed that with scrypt, the area-time product (Memory Required * # of blocks processed) can be lowered to a floor of 1/4 of a naive implementation, but no lower. scrypt was also designed to use large amounts of memory, where large is 4mb at the minimum, and scaling to however much memory you can afford to use. You should either be paying through the nose on memory to build scrypt ASICs, or you will have to build so many scrypt cores to make up for the lack of memory that you won't be saving any money.

You're trying to treat these pieces of data like passwords, so do just that - treat them exactly like you would if they actually were passwords. To the folks that say this is overkill, I understand, but better safe than sorry.  Step 1: Every instance of any particular securable should have its own salt:   Read the user's <email, password, phone number> Generate salt for this piece of data - a large amount of random bits generated from a cryptographically secure random number generator. Compute dataHash = Concat( salt, Hash( Concat( salt, data ) ) ) Store dataHash and salt in the database.   Remember, every instance of data should have its own salt. If you have 5 users each with three securables (a password, an email, a phone number), then you have 15 pieces of data and thus 15 salts. Current guidance suggests 32-byte to 64-byte salts.  The above is wrong, however, because it treats Hash() like an HMAC.  Step 2: Use iterated, keyed hashing  You want to make hashing slow to slow down brute forcing or building of lookup tables. This is done by iterated hashing, but doing this securely boils down to inventing your own security primitive, and remember the rules there: don't do it. Use a keyed hashing algorithm that uses the salt as the key.   Instead, consider using PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt. scrypt is more resilient to GPU/ASIC attacks, whereas PBKDF2 and bcrypt can be implemented pretty cheaply in hardware and thus can be parallelized with relatively lower cost.  Something like Concat( salt, PBKDF2(HMAC−SHA2-256, <data>, salt, 8192, 256)) is a reasonable application.   More information  All of this is easy in PHP; most of this is in the standard library or available from openssl.   For more information: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet  Also: some dont's:   Don't try to implement your own HMAC; it's pretty easy to try to make one by doing something like SHA256(Concat(salt,data)), but that can be insecure; particularly, MD5 is vulnerable to length extension attacks when used as such, but the actual HMAC standard for MD5 thwarts this attack. That said, MD5 is trash now, so don't use it for anything except as an example for how rolling your own HMAC can be stupid. Don't use one salt for the entire database. Don't use one salt for each user Don't re-use salts, ever, for anything. Don't use MD5 for anything, or use anything that uses MD5 Don't use SHA-1 for new development; many new attacks are being discovered quickly, and it uses a merkle-damgard construction like MD5 and so may end up being found weak like MD5."

To the folks that say this is overkill, I understand, but better safe than sorry.   I don't mean to diss you on this and there is a lot of good advice there but no they do not function as passwords.  We have passwords that function as passwords.  They function as password reset channels.    I'm going to explain how we are doing this because I think what passes as standard account management in the mobile world is really awful.  We are trying hard to be different and better.  First off - we are a social network - there is nothing of financial value in our system.  Just a bunch of user made up names, a lot of links to kind of blurry low-res phone sized photos, and some short one or two line sentences that are all purged every single day.  We don't keep anything longer than that apart from ""account"" and ""follower"" data (lists of other users).  Second - we are mobile only.  There is no web interface.  Thus, we concluded that asking users to make up passwords is stupid.  Your phone is your identity.  We have something like a password - but we make it up for you and put it in your iOS keychain.  You never see it.  You can't get it. The app can't get it from the keychain unless you unlock your phone.  All you have to do is pick a user name.  Done.  I delete every mobile app that asks for more than a user name because asking people to manage passwords manually when machines can do it better is just dumb and lazy thinking.  If you let users pick passwords they pick something weak like Broncos1 or something equally lame - but nearly every mobile app I've downloaded in the last year does this and I refuse to play.  Our passwords are chunks of random data and are much longer than the average person would type and the user couldn't share it if he wanted to.  K, so the actual password is stored in the user's key chain which is tied to his iCloud account.  However, we have begun to encounter users who don't have iTunes/iCloud accounts.  Kids with iP[ao]ds and stuff.  This still works ok - but if they lose their device there is no way to recover their identity.  The marketdroids wanted a way to securely allow them to recover access to their account.  Phones can get text messages or emails - so we decided to let them register these as ""account recovery methods"" working off the theory that they have email or SMS access that is reasonably secure.  This means I have to be able to associate an email address and/or a phone number with an account - but should our data store become compromised, I don't want to give up a pile of valid phone numbers and email addresses.  Now, the data store is a NoSQL datastore - key value thing.  If a user wants access to his account back, I can let him tell me his phone number and then - knowing only that - I have to identify his account.  Which means I have a key in the NoSQL store that can be derived from his phone number - without being his phone number - which I can use to locate his account.  If I salt the phone number hash - then I can't look up the key because it will not match exactly.  Ditto the email.  I MUST NOT SALT these hashes or they will not function as lookup keys.  Anyhow, it isn't like guessing a phone number gets you a lot because what will happen is a SMS message will be sent to that phone with an application specific url containing a randomly generated key.  The user will tap that url, which will open our app, which will contact the server to fetch the associated payload, which is the username and new password.  This happens entirely in the mobile app out of sight.  The password is stored in the keychain and the user has his account access back.  The main goal is to prevent bad people from getting phone number or emails tied to our users' handles and use the information to phish them should somehow our database become compromised (which seems unlikely but better safe than sorry).  That is the only vulnerability I can see but I'm willing to be educated on other issues.    The alternative is to do what everyone else does which is store the email and phone number as part of their user record but I'd rather not have that info lying around."

No need to defend against side channel attacks when the attacker is executing the algorithm.  The defender executes the algorithm on sensitive input only once, to store the digest. Any attacker-triggered verifications are executed on attacker-provided input, so these provide no information about protected data.  If the attacker can force legitimate, user triggered verification that uses protected data, the timing side channel is still not useful because the number of operations is constant. Any slight variation in execution time does not help you with brute forcing. You need another side channel for another angle of attack.  If you do have a side channel that gets you information because of the algorithm, this informs you only of the state of the 64kB block after 2048 SHA-256 hashes.

I'm qualified to do that analysis myself, and I fundamentally disagree with you.  True, I do not currently check for XORing a block against itself. The probability of doing that is about 1 in 218 instructions. It loses about 12 bytes of entropy from a 64 kB block.  But I can afford to lose a lot of entropy. To retain the strength of a 32-byte hash, all I need is 32 bytes of entropy left in the block. At 100,000 operations, it is astronomically unlikely that a loss will be noticeable.  If I run the algorithm long enough for losses to be noticeable, the likelihood of loss per instruction is further reduced. With half entropy lost, the probability of further loss per instruction is now 2-19. It takes 229 - 230 operations to even get to 1/2 lost. If we run the algorithm further, we need another 230 - 231 operations to get to 3/4 lost. Then the chance of further loss per instruction grows closer to 2-20, and so on.  You need double the number of instructions to progress further for each level of loss. You need to progress through 10-11 levels to threaten the viability of the output. To get from second to last level to last one, you'll need to process on the order of 240 instructions.  Yes, if you run the algorithm forever, you need to have perfect loss mitigation. But I'm not running it forever. At 100,000 ops or even 1,000,000 ops, losses are completely negligible."

EM leaks and such can reveal internal state which enables bruteforce to be much more targeted, as the attacker doesn't need to run the full function as he can verify if the code execution behaves as on the  target's electronics or not, before completion.   Any verifications are executed on attacker-provided input, so these provide no information about protected data.   You're assuming this will only be used server side.

crypto,34ob0x,brutetime,78,Sun May 3 00:31:16 2015 UTC,"Generally, it's quoted with today's computing power.   But in the limit, modern AES encryption using a 256 bit key is unbreakable in our universe. That fact is based not on computing power available today, or in the future, but on the limits of thermodynamics, plank time, and all the energy output of the sun.  With a 128 bit key, in the absolute thermodynamic limit of efficiency, if you dedicated all electricity generated by a typical nuclear reactor to the problem (< 1 MW), it would take 400 years to try all keys. On average you could expect to reach it in half that time.  In reality, computers operate much less efficiently than the thermodynamic upper bound, making those numbers orders of magnitude higher.   Cracking 256 bit or 128 bit keys is not where it's at. You want to attack something at its weakest point: the password. And this is where we get to your actual question.  A good password scheme has maybe ~44 bits of entropy. Most companies have policies that prevent users from using good password; instead limiting them to maybe 28 bits of entropy.  That works out to:   44 bits: 17,592,186,044,416 keys 28 bits: 268,435,456 keys   And now we come to your question: how many keys can we try in a second? How many keys can we expect our attacker to be able to try in a second?  The answer is: your guess is as good as anyone else's.  But in order to have a better guess, you have to know the algorithm being used, and how quickly one CPU can compute it. Then multiply that by the budget of your attacker.  For example, if the password is stored only with SHA256 (a poor choice).  - assuming the fastest processor can compute a password in 66 cycles - and the fastest processor is 3.1 GHz  That works out to 47M guesses per second.  It would take   17,592,186,044,416 / 47M  = 374,301 s = 4.3 days   to try them all. But in reality (hopefully), no system uses simply SHA2 for password storage. Hopefully they use something more expensive:   PBKDF2 bcrypt scrypt   These algorithms have a tunable cost. The general recommendation is that it is tuned so that it takes about 200ms to compute a password on a modern computer. This means that on a single modern computer, it would take about:  17,592,186,044,416 * 0.2s = 3,518,437,208,883 s = 111,495 years   If you can throw 1,000,000 processors at that, you can calculate it in a month. But how likely is that.  A modern Xeon processor consumes about 155W. A typical nuclear power plant can put out less than 1 MW. This means that for every 1MW, you can have:  1,000,000W / 155W = 6,451 processors   Meaning that if you could dedicate an entire power plant to breaking on person's password, it would take:  111,495 years / 6,451 = 17.2 years   If you dedicated 25 power plants to breaking someone's password, you could have it in 7 months.  But does anyone take Moore's Law into it? Not really. We could, but at some point you decide it's not worth it. Additionally, Moore's Law has not been keeping pace. The speed of computers was doubling every 18 months. But since around 2004 processors have only been doubling every 3 or 4 years. Moore's law wasn't actually computer speed, it was process size (nanometers). And Intel has nearly reached the limit of process size. Instead they are adding more processing power (essentially more computers per CPU). Rather than being able to calculate a single password faster, it can calculate more passwords at the same time.  And then there's the possibility of parallelization, and computing your passwords in parallel in dedicated hardware and GPUs. This is where algorithms like bcrypt and scrypt are useful because they require memory accesses (scrypt much more so than bcrypt). This limits how many passwords you can be computing in parallel on a video card.  And this has been a whole lot of rambling for an hour and a half. And i don't think i even answered your question. But i've been authoring it for so long i don't want to just hit Cancel."

crypto,34lyjx,Natanael_L,2,Sat May 2 16:45:34 2015 UTC,Right. I was thinking of a brute force attack scenario in which the database has been compromised and the attacker has the ZKP verifier data.  But a brute force attack that doesn't compromise the server seems the same to me. With a server-side password hashing you would get one attempt per user authentication as well would you not?  As I imagine it with a zero knowledge proof you'd be going through that same list of passwords that you would for a hash but with the difference being that you don't just send it as plain text over TLS.  To me the advantage to ZKP is that if the database or application server is rooted that even with access to all the information sent to the server you cannot re-generate the user's password (which is useful in containing the security breach when users use the same passwords on lots of sites).

For some services, a lock-out is appropriate, but more-often-then-not tarpitting is a safer solution: if after e.g. failures you limit the frequency of login attempts, you can dramatically reduce the risk.  It's also worth remembering that locking (or tarpitting) by-username doesn't protect against an attacker who doesn't care which accounts they compromise from brute-forcing by trying each of the top N common-passwords (where N is the lockout limit) against each different username in turn. So any locking or tarpitting strategy should also consider whether this is a threat and to take whatever measures are appropriate to mitigate it."

crypto,34hj43,voodoomagicman,17,Fri May 1 05:03:48 2015 UTC,"The formal construction you're looking for is a message authentication code (MAC), which is basically a symmetric form of signing. (In other words, MACs are to conventional digital signatures as symmetric encryption algorithms like AES are to asymmetric encryption algorithms like RSA: there's only one key, used for both creating and verifying MACs, instead of a private/public key like you may be used to seeing with digital signatures.) In particular, there's a popular MAC algorithm called HMAC that's similar to what you propose. It involves two hashes in a particular way, instead of just one hash, to avoid specific security issues with popular hash functions.  One word of caution with using MACs as bearer tokens like this (i.e., a secret that fully authenticates anyone who knows it, instead of being part of a larger check) is that they're not revocable. Maybe this is fine for your application, although if so, I'd be extra careful about your randomly-generated user IDs to make sure that there's no chance of a user ID being reused (since an old bearer token is sufficient to log in as the current user with that ID). More practically, you may want to include an expiration timestamp or something along with the username, when making up the token. If so, come up with some sort of unambiguous encoding for the contents of the token (I'm partial to JSON, 'cause it's easy to implement in so many languages: perhaps something like {""user"": ""ldpreload"", ""expires"": 1430545276}). Then you accept the encoded contents as well as the MAC, make sure the MAC verifies, and make sure the expiration date hasn't hit yet.  You can extend this to store any information that the user is allowed to know and not modify, to avoid persistently storing that server-side. Authorization information (what permissions they have) tends to be in this category. You could also store additional constraints (like client IP address, although that's of limited value and may not be useful for your use case).  At that point you might want a proper standard / library for doing this. Django has one, for instance; I suppose there are probably a few others intended for use with web frameworks. (And they also recommend JSON.) There's also Macaroons, which are new-ish and don't have many implementations, but have a bunch of cool features, and worry about things like expiry / revocation.  Re hash function, personally I would only consider SHA-256 or stronger for new applications. If you can't fit a 256-bit (32-byte) hash, regardless of what hash function you're using, you're not meeting a reasonable security strength factor. For some applications (possibly including this one) you can be less conservative, but that's definitely in the realm of ""writing your own crypto,"" in the sense of ""I'm asserting that I'm a real cryptographer here and have analyzed this particular protocol,"" and even though I have a (tiny) bit of solid academic crypto background, I really like not relying on that."

A disadvantage is that it makes your public IDs longish and random."

However, Moxie and his team have consistenly promoted Whatsapp as ""secure"" already because of that ""unfinished implementation"". They even had a small argument on Twitter with Telegram over it saying that Whatsapp is more secure than Telegram because of it.  I do agree Telegram encryption sucks, but I don't think they should say Whatsapp is so much more secure, because at this point Whatsapp's E2E encryption is nothing more but ""vaporware"". Until Whatsapp resolves the 3 issues I mentioned above, that's exactly what it is.

The problem is that the ""if"" in the BADA55 argument is a pretty big one.  The BADA55 attack only works IF the attacker knows of a weakness in elliptic curves that nobody else knows AND nobody else is able to discover even when presented with examples of the weak curves.

ECC provides much better performance than RSA with fewer sharp edges like say, RSA can be used directly for encryption (poorly), whereas with ECC you use ECDH to perform a key exchange for use with a symmetric cipher.   I don't think you quite have that right.  The RSA long-term key (or DSA for that matter) is stored in the certificate. When you want to start a conversation, you can do one of two things: exchange the key using the long-term RSA key and also provide authenticity using that same RSA key, or exchange the key using a per-session key exchange (e.g. Diffie Hellman) and provide authenticity using the long-term RSA key. This is the difference between cipher suites that start TLS_RSA_... and TLS_DHE_RSA..., and it's where ephemerality comes from.  As a worked example:   Alice generates Diffie-Hellman parameters, signs them with her long-term RSA private key, sends them to Bob. Bob uses Alice's public key (delivered and verified via PKI, but that's another story) to verify that the sent parameters are authentic. If authentic, Bob computes the necessary steps within DH to share a secret key with Alice, signing this data with Alice's public key. Alice verifies the authenticity of the data, and now has a shared key with Bob. The Diffie-Hellman parameters are discarded, thus making it infeasible to recover the exchanged key if the long-term RSA key is compromised.   ECC is a completely different aspect, and not an algorithm by itself. ECDSA and ECDH are Elliptic Curve implementations of the DSA and Diffie-Hellman algorithms. They provide stronger security at smaller key lengths, and are more efficient, at the cost of more complex implementation.  You are right about the 2048-bit key sizes, though. As long as there are no immense leaps made in the field of semiprime factorisation, RSA at the 2048-bit level should be considered secure for at least another decade. The computational complexity class of RSA means that performance does not scale linearly, so 4096-bit keys incur a much more significant overhead in comparison to 2048-bit keys, for little tangible security benefit in most contexts."

crypto,3440mq,convivialdingo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:14:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, I already have the business plan sketched out, know it could work in an industry that already exists. The encryption would be a necessary component of operation, the lynchpin of the service's value, and the most patentable part of the product itself. It is a physical product, but would need this system in order to be useful.  The threat isn't so much the issue, from a security standpoint, but the system should be able to work to scale as much as people use a redbox machine. It should be stable enough to ensure tickets created remain valid until completion of process.   Locking mechanism will create encypted key, output printed ticket, ticket redeemed to unlock."
crypto,3440mq,convivialdingo,2,Tue Apr 28 22:35:33 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound like the cryptography part would be the novel patentable part. This sounds like just another day in the world of cryptography. Zero-knowledge proofs and stuff like it is where the cool stuff happens.   Anyway, with random strings for authentication to unlock they don't need to be encrypted, just unpredictable and sufficiently protected from spying. Look at existing session tokens as used for HTTP, for example. Using HMAC to create a token you track is equally effective, or by just generating random strings tracked by an authentication server, etc...  Digital signatures and HMAC are verifiable offline, signatures are resistant against hardware tampering to extract secret values if the private key sits on a protected server only (HMAC isn't, unless you've got tamper protected hardware, as it is a symmetric scheme). If the private key is on the device itself, they provide equal protection.   I'm pretty sure printed digital signatures are your best choice, probably using ECC for minimal size and Qr codes for encoding and quick scanning.  You generate a unique one-time string and a timestamp (and probably some more data), hash it. Then you can HMAC it and put the HMAC in the authentication database and print it in the Qr code, or you can chose to sign the hash, put the hash and signature in the authentication database, and put the hash and signature in the Qr code. On verification, you look for the value in the database, if it is there and correct then you flag it as used, then you unlock.  Edit: even that is massively overengineered, on a second thought..."

Here's what I was thinking of doing with sneaker: - Pack file holding credentials - Commit to repo - Give key access to whoever is in charge of deploying But then I thought, isn't that just moving the problem? Because now, the user has to store their AWS access key on the server. Then again, those are easier to revoke if  needed. But if an attacker gets access to them and decrypts the file anyways, the credentials stored in there would have to revoked as well. Am I missing the point of a tool like this?

The problem is that cryptography is hard and complicated, and not well understood.   What we need is good libraries to make it easy to add secure crypto (we already have pretty good ones, so this is more an awareness thing), and most importantly we need good UI to make it easy to do things the secure way.   People tend to follow the path of least resistance. As long as doing things in a secure way is more work / more complicated / more resistance, it won't be widely used. What we need is UI and logic so that the path of least resistance is the secure way.  And in that light I think we're our own enemy, insisting that security must be perfect or be worthless. Some security is better than no security. Security with some situational workarounds are better than no security and no workarounds needed at all.   People generally say ""but if people think it's secure while they're potentially not, that's bad!"" - A good point, but for the most part people generally don't care. And when they do care, I'd argue that it's again a UI thing. The UI should clearly and accurately and and in an easy-to-understand manner convey how secure the current communication is.

How breaking is formalized comes from complexity-based assumptions: Classically, we look for problems that are hard for BPP (randomized, polytime) computers to solve.  Problems such as factoring, discrete log, EC discrete log,... are believed to be hard, so they serve as a good foundation for building schemes resistant to BPP-attackers.  Unfortunately, most of these are known to be solvable by BQP computers, so a BQP (quantum) attacker could break these cryptosystems.  In order to make quantum-resistant crypto, we must start with assumptions that we believe are hard for BQP computers to solve.  Lattice problems are a hot topic of study -- for other reasons beyond their anti-quantumness -- and is one such candidate.  Furthermore, many secret-key constructions (AES, various hashes,...) are also believed to just be quantum resistant since there isn't really any better attack than a brute force (which quantum algorithms have a quadratic advantage in).  Finally, there is research into quantum crypto that require quantum machines to run.  These are quite interesting as they get new powerful assumptions, but the downside is we have no quantum computers to run them on.

OTPs long enough to be useful are difficult to transfer. If you can securely transfer the OTP, you can probably transfer the message itself in the same secure manner. Because OTPs are difficult to transfer and generate, there's a very big temptation to reuse them. If you use it even twice, you can begin recovering the messages. rand(3) is not a good random number generator. To properly make an OTP, you need a true random stream.

A while back we started thinking about what to do with the issues that the Snowden leaks revealed to the world. My friends, Linus and Leif, are two of the best people I know.

We decided to put our minds and skills together and try to make an encrypted messaging app. We thought about the issues, the things noone seemed to be trying to solve. The tech community had solutions – but only focused on the people who understood the problems. The non-tech communities didn’t care. A messenger that catered to the common users but still understood the political issues was a thing we all felt was missing. We started a crowd-funding campaign, both to see if there was an interest but also to raise enough money to actually get time to do this. We were thinking we might get about 50.000 USD in a few months. In about 48 hours we had three times that money, and we decided that we needed to stop asking for money, it was more than we knew what to do with.  So we had about 130.000 USD after all fees was paid. And then we lost some more (like 30.000USD) because of a bitcoin wallet that got stolen from our bitcoin supplier. But still, a lot of money. We decided to hire some people to help us out with the things we are not experts in. The process was slow and hit with lots of realizations of that certain things would not work. The ideas were too complex and sometimes just too expensive. We had a lot of money, but far away the same amount (we’re talking millions or billions) that our competitors had access to. Just think – verification by SMS for all of the potential users would be millions of dollars even at a few cents per SMS. And if we didn’t verify by SMS it would be hard to invite users and bootstrap the usage. It’s a lot of these things that we didn’t understand until quite far in to the process.  In the middle of it all one of our team members got a kid and had to focus on that of course. I personally had other issues as I got kidnapped by the swedish government and locked up for my work with another project – The Pirate Bay. In the middle of the kidnapping, my father died. I had no way of working on anything, and I’ve had a hard time with how I personally need to handle things. This project – as well as the other projects I’m involved in – was hit massively by my absence. And they still are, since I have not been able to get 100% on my feet yet. I’m getting there but just as with other things, it takes a lot of time.  So, we had been working on this project for a long time with all of the set backs we had. And a few weeks back we started talking. What are our results? We have spent the money (and if we paid for all the work and time that we and other people put in it would have been many times more). We have a decent app for IOS and Android. But it’s still not finished and there are other things that are not software related that’s missing and will take lots of more time. And would require much more money both for time but also for legal, hardware, structures etc.  But the bad thing – or rather good if one tries to stay positive – is that our competitors have been good at fixing issues. And we have lots of new ones. They’ve had more progress and financial support so they could speed up their process to the level that they’re now really good. Better than our messaging app could become right now. Ok, they’re missing on features but they have the ability and cash to resolve those issues. And our goal was always to ensure that the everyday users would be protected. Signal and other apps are doing that quite well, with good UI and UX compared to what was the case when we started.  We decided that we could go two ways. We could ask for more money (a lot), either from the community or some investors. Or we could close down. Since we already got money from the community with way too little to show back from the expectations that felt wrong. And we don’t think that it would be a good idea to ask investors for money since we’d lose control over the project. So in the end, closing it down felt like the least bad thing to do.  I know a lot of people will be upset. But timing is key, and there’s no point in spending more time just because we feel we dropped the ball. Life gave us curveballs and we were probably way too naive in entering this project. I don’t regret it though, but right now it’s stressing me (and the other guys) quite a bit, because we really don’t want to disappoint the community. But then again, we also wouldn’t really contribute. And we still lack funds if we decide to go ahead. So it’s a catch 22. We tried looking for someone to merge our project with, but didn’t really find anyone. And we’re not sure what to do with the things we’ve created – part of it might be useful for someone, other things (that took a lot of time to create) are things we realized would not work in larger scales.  So I’m sorry that we’re closing down, but it’s the only reasonable thing to do. Sometimes it’s better to just take the bull by the horns than to try to ignore it. And move on to the next thing and try to fix that. I’m personally trying to influence people and politicians to make sure we don’t need systems like Heml.is. We should be protected by the governments instead of trying to protect ourselves from them. It’s a multi-angle attack needed, technology, political work and transparency."

A concept not far from event occurring in many business environments today.  Now lets say I work at that group and was tasked to install FDEs for all employees, without the knowledge of management I configure all devices to decrypt with a second master key.  Using this key to gain access to other information after the devices are used.  This is a backdoor.    I think there is a pretty big difference between the two, the definition of what parties are intended to have access to the information.

That's a genuine ""Front Door"", because making FDE more secure doesn't impact its effectiveness.  You're keeping the company secure while allowing access if something goes wrong like the employee forgets their password.  If, on the other hand, you wanted to make sure that the FDE wasn't very good so that you could afford the resources to decrypt it every night, then you're in a very different situation.  That's a ""Back Door"" because it limits the goodness of the FDE that can be utilized.  Unfortunately, it might limit the FDE to one that ordinary criminals can crack easily.  That would lead to evildoers seeking to steal your company's laptops to get the tasty secrets off them.  In this case, you've made the company overall less secure.  The US seems to be suggesting a ""Back Door"" even with their key escrow schemes.  They want to decrypt all the content in transit, so they can search through it to find a good reason to investigate folks.  That can only be done, even with key escrow, if they can use all the keys all the time.  It's completely different that the good reason construct of a Front Door, where using the keys comes after suspicion rather than before.

Yes, for purposes of law enforcement there are legitimate use cases where being able to decrypt data of suspects would lead to criminals being caught that otherwise may escape justice.

First you would come up with a secret message you want to send to the other person (""The quick brown fox""), then you come up with a less than secret message that you want eavesdroppers to be able to read (""The slow green frog""), you take this second message and shift it down three letters so that it becomes the public message (""Wkh vorz juhhq iurj""). The key is calculated by figuring out the shifts required to transform the public message, into the private message. The only reason for performing the caesar shift is to provide a decoy message that may satiate the curiosity of your eavesdropper, it could easily just be a a random inconspicuous phrase."

Its not clear to me that the shifting of the public message really does anything useful. It seems like it would be equally as secure to calculate the offsets for each character in the secret message to arrive at the unshifted public message, and just share that.  There is no method other than randomly guessing to derive the secret message from the public message alone: the public message is not derived from the secret message. It doesn't even provide a mechanism to verify that a random guess is correct. You would just be comparing two unrelated english sentences to each other.  So you are right, this isn't practical at all. Without consideration of the shifted secret message being discovered, this is the same as having no public message, and just sharing the secret message privately. Or just using the predetermined shift used to encrypt the public message in your original description to shift the secret message, and share that privately."

You can recover the key k with some function f and a secret s for which key k = f(c₁, s).  This key then can be used with encryption scheme E to recover the actual message m = E-1(k, c₂).    If I understand correctly in your case your function f is a shift of all letters of s down the alphabet. This is only 26 probabilities and would be easy to bruteforce by hand.  If otherwise it is something else like shifting every single character in a secret s by different amounts, this is 26length of s possibilities. If s is English (or other natural language) it might be possible to reduce the search space. The longer the length of s the better. Similarly for xor as Natanael_L suggests."

Record the random ID in your database so you can know which login goes with which transaction -- you'll know if someone else gets their hands on the token and tries to reuse it.

I need to ""lose"" the token in the blinding process, and be left only with an unblinded signature that I can check is genuine - i.e. no message attached, just a signature (even a hash of the token is no good because I'm then able to identify the token in question by simply hashing every token I have and comparing).

Server supports various external payment methods (i.e. not directly integrated). Client selects one, makes the payment and makes a note of all payment details: method; account number or cryptocurrency address; receipt or transaction number. Server has an RSA signing key. It can be weak (1024 bits) since it's only protecting signups for the service, but we will make it the standard 2048 bits. The public key is published, with exponent e, modulus N. The private key has exponent d and modulus N. Client chooses a random string, say 256 bits, hashes it and pads it out to the server's key size according to PSS signing standard. Call the padded token m. Client chooses and stores a random r (relatively prime to N), and generates blinded message B := mre mod N. B is uniformly random mod N, regardless of m. Client submits payment details and B to the server. Staff verify payment and publish blinded signature S' = Bd mod N (= md r mod N) on the site, indexed and searchable by payment details. S' is also uniformly random mod N, and uncorrelated to m from the server's perspective. Client periodically searches payment details on server and retrieves S'. Client divides S' by r to compute the unblinded signature S = md mod N, a valid PSS signature. The client now has a valid signature on m, even though nothing the server saw was correlated with m. Client sends S and m to the server. Server checks S is a valid PSS signature on m, puts it in a database so it won't be accepted again, and returns login credentials. Even though the server now has access to m, it is a meaningless random string and uncovers no knowledge about the client or the payment. Client installs login credentials and logs in. Apart from tracking IP addresses (solved by signing up over Tor), there is no feasible way for the server to link S with S', so payment details are decoupled from login credentials."

crypto,33a88q,drb0110,2,Mon Apr 20 21:53:46 2015 UTC,"I am stuck, however, on how to leverage these linear approximations to derive the subkeys for each round.   The subkeys for SIMON are completely deterministic.  The list of probabilities mentioned cannot be used to derive subkeys directly.  In the paper referenced, use equation 1, tables two and three to derive the subkeys.   How do I go from the linear approximation to a program that finds the subkeys?   So what those probabilities are for are determining the result of F. e.g.  P[ F(X)i = X(i-2) ]    = P[F(X)i = X(i-2) | X(i-2) = 1] + P[F(X)_i = X(i-2) | X_(i-2) = 0]  P[ F(X)i = X(i-2) ^ X(i-1) ]  = P[F(X)_i = X(i-2)  ^ X(i-1)| X(i-2) = 1, X(i-1) = 1] + P[F(X)_i = X(i-2)  ^ X(i-1)| X(i-2) = 0, X(i-1) = 1] + P[F(X)_i = X(i-2)  ^ X(i-1)| X(i-2) = 1, X(i-1) = 0] + P[F(X)_i = X(i-2)  ^ X(i-1)| X(i-2) = 0, X_(i-1) = 0]  and so on.  If it helps any, use figure 2 in the paper with various inputs.    Now, how to retrieve the subkeys?  For starters,  look at equation four in the paper.  set the left hand side of the equation to just (K1)_2 by XOR'ing the other terms.  The right hand side will then have all other terms in the equation XOR'ed together.  Use the probabilities listed to, as you put it, ""linearly approximate"" (X_L1)_2  edit: forgot a word"
crypto,33br4o,uranusaurus_rekt,6,Tue Apr 21 05:51:44 2015 UTC,"Without something like Zero-knowledge proofs, which is currently very inefficient to implement, it isn't really possible. Encrypted data is supposed to be indistinguishable from random. You can make entropy density estimations, but that still doesn't tell you if the data is encrypted with a strong key, with a weak key or if it is random."
crypto,33br4o,Natanael_L,1 point,Tue Apr 21 08:56:06 2015 UTC,"Encryption hides information, but I am not sure it is completely necessary for every encrypted message to be indistinguishable from randomness. Especially in a situation where I do know something about the key, and I can possibly control something about the payload. For a general purpose cryptosystem this should not happen, but the purpose in this case is plausible deniability for me, not secrecy for my user.  Suppose there was a first round of AES, for which I have no knowledge of the key or message but (for the sake of simplicity) a second round that uses just a simple XOR cipher.  When the user requests to store something, they tell me the last half of the key they will use (for the second round), and I will respond with some keylength/2 data I know they are to insert every keylength/2 bytes. They are then to encrypt the modified first round of cyphertext, and send it to me.   Since I know something about the key and something about the message, I can (sort of) verify that the protocol was followed without knowing how to decrypt the rest of the cyphertext.  For XOR this can easily be defeated by only encrypting the interspersed segments with the last half of the key and leaving the original payload cleartext, but it suggest to me that something a little more sophisticated might be possible without computationally intensive analysis of the final ciphertext.  The mechanism used to demonstrate that I cannot trivially infer the unknown part messages does not necessarily need to be bulletproof, it just needs to impose enough of a burden to discovering the whole cleartext message to protect me from malicious users 'poisoning the well', or to render decrypting the entire database (in the case of someone gaining access to it, or me being compelled to turn it over to law enforcement) impractical."

It seems like only deterministic encryption algorithms with Zero-knowledge proofs would work as everything else would be malleable and have various channels for embedding data that can be directly extracted. Maybe not even that - you can bruteforce search 216 arbitary plaintexts to find ciphertexts with the 16 initial bits matching parts of your key, allowing you to name those files with the numbers 1-16 to make it trivial to reconstruct a 256 bit key from the ciphertexts. Then the real ciphertexts would hold the data in question.   Giving the uploader the ability to control all parts of the encryption (which is a must if you want to deny responsibility) allows for an infinite number of ways to perform shenanigans which you might not approve of.   For strong ciphers, only Zero-knowledge proofs can show that the output ciphertext is derived directly from and ONLY from an unknown key and a secret plaintext using ONLY that encryption algorithm. Even then you don't know for certain if hidden communication channels are in use.  You can in essence never prove a lack of capabilities. You can only show that somebody who don't know X can't do Y,  not anything about who for certain will and will not know X."

I have a feeling that I might have just talked myself in a circle and summarized zero-knowledge proof... I digress.  I think I understand your point about determinism, but I think this can be mitigated if I control random variables, but the user is responsible for remembering them to make decryption deterministic. So they can no longer use that space for 'shenanigans'. And they are free to use whatever cipher they want outside of this verification protocol to ensure that the cleartext that they are storing is safe from me, the host.  The importance of determinism is more information than I came to the conversation with. So if thats all I end up leaving with, then I think its still a net positive. I do not think i need cryptographically strong proof necessarily to meet my requirements. Weak proof is might be better than no proof at all.  Thanks for your patience :P"

The idea being that the user has a public key P and a corresponding private key n (P = gn). Before encryption you generate a random y, then compute the encryption key K = P · y, encrypt the payload with K and store Y = gy along with the encrypted payload in your storage. Remember to discard y and forget about it, because without knowledge of y you are no longer able to decrypt the payload. However, the user can recompute K using x because K = Y · n and use that to decrypt. (Yes this is just Diffie-Hellman, pick up a nice implementation.)  Note that there is no guarantee to the user that you will not store y, but since they are supposedly encrypting themselves before they upload, that should be no problem, right?"

The Diffie–Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.

Your password database will be ensured confidential using encryption so that only you can decrypt it.  By using strong random passwords instead of memorable ones on each and every different site, if one site gets compromised -- all your other accounts aren't. Humans are prone to reuse the same password for convenience sake. Lastpass/KeePass etc. instead encourage unique unmemorable passwords per site while requiring you only to remember the password to decrypt your password database. It is also a lot more convenient."

I am further concerned by the revelation of continued new-protocol release to Google clients, which so far has seemed to result in faster but single-company-specific optimizations being fast tracked through standards bodies (http 2.0).  SCTP is an ambitious and exciting protocol that solves many fundamental frustrations we face today. I would be much more comfortable seeing an extensive compare/contrast between SCTP & QUIC, and a rationale for a new protocol vs optimizing SCTP.

Realistically though, there's no way to enforce the inclusion of the back door keys that makes it anything but voluntary. Pandora's Box has been opened. People have access to strong encryption. You might be able to get major systems to include a back door, but anyone who wants to avoid it will be able to. Protocols like OTR already provide end-to-end encryption over clear text channels. End-to-end encryption over an end-to-end encrypted channel that has a back door would be undetectable until someone tried to use the back door."

It's short and we all know key management hygiene is king with OTP; that's the hard part. This code takes care of the easy part, but it's definitely OTP using pure /dev/urandom to generate code pages. Each page is a byte, which is sometimes considered a weakness on block storage. Used code pages are unlinked, but many platforms require more than this. Pure /dev/urandom isn't a good choice -- detecting if your source for randomness has been/is being tampered with or copied is more important than speed for OTP.

The remaining fields are used to keep track of messages and as a way of allowing for missing messages without messing up the pad file.

So, by strict adherence to the definition, the OTP cannot exist in a practical real world setting at all. While this satisfies a few, most are willing to define the one time pad as:   A random pad at least as long as the message. The pad in part or in whole is never repeated.

From the attackers standpoint it makes no difference if the PRF is /dev/urandom or any block cipher used in CTR mode: both are semantically secure but thats not the same as information theoretical security. If the attacker can figure out the initial values (IV, PRF key etc.), all future keys can be generated. OP's cipher is a vernam cipher with pre-shared keystream generated with PRF. This is pointless. By using another PRF, a sufficient IV and a pre-shared key, the same keystream could be generated on the fly.

If that happens, we will have to switch to newer and thus less-popular and less-tested systems like NTRU, lattices/codes/LWE, hash-based signatures, multivariate quadratics, etc.  Most of these systems (but not all of them) are respectably fast but have either huge messages, huge signatures or huge keys, which makes them more trouble than ECC and RSA.  Furthermore, for many of them the parameter sizes are not settled, because we don't have enough experience attacking them."

crypto,32oz30,trofnarv,2,Wed Apr 15 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"There is one thing that some people here are missing, how this person figured out how to factor large numbers. I'm assuming that OP is asking what would happen if someone figured out how to factor large numbers in polynomial time. We already know how to factor large numbers, we just can't do it in polynomial time.  If someone found out how to do it in polynomial time, the whole mathematical world would be in a frenzy. From my poor memory, it seems that integer factorization is of NP complexity. If a NP problem can be solved in polynomial time, then P=NP. In this case, not much of anything will survive the inevitable flood gates. Elliptical Curve Cryptography relies on discrete logarithms which most believe to be in the same class and integer factorization so it would essentially be broken as well. I don't know enough about lattice crypt to say how it would be effected. Please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this, its been a few years since college.  The other possibility is if the integer factorization problem is solved using quantum computers. If quantum computers powerful enough to break RSA were invented, ECDHE would be equally at risk as efficient algorithms already exist to break that with quantum computers.  AFAIK lattice cryptography is not affected by quantum computers. I also just read about Supersingular Isogeny Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange as a post-quantum form of elliptical curve solution that is quantum resistant. I'm really excited to read more about it now. The McEliece cryptosystem is one of my favorites (because its insane), and many think that it too would be resistant to quantum computers.  The problem with those solutions are that there is not a lot of support for those kinds of encryption yet. If we found out tomorrow that all of our RSA, ECDHE, etc were vulnerable to attack, it would be quite a while before a new standard could be implemented everywhere. On top of that, any time a new software like that is pushed out in a hurry, it inevitably has a lot of bugs in it. The world wouldn't necessarily fall apart, but it would be in a lot of turmoil for some time."

It's not that the new hash functions aren't any good, it's that we don't really need one. When we started this process back in 2006, it looked as if we would be needing a new hash function soon. The SHA family (which is really part of the MD4 and MD5 family), was under increasing pressure from new types of cryptanalysis. We didn't know how long the various SHA-2 variants would remain secure. But it's 2012, and SHA-512 is still looking good.  Even worse, none of the SHA-3 candidates is significantly better. Some are faster, but not orders of magnitude faster. Some are smaller in hardware, but not orders of magnitude smaller. When SHA-3 is announced, I'm going to recommend that, unless the improvements are critical to their application, people stick with the tried and true SHA-512. At least for a while.   I don't want to switch everything over to the new thing simply because it's new and cool. I'd rather stay on SHA2 until there is a reason to change."

The ""tried and true"" SHA-512 does have weaknesses:   length-extension attack (a real problem which is why we have things like HMAC). Joux' multicollision attack (more of a theoretical concern, as far as I can tell).   These are generic attacks on the Merkle–Damgård construction. The recent generic attack by Joux shows this construction is a worse approximation of the random oracle model than previously assumed. For sponge functions (like SHA-3 variants) we have a mathematical proof that these sort of generic attacks are not possible. That's pretty cool."

Most software that require serious security won't include anything that isn't yet proven to work as expected. It takes time.  Edit: also, as said by /u/_zenith, it isn't finalized yet. That means nobody interested in any kind of compatibility will use it in live deployments, because even the slightest change in the final standard can break compatibility.   And even once finalized, then the top paragraph still remains true. A very few will experiment it, and everybody else who are interested will watch the results closely.   Most people are actually fine with using SHA2 today. SHA3 was started because cracks were showing in SHA1 and SHA2 shares much of the design, and thus it was assumed SHA2 might fall too. But the recent cryptanalysis shows that it remains strong. So today there's no urge to switch."

SHA is a little slow and harder to implement cheaply in hardware. For a given number of bits of security, Keccak performs significantly faster and is easier to implement in hardware. If I have two designs to choose from that both give the same level of security, but one needs fewer gates or cycles, then by all means I'm going to pick that one. Given how many exabytes of SSL'd data goes around the world every month, it's no surprise that a faster hash algorithm is important."

If you need a power-analysis-resistant hash function (eg for HMAC), SHA3 is the way to go.  ARX systems (including SHA2 as well as Blake, Blake2 and Salsa20/ChaCha) are a nightmare to blind against DPA.  Also, the SHA3 family is extremely fast in hardware if you devote a lot of area to it.  It's like 3x better than SHA2, 4x better than Blake, and I'd guess quite a bit faster than Blake2 as well.  Finally, sponge functions provide pretty good options for a single symmetric primitive supporting hashing, encryption and MAC, or even metaprotocols like BLINKER.

crypto,32m07b,floodyberry,2,Wed Apr 15 12:19:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert on hardware implementation, but I do know a little something about it.   Addition requires carry propagation, so the input of the first bit is linked to the output of the last bit, which means that the propagation delay is higher. Simple XOR or AND has no such construction - the path from input to output is shorter and completely parallel with respect to each bit. Which means lower propagation delay, which means shorter hold times in hardware and faster cycle times.  Fast carry propagation is a heavily studied topic, and CPU engineers often employ techniques to speed it up. One such design is the Kogge-Stone Adder, which is one of the fastest, if not the fastest designs. However, it is still not a stupid simple as an XOR or AND gate, so it still has a higher propagation delay.  In software, this design choice of Keccak balances out less, because AND, OR, XOR, ADD, SUB all take about the same time per instruction. The reason for this has to do with the design of a CPU - one, there's a lot of overhead in processing an instruction, regardless of what it is, and two, instructions all have to fit into the same discrete chunks of the pipeline in the CPU. If during the 'execute' stage of the pipeline, one instruction needs 100 picoseconds and one needs 500 picoseconds to run, that stage of the pipeline is probably going to be designed to just wait 500 picoseconds. There are instructions that are longer, like multiple or divide, and they'll be executed like they were just looping over that same 500 picosecond stage."

X - Y becomes X + (~Y + 1)."
crypto,32m07b,antiduh,2,Sun Apr 19 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"Addition does take more gates than XOR, but that's not the problem.  (It is a lot of why Keccak has such a great hardware speed/area tradeoff though.)  Hardware implementations for systems like smart cards often randomize their state if they're handling something like a secret key, in order to make power analysis harder.  For something like RSA or ECC there are lots of options: you can randomize the z-coordinate, or multiply by a factor and cancel it at the end, or work mod random*p instead of mod p, or add a multiple of the group order to the scalar/exponent, or whatever.  Interestingly, you don't use the software trick of constant-time table lookups with a linear scan and masking, because usually SRAM lookups are constant-time and they leak less than the linear scan.  For symmetric ciphers, some implementations will actually split the state of the system into shares, so that eg S1 xor S2 xor S3 is the state.  This makes XOR gates cheap, because the masks can simply propagate (maybe with a remask step).  But AND gates are expensive, because you need to combine the masks without leaking anything.  This means that long chains of AND gates are very slow and expensive to mask; in particular, carry propagation is very painful.  For something like SHA2, this can be mitigated a little by using carry-save addition, where the final sum isn't computed until it's needed.  But Blake2 alternates directly between XOR and ADD, which means carry-save doesn't help.  Obviously a hash function doesn't always handle secret state, and being better in one scenario doesn't make Keccak better overall.  Also Keccak is pretty big -- 1600 bits of state, and fastest when it's all in flops+logic -- and that causes many people to use SHA2 if they don't need masking.  But in certain hardware applications it's very good."

Surely the fastest hash in dedicated hardware will be faster than another hash running in software on general-purpose hardware?

What has happened since the last time NIST had a conference on SHA-3 is as follows:  1) Department of Commerce has not signed off on the SHA-3 standard FIPS-202.  The reason?  The Department of Commerce is slower than molasses on signing off anything.  2) Many of the cryptographers that have participated in SHA-3 competition have since shifted their focus on getting their algorithms into other standards orgs, namely the IETF and the working groups under it (e.g. IRTF).  To name a couple, some of the folks that created blake and DJB.  In some sense, I see these efforts as shooting SHA-3 to irrelevancy and as an attempt by the cryptographers to make a name for themselves.    3) There is a lot of mistrust with NIST.  By law they have to work with the NSA on publishing cryptographic standards.  NIST has tried twice since 2013 to re-establish this trust with the public at large by establishing policies and practices to provide a more viewable process of how their standards are developed.  They've asked the public.  They ask in their conferences the hold.  They've published some NISTIR which attempt to define an open standards development policy but I think they are not in genuine faith because the IR's do not go into enough scope about their relationship with the NSA.  To formally answer your question, it has a lot less to do with the controversy and a lot more to do with (1).  In light of the mathematical perspective of sponge functions and the size of capacity makes the controversy a difference of those that understand why it is perfectly okay to do so and those that don't understand mathematically why is perfectly okay to do so.  Keep in mind many of the names mentioned in the ""NIST Controversy"" link were also competitors of the SHA-3 competition.

crypto,32m07b,floodyberry,6,Wed Apr 15 10:09:34 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add a link to an article by the Keccak team which they wrote in response to some mischaracterizations of what happened. This is not to say that Barreto is misrepresenting anything.  My personal comments follow…  What happened is that we used to define security solely based on a hash function's output length. And with the new Sponge construction, we learned that for Sponge-based hash functions it's actually a better idea to separate the security level s from the output length n for an optimal security/speed trade-off, see Tune Keccak. The problem is that people still like to use a single number – the output length – to select a hash. So, given a sponge function where you can also choose what capacity to use, you have to somehow map the output length n to a security level s and use c=2s as capacity parameter. Here are two options:    s = n  s = n/2   Option 1 is what we have now: full preimage resistance for all SHA-3 variants including SHA-3-512 even though nobody needs a preimage resistance of 512, not even if the attacker as a quantum computer to spare. The upside: SHA-3 sticks to everybody's expectations. The downside: It's slower than option 2.  Option 2 is what NIST was considering: one consistent security level for all kinds of attacks. This means, finding preimages would be as difficult as finding collisions. The upside: It's faster than option 1. The downside: It's against people's expectations for a hash function with an output of n bits to only provide a preimage resistance of n/2.  Option 2 is motivated by the idea that we generally care about collision resistance. No hash function that gives you a string of n bits can do better than n/2 w.r.t. collision resistance. That's the reason we have 512 bit hash functions. It's not because we want a preimage resistance of 512 but because we may want a collision resistance of 256. A resistance of 512 against anything is meaningless. It's not ""better"" than 256 for all intents and purposes. The only objection to option 2 I have is that SHA-3-256 would have given us only a preimage resistance of 128 which is lower than 256 while 256 is actually a reasonable security level target in the light of quantum computers.  I'm happy with the result of the SHA-3 competition. Once the standard is finalized, we'll have fixed-length output hash functions ""SHA-3-n"" for n in {224,256,384,512} with preimage and collisions resistances everybody expects so that they can be used as drop-in replacement for SHA2. Also, we'll get variable-length output hash functions ""SHAKE-s"" where s is an upper bound for the security level. With the SHAKE variants we have all the control we want. Pick a security level s out of {128,256} and pick an appropriate output length n for your application. The preimage resistance will be min(s,n) and the collision resistance will be min(s,n/2). For example, if you want preimage and collision reistance to be at least 256, use 512 bits of output of SHAKE-256. This will be 89% faster than SHA-3-512."

The difference between Second Preimage Resistance and Preimage Resistance is what you're given and the problem. Preimage Resistance is trying to fine just one element in the preimage set {z | H(z) = y}.  Second PreImage Resistance starts with one preimage element in {z | H(z) = y} and tries to find another preimage element, x', in the set {z | H(z)=y}.  The issue is that second pre-image resistance and pre-image resistance are different.  Cramer-Shoup just requires a second pre-image resistant hash function.  When Paulo states:   However, there are protocols that require only preimage-resistant hash functions...   and continues to use Cramer Shoup as an example, then his argument is in question because Cramer-Shoup requires a second preimage resistant hash function instead of a preimage resistant hash function.    The other tall-tale sign that I see problematic with his argument is his next example of Shao-Schnorr.  At this point in time I don't have any literature handy on Shao-Schnorr so I can't really comment on it, however when using just Schnorr, when assuming the e=h(x,m) step provides sufficient preimage resistance, it is actually advantageous to use an altered Keccak.  If Shao-Schnorr is anything like Schnorr,  then I would have to further question Paulo's argument.  During the controversy, we tried and tried again to come up with examples where the altered keccak would be problematic.  Each time an example came up, someone else was able to quickly counter the example to explain why it was still okay.    I would also like to add that while the NIST required a hash function that was a drop in replacement for SHA-2 when the competition began.  At the beginning of the competition all publicly known cryptographically secure hash functions of an output length of size n had a preimage resistance of n, a collision resistance of n/2, and while we're on the topic, a second preimage resistance of n.  What was demonstrated with the altered keccak the security strength of preimage resistance and collision resistance could be the same, a fairly novel concept at the time and something that had not been considered at the formulation of the competition and almost surely was never considered before because there was no prior art or demonstration of such a hash function."

A possibly-contentious question about your design: let's say you allow the client to pull a (symmetrically encrypted) keyfile from the server, decrypt it with the locally-generated key (the bottom end of your PBKDF result), and use it as the file key. GnuPG and others do this: it allows the password to be changed painlessly (without having to touch the encrypted storage); file key(s) can be arbitrary lengths; metadata, such as expiration dates, can be embedded. Maybe compromised passwords aren't a big deal. But, as the system administrator, do you implement a shred function for (symmetrically encrypted) keyfiles in the event that the password is changed?"

crypto,32in0d,spap-oop,3,Tue Apr 14 07:15:09 2015 UTC,"Consider how you will perform authentication changes. If a user changes his password, what happens?  Separate the authentication from the encryption key. If you need to have all data on the server, then have the server store a keyblob on behalf of the client. The server does not create the keyblob. The blob would contain a random salt, the key and a hash of the key, wrapped using a KEK derived from the user's password with the random salt. The server should not have a hand in defining the salt value. Be sure to verify the hash before trusting the key.  Updating the authenticator requires an update to the wrapped keyblob.   The server side authentication needs some thought into how to authenticate without revealing any of the key. Depends on how paranoid you want to be. But I'm off to work, I'll think about it."

This prevents others from claiming authorship as you can prove authorship through proving the keypair is derived from your main keypair. With your scheme, signatures only prove that you ""approve of the message"".  (Yes, I'm assuming the original message will be distributed with the original signature intact, while later signatures of the public key might be generated by anybody.

crypto,32gh1v,Natanael_L,3,Mon Apr 13 23:30:16 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of something like Bitcoin stealth addresses type math.   Edit: See my post here: http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/2015-April/007194.html http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2015-April/025345.html  You have one main ECC public key that is shared.  When signing, you derive a new keypair by this method; calculate an HMAC of the message with your main keypair's private key as the HMAC key to generate a secret value which you and only you can derive at any point in time, and that you can share without leaking any secrets. Use that HMAC output value to perform EC multiply on your public key and your private key, this derives a new complete ECC keypair.  Share the derived public key with the message, sign with the derived private key. This can't be tied to you at this stage.   When proving it was you, you publish the HMAC value (which you can recalculate at that point in time, no need to store any state). It can't be calculated by others knowing only the public keys, it can't be forged either, and nobody else can create a public key from it which they are capable of deriving the correct private key for. This allows people to confirm that the derived signing keypair indeed is derived from your main keypair, as EC multiply with the main public key and the HMAC value gives the signing public key. And because the signature is valid, they know it is yours.   Every message you sign gets a unique keypair. Every message is individually deanonymized when you wish to reveal you signed them.   If you wish to tie together multiple signed messages to what's effectively one pseudonym before revealing yourself, also without having to instantly reveal that they belong to the same pseudonym at the time of publishing, you could do it through a ""hierarchical"" scheme;  Use the main keypair to derive a pseudonym specific main keypair with the HMAC method using any pseudonym specific string you wish as the HMAC key (this is your only stored state). Use that pseudonym specific derived keypair as described above, as if it was the main keypair.   You reveal the messages as belonging to the pseudonym keypair by revealing the message specific HMAC values. You reveal the tie to your main keypair by revealing the pseudonym specific HMAC value.   /u/DoWhile,  /u/bitwiseshiftleft,  feedback?"
crypto,32gh1v,bitwiseshiftleft,3,Mon Apr 13 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a very good solution.  You're effectively proving that two keys gx and gy belong to the same person by revealing x/y.  You can do this to show that two pseudonymous signatures are linked without linking them to your main identity, since you know x and y for the pseudonyms.  You don't need a hierarchical setup for this."

If I know those values for both messages, I can prove the messages are from the same person without revealing anything that ties it to the main keypair? I literally just publish HMAC_1/HMAC_2?  Aren't there any problems with this if you later on have to tie together many additional messages, information leakage?  Edit: g = generator point, x and y is the private keys, the points calculated from gx and gy are the public keys? Think that's the case. Am I right in assuming gx + (x/y) = gy?  So then you only reveal the HMAC value specifically when revealing the tie to the main keypair?  Edit: math corrections"

If I know those values for both messages, I can prove the messages are from the same person without revealing anything that ties it to the main keypair? I literally just publish HMAC_1/HMAC_2?   Right.  The division would be modulo the order of the group g.   Aren't there any problems with this if you later on have to tie together many additional messages, information leakage?   Well, there is the obvious one: if you link A to B, and B to C, then you've also linked A to C.  I think also you'll have to be careful with deterministic signatures.  So if for example you derive the signature nonce as HMAC(secret key, ""derive me a nonce"" || message), then you could run into trouble by signing the same message with two identities that ultimately share the same secret key.  If you avoid this problem (by adding the per-identity key to that HMAC invocation, for example) then I think everything is fine."
crypto,32gh1v,Natanael_L,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:07:39 2015 UTC,"See my edit above as well.  So if x is the main private key, and m_i is the message, then you get H_i = HMAC(m_i, x).  Then you do EC_multiply(x, H_i) = x_i and EC_multiply(gx, H_i) = gx_i as the derived keypair. Edit: x * H_i = x_i, gx + H_i = gx_i.   You reveal x_i/x_j for the pairs of messages you link. It is the same as the HMAC value H_i when linking to the main keypair, gx.   Trying to straighten out my own confusion about the math here...  Your last advice is good, I've seen it described before as ""be explicit about the purpose of the operations"". So any mismatch in assumptions doesn't break it automatically, because the different uses will be using different values."
crypto,32gh1v,bitwiseshiftleft,2,Mon Apr 13 22:24:05 2015 UTC,"Right. Alternatively, you don't need to base your pseudonymous keys on your main one.  They can just be gxi and then to link to the main one you publish x/xi."

And because the signature is valid, they know it is yours.    Overall the solution seems reasonable, but I'm skeptical about this exact claim, depending on the details.  This is one level of abstraction deeper than I'm used to, so bear with me.  A message is signed and can be verified under some derived public key DPK=PK*HMAC(message).  However, this is one equation and two unknowns: PK is unknown since the original author is hidden, and HMAC(message) is also not published. A malicious entity with their own public key, say MPK, and claim the HMAC was DPK*(MPK)-1 (where the inversion is done in the EC group).  Of course, the bogus HMAC doesn't come from anything, but nobody can actually verify that since HMACs are computed in secret.  If you also required that the derived secret signing key is used to sign, say, your main public key, then that I think avoids this issue, and you don't even need to publish the HMAC, but then I'm worried about signing things you derived from things itself... This sorta turns into rouslek's solution, modeling the HMAC as a PRF with some possibly-more-efficient-but-maybe-less-secure key derivation."
crypto,32gh1v,Natanael_L,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:49:09 2015 UTC,"If somebody claims another HMAC value and thus another public key, they can't succeed in a challenge response protocol (I think). Edit: how does inversion work? IIRC it shouldn't be possible to derive any value that allows you to compute x_i/x_j for any two keypairs unless you know the private keys for both those keypairs. Wouldn't that inversion, gx_i * ( gx_a )-1 reveal x_i/x_a-1 (a = adversary), allowing them to also compute x_i = x_a-1 * ( x_i/x_a-1 )?  Or can't they compute that corresponding inversion on their private key? Because if so my security assumptions still stand, just require a challenge response protocol.   HMAC already have a pretty strong security model. I'm not worried that will have some weird side effect together with ECC.  Edit: I think you're best off signing x_i/x_j with both keys, as this proves you're in control of both keypairs simultaneously. This way you show you're you (have control over your old established keypair) and the original signer (controls the signing keypair).   Showing one it's derived from the other would require that you can prove something about the value x_i/x_j that shows it isn't simply random, but that they're related. A Zero-knowledge proof of the HMAC input would work (zk-SNARK?), as it shows x_i/x_j = HMAC(x_i, m) without revealing any secrets, for the statement ""gx_j was derived from gx_i based on message m and the private key of gx_i"". Then you show the relationship is non-random, but related in a way that couldn't be predicted in advance or forged.  Edit 2: what if you don't use H_i = HMAC(x_m, m) to derive the new keypair, but as a seed for a new H_di = HMAC(H_i, m), so that you then do gx_m + H_di = gx_i and x_m * H_di = x_i to get the new keypair (d means derivation, m means main keypair)?  Then you can publish the first HMAC value to allow others to verify that it is indeed a number derived from the message used to derive the keypair by themselves computing gx_m + HMAC(H_i, m) = gx_i?

No, that's the point... anyone can invert in a group even if you can't take discrete logs.  Given P=gx and Q=gy without being given x,y, I can always compute P/Q = gx-y without knowledge of x or y or x-y.  Of course, without knowledge of this, they would immediately fail any challenge/response for the private key as you noted!  Rather than any complex fix, you can just prove ownership by cross signing the main and derived keypairs.  Proving knowledge of secret key is (I believe) a much stronger requirement than necessary, though there are extractable zk style signatures where a signature doubles as a proof of knowledge of secret key, but I think that's not even necessary.     Edit: I think you're best off signing x_i/x_j with both keys, as this proves you're in control of both keypairs simultaneously.

That method is supposed to be used as a kind of commitment to the message to prove the message was known before the keypair was created. Thus you can show you weren't just simply given the private key of the signer later on, but that you really did have the message before signing and publishing. And it remains stateless, so you can recalculate the values later without needing to store any additional data.  Edit: it specifically shows there's a non-arbitary unforgable relationship between the public keys which is related to the message (due to the usage of the hash function)."

Of course it's possible to build an RNG that's both secure and fast, but now you've made doing so a requirement for every implementation of the protocol.

crypto,3286l6,grymoire,2,Sat Apr 11 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"There are differences other than GPG being OpenSource and PGP not. The two programs are not fully compatible with each other (I'll explain this in a moment). GPG implements the OpenPGP standard. PGP (2.x, the ""original"" one released in source by Phil Zimmermann, not the latest incarnations by McAfee and Symantec) does not (it didn't exist at the time). PGP implements the RFC1992 ""standard"". GPG has only a partial implementation of that (and the newest version of it has none).  Here is how the compatibility issue stands:  If you are using the latest version of GPG (2.1.*), forget about communicating with a PGP 2.x user. You cannot. PGP 2.x is no longer supported. The stated reason is that PGP 2.x uses MD5 as a hash function and this algorithm is nowadays considered broken (it's easy to find collisions in real-time).  If you are using the earlier versions of GPG (1.* and 2.0.*), you can communicate, to a certain degree, with a PGP 2.x user - but not fully. In particular:   Anything that PGP 2.x can produce, GPG can handle. GPG can encrypt, detach-sign and clearsign in a way that PGP 2.x can understand. GPG can sign-and-encrypt in a way that PGP 2.x can understand, but it requires 5 separate commands (I kid you not), of which 4 are GPG invocations and 1 is a file copying (concatenation) command. And, no, you can't pipe them in a single line. GPG cannot sign (without encrypting) a binary file in a way that PGP 2.x can understand. It is simply not freaking possible. This is due to a bug - GPG outputs the packets in the wrong order (consistent with the OpenPGP standard, but not with the RFC1992 standard used by PGP 2.x, yes, even if the --rfc1992 option of GPG is used). The developers decided that it was not worth fixing the bug because support for PGP 2.x was about to be dropped entirely anyway."

Key generation, signing and verification have different speeds."
crypto,327ubg,PdoesnotequalNP,2,Sat Apr 11 11:19:59 2015 UTC,"DSA requires a good source of randomness not only for key generation but also during the creation of signatures. Creating DSA signatures involves picking a random number and you must not ever pick the same number for the same key twice. Also, DSA used to be restricted to 1024 bit keys. I think that's why GnuPG switched from DSA to RSA as default for the main key. The only advantage of DSA is that signatures are more compact. But that's not important to you, apparently … in which case I would stick to RSA.  As for ElGamal versus RSA: An encrypted ElGamal message is simply about twice the size of an encrypted RSA message for the same security level. The reason why GnuPG used to defaul to ElGamal was probably related to patents. Now, RSA patents have expired. Nowadays, RSA is more convenient but not necessarily safer than ElGamal. Stick to RSA.  Summary: The current GnuPG defaults (RSA+RSA) are good w.r.t. security."

I've been using it for a while and there was a point where it accidentally blocked every google website, even if it wasn't tracking you, and a fresh install wasn't blocking anything until it the addon was disable/re-enabled.  The team working on it is very receptive to bug reports on their Github page (https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox), though, and works quickly to fix any issues.

If that's the case neither the 200 messages nor the 201st message are a one-time pad since the 201st message (which is used as the key) is used 200 times, not one-time.  If this is what you actually wanted to describe then the answer to 1) is: Alice used XOR (or whatever alice and bob agreed to use) on all of the news articles and the meaningful message resulting in the 201st message. Even if I guessed the scenario correctly I don't know what the answer to 2) should be, since it's unknown what the attacker has got. If the attacker has got all communication between alice and bob he/she can obviously do the same thing as bob did to decipher the message. If he has got every message but the last, he can take a bunch of new york times articles and xor them with each of the messages, and for each result take another message and xor it with the result.

In this way Bob can pick one of the 199 ""wrong"" OTPs and offer it to his Mom as evidence Alice is sending him articles from the NYT.

crypto,31q35l,go-ive,10,Tue Apr 7 07:16:53 2015 UTC,"Depends on how they're used.  Private key operations are done with CRT which is modulo the primes not the composite.  So you're computing     m1 = m^dP mod P   and    m2 = m^dQ mod Q   Where dP and dQ are d mod P-1 and d mod Q-1 respectively.  If you swap P/Q then you're computing mdP mod Q (and resp. mod P).  The rest of the CRT fixup computes    m3 = (m1 - m2) * (1/q mod p)  m = q * m3 + m2   Typically 1/q mod p is precomputed so (1/q mod p) * p == 0 (mod p).  So m == m2 (mod p).  So I ask you to decrypt 0 (m2 == 0) which means the output m is a multiple of p that isn't N.  So the gcd(N, ((1/q mod p)*p)) == p."
crypto,31q35l,untitleddocument37,1 point,Tue Apr 7 11:34:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed explanation. I understand the formula (I think), but I have trouble wrapping my head around how this helps in finding the private key. Could you explain how the fact that gcd(N, ((1/q mod p)*p)) == p aids here?"
crypto,31q35l,untitleddocument37,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:42:47 2015 UTC,My logic was actually a bit flawed.  since m=0 would lead to m3 being zero as well.    At issue though is that q*m3 is not going to be (m1-m2) (mod p) if you swap q for p.  So you end up with m == p/q * (m1-m2) + m2 == m2 (mod p) which is a fancy way of saying m - m2 divides N (it's a multiple of p).  You're given m but not m2... but what if we do the same computation twice but swap p/q once.... then you end up with    t1 = (m1-m2) + m2 == m1 (mod p)  t2  = m2 (mod p) [after the swap]   Not sure what to do next but definitely having these sorts of relations will make some sort of gcd() computation pop out.

They could have just used 4096-bit RSA but then generating a key would take 7 hours and performing a private key operation 5+ minutes.

I know OpenVPN client offers a --float (floating IPs) to support support IP roaming although there's been some crypto issues regarding the resumption aspect.

crypto,31b0c8,Sekenre,7,Fri Apr 3 13:08:48 2015 UTC,"Giving rewards for verification perverts the system and adds incentive to game the system, but verifying binaries isn't the same as mining bitcoin. All a miner needs to do is show proof of work for the work to be accepted, we don't care who the miner is, as long as the work was done, so the miner's actual identity is low value here.  Verification is different. The signing of binaries isn't merely a bitcoin-esque proof-of-work where all you care about is yes or no, but who signed the binaries matters a lot, because they have their own incentive - the verification itself, and not your external reward.  Verifying a crypto library is important to anyone that doesn't want to get hacked, so everyone would do their own verification because they want to verify themselves, not because of an external reward.  This makes the reputation system work. I trust Alice, but Bob doesn't, so Bob does his own verification. Alice and Bob need to agree on the signature, reinforcing the reputation system. Bob hates Alice, so has incentive to prove that Alice is cheating, so they're both actually going to do the work. Additionally, I trust Alice, so I ignore the 3000 'bad' verifications that come from a Sybil attack if Alice hasn't signed off.  The difficulty of a Sybil attacks is proportional to how hard it is to create identities, so make it hard to create trusted identities.  Another defense would be for the signature to also include temporary build objects that aren't distributed as part of the final binaries, so a cheater can't just take the end binaries and sign them themselves, but force them to recreate part of the build that gets incorporated into the signature. That way, 1-stage binary-only signature verification can be done by everyone, but the other builders can be used in a 2-stage binary + build object in-depth verification that makes it harder to cheat by just taking the binaries and signing them."
crypto,31b0c8,fragmede,2,Fri Apr 3 18:01:38 2015 UTC,Your last paragraph sounds like it would be ideal with the build system I am thinking of.  I'll have to think about how it could be cheated.
crypto,31b0c8,fragmede,2,Fri Apr 3 18:55:01 2015 UTC,"The later in the compile sequence the build object is picked up, the more of it ends up in the binary, and a tool could be written to take the pieces out of the final binary and reconstruct the temporary build object which may be cheaper, computationally, than actually compiling the object.  Conversely, the earlier in the compile sequence, the easier it is to generate, with no guarantee that you did any of the later steps. A resilient system would have to incorporate build products from both ends of the compile sequence.  Unfortunately this falls apart if Verifier1 and the cheating Verifiers are colluding. Which, if Verifier1 is strongly motivated to do evil, may happen. In that case, Verifier1 can simply give the temporary build objects to the later verifiers, since they lend credence to the validity of Verifier1.  In order to counteract that, we're back to Sybil attack mitigations to make it harder for Verifier1."

crypto,315mes,pred,2,Thu Apr 2 18:06:13 2015 UTC,"The problem if trust isn't just the Certificate authorities, because PKIX (x509 Public Key Infrastructure) requires more than that.  You are the user (or so you say), you give your trust to the browser that you install.  The browser preloads a list of certificates, the certificate trust list (CTL) that contains the public keys of root certificates held by certificate authorities.  The CTL lists vary in size, Mozilla is a little over 150, Apple is 220, and Microsoft was as high as 417 in January (they purged 68 in February expired/retired, the MS list is now 349, of which 306 can validate servers).  CAs don't actually issue certificates with their root certs, they keep them in a vault.  They instead create intermediate certificate authorities (ICA) that are actually used to sign end-entity certificates that are used to authenticate web servers.  ICAs are good for keeping the roots offline, but they provide the CA a way to delegate (read: sell) their authority to other organizations.  This is where the CNNIC/MCS Holding went wrong.  CNNIC issued a ""test"" two week ICA.  MCS should have installed it on an HSM used for issuing certs.  Instead their technician installed it on a ""FIPS compliant"" firewall, meaning an ssl inspection proxy.  The fact that the ssl inspection proxy was ""FIPS Compliant"" is irrelevant, installing your ICA on a firewall/proxy is a violation of the Baseline Requirements.  The rules that apply here are the cabforum.org's Baseline Requirements, sections on ""subordinate CA""."

These proxies work by effectively doing a MitM attack on the traffic. This is normally done on a corporate LAN (and according to Google it was in this case), but by using the falsely issued www.gmail.com certificate, the proxy that was redirecting traffic does not issue a certificate warning (because the chain of trust isn't broken). If this were deployed publicly that means anyone whose traffic passed through that proxy would likely be completely unaware the traffic was intercepted.   This might actually have been an innocent mistake by local engineers in Egypt that did not realize this was improper practice and simply didn't want their users to get a browser error. It's also possible that this company was contracted by someone (likely the national government in Egypt) to issue this cert and deploy this proxy so Gmail traffic in Egypt could be silently intercepted for espionage purposes.   For various technical reasons, it's not enough for Google that CNNIC issued a revocation for the certificate, and even the intermediate CA, to resolve the problem. They are revoking CNNIC's CA root cert, distrusting ALL of the certificates CNNIC has issued. They want CNNIC to create a new root certificate, which means re-issuing all certificates for all web sites in China (the .cn domain). It is likely other vendors will follow Google's move. CNNIC obviously does not want to do this as it means a lot of work for CNNIC and Chinese web engineers.   CNNIC has disputed Google's version of events, but it doesn't really matter. It's Google's decision alone as to what root CAs they choose to trust and at the moment they don't consider CNNIC trustworthy.   TL; DR China issued a bad cert that could be used for espionage, so Google stopped trusting their CA. China will have to re-issue all certs."

What you want to do is revoke the certificate before it can ever be used. In order to do that you need to get ahold of the certificate and place it in your Untrusted Certificates list.  The easiest way to do that is to browse to https://www.cnnic.cn and then view the certificate:  http://i.imgur.com/ObJ2EDo.png  You can then see the details of the certificate:  http://i.imgur.com/nA11LP7.png  The very act of looking at this certificate will cause Windows to go download it from their servers and place it in your Trusted Roots list. What you want to do is drag the certificate to your Untrusted Certificates list:  http://i.imgur.com/JOyMvh2.png  If at any time you find yourself trusting China again, you can remove the certificate from you untrusted list:  http://i.imgur.com/nVEJtqz.png  Bonus Chatter  I am sure they made an honest mistake. Many companies support lawful intercept. For example Microsoft makes a firewall for corporations, universities, high schools, and hospitals, to intercept traffic of their employees, students, and staff by perform MitM on your employees.  But two things:   You only attack computers you control, by pushing the fake trusted certificate onto your domain PCs. CNNIC India made the mistake of using a trusted certificate. You never use a trusted certificate for intercept. If you do: you're banned monitoring of employees, or high school students, is immoral. If i catch you doing it: you're banned   CNNIC is banned. I hope you learned something. Don't do it again."

So if you're using AES 256, you're using a 256 bit key. Let's not confuse the block length with key length here. For AES, your block length is always going to be 128 bits/16 bytes regardless of the key length used, so for the purposes of this discussion, the key length is a red herring.  For CTR mode, your IV should be a cryptographic nonce concatenated with some sort of counter value. The cryptographic nonce should be a random value that you've never used before, and the counter can simply start at 0. The counter should be an appropriate data type to hold an unsigned integer that will be at least as big as the number of blocks you're going to be encrypting. So, for example, if you make the first 96 bits of your IV a random value, and the next 32 bits an unsigned integer, that means you can encrypt ~4.3 billion blocks, or 68 gigabytes.  So, essentially, what you're going to do to generate your IV is generate 12 random bytes, and then four zeros, and concatenate them together, so your IV might look like:  14 F6 37 43 94 5C B2 95 DC 2D 9A BC 00 00 00 00   And then, on each iteration of your crypto loop, treat those zeros as an unsigned 32 bit int and increment by one.

In real-world systems, I've seen AES-CTR  implemented correctly once, but then more than a few times destroying complete security systems. (For example, some of the initial PlayStation 3 breakage was caused by re-using AES-CTR nonces for some certain binaries where they though it wouldn't matter. Turned out, it did matter.)  Don't dare to use AES-CTR in a custom way. That involves doing anything crazy with the IV other than straight what was already explained here. Please also read http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2013/07/22/applied-practical-cryptography/ - which is very well written. It has a few sentences about AES-CTR. The bottom line is that AES-CBC fails relatively safe(*) if used incorrectly - at least most of the time. AES-CTR fails catastrophically instantly if used incorrectly.  For a cryptographer, that difference doesn't matter a lot - if used incorrectly, both applications could be broken. But for a hacker (or security designer), it matters a lot if the system gets actually broken or theoretically broken. Don't get me wrong - both applications would need to be fixed.

Don't worry :) This is just a research topic and will yield a PoC at most. However, if there is a better block cipher mode for this scenario, I'd be happy to re-target my research.

So even if somebody was listening to every single packet, even trying to sniff on Wi-Fi Direct or Multipeer, the data that they would get would be meaningless because it would be encrypted with the optically exchanged keys,” says Newbold.   The one time pad is exchanged after being encrypted with AES.  There is no reason to bother with one time pads here as they are significantly less secure then other methods because if somebody was to be able to intercept the key in the qr code or the one time pad then future encryption would be compromised until you met in person again.  What they are doing is generating random data, encrypting it and sending it to you, you xor your data with it and send it back.  All they have done is shifted the part encrypted with old fashion encryption to be the sending of the pad, not the message, they still have to send that part encrypted.   To use current crypto primitives to do this would be something like   on install the app generates a public/private key pair. you scan my qr code, it has my public key and a random number, signed by my private key. you send me (over wi fi) a message with your public key and the random number signed by your private key.

To start a chat I generate a diffie-hellman key pair and send you the public one signed with my private key You receive it, verify it's actually from me and then generate your own diffie-hellman key pair and send me the public one signed with your private key. we both use the diffie-hellman algorithm to come up with a shared secret that we both know but nobody else that was ease dropping would know.

After the session is over or after a certain amount of time we delete the session keys and have to recreate them next time.   so this is ~how things like ssl and otr work but simplified and made to work with a qr code, unlike the linked to one   an ease dropper on the qr code wouldn't be able to decrypt anything, they could in theory hijack the pairing (e.g. pair with them instead of the intended person) but they wouldn't also be able to pair with the other person so with the right ui it would be obvious that it didn't work. If somebody gets access to your private key, they can impersonate you but they can't eavesdrop on you. The one time pad would have to be as big as the messages is sent so it would add an over head of at least 100%, an authenticated encryption scheme would have 16 bytes of overhead per message plus 2 messages to set up the session."

The in-person key transfer does (partly, they still transfer it using wifi) clear up one of the issues.  The ""one time pad"" is a giant red flag in any crypto system. Its implementation is almost always by people who read about it on wikipedia, see how easy it is to implement, and see that it's ""unbreakable"" without really having any idea what that actually means.

crypto,30pvv8,Innominate8,2,Sun Mar 29 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"Well, the AES encrypted pad data is only transmitted within the same Wifi whereas the OTP-encrypted messages potentially travel across the internet. I think that's slightly better than transmitting AES encrypted messages over the internet (for some paranoid person that does not fully trust AES). I guess, doing the pad exchange optically as well was too slow. :)  But I share your concerns about authentication. I also would like to know where the randomness is supposed to come from. Also, displaying secret information on a display is probably more of a problem than just displaying a public key. Threema just uses this to avoid MITM attacks where it's no problem if a third person also sees the QR code. Zendo relies on this method for establishing shared secrets. So, you really want to make sure that this QR code is only seen by the two parties who want to safely communicate. Of course, Zendo could also use public key crypto in addition to AES. ;)"
crypto,30pvv8,sellibitze,1 point,Thu Apr 2 11:57:40 2015 UTC,"the difference in theoretical security between AES and OTP is that while (when perfectly implemented) OTP may never be broken, AES (when perfectly implemented) mearly may never be broken before the heat death of the universe.   If one was to not trust AES then the sensible thing would be to choose something like Chacha20 which (like AES-CTR) is more or less a onetime pad derived from a seed. This set up still puts a huge amount of trust in AES as we would hope that they encrypt the OTP while it is being stored on the device and they are are likely using AES for that.  The main thing is just that the OTP doesn't actually cause anything to be more secure then it currently is because OTP solves a problem (send a confidential message after previously securely coming up with a shared secret) that has been solved in better ways already. OTP is just marketing hype."

crypto,30pvv8,Innominate8,12,Mon Mar 30 20:51:03 2015 UTC,"OTP tends to be very badly understood. The security of OTP depends on sharing the key securely, the ability to reliably destroy the key after use, and the addition of some kind of authentication to ensure the message is genuine.   Sharing the key securely is difficult to do on a cell phone, but is about as trustworthy as the rest of the cell phone. In person sharing through something like NFC would be relatively effective. The major threat is backdoors which are an equal problem for any encryption mechanism.  The second is nearly impossible on a smartphone. Securely removing data from cell phones/flash memory is hard to do and once the key is recovered it doesn't just expose some messages, it exposes everything ever sent. OTP depends VERY strongly on the key being securely destroyed after use and the nature of computer storage makes it very hard to do reliably short of physical destruction. Modern crypto avoids this pitfall.  The third is almost always forgotten because for the most part people jumping to using OTP don't really know what they're doing. Cryptography is about more than making sure your messages aren't read, it's about making sure your messages aren't modified as well. OTP on its own is trivial to modify without the key simply by being able to guess the original plaintext. If you somehow know (say via shoulder surfing) that someone sent an OTP encrypted ""Yes"", you could trivially modify it inflight to ""No."" without having the key. Without some kind of message authentication added in, OTP is unusably weak.  Edit: ""OTP"" is something generally jumped on by people who see how easy it is to implement and read on wikipedia  that it is ""unbreakable"". Its use in actual products should always be seen as a giant red flag that they don't know what they're doing."

I think it's a good point to bring up that the app cannot be called secure if the community cannot bring their own people they trust to verify it. One thing is certain that we can all agree-on is that large amount of revenue is generated by selling personal/private data and providing privileged access to people's devices under back-doors, etc... Apple, Microsoft, etc... are very good examples of being successful  selling a product while still providing venues of privileged access to governments, criminals, etc . We can expect to see more kinds of these apps mainly because cryptography also helps to increase the value of the data by making access to it more restricted/exclusive.  edit; An example is Facebook's data would increase in value if the data from their users are protected instead of being captured by competitors who do not have to deal with infrastructure and therefore sell the data in bulk at lower prices. Therefore Facebook being the sole supplier of that type of data would be able to charge more for access to it.

crypto,30mi2r,SpeakerToLampposts,4,Mon Mar 30 05:47:07 2015 UTC,"No, it's just more convenient.  With ADD/SUB, you have to define the word size: am I adding 8 bits at a time, or 32 bits at a time, or 64 bits at a time, or 128 bits at a time, or am I adding the entire streams with infinite carry propagation?  If you add 1 bit at a time, you get XOR.  It affects the security analysis, requiring a complete re-do if you change it, but the net effect on security is expected to be negligible.  For AES in particular, where there are a lot of Galois field based operations, it makes the analysis simpler."
crypto,30mi2r,autowikibot,2,Mon Mar 30 11:38:13 2015 UTC,"I am not a crypto guy, but I am a hardware guy and one observation is if you ever try to build a dedicated IP block to do crypto, you would much prefer to implement an XOR over an ADD. The carry in the add creates performance and power penalties vs an XOR, which is just a couple gates per bit with no interaction between them."
crypto,30mi2r,tmbinc,2,Sun Mar 29 08:48:45 2015 UTC,"Another problem with add/sub that hasn't been mentioned is that it's sensitive to word size and endianness (i.e. which direction carries run between bytes). This means that you have to pick the word size and endianness as part of the cipher protocol, and if you're trying to implement it on a CPU that doesn't match these decisions you'll have implementation issues:   If the CPU supports long-integer arithmetic (longer than the cipher uses), you can't take advantage of it. If the CPU doesn't support add/sub for large enough words you'll have to implement your own carry-between-words (which has a potential to cause data-dependent timing). If the CPU is the wrong endianness you'll either have to swap byte order before & after operations, or implement your own carry between bytes (which'd be a complete mess). Finally, there's a potential for problems dealing with data sizes that aren't divisible by the chosen word length. Defining & handling the necessary padding shouldn't be difficult (except maybe stream ciphers with big-endian carries), but it's something you just don't have to worry about with xor."
crypto,30mi2r,conradsymes,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:54:11 2015 UTC,"Endianness:       The terms endian and endianness refer to the convention used to interpret the bytes making up a data word when those bytes are stored in computer memory. In computing, memory commonly stores binary data by organizing it into 8-bit units called bytes. When reading or writing a data word consisting of multiple such units, the order of the bytes stored in memory determines the interpretation of the data word.  Each byte of data in memory has its own address. Big-endian systems store the most significant byte of a word in the smallest address and the least significant byte is stored in the largest address (also see Most significant bit). Little-endian systems, in contrast, store the least significant byte in the smallest address.   The illustration to the right shows an example using the data word ""0A 0B 0C 0D"" (a set of 4 bytes written out using left-to-right positional, hexadecimal notation) and the four memory locations with addresses a, a+1, a+2 and a+3; then, in big-endian systems, byte 0A is stored in a, 0B in a+1, 0C in a+2 and 0D in a+3. In little-endian systems, the order is reversed with 0D stored in memory address a, 0C in a+1, 0B in a+2, and 0A in a+3.

Additive or subtractive (unless modulo because it's similar to XOR) provides context and ""breadcrumbs"" in the message which can be statistically analyzed or unfolded. XOR is tricking the way our brains think (in terms of a beginning and end for causal relation, thus information) so there is nothing better without rethinking information theory, which may need to happen soon. It's more likely that everything is ALWAYS a 0 and a 1 but people reading it are looking for certain messages. If you could make the message they're looking for more important than the key, then you could have something better than crypto like XOR but that also sounds like telepathy, lol. Right now, you need information and context. If you could make the information CHANGE based on the context of the user, that would be amazing and I think it's the principle behind quantum code/cryptography but someone will have to back me up on that.  The shadow-y goal that people don't talk about anymore behind the implementation of XOR is to compress it somehow, but most will laugh right here because the most you can do is factor evenly (or with prime numbers but now we're talking real crypto, not just theory). Real crypto uses prime numbers (co primes, twin primes) because they are just like 0 or 1, they are unique and have no statistical implications if multiplied in certain ways. Like how a cake can't be unbaked.  You want to make a crypto that is powerful enough to be unhackable/unreadable but is easy enough to implement that a Facebook user on their phone could have a password stored and retrieved. This is the nature of cryptographic symmetry and entropy and is indeed a vicious challenge and is the subject of some of the most important and secret research that anyone is doing right now. Too smart for Watson but dumb enough to work on any device's logic processor.

The core protocol is primitive, and almost all features you expect from a modern chat are only available in extensions. Just look at the list to get an idea how many there are. There's no server and no client that implement all of them, the implementations aren't always compatible to each other (or work at all), and the extensions don't even cover all features you'd want (say, end-to-end encryption – there's GPG and OTR, but they're only bolted on by chat clients and in practice work even more poorly than the rest).  Just like 90% of all e-mail is handled by Google and Microsoft because it's impossible for everyone else to get it right, the biggest XMPP deployments are Facebook's and Google's chats, which are isolated against the rest of the XMPP network.  Edit: What I'm trying to get at is that XMPP is not the solution. It's part of the problem. At best we need new servers and clients that actually implement all the extensions needed to be competitive with a usable UI. At worst it needs to be replaced by something saner."

For extra credit, group chat, but honestly that's an infrequent use case and is better covered using an IRC server. I do use end to end encryption (OTR). OTR is extremely usable, to the point where my client constantly negotiates working OTR connections with people who don't even know they have OTR capability.

It more specifically means pencil and paper, or hand cryptography. There are modern hand ciphers that are built or inspired by modern computer algorithms, such as RC4, that could still be relatively secure, even for modern cryptanalysis.  Some mechanical ciphers, such as the Chaocipher, while they way have shown weaknesses, don't have a ciphertext-only break. There are a couple reasons for this.  First, most doctorate students aren't putting in the time to study them, because the bulk of crypto done today are modern computer algorithms. Some journals might be interested in hand ciphers, but there is little practical use in them. So they provide mostly educational and historical value.  Second, most hand ciphers are iterations or hybrids of already broken algorithms, such as autokey, playfair, or double transposition. Because these are already broken, there is little value in breaking all of their related algorithms, by applying similar methods over and over.  With that said, there is a small group, including myself (http://aarontoponce.org/wiki/card-ciphers) that find studying hand ciphers in our own time rewarding.

In my case, local deduplication would be sufficient.  Now, since I'm not a cryptographer, are any of the above available in standard open source libraries?

Make sure you use a different key for the CMAC portion than you use for the CTR portion.  A second possible pitfall might come up if you opt to take advantage of the associated data part of SIV (the H_1, H_2, etc. in the diagram of the paper I linked). You would need to make sure that when you encode this associated data into a single string, the encoding is unambiguous.

To do better, you might want to read up on the theory of randomness extractors.  Let me give a simple example.  Suppose that you have two bit streams, each of which contains 0.5 bits of entropy per bit.  What happens if you XOR them?  Well. the resultant stream's entropy density could be anywhere between 0.5 and 1.0 bits of entropy per bit, and without knowing more about the streams, you don't know which.  Suppose that one stream has perfectly random even bits, and perfectly predictable odd bits.  0.5 bits of entropy per bit, right?  If you XOR it with another similar stream, you get... the same stream.  The XOR of two perfectly random bits is a perfectly random bits, and the XOR of two perfectly predictable bits is a perfectly predictable bit.  But if you shift the second stream by one bit, so the odd bits are random and the even bits are predictable, the XOR of the two is now perfectly random."

crypto,3058xp,sesoid,25,Tue Mar 24 16:19:19 2015 UTC,"A strong cipher needs to have two properties: confusion and diffusion. Confusion hides the correlation between the ciphertext and key; diffusion hides the patterns in the plaintext. If a cipher is strong (e.g. has both confusion and diffusion), then slightly changing either the key or plaintext would cause large and unpredictable changes in the ciphertext, thus preventing the attacker from ""closing in"" on the key value.  AES is composed of two parts: the SP (substitution-permutation) network and the key schedule. Upon encryption, the key schedule generates several round keys from one encryption key; these keys are then applied to the data block during the encryption rounds of the SP network. The repeated substitution/permutation/key application provides the cipher's confusion and diffusion properties. Wikipedia offers a great explanation of the SP network.  Note that this only applies to AES on a single block, applying AES on multiple blocks involves encryption modes which are a completely different beast altogether."

A large portion of upcoming updates will include optimizations which should make the initial deal significantly faster. I don't expect it to be able to match the performance of traditional client-server gaming but playability and a good user experience are an extremely important part of the software design.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to follow the PDF link you provided but I'm assuming that you're referring to one of the post-""Mental Poker"" papers that describe protocols for similar functionality. In answer to your question, private cards are confidential while strategy is partially and optionally confidential. In practice this means that every ""public"" action in the game, such as betting or receiving encrypted cards, is recorded for independent post-game verification but some actions may be manipulated to eliminate certain information about play. The result is that CypherPoker is able to hide a few pieces of information that would be revealed in a real world game. For example, when a player folds their private cards and crypto keys are not revealed while actions such as betting may be transmitted independently of the player's interaction, thereby eliminating clues in the timing of actions. Hesitation or other ""tells"" may be virtually eliminated and general game play strategy is as observable as it would be in a real world game.  Finally, integrations with cryptocurrencies are planned after optimizations, protocol hardening (preventing non-cryptographic attacks), drop-out/disconnection support, and user interface improvements."

But yes, both LFSRs and block ciphers are ""universal"" in the sense that both move through a permutation, though with vastly different security guarantees.  Universal hash functions also fall into this category to some extent.  In fact, you can think of LFSRs as a polynomial in some finite field, and universal hash functions can be as simple as a linear function.  Here is my wild guess as to what triggered your question: with a truly random function, you expect that there would be collisions in the output.  On the other hand, several cryptographic primitives such as block ciphers, trapdoor permutations, etc. will never exhibit a collision as they are ""impossibly perfectly"" distributed.  This of course follows from the fact they are permutations.  However, when trying to model one with the other, many people have made mistakes in theory and quite likely in implementations as well.  If you are curious about this line of work, you should check out a few of the original papers on the subject:    Luby-Rackoff ""How to construct pseudorandom permutations from pseudorandom functions"" Bellare-Kilian-Rogaway ""The security of cipher block chaining"" Hall-Wagner-Kelsey-Schneier ""Building PRFs from PRPs""   As an aside, the last paper has some interesting authors, including John Kelsey who is now among the top cryptographers at NIST, and Bruce Schneier who is now better known for his security works and activism."

A Modular Encryption standard   what does modular mean? what does standard mean?  The instructions and the rest of the README are not really clear. There are a lot of arbitrary constraints which you don't really explain; you mention ""modules"" but don't really explain what they are or do; and in general you use and misuse a lot of ""crypto"" terms which should really be precisely defined. Other than the README, there is no documentation. There are no comments in the code. The code does a lot of obscure stuff and is not really understandable in a short time. I tried running it and it ungracefully crashed, I imagine due to the wrong amount of plaintext.  The only thing worthy of praise in the whole repository is the amount of time and effort you put into it. I see you are probably 16, and it is really cool that you like cryptography and want to try something first-hand. Cryptography is difficult and it is really a good challenge: it shows that you're not afraid of complexity and abstraction.  I would suggest that you read more about ciphers, how they work and how they are designed; and maybe try to implement some existing ones first, like Caesar, ROT13 or Vigenère. I would also suggest that you write a separate specification explaining what the cipher does, in proper English, with correct or at least consistent vocabulary and notation. After you have done this, write simple, modular, commented code implementing the specification: simple meaning that it is easy to determine what the parts are and how they relate to each other, modular meaning that you use functions (shorter than 130 lines!), commented meaning that you explain what a piece of code does and especially why.  tl;dr this breakable nonstandard encryption program(me) sucks. keep it up!"

crypto,2zxfis,imaleprechaun,5,Sun Mar 22 22:46:54 2015 UTC,"Normally I wouldn't respond to this, but I was bored and kinda  irritated that you disregarded good advice. Now I'm not any kind of expert on cryptography. I'm just a lowly sys admin, and I can tell you that your cipher sucks.  For one thing, your program is a mess. It doesn't work right; I had to do a bit of work just to get it working (and I used to debug code for a living). In the future, don't hard code so much info, comment more, don't use windows conventions in you program, and for the love of God include a paper explaining what your cipher is actually doing. If its impossible to tell what your program is doing after a few minutes, you probably did something wrong.  I still have no idea what your program is doing, but I can still tell you what you did wrong.   You program treats numbers and letters differently and its clearly visible in the ciphertext. numbers followed by ""xx"" are numbers and ""x"" are letters. This alone is enough to tell me that your ""encryption"" is shit. I put encryption in quotes because its not and encryption scheme, its a complicated substitution cipher. Read about them, they are easy to break because they leak a lot of info. Clearly distinguishable from random information. For a encryption scheme to be considered secure, it needs to be indistinguishable from random noise. Known plaintext attack. Your cipher will leak the key if the plaintext of the message is known. This is a flaw. Any modern encryption scheme needs to be immune to know plaintext attacks.   Just because someone can't or is unwilling to to decrypt your code doesn't mean it can't be done. If I cared to do so, I could probably get your above message decrypted in a few hours. If I had a few days, I could come up with a general program that decrypts your program without the key. I don't have a few days or even hours so I'll just tell you what an attacker would do. (Even if he/she did not have access to the source code)  Your cipher is obviously some sort of substitution cipher. There are 928 distinct characters in your 34617 character message. Given that some of the numbers seem to be duplicates with random information attached to it (which would be rare in a truly random situation), I would bet the actual number is quite a bit lower. The code can then be put under frequency analysis. With a little bit of computer work, you could find words in the cipher. Once a few words were figured out (if someone had access to the source code), the key could be recovered from the text. Then its simple a matter of decrypting with the discovered key.  The code you pasted above has the following frequency of characters (with your code converted to unicode characters for space): {'˥': 13, 'ă': 11, 'Ϋ': 18, 'ȵ': 18, 'ā': 3, 'ǋ': 6, 'ɉ': 13, 'ɲ': 18, 'с': 14, 'Θ': 6, 'ʌ': 11, '˕': 3, '͖': 20, 'ʭ': 2, '́': 24, '̓': 7, 'Ƨ': 17, 'Ã': 3, 'Ǎ': 3, 'č': 3, 'ħ': 20, 'ȸ': 2, 'Ȑ': 19, 'Â': 14, '˚': 18, 'á': 3, 'Ǳ': 43, '̾': 18, 'ƨ': 19, 'Υ': 3, 'Ȣ': 13, 'ͦ': 13, 'ȝ': 6, 'ʟ': 3, 'ʠ': 17, '²': 20, 'Є': 14, 'Ρ': 3, 'Ŀ': 19, 'ƛ': 13, 'Ě': 19, 'Ǔ': 4, 'з': 3, 'ɶ': 14, 'Ƥ': 3, 'đ': 1, 'Ȫ': 13, 'Ä': 6, 'Ď': 3, 'Č': 18, 'ϟ': 4, 'ť': 18, 'ɿ': 11, '͏': 6, 'À': 3, 'ő': 3, 'í': 3, 'ȡ': 3, 'в': 3, 'ʐ': 1, 'ò': 3, 'ķ': 848, 'ȥ': 4, 'ϣ': 3, 'Ͳ': 3, 'ŝ': 3, ... } I removed a chunk because it was too long, but you get the idea. Your encrypted message clearly has a patter to it.  I recommended reading ""An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography"" by Hoffstein, Pipher, Silverman. Everything that I mentioned above can be found in that book, and you can learn why your cipher isn't very good. Also realize that you don't know nearly enough to make a good cipher yet. Work hard and maybe in a decade you will be able to make something that is actually good.  Edit: I read your previous post about what your program is doing. It makes a little more sense now. Its a kind of polyalphabetic cipher, basically a Vigenere cipher with the prime factors of the key file as the Vigenere key. You then do some unnecessary math to obfuscate the cipher. Adding unnecessary operations like that does nothing to increase the quality of cipher, it just makes it more confusing to people trying to understand your program. Look up Vigenere cipher and you can see why it is not secure.  Edit 2: After a minute of thought, your cipher is even worse than I said earlier. Because you divide by one prime factor and the multiply by the others. All an attacker needs to do is find the prime factors of each encoded character. For example, if every 3 out of every 4 characters in your ciphertext are divisible by 2, 3 out of 4 divisible by 3, 3 out of 4 divisible by 5, 3 out of 4 divisible by 7, your key is clearly 210. By adding the unused information back into the cipher by multiplying it, you leak more information than if you had simply left it out."

This is a lower standard than knowing the person super well, but higher than just seeing ID once. I will sometimes sign keys if I get the chance to examine a US passport or an in-state license from my own state, where I know what the document looks like. I really have no way to make sense of pre-electronic passports from Elbonia. Anyone sending you files ought to be verifying your full ID in some other way. If you're sending unencrypted, unsigned email, the key ID be modified in transit, anyway.   I've come around to being a fan of the Keybase approach: even though the actual names are a centralized directory run by Keybase, the protocol is all publicly-verifiable, and hashes of their DB are stored in the Bitcoin blockchain periodically, so you don't need to trust Keybase at all to verify that the information on their site is accurate.

However, I've heard that advertising anything less than the full public key is insecure because a Key ID can potentially be matched up to other keys rather then your own.   How much hand-holding are you willing to do in terms of helping other people manage their risks? It's important to answer this, because the more you're willing to take on in terms of helping other people use PGP/GnuPG safely with you, the more complexity and effort you'll need to go to.  If I want your public key, what I should do is search keyservers for your ID (key ID, name and email, etc.), get all keys there, and do all the following:   attempt to establish veracity through the web of trust; e.g. check that your key is signed by at least one key that has a signature chain leading back to my circle of trusted signing keys use a trusted side channel to verify the key fingerprint with you Send you an encrypted message with a challenge, and have you verify the response via a trusted side channel   For #1, this is quite hard, because the web of trust hasn't reached critical mass for this to happen reliably.  For #2 and 3, your side channel can be public (no confidentiality) but it must have high authenticity. Face to face is probably the easiest and best, but isn't always possible.   Services like keybase.io are trying to get a reasonable path here, by allowing someone to demonstrate that they have control of both a given key and a set of accounts (an attacker would have to compromise multiple points to trick people into using a key they control).  Depending on the level of trust you need (not every communication requires ultimate trust), things like phone calls, SMS, or messages on social platforms may be adequate. If you trust that a person has control of their Twitter account for the window in which you perform verification, then you can also trust the key you verify through that channel."

crypto,2zsmnb,disclosure5,3,Sun Mar 22 21:57:07 2015 UTC,"Hi.  I'm a cryptographer, and also sort of a Haskell programmer, but I am not familiar with the state of Haskell cryptography except as shown in your post.  Here's some feedback on your points.  RdRand:  I don't recommend using RdRand as the sole source of entropy if you have a good alternative.  But it's pretty hard to be secure against backdoors inserted by the company who fabbed your CPU, especially on a network-connected machine.  Cryptographically mixing RdRand is definitely the right thing to do, but I don't think it's outrageous for a library author to choose not to do it.  Modulo:  You're right about modulo bias.  To generate random numbers mod N, the most common practice I've seen among cryptographers is to generate a number 128 bits (or whatever) longer than you need, and then reduce.  This reduces the modulo bias to a negligible level.  Rejection sampling (like you mentioned) also works, but is considered unfavorable because it takes variable time and draws a variable amount of entropy from the source.  However, please note that neither reduction mod N nor your rejection sampling method is guaranteed to take constant time in Haskell with respect to the output.  This means that it may expose your code to side-channel attacks.  I don't known of a good defense against this for Haskell Integers, but maybe someone named Don or Simon can help you.  AES-NI: You have misinterpreted Colin's post on AES-NI: he's asking for a language feature that doesn't exist, not bashing AES-NI.  I don't know of any language which makes any effort to keep secrets out of registers/memory after you return, other than asm or maaaaybe languages with inline asm or heavy use of volatile and intrinsics (C, D, etc).  In Haskell the garbage collector can copy or leave around any secret key which is used by pure code, and there's no way to overwrite it with zeros in most cases.  Even in asm you cannot always keep keys out of memory, since in a context switch your keys can be pushed to the operating system's stack.  Again it is theoretically possible that Intel has backdoored AES-NI, but AES-NI's resistance to timing attacks is important, so using AES-NI is considered best practice.  AES modes: You are correct that many modes for AES are dangerous.  However, implementors have a dilemma: since the use of these algorithms is so common, they are all but required to provide them in general purpose libraries.  Perhaps putting it in an Unsafe module would help, though.  SJCL, for example, gates CBC mode behind  sjcl.beware[""CBC mode is dangerous because it doesn't protect message integrity.""]();    Galois: I don't know much about them in particular, but just because someone has ties with a government doesn't mean that they write backdoored crypto.  However, it is worth noting that the pure Haskell implementation of RSA is vulnerable to a timing attack.  There may not be a defense against that attack in a pure Haskell, and it would certainly be much more complex than that code."

Seems like saying, ""I want random, but I want a random between 5 and 10"" and, ""I want random, but it has to be evenly divisible by x"" are simply different ways of taking randomness and making it less random. I get the modulo bias idea - if you use mod 3 in the decimal number system it'll never line up evenly and therefore certain remainders come back more/less often. I just don't see why looping rand() until the random number fits the wanted range is a strictly better idea. Now that I've written this, I'm sure there's a deep mathematical reason it's better, but I'm not that math-y. At least, not yet."

By the time an HSM comes out, it is usually outdated or the algorithms are just not adequate.  Often times you'll see RSA based crypto when the cyber security community is abandoning that ship.  You'll even see SHA-1 on these HSMs as well!!! At any rate, I would say that you should ask the question again by specify a time span (1 second, 1 minute, 1 year, etc.) and a key pair.

Some can store ""wrapped"" (encrypted) keys to the host computer and retrieve them / use them later and then it's just a matter of how big an HDD you have.

That's how most TPM blobs are stored.  Attestation Identity Keys (AIKs) are typically stored in this way. AIKs are not aliases of the EK - an AIK is a key which is generated within the TPM, exported as a blob wrapped with the SRK; the public half of the AIK is exported to be signed by a Privacy CA. The secret half of the AIK is never exported from the TPM in cleartext.

crypto,2zjrbo,spap-oop,4,Sun Jul 12 11:12:36 2015 UTC,"TPMs provide some useful primitives that a system can leverage to increase its security posture.   The bad image of loss of control isn't due to the TPM itself, but rather because of the manufacturers of systems that integrate a TPM who choose to lock the platform down to pre-provisioned keys locked down in the TPM's NVRAM. A system with an unprovisioned TPM truly belongs to the individual, not the manufacturer.  The ability to measure the system is pretty powerful but it has the ability to be abused. In its purest form, it allows the owner of a system to ensure level of trust in the firmware and software. The ownership, however, can be subverted to be the manufacturer ensuring trust in a locked down configuration.  The actual implementation of TPMs themselves is a little dated. The algorithms in 1.2 are a little crusty, though 2.0 is fixing this somewhat. Remote attestation is a pretty cool tool.  As for not trusting the silicon, until you own a foundry, that battle cannot be easily won. All the modern CPU designs manufactured today have some sort of lock down. Choosing where to draw the lines is the important part."

This is a no-issue. If that is the case and the CPU is being tampered with in such a way as to perform this kind of sophisticated attack, then why does one xor even matter? As he points out already: ""This is the CPU, remember. It can pretty much do anything it wants.""  Changing the number generation to exclude rdrand isn't going to improve security.

Using RSA, here is a way to achieve your goals:  Setup   Person A generates SIGN_KEYPAIR_A Person A generates ENCRYPT_KEYPAIR_A Person B generates SIGN_KEYPAIR_B Person B generates ENCRYPT_KEYPAIR_B   Person B sends message to Person A   Person B generates/encodes message M Person B encrypts M with public key of ENCRYPT_KEYPAIR_A (more on this later) ... call result C Person B signs C with private key of SIGN_KEYPAIR_B Person B sends signed C to Person A   Person A reads signed and encrypted message from Person B   Person A verifies signature using the public key from SIGN_KEYPAIR_B Person A decrypts C using private key from SIGN_KEYPAIR_A Person A reads M   Notes:   It is not efficient to encrypt an entire message with a recipient's public key so in practice most people will generate a random symmetric key, use that to encrypt the message, and then encrypt the symmetric key with the recipient's public key. Since the symmetric key is usually much smaller than the message this is more efficient. This process is sometimes referred to as enveloping. It is generally considered good practice to generate separate keys for signing and enciphering. Not all people do this though (but that doesn't mean you should copy those bad habits!). In addition to verifying signatures, you must also verify that the public key does in fact belong to the person you think it does.

crypto,2z9769,macgillebride,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:46:50 2015 UTC,"the basics,  encryption uses a public key (the recipients).  decryption uses a private key.  signing involves decrypting a plaintext.  The result is gibberish that when encrypted using the signer's public key gives plaintext.  If the plaintext is meant to be secret to one person, then often also signing it is not important.  You can sign an encrypted text, but the signature is mainly useful to the recipient.  You cannot prove to anyone else that you signed a valid message unless you (or recipient) provides the plaintext to anyone who wants to verify the signature.  A strange attack in this scenario would be to craft a different public key (you don't even need to know the private key), that results in a different plaintext encryption, and so forges a signature to an arbitrary message.  So signcryption with RSA is only useful for the 2 people exchanging messages, unless there is a public key repository, and a manual process for proving signatures to 3rd parties.   since person B's decrypting key is public, i guess anyone can read ""This message is from person A""    The decrypting key is the private one, and even when you sign a plaintext message the only way to know that you signed it is to ""ask the message if you signed it""   Can person B add the signature first then encrypt using A's public key?   You can do the reverse of that order.  When you sign a message you forward both the signature, and what the decoded signature should evaluate to (plaintext).  That plaintext can be encrypted if it is meant to be private to recipient, but doing so may create a forgery vulnerability to the signer."

The next time Alice and Bob connect, they exchange Bloom filters of all the shared secrets they know, compute an intersection and use some sort of HMAC scheme to detect false positives and confirm mutual knowledge of the shared secret.  Could this work? I can imagine some attacks on privacy here, e.g. preimage attacks on the Bloom filter or saturating the Bloom filter to force the other party to test all shared secrets.

Always sending signed hello-packets encrypted with the public keys of all of the intended recipients Bitcoin stealth address style, you create new ECDSA public keys for the recipient derived from a fresh public key of yours and their current public key using ECDH key exchange plus EC multiply with the shared secret key and their public key.

They can decrypt by repeating the key exchange and using the shared secret key and derive the correct new private key, and thus being able to decrypt the message.

Every time you are gonna send money in an envelope, you are going to include a unique code which is associated with the day for which the payment is due. For the insurance company to charge you for the next day, they have to state the code associated with a payment for the day before. So when they get the envelop with your cancellation they will not be able to avoid it. They can try to fake a code to fool you, but it is not gonna work (how do you fake another code for the same day???). To make this more fair this log book has to be shared with a 3rd party, to prove that you are not cheating, for example the mason can sign it everyday (so you would have witnesses that you did change the code). Third party is only required for legal issues in the case insurance company does not trust you and is going to check for foul play. Solution to this could be a special book, ink and a stamp (with watch in it). You would have to use the book and unerasable ink to write the codes and stamp over them with the stamp to prove that you did it on time.

The real question is the protection of the key: in order to interact with the disk, your Mac has to keep the FV key in memory to encrypt and decrypt blocks. That key exists in memory while the computer is turned on. The only two ways to get it out of memory are to turn off the computer or to hibernate the computer (sleep to disk), in which case the key is written to disk along with the rest of the memory contents prior to hibernation. While the computer is on but locked, your key is in memory in the clear, so if someone were to dump the contents of RAM, they would be able to pull out the key.

Pass 1 - HMAC(Token, APISecret) => HMAC1, HMAC(Token + Expiry, HMAC1) => HMAC2  You can take this further and start including the exact command you want ran (or at least a scope) as part of the client generated token, that way an attacker not only has a very limited time to use a token but they can only repeat the same command."

I checked my implementation ... one countermeasure we do is we DER decode the payload but then check the DER length to what the pkcs #1 de-padding routine gave us.  So if there were garbage after the end of the data it would be caught because the lengths wouldn't match.

If you've been using the app for awhile, it sounds like you've already put your trust in Open Whisper Systems.  The things I took from the post were:   Better, more reliable message delivery. (Switching to the use of data instead of SMS/MMS) Better, more secure handing of message metadata. (Use of the TextSecure message protocol) The ability to communicate with iPhone users.    When you get right down to it, your message is still encrypted.  Additionally something that many here seem to forget is that TextSecure still does more than send encrypted messages.

BIND was a bloated mess with weekly vulnerabilities, it encouraged authoritative servers to be recursive by default (the legacy of which is a major problem today) when in reality it should have been a totally separate daemon. The zone file format was hideous for automated tools.   BIND10 was, from its outset, designed pretty much around djbdns (whether they acknowledged it or not) with a modular set of services, a dynamic database format that doesn't take a reload to read.

The top, smaller disc has an indicator too, it points to letters on the frame. The letter on the frame is then the letter you end up sending/receiving.

crypto,2xt7o6,kandi_kid,3,Wed Mar 4 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"This mostly has to do with servers offerring lower grade-encryption as an option (not by default) and clients like Android and iOS that will obey fallbacks on encryption to lower grades.  Chrome and Firefox were affected until November-ish of 2014 for similar encryption fallback attacks.  Servers that don't offer the lower grade encryption in the first place aren't affected at all, but apparently some government websites were still coded to support it.  As for apps, the SSL library is a shared one by most OSes, so it depends.  If the app communicates with a remote server using some sort of API (Facebook, Pandora, anything that streams, anything that does cloud stuff), then it likely uses the same SSL library.  That being said, most SSL libraries also offer hard coded encryption algorithms to be passed in, so it depends on the application.  Sometimes people call it strictly, sometimes they just call a generic URL library that has ""https://"" tacked on the beginning of it.  So to answer your question, a lot has to go wrong for this to affect an app.  If the server offers bad encryption standards as an option and the code is calling a generic ""let's do SSL"" function, then yes.  It's not even that weak by default for most servers, though, but apparently the article states that 1/3rd of the internet has bad fallback options.  That's not likely to be the case if the company who produces the app isn't stupid. If you upgrade the OS, though, the apps will be fixed automatically in most cases.  Apps won't have to be updated to fix it unless they hard code a bad crypto algorithm, but that's their own damn fault if they do that and it's not technically a FREAK bug at that point.   Connections to Google’s search Web site are not affected by the flaw.   That's because Google doesn't provide the lower level encryption in the first place.  The link provided in the article shows some analysis on some domains that are affected, which could be useful if you are trying to find a specific app that is affected: https://freakattack.com/  I'm curious why you ask, are you an app developer yourself, or are you concerned about your phone's security?  As long as you upgrade your devices when the patch is available to the OS, you should be fine.   Travelers also are vulnerable whenever they log onto the Internet from a hotel, for example.   I'd like to point out that travelers are vulnerable to about 9000 vulnerabilities whenever they log onto the Internet from a hotel that are worse than this one.  Hotels need to actually provide real security on their networks FFS."

It sounds like I'm mostly screwed, even though my Gmail and Google account should still be fine. Sadly, since I don't have a good overview of what other apps might be sensitive, this is making things difficult. Many of my apps don't request full network access though; I'm paranoid when it comes to that, so that's good at least.   I'd like to point out that travelers are vulnerable to about 9000 vulnerabilities whenever they log onto the Internet from a hotel that are worse than this one.

crypto,2xl27e,K3rb3ro5,2,Mon Mar 2 13:22:10 2015 UTC,I seem to have misunderstood your initial use case you want to encrypt multiple files with a single encryption command. This program only operates on single files. Most unix style programs will only operate on a single file at a time.   You could put all the files you want to encrypt in a single directory. Then tar that directory into a tar archive file with tar. Then encrypt the tar archive with threefizer or pgp or openssl. This would solve the problem of the program only operating on a single file at a time.   Not sure if this is the solution you are looking for. As for programs for gnu linux that encrypt/decrypt a multitude of files in just one operation I don't know of any.

If you have enough access to the ball to steal it there is a pretty good chance you have enough access to log reads. In that case you don't even need the actual ball data, just a list of all the offsets that have been accessed. If in brute forcing password you find a result that decodes to a value where all the pointers are in your set of known accessed values then that's a match. With 10 random pointers the odds of a collision are really, really low.  The size of accessed values to be exfiltrated will then only need to be (pointer count * number of users * pointer size) which should be a very manageable amount of data."

crypto,2x7hfj,floodyberry,2,Thu Feb 26 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"2 thoughts, first the dump is likely to be passwords plus user data, so 100,000 users, say 32 byte hash (256 bit) would be like ~3MB, but it's not going to just be that it's going to be usernames maybe real names, birthdays, or addresses or maybe they just vacuum the entire table.  Leading to much larger dump sizes.   Now let's think about realistic sizes of your random file. You have to think of it as your secret key, because of you lose it you now no longer are able to verify users, so you have to be able to back it up.  You need to be able to deploy it securely onto new servers. You also don't want to have to pay extra for disk space. Many cloud platforms have limited disk space on smaller instances and encourage you to use things like elastic block store for storing data.   Now you likely don't want to use ebs to store the random data because that would be pretty easy to dump, so instead we need an ec2 instance with a hard drive. A m3.medium one has a 4gb one, so that would allow for a random table that is a GB, to have room for a 100GB one we'd need a c3.4xlarge instance.

However, in this scheme, it would appear that the input hash, is used to derive the fake hash. Assuming a chained, keyed, perfect hash function, only the original input would be able to set the state to generate the fake hash, for that derived (from input hash) input. Of course, that doesn't mean that the different hash paths won't generate the same output, as any keyed phash can generate all values within the output range, only once. However, I don't think this is a keyed hash system...  In such a system, generating fake hashes would be as simple as incrementing the hash key used by both parties, and hashing..anything really. Of course, that's a rather predictably naive method.  I think the security of this system is less than two keyed 256 bit perfect hash functions, with the first ouput hash used as the hash key for the original input's 2nd hash operation.

crypto,2x7hfj,merkle_jerkle,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:01:55 2015 UTC,"There's a very nice paper I read recently called ""The Quest to Replace Passwords"".  It looks like this scheme is similar (in terms of threat model, interaction between entities, etc., not in terms of actual operation) to server-side iterated hashing, except that the server-side salt is gigantic and hard to steal. Which is to say, if you would use server-side iterated hashing, but you're worried about the salt being stealable, then this solves problems. If you're worried about any other problems, this doesn't solve them any better than server-side iterated hashing does. (And sometimes worse: often you can move some of the hashing to the client side for enhanced protection against a compromised connection. This scheme doesn't have an equivalent for that.)  Furthermore, it's not totally clear that this is actually easier / simpler for developers to use than iterated hashing. Seeking around a gigantic array of random data is going to be fairly difficult to do, especially for a website with multiple servers (does each server keep a copy of this data? do we need to buy special hard disks so we can fit a large enough random key?).  In the framework of ""The Quest to Replace Passwords,"" this has (I think) no advantages at all over passwords. Which makes sense, because it is a password-based scheme. It is a cute idea, but I don't think it's lined up well with either the deployment considerations of hashed passwords, or the problems with passwords in general."

We should assume that if an attacker can perform an offline attack, then he has that big array, and if he has that big array, then his system is as secure as the system he's trying to fix.  What he's doing is just trying to avoid offline attacks. And this demands:   monitoring of the traffic (irl and on the internet) somewhere to store the big array a system that prevents errors to happen in this big array (otherwise a lot of users might not be able to login anymore)   And this is not really cryptography to me.

US tech companies are left being unable to compete in the marketplace as foreign products must be chosen to avoid known security holes. It further leaves all of us vulnerable to meddling by other countries.   When you're mandating that all crypto can be broken, the more often the capability is used the more likely the secret backdoor key is to leak. When that key leaks you're left with a security catastrophe that would make heartbleed look harmless.  If you go on to require everyone in the US to use backdoored crypto. It's just not possible to actually prevent people from using strong crypto, it's literally trying to ban certain kinds of math. This is where things get truly bad.   With backdoored crypto we have the potential for criminalizing the mere use of unbackdoored encryption.

The thing is that I've always seen GPG as the asymmetric encryption swiss-army knife, much like OpenSSL is for symmetric encryption. GPG is mostly primitively sound, ""1990s encryption"" or not. What isn't is how GPG is marketed and designed for ordinary people. I'm more apt to blame the interfaces that use GPG for messaging, not GPG itself, for its shortcomings."

In my opinion, they're both terrible in different ways and the available crypto software we have to work with is a sad state of affairs. Also OpenSSL is hardly a swiss-army knife for (a)symmetric crypto.

First thing I did was clone the git repo. I don't know if it's sitting on some guy's 56K modem but it took a few solid minutes longer than any repository I've ever cloned before. Then I ran autogen.sh.  These scripts are usually a dozen lines long, this one is a 12K shell script, with an accompanying autogen.rc - just to generate the autoconf environment. I ran it and, what do you know, it complains it needs a more recent version of autotools to build. It's odd that software with such a legacy base won't compile from trunk with latest tools shipping with RedHat, so let's move on.  I grabbed the latest stable download, 2.1.2. There's no direct download, you find a mirror, then until you find the tarball, then download it. Upon running ./configure, what would you know, but there are three separate libraries that it now tells me it's dependant on. No, I'm not talking about something common like zlib either. A notable example is libgpg-error, which appears to be a dedicated library for GPG's error handling. Which I'm expected to download, compile and install before trying to build GPG. I spent a few minutes hunting around for appropriate versions, downloading and trying to compile, before concluding I'd sunk an hour into evaluating a product I wasn't even close to getting to compile and threw in the towel.

There is a third party server which basically stores the parameters needed for a client to set up an OTR conversation without any input from the destination user.

Email delivery hasn't barely changed in 20 years and STARTTLS is a (relatively) big change - even though they only have 3 configuration lines to change.  Another reason is that STARTTLS is a very poor protection as it is used now. Any certificate would be accepted (including self-signed). Certificates signed by CAs are better but not the norm. Last but certainly not least, it's trivial when hijacking a connection to pretend the remote server doesn't support STARTTLS and downgrade to plaintext. NSA can do this today with Quantum insert.  There are no common mechanism to publish the level of security expected from email servers (such as a fingerprint of certificates in DNS, or mecanisms like DKIM), so everyone is left to its own when having to decide if an email should be delivered when a security exception occurs. Mail admins hate change so they take the least secure way.  (I don't hate mail admins. Just imagine if guys at gmail at to take security decision for every STARTTLS connection that's breaking, self-signed certificate that changes or sudden mail server change)."
crypto,2x28jm,aris_ada,2,Wed Feb 25 10:54:07 2015 UTC,"Largely, you're correct, however:  First, there have been massive increases in starttls adoption.  At the time of the snowden leaks, only Gmail, yahoo and MySpace (really) supported it out of the top 30 us webmail and top 30 ISPs.  Now virtually all of them do.  Second, yes STARTTLS is subject to trivial attack by an active attacker.  However, mounting a mitm attack on mail servers is a different order of difficulty from mitmproxy in a coffee house.  Clearly it is a risk to be concerned with.  In some regulated industries (financial/medical/legal) it is common to enforce mandatory starttls for established business partnerships.  Certificate validation is another issue.  On the one hand, again encryption alone defeats a passive attacker, and an active attacker can force you down to plain text.  EV certs don't help because they don't surface ui to mail (I guess a spam filter could take validation into consideration).  STARTTLS would be a good use for ACME dv registration, I'm not sure if the EFF is considering that."

This is under the premise of a fully bootable truecrypt container.
crypto,2we6c7,cunttard,2,Fri Feb 20 00:31:38 2015 UTC,That is not true.  You normally provision truecrypt on the OS.  If not using it as an FDE you decrypt while running the OS.  If not the keys are in RAM while the machine is running.  Those are just a few things. If you think the OS is compromised it absolutely could compromised your encryption solution.

If Windows is agnostic then the OS is not a threat in this specific circumstance because the encryption mechanism and drive is completely separate to the OS, otherwise I would otherwise concede your point."
crypto,2we6c7,cunttard,2,Fri Feb 20 17:09:29 2015 UTC,"I think truecrypt may call on the platform or the OS for certain things, maybe it was the rbg?, but I don't remember what specifically.    Other than that windows would have no effect if you assume windows is not compromised.   However if windows was evil, it could certainly be able to extract keys from volatile memory, undermine provisioning, compromise your data during operation, etc.  The only case where you might be able to use a compromised OS and rely on an FDE to protect you would be and FDE that is not provisioned on the OS and has h integrity checking of all plaintext non-volatile memory and the device would have to have no network connectivity or connections to other non-volatile memory that is not protected by the FDE.  That is a very limited scenario and not very useful.  You can probably layer some other security measures to mitigate the risk of the OS extracting keys (like self encrypting drives) or sending plaintext data over the network to external sources.  But really you really need to have some level of trust in the OS."
crypto,2we6c7,xJoe3x,1 point,Sat Feb 21 01:14:21 2015 UTC,"There's a reason that the plausible deniability instructions for FDE are so specific - the OS can give away any of your data it has access to, as long as there's an escape vector for that data.  If you are going to seal ALL data leaks (true plausible deniability) there is a quite complex set of steps to go through. You create a Windows system with absolutely no escape vector for the data, and only then can you access your hidden-encrypted data. If there is ever an escape vector created, then your system and all your data is considered compromised for purposes of plausible deniability."

You have a huge cache of documents, you want to protect their data but also protect the fact that you have them. An FDE without escape vectors (pre-loaded with software to process the documents) is a good environment to work on the data before you hand it over to another party.  You could even side-load new programs onto your main FDE OS by downloading them on a separate temporary FDE OS, mounting the temporary FDE from your main FDE OS, and then securely erasing the temporary FDE OS. If you mirrored your main FDE beforehand, you wouldn't even have to worry about your data being manipulated by malicious programs.  I suppose the big downside is that you can only share all of the data, or none of the data, there's no middle ground."

If someone is after you, then FDE will only protect you so far, unless you never turn the machine on. If you don't trust the OS enough to provide the FDE, how can you trust it enough to really use it with any meaningful data.

For clarity, that paper is applying to extending the digest output size with the same cryptographic hash function. Or, in otherwords, taking the RIMEMD-128 of a file, followed by also taking the RIPEMD-160 of the same file. There should be 2128 * 2160 = 2288 total possible digests, with 2144 required for a collision, but it turns out not to be the case, when using the same cryptographic hash.

crypto,2wbp92,atoponce,13,Wed Feb 18 20:32:18 2015 UTC,"If I understand your question correctly, you want to know that if you provide a MD5 and SHA-256 of a file, together, if finding identical MD5 and SHA-256 digest collisions simultaneously is more difficult than finding just a single MD5 or SHA-256 collion.  The answer is yes. The reason is the product of the two cryptographic hashing functions.  To demonstrate this, suppose we take the MD5 of a file. There is a theoretical range of 2128 possible digests. If we also take the SHA-256 of the same file, then the range of that is 2256 possible digests. If I wish to find a colission on both MD5 and SHA-256 digests, then I would need know the range of digests. This can be calculated with:  2^128 * 2^256 = 2^384   So, you would have the same theoretical digest range as a SHA-384 cryptographic hashing function.  You may think, ""why not just provide the SHA-384 to begin with?"" That's certainly a valid question, but there is some value to providing cryptographic hashes that use different constructions. The SHA2 functions all use the Merkle–Damgård construction, while the newly apprived by NIST SHA3 cryptographic functions use the sponge construction. By providing both the SHA-256 and the SHA3-256 digests of a file, should guarantee security, such that if there is something fundamentally wrong with either the Merkle–Damgård or sponge constructions, the other digest should still hold strong for data integrity.  Of course, this comes at the cost of increased time calculating the digest for both functions, and it may not be worth it in all scenarios, or even most. But it's something to think about, and might have application in some instances."
crypto,2wbp92,atoponce,-1,Wed Feb 18 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, because you would have to find a file such that both hashes are correct which will happen much less frequently then a single hash (VERY much less frequently).  Having said that, you should be able to get the same effect by using a sufficiently strong hashing algorithm say SHA512 instead of SHA256.  Also if you wanted to make it take longer for someone to find the correct hash, you could use multiple rounds of something like 512 to increase the amount of time it takes to do the brute force calculations."

This means fread() will return either 1 or 0 as I'm asking it to read a single item of the full length of bytes, 1 if it successfully read the full length or 0 in the case that it failed to read or failed to read the full length.    Derp.  I'm tired, and I mentally flipped the arguments.  Mea culpa.    If you really must use /dev/urandom, perform additional sanity checking (See the 2nd example listed here).   Most of these sanity checks seem excessive, I don't think a test for  /dev/urandom being a block device serves any real purpose in a  lightweight library. Not on any system I've used at least. I'm not  trying to be OpenSSL here. :)   It's a light weight library that generates keys that have the potential to be long lived (In particular Ed25519 keypairs).  In that light I think that checking that /dev/urandom is actually /dev/urandom and not, say a textfile seems like a reasonable thing to do, and the code isn't  excessive.    Write platform specific code to avoid using /dev/urandom when superior alternatives exist. And, no I don't mean /dev/random. Under Linux, this would be ""getrandom(2)"", for Linux >= 3.17, ""arc4random_buf(3)"" for OpenBSD >= 5.5 (Or ""getentropy(2)"").   I like this idea, but again, the purpose in mind here is tiny tools and such. Linux's getrandom was only introduced recently, is not supported on many systems yet, and OpenBSD's is equivalent to their usual /dev/urandom except in extreme circumstances (ex: too many file handles). It'd be extra code for very little benefit except in extreme circumstances.   A system call versus 3 system calls, assuming unbuffered IO without extra sanity checking vs getrandom/getentropy.  If you detect that you can use OpenBSD arc4random, it's 1 getentropy call, every 16 chacha blocks."

A quick and dirty benchmark suggests:   getrandom() - 2 usec. open()/read()/close() - 2.5 usec. fopen()/fread()/fclose() - 350 usec.   Standard disclaimers regarding turbo boost, the phase of the moon, and it being a quick and dirty benchmark apply.  The syscall where it's supported has the added benefit of getting to skip the sanity checking I would be doing if I were going to read from /dev/urandom."
crypto,2w07oe,baconridge,0,Mon Feb 16 18:17:07 2015 UTC,I disagree - a path on your filesystem being an actual file does not imply anything about system compromise.  The assumption that some particular file is semantically an unbounded stream of random values seems like a pretty broad one for a library author to make who doesn't even know the platform on which a developer might deploy a system.

However, the increase in entropy is extremely small due to the nature of exponential sums. With a 72 character alphabet, allowing variable length passwords only increases entropy by ~0.0201 bits. Even with just 36 characters, it's only 0.0406 bits.  Now, assuming that you choose a password completely at random, more entropy is still better than less.   However this requires that you are truly picking it at random and hence the attacker has no particular reason to start guessing shorter passwords first. In the real world, some people pick weak passwords and hence attacks will always try weak passwords first. Therefore, the very very tiny increase in entropy is not worth the very real risk that attackers will guess your password sooner.  The same principle applies to making your your password contains symbols and numbers. In theory, the additional constraints decrease entropy, but the decrease is small and reduces the risk of an attacker guessing it quickly (or showing up in a rainbow table)."

crypto,2vzy1y,atoponce,1 point,Sun Feb 15 20:41:41 2015 UTC,"Sure. Entropy is calculated by:  H = L * log2(N)   Where H is your entropy estimate, L is the length of your password, log2() is the base-2 log function, and N is the total size of possibilities you are picking your password from.  For example, if you chose a password that is only lowercase characters, then N would be 26. Thus, if the password is being chosen at random, then each character provides 4.7 bits of entropy. So, an 8 character password, in this example, would provide about 37.6 bits of entropy.  The larger L is, the more entropy in the system. This all assumes that the password is chosen from the random events. As soon as you start manipulating it, the entropy goes down.  If you are using Diceware, then there are 7,776 possibilites for each roll. Thus, N = 7776. So, each word provides about 12.92 bits of entropy. Six rolls (L) would provide about 77.54 bits in the system."

crypto,2vzy1y,monty845,2,Sun Feb 15 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"Lets go with a password with Upper case, Lower Case, Numbers and the ten shift characters your numbers. that gives us 72 characters. A mandatory 50 character password is 7250. A password that can be any number of characters up to 49 is 7349 - 1.  So 50 Characters exactly has 7.4x1092 possible passwords. All possible password lengths 49 characters or less has 2.0x1091 passwords. 50 or fewer characters has 7.6x1092 possible passwords. So IF you password generator chooses a password with 49 or fewer characters, you loose more than an order of magnitude from the crack difficulty. If it chooses a 50 character one, (72/73 chance), having added the possibility of having less than 50 only increases the crack difficulty by a few percent.  I would conclude that removing the risk of having that weaker 49 or fewer character password outweighs the added difficulty of cracking a 50 character that could have been smaller. This is all assuming your using a password manager or something, as when you expect people to memorize passwords, there is a point where making it longer stops adding to security, and just makes people write it down somewhere, which actually reduces security."

Ironic that so many cryptographers have thick beards, isn't it? You wouldn't think they'd go for security by obscurity.   Then there's the one who replaces his lock daily to avoid key reuse.

You might also look into companies who build secure tokens or servers.   Another idea: Try looking at recent papers in a field that interests you and seeing if any of the authors are affiliated with a company. If so, send them an email a) asking them to clarify some non-obvious thing in the paper, b) if they had thought about some reasonably intelligent extension to it, and c) if their company was hiring or they knew of any other companies that were.

To elaborate on the previous comment the reason we haven't opened up the code yet is because it's pretty much a complete rewrite. We completely ported the assembly code that HEKTOR uses to be mostly C  for a different model of embedded processor. We chose to work with an ARM based CPU instead so we could port over port over parts of OpenSSL which will facilitate our public key feature.

Their products are closed source, so you won't notice the NSL forced backdoor being dropped in. Also don't log in with their mobile app or on the website, because that works differently to the desktop client and they can snoop your password in transit and it's available to them in server memory while you're logged in.

All you are doing is for quite literally no reason assuming this company has malicious intent. Companies cannot be legally compelled to add a backdoor. Lavabit held the keys, which mean just like gmail if they wanted to they could read emails, which is why they were susceptible to court order."
crypto,2vluf8,ManFromAnAntiqueLand,3,Thu Feb 12 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"Companies cannot be legally compelled to add a backdoor.   Yes. Yes they can. In fact, the mechanisms that break Lavabit exactly apply to Spideroak. A NSL is more than enough to require a company to provide ""technical assistance"" in performing an attack against a target, which includes sending targeted updates with modified version of their software.  A NSL says ""you're going to help us and you're not going to tell anyone"". The only limits are actual technical ones, not some sort of ""I don't wanna"" defense."
crypto,2vluf8,Chandon,-1,Thu Feb 12 18:27:25 2015 UTC,"Again, you are just making stuff up that sounds plausible to you. The claim that there is no limit on what a court can order you to do is to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the laws governing court orders laughable. Just stop.  Lavabit is exactly like gmail insofar as their access to your data. They just said ""unlike gmail we just won't look.""  To say that a court order that requires handing over data applies the same in a situation where a company holds the key and one where it doesnt is frankly laughable. That you won't even acknowledge the massive difference in those two things is telling.  This started off as a claim that lavabit didn't hold the keys and had been compelled to add a backdoor... That is only way they could give government access if they didn't hold keys.  Now the goal posts are trying to be moved, but even where they have been moved to is bullshit.  Technical assistance does not mean modifying a product to add a backdoor.  To whit, take a look at this, specifically page 4, which specifically says that reasonable technical assistance does not include helping law enforcement access encrypted data. They are only required to do what they can and provide the data to law enforcement.  http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1373063-apple-oakland.html#document/p1"
crypto,2vluf8,ManFromAnAntiqueLand,-2,Thu Feb 12 18:41:04 2015 UTC,"Lavabit did not hold the keys to the ciphertext (stored). They allowed one way to use them in which it was sent to the server temporarily for the session, to decrypt the data (IIRC - was they using javascript encryption instead?). A backdoor was forced to relay that key to the law enforcement.   I see no reason for why they couldn't force backdoors in updates of client side code."

His suggested solution was to modify the product so that only the users specified could be seen, but the government rejected that and then sought the ssl key which they got.

It was believed that possible threats, such as demands from the legal system to reveal the content of traffic through the system, were not imminent in Canada, unlike the United States, and that if data were to be handed over, encrypted messages would be available only in encrypted form.  Developments in November 2007 led to doubts among security-conscious users about Hushmail's security and concern over a backdoor. The issue originated with the non-Java version of the Hush system. It performed the encrypt and decrypt steps on Hush's servers and then used SSL to transmit the data to the user. The data is available as cleartext during this small window; the passphrase can be captured at this point, facilitating the decryption of all stored messages and future messages using this passphrase. Hushmail stated that the Java version is also vulnerable, in that they may be compelled to deliver a compromised java applet to a user.    Hushmail turned over cleartext copies of private email messages associated with several addresses at the request of law enforcement agencies under a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the United States.;  e.g. in the case of U.S. v. Tyler Stumbo.    In addition, the contents of emails between Hushmail addresses were analyzed, and 12 CDs were turned over to U.S. authorities. Hushmail privacy policy states that it logs IP addresses in order ""to analyze market trends, gather broad demographic information, and prevent abuse of our services.""

The FBI could add a machine to the Spideroak network that intercepted some requests to the update server, and have the court order Spideroak to give up their SSL authentication keys to allow the machine to spoof updates.

They could be ordered to hand over the keys because They held the keys. If you don't hold the keys, you can't be mandated to hand them over because you don't have them.  You go from that to ""then the government can just order them to add a backdoor,"" with nothing to substantiate that.  There is not a single example of that happening. Ever. Indeed, it isn't legally permissible. The technical assistance companies have to provide is in one instance limited to assistance installing the device, and in another instance limited to installation and operation. There is no law that allows the government to force a company to add a backdoor. There is a law that forces telecommunications companies to structure their networks so they are easily reliable, but those laws do not apply to IT companies.  Go read the court documents in the lavabit case like I have, and then come back here.  The idea that courts can order a company to do anything they want is just absurd.

crypto,2vluf8,Chandon,3,Thu Feb 12 18:59:37 2015 UTC,"Ladar Levison thought that it was beyond the pale for him to have to hand over his private SSL key. The court ordered him to.  A court case may turn on the minor technical distinction between law enforcement being allowed to add machines to a network to passively snoop versus adding machines to a network to forge responses. It's also possible that the court won't see the difference and will order whatever it takes to make the wiretap work.  It's even possible that the key to enable snooping and the key to enable update forgery are the same key. In that case, if the court orders turning the key over for snooping then law enforcement can use it for forgery.  We already know that the US government uses active attacks to enable interceptions in the form of various NSA methods, and that the FISA court has made no move to stop their use.  The real question is this: Do you want your security to hinge on a detail of legal interpretation, or do you want actual technical security?"

You can put the fingerprint or key id on your business card or email signature to make finding your authentic entry (and not someone prentending to be you) easier.  More commonly, people just post their keys on their website or share the public key via e-mail.  You don't need to trust a service. A website can do this encryption and decryption in-browser for the lazy. In fact, HTML5 even has a tag that generates an RSA keypair (and submits the public key as a form value if desired). The problem with PK is that people don't really ""get it"". I work in the security industry and even a large majority of my cohorts in the private sector don't bother to use PGP to encrypt e-mail attachments. Instead, resorting to Zip encryption or similar, which is many orders of magnitude less secure. It doesn't help that Symantec basically killed off PGP desktop, while making it virtually impossible to use as time went on, instead of improving it.  Of course, the scenario you suggest doesn't consider anonymity, so it's not very journalist-friendly. There are solutions for that, like TOR."

David Hulton's company, Pico Computing, specializes in building FPGA hardware for cryptography applications. They were able to build an FPGA box that implemented DES as a real pipeline, with one DES operation for each clock cycle. With 40 cores at 450mhz, that's 18 billion keys/second.

If I recall there was an attempt to put ""authorized domains"" into CA cert restrictions. I don't remember exactly why this was unworkable, I imagine it had to do with quickly becoming a management nightmare; how do you specify that ""GEO Trust Root CA"" (for example) is able to certify all the domains it already does indirectly?   I should be able to browse to eff.org, even if I don't trust its authority, because I don't care all that much.   I think a UX overhaul would go a long way towards this. (Actually, a UX overhaul on many strong security tools would go a long way, but that's another rant....) We should have 4 unambiguous security ""levels"", and none of them should have the word secure because that is way too ambiguous. Bare with me for the analogy; I think if we explain it this way, most people would get it.   Insecure: you are shouting in a bar to a waiter who is shouting to the kitchen. Expect to be ""overheard"" by every machine in ""earshot"". Some machine in the communication path (e.g.: the waiter) may play ""telephone"" and misrepresent what you say to the cook or what the cook says to you. Some machine in earshot or in the communication path is undoubtedly recording everything you say. Encrypted: your conversation is confidential to outsiders, but you might not be talking to who you think you are. Although no one can ""overhear"" your conversation, any machine in the communication path may still save or alter the conversation before relaying it. Encrypted and Authenticated by Someone: The world has decided to trust someone who says you are talking to who you think you are. Encrypted and Personally Authenticated: You have decided you can trust the owner of this cert or CA cert.   So far, in terms of UA visibility, all we have is #1 and #3. If clear indications of level #2 were prevalent we could HTTPS pretty much the entire web overnight, because #2 is fine for 90% of the web. But right now #2 is treated like #1 - this is a safe default, but it hinders widespread HTTPS adoption. #4 can be done right now with browser plugins or editing your machine databases directly, but it is a serious pain; and it conflates with #3 (unless you eject all 200-some default CAs from the trust store, but I think that #3 still has its place).  Easy to use facilities should exist to ""bless"" #2 or #3, promoting it to #4. It should go without saying that withdrawing the blessing should also be easy. (Demoting #3 to #2 should also be possible; perhaps we need a ""Compromised"" companion to Insecure....) Any facility for promotion or demotion should allow the user to add notes as to why. Conflicts should be readily visible; e.g. ""You've decided to trust Mybank's CA, and distrust Mybank's ROOT_CA because 'key was stolen'""; and the UI should allow an easy resolution of the conflict. For example, last time I heard about it, StartSSL refused to break with their policy, demanding a charge to revoke certs even after the news about heartbleed. I don't know how many people decided not to revoke their free certs, but it doesn't give me a warm fuzzy for the next year. (Come to think of it, we could have some sort of rules engine for power users to promote or demote automatically....)  In case you can't tell, I've been thinking about this a lot over the last month or so.  Unfortunately, I don't think this is really workable. For example, eff.org might be fine at #2 today, but if you want to donate regularly and save your credit card info with them, level #2 is wholly inappropriate. Unless we have some system to automatically categorize sites into requiring a certain security level. (You could trigger it once there's a form with a password-type input, but by the time that form shows up it's too late, you need to discard your previous history and cookies and javascript and reload....) I think however what I've outlined is at least a step forward, at the arguably significant cost of end-user complexity."

If you lose the key (and the revocation cert), you can still type in the printed copy by hand.  Expiration dates allow the owner to be lazy, by not properly protecting their keypair (including backups). Should they lose their key by not backing up their keys, it expires naturally on the server.  If you don't care about building a long term web  of trust with your key, and you don't mind telling people to always update their keyrings with you new keys, then expiration dates can be fine.

In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (or pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition. If the key is truly random, is at least as long as the plaintext, is never reused in whole or in part, and is kept completely secret, then the resulting ciphertext will be impossible to decrypt or break.    It has also been proven that any cipher with the perfect secrecy property must use keys with effectively the same requirements as OTP keys.  However, practical problems have prevented one-time pads from being widely used.

crypto,2v0hfm,TheTerrasque,1 point,Sun Feb 8 21:59:20 2015 UTC,"Security is less like a sliding scale, and more like a bunch of steps of different sizes. It's possible to have partial security, but some security guarantees are much more important than others.  If you physically deliver a paper copy of a letter a heavy envelope to a person you know, that's pretty close to 100% secure. Nobody read the letter, because you were watching the envelope in transit. They know it's you and you know it's them because you recognize each other.  If you communicate with a specific person by leaving a printed letter pinned on a public bulletin board, that's pretty close to 0% secure. Anyone can read the note, because it's posted in public. Anyone can change the note, because once you leave there's nothing stopping them. You don't know who read the note you posted, and the intended recipient doesn't know who posted the note they read.  Most communication methods are closer in security properties to the public note than the hand-delivered note. Something like mailing a letter or sending an email reduces the set of people who can read, change, or replace the note, but the reduction isn't even to a known, controlled set of people.  Another, very important consideration is from-nothing forgeries. If you receive a note from me somehow, how do you know I meant to send you a note at all?  So we have two sets of potential attackers:   People who are involved in note-delivery. This is an unknown, but bounded set of people who generally have some minimum level of expected trustworthyness. Anyone in the world. Some of these people are out to get you - even if just to steal $10 or your Team Fortress hats.   Encrypting a message in transit protects you from two attack by the first group - reading the message, or reading and altering the message.  Actually authenticating a message protects you from most attacks from the first group and all attacks from the second. The only category of attack it doesn't protect you from is some member of the first group reading your messages.  Authentication is much more important than encryption.  With authentication and encryption you're protected from any attack involving a false message being delivered and anyone reading the message. You're only left open to messages being dropped or delayed."

crypto,2v0hfm,TheTerrasque,1 point,Sat Feb 7 17:47:34 2015 UTC,"Encryption without authentication provides very little benefit, and almost all of that benefit can be gained simply by using TLS to do the point-to-point email transmission.  Let me repeat: There's almost no benefit to PGP encrypting an email without strong authentication compared to using TLS for the interconnects, which is supported by every email client and server and can be implemented without the user even noticing. Either approach eliminates basically the same attacks.  If we're going to bother the user with end-to-end encryption, it's only worth it if they can be sure the ends are who they think they are."
crypto,2v0hfm,Chandon,2,Sat Feb 7 18:21:43 2015 UTC,"A small point, the article talks about encryption with some level of authentication (involving ability to send email from account, and/or TOFU principles), with option to manually verify through a different channel.  But, to your statement. Unencrypted plus TLS leaves email readable at email provider, and you as a user have to trust all involved mail providers to keep to standards, and not intercept email. It will also be vulnerable if the attacker can MitM TLS connections. If you already have a local key for the recipient that's significantly harder to change / spoof.   If we're going to bother the user with end-to-end encryption, it's only worth it if they can be sure the ends are who they think they are.   To play the devil's advocate, that can in some situations be hard to verify even when meeting someone in person."
crypto,2v0hfm,TheTerrasque,3,Sat Feb 7 20:31:44 2015 UTC,"If the user understands the security model, TOFU is actually pretty good.  If the user doesn't understand it, they'll get signed email from ""yourboss@yourcompany.attacker.com"" requesting a copy of the secret business plan, see that it's signed, and happily send a signed and encrypted reply with the document attached.  That's worse than not having any crypto and following a ""don't send really secret documents by email because it's not secure"" policy.  The point of all these ""make crypto easy for everyone"" schemes that hand wave about authentication is to let people encrypt without having a sense for the security model. The user needs to know about authentication and know when they have it, or adding crypto probably just makes things less secure."

If it's 1, you invert the data bit (1 to 0 or 0 to 1). Then you move to the next data and password bits.   This is an xor operation. If your key is as long as your message, this is a one-time pad. If in addition to being as long as your message your key is: (1) sufficiently random and (2) only ever used once, this is uncrackable.  If you use a key shorter than your message, this is easily crackable.   So right of the bat I see this has the problem of creating a pattern with the lenght of the password, so instead of depending only on the PW bit, it can also depend on the last n bits of encrypted data.    A simple form of chaining.   Please note that doing this with xor as your ""block cipher"" like you suggest is a terrible idea.   Perhaps also devise a method for ignoring or jumping ahead on the password bits.   This is probably a really really bad key schedule.

A system may use security through obscurity as a defense in depth measure; while all known security vulnerabilities would be mitigated through other measures, public disclosure of products and versions in use makes them early targets for newly discovered vulnerabilities in those products and versions. An attacker's first step is usually information gathering; this step is delayed by security through obscurity.

crypto,2uz0ec,marklarledu,6,Fri Feb 6 10:13:05 2015 UTC,"AES is a secure block cipher. However, if the data you are looking to encrypt is more than one block after padding, then the block mode you choose becomes very important in that choosing the wrong mode could ""carry over properties from the plaintext"". For example, ECB mode will mimic plaintext patterns in the ciphertext. Other factors that highly affect the strength of the encryption are the randomness of the key, the appropriateness of the IV (if applicable to the mode), the implementation of the algorithm, etc."
crypto,2uz0ec,C_Hitchens_Ghost,3,Fri Feb 6 16:37:13 2015 UTC,You could argue that AES specifically has this problem in ECB mode. Modern cryptography uses an IV to prevent the same blocks from encrypting to the same output. You can think of it as a small key modifier that is changed every block.
crypto,2uz0ec,matthijsie2020,2,Fri Feb 6 16:33:27 2015 UTC,Padding would be mandatory in a scheme like this. AES is a blockcypher with padding so AES would be secure.

Say, for example, you have cards in a relational database - You take the rowid (Or whatever your flavor of database happens to use) for each card and shuffle that rather than plaintext that could reveal extra information about the card. Would this still reveal information? An improvement on the idea might be to create an ephemeral ID for each card that's only valid for one game (Of course, this is more overhead.) I suppose this doesn't get us away from the fact that we're encrypting known plaintext, but it does limit the amount of data that's useful to mount the attack."

However, some people might infer from this that verifying a digital signature is the equivalent of checking for backdoors, and that is just not true. While verifying the signature does provide a high degree of assurance that someone else hasn't tampered with the app, it doesn't mean that the app wasn't built with backdoors in the first place. Best would be to check the signature on the source code, inspect the source code, and then build from there (possibly doing the same thing to your compiler if you are ultra paranoid). I realize that not everyone is going to do that though."

How do you know that the developer of the app isn't an NSA front, who is knowingly signing code with an expertly hidden backdoor? Its a rabbit hole with no end. The reality is that unless your a high priority target, using SSL to download the app is enough.  Using email encryption without verifying identities is also not a big deal, as your probably not currently being targeted for a MTM attack. Now instead of having plain text emails all over, you have encrypted emails if anyone tries to access them later, or they get caught up in a dragnet of collection, which is really what most people have to worry about.  If you really think about it, trying to achieve perfect security would be a full time job if it could be done at all. Instead, just try reduce your exposure to untargeted dragnets."

Email encryption is a bit different. The likelyhood of getting a fake PGP key is incredibly small to the point of negligibility. The trouble is, if a e2e encryption scheme ever takes off, we don't want it to do so with people not understanding the need to authenticate. If everybody was using PGP, but no-one was authenticating keys, that would not be a much better that what we have now."

Without this step, we just take the website's word for it that this is legitimately their public key (or we rely on the fact that it was retrieved over TLS, but that's not quite good enough if you're worried about nation-state or other advanced targeted attacks).  It's possible he did this and just didn't make it clear in the article, or maybe Kleopatra covers this automagically when you do an import, I'm not familiar with it.

Until that point, this problem should be considered ""open"" and ""unsolved"".  For those not initiated, there is an extension to TLS called DANE. What DANE does is has a key installed in DNS records. This key is then used to verify that the certificate received from a server does belong to that domain without needing to trust a third party (sorta).  So the way this works is:   person wants to visit example.com browser goes off and does the DNS thing to resolve example.com to an IP and also finds a key along with the IP. browser does a handshake with the server behind the ip and they get a certificate. browser checks the cert with the key received from DNS.   So you may say, ""hey wait a second, isn't DNS completely fucked for security purposes?"" And I say ""Oh yes, please don't fucking trust DNS to properly secure your connections."" So then what is the point of DANE?  There is none if you go and use the current fucked up DNS, but if you instead use something like namecoin, which gives very strong guarantees that the the key does belong to the domain, then you are already way ahead of our current PKI, even if this solution does have obvious flaws (oh, and there are plenty...)."

The signature scheme is provably secure (that is, the scheme is existentially unforgeable under adaptive chosen-message attacks) assuming both the existence of random oracles and the intractability of the computational Diffie–Hellman problem.

crypto,2uldwb,Intrexa,4,Tue Feb 3 07:43:40 2015 UTC,"No, because as I'm cracking keys, at every new possible guess I still need to match against the same X keys. The birthday paradox comes from every additional birthday you add to the mix, it has more potential matches than the last one. For any given number of birthdays N, adding another birthday to the mix for a total of (N+1) birthdays, you have an additional N possible matches.  In the case of the keys, for X keys and Y guesses, you have (x * y) possible matches, making (y + 1) guesses only brings the number of matches to (x * (y + 1)), whereas if the birthday paradox applied, each additional guess would have to both increase the number of potential matches and the number of guesses."

(If you do check the inputs, you might run afoul of a patent....) A correct (and constant-time) implementation is tricky. (Timing side channel might not be applicable for your case; and using arbitrary inputs also might not be applicable to you. You'll have to evaluate that.)

So P-256 and P-XXX at its core is based off something called a generalized mersenne prime.  Mersennes are a very good way to find prime numbers algorithmically speaking.  The trouble with generalized mersenne primes in the elliptical curve sense is that the implementation is god damn awful to implement without coding timing attack vulnerabilities.     I know that P-256 is considered unsafe in some respects, but I don't know well enough if that would affect ECDH in the same was as ECDSA.    The timing attack works on the operations (addition and ""multiplication"") over the curve.  The prime number choice does impact this.  Especially so with generalized mersenne primes.  To make my answer short and sweet: if the implementation of addition and ""multiplication"" over P-### is not done in constant time, then you are vulnerable.  This is independent of which algorithm is used, ECDSA or ECDH (or any algorithm which performs addition or ""multiplication"" over P-###).   The project I am working with requires use of WebCrypto API, and only the P-### curves are available for use.

If this is a OTP code, then the first 5 characters identify the key in the field agent code book.

crypto,2tziwc,SpaceHeeder,7,Wed Jan 28 18:13:53 2015 UTC,"It's mostly used as an example of showing off how one would compute a somewhat complicated function using FHE.  AES has an algebraic structure that lends well to the operations found in HELib.  There are new things that could be done with FHE that couldn't be done before without additional interaction, which was one of the main selling points of FHE.  In practice, interaction is tolerable in many cases.  It opens up an easy path for low interaction and scenarios where you want to do things ""blindly"", like I ask you to sign my message with your secret key, but I don't want you to know what my message is, or I want you to encrypt something under your secret symmetric key, but I don't want you to know what my message is, etc."
crypto,2tziwc,DoWhile,7,Wed Jan 28 18:44:57 2015 UTC,"One of the coolest use-cases of homomorphic encryption that I've heard of is for search.  Basically it would be theoretically possible to encrypt a bunch of indexed internet information, then clients would send in encrypted requests that get processed on this large encrypted index that, let's say Google, has no idea what it contains anymore.  Your result is processed by their servers, and then sent back to you.  They never have the knowledge of what you searched, therefore they never have the ability to track you.  Another usage I've heard of is for encrypted cloud processing (think Amazon EC2 type stuff).  Your application sends an encrypted computation to ""the cloud"", and gets an encrypted result back that only you can read and Amazon has no idea what it was it just processed."

crypto,2tziwc,rflownn,2,Thu Jan 29 06:29:12 2015 UTC,"With respect to AES in particular the main advantage I see is the off-loading of work from a client onto the cloud.  Lets start with some basic assumptions:   AES encryption is computationallly fast, almost free, on modern systems. AES keys are much smaller than data users typically want to analyze Homomorphic computation is often sold as an off-loading of computation onto cloud infrastructure, sometimes for privacy preserving purposes among multiple parties. Homomorphic encryption is expensive Homomorphic ciphertexts are significantly larger than the plaintexts they represent.   The last two points are true to varying degrees depending on your scheme and parameters.  GIven all of this it suggests the best way for a client to provide an HE compute node with input would be to generate a new AES key, encrypt the private data with that key, encrypt the AES key with the FHE key, and send the FHE-encrypted AES key along with the AES encrypted data to the compute node.  In this manner our FHE ciphertext is limited to the size of the symmetric key and the majority of the data we wish to keep secret (and yet perform computations over) can be encrypted by good old cheap AES.  There is also bandwidth savings as we don't have the FHE ciphertext-blowup  over the entire input data.  All this said, what /u/DoWhile said is spot-on.  In FHE, and MPC in general, the benchmark of choice for years now has been AES.

A distributed, crypto secured public ledger is going to be the answer. But I'm curious why it would have to be a 'coin' based approach. There's a number of clear problems with a coin based approach when comparing identity to a currency. For one, each one of us has an almost infinite number of identities possible. If someone doesn't know your name, or you give them a different name, they might identify you by what you're wearing, how you look, how you sound. All of these are identities (that, presumably, would be of interest to someone if they were taking note). Identities are not scarce, and needn't be. Identities also aren't fungible. I can't send you half of my identity, and get something in return. Likewise, it makes no difference if there are 2, or 2 million, ""identities"" that purport to be theothercoolfish. If a knockoff were to engage in a contract with that identity (presumably signed by the wallet storing that identity) they'd be liable, not the unconnected other identities (or wallets). So is a coin approach really the best approach, or just a hack onto the existing blockchain? Wouldn't it be better to come up with an identity specific secure public ledger, designed from the ground up to be extremely fast, with minimal overhead, and attuned to specific identity issues that currency doesn't face?  (I understand that part of the coin approach is incentive - eg help secure the network, be rewarded in coins. But if you're a company or government, or an individual whose had their identity stolen, you don't need anymore incentive in securing identities. It's a fundamental requirement that's currently either externalized, and poorly, or handled, almost equally as poorly, in house)."
crypto,2tq27u,Natanael_L,1 point,Wed Jan 28 17:45:00 2015 UTC,"As you yourself said, having it be implemented in a blockchain with a native cryptocurrency simplifies the incentives for the miners in order to achieve a high level of security. It isn't necessary, but helpful.  Also, it helps proving you did indeed pay for the right to service by having both facts registered as entries in the same blockchain.   The other approach is a federated one like Ripple, which can be troublesome.   This could work nicely together with Namecoin as well, for example. You'd be able to delegate credentials to anybody with just their username, and what exactly your username IS matters less than 1) the fact that it is yours and 2) the credentials assigned to it.  My favorite future blockchain structure would be a Zero-knowledge proof checkpointed data structure with efficient lookups (the checkpoints would essentially be indexes proven correct with a ZKP) and the ability to register namespaces for arbitary data structures with arbitary predefined rules for determining validity (also proven with ZKP for the entries)."
crypto,2tq27u,theothercoolfish,1 point,Wed Jan 28 17:53:54 2015 UTC,"Hm, you're saying words some of which I understand. I'm not a crypto guy, sorry. :)   What I really mean to ask is - seeing how identity is completely different from currency, shouldn't it be possible to rethink a blockchain designed to handle it from the ground up? Where the people securing the network aren't doing it because they'll get coins, but because the data they are putting into it is important in and of itself?   To me, tying it to a currency has a number of problems. One, the cost for getting and maintaining an identity. Two, you get this speculative aspect to it. Three, people start thinking MTGox running around with their identities (go ahead and try to explain the difference between bitcoin and Bitcoin to someone. I'm sure you've been there.) Fourth - well, I've already stated how identities are completely different from currencies.   My question is, what would a blockchain look like that wasn't dealing with a scarce supply? (ie imagine an infinite amount of coins). Would this necessarily decrease the security of the public ledger (holding constant the number of participants)? Would a different approach have to be taken to verify messages/transactions written to the ledger?   edit - as for right to service - I must admit, I've hijacked this interesting thought experiment with a slight variation - in that I'm no longer imagining services tied to a particular anonymous user getting credentials through this service, but rather managing their identities on a public ledger. I view the chip in a human as a metaphor. We're born with a ""chip"" or identity. We carry that throughout our lives, interacting as that identity. It now interacts online. It can be duplicated (stolen). Is there a better way to manage that chip, our identity, with a public ledger? What would that look like, etc."
crypto,2tq27u,Natanael_L,1 point,Wed Jan 28 18:12:19 2015 UTC,"Similar things regarding the mining have been done before, but those systems aren't widely regarded as secure. That incentive isn't strong enough to keep it up.   What I mean with namespaces is technically more like named data structures with accompanying rules for how to make and modify entries. Bitcoin itself has one data structure, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency data structure with its rules for how to generate and transfer tokens in transactions. Namecoin has one unnamed data structure, the Namecoin cryptocurrency data structure, and multiple named data structures which you can make modifications to as a part of Namecoin currency transactions, including u/ for use names and basic profiles and d/ for domain names, with a common set of rules for how to update the entries in all of them.   What I imagine is a blockchain where your register data structures by name and declare a format for it and rules for how to update it. There would be a few predefined data structures like ""coin"" (replicating Bitcoin), ""DNS"" (which in turn replicates the functionality of Namecoin above with sub-namespaces for domain names, profiles, etc), ""timestamp"" for things that only need to have its hash registered, ""credentials"" to replicate the functionality of the Distributed Anonymous Credentials paper I linked above, and a few more like that.  For simplicity, a data structure could have a rule that says it is to be considered isolated, it can't reference other data structures. Others could allow you to reference data in any other data structures. Some could whitelist which data structures you can reference, and in some cases you would have a mutual whitelist or certain rules in between data structures of the same type (allowing you to for example make an atomic exchange between two altcoin data structures, such that either Alice gets 1 unit of altcoin 1 from Bob AND Bob gets 1 unit of altcoin 2 from Alice, or NEITHER transactions happens (both in full or none at all, this is what atomic transactions mean).  Then people could register other data structures with arbitary names and functionality. This could include altcoins on the same blockchain, things like Counterparty, an open online chess game data structure (yes, really), and much more. Every transaction would have a one or more atomic (complete in and of itself) instructions for how to modify one or more of the named data structures (an atomic instruction can only modify multiple data structures at once if they all allow that behavior, otherwise you need to split up that instruction in one per data structure to modify).  Every atomic instruction carries its own ZKP (Zero-knowledge proof of validity). Every transaction references which previous transactions it supercedes or appends to (if any) to allow more direct and simplified pruning. Not all data needs to be public and included in the blockchain thanks to the ZKP, you only need the hash of the instruction and data, those who need to interact with it then needs to figure out themselves how to access the raw data in order to create new valid transactions. This data could itself be public in the transaction that registers the named data structure, it could name a DHT key to ask for in order to find the data (this reduces the storage requirements for everybody).   Once in a while all data is indexed and a ZKP is generated of the index. All old superceded transactions are left out of the index as they aren't needed. All you need to store to verify the validity of ALL entries and all new transactions is the block headers (a few hundred bytes each) and the index with its ZKP."

My copy of the 3.10 and 3.18 trees don't even have a single call to the latter, either.  The user-facing /dev/{u,}random interfaces have always used the mixed pool, at least to the best of my code-archeological abilities.  Since the kernel already mixes the rdrand-generated data with other sources of entropy, I have yet to see a compelling reason to use a userspace daemon to do ... the same thing.  At this point, I would be more worried about userspace applications that try to ""out-smart"" the kernel, and use rdrand rather than reading /dev/urandom at all.

crypto,2t5b1q,NobleSir,17,Wed Jan 21 20:40:17 2015 UTC,"You'll never prove that the key pairs issued to you by banks do not have these type of markings. It's impossible to prove!   Strictly speaking, you wouldn't ""prove"" such a thing, but the idea behind it isn't true, either--points on an elliptic curve are not indistinguishable from uniform random, and neither are RSA moduli.   Well, and stop using RSA, if possible.   Once again, this isn't Curve25519 or RSA-specific.  Attacks like this exist for every cryptosystem."
crypto,2t5b1q,bren2010,4,Wed Jan 21 07:28:23 2015 UTC,"This article explicitly makes a point that RSA is weak due to this attack, which is one of the questions I asked the main author... whether he was trying to make that point.  You cannot let anyone generate a key for you in any cryptosystem.  Mostly due to RNG used.  Anyone includes closed source programs on your computer.  Some of the ways ECC could be attacked is instead of using a 256 bit entropy RNG seed, use 40 bits, multiply it by a 210 bit secret number and add 1 (or other secret 255 bit odd number) .  There is still an unlikely collision among keys, but you can brute force every key in a short time, or store all private public key pairs in 32tb for near instant access (32 tb sparse arrays let you just store the keys are used, and so take up much less space).  No need to embed anything in the public key.  Every 10m or so key generations, you can change the key encoding format as an excuse to change the addition factor from 1 to 3 ( or any other 255 bit addition secret factor).  No one can detect the backdoor unless they guess the 255 bit secret addition factor and then notice that multiple keys have gcd of (k - addfactor) = multfactor.  Whenever an authority is generating keys for clients, the simpler attack is just to copy the private key to a database."

Nonzero equations over the chosen field. Base points such that ""prime order ℓ"" and ℓ(x_1,y_1) = 0. The cost for the rho method to break ECDLP. Additive and multiplicative transfers for an elliptic-curve group of prime order ℓ over a prime field F_p.

At least ""somewhat rigid"" in that the curve generator does not give up control of which curves are generated. Must support the Montgomery Ladder. The cost for a combined twist attack must be above 2100. Must be complete single-scalar formulas and must be complete multi-scalar formulas.

Most people here will (pretty much baselessly) tell you that ECC feels more secure against future cryptanalysis developments than RSA (DLP) or Factoring schemes (includes RSA too).   One attack on ECC (ECDLP) can be translated into a DLP problem (of larger size equivalent to RSA), and so cryptanalysis developments on DLP would affect ECDLP too.  I'm more worried about ECC, because its newer, less intuitive, has a lot of salesmenship around it, and there is no provability for no non ECDLP attacks, and there may be incentives to hide attacks on the curves that are recommended.  While my suspicions over ECC are just as baseless as suspicions over DLP systems, an attack on 256 bit ECC is likely to break it (single PC), while an improvement on DLP attacks is likely to just cut a few centuries off the vulnerability of those systems.  The biggest problem with ECC though is birthday attack related.  All keys and signatures are from the same space, and it creates crowding, where every use is an attack on every other member.  Some systems aren't suited to this weakness even if 256 bits is considered adequate for most.  Alternatives to ECC have the advantage of doing straightforward encryptions and not just signatures as well."

If you can find that key (whether through mathematical approaches, brute force attacks or espionage), the whole system is retroactively compromised. That's not a system which I'd trust. Liken it to hashing passwords without salt.  The Nazis were lax on best practices with encryption and it likely lost them the war - not that I sympathise, but it's a good example of how easily encryption can screw up."

If you know this and have the Curve25519 private key, you can extract the encrypted blob, decrypt it, recover the seed and then generate the private part from there.  Specifically, it uses Curve25519 because it's cool and it uses ECC in general because it's so much smaller then RSA modulus that you can hide it in the larger RSA modulus.

The lower half of the bits of the resulting n will be scrambled, but the upper half will not change.

The way it chains the entire block could be used for an authenticated encryption scheme, where the first 128-bits are reserved for the authentication key, and would be compared to determine if it's valid (same data requirement with less computational overhead). Since changing any bit of the ciphertext would scramble the plaintext, it would be impossible to send arbitrary ciphertexts.  Additionally, differential cryptanalysis depends on control over the entire message block. When the message block contains 128 unknown bits outside the attacker's control, it should be impossible to conduct a differential attack."

Devised by Peter Gutmann and Colin Plumb and presented in the paper Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory in July 1996, it involved writing a series of 35 patterns over the region to be erased.  The selection of patterns assumes that the user does not know the encoding mechanism used by the drive, so it includes patterns designed specifically for three types of drives. A user who knows which type of encoding the drive uses can choose only those patterns intended for their drive. A drive with a different encoding mechanism would need different patterns.  Most of the patterns in the Gutmann method were designed for older MFM/RLL encoded disks. Gutmann has noted that more modern drives no longer use these older encoding techniques, making much of the method irrelevant. He describes the method's common implementations ""more as a kind of voodoo incantation to banish evil spirits than the result of a technical analysis of drive encoding techniques.""  Since about 2001, ATA IDE and SATA hard drive manufacturer designs include support for the “Secure Erase” standard, obviating the need to apply the Gutmann method when erasing an entire drive.

crypto,2sn2nt,rya_nc,14,Sat Jan 17 05:07:12 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how asymmetric cryptosystems work. You generate a keypair consisting of keys A and B. Whatever A encrypts, only B can decrypt; whatever B encrypts, only A can decrypt.  You pick one and label it ""private"", and protect it; and you label the other one public.  Encrypting a message with your private key means that anyone with your public key can decrypt it. Signature systems rely on this — they compute a digest of the message and encrypt that digest with your private key; if I have your public key, I can decrypt it.  Theoretically, encrypting a message with your private key is a signature, it's just not a very good idea to do signatures this way for various practical and attack-resistance reasons (e.g. you shouldn't encrypt long messages using asymmetric keys; PGP and similar systems generate a symmetric key, use that to encrypt the message, then encrypt that symmetric key using the recipients' public key(s))."
crypto,2sn2nt,0x6d1e,1 point,Fri Jan 16 16:50:03 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer, upvote.

crypto,2sn2nt,Os_agnostic,3,Fri Jan 16 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"It's not just speed. Because of RSA's design, it really isn't suitable to be used in a block-chaining mode like CBC.

(cf http://blogs.msdn.com/b/varun_sharma/archive/2007/11/27/block-ciphers-simple-attack-on-ecb-mode.aspx)  So even if you think the performance and data-size overhead of using RSA to encrypt long messages is ""worth it"", you shouldn't do it for security reasons."

While you could combine symmetric encryption with key exchange via ECDH that's not exactly what you asked.

crypto,2sn2nt,Vektorical,6,Fri Jan 16 17:38:54 2015 UTC,"It probably does depend on the cryptosystem, but take a look at RSA signing for example. It literally is encryption with your private key!

crypto,2sn2nt,trimeta,2,Fri Jan 16 16:40:08 2015 UTC,"Technically possible? Absolutely yes. This is functionally the same as signing, or perhaps a simplified version of signing: in normal signing, you hash the document, encrypt that with your private key, and include it with the plaintext source. To verify the document, the recipient applies the same hash function, decrypts the signature blob with your public key, and compares the two.  If you wanted, you could encrypt the whole document, but I'm not sure when that would be useful. There may or may not be existing software packages to do this."

In abstract terms, the encryption/decryption part of public key cryptography boils down to having a public key defining a function g acting on a set of encryptable messages M, and a private key defining a function f such that f ∘ g is the identity. This forces g to be injective and that the range of f contains the image of g. The range of f need not have anything to do with M though."

However, there are two reasons not to do so.  One is that it is slow, because public key/private key math is complicated/expensive.  The other reason it that it wouldn't provide confidentiality, because if you encrypted the same message twice an attacker would know that they are both the same.  A better way is to generate a random key and use it to encrypt your message (file, etc) with a fast stream cipher such as aes.  Then, you encrypt the key using the recipient(s) public key.  This is roughly how pgp and smime work.  If you want to encrypt the key using your private key, then anyone can decrypt it using your public key and be confident that it came from you."
crypto,2sn2nt,bitwiseshiftleft,1 point,Fri Jan 16 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"For RSA, the public and private keys are inverses of each other, so you could encrypt with the private key, and anyone with the public key could decrypt it.  This might not be as simple as swapping the key files, for two reasons:   The key files may have different formats. Usually public keys have a small e value, such as 3 or 17 or 65537.  Some implementations can't handle large e values.   This will be a secure as regular RSA against someone who doesn't have your public key if e is large and random and secret.  If e=65537, it might still be secure for one message, but don't bet on it.  If an attacker can see plaintext and ciphertext for multiple messages with e=65537, then he can probably break this using GCD, since he only needs to find N.  The same trick won't work for most other encryption algorithms.  For example, with ElGamal or elliptic curve systems, the public and private keys are different types of objects, eg a number vs an elliptic curve point.  So you can't decrypt using the public key.  You could still make a message which can only be decrypted by someone who has your public key, but you'd use something more boring, like hashing that public key and using the hash as an AES symmetric key.  You can do this for (EC)ElGamal because the public key is a function of the private key.  Several people in this thread are saying that signing is the same operation as decryption, or as ""encryption with the private key"".  This isn't true.  It's mostly true for RSA, but ""textbook"" RSA isn't secure and you need a padding scheme to fix that, and the padding is different for encryption vs signing.  It also isn't true for DSA or ECDSA, which are very different from encryption and decryption."

Can you describe a bit how that can happen?  Perhaps you mispoke as N is already known public key component.  Perhaps you are confusing with ECC weaknesses?  You are certainly supposed to be able to make multiple signatures with RSA.  The signatures in fact include the plaintext and the cyphertext."
crypto,2sn2nt,bitwiseshiftleft,2,Sun Jan 18 03:17:27 2015 UTC,"OP says ""encrypt ... so that anyone with the public key can read a message"".  This implies that someone without the public key cannot read the message, because otherwise it isn't really encryption, is it?  At least not the kind which belongs in this forum.  The question is about encryption, not about signing, though the system might effectively sign the message as well.  For an RSA private key, d is secret, large, and hard to find, and N is published in the public key so it's not secret.  The same could be true for the public key (with exponent called e and not d), but usually it isn't.  Something like 99.5% of observed TLS public keys have e=65537 (eg see Schaham-Heninger), though I don't know if that's true for PGP.  If your public key has this property, then N is the only part of it which could be a secret.  Again, this is different from ordinary RSA, where N is public and d is secret.  Anyway, suppose e is known to an attacker who sees two plaintext, ciphertext pairs (m1,c1),(m2,c2).  Then c1e = m1 mod N, and the same for c2,m2.  That means that N divides gcd(c1e -m1, c2e -m2).  Possibly some other factors divide that too, but probably not very many, and they probably aren't very big, so you can factor them out.  So unless I'm missing some sort of relation which hoses this attack, two known (plaintext,ciphertext) pairs would recover N, which breaks this system.  Once more, this is different from ordinary RSA, because we're assuming that e (corresponding to d in ordinary RSA) is known but N is secret instead of vice-versa."
crypto,2sn2nt,Godspiral,1 point,Sun Jan 18 07:10:07 2015 UTC,"I see how you are assuming it used.  You can't decrypt at all without N.  Though maybe e=3 could manageably find something.

Opportunities for kleptographic attacks are present everywhere random data is used.  All symmetric cryptosystems require random public nonces, so here's a simple idea for them:  When you contact your random input device, it could give you a public key encryption of x random bits and y bits to be leaked.  If the encryption function is pseudorandom (as many are), the tampered cryptosystem is poly-time indistinguishable from an un-tampered one, even with white-box knowledge of the backdoor (it's a strong SETUP).  There are more sophisticated methods for leaking the private keys from (EC)DSA signatures and (EC)DH key exchanges.  The private key for these backdoors can be split (or built) with a monotone span program, allowing arbitrary access structures to control application of the backdoor.  Similar to hierarchical encryption methods, corresponding public and private keys for smaller domains can be derived arbitrarily that only allow application of the backdoor in a specific domain--meaning that Tennessee judges need not have the ability to decrypt California's traffic, but the federal judges can decrypt both's.  Forward-secure encryption and standard PKI techniques can be used to minimize the damage of key compromise, although in a well-delegated system, anything significant would require a large number of people on a diverse variety of systems to be compromised simultaneously.

If you are encoding the same text under many different keys (birthday attack problem), then the 256 bit key doesn't give you any additional output entropy or collision avoidance.  If you in fact took care to use 2128 different 128 bit keys, you'd be assured of different encryptions.  You don't have that assurance with 2128 different 256 bit keys."

They are going to do something to allow them to read those messages. Would companies like whatsapp give the UK government private keys so they can decrypt the data.

crypto,2sf3rd,stratha,4,Wed Jan 14 22:53:58 2015 UTC,"There's a few things either going on here:  1) The NSA has very good strategic division of labour. Such that the mathematicians, analysts and lower level folk don't know the direction at the top level of the agency. They're also separated from the cryptanalyst team so they don't know the actual capabilities of the cryptanalysis. They're separated from the team developing the quantum computer so they don't know the brute force capability. They're separated from the hardware and datacenter teams so they don't know the scale and breadth of the system. They're separated from the malware and hacking team (TAO). They're separated from the few people assigned to infiltrate the standards committees and weaken encryption.  2) The NSA keeps a tight lockdown on what their staff are allowed to view on the wider internet, just like the US Army. Therefore they haven't read all the Snowden leaks so they still don't know what the agency is really up to. This rule is likely in place to prevent desertion, whistleblowers or mutiny. How does the saying go? Treated like a mushroom.  3) This guy is here to publish NSA propaganda and lies. The general gist of the post being ""Feel sorry for us"", ""We didn't mean to publish a bad standard"", ""We're just trying to protect the country"", ""We're good people really."" Which is lies when it comes down to it.  How else do you explain this Michael Wertheimer?   nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.html   Let's quote the relevant points which destroys his entire argument that the NSA is not trying to influence standards for the worse.   (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Insert vunerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, networks, and endpoint communications devices used by targets.  (TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Influence policies, standards and specification for commercial public key technologies.  (TS//SI//NF) The SIGINT Enabling Project actively engages the US and foreign IT industries to covertly influence and/or overtly leverage their commercial product's designs. These design changes make the systems in question exploitable through SIGINT collection (e.g., Endpoint, MidPoint, etc.) with foreknowledge of the modification. To the consumer and other adversaries, however, the systems' security remains intact.  (TS//SI//NF) Shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace to make it more tractable to advanced cryptanalytic capabilities being developed by NSA/CSS. [CPP_00090]   Words right out of the agency's mouth.  See those last NF listed ones? That means No Foreign. That means even the rest of the Five Eyes (GCHQ etc) don't even know what the NSA is really up to. Even they think the standards are secure. On one hand they tell the Five Eyes they're influencing standards for the better. Behind their backs they're messing with these commercial standards to make them amenable to their secret methods and cryptanalysis.  The other point we see here is that they tell the Five Eyes that they will insert vulnerabilities specifically only for targets. In their own private documentation we see that they want to do it worldwide and apply their techniques on everyone.  If you see any standard coming out of the NSA or NIST there is absolutely a way they can secretly crack it or exploit it in some way. If they release or approve a standard for everyone to use and say it's secure, there is no way you can really believe that, especially when they're secretly influencing standards, inserting vulnerabilities, collecting everything, storing everything and decrypting everything behind everyone's backs. Even without the Five Eyes partner's knowledge. It wouldn't surprise me if some of the Five Eyes agencies/governments adopted AES and were caught out because they didn't realise NSA wanted to keep tabs on them too."

For text that you know has a lot of e's or spaces, and probably at least one ' the ' or 'The ', or more useful, know some fixed part of the plaintext then you can attack the RNG to guess its output rather than the seed.  In the case of AES feedforward mode, as a black box, you can modify the decryption of the next block by choosing specific ""garbage"" in the previous block.  With a transposition stage, there are no useful known plaintext portions or patterns,  assuming that the total frequency of spaces or 'e's provides no useful information.   xor and aes don't react well to multiple applications of the encryption to sub encryptions.   for double xor (and I think aes as well)  B x T x A is equivalent to T x (A x B), where A and B are the pads used to xor.  If A and B are the same then you have actually decrypted plaintext by double xoring, you are xoring with 0.  With xor this is easily avoided by just having the seed initialize the RNG, and then getting A and B to be byte streams from that RNG, but doing this, even if you XOR 10000 times, it is still equivalent to XORing with a single random stream of bytes.  Just as SHA isn't designed to recursively be applied 1M times, the RNG might not be either, and 1M rng values can only help an attack as compared to 100 rng values.  AES (unmodified) as I understand it cannot be double applied (seed decrypts the 2nd time), and 3 applications is same as 1."

With a KDF, this should not be the case.  Also, there will always be an XOR key of length n that can turn an encrypted block of the same length, back into the plaintext. This is unavoidable. One must have a longer cipher than the input to get by this. However, determining that XOR key without knowing the plaintext, is generally faster, than some attack on the longer algorithm that enciphers a fixed block size.   With a transposition stage, there are no useful known plaintext portions or patterns, assuming that the total frequency of spaces or 'e's provides no useful information.   I've found several cyclic logical shifts (of an entire block, not the individual bytes) when combined with other primitives (xor, mod(add), subst., etc.) to be sufficient, though I expect a crack of my cipher. I think a good idea might be taking a block A at some offset < length(a), beginning the block cipher there, then only moving 1/2(length(a)) to the next block, effectively grabbing half of the encrypted block from before, and half of the unencrypted block, for the next block cipher round.

AES uses fixed 16 byte blocks.  I would guess that ""feedbacking"" any unencrypted portion of one block to another would make any attack on the feedbacking process easier.  To summarize AES, it takes 16 byte blocks and does transforms and transpositions within that 16 byte block.  Its not clear that after the xor and substitution steps, such that presumably all 16 byte values map to different 16 byte values (otherwise decryption would fail).  My rail fence cipher variation has the advantage of not requiring a blocksize, through something related to cache (such as 1024 bytes, or even 4k/8k) would make sense.

My example plain text: (Every # is 4 bytes)     #### #### #### ####  On the first round of AES, the first block: #### is encrypted to ABCD.  ABCD #### #### ####   On the next round, we modify the offset to be just after C, so the 2nd round of AES operates on the following block:  D ###, and let's say it becomes F 123.

Google's Keyczar had this problem.  Consider the following function in C:  int verify_mac(unsigned char *data, size_t len, const unsigned char *supplied_mac) {     unsigned char expected_mac[MAC_LEN];     hmac(expected_mac, key, data, len); /* write the calculated value to expected_mac */     return strncmp(expected_mac, supplied_mac, MAC_LEN) == 0; }   In addition to the timing issue, this one also has the issue where if you can get the right first byte followed by a zero byte, strncmp will exit early indicating the ""strings"" are the same.

crypto,2sbk0a,rya_nc,2,Tue Jan 13 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"The app wishing to authenticate does not need to know the MAC key. It authenticates to the server which returns a token with a MAC upon success. Any servers that need to verify this token will have the MAC key pre-shared with them. The client has no need to verify the MAC, nor can it be trusted to sign anything, so there's no need to use public key cryptography.  Basically, some mutually trusting group of servers want to know the answer the question ""did we say that"". Nobody else needs to be able to answer that."
crypto,2sbk0a,rya_nc,1 point,Tue Jan 13 21:12:59 2015 UTC,"Hm, ok, well if the authenticator is going to be directly involved in each authentication via the token then I guess a MAC would be sufficient, but in that case even simpler schemes seem possible. Like the authenticator could just generate random session IDs and keep a mapping of them to usernames internally (though I guess this has the downside of needing the authenticator to store more than a single private key).  My impression was that the idea was to give a user a token that they can use to authenticate themselves with other apps without needing to directly involve the authenticator on a per-authentication basis, but perhaps I misunderstood that."

With an HMAC session cookie this can be down without having to store any state server-side. Also helpful if there are load balancers involved.  In this configuration there is no central authenticator.  You seem to think they were talking about a kerberos-like system, which they weren't."

An attacker could forge (or modify) an ciphertext on the wire to elicit information from the receiver in unexpected ways. Similarly that's what is being discussed in that context re: error messages. Authentication is an additional layer of protection and if you're doing confidentiality -- you almost always want authentication, hence MACs. Similarly, a recipient of a ciphertext should always verify the authenticity of data before decryption (hence encrypt-then-MAC paradigm).

In the case of a compromised CA (allowing them to  mint certs for any domain) the cost of discovery is expensive: the entire CA is burned (c.f., DigiNotar). They're not going to use this tactic wholesale, as the risk of being caught carries too high a cost.  On the other hand, capturing certs for individual sites is necessarily more difficult because they must compromise every site they want to MITM. This is less expensive when they get caught, but way more expensive upfront.   Long story short, this sort of thing is only likely to happen against specific targets.

The Stored Communications Act (18 U.S.C. § 2709), Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1681u–1681v), and Right to Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C. § 3414), authorize the FBI to seek such information that is ""relevant"" to an authorized national security investigation. By law, NSLs can request only non-content information, for example, transactional records and phone numbers dialed.  NSLs may contain a nondisclosure provision—preventing the recipient of an NSL from disclosing that the FBI had requested the information—only if the Director of the FBI (or his designee) authorizes the nondisclosure requirement. The Director may authorize a nondisclosure requirement only after certifying ""that otherwise there may result a danger to the national security of the United States, interference with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interference with diplomatic relations, or danger to the life or physical safety of any person.""  Even then, the recipient of the NSL can still challenge the nondisclosure requirement in federal court.  The nondisclosure requirement was initially ruled to be unconstitutional as an infringement of free speech in the Doe v. Gonzales case, but that decision was later overturned in 2008 by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals after it held the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act gave the recipient of an NSL that included a nondisclosure provision the right to challenge the nondisclosure requirement in federal court. In March 2013, district court judge Susan Illston of Federal District Court in San Francisco struck down the law authorizing the FBI to issue NSLs, writing that the prohibition on disclosure of receipt of an NSL made the entire statute ""impermissibly overbroad"" under the First Amendment. Judge Illston then stayed her ruling to allow the United States Department of Justice to appeal the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit.

It just seems like a poorly thought out idea.  Your points:  I help run an IRC network. We blocked TOR because a massive wave of abuse over the years. I also block TOR senders with an RBL for e-mail servers. TOR is an anonymization tool. So, just like VPNs and proxies, can be investigated as part of a criminal case. But this only happens if criminality is suspected. It is not justification or primary evidence of a crime.  (Some) DVD ripping programs circumvent copyright protection mechanisms, which are not legal under the DMCA. So you're not correct about those programs designed to rip copy-protected discs being legal (in the US).  Torrents are not generally threatened. Copyright holders identify their materials being distributed online and send DMCA notices to the ISPs which forward them to their customers. Torrents are sometimes blocked by company policy for employees, perhaps unjustly, to curb illegal downloads. This negatively impacts legitimate torrent downloads, such as ISOs.

crypto,2s2rdq,gsuberland,2,Sun Jan 11 21:57:52 2015 UTC,"Almost unnoticeable.  On a mid-range CPU from the early 2000s you'd be likely to see something around 50-100MB/s throughput for encryption, which isn't bad considering that most consumer mechanical HDDs are barely pushing 140MB/s on sequential IO.  On anything modern with AES-NI support (Intel i3 and later) you're looking at 700MB/s or more, per thread, which is enough to keep up with even the fastest SSDs on SATA3. A top-end enterprise grade Xeon could blast its way through encrypting 8GB of data in under a second.  I have personally ran multiple layers of disk crypto (e.g. TC + BitLocker, or PGP FDE + LUKS) on modern laptops and servers with no noticeable hit.

I understand that adding encryption  would not hurt, but it doesn't really do anything of value, unless I am mistaken.

Unfortunately there's not a lot I can find on just MACing cookies without encrypting them (thanks apple for polluting my web searches :-/). OWASP has a ""drive by"" suggestion about using authenticated encryption only but is light on the justification. OWASP is however pretty respected.   Authenticated Encryption gives confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity (CIA); encryption alone just gives confidentiality. Encryption must always be combined with message integrity and authenticity protection. Otherwise the ciphertext may be vulnerable to manipulation causing changes to the underlying plaintext data, especially if it's being passed over untrusted channels (e.g. in an URL or cookie).   So if you must encrypt, follow OWASP's guide and use AES in GCM or CCM mode. I'm not sure which is better, I haven't looked into that in depth. Wikipedia has decent intro articles on those modes (GCM and CCM)  I believe if you have no need to keep the cookie contents secret, a plain HMAC should be sufficient."

crypto,2ry6np,d4rch0n,3,Mon Jan 12 01:22:57 2015 UTC,"AES cyphertext malleability is mentioned in the article/screenplay. If you have AES in CBC mode and you know part of the plaintext, you can do bad things and you might not know it was altered.  Let's say they know the first 8 bytes is their username, or guess that. They could even make a username specifically 8 bytes long to fit the 128 bit block size.  If you know that, and you have an encrypted AES-CBC message, you can alter your data by doing this:  you receive message with IV_orig and block_0, block_1, etc. you know block_0 is your username when decrypted IV_evil = username XOR username_evil XOR IV_orig drop in IV_evil in place of IV_orig, and now you have an encrypted message using the key they don't know,  but username is username_evil, whatever they want to make it to be when it decrypts.   And you STILL don't know the key! You don't even need it for this.  So, encryption with AES-CBC (and other modes... it becomes obvious if you look at the diagrams) is not alone enough to authenticate data, just because the server is the only guy with the key. You don't need the key to alter the data, just the plaintext.  If they argue that ""the user doesn't know the plaintext"", that's not enough to make a scheme secure. People can change data and look at the cyphertext and see where the stream changes and find out where the username is. You should always assume the attacker knows the scheme, just not the key (Kerkhoff's principle, in the sidebar).  You can do this with any block, not just the first block. The first block is easy because changing the IV doesn't affect anything except the IV and the block you want to change, but if you change a future block, you'll scramble the previous block. Instead of the IV, you mutate the previous block cyphertext which is XORd against the plaintext->cypher. So, previous block is jacked up but the block you want to change is whatever you want it to be (read on ""AES malleability"", ""cipher malleability"", ""known plaintext vulnerability"").  The best way to prove it is to demonstrate it. Not only is it impressive and will usually blow their mind (I've heard from the security team ""You're NOT supposed to be able to do that...""), but it is really fun and educational too."

crypto,2rrha6,Ahhmyface,3,Fri Jan 9 03:29:14 2015 UTC,"Your + notation is confusing me a bit.     The signature is not really additive, it must be an encryption of both the message and his public key. Otherwise he can decrypt it, remove his public key and then distribute. So he decrypts the entire message, then he uses your public key to decrypt a copy with the plaintext that also contains his public key. If he shares it, then he either shares the plaintext unverifiably, or he shares the encrypted version that displays his public key. This implementation is not quite as safe.  If he decrypts the message using his private key, and stores the output somewhere and then somebody else steals or eavesdrops the one-time decryption key, they can share your plaintext and basically frame the other user. By the same token, a malicious user can claim that somebody else did that to them.  It seems more prudent to just use the public key of the receiver.  Then at least your only excuse can be ""my private key was stolen""."
crypto,2rrha6,Ahhmyface,2,Thu Jan 8 23:08:54 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes by + I just meant ""and"", like a concatenation or something. So I think that your description for 1 is what I had in mind.  Your second point is an interesting angle, but I think It wouldn't work or I have misunderstood you. In implementation 2, the message itself cannot be decrypted with the recipients private key, only with the one time decryption key. If an attacker knows just the one-time key, he could decrypt the message, but not the (decryption key, signature, recipient pub key) tuple, so he could not prove the authenticity of the message. To do that he would also need the Private key of a recipient other than himself, which would make it as secure as solution 1. Unless I'm misunderstanding what you are saying."
crypto,2rrha6,Ahhmyface,1 point,Fri Jan 9 03:15:11 2015 UTC,"Well, a concatenation is exactly what you DON'T want to do. A ""signature"" is simply something that is encrypted with your private key (by with, I don't mean, concatenated, I mean your message is literally encrypted with the encryption scheme using your key as the encryption key).  You can't just concatenate a ""signature"".  I'm not sure if that's what you intend, but if it is then you need to encrypt the message with your private key to consider it signed. If the message and your signature are disjoint, then there's no authenticity.   I assume in 2 you were intending to publish the encrypted message and the one-time-key/signature/user's-key separately.  This is an interesting idea, but it has pitfalls. One, you're relying on transitive trust  (ie. the user that is providing you the one time key is the same as the user that decrypted the one time key with his private key).  Two, your proof of authenticity is not as strong.  How do you know the message is authentic? Well, it's not signed, directly. Though something that is signed happens to contain a key that decrypts it, which is a strong indication that you are the original publisher. I'm not sure how an attacker can exploit that, but it's non-standard.  Also, it's unnecessary. If you intend to ship a message to a single user, just use his public key. There's no need for the one time key.  This is all very confusing without diagrams and stuff so apologies if I am confusing/misunderstanding you."

Assuming that no one tricked me into signing a strange hash, it should suffice as a MAC, no?  Shipping the decryption key separately is pretty much a bandwidth and cup optimization. If the message is large, it has to be encrypted many times for each recipient (the context is a social network with status updates and pictures), which is cpu intensive and due to the size it takes more bandwidth.  Yeah it's hard to explain this stuff over text, im starting to think it would be more effective to discuss crypto over speech."
crypto,2rrha6,Godspiral,1 point,Fri Jan 9 21:24:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, that works for MAC, I am glad we sorted that out.  As for shipping the message separately with a one-time key, I am assuming you mean encrypt the message ""one-time"", and then distribute key/signatures as necessary.    That works good for a single user, but your efficiency savings come from distributing this same file to many users. Once multiple users have their keys, the transitive trust issue rears its head, the one time key can be stolen/shared and blame could be associated with the wrong user. Interesting, nonetheless.    I can think one more issue, and that is that since the purpose of this is to save encryption resources, then that means you're storing an encrypted copy laying around. This is dangerous because it makes the file is repeatable.  An eavesdropper might notice you sent the same file to many people.  They only need to find one with poor security to get the one time key. If you send a unique file to each user, it's much for difficult to figure it out what you're stealing in the first place. That is, of course, unless you're encrypting all file transfers, in which case, that sort of makes the one-time encryption moot.  May as well just use the public key of the user and then you don't have to have encrypt the session?  Some content is also traceable to me, whether or not I sign it. For example, this is supposed to be a social network. I assume this means pictures?

A screenprint of your facebook page is not necessarily proof that you authored it, but it will still convince many people.   Its also more damning if no one can look through your facebook page to see if there is any evidence that this is something you could say.  Its true that none of the systems I mentioned prevent that though.   If you don't send a customized encryption to each user though, then a leak of the symmetric decryption key, unlocks your past and future content to everyone that has that key.  (when you change the key, then you lock past content to anyone who did not remember the old key.  A one key per post system would solve this, just handle more requests.)   RSA 1024 does only 85kbps   the encrypt speed is the publisher's bottleneck.  It is 20x faster.  Latest software benchmarks has it 30x faster.  That hardware is 4 to 5 years old, and even low end new machines are more than 3x faster."
crypto,2rrha6,phyzome,1 point,Fri Jan 9 20:47:10 2015 UTC,"Yes you're right, but I don't think that this type of leak can ever be prevented. Unless... messages were sent as images with hidden watermarks in them? Then still someone could just convert it to plaintext and share it. Once they know the information it can be shared.  In my OP I describe that the symmetric key is used only once so your second point is not that helpful. A leak of the symmetric key would only expose one single message. Nothing past or future.  For the issue of needing to remember the keys, I see it the same as the issue of needing access to old data. If other nodes relay and store data for you, they could also store the accompanying encrypted keys.  For speed. I did read that RSA is normally used only to encrypt a fast symmetric key in a secure padding, so I guess for large files even with RSA it could be feasible to have fast transfers."

crypto,2ru2yr,SoCo_cpp,1 point,Fri Jan 9 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"Explain to me how a unique key, or set of keys, could unlock all AES encrypted data. Please provide proof of concept (yours or someone else's) that a backdoor key could even exist in symmetric encryption. I have not even seen an example of a weak/simple symmetric encryption algorithm that both worked and had a master key to unlock everything, that included multiple rounds (n>10) and magic numbers.  On top of that, after 45 years, there is no evidence the NSA tampered with DES. In fact, all historical evidence points to the fact the NSA strengthened the DES algorithm (the S-boxes).   On 17 March 1975, the proposed DES was published in the Federal Register. Public comments were requested, and in the following year two open workshops were held to discuss the proposed standard. There was some criticism from various parties, including from public-key cryptography pioneers Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie, citing a shortened key length and the mysterious ""S-boxes"" as evidence of improper interference from the NSA. The suspicion was that the algorithm had been covertly weakened by the intelligence agency so that they — but no-one else — could easily read encrypted messages. Alan Konheim (one of the designers of DES) commented, ""We sent the S-boxes off to Washington. They came back and were all different."" The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reviewed the NSA's actions to determine whether there had been any improper involvement. In the unclassified summary of their findings, published in 1978, the Committee wrote:  In 1973 NBS solicited private industry for a data encryption standard (DES). The first offerings were disappointing, so NSA began working on its own algorithm. Then Howard Rosenblum, deputy director for research and engineering, discovered that Walter Tuchman of IBM was working on a modification to Lucifer for general use. NSA gave Tuchman a clearance and brought him in to work jointly with the Agency on his Lucifer modification.""  NSA worked closely with IBM to strengthen the algorithm against all except brute force attacks and to strengthen substitution tables, called S-boxes. Conversely, NSA tried to convince IBM to reduce the length of the key from 64 to 48 bits. Ultimately they compromised on a 56-bit key.  Some of the suspicions about hidden weaknesses in the S-boxes were allayed in 1990, with the independent discovery and open publication by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir of differential cryptanalysis, a general method for breaking block ciphers. The S-boxes of DES were much more resistant to the attack than if they had been chosen at random, strongly suggesting that IBM knew about the technique in the 1970s. This was indeed the case; in 1994, Don Coppersmith published some of the original design criteria for the S-boxes.[9] According to Steven Levy, IBM Watson researchers discovered differential cryptanalytic attacks in 1974 and were asked by the NSA to keep the technique secret."

They've baked backdoors into hardware and Intel chips with TPM. They even joked about it in the leaked slides with ""TAO inside"" instead of ""Intel inside"" referencing their Tailored Access Organization. The NSA doesn't view it as counter-productive as long as they're the only ones that can access the backdoors. The cloud industry has taken a hit given the revelations, and Europeans have been reluctant to use U.S. based services, but overall the economy and technology industry is still chugging along just fine.

He needed a prime near that; 2255-19 is the closest available.  The choice of 486662 is a bit more technical, but also explained toward the end of the paper.  The smallest three integers satisfying the necessary constraints are 358990, 464586, and 486662.

The NIST curves are a pain to implement correctly and efficiently though, especially NIST P256.  DJB is right that more modern curve designs are better for this.  Curve25519 is a well-designed curve, and it has several solid implementations (most notably NaCl and AGL's ""donna"").  The software is very fast and very tight since both AGL and DJB are very capable and very careful engineers.  Curve25519 is not perfect.  In particular, a cofactor-4 curve with a 3-mod-4 prime is probably a little simpler, though these curves have disadvantages too.  Also, in a lot of the work I do -- mostly hardware security against physical attacks -- Curve25519 is marginally simpler/faster/safer but it's not as big a win as it is for software.  I supported Curve25519 for standardization as a new alternative to NIST P256, because it seems very solid, it has been received favorably by the security community, and it has fairly widely-deployed implementations on many platforms.

So they can't have a proper backdoor, the way Dual-EC-DRBG did, unless NSA can reverse the hash.  That is, if the NIST curves are weak then anyone can discover the attack.  But AFAIK, nobody on the outside can guess what such an attack would look like.  On the other hand, it's somewhat tricky to implement the NIST curves correctly, both because of the Weierstrass form and because of the primes (NIST P256 is especially ugly).

You should choose your encryption systems based on who you are trying to protect against.  If you are someone who is against the NSA in all forms and dedicate your life to getting rid of them in one way or another, using NIST curves (or any NSA sponsored system) is not the best idea.  On the other hand if you had reason to believe that DJB himself was trying to kill you and your family, then it might be smarter to use NIST curves over one that he came up with.  This is one of the reasons having multiple algorithms is a good idea. If we (as a community) decided to completely drop support for all NSA sponsored algorithms, then we are left with significantly less to choose from. And if there were a bug/backdoor/weakness found in one of those systems (or a class of systems) then it could hurt significantly more.  Furthermore, an often repeated mantra is that ""The best encryption is the one that you will use"". If you start using more ""exotic"" forms of encryption you will find that it is harder to use it (and much harder to get others to do so). Someone using RC4 all the time is magnitudes better than someone who turned off encryption entirely because the service they are trying to use only supports Curve25519 (In the name of security!) and their client doesn't."

I'm not comfortable with all of the keys and signature points all sharing the same space, and then there is:   Calculate s = k{-1} (z + r d_A) mod n  (wikipedia)   z r n and s is known.  and you get to see an r s and z with every signature. dA is a constant  z values that are close together even with separate k could leak info.   rdA would on average be 510 bits, but you know r each time.  If there is a leak of the log of this value possible, then many signatures could triangulate.  bigger issues would be whether gcd of all the signatures and subpoints that are generated all the time is possible, but at certain sizes birthday attack become an issue.  The field is so young too that few people have both the computer and math chops to think about it, and those that do, can be outside academia."
crypto,2roup0,Godspiral,8,Thu Jan 8 05:36:10 2015 UTC,"ECC has been around for about 30 years now, and has been carefully analyzed by many experts over those years, and its security properties are pretty well understood.  The space of attacks and defenses on everything you mentioned is pretty well mapped out:   You can divide an EC point by a number easily, but it's hard to divide by another point (aka discrete log). ECDSA falls apart rather quickly if the random number k is biased, but if it's not, then you definitely need a property of the curve and/or hash function to break it.  For the related Schnorr signature construction, you need both. Birthday attacks (eg, Pollard rho) are the most efficient known attacks on most ECC schemes.  The curves' sizes are chosen so that the birthday attack is appropriately hard.   The math behind the curves and constructions is actually pretty easy.  Not as easy as RSA, but anyone who knows college abstract algebra, number theory and statistics can learn it without much trouble.  The math behind attacks on ECC, and the analysis of why they're difficult, can be much harder.  But the same is definitely true of RSA.  You may understand how RSA works, but do you understand the number field sieve?  And those other algorithms which recently broke extension-field discrete log -- do you know how those work, and can you analyze whether they will lead to better attacks on RSA?"

I do a little bit to a medium amount to amazingly well depending on who you compare me to.  I understand it enough to make factoring schemes resistant to it.  For those people who understand it better than me, if there is a way to apply some of the factoring/dlp techniques to ECC, is there more money in selling ECC and staying quiet, or publishing academic papers disclosing those attacks.

ECDLP is a bit of a misnomer IMO in that on EC the operation you are trying to reverse is multiplicationi and not exponentiation.   Dude, I'm a cryptographer.  For a living.  My specialty is ECC.  Trust me, ECDLP is dividing one point by another point, not dividing a point by a number (the number is like an exponent).  Dividing a point by a number is done pretty often by fancy academic protocols.  (Eg, AugPAKE, though the security proof of that protocol is wrong.)  On a related note, you post here a lot, but you don't seem to actually understand crypto.  I recommend Dan Boneh's online class if you want to learn more.   I understand [NFS] enough to make factoring schemes resistant to it.   The only defense against GNFS is to make the key long enough.

That is not long enough to be completely patent free and not long enough to have all information about it as freely available as say Euler's formulas and proofs.   Most of the relevant patents have expired, at least if you're using prime fields and not GF( 2n ).  There are a few still held by Certicom on certain protocols, but the same can be true of RSA.  For example, I'm on a patent (I didn't choose to patent it, but y'know, job) covering a low-memory implementation of RSA with e=3.   I am comfortable with the integer proof in a field that square root is as difficult as factoring. For ECC, division by 2 is the equivalent attack and its not clear if that has been proven hard.   Division by 2 is not an attack.  EC protocols aren't the same as Rabin-Williams signatures.  Elliptic curve designs have a sanity check called the ""generic group model"", which models an attacker who just uses the group law, and doesn't discover some sort of advanced math to do stronger things.  EC hardness assumptions are sanity checked by proving security in the GGM.  Notice that you only used the group law in your ""division by 2 attack"", so a GGM proof would cover it."

Cryptanalysis and cryptography (in the non-breaky-stuff sense) are two different things, and are different from, say, netsec/infosec/systems.  I don't know that much about cryptanalysis and where one would go to find active researchers in the area, but based on what I've seen, I would emphasize a mathematical approach, but it's still considered a CS field so not having a CS major may hurt, especially considering many schools looks at your score on the CS Subject-GRE for the CS graduate program.  Double major in Math and CS if possible.  Spend the junior and senior summers doing undergraduate research if possible.  There are also many sub-disciplines within cryptanalysis, and they're all pretty neat.  There are ones that focus on breaking underlying mathematics, which is closer to computational number theory more than anything (factoring algorithms, etc). I would say the Europeans (and especially the French) and Japanese have a larger presence in this area, though the US also has some people looking into number theoretic breaks.  Others focus on breaking real-world things.  The Israelis (and Adi Shamir in particular) have some neat results in side-channeling hardware.  Poor implementation of crypto also resulted in many works breaking them, and these are mostly on the security side of things."

There is a possibility that some hash values are much more probably than others if they form universal cycle attractors.  Just because no one has openly looked for such values doesn't mean they don't exist or that no one knows about them.  If there is a list of 250 extremely likely repeated hash values for sha1, then that is a manageable list for someone with 2 slightly bigger computers than I have to crack many things.  One way to attack a pkdbf scheme is to precompute a table of 1m (or 10m) dictionary passwords to a specific scheme.  There is likely to be fewer than 1m cyclic hash values, but in addition, its an attack everything at once method that is quick to apply after tables are generated.  Its not as though fast sha hardware is out of reach for anyone big.

There is no guarantee that there is no h(x) = x, but there is also the issue of short ring cycles where h(h(h(x)))) = x (cycle of 3) that is also not part of the hash design.

Are you using SHA256(SHA256(input))[:2], or SHA256(SHA256(input)[:2])[:2] (where [:2] truncates to two bytes)? Because the latter is not how one repeats a hash and will obviously converge to a small number of circular patterns after a number of iterations, using the list of all possible inputs. The former is completely safe and won't give you significantly less entropy unless you start using a number of iterations closer to 2256 (which clearly, is impossible).   as for the J language, its at least writable as one liners.

After your first hash, inputs to future hashes are limited to 32 bytes + constant nonce if any.  The full hash will still converge to cycles, as it is not a design feature of sha to prevent such.  The issue has nothing to do with breaking sha for its reversibility.  Just that it is not a good RNG, even though it is used as if it were."

Now, as you probably know, one-in-2256 is almost exactly zero. This means that while there theoretically are circular chains in SHA256-space, they are almost all way too long to have any real effect. They are so long, in fact, that as you yourself admitted not even a single such chain is known to human kind. Now, a hash function only starts getting weaker (i.e. some output values become more common than others) once the number of iterations you are using starts to exceed the length of its chains. This is what you observed with your toy ""SHA16"" function. With actual SHA256, however, whether you use 15k or 15 billion iterations, it just won't be enough to make a difference. The most hash iterations I've ever seen in practice is in the tens of thousands, by the way.  Also, note that this is not a property specific to SHA256.

crypto,2r0rwc,Uncaffeinated,2,Fri Jan 2 13:38:22 2015 UTC,I think the difference is he's re-hashing the first two bytes only. Given the behavior that each time you rehash it doesn't get smaller proves that the 256-bit space doesn't collide to a smaller space.
crypto,2r0rwc,Thunder_Child,2,Thu Jan 1 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"The way he did it doesn't really prove much.  His pass 2 found about the same number of 2 byte prefixes with 50 rehashes as a single hash.  The exact number of collisions is random, and we wouldn't expect many after 50.  It also doesn't have time to hit a narrow cycle either."

Some versions are padded with an extra letter, but its still 216 inputs even with pad.  between each hash, I take the first 2 bytes of sha256 output , and if there was an initial pad, I add it to that as well.  So after the first pass, you necessarily have at most 216 unique values, and likely fewer due to collisions.  On the second pass you necessarily have at most the same as after the first, and again likely fewer due to collisions.  ie. if you hash 48k values, you can not possibly have more than 48k outputs.  Fewer due to collisions.  So if you write a sha16 and sha24 function, which is the cut off output of sha256, then that is the function you should be repeating.  Your code appears to do the cutoff after the repeated loop.  Its interesting though that your approach found 80 collisions on full sha256 between pass 3 and pass 4"

Of course there won't be any differences with a single hash if you just look at the first 2 bytes after 500 or 5000 full 32 byte hashes.  Its the same as 1.  You just needed to trim the hash inside the loop instead of at the end.  No idea why you chose not to.

You're describing an iterated hash, not a RNG based on a hash function.  You have insisted several times that iterated hashing is an RNG.  This is simply not the case.  Iterated hash is (one construction for) a Key Derivation Function (KDF); it may look very similar to certain RNG constructions, but it is not the same.  KDFs are intended to produce the same output given the same input; an RNG is not.  For an iterated hash you replace the ""seed"" at each step with the output of the previous step.  This makes the construction unsuitable as an RNG because (i) you leak information about the seed on every iteration; and (ii) each iteration raises the probability of a collision on account of the birthday paradox, which is what you are seeing in your experiment and claiming to be ""decreased entropy"" that results in a (short) cycle.  PBKDF2 is not made insecure by such ""decreased entropy"" because even at millions of iterations the probability of a collision is still extraordinarily low (4.8e29 iterations would have a 10e-18 probability of collision).  An RNG based on a hash is constructed using a hidden seed.  A simple construction could be for example: Output = HMAC-SHA-256(Seed, Counter += 1).  This is essentially a pseudorandom function operated in counter mode, which is provably unpredictable (given mild assumptions about the compression function of SHA-256 and assuming that the Seed is not revealed).  Truncate and collect the output of this function any way you want, run it through whatever statistical tests you want, and you will find no discernible patterns of lack of entropy.  A better construction would provide backtracking resistance, so that previous outputs cannot be reconstructed even if the seed is (subsequently) compromised.  For example: Output = HMAC-SHA-256(Seed, Counter += 1); Seed = HMAC-SHA-256(Seed, ""New Seed"" || Counter); (where '||' is string concatenation).  The seed is subject to a one-way transformation on every iteration.  I don't recommend any of these example constructions.  You can find proper Hash- and HMAC-based constructions in NIST SP800-90A."
crypto,2r0rwc,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jan 1 18:59:23 2015 UTC,"You have insisted several times that iterated hashing is an RNG   I may be using the wrong terminology then.  A software PRNG is not random.  It is a generator with a secret but deterministic output that looks random.  In the case of non crypto PRNGs the output is often reversible to get the seed, and this is easier if you are given the whole seed, which typical rng's try to avoid doing so as to increase security.  Repeated hashing is exactly the same in that it is also being used as a generator.  The full seed is given to the user, and the system relies on the hash function being irreversible for security.   4.8e29 iterations would have a 10e-18 probability of collision   The problem is not exactly one of collisions.  But of falling into a cycle that is 2n/2 long.  For sha1, 2~38 iterations would be enough to more likely place the hash into cycle than not, but 220 still places a real risk.  If in cycle, then there is a 240 attack to find it   HMAC-SHA-256(Seed, Counter += 1)   That would solve the cycle weakness well.  HMAC also reuses salt each time and so it also solves the dictionary password problem if there is a salt.  By using the Counter as part of the hash, you also gain entropy if the attacker does not know how many iterations you will do."

RNGs are chosen mathematically for long period, and are specifically designed to repeatedly use the last output of the generator as the next input.   No, all RNGs are not specifically designed in this manner.  Stateless RNGs  may be designed in this manner.  It should be self-evident that a stateless RNG cannot be cryptographically secure as it has no secret information, and while part of the output may be occluded (and kept as hidden state) you are necessarily leaking bits of the full state on every truncated output.  While it is technically true that one-way hash functions (like SHA) do not make any guarantees about not having short cycles when iterated, we have yet to see a single practical example or theoretical weakness that practically affects hash-based RNGs.    If you absolutely require a long-period generator with mathematical guarantees then use AES in counter mode (with a secret key/seed).  AES is a PRP so each output is pseudorandom, and is also unique if the input is unique.  You could go completely overboard by using the Mersenne Twister (with a different seed) to generate the counter, instead of using a simple incremental sequence.   The downside is that you lose backtracking resistance, which is an important requirement in most (probably all?) cryptographic applications.  Backtracking resistance requires a one-way transformation of (part of) the state; for this you could use a one-way hash (losing your mathematical guarantees and giving only probabilistic ones) or a mathematical one-way trapdoor function (like ECDLP) in which we have to trust that the choice of constants does not in fact have a trapdoor."

What specific tasks or concepts do you believe to be roadblocks? What specific evidence do you have for that belief? If you think it's a user interface issue, why are you defining new message delivery protocols rather than new user interfaces? What makes it impossible to put better user interfaces on existing protocols? What other, existing systems try to solve the same problems, and how do you do better than they do? Have you researched the existing systems? Can you explain, succinctly, why your system is significantly better than email with PGP, plus maybe OTR for instant messaging? Or than any of the other similar systems people have proposed? Have you actually tried similar or competing systems? Will you be enough better that a critical mass of people could possibly be convinced to switch from whatever they're using now? What's the value proposition, especially for an early adopter who might have to work to convince friends to switch, too? How will you market the system to achieve critical mass? Have there been past similar efforts that have failed? Why did they fail, and why will your system avoid that kind of failure? If you do succeed, will it be at the expense of the adoption of some system that solves more problems or does it better? Remember, people don't easily switch twice, nor do they easily switch away from systems all their contacts are already using. If you succeed partially, will you end up fragmenting the market, so that users either can't communicate with one another at all, or have to maintain accounts on many services (each with its own unique set of risks)? Who is your adversary? What are you protecting against? You explicitly declare ""those targeted by security services"" to be out of scope (yet you say that it's meant for ""those under the watch of oppressive regimes""). ""The privacy conscious"" isn't a meaningful category. And ""security services"" have often been known to target ""commercial secrets"". You need to describe your adversary model in technical terms, addressing expected capabilities, budget, time scales, legal and policy constraints, and so forth.   You really, really don't want to be dependent on DNS. You'd be better off just naming people using key hashes (before you say anything about ""ease of use"", consider that people had no problem with telephone numbers for decades).  If you use the DNS, you are automatically subject to attack by anybody who can bring legal pressure to bear on the DNS registrars or major server operators. DNS has already suffered legal attacks and is likely to suffer many more. It would be completely possible for an ""oppressive regime"" to prevent users in its territory from resolving any DNS name associated with your system. It might even be possible to get those names completely removed from the DNS, if your system doesn't have enough politically powerful friends in ""non-oppressive regimes"" to complain about it. Even the MPAA is trying to get the ability to do that.  Legal compulsion to keep logs is a certainty if there are large semi-central service providers (assuming your system becomes successful enough to be a serious annoyance to anybody). The days when you could rely on not keeping logs are basically over.  You don't define what a ""UID"" is (or really say anything much that I can see about name spaces). Whatever they are, using ""UIDs"" instead of usernames isn't effective. The adversary will just build a dossier based on the UID. One leak, ever, in the entire lifetime of the account, will be enough to tie that to the user's real name.  You say that you imagine that users might be able to run their own servers... but you clearly expect that most won't. What happens to my address when my service provider goes away?

How do you plan to assure code correctness? Will you be reviewing and/or testing the outside code you incorporate? How will you be testing your own code? Will you be doing static analysis?

I think I've covered all your questions, shout if not. This is way longer than I anticipated so I apologise in advance for typos and grammar mistakes. Bear in mind that what I'm proposing is still only in the 'thought experiment' / 'pet project' stage, I'm not claiming to have all the answers to every problem, nor do I have investors wanting to make this the next big thing. At the moment it is just me wanting to make something useful and learn something along the way. Whether it becomes anything more than that remains to be seen.    You don't really have enough of a technical description to make it possible to comment very much   More technical detail will come when I get around to it, I figured this was enough at the high level to start with as people could potentially dismiss the high level ideas before considering the technicalities. At the moment the sequence diagrams are high level representations of the data exchanges. Each of these will probably be implemented on top of HTTPS, but that is TBD.   Why do you think that you understand why ""the masses"" don't use existing crypto?    I did a bit of investigating before I started (although most of it is anecdotal) and I identified a few different reasons: * As you say, UI is a big part of it - I know my mother wouldn't go through the hassle of installing a browser plugin * Convenience - The majority of people are not going to go out of their way to encrypt their traffic unless they're getting it for 'free' (as in with no extra effort), it maddens me how many times I've heard ""I've got nothing to hide"". The plan is to make a webmail service sufficiently good that people will switch to it because they like it, not specifically because it is secure. (this of course is the hard part)  And now the reasons I personally don't like most of the offerings available: * If something is secure, I want the ability to verify it, or at least know that it can be independently verified by someone with more skill than myself - thus I want something open source * If something is using email as its backbone, then a certain amount of data is already leaking - the message metadata and the subject.   What other, existing systems try to solve the same problems, and how do you do better than they do?   Some examples (please let me know if I've missed any - specifically I'm looking at web based systems not plugins to browsers or email clients):  HushMail * Not open source, single implementation/deployment only * No IM support  SendInc * Uses links to communicate, I didn't try the plugin but presumably it'll follow the links for you. However all the information required to open the email is in that link, which is sent in PLAIN TEXT! Therefore I'm sceptical that the service does not have the ability to read the message if they had a reason to do so. * Send only, no inbox means the user still needs a regular email account * The user has the choice to use the plugin/service or their regular email, and thus differentiates between secure and insecure messages by having to make a concious choice between the two. This immediately draws attention to the secure messages making them more of a target. If you want a secure system, encrypt everything and the actual private content will be lost in the chaff of other encrypted messages. * Recipients are required to register with the service, it would be better if the sender could know beforehand which users will need to register. If I sent a message to my mother and she needed to register, she'd just call me and tell me she wasn't going to do that.  ProtonMail * They still fall back to sending links for sending outside their walls, can't sign up to investigate further * They are closed source, no way to verify implementation * Cannot spin up your own copy of their software on your own hardware * Invite only due to capacity problems * No IM support  Mailpile * Just a mail client, still relies on email under the hood (so still leaks metadata)  Tutanota * I REALLY like this one, but it is lacking some features (which I guess I could add myself...) * Only the CLIENT is open source, the server is not * No IM support * No multiple identities   What specific tasks or concepts do you believe to be roadblocks?   Specifically: * A secure email service that can run from a browser and requires no plugins * Open source client AND server * Abilities to have multiple identities from within the same account with different public keys * Non-reliance on email when NOT communicating with existing email addresses (so we don't leak metadata) * Should be a communications hub and include IM with the option to add social networking features at a later date (out of scope for the current spec) * Should clearly let the sender know whether their target account supports secure communication before sending, with option to import a PGP public key to send with (I noticed I didn't add that in the document)   If you think it's a user interface issue, why are you defining new message delivery protocols rather than new user interfaces? What makes it impossible to put better user interfaces on existing protocols? / Can you explain, succinctly, why your system is significantly better than email with PGP, plus maybe OTR for instant messaging?   E-mail is inherently 'leaky' - the sender, receiver, subject and other metadata are all sent in plain text even if PGP is used. I don't intend to invent new low level protocols, I intend instead to make use of existing ones in new ways. For example since the majority of internet users can access the web over HTTPS, data could be sent and received via this, and thus it would work with existing proxy infrastructure.   I do intend to use OTR for IM though, especially after the recent leaked documents imply that the NSA hasn't cracked this one yet.   Have you actually tried similar or competing systems?   Yes I've tried a few (see above)  EDIT: Missed a bit about missing technical information."

What's the value proposition, especially for an early adopter who might have to work to convince friends to switch, too?   That's to be determined, but I'm hoping that if the base code is strong enough then others will clone the software, run their own versions and feed the improvements back into the community (hence GPL). The value is that they can still use their account as a regular email account when communicating with other users outside of the secure network and they can forward their other email accounts into it. This is what I did when I switched to Gmail, I forwarded all my old accounts to this and it became my new 'hub'. I didn't ditch my old accounts.    How will you market the system to achieve critical mass?   I'm thinking that's a bit early at this stage, but the project would have at best limited resources. The best option would be a combination of social media and word of mouth.   Have there been past similar efforts that have failed? Why did they fail, and why will your system avoid that kind of failure?   I don't have much information on that other than the story about Lavabit. In this case the operator shut the site down rather than submit to FISA court pressure.   If you do succeed, will it be at the expense of the adoption of some system that solves more problems or does it better? Remember, people don't easily switch twice, nor do they easily switch away from systems all their contacts are already using.  I'm hoping the service created is as good as it can get at the time. The only way I think we can do 'better' is to do a bitcoin style system where there are no central servers. I did see a post about this on reddit in the last week, however if I remember it had some serious limitations. These tradeoffs were not something I could see myself compromising on, and therefore I doubt many less technical users would either.  If you succeed partially, will you end up fragmenting the market, so that users either can't communicate with one another at all, or have to maintain accounts on many services (each with its own unique set of risks)?   I think this is a risk any service must take when vying for market share. The service will support both regular unencrypted email and PGP-based secure email once a PGP key is imported, so users will not be 'cut off'. If more than one service got market share it would make sense to make the services compatible so that users can communicate cross-service in the most secure possible way.   Who is your adversary? What are you protecting against? You explicitly declare ""those targeted by security services"" to be out of scope (yet you say that it's meant for ""those under the watch of oppressive regimes"").

You need to describe your adversary model in technical terms, addressing expected capabilities, budget, time scales, legal and policy constraints, and so forth.   The main threats are warrantless mass surveillance and server data breaches (see Sony and the many many other cases of catastrophic leaks that are public). If a security agency wants your specific data, then they are going to get it - even if they have to physically plant a bug in your PC. What this project aims to do is stop them getting the data of ordinary people just 'because they can'. Stories like this, in fact I think it was that specific story that got me mulling the idea over.   You really, really don't want to be dependent on DNS.   In an ideal world, yes. But going to a completely decentralised system has a new set of problems and risks. I'm not smart enough to get around these problems - perhaps somebody else is - but remember this is only a thought experiment at the moment - something designed to expand my own knowledge, and hopefully that of others who have a similar interest.   You'd be better off just naming people using key hashes (before you say anything about ""ease of use"", consider that people had no problem with telephone numbers for decades).   I think people are quite comfortable with the concept of emails, and asking people to remember a cryptographic hash (bitcoin addresses are LONG) is pretty ludicrous. I guess you could use QR codes or something to transfer them but that in itself is a comatose technology that has limited value.

Legal compulsion to keep logs is a certainty if there are large semi-central service providers (assuming your system becomes successful enough to be a serious annoyance to anybody). The days when you could rely on not keeping logs are basically over.   I did think about ways you could minimize what sort of data could actually be logged. From the receiving end you'd be looking at the IPs of the sender (or the sender's server) and the receiver, and the origin server (but not user). So a hotmail server might know that user 1.2.3.4 sent an email via gmail.com, but it couldn't identify that bobbysmith@gmail.com was the sending address.   You don't define what a ""UID"" is (or really say anything much that I can see about name spaces). Whatever they are, using ""UIDs"" instead of usernames isn't effective. The adversary will just build a dossier based on the UID. One leak, ever, in the entire lifetime of the account, will be enough to tie that to the user's real name.   Sorry, that was something I began specifying but obviously got distracted on. However your comments made me think more about the problem. The original definition was just a unique ID for the user on that server, but you are absolutely right you gain almost nothing by using it, apart from to mask the target address from the sending server.   If you made the UID message specific it could not be cross referenced across messages from off the server. This would require a table on the receiving server connecting message IDs to user identities otherwise the value could not be reassociated. However, it might be better to do away with the concept of the UID entirely and instead just asymmetrically encrypt the receiving user with the receiving server's public key. This would allow the receiving user's identity from not being revealed to any intermediary message relays.  I also had the concept of using this to prevent identities from leaking out via group forwards. I am currently pondering whether this is a useful feature or not, and have at the moment removed it from the document.   You say that you imagine that users might be able to run their own servers... but you clearly expect that most won't. What happens to my address when my service provider goes away? Remember, your service providers are going to be under a lot more pressure than regular email service providers, and a user can't assume a service provider will be around.   Again I don't have an answer to this. To my knowledge only a decentralised system could prevent this being an issue (see above).   You seem to mix in assumptions about ""profiles"" and ""pages"" and social network stuff... but I thought this was a messaging system. What's in scope and what's out of scope?   Sorry that was a 'stub' for further investigation, but out of scope for any initial version of this project. It was just a high level idea on how such a system could be extended while I was brainstorming.   What about group communications?   CCs, BCCs etc would all be supported as normal, the message would be encrypted with every recipients public key in turn.  Group IMs are out of scope but could be achieved with OTR sessions between all participants.  EDIT: Fixed link"
crypto,2qy1be,Hizonner,1 point,Thu Jan 1 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"Part three:   In today's world, you have to address code quality from the beginning. It's no longer OK to just assume you can grab code from anywhere, or write code any old way. How do you plan to assure code correctness? Will you be reviewing and/or testing the outside code you incorporate? How will you be testing your own code? Will you be doing static analysis? What development processes will you use to keep the bug count down? Can you minimize the TCB? Can you design the system with quantified defense in depth, so that any breach in one component is known to be backstopped by some other component?   Absolutely, code quality is incredibly important. There are a couple of steps that can be taken to ensure high quality code, and for me these are pretty much standard practice.   Unit tests - for anything handling user data, especially crypto code then having a good unit test suite is critical. Code reviews - all code will be code reviewed, any crypto code will need to be further peer reviewed, this will be aided by being open source. Stable libraries - make use of stable libraries that are used by other software and keep up to date with versions when security issues are fixed Minimal surface area - the server side of the code will be as small as possible Encrypted data on servers - if all the data on the server is encrypted or hashed - even the usernames? Then even if the server is compromised, there should be no data to leak.   I do regularly run static analysis on my software, but I hadn't investigated the possibility of static analysis for PHP and JS - apparently they do exist.  I haven't come across defence in depth relative to software systems before other than having proactive server management teams - firewalls, IDS, antivirus, penetration testing, minimum functional server access, long unique passwords, etc. Is this a topic I need to read up on?   PHP has a horrible security reputation. Javascript is a dynamically typed language that gives you absolutely no help in writing correct code.   PHP is probably my least favourite programming language. I honestly can't think of any mainstream languages I like working with less. The majority of my code written professionally is C++ (performance critical code) and at home I dabble with C# and ASP.NET, which would be my preferred platform for this project. However, given that ASP.NET is closed source, requiring deployment on Windows servers that normally has much higher operating costs, I opted to forgo that preference in favour of an open source alternative that is commonly deployed - thus making the servers the software could be theoretically be deployed on even larger. I had originally intended the software to be runnable on shared hosting packages (hence PHP), but if you want to talk to regular email services you need SMTP, and the host will have a monopoly on those ports.  For JS I guess it would be possible to compile code to JS from some other language, for example Coffee script? However that just further obfuscates the code that the client executes. Javascript is not a great language but it is ubiquitous in browsers and pretty fast these days as it has been heavily optimised by the major browser vendors).  EDIT: typo"
crypto,2qy1be,Hizonner,3,Thu Jan 1 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"On naming:  Some of my points and some of your responses mentioned naming, but I don't think what we've written makes a central point clear.  Naming is the major technical issue in crypto and much of the rest of security. Everything else is straightforward. Knowing who you're actually dealing with, on the other hand, is nearly impossible. In particular, the issue is the binding between the name the user thinks in terms of and the keys and other data that actually control the delivery of the message.  Let's say you get a message, out of the blue, from ""mom@@momsprovider.com"". How do you know that it really comes from your mother? How do you know that replies will really go to her and only to her? Maybe her account is really ""mom@@someotherprovider.com"".  If you go to her provider and check her profile, it may say that she's ""Mary icStatic"" and her key fingerprint is ""/icStaticsMom2634+2ax36+/blargh""... but that's just the provider claiming that. And the provider is pretty easy to subvert, if you're an ""oppressive regime"". So are you going to call your mother and ask her to read you her key over the phone?  In reality, what you're probably going to do is to trust on first use. Based on the provider's assertions or whatever other information you have, you'll decide to believe that these really are your mother's address and key. You'll have your software make a note of that, and if the key changes, you'll presumably get a warning. So you'll limit your risk by only making that trust decision once, rather than trusting whatever the provider says for every single message.  But once you do that, you're keeping local metadata... and the ""real"" recipient of a message, under the covers, is the crypto key that can read that message.  This is why I tend to advocate for using key hashes directly as addresses. If you're going to be keeping metadata about name to key bindings anyway, you might as well keep it in the form of local nicknames defined by the local user. That means you can use a friendly, memorable name for each contact, one that reflects the context where you started to believe in that contact's identity. Somebody who introduces you can give you a hint about what name to use, but you don't have to accept that hint... and you can and should force the user to make an explicit choice: ""Do you, or do you not, want to call /icStaticsMom2634+2ax36+/blargh 'Mom'?"".  Where nicknames start to get hairy is in communities of interest, where you kind of want everybody to be able to refer to any other member of the community by the same well-known name. But in that case what you probably really want, in your heart of hearts, is to use community consenus, or a widely respected community authority, to decide who owns what name. And it's not clear that a messaging service provider is or should be a good community authority. AND you could actually even just put key hashes in message text and have the user's message viewer translate them to that user's nicknames for the key holders.  Key hashes are also great for building DHTs and getting you out of the DNS business, by the way.  One other thing about a different kind of name binding: I get a feeling you may be thinking you can trus t the public certificate authorities... that you can use ""https://www.foo.com"" and be sure you're talking to the real foo.com. That's totally not true if your adversaries are ""oppressive regimes"". Several of the CAs in the standard browser lists are operated by ""oppressive regimes"". Any major government and many minor ones can spoof HTTPS. The same goes for code signing using certs from those CAs.  Bottom line: naming is very hard. I think you should stay away from it as much as possible. Insofar as you have to have it, you should use as little of it as possible, and keep your naming authorities as local as possible."

Still not 'well' yet but I think I can cobble a reply together. I'll do the others when I get a chance too.   So are you going to call your mother and ask her to read you her key over the phone?   No, but you can get someone to describe a flag to you over the phone (or something similar). If you cast your mind back to the AACS debacle, people started coming up with ingenious ways to distribute the key, one of which was a flag in SVG format. Now if you used a similar format you no longer need the exact bits of the key to compare them, just a quick visual check 'red, green, light purple, grey', which can be compared over the phone. When you create an account your public key could have a flag associated with it, and every person's profile has a flag. When you first make contact with a person you grab their public key, and OOB confirm their public key.   In reality the 'flag' could be anything, you could convert the key into a short story (a set of templates with a series of blanks replaced with words based on the key) or a series of shapes/pictographs of various colours (blue square, red triangle, yellow fox, black hand). As long as it is something that can easily be transcribed by a human. If you wanted to go really basic you could even just pick a colour. so you might exchange 'b.charleston@@initech.com BLUE' with friends.  Are these things going to be fakeable? Yes, if you've got a lot of computing power to try lots of different hashes until you get one that resembles the original enough that people might be able to.  Do I even know if this is a good idea yet? I have no idea, I would need to try out a few variations and see how much data you can reliably store in them and have something still memorable, but it would get around people having to compare keys - not useful for exchanging names though.   If you're going to be keeping metadata about name to key bindings anyway, you might as well keep it in the form of local nicknames defined by the local user.    In an ideal world yes, but I don't think we're ready for that unfortunately. There are lots of real world examples where people exchange email addresses all the time (often erroneously, so people have to extrapolate) and exchanging keys is going to be even more problematic. At a recent meeting I went to people were writing their email addresses on a whiteboard to share with the group, with others swapping pieces of paper with email addresses scribbled on it.

No I'm well aware you can spoof HTTPS, even as recently as today there was the story of Gogo (inflight wifi) issuing fake Google certificates - presumably so they could cache content, but who knows what else they were doing or passing the data to. It's been going on in industry for years with enterprise inserting their cert in the keychain of their employees' computers so the browser just goes 'Okay, this Yahoo.com certificate signed by Initech looks legit'.

You can actually do pretty well just using a dictionary of say 8192 common words as your ""alphabet"".

I would still go with hashes, but I'm not saying I'm absolutely certain that's right.  If you must have global names, then I'd say you'd still be better off to avoid having them assigned by the service providers, or vouched for primarily by the service providers... or tied to the service providers at all if you can avoid it.  Alternatives:   Namecoin or something similar. Namecoin names may be FCFS and therefore potentially confusing, but DNS names are nearly FCFS and much more corruptible. Something along the lines of keybase.io ... but that may be too complicated for a lot of people. A simplified version of what keybase is doing, where you build trust in an identity by communicating with the user over a long period of time. But that amounts to aged nicknames, so maybe it doesn't really count as an ""alternative"". The existing PGP web of trust (and probably PGP keys themselves). But, honestly, I've been using PGP for almost 20 years, I move in very cryptoish circles, and keys still never seem to have the signatures I need, so I can't say I'm very bullish on it. It's possible it could be made better by making signing easier and fixing its very broken approach to transitive trust, though. Some combination."

crypto,2qy1be,Hizonner,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:59:47 2015 UTC,"Side discussion:  One thing that would be interesting to explore and something I haven't researched yet is if you used a decentralised model, but only between servers. So clients connect to their server using HTTPS (or if they want to, run the server software locally). Each client's server becomes a node in a decentralised network. Something like this: http://imgur.com/rt8yuoj  Some advantages: * If identity is managed in the distributed network, you could change 'providers' by changing your storage location and asking messages to be ultimately delivered to a different node. Ie one day you just say ""I'm with Hotmail now, so long Gmail"" and your key now points at the Hotmail server instead. This would mean any new messages get delivered there instead. * Identity is globally unique, and verifiable * Users could host their own node  Some disadvantages: * The database would contain all known, all valid addresses - a spammer's delight! I have no idea how you'd solve this.  I don't know enough about onion networks to know what this might look like, but the theory would be that a passage would be traversed between the source and target nodes with no intermediary ever knowing anything other than their input and output node, and never seeing more than a fraction of the original message.  However this sounds crazy complicated.  EDIT: Just saw your other message about FCFS of nicknames, okay yep global nicknames for keys are looking useless as well."
crypto,2qy1be,cunttard,2,Tue Jan 6 01:50:02 2015 UTC,"One thing that would be interesting to explore and something I haven't researched yet is if you used a decentralised model, but only between servers. So clients connect to their server using HTTPS (or if they want to, run the server software locally).   Why not just always run the server locally, then? What does the server role add to the architecture?   Some disadvantages: * The database would contain all known, all valid addresses - a spammer's delight! I have no idea how you'd solve this.   In a P2P distributed database, you can typically look up any key if you know that key. That doesn't imply that you can enumerate all the keys. You actually have to do extra work to add that enumeration feature.  Furthermore, since the first thing you do to look up a key is usually a one-way hash, and since data can easily be encrypted, even the node that stores the data for an address doesn't necessarily have to know what the address is.  I'm not an expert, but I believe real-world DHTs are indeed pretty complicated. The basic idea is pretty simple, but it gets tricky when you have to deal with things like nodes entering and leaving the network, nodes just plain dying, node A not being able to talk directly to node B because of NAT or firewalls or whatever, making sure things can't DoS the network or individual nodes in various ways, making sure that the Bad Guy can't easily arrange to be the storage location (or at least the only storage location) for targeted data, etc, etc, etc.  The good news is that there's existing code."
crypto,2qy1be,sarahjamielewis,1 point,Wed Jan 7 03:35:47 2015 UTC,"The intent behind the server model is that it would allow thin clients to connect, and storage to be localised rather than decentralised.   The alternative is that clients needs to manage the peer networks and storage itself. Not completely impossible I guess but you have to store your emails somewhere. You can't realistically store them as part of the peer network as the amount of data would be obscene. If someone for example sent a 1TB attachment those bytes need to be stored on multiple nodes somewhere for redundancy - potentially indefinitely - and thats a lot of bytes, especially on smaller devices or inside a web browser.  I'm going to have a good read up on distributed networks even if I decide to ditch the project though, it sounds really complicated and interesting."
crypto,2qy1be,autowikibot,2,Thu Jan 8 00:53:05 2015 UTC,"On software, where it comes from, how you can trust it, and the Web:   And now the reasons I personally don't like most of the offerings available: * If something is secure, I want the ability to verify it, or at least know that it can be independently verified by someone with more skill than myself - thus I want something open source *   That, together with the list of things you gave, shows an enormous gap in our mindsets, to the point where we could have, or could have had, real trouble communicating.  The open source part is obvious to me. But it would never have occurred to me to think for a second that you could do this with a fully Web-based system.   I know my mother wouldn't go through the hassle of installing a browser plugin   Unfortunately, locally installed security-specific software is a minimum requirement for any meaningful security. Given that you don't want to trust the server for data encryption, which is a pretty basic requirement, you CANNOT do this in a browser, using code downloaded from the service in a Web page. I'm not saying it's hard. I'm saying it's not possible, period. And service after service has failed by refusing to accept that truth.  The reason is pretty simple: even if the message encryption is end to end, the JavaScript code that does the encryption and decryption comes from the server, and the server can change that code at any time.  Is your mother going to notice that her service provider is now giving her an extra ten lines of code that send back copies of all her plaintext? She needs to know that she's running code that she, or multiple independent reviewers who she trusts, have actually verified. Or at least she has to know that the code can't change underneath her after she's made a trust decision. The code itself might be a plugin, it might be a standalone program, or it might be a change to the way browsers work. What it can't be is downloadable JavaScript in a browser that works like today's browsers.  If your mother isn't willing to take some steps to know she's running trustworthy code, she is going to be fully pwned, period, and there is nothing you can do to change that fact. You can follow in the footsteps of many, many existing services and give your mother a false sense of security, but you can't give her real security.  You might be able to change that if browsers had support for somehow telling the user that somehow-known-good code was no longer in use, but (1) they don't and (2) your mother is going to ignore the notification and/or click ""yes"" anyway. And if you're going to change the browser, why not just integrate PGP into it anyway?  Even Hush recognizes this, or at least they used to. I don't know if you still can, but you used to be able to use Hushmail with locally installed code.   The plan is to make a webmail service sufficiently good that people will switch to it because they like it, not specifically because it is secure.

Oh I absolutely recognise that the source from the server cannot be trusted (I even listed it in my list of 'client tampering methods').  My first plan was to use a model similar to how Tutanota does things - when you visit the page the first time you get a cached copy of the code using an Application Manifest. This allows you to grab an entire copy of the client up front, and then give the user the option to update later if they wish. You could potentially add code signature checks for any future downloads. I haven't tested this myself yet or figured out how resilient it will be in the real world, so it may not work at all though.  Further, like Tutanota you could make the web client available to build/run locally as an offline web site so that it connects to a target server and the copy of the code you have can be guaranteed to be the version you are running.  You've actually suggested yourself one of the other ideas I had - a micro-browser or HTML extension that performs code signature checks similar to how SSH does things (but obviously selling the latter to W3C is beyond the scope of this project, and then you get back to a wider discussion of do you trust $browser to not be bent to comply and silently accept certain additional secret signatories), but this breaks away from the completely 'web only' intent.   One of my original brainstorming ideas was to hash the client code against versions of the website on GitHub, but you would need one of the above methods to guarantee that your hashing/reporting code had not been tampered with. You might not even trust that specific deployment of the source code so this be useful to help counter that)  I pretty much left code modification/tampering as an open ended set of questions because I do not fully have an answer I can agree on yet. If as you say it does prove impossible (something I very rarely let myself use at the planning stage), then you are probably right - and I'll probably kill the project. I'd rather do nothing than develop a piece of security 'theatre'. I have killed MANY projects that haven't met my quality threshold.   your mother is going to ignore the notification and/or click ""yes"" anyway   Side note, I quite like how Chrome has implemented this feature, it gives you a 'take me to safety' option, and you only get to see the 'yes, really I want to continue' prompt if you dig deep.

As far as I can tell, you're not suggesting anything exotic like PIR or universal broadcast delivery (neither of which would seem very good for IM anyway), so the two seem absolutely equivalent to me.  In each case I'm just contacting a server and telling it ""put these data in this mailbox"". That discloses the recipient to the server.  In each case, the connection can be encrypted, so that at least in theory the disclosure is only to the server.  In each case, the sender name can be left out or embedded in the encrypted part... but in each case the server still sees the IP address of either the sender or some relay.  I don't understand what you think you're protecting here.

Nothing in the RFC 2822/5322 spec (to me) indicates the From field is optional,   You may not be able to leave it out, but you can put dummy information in it, and that's frequently done all over the Internet. As far as I know, no MTA checks to make sure that the header ""From:"" address actually exists, let alone that the message actually comes from that address. There are some antispam measures that try to check the source domain, but even for those you can perfectly well use the same actually valid address for every message from a given server, regardless of the real sender.  The envelope ""From"" address is a bigger concern, because that's where any bounces will go, and antispam stuff checks it even more closely than the headers. I guess you could use some kind of magic bounce dispatcher as the envelope sender, although that starts to sound like the kind of hack that could lead to sadness. If you gave up on bounces, you could still use a ""legitimate"" black hole address. Or even the null address, which is the addres that bounces themselves are supposed to come from and is therefore rarely blocked.   and I wasn't aware you could embed things like the subject and From field in the encrypted content.   In either PGP or S/MIME, you can embed a whole other email message, with its own headers. Some existing clients won't show it very prettily, but, hey, you're writing your own client, right?  There's an (expired) draft that both talks about existing S/MIME conventions and describes another way to do it. I haven't read it, but it's at https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cailleux-secure-headers-01 .  I'm don't know what current PGP practice is, but I strongly suspect there's a fairly well defined way to embed headers. Back in the 1990s, there used to be a convention where you'd flag them by starting the first line of the decrypted stuff with a double colon or some such hackery. I don't know how much it caught on or what's going on today, but again I really doubt there's nothing.   Sending server sees (in terms of what is available, not literally in this format): To: XXXXXX@gmail.com From: theuser@hotmail.com Subject: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  Receiving server sees: To: otheruser@gmail.com From: XXXXXX@hotmail.com Subject: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX   How does the receiving server send a bounce?  I have not looked at it at all or even read the article, this crossed my screen today, and it from the first few paragraphs it sounds a lot like what you suggest: Lavabit founder wants to make “dark” e-mail secure by default . The people involved sound like the right people.  But of course this is all serverful. If you were P2P, you'd insert the message into a DHT.

I only read the ""security"" page and did so somewhat quickly so take my advice with a grain of salt:   Master Key Encryption    The masterkey itself is encrypted using AES-CBC   CBC mode isn't the ideal mode to encrypt other keys. While some say it is overkill, I would prefer to see a mode like key wrap or key wrap with padding. Better yet, allow advanced users to customize this and default it to something like key wrap (with padding).   Master Key Derivation    a key derived from the user's password using PBKDF2 (HMAC-SHA1, variable iteration count, random salt)   I would prefer to see a memory intensive KDF like scrypt. If you want, you can first run it through PBKDF2 as described and then run the result of that through scrypt. Again, the ability to customize this would be awesome.   Password Authentication    But how do we know, the entered password is correct? ... we encrypt the password using the masterkey and store the resulting ciphertext.   If you encrypt the master key via an authenticated mode you don't need to do this (and I'd prefer it not be done). The wrap pad mode mentioned above provides some integrity protection (see sections 3 and 7 of the RFC) as do GCM and other modes.   File Content Encryption   The file content is encrypted with CTR mode which is good, but I don't see anything about integrity protection. If this tool is meant to be used as an encrypted volume where I can make changes on the fly then I understand and you can ignore this comment.   File and Directory Name Encryption    file and directory names are encrypted using AES-CBC with an empty initialization vector (all bytes zero)   CBC mode really shouldn't be used in a deterministic fashion as described. If you need a deterministic mode you should use one that is designed as such (e.g., wrap pad, SIV, etc.).  I'll try to read more into this later on when I have more time.

It is simply IV=MAC(k1,P) and  ENC(IV,k2,P) where k1 and k2 are distinct (for good crypto hygiene) and ENC Is IND-CPA secure. In more concrete terms: MAC can be instantiated as HMAC-SHA256 CMAC-AES and ENC as AES in CTR mode.  By simply using CTR mode and using a MAC for the IV, you've essentially using SIV.  The reason I suggested SIV mode is that you can get quick indexing by simply looking up the MAC of the plaintext (filename).  Edit: The RFC (and papers) call for CMAC-AES, not HMAC-SHA256."

crypto,2qqrvn,marklarledu,1 point,Tue Dec 30 18:45:32 2014 UTC,"Don't use weak algorithms. It is OK to use a partial hash as identifier as long as you have enough entropy left to ensure that filenames are unique (such as 80 bits of the hash, encoded as base64 in the filename)."
crypto,2qqrvn,cunttard,1 point,Tue Dec 30 20:37:25 2014 UTC,"Don't confuse filename encryption with IV generation. The filename is unique by nature, as plaintext filenames are guaranteed to be unique and the ciphered name depends deterministically on the plaintext one.  That the encrypted filename needs to be secure is obvious. But as there are no weak IVs in AES, a weak hash should be sufficient. Or am I mistaken here?"
crypto,2qqrvn,cunttard,2,Tue Dec 30 20:43:41 2014 UTC,"there are no weak IVs in AES   That depends on the mode chosen. For example, there are attacks on certain types of non-random IVs for CBC mode.

crypto,2qqrvn,marklarledu,0,Wed Dec 31 02:53:57 2014 UTC,"Ok, sounds simple :)  As IV depends on the plaintext, I still need to store it somewhere (e.g. prefix of encrypted file name). Using a random IV here would also work.  For clarification: Decrypting file names (directory listing) happens far more often than encrypting (create, rename). So decrypting needs to be efficient.  Edit: Just updated the file name encryption part. Using random IV instead of SIV due to simplicity~  Edit 2: Random IV does not work. I need a deterministic approach. Will give SIV a try now.  Edit 3: Don't know if my implementation is, strictly speaking, SIV. I believe that secure hash functions are not needed here (see my other comment).

AES in CBC/CTR mode require unpredictable IVs. What you have suggested is not.  What happens when you have two IVs whose absolute difference is small? If using AES in CTR mode you'll end up with overlap which is a basis for attack/cryptanalysis.  Also you're leaking information, since if I have a list of IVs I can dictionary attack (without a key) filenames by simply generating a list of CRCs for each filename.  Btw - if it wasn't obvious, I was recommending you store the IV along with the filename as part of the directory entry."

crypto,2qqrvn,Godspiral,1 point,Tue Dec 30 17:39:47 2014 UTC,"I guess I should justify my choices. I would use AES Wrap Pad because the wrap algorithms are designed for wrapping things like keys and passwords, it provides reasonable integrity protection, and the wrap pad variant allows for variable plaintext (i.e., key to be wrapped) lengths which makes it more ""future proof"". I would use AES in SIV mode for the directory/file names because it satisfies your deterministic requirements (I never verified whether or not you actually need that, I am taking your word on it) and provides good integrity protection.  At the end of the day, both wrap pad and SIV are deterministic and have decent integrity protection (the latter having better integrity protection). You can't really go wrong with either of them but you should know that key wrap comes with a bigger performance hit than some might realize. Not sure if this would be a serious issue to you or not.  Edit: Removed comment about SIV performance."

Result may be [subdir B, file C, file D] Step 2: Get the contents of file /A/D.  As WebDAV is a stateless protocol, during the request to /A/D no information about the previous access to /A is available.  The ciphertext names of the backing encrypted directory structure need to be derived (deterministically) from the plaintext name A as well as the plaintext name D now.  So when creating a file/directory and when accessing it, the ciphertexts must be the same."
crypto,2qqrvn,Natanael_L,1 point,Tue Dec 30 20:37:31 2014 UTC,I should as well. There was a recent discussion on keywrap algorithms on the cryptography mailing list where Matthew Green essentially said these are unauthored constructions (probably NSA) pushed via NIST. I would agree with the sentiments they're overengineered and come with no proof of security. SIV mode is dead simple and provides integrity protection by simply using a MAC.  Also I don't understand how SIV mode is slower than CBC mode with HMAC?

crypto,2qqrvn,marklarledu,0,Tue Dec 30 18:47:57 2014 UTC,"the issue has nothing to do with the security of 256bit aes vs 128 bit aes.

So the password expander (whether sha1 or sha512) doesn't matter in this security case.  The reason they are doing it 100k times is to make it purposefully slow, so that it takes 100k times longer to check all of the single character passwords.  If it takes 1 second per check (with 100k repetition) , then checking all characters takes 52 seconds.  But with sha256, what takes your computer 1 second to do 1 check, a mining rig can do 10 million or 10 billion in that same second.  PBKDF2 is only repeating a hash function x times.  It is not rocket science.  It is better than not repeating it for security against brute force, but the problem with using sha256, is that there is a lot of cheap hardware that is much faster than your computer is at it.  The hardware can further be considered almost free if when not trying to hack your password it is used to mine bitcoin/litecoin."

Ex1: No key stretching function applied  Password - 10 characters, character set 62, unpredictable.    Time to find - 2.6 months  Passphrase - 5 words, word list 10,000, unpredictable.  Time to find - 26 years  Ex2: PBKDF2 (100,000) applied  Password - 10 characters, character set 62, unpredictable.    Time to find - 22178 years  Passphrase - 5 words, word list 10,000, unpredictable.  Time to find - 2642482 years  That amount of extra work is about equal to 3 random characters to a password or 1 random word (rounding a good bit for the example).

It allows a quick prime search for user selected password, while being incredibly slow for many brute force seeds."

I personally like combining PBKDF2 and scrypt by using PBKDF2 first and then running the result through scrypt (using different salts for each) to help protect against a flaw (either theoretical or implementation) in one, but most people would probably think I am just paranoid.

crypto,2qqrvn,hrjet,1 point,Wed Dec 31 01:23:55 2014 UTC,Should have clarified: It is not SIV mode. Its just the idea behind SIV to create an IV by hashing the plaintext salted with a calculating a MAC using the plaintext and a key distinct from the masterkey.  The encryption itself is still CTR mode.
crypto,2qqrvn,RainbowNowOpen,1 point,Wed Dec 31 09:52:47 2014 UTC,"I really don't want to be that guy but I do need to say that people serious about their security are probably not going to use a tool that uses a mode that is like the idea of a mode that has research done on it, especially when you can just use the researched mode itself. Doing something like that would also cause suspicion on the general security hygiene of the whole project. Also, a couple things on what you said:   the idea behind SIV to create an IV by ... calculating a MAC using the plaintext   While I can see why one would say this about the mode, it is a very general statement and if followed by just doing something like IV = HMAC(plaintext, key1), it could lead to problems. There are reasons why the S2V part of SIV does what it does, and from reading your comment it sounds like you might have missed some of the important details.   The encryption itself is still CTR mode.   Do you do any post processing after CTR decryption to make sure the given IV is correct? If not, you could be forgoing some valuable integrity protection.  All in all, I would say use a mode that has lots of research on it, not one that kind of seems similar to a well researched one. In this case, I would say use the actual SIV mode as described in RFC 5297.  I hope none of this came across as mean, I'm only trying to help improve the final product :)."

If a user only checks integrity on their full files once a week, and meanwhile their applications are reading and writing parts of files without triggering any integrity checks from cryptomator... what's to stop the storage provider from manipulating your files, and then waiting for the user's regular applications to read the hacked data, and then save some tainted data back again, but now with the correct key?  That would pass the integrity check later, even though your files are changed!  Doing ciphertext immutability up front and for the entire system at all times is the only way."

Maybe if you talk about the file system related issues we can help come up with a different scheme that will work for you. If space for storing the IV is an issue, you can use a non-IV scheme like wrap pad (although the ciphertext ends up being longer than the plaintext in that mode so that might also be problematic for you)."

crypto,2qt80g,sashankdvk,2,Tue Dec 30 12:57:16 2014 UTC,"The measurement is ""bits of security"".  For instance, 2048-bit RSA has about 112 bits of security. 3DES (has a 168 bit key) has about 112 bits of security. Thus they are ""comparable"".  For a definition of bits of security, see section 5.6.1 (Comparable Algorithm Strengths) of NIST SP 800-57 Part 1:   Cryptographic algorithms provide different “strengths” of security, depending on the algorithm and the key size used. In this discussion, two algorithms are considered to be of comparable strength for the given key sizes (X and Y) if the amount of work needed to “break the algorithms” or determine the keys (with the given key sizes) is approximately the same using a given resource. The security strength of an algorithm for a given key size is traditionally described in terms of the amount of work it takes to try all keys for a symmetric algorithm with a key size of ""X"" that has no short cut attacks (i.e., the most efficient attack is to try all possible keys). In this case, the best attack is said to be the exhaustion attack. An algorithm that has a Y-bit key, but whose strength is comparable to an X-bit key of such a symmetric algorithm is said have a “security strength of X bits” or to provide “X bits of security”. Given a few plaintext blocks and corresponding cipher text, an algorithm that provides X bits of security would, on average, take 2X-1T units of time to attack, where T is the amount of time that is required to perform one encryption of a plaintext value and compare the result against the corresponding ciphertext value."
crypto,2qt80g,silverforest,1 point,Tue Dec 30 14:58:05 2014 UTC,Yes it entails determining the strength by its probability space and the complexity of the process in reduction of that.  By bits for example it measures the probabilities in unit bits that can be converted to other units of measure such as H. Further it is then fitted into system of equation that can be used for macro local contexts and params like time energy cost etc

That's layers upon layers of encryption and also an open source OS. I wonder if you remove one of the listed programs it becomes crackable for them again.

crypto,2qspj8,stratha,4,Tue Dec 30 07:47:01 2014 UTC,"The skein paper describes how to use it as a stream cipher on page 21.   To use Skein as a stream cipher, supply the key to the key input and the nonce (that selects the key stream to generate) to the nonce input. By convention, since the length of the desired key stream is not known in advance, set the output size in the configuration value (see Table 7) to 264 − 1. Implementations can then compute any part of the key stream as desired. For encryption and decryption, the key stream is XORed with the plaintext or ciphertext.  There is a fundamental difference between Skein-PRNG and using Skein as a stream cipher to generate random bits. The outputs of a PRNG are typically not reproducible. Skein-PRNG actually does work to ensure that once an output has been produced, the PRNG state no longer contains the necessary information to reconstruct the output. A stream cipher creates reproducible random data. Depending on the application, one or the other might be desirable.  An application that needs random access to a large random string can use the Skein stream cipher mode in two ways. It can use a single nonce and selectively generate output blocks, or it can include a counter in the nonce and generate a fixed size block for each nonce value. In general, we recommend the second approach as it does not require a new API for selectively generating parts of the output string, and thus is easier to implement using an existing Skein implementation."

crypto,2qtpa2,FakingItEveryDay,3,Tue Dec 30 16:39:30 2014 UTC,"Just to explain this situation a bit better (this may not apply to RAR, but it does to stuff like luks+dm-crypt):  The password a user enters to decrypt an encrypted file is not the actual key that is used in the decryption process. Usually, when the file is initially encrypted, the machine picks a key that is completely random and uses that key to encrypt the data.  This completely random key is then encrypted with yet another another key. The key encryption key is derived from the password the user enters. The algorithm used to derive this key is called either a KDF (key derivation function) or key stretching. What these algorithms do is take some input data, and forces the machine to do a lot of work to get some result.  Why do we want the machine to do a lot of work? Because if we are forced to do a lot of work, then so is an attacker. If we have to spend 2 seconds to get the result, then so does the attacker (the attacker might have a faster machine, but they still must expend a lot of resources.). 2 seconds may not sound like a lot of time, but when you consider how many combinations they must try, 2 seconds starts to seem like an eternity.  So far, this only explains that the password and the key to actually decrypt the data are not the same and are not at all related. As mentioned before, most modern algorithms have a special property which does not allow the key to be found is someone has the ciphertext and the plaintext.  However, some methods of encrypting data, particularly the one time pad (rarely if ever used in practice) are vulnerable to plain text key recovery. The one time pad works by doing the XOR binary operation with the data and some random data which is the key. If you look at the XOR truth table, you can clearly see that if you have any 2 of the 3 pieces of data (the key, the ciphertext or the plaintext) the third piece of data can be easily calculated."

For example, instead of just giving a MAC you may want to provide the MAC and the number of items in the list. If providing another value is not possible, you could do something like the following:   MAC each list entry XOR all the MACs from step 1 together MAC the number of items in the list using the output of step 2 as the key Provide the output of step 3 as the final MAC   Alternatively, you could do the following   MAC the number of items in the list with your key Using the output of step 1 as the key, MAC each entry in the list XOR each MAC value in step 2 together Provide the output of step 3 as the final MAC   Note: I have not done any type of research into the schemes above so I would definitely proceed with a high degree of caution if you are considering using something similar to what I described above.

One trivial example is how large composite numbers accumulate their prime factors, as it's currently impractical to factor a composite number, but relatively easy to find a product and check if a specific prime is one of the factors. New members may be added or subtracted to the set of factors simply by multiplying or factoring out the number respectively.

Quasi-commutative meaning that f(f(x, y1), y2) = f(f(x, y2), y1).  Since then, accumulators have been abstracted to be a set of algorithms that allow efficient and short witnesses of membership to a set in the same way that given a public key, a signature is a witness of membership to the set of signed messages.  The easiest-to-implement quasi-commutative hash function that I can think of is to choose a random modulus N=pq (RSA-style), and a random x as the empty accumulator.  To add a message to the accumulator, you output x' = xH(m), where H(m) is the hash of the message.  The function is clearly quasi-commutative and one-way under the strong RSA assumption.  Collision-resistance depends on the one-wayness and collision-resistance of the hash function."

You treat one of the individual hashes as a point on an elliptic curve. Doesn't matter which you begin with. Then you take that point and run EC multiply on it with one of the other hash values as the input. And you multiply in all of them. As long as all the inputs are the same, their order don't matter, the output will be the same.   This isn't much different from simple XOR the way you want to use it, other than that this is much much harder to tamper with. To get the same output, you simply MUST have an identical set of inputs, meaning you must either break the hash function itself or the elliptic curve itself.  Edit: as said in the reply, use a method that's secure with ECC to map the hash values to a point before you run EC multiply:   That also works if you can hash to the curve in an almost-random-oracle fashion.

But you can't use ghash to encode to the curve.  Proof sketch: if the hash function looks like a random oracle (perhaps with a distribution affected by some simple sampling algorithm), then the attack should still work if it returns ga hb for random a, b with rejection sampling.  In that case, finding a collision would find c = ga1 hb1 = ga2 hb2.  Then with high probability, a1 != a2 and b1 != b2 mod the large prime-order part of the ECC group.

If X = H(x_1) * H(x_2) * ... * H(x_n) * B, and X is published, how is it possible to determine a set of x that have the same output, given that if you knew the value of product(H(x_i)), you could determine the discrete log of X?"

But after the sale there is very little that is gained by having those documents safe from being decrypted - the action has been taken. And companies don't last forever, they fold or morph into different entities in which case there is nothing gained.  We could look at personal journals and such and make an argument that we would always want certain documents about ourselves encrypted. In which case there is nothing stopping us from re-evaluating our chosen crypto scheme every X-5 years and re-encrypting everything under a new scheme (most protocols already call for crypto-keys to be rotated regularly, thinking on a longer term it would make sense to re-evaluate schemes too - and this does indeed happen already).

For messages its another story, they regularly cross untrusted networks and may end up in the hands of an attacker.

If you had something that absolutely needed to be secure, why use the internet when you can spend the time to hand-deliver the documents?

Say you can harvest that thermal energy with some degree of efficiency.  Yeah.  I guess I take back a little what I just said : )  So you expend at least that much as heat, but then you can recollect some portion of that to reuse for calculation.

Post-quantum crypto helps us there. Note that it's not known or particularly believed that BQP contains NP, so this mostly affects asymmetric (public-key) algorithms, not symmetric ones. Physical capabilities of brute force. Fortunately, key lengths and security levels are an exponential measure, so even if a 56 or 128-bit security level is theoretically brute-forceable, it's quite possible that 256 or 512 bits exceeds the physical limit on the amount of brute-forcing you can do given all the energy and matter in this universe. Schneier has an analysis using Boltzmann's constant where he calculates that the entire power output of our sun would take 32 years to merely count from 0 to 2192 in a thermodynamically-optimal register. ""These numbers ... strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space."" Algorithmic breaks. There's no great answer here, given how young the field is and the lack of proof of P≠NP. Block ciphers, in particular, tend to be pretty ad-hoc, and there isn't a lot of work (that I've seen) on provably secure block ciphers. There's no proof that says that, e.g., AES is secure if DLP is hard. The best approach I've seen is something like Keybase's Triplesec, which uses three block ciphers of three different designs and authorship (plus scrypt and HMAC), as a way to hedge bets.

Forward secrecy means that there is no single key that, if compromised, can retroactively decrypt all past conversation. For instance, a protocol that gives one party a certificate and has the other party encrypt data to their public key is not forward-secret. A protocol that has two parties establish a shared secret (e.g. via Diffie-Hellman) and has one party sign a function of the shared secret is forward-secret, because if the signing key gets compromised, that doesn't let you attack past conversations.  But there still is an attackable key in that conversation, namely the DH shared secret. It's just different for every conversation. An attacker with the ability to attack the cipher (either by brute force, or by particularly bad sorts of cryptographic weakness) can just try to figure out the session key. The long-term key doesn't help the attacker, by design, but the session key definitely does.  The use case for forward secrecy is that a long-term key is inherently risky. You can have your hard drive stolen, you can be rooted or Heartbled, etc. The session key is only in memory, and all storage of the session key is destroyed at the end of the conversation.

As memory in most commercial systems is a shared RAM  across all processes protected only by software kernel, and some 'hardware' interfaces it leaves it open to attack, making software based FDE a risk of making data irrecoverable just by encryption.  i.e. If I have a chain block of data being put into submission for encryption, then an attacker can manipulate just one bit at  the start and render that block chain's data completely irrecoverable.  As for Hardware FDE, the bonus is that this doesn't occur. An attacker doesn't have access to the process as it is isolated. The encryption routine, usually including a dedicated AES, also is much, much faster since the chip utilizes encryption along with its block layout. The drawback is that the encryption routine, even if known, is still a blackbox. The implementation is unknown.   edit: Woops, got mixed up a bit thinking of different memory architectures and dedicated data transmission buses. An attacker can still mess up data on the FDE on a shared memory bus by manipulating just one bit just before submission. This can be done through other hardware, software and exploiting timing inconsistencies (i.e. bugs) in other software/drivers on the system. For example, an attack can exploit timing on the data bus line through a faulty device. An example of a remote attack would be an attacker exploits a faulty or exploited wifi or ethernet device to begin randomly thrashing the data bus during transmission. Considering today's state of affairs in the US, this can be a very likely scenario especially for FDEs implemented on cell phones.  Also data recovery on FDE can be more difficult, depending on the implementation, and much more costly. Due to the black box implementation, there's still no guarantee of the encryption routine used on the data. On OSS software, there is guarantee of how the data was encrypted, making it still recoverable in some parts.  Other issues off the top of my head is flushing. On software based encryption systems, flushing to disk is different than hardware FDE. This may or may not be a problem, but it does create a 'lag' between updates to disk creating a new attack vector. For hardware FDE, there is much less lag."

Even given a large number of samples from an unknown distribution, there's no general way of estimating the entropy of that distribution.   For example, suppose I give you several gigabytes worth of  ciphertext obtained by using CBC-AES-128; unless you break AES, there's no computationally feasible way to distinguish this from random data, even if you know the plaintext. However, the ciphertext contains only 128 bits of entropy, whereas the same amount of uniformly random would contain several gigabytes of entropy.  The bottom line is that you'd need to estimate the entropy of your inputs using a physical model of the process used to generate them.  Also, minimum entropy is usually a more useful measure than Shannon entropy in the context of cryptography. If the topic of extracting (close to) uniform random bits from imperfect sources is something that interests you, you should read up on the leftover hash lemma and randomness extraction. Just be warned that this rabbit hole goes deep and is full of math.  That being said, hashing high-entropy data is usually enough (but your intuition that you won't magically get more entropy than you started with is dead on). I would be concerned with only using public sources of entropy however...  edit: the link you posted shows how to compute the Shannon entropy of a bytestream, but it assumes that bytestream completely describes the  distribution, and doesn't reveal higher-order statistics, such as correlations between consecutive bytes.

Very tiny, unmeasurable variations in the voltage, and the construct of element creates chaotic process that is result of many numerous tiny unpredictable processes that results in the occurence of a random event, in this case a voltage that is then measured. The unpredictability of the tiny processes results in the unpredictability of the macro chaotic process resulting in the unpredictable occurence of a voltage spike. One example of entropy in this case can be measured as, ""How many of the tiny processes are necessary to correctly predict the macro process resulting in the occurence of the voltage spike?""   Another process is to measure the brownian motion of a tiny speckle on some liquid surface through a measurement device. The very tiny processes numbering in unknowns across all interacting atomic elements makes this tiny speckle move in unpredictable way given our knowledge and tools. One example is to measure if speckle move left or right meaning 1 or 0.  Another example to collect entropy is like so. Say I have a thermometer outside of my window. The 'distribution' is the expected temperature and its expected known, measurable and predictable variation across some time t. Lets say we identify a time 'qt' such that the changes in temperature occuring within that time are unpredictable no matter how many known processes we account for. Here we use a known distribution, i.e. the expected predictable and measurable temperature across some time 't', to identify 'entropy' in the time 'qt' as the unpredictable variation within time 'qt'."

Now the GCD itself will run in approximately linear in the number of digits of the smaller number (~1024 iterations) being overwhelmed by the first modular division of the product versus the RSA key, which would work out to be proportional to the size of the product in digits (analysis of the GCD traditionally adopts a uniform cost model where the costs of intermediate mathematical operators are approximately constant).  This would mean that it would in fact take approximate time linear in the number of digits of the product, which itself is exponential in the number of digits in the key you would want to factor.

Good question:  Aes is generally felt to have a weaker key-schedule, such that the transition between mappings is not as ... deterministically nondeterministic as should be, in this the entropy is weakened as the multiple rounds do not add entropy in a linear fashion, the marginal entropy added is reduced for every round.  It is exploitable, just very very hard to (though many of the best attacks on aes-128 use this, and I think Schneier himself did a paper on it).

The prime number theorem gives a general description of how the primes are distributed among the positive integers. It formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger.  Informally speaking, the prime number theorem states that if a random integer is selected in the range of zero to some large integer N, the probability that the selected integer is prime is about 1 / ln(N), where ln(N) is the natural logarithm of N. Consequently, a random integer with at most 2n digits (for large enough n) is about half as likely to be prime as a random integer with at most n digits. For example, among the positive integers of at most 1000 digits, about one in 2300 is prime (ln 101000 ≈ 2302.6), whereas among positive integers of at most 2000 digits, about one in 4600 is prime (ln 102000 ≈ 4605.2). In other words, the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first N integers is roughly ln(N).

It's like asking ""If I had all the numbers, would addition be any easier or harder?""  The answer is that the question is somewhat irrelevant, because after a certain point you stop adding 13+11 by putting your finger on 13 and counting up 11 spots -- you use a method of addition that adds by the ones place, then the tens place, and so on.  Factorization via sieveing was popular for maybe a thousand years, and that was then followed by a shocking sequence of discoveries in the past few centuries.  Take Fermat factoring  for example, which doesn't make use of primes, but rather, square numbers to tease out a factor.  Modern methods extend this even further.  Finally, the usefulness of primes in cryptography isn't just in factoring.  Primes give rise to algebraic structures which are useful, such as  groups with nice structure, fields and more.  These are due to the intricate importance of primes in abstract algebra and number theory, and leveraging those for security.

crypto,2qbor9,rosulek,7,Thu Dec 25 05:27:18 2014 UTC,"It is my understanding that primes are useful because it takes longer to factor a number than it does to verify the factorization.   I would argue that that's not quite why primes are so useful. Rather, it's because prime numbers induce more convenient algebraic structures. Some examples:   Finite fields with N elements exist only when N is a prime or & prime power. Multiplicative inverses are super convenient. Cyclic groups are useful for Diffie-Hellman kinds of crypto. A cyclic group of order N decomposes with the factorization of N -- basically, a cyclic group contains a ""sub structure"" of order p if p is a divisor of N. And generally most crypto attacks on a cyclic group scale with the smallest divisor of N. So primes give you the most security bang for your buck. This is in particular why safe primes are nice: When p is prime, the set of quadratic residues mod p is a cyclic group with (p-1)/2 elements. When p is a safe prime, this number (p-1)/2 is also prime, so the quadratic residues mod p can be used for nice crypto stuff.   In particular, in all these examples there is no secrecy about the prime number. Everyone can agree on the same prime number -- security comes from other aspects of the system. The prime is there to simply provide the appropriate algebraic structure.  I think these kinds of things are more fundamental than the factorization aspect of RSA, where a secret prime is crucial to security."

This is important for public key crypto for a few reason's. Mainly that it allows you to pick primitives in a set of some prime number p without them being easy to break, short of trying to guess what number was selected from the set, and in a 512 bit set this is essentially impossible.

That's 37780034796966026728782647732550733631496032533991228689601125943786752176986069699757904216566172328596649572383182421949505569287306881594507257111258 prime numbers.  If you want to start your computer counting that high, go ahead, but don't call me when you're done; the Sun will have gone out by that time.   It is my understanding that primes are useful because it takes longer to factor a number than it does to verify the factorization.   Actually, no.  All public-key cryptography in practical use is based on one of two mathematical problems:  First is factorization, the one you're describing.  This is the RSA algorithm.  If you have a number n whose factors are all large primes (normally n = pq is the product of two primes of almost the same size), then you can compute y = xe mod n easily (where x=plaintext and y=ciphertext), and there is a corresponding decryption exponent such that x = yd mod n.  But to find d requires knowing the factors of n, and that's hard to do.  The second, which is actually used more these days, is the discrete logarithm problem.  This relies on the fact that y = gx mod p is easy to compute, but it's hard to find x = log_g y.  There is a prime involved here, but it's not secret.  Everyone knows what it is."

crypto,2qbor9,cunttard,5,Thu Dec 25 00:57:46 2014 UTC,"Re stouset about a misconception for finding a new prime is to find the next one. This is normally not how we do it.  Typically we generate primes probabilistically using Miller-Rabin Primality Test. A very concise explanation is found on this page under note #1.  Most primes generated used in cryptography are known as probabilistically prime, as in they have a probability of being composite (i.e. not prime). Typically this probability is 1/280, which is insignificant to worry about -- I would imagine winning a pick the numbers type lottery three consecutive times is much much much more likely than your generated prime being composite.  We now know of a deterministic way of determining if a number is prime, but at high computational (and memory) cost. Miller-Rabin tends to be sufficient.  Edit: Initially the probability I had stated was 1/240 which is incorrectly based on Miller-Rabin being run 40 times. However a Miller-Rabin trial will succeed with probability 1/4. Therefore 40 rounds is probability 1/280."
crypto,2qbor9,FermiAnyon,2,Thu Dec 25 03:08:36 2014 UTC,1/240 is pretty significant.  You can run through that on your personal computer.
crypto,2qbor9,cunttard,3,Thu Dec 25 02:18:36 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure I follow, 1/240 is the probability of generating a prime that is actually composite."
crypto,2qbor9,autowikibot,2,Thu Dec 25 03:36:37 2014 UTC,"I understand what you said.  But that's just one in a trillion.  It's a small chance if you're doing it by hand, but there are lots of transactions going on in the world and it seems like you'd be getting several composites sneaking by each year at least and that seems like an unreasonable chance to take if you're a professional cryptographer and you can help it."
crypto,2qbor9,cypherpunks,3,Thu Dec 25 04:41:55 2014 UTC,"Looks like I had a misunderstanding of Miller-Rabin. I was under the impression the trial succeeds is 1/2, but it is actually 1/4. So the error margin is much worse, looking at 1/280 for a prime to actually be composite. I had confused it with Solovoy-Strassen algorithm where a trial succeeding is 1/2."
crypto,2qbor9,stouset,1 point,Thu Dec 25 05:04:50 2014 UTC,"Miller–Rabin primality test:       The Miller–Rabin primality test or Rabin–Miller primality test is a primality test: an algorithm which determines whether a given number is prime, similar to the Fermat primality test and the Solovay–Strassen primality test. Its original version, due to Gary L. Miller, is deterministic, but the determinism relies on the unproven generalized Riemann hypothesis;  Michael O. Rabin modified it to obtain an unconditional probabilistic algorithm.

crypto,2qbor9,hdet,3,Thu Dec 25 07:58:39 2014 UTC,You seem to be suffering from the misconception that the only way to find a new prime number is to take the current largest-known prime and find the next.  This is not even remotely the case.
crypto,2qbor9,reallyserious,1 point,Thu Dec 25 03:36:49 2014 UTC,"The way I've seen RSA described, implementations generally pick and use large numbers that they are pretty sure are prime."
crypto,2qbor9,TheSuperficial,6,Thu Dec 25 09:13:40 2014 UTC,How are 20 character passwords useful if there is a list of all 20 character passwords?
crypto,2qbor9,reallyserious,4,Thu Dec 25 03:13:11 2014 UTC,"Let's expand on this.   Let's construct a alphabet consisting of all characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and 10 special characters. That's 72 different characters to choose from.   In order to store one 20 character password we need 7 * 20 = 140 bits = 17.5 bytes. Let's align that to the nearest whole byte to make it easier to implement. So 18 bytes for one combination.   The number of 20 character password combinations is 7220 = 1.4 * 1037 .   In order to store all of those we need 7220 * 18 = 2.52 * 1038 bytes = 2.29 * 1026 TiB.  The largest hard drives you can buy today are 8TB. So we need (7220 * 18) / (8*10004) = 3.15 * 1025 of those hard drives. There aren't that many hard drives in existance."
crypto,2qbor9,Ar-Curunir,2,Thu Dec 25 02:48:24 2014 UTC,"In order to store one 20 character password we need 27 * 20 = 2560 bits = 320 bytes. (each character can be represented in 27 = 128 bits so we don't need a whole byte for each character)   Wait, what?  We need 7 bits per character, not 128 bits.  So that's 140 bits for 20 characters.

See, for example, NIST SP 800-90.  In fact, you could easily use a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) that has backtracking resistance to build your system.  This would have the advantage that the generation of keys is using a tool designed for the job and evaluated by a large number of cryptographers.  Assume g0 is the state of the generator at time zero, DRBG is the function that consumes a generator state and returns a specified number of bits along with a new state.  The pseudo code would be basically:  let g = g0 log(msg, g) =     let (key, newGen) = DRBG(g,128)     g := newGen     output(msg, HMAC(key,msg))   Much like your system, deleted messages will be apparent because the ith message would fail to authenticate with the ith stepping of the DRBG (or ith hash of the seed, for your system).  This property could be more directly achieved by keeping and signing running hash of all prior messages.  Now is this a curiosity or do you have a need for such a system?"

And are you talking about concealing the fact that a user is using I2P at all, as from their internet service provider?  If so, then that is not a very practical request, for several reasons:   It is not a goal of any mature anonymity network, including Tor, I2P, Freenet, and all others that I know of, to actually conceal the fact that the user is using that network - only to conceal what they are doing on it. EDIT: Tor Bridge Relays are indeed an exception to this, but a similar concept may not be practical for I2P for the reasons below, and others. It is likely not possible to conceal the fact that such a network is being used, at least for interactively-routed networks like I2P, where most users also act as relays for other users' traffic. The best you might be able to do is run everything on port 443 (the standard HTTPS port) with HTTPS-like handshakes, but that would be only one way and the overall traffic flow wouldn't be very similar to HTTPS. Another option might be to conceal it as encrypted BitTorrent traffic, but again, the traffic flow pattern is fairly different. Additionally, since these networks publish the addresses of relays publically, as they must in order for other users to find them, no matter what kind of traffic pattern or masking is used, whether someone is using the network can still be determined with ease by cross-referencing which computers their traffic is directed to/from and which are a part of the network. Notions of steganography involving images or other media files, etc., make even less sense than such protocol-masking in such a situation, and would add to the CPU and bandwidth overhead enormously. These networks are already terribly constrained by these bottlenecks. I2P does meet ""its actual objective of protecting the user from being singled out as suspicious"" - all I2P users look like just another I2P user, although some send and receive more traffic than others, and some use only TCP or UDP instead of both. It is likely impossible, for the reasons above and others, to make them look like just another internet user. There simply is not any other activity that one does on the internet that even remotely resembles the kind of traffic employed by these tools. If users wish to conceal from their ISP the fact that they're using these networks, the best option available to do so is probably to route their connection to the network through a VPN or similar encrypted tunnel. However, the timing and traffic flows are still fairly distinct.   If I have misunderstood what you're saying, or if you feel that I've missed anything, please bring it to my attention and I'll attempt to correct myself. But I strongly believe that what you're describing is impractical, and that perhaps you don't have a complete understanding of the principles involved with these types of tools."

I also wasn't aware that I employed any ""mathematical excuses"" - I feel like the points I raised are all related to much broader truths about the actual protocols and traffic patterns employed, which are pretty constrained as to how much they can be altered. I myself don't have enough knowledge of the underlying mathematics to make even basic judgments about the feasibility of steganography on that level. But on higher levels, it seems like a rather difficult challenge, for the reasons I gave.  The differences between an interactive, mutli-stream networked system and simpler channels as relates to steganography are clear, and it is my belief (perhaps a mistaken one) that the nature of those differences, specifically the extremely specific and copious traffic patterns involved, make steg solutions difficult to implement.  As to your last point, I did not use the word ""perhaps"" sarcastically, and I think your reaction is quite out of proportion. Considering that you misspelled ""steganographic"" in your initial comment, and that you fundamentally misrepresented or misunderstood the goals of the project, and furthermore sought to submit unrelated feedback about the project here instead of communicating it to the developers or bug tracker directly over what seems to be a long period of feeling the way you do, it seemed reasonable to consider the possibility that your understanding was limited. As that consideration was made in error, I certainly apologize, but I think that what I said was indeed reasonable.  Since /u/NeuroG made a reply that discussed some of the steganographic transports used for Tor Bridge Relays, which I didn't know were implemented, I am certainly reconsidering the feasibility of such a system for I2P, but of course I'm not a developer and have little ability to implement them. I suspect that a similar system may not actually work in I2P, since by its very nature, virtually all I2P users are also relay nodes, and therefore the traffic patterns are extremely different from those of a non-relay Tor user. But again, my own understanding of these things is limited. It is a useful consideration regardless.  Once again, my apologies for offending you, and I hope that it doesn't reflect on the project itself (which I have no direct involvement in).

I took a look at the cryptographic section of your technical introduction, specifically the section on ElGamal/AES+SessionTags.  An alternative to that construction is the crypto_box primitive avalaible in NaCl, an implementation of which is available in Java (via the JNI). This is a construction of curve25519(DH)+xsalsa20(symmcrypto)+poly1305(authentication), which encrypts messages from a source curve25519 keypair to a destination curve25519 public key and requires a unique, random, non-repeating nonce per message.  A summary of how it works: A shared encryption key is created by a DH exchange on the curve25519 keys. This key is then fed together with the nonce into the XSalsa20+Poly1305 encryption scheme to encrypt and authenticate the message.  Note that the shared encryption key is constant for a given pair of source and destination, hence why a non-repeating nonce is required.  Note that using this construction would mean AES would no longer be required, you could just crypto_box your message directly instead of crypto_boxing an AES encryption key. This implementation decision is of course up to you.  If signatures are required: Curve25519 keys can also be converted to Ed25519 keys, which can then be used for signing with the crypto_sign primitive. It may be easier to have separate signing and DH keys, however."

crypto,2owv0q,locomotorcat,28,Wed Dec 10 22:50:26 2014 UTC,"Woohoo! Hybrid proofs! I've spent a lot of time thinking about effective ways to teach the ideas. So let me know what you think of this.  I like to take a view that is sort of the contrapositive of what you're being taught. (It's more like the style of ""code-based games"" of Bellare & Rogaway, if you must know)  Suppose you have this big complicated cryptographic construction, and it involves many applications of various crypto ingredients. Traditionally, you would say: if you give me an adversary attacking my construction, I can transform it into an adversary breaking (one of) the ingredients. Since we assume the ingredients are secure, this is impossible so my scheme is secure.  Instead of this, think of each crypto ingredient as coming with a ""security rule"" that lets you change parts of a big interaction.   Security for a PRG says that if the seed s is random and used nowhere else in the system, then you can replace PRG(s) with true randomness, and it will change the behavior of the system by only a negligible amount. Security for CPA encryption says that you can replace encryptions of messages by encryptions of any other messages (if the key is used nowhere in the system besides for encryptions), and it will change the behavior of the system by only a negligible amount. etc   When I teach this, I generally draw out a cryptographic construction using a schematic diagram. I then give these ""security rules"" as pictorial rules for rewriting the schematic diagram. So if you are using a component that you claim is secure, you are allowed to rewrite parts of your diagram according to the appropriate rules. If you are trying to prove your construction secure, you have to show that the appropriate rewriting rule for your big system can be derived from the rewriting rules for its ingredients.  So you want to prove the security of your scheme based on the security of its ingredients. Say you are proving security of a PRG construction. Then you know that you have to start with the diagram that describes your PRG getting a random seed as input, with output going to some system.. then by applying the given rules for the ingredients of your construction, reach a diagram that just involves true randomness going into the same system.  The point of a hybrid argument is that no matter how you think about these things, you can only apply one ""security rule"" at a time. In my language, you can only change the picture in one way at a time. Typically there is only one way to apply the rules that gets you to where you're going.    Here's an example. You have a length-doubling PRG called G. That means you are allowed to use the following rewriting rule:  PRG RULE       $                                 =========      +                  $ $                            | n bits           + +                         +---+                | |             can replace  | G |        with    | | 2n bits                   ++-++                | |                           | | 2n bits         v v                           v v                                  In my diagrams, dollar sign denotes a source of n uniform random bits. Each ""wire/line"" carries n bits. Got it so far? You can replace 2n pseudorandom output bits of G with 2n truly random bits. By replace, I mean that no polytime algorithm will be able to tell the difference (except with negligible bias). This is the definition for PRGs that we know and love.  Let's use notation GL(s) and GR(s) to denote the left and right halves of G's output on seed s. Imagine you are asked to prove that the construction GL(s) || G(GR(s)) is a secure length-tripling PRG. In other words, you want to show:  WANT TO SHOW    $                                ============    +   +---+              $ $ $                        |   |   v              + + +                     +-+-+ | +-+-+            | | |       can replace   | G | | | G |    with    | | | 3n bits               ++-++ | ++-++            | | |                     | |  |  | |             v v v                     | +--+  | |                                      |       | |                                      v       v v                         Right? You want to show that no one would be able to tell the difference between the output of your construction and 3n truly random bits. That's what it means for your construction to be a secure PRG.  OK, so you have to start at the left side and apply rules you know about, to get to the right side. Obviously you have to replace each G according to the rule above, but the key is that you can only do one G at a time! The ""PRG rule"" doesn't apply to the second instance of G (because it's input is not truly random -- the rewriting rule says the input should be truly random). But the rule does apply to the first instance of G, so that's pretty much the only thing you can do at this point!  To be clear, you start with this diagram:    $                                  +   +---+         |   |   v       +-+-+ | +-+-+   | G | | | G |   ++-++ | ++-++    | |  |  | |     | +--+  | |                        |       | |                        v       v v                         .. then apply the PRG rule to the first instance of G and you get:   $ $                                + +  +---+        | |  |   v        | |  | +-+-+    | |  | | G |    | |  | ++-++    | |  |  | |     | +--+  | |                        |       | |                        v       v v                         Hey, what do you know? In this diagram, the second instance of G is receiving truly random input, unlike before. So the PRG rule does apply to that second instance of G. If you apply that rule, you get:      $ $ $            + + +           | | |           | | |     | | |          v v v        Which is what you wanted. Yay, life! Note how things had to happen in this order. Finding out the right order to press all the buttons is the fun part (for me) of doing crypto security proofs.  Now how does this relate to the ""traditional"" style reduction you've been taught?  Suppose you can distinguish between the 1st and 3rd picture, then you can distinguish between either 1 & 2 or between 2 & 3 (pigeonhole). But each of these pairs differ by a single application of the PRG rule -- this is by design! So say we had an adversary D that distinguished well between the output distributions of pictures 2 & 3. Then we could easily make a distinguisher for the PRG security of G -- just combine D with the part of the picture that doesn't change between pictures 2 & 3."

crypto,2owv0q,rosulek,3,Thu Dec 11 05:23:41 2014 UTC,"For this example, it might look something like this:  You want to show that, given an adversary that distinguishes the construction from random, you can use it to construct an adversary breaking the underlying PRG.  Suppose you're given an adversary D that distinguishes the distribution GL(s)||G(GR(s)) from random (with s chosen uniformly) with bias ε. So D is an algorithm that takes 3n bits of input. Now consider the following  algorithms, which take 2n bits of input:   A1: on input x = xL || xR, run D( xL || G(xR) ) and return the result A2: on input x, sample a random y (n bits), run D( y || x ) and return the result.   Notice how I pulled A1 and A2 out of my ass! They will make sense only later (but I can tell you a secret that A1 is the common part of pictures 1 & 2 from my proof; A2 is the common part of pictures 2 & 3 from my proof).   Now we can consider what A1 does when its input is chosen as random 2n bits or when its input is chosen as outputs of G. Similarly, we can consider the same two input distributions for A2 and ask what happens.  A1 and A2 are constructed so that:   A1 with PRG input produces exactly the same distribution as D running with input taken from our construction (the one that calls G twice, the one that we are trying to prove is a PRG). Call p1 the probability that D outputs 1 in this setting. A1 with random input produces exactly the same distribution as A2 with input taken from G's output. Call p2 the probability that D outputs 1 in this setting. A2 with random input produces exactly the same distribution as D running with random input. Call p3 the probability that D outputs 1 in this setting.   Note that there are only 3 possible distributions (hey, these are the three pictures I drew!), and the two ""endpoints"" are the ones involved in the PRG security definition for our construction.  We are given that |p1 - p3| = ε. Hence one of |p1-p2| and |p2 -p3| is at least ε/2 by the triangle inequality & pigeonhole principle. But:   |p1-p2| describes the bias that A1 has distinguishing G's output from random. |p2-p3| describes the bias that A2 has distinguishing G's output from random.   If ε is non-negligible (i.e., D breaks the PRG security of our construction), then ε/2 is also non-negligible. So either A1 or A2 (or both) break the PRG security of G.    If you don't like the ""either-or"" nature of the proof (that either A1 or A2 might break G, but we can't say which), you can do the following trick:  Define an algorithm A* that on input x, flips a coin and runs A1 half the time and A2 half the time. Then A* distinguishes G's output from random with probability |p1-p2|/2 + |p2-p3|/2 which is at least ε/2. So A* is a single, explicit algorithm that breaks G.    edit: I would argue that the opaqueness of the step where I state A1 & A2 (or A* ) is what is most counterproductive from a pedagogical standpoint. Everything else is going to be fairly standard, no matter which approach you take to proving things:    You've defined a sequence of interactions, each of which defines a probability.  Adjacent interactions differ by only one application of a crypto ""ingredient"", so the difference between adjacent probabilities corresponds to your advantage in breaking that primitive. Using triangle inequality + pigeonhole principle, you relate these adjacent differences to the difference between the first & last probabilities, which corresponds to the advantage in breaking the construction."

crypto,2owyay,Blargwill,6,Wed Dec 10 23:17:42 2014 UTC,"If F is a block cipher like AES, then (IV, F(k,IV)⊕m) is a secure encryption of m, for random IV, with key k (it's just CBC restricted to 1-block messages).  You can extend this to multiple keys in a commutative way, but increasing the size of the ciphertext. Basically, the parties have keys k1, k2, k3... and the encryption is   (IV1, IV2, IV3, ... , F(k1,IV1)⊕F(k2,IV2)⊕...⊕m)   Each party can ""take off"" their respective F(k,IV) contribution, in any order.  Some considerations: this provides CPA security, but does not provide authenticity. It is also symmetric-key.   In the public-key setting you can get commutative encryption from ElGamal. A normal ElGamal encryption of m is (gr , (gk )r * m) where k is the private key and gk is the public key. The important observation is that for a ciphertext (gr , (gk1+k2+k3+... )r * m), each person can ""take off"" their respective gkr contribution, in any order. Again, this provides CPA security but not authenticity."

crypto,2owyay,bitwiseshiftleft,1 point,Wed Dec 10 23:38:55 2014 UTC,"Mental poker:       Mental poker is the common name for a set of cryptographic problems that concerns playing a fair game over distance without the need for a trusted third party. The term is also applied to the theories surrounding these problems and their possible solutions. The name stems from the card game poker which is one of the games to which this kind of problem applies. A similar problem is flipping a coin over a distance.  The problem can be described thus: ""How can one allow only authorized actors to have access to certain information while not using a trusted arbiter?"". (Eliminating the trusted third-party avoids the problem of trying to determine whether the third party can be trusted or not, and may also reduce the resources required.)  In poker, this could translate to: ""How can we make sure no player is stacking the deck or peeking at other players' cards when we are shuffling the deck ourselves?"". In a physical card game, this would be relatively simple if the players were sitting face to face and observing each other, at least if the possibility of conventional cheating can be ruled out. However, if the players are not sitting at the same location but instead are at widely separate locations and pass the entire deck between them (using the postal mail, for instance), this suddenly becomes very difficult. And for electronic card games, such as online poker, where the mechanics of the game are hidden from the user, this is impossible unless the method used is such that it cannot allow any party to cheat by manipulating or inappropriately observing the electronic ""deck"".

Of course, that can quickly grow computationally unfeasible (not so much for this simple case), which is why good ciphers exist in the first place.  For example, in the case of a flawed OTP with a bit stream that is completely random (e.g. well compressed), all your knowledge is:  P(bi|ei)=P(ei|bi)*P(bi)/P(ei), where bi is the i-th received bit and ei is the encrypted bit.  In your case:  P(b=0|e=1)=P(e=1|b=0)*P(b=0)/P(e=1)= 1/2 + ε ( =P(1|0)=1-P(1|1)=1-P(0|0) )  You can quantify the amount of information you gained relative to the information you already had about the source by reading the cipher text, per bit:  Hgain = Hsource-Hnew = 1-H(1/2+ε) = 0.000288558 bits/bit,  for ε=0.01  This was introduced on one of the first serious papers on crypto, by shannon: http://netlab.cs.ucla.edu/wiki/files/shannon1949.pdf"

A OTP allows your encrypted message to ""inherit"" the entropy of the OTP itself. If you are encrypting plain english text (which is fairly low entropy) with a OTP which has resonably high entropy, then a) it is not possible to decipher with absolute certainty, and b) the number of likely possibilities is still very high and very difficult even for something as small as 160 chars."

Otherwise, if your model is pretty good, you could introduce an error metric and simply pick the minimum error alternative.  The concept of ""inheriting entropy"" is detailed in the paper by shannon, by the way.  I'm not an expert, but I think it would be interesting to see this analysis of what's the treshold for the probabilities get high enough so that a single possibility emerges. In this case an analysis with different kinds of entropy is probably more suitable (and beyond my knowledge)."

According to the patent application this was deliberate to allow the enigma to be able to encrypt and decrypt without changing modes, and with much less parts. This can be seen in the schematics: There was only one tri-state switch for input keys and output lamps, which cut down the part count. Allowing self encryption would have needed a more complex layout, and thus made it more expensive, and would have made operation more complex (patent application, page 2, ll. 45ff):   Designing the terminating rotor as reflector and the contact buttons as toggle switches yields the advantage that the patented machine does not require a toggle, which was until now needed to switch from encrypting to decrypting and vice versa.

Here's the way I think about it. Suppose you have a random cipher:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ YPUZEKINCRSQWLAFDVMJXTBOHG   The pairings are random. Letters can become different letters (A -> Y) or they can become the same letter (E -> E).  Time for a simple question: what does this do?   Choose a letter: T Encrypt it: encrypt(T) = J Decrypt it: decrypt(J) = ?   It's obvious: you always end up with the same letter that you start with.  But what happens if we add an extra step?   Choose a letter: T Encrypt it: encrypt(T) = J Add one to it: J + 1 = K Decrypt it: decrypt(K) = ?   This time, you never end up with the same letter you start with, because:   J is the only letter that decrypts to T. Step 3 always changes the letter.   Now you can see how the Enigma is flawed:   Type a letter: T Encrypt it using a plugboard and three rotors: J Use a reflector that always changes the letter: K Decrypt it using three rotors and a plugboard: ?   Whatever the result is, it's not going to equal the input."

This admits weak (low entropy) passwords. This is what OTR does for mutually authenticating two parties. Wikipedia has a description of the protocol but I think the OTR paper by C. Alexander and I. Goldberg do a better job of explaining it (section 4).  EDIT/addendum:  To use this protocol as part of a larger protocol which provides confidentiality you could:   Bootstrap communication using anonymous diffie-hellman exchange to agree on a key for encrypted communication. Further communication is encrypted under the DH key. Perform mutual authentication using socialist millionaire protocol, combining the common secret and shared DH key with a function (a hash function is fine, but even concatenation will do), i.e. SHA256(g^xy || common_secret). This will demonstrate that the communicating parties know both the common secret and the shared DH key. If (1) was MITM then the protocol will fail and both parties will learn nothing about the DH key and secret, which is a good reason to back out completely.

Is this possible with the protocol you've suggested/currently done?   It is important to protect the storage of passwords on the server-side (and the client will need to derive the same hash in order to do so). This would be done using scrypt or pbkdf2.  However regardless of how the server stores the common secret (as a secure hash or in plaintext), it is important to emphasise that an adversary will learn absolutely nothing about the secret during an execution of the socialist millionaire protocol. The adversary is left having to either (1) steal the secret from either party or (2) impersonate the party during the protocol execution, i.e. an on-line attack.

I would simply say standards. I think tcpcrypt is attempting to address this problem, but I've not looked into the literature myself. Also I should say I really don't know, I'm an amateur at pretty much everything :).  Regarding why you should use a different password for every service, simply because you cannot trust the service provider to protect the secret correctly. You should assume the worst case evidenced by all the password hacks (linkedin, adobe, etc.) in the past few years. If an attacker can compromise one service and learn your password, it can has access to all your other services. Hence using a distinct password per service is the best approach. With the advent of lastpass, keypass, and other similar products -- managing secrets is finally becoming surprisingly easier."

Sure socialist millionaire protocol (SMP) is agnostic to how the common secret is determined. You bake whatever you want into the protocol, it can include a derived value if necessary.  However an adversary which steals the secret store can impersonate (MITM) both parties in SMP since the derived values are now the common secret between them.

This protocol could be implemented using any form of hashing and symmetrical encryption. Thinking of SHA3 Keccak and AES.  I am aware of two shortcomings:   this does not verify authenticity of the server, there may be a way to implement that this does transmit the password salt in plain text, but this salt is short-lived (renews after successful authentication), and the only way to know it's a real salt, is by witnessing a successful authentication."

Many ""cryptographically secure building blocks"" you mention are used because they have been mathematically proven to be secure.  It is true that other cryptographic tools aren't entirely based on mathematical proofs. For example, there's no mathematical proof that factoring integers isn't possible in polynomial time. This is probably because it's really hard to prove that something is impossible. This is part of the P versus NP problem, one of the greatest unsolved problems in mathematics.  However, we do know that we've been relying on integer factorization being hard for a long time, and still nobody has proved otherwise, despite enormous motivation to do so.

(Papers that use non-standard assumptions, of course, lose the right to have that implicit ""compelling"").  So yeah, I can see why you might feel either (1) betrayed or (2) like you've unearthed some dirty secret that crypto people are trying to keep buried.  But the term is used with these qualifiers left implicit because when cryptographers talk to each other, they assume the reader/listener will be aware of these issues.  And the approach, despite its flaws, has real value: If I'm building a new crypto algorithm, whether it be an encryption scheme, a MAC, a PRF, a CSPRNG, or a myriad of others, it doesn't need to be subjected to years of expert scrutiny. It just needs a proof that it's about as secure as the underlying blockcipher. It follows that you can trust the new algorithm as much as you trust AES, or the blockcipher of your choosing.  Even when these implicit qualifiers are correctly understood, the system is not without its flaws. Security definitions can fail to capture the desired properties. Models can fail to capture all relevant attacks. And sometimes there are errors in the proofs.  But, on the other hand... no one has really found a better alternative.

The whole reason behind substitution/xor ciphers is the complexity is fixed per operation and not dependent on the key or cipher text. The issue here is some combinations of cipher text and key can have weaknesses as the translation is data dependent (modern block ciphers don't have this dependence, the key is merely an xor on a state with a given schedule, then the text is just shuffled along the rounds).  That being said, it's very clever, and could likely be useful in a key scheduling system if bounds on the complexity weakening could be proven."

If your cipher has an if/then or while loop in it that isn't constant complexity (or, in the case of cellular automata, has repeating components) you can have weak keys/plaintexts that can compromise the data without the crypto-guy knowing. Random cipher-texts change nothing because the chance for a weak key is unchanged, as key/text weakness is calculated first for random plaintext/keys and then for likely or weak content."

crypto,2nugqg,TNorthover,3,Mon Dec 1 07:36:06 2014 UTC,"Basically. I mean you can just say 'these are weak keys', but part of the issue is that keys should have some bound of entropy, and the range of 'good key' to 'bad key' is huge here. If keys can be assured by group to be good or bad, and have the bounds computed from that, it makes a much better algorithm (I'm 99% sure this is possible for DCA's, but I haven't done the math personally).  DCA's are really cool math constructs, and really fun to work with, they just might be a bit clever for this particular purpose.  Btw, if you have an internal key IV, say, XOR the keys with a known pad to start, that would fix the 'some keys are known weak', but it would actually just shift the key weakness to a different, less obvious keyspace, which is again why non-deterministic algorithms tend to be frowned upon."

The diffusion is most worrying in that algorithm. It's not block based and for a message > 1024 bytes, you could twiddle an input and only affect one bit of the input in the last round (of the first byte, say). That gives you key[x] and key[x ^ 128]. You don't know what x is, of course, but I'd be very worried about that kind of information leaking."

crypto,2nugqg,conradsymes,4,Sun Nov 30 16:58:42 2014 UTC,"The diffusion is what worries me the most about this cipher, too.  Consider how AES works: it xors in the subkey, does a fixed substitution on each byte, and then applies a mixing function.  Using an xor and a fixed substitution is generally more convenient than having a substitution as a key: it makes the key space just a string of bytes instead of a permutation, and it's much better in hardware.  The known structure of the substitution can both guard against certain attacks, and can be exploited for fast implementations.  The biggest difference between your cipher and AES is the mixing function.  The AES mixing function can mix the entire state every two rounds.  All together, it needs only 10 rounds for 128-bit security.  With this 1-d mixing function, each byte affects only the byte on the right every round.  So you need a ton of rounds.  Without a fixed block size, encryption probably has to take quadratic time.  This will be true for almost any automaton cipher without a mixing function, unless perhaps it uses a high-dimensional automaton."

Also, Simon is designed for lightweight or DPA-resistant hardware.  It uses about 5 gates per bit with a latency of 2 xor's, and only half an AND gate per bit.  This is critical for DPA resistance, which makes XOR gates big and AND gates huge.  If instead you want speed from it in hardware, you can unroll 6-8 rounds and it will be similar in performance to AES.  This automaton cipher does not have those constraints.  The real point of my post is, OP is an amateur cryptographer who wanted to learn what's holding back the design of his cipher.  The main answer is that it needs a better mixing function."

The table is of size 256 and contains every possible byte.   But instead you can look up and replace pairs of bytes. Table would be of size 65536 and contain every possible pair of bytes. This would make keyspace much larger."
crypto,2nugqg,TNorthover,5,Sun Nov 30 16:33:30 2014 UTC,"Ok, so it's a very simple shift and replace scheme. Unless I misunderstood, here's your fatal flaw:  Say you were encryption natural English text using that table. The letter E is very common in English, so let's say that your key specified that every E byte was to be replaced by the byte 147. Simple frequency analysis shows that 147 has a comparable frequency that E does given the length of the ciphertext, so the attacker guesses that 147 is a replacement for E. They then unravel the other bytes in a similar fashion. Obviously a larger keyspace would make this more difficult, but it could still be done if you had sufficiently long ciphertext such that you could do the frequency analysis on pairs of letters.  Would this be a fatal attack or am I misunderstanding your algorithm?"

We want our encryption to be secure, but we also want it to be fast.  You could limit it to always consider blocks of 16 bytes together (other numbers would do, but 16 is very common these days). Decide how many generations you need for that to be secure and just repeat the process: encrypt(&string[0], key, 16, rounds), encrypt(&string[16], key, 16, rounds), ...

A block cipher by itself is only suitable for the secure cryptographic transformation (encryption or decryption) of one fixed-length group of bits called a block.  A mode of operation describes how to repeatedly apply a cipher's single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger than a block.     Most modes require a unique binary sequence, often called an initialization vector (IV), for each encryption operation. The IV has to be non-repeating and, for some modes, random as well. The initialization vector is used to ensure distinct ciphertexts are produced even when the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times independently with the same key.  Block ciphers have one or more block size(s), but during transformation the block size is always fixed. Block cipher modes operate on whole blocks and require that the last part of the data be padded to a full block if it is smaller than the current block size.  There are, however, modes that do not require padding because they effectively use a block cipher as a stream cipher.  Historically, encryption modes have been studied extensively in regard to their error propagation properties under various scenarios of data modification. Later development regarded integrity protection as an entirely separate cryptographic goal. Some modern modes of operation combine confidentiality and authenticity in an efficient way, and are known as authenticated encryption modes.

See scrypt for an example of a memory intensive hash function.  I don't see any writeup of why you chose the scheme you did. While I can guess what the goals of your scheme are it would be nice to see them explicitly stated and then say how this scheme meets those goals.   Implementation Comments   Why not throw an exception instead of returning negative numbers on error cases? It's so much more tedious to have the caller check the return value and key off that. Also can lead to security issues if the caller doesn't check it correctly (less likely to happen with exceptions). You run the hmac repeat + 1 number of times.

This is less of a problem if repeats are high, but... ...your interface is counter-intuitive. Parameter called ""repeats"" is confusing. You're overcomplicating your API by exposing repeats (blah!) to every meaningful function. This is error prone. This is more of a comment on how people write PHP in general: checking every time for something that's constant in the environment (or should be, really) like the very existence of some function name is weird. This is something that should be pre-configured and at asserted in the code.

Anyway, for a bijection, you can use Elligator 2.  https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/325.pdf  The presentation there is a bit dense, but the basic idea is to use a Montgomery curve (equivalent to an Edwards curve), equation y2 = x(x2 + Ax + 1).  Note that if z = -A-x, then z2 + Az + 1 = x2 + Ax + 1.  If also z/x is nonsquare (eg, it's ur2 for a nonsquare u), then there is a y either for x or for z, but (except in certain extreme cases) not both.  Solve those two equations, and get x = -A / ( 1+ur2 ), z = -Aur2 / ( 1+ur2 )  This can give a passably efficient 1:1 map from bit strings of a certain length to a large subset of the elliptic curve.  But I wouldn't trust the encryption method from that arxiv post.  I suspect that the simplest way to beat ElGamal's size is for Bob to have more public keys B_i = gb_i .  Alice can use one ga with all of them, sending (ga; gab_i * m_i for each i) [[EDIT: not gb_i * m_i]].  So Bob might have 16 public keys, and the message expansion would be slightly more than 1/16.

GPG is as useful to the average joe for securing his privacy as a centrifuge is to the average joe for cooking.

We're due for a consumer device Thai does this but I can't really see it coming from the groups who could (read google, Apple etc). Open source can deliver the tech for doing this it just, as much as I hate to say it, requires something of an canonical type venture to really get it in the hands of Joe blogs and not have him quit when he realizes he needs to format the only usb he has to install this group of programs named after sonic characters."

crypto,2no46f,Natanael_L,1 point,Sat Nov 29 14:18:33 2014 UTC,"Thanks - and you're probably right that ""For Humans"" might be a bit of a stretch. ""For Techies who aren't Cryptanalysts"" is probably more accurate.  IMHO GPG is a pretty awful end-user application but could be an excellent component in some other software (eg Mailpile).  To get to that stage, however, I think we need more developers being comfortable with GPG. Then we're in a better position to wrap it / abstract it away.  It was painful reading Mailpile's blogpost about interfacing with GPG (https://www.mailpile.is/blog/2014-10-07_Some_Thoughts_on_GnuPG.html).  It struck me that very people have both the design skills to develop beautiful crypto applications and the familiarity with crypto / crypto components to actually push us forward.  So in summary, I think GPG should be a library to build upon, but getting there needs more developer interest & attention."
crypto,2nmoan,BreadInTheSky,13,Fri Nov 28 02:02:10 2014 UTC,"You're being taught by Jon Katz (or Lindell)? Ignore the grades completely and absorb as much material and knowledge as you can. That's how you become better. Take initiative and just do the problems in the book, not because its homework, but because you want to.  Midterms/Finals are unimportant in the grand scheme of things, you develop knowledge over time until you can recall it quicker.  I think you have a very unique opportunity studying under a great cryptographer. Spend that time wisely and spend less time focusing on grades.  Edit: Also, read the references + additional information at the end of every chapter (right before the exercises).

crypto,2nhwo0,jiannone,5,Wed Nov 26 19:50:37 2014 UTC,What makes this better than other OTR clients?  Can cryptocat plug into pidgin?
crypto,2nhwo0,maqp,9,Wed Nov 26 19:39:27 2014 UTC,"The abstract of whitepaper should explain the key differences. Compared to OTR, TFC greatly increases security at the cost of some convenience:  Crypto:   No QC / TLS-MITM attacks unlike asymmetric crypto and PKI (+) <> keys need to be pre-shared (-). OTP: No CT-only attacks (+) <> keydata exhausts after some hundreds of thousand of messages (-). OTP: Unconditionally secure msg integrity (+) <> keydata exhausts after some hundreds of thousand of messages (-). CEV: No single algorithm point of failure (+) <> more code to audit (-).   Key generation:   Open circuit design HWRNG: non-deterministic, backdoor-free entropy (+) <> hardware investments (-).   Key security:   No post-exploitation unless SW / HW is initially backdoored or afterwards physically compromised (+) <> Investing two additional computers for dedicated use as TCB units (-). When using RPi computers with cheap peripherals, the price of system starts at around $300, excluding tools.   So TFC is better than OTR if your threat model includes automated network based endpoint-exploitation using zero-days, practiced by governments every day: NSA with malware such as Flame, Regin, or program codenamed Foxacid - Metasploit, only with a budget. GCHQ, Germany, Netherlands and Finland and soon the FBI are doing it as well. If attacker fails to compromise the system during installation procedure, TFC is immune against key exfiltration unless it's physically compromised.  TFC uses OTR but only to obfuscate and protect the protocol against traffic analysis. Also since you asked, although quite unrelated, Cryptocat doesn't plug into Pidgin."
crypto,2nhwo0,Jasper1984,2,Thu Nov 27 04:45:50 2014 UTC,"Security by obesity.. lol  Also mentions snooping on keyboard-cable or sound.. I dont know about the cable, but not sure what currents buttons cause, probably a lot more than capacitive sensing. The latter is literally the tiny difference in capacitance of your finger, so.. that sort of amounts of charge. Sound is also just that of hitting surface. Sounds a lot cheaper than precision piezos too. (by hardware implants, possibly in off-the-shelf computers)  The batteries sound like a bit of a pita... Not sure if that is worth it. Surely that can be sufficiently isolated with capacitors.(of sufficient capacitance, and response speed)  Edit: apparently there is another document, that is clearer on how it is to be used. Also, i think it might be nice to also have public-key based communication. For those, addresses can be on business cards and stuff. That seems more expensive to implement in hardware though, so it might not be worth it.  Edit2: well.. approaches assume stuff like three laptops.. involved. Maybe it can be improved.. Like having small devices for the Rx and Tx.."
crypto,2nhwo0,maqp,2,Sun Nov 30 01:32:50 2014 UTC,"RSA keys aren't the way to go if you want deniability for your conversations. I did look into key establishment using DHE. There were just too many problems: You need an additional data diode that transmits private key from TxM to RxM, or it must be manually typed.   Then you need to either manually type the very long public value received from contact to RxM, on TxM or you need to trust RxM to generate the shared secret = K_pubK_priv mod p that will be much shorter to type but since adversary can get malware inside RxM, it's more insecure.   Additionally the authentication of DHE public key would risk MITM in off-band communication and thus require meeting face to face. Physical PSK exchange isn't more prone to eavesdropping since in both cases adversary would need to get physical access to the key medium."
crypto,2nhwo0,Jasper1984,1 point,Sun Nov 30 19:05:28 2014 UTC,"I was thinking bitmessage/torchat/bitcoin-like etcetera keys that you type in manually, or find or something. They can be relatively short, because you can just throw the real public key in the message, and have the address be the checksum.  But then, that does require Rx and Tx to both know the private key, and if they have different ones, the issue is that Rx never sends a message to put the public key in.. So i see the problem there..  Tinchat is a very high-security-level thing.. Probably room for a level below that?"

crypto,2nhwo0,maqp,1 point,Thu Nov 27 08:20:09 2014 UTC,"I read that the OTP keys are shared physically, person to person. Yes, then a hardware random generator is probably needed to make it really secure. My salt is only used as a nonce and is likely insecure if used as a one time pad."
crypto,2nhwo0,AndersLindman,1 point,Thu Nov 27 09:09:08 2014 UTC,"If you obtain the keystream from PRNG by inputting a seed, the keystream is deterministic - not truly random, so what you have there is a stream cipher, not OTP."
crypto,2nhwo0,maqp,1 point,Thu Nov 27 15:53:07 2014 UTC,"Yes, true, with a PRNG it should be called OTPP (one time pseudorandom pad) or something like that. Tinfoil Chat uses real one time pads. Pretty neat."
crypto,2nhwo0,AndersLindman,1 point,Thu Nov 27 17:54:32 2014 UTC,It makes very little sense to generate large keyfile that contains stream cipher keystream when users can derive it from shared seed (key+nonce) using a PRNG as they go. The genKey.py kernel-entropy option is mainly suitable for quickly creating large keyfiles for testing. The HWRNG generated entropy can not be reproduced with any algorithm / device so the one-time-pad has to be pre-shared.  I don't think a chunk of stream cipher keystream should be called 'one-time pseudorandom pad' as people might confuse it with one-time pad and it's security properties.
crypto,2ngrwg,CenoCipherTeam,9,Wed Nov 26 09:50:48 2014 UTC,"There is absolutely no excuse for creating a new message format. All that does is to damage privacy because no two people end up having programs that can communicate. Use PGP, or S/MIME if you must. If you want to do a better UI, do a better UI for PGP or S/MIME. If you don't like any of the existing code bases, write new code for PGP or S/MIME (but don't be surprised if nobody wants it). If you don't like something about the formats, go to the IETF and try to get improvements standardized.  Any use of obscure algorithms like ISAAC needs to be justified by showing something ISAAC has that the standard algorithms don't. And if you want to ""layer"" algorithms, RNGs are a better place than bulk crypto.  I have a whole bunch of utilities on my computer that can encrypt a file using a password. I never use them because password based encryption isn't usually useful in the first place."
crypto,2ngrwg,cypherpunks,-1,Wed Nov 26 13:46:14 2014 UTC,"PGP is certainly quite optimal from a technical standpoint, and having been around for a couple of decades with some decent enough software options, it still hasn't gained widespread usage among the general mainstream populace. Possibly due to being a bit cumbersome and involved for the average non-tech-savvy user to tackle and configure, and probably also to encryption in general not really being seen as important or necessary to the masses until now. Lately there have been calls for encryption apps that are easy for the everyday user to pick up and use right away, and CenoCipher is our attempt to contribute to that application field. At the moment at least, symmetric password-based encryption solutions (supported under the hood by strong secure algorithms of course) are just easier for regular non-computer-geek users to deal with.  That being said, this program's existence doesn't prevent anyone who's comfortable with PGP from using it. It just provides an alternative option for those who might find the latter a little too daunting for their taste. Everyone gets to use whichever approach they prefer, and the likelihood is that the less technically inclined users in the second group were never going to get around to taking on PGP in the first place. This way at least they have an encryption option in between PGP and nothing at all.  We aren't really creating a new message format per se, since all the program does is create files. The transmission and delivery method for those files is completely up to the user, meaning they don't have to stop using the channels they're already used to: their current email account, instant messaging system, cloud storage service, etc. We see that flexibility as a benefit, rather than a restriction. It's certainly true that the sender and recipient both need to have the same program in order to open the files involved. However that's not much different than receiving a '.7z' file from someone and needing to have 7-zip in order to open it, or needing to have Word in order to read a .docx file. People are used to that.  Those who want to communicate with each other via Skype, Whatsapp, Cryptocat etc.. need to have the same program installed on both ends too, so it's nothing new.  If we think we can create an improved utility and easier interface for OpenPGP-based communication, that would bridge the gap and soften the normally thorny plunge for Joe User, we may take a shot at that as well. Anything that helps or creates viable options."

crypto,2ngrwg,R-EDDIT,-2,Wed Nov 26 12:09:14 2014 UTC,"Layered just means both algorithms are used to encrypt everything, first one and then the other, as mentioned above. Two layers of encryption, in case one (AES or Twofish) is ever broken or compromised in the future, you're still protected by the other. Separate keys are indeed used. Much as Truecrypt always offered/s the option to use any combination of AES/Twofish/Serpent desired.  No idea who or what DJB is. 'The crypt.to' domain was just a suitably available one from FreeDNS that seemed to fit with the purpose.

It is shown by a counterexample that the intuitive result, formally stated and proved in the literature, that a cascade is at least as strong as the strongest component cipher, requires the uninterestingly restrictive assumption that the enemy cannot exploit information about the plaintext statistics. It is proved, for very general notions of breaking a cipher and of problem difficulty, that a cascade is at least as difficult to break as the first component cipher. A consequence of this result is that, if the ciphers commute, then a cascade is at least as difficult to break as the most-difficult-to-break component cipher, i.e., the intuition that a cryptographic chain is at least as strong as its strongest link is then provably correct.   Tl;dr: They prove that a cascade of ciphers is only at least as strong as the first cipher in the cascade, not the strongest cipher. If the ciphers commute (e.g. are stream ciphers that xor the plaintext), there is no order to the ciphers so all may be considered ""first"" - so the cascade is at least as strong as the strongest cipher."

crypto,2nfq6o,Godspiral,5,Wed Nov 26 14:54:30 2014 UTC,"It depends on what you mean by ""the usual methods for key exchange"".  The normal way of key exchange is done by Diffie-Hellman, which is as strong as the Diffie-Hellman problem (which is believed to be the same as Discrete Logarithm).  Another possible way is to use public-key cryptography. Alice publishes her public key. Bob generates a random key and encrypts it with the public key. Alice then decrypts it with her private key. Breaking this requires factoring large numbers for RSA. Of course, if you can do this, then you don't need to exchange keys."

Nobody knows which standards by NIST are actually safe unless you're a really good cryptographer and can understand everything going on at the lower levels. Most people are not at this level and the ones that are could be working for one of the intelligence agencies to promote the weak standards...  I know certain cryptographers have picked holes in Dual EC DRBG.The NIST curves are suspect according to Bernstein. AES 256 has a bad key schedule where Schneier recommends downgrading to AES 128 or doubling the number of rounds to maintain a safe security margin. SHA3 has issues with uneven distribution of bits in the output and low avalance effect.  I just don't see any reason to trust NIST now or in the future with their past track record.

After all, with the AES and SHA3 competitions, the NSA is essentially getting free cryptanalysis from the academic community and can compare that with the internal NSA cryptanalysis. Thing is they don't have to publish the internal analysis. It leaves them in a unique position to choose an algorithm which everyone else thinks is strong but they secretly have an attack on. Then they can push that as the standard. What they can even do is have secret NSA teams be involved in the competition who submit algorithms all with certain weaknesses/very subtle design flaws.

We can't exactly take your comments as gospel without doing any proper analysis of your own now can we.   Dude, cryptographers (not just NIST!) have analyzed Keccak for 6 years now.  Pretty much any non-ideal property of either the permutation or the hash function is considered an attack.  The best known attacks cost 2200+ work for 8 of the 24 rounds.  But maybe it has a surprising weakness when fed Hamlet soliloquys.  To check this, I copy-pasted his test file into a JS SHA3 calculator, and nope, almost all the bytes change when you change an input byte.  So, nope, he screwed up.   The answer fundamentally agrees with the question actually.   No, it doesn't.  It points out that Rijndael was the best jack-of-all-trades, it won the informal votes at crypto conferences, and nobody hated it.  So it and SERPENT were the most obvious choices for the standard along.   I fundamentally disagree with your statement that we should trust the NIST.   I didn't say that we should trust NIST on everything.  Rather, I believe that many of the NIST standards (AES, SHA2, SHA3) are strong; and that Keccak in particular is a significantly more conservative hash than most alternatives (though Blake2 is much faster in software).  I also think that on the balance of evidence, the NSA probably didn't backdoor the NIST elliptic curves (they backdoored Dual EC DRBG, which is not a curve).  ""Probably"" isn't really good enough, and anyway we have better curves now (Edwards), so the NIST curves should still be replaced.   If their standards were any good they would have little to no problems even under years of intense cryptanalysis. There are always problems with their crap.   Really now?  No practical attack is known on the math of AES in any mode or key size.  No meaningful theoretical attack is known when it's used as designed (the mediocre key schedule only enables theoretical related-key attacks, and the traditional block cipher security model forbids the use of related keys).  AES still has a reasonable margin of security at all key sizes against theoretical attacks.  The side channel attacks on AES are annoying, but for some side channels other ciphers are much worse.  (Have you ever tried to defend an ARX cipher against power attacks?  It's a huge pain in the ass.)  No significant weakness is known in the NIST curves when used as designed.  There also cannot be a true backdoor in them.  Instead, a ""backdoor"" would consist of a secret algorithm known to NSA 15 years ago which breaks a large fraction (say 1/1M) of all curves, and can be detected and exploited by anyone who knows about it; but still no known property of those curves is suspect.  I find it amusing that the conspiracy theories are always about this sort of attack, and not that NSA just knows how to break every curve, and/or has a quantum computer, either of which is (IMHO) much more likely.  No significant weakness has been found in any of the SHA-2 algorithms, or in SHA-3.  The margin of security of SHA-3 is very high.  The only NIST algorithms which were broken, to my knowledge, were Dual EC DRBG (backdoored), DES, and SHA-0 / SHA-1.  SHA-0 was withdrawn almost immediately, and SHA-1 fell with its main competitor, MD5, but still hasn't been practically attacked at least on the outside.  DES was actually strengthened by the NSA, at least in some versions of the story, though possibly they also pressured IBM to reduce its key size."
crypto,2n5jp6,xJoe3x,0,Tue Nov 25 18:06:21 2014 UTC,"You focus a lot on the current lack of convincing public cryptanalysis and how that somehow means the ciphers are still secure from NSA, but you have no counter argument for my other arguments. In particular this: if they're in control of setting the encryption standards, why wouldn't they manipulate them in their favour so their secret BULLRUN program can defeat the encryption? If you read the leaked docs on the WP or Guardian archive you'll find a line similar to: ""define commercial crypto standards to be secure but amenable to NSA cryptanalysis"". AES and SHA3 will be no exception. The Clipper chip fiasco and export control regulations on crypto were long going on before AES appeared. They just figured out it would be easier to control the crypto if they can set the ""open"" standard more covertly. Public cryptanalysis just isn't good enough to figure out the weaknesses yet. Either that or they significantly underestimate their computing capability."

But it is unfalsifiable, and there is no evidence that it is correct, that is, there is no evidence that NIST manipulated AES or SHA3 or its EC, or that NSA meddled with these standards, or that NSA knows of weaknesses in them.  The NSA wrote SHA2, but there is no evidence that they backdoored it or have discovered a vulnerability.  Therefore I see little reason to believe or act on these theories.  What's more, AES and SHA2/3 are some of the best-reviewed crypto algorithms available.  By all means use SERPENT or Salsa20 or Chacha20 if you're concerned that AES might be weak.  The other ESTREAM finalists are probably no better than AES: Rabbit and Sosemanuk are known not to have 2256 security, the hardware ciphers are designed for 280 , and HC is too slow to initialize for most applications.  On the hash front, I would consider Blake2 to be too aggressive to recommend at this stage, especially for someone who is concerned that NSA can break SHA2/3, but maybe with more rounds it would be a good choice.  I haven't looked into older nonstandard hashes.  Curve25519 is a good curve for EC.  I hope that stronger curves (eg Goldilocks or E-521) will also reach that level of assurance, but I can't say they've done that yet."

crypto,2n5jp6,xJoe3x,2,Sun Nov 23 17:49:03 2014 UTC,"Dual EC DRBG:       Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator (Dual_EC_DRBG)  is a claimed cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) standardized by ANSI, ISO, and formerly by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Dual_EC_DRBG is based on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) and was for some time one of the four (now three) CSPRNGs standardized in NIST SP 800-90A.  Sometime before its first known publication in 2004, a possible backdoor was discovered with the Dual_EC_DRBG's design, with the design of Dual_EC_DRBG having the unusual property that it was theoretically impossible for anyone but Dual_EC_DRBG's designers (NSA) to confirm the backdoor's existence. Doubts about Dual_EC_DRBG's security and performance had also been expressed even before it was standardized. Bruce Schneier concluded shortly after standardization that the ""rather obvious"" backdoor (along with other deficiencies) would mean that nobody would use Dual_EC_DRBG.  In 2013, New York Times reported that documents in their possession but never released to the public ""appear to confirm"" that the backdoor was real, and had been deliberately inserted by the National Security Agency as part of the NSA's Bullrun decryption program. The alleged backdoor would allow NSA to decrypt for example SSL/TLS encryption which used Dual_EC_DRBG as a CSPRNG.  In December 2013, a Reuters news article alleged that in 2004, before NIST standardized Dual_EC_DRBG, NSA paid RSA Security $10 million in a secret deal to use Dual_EC_DRBG as the default in the RSA BSAFE cryptography library, which resulted in RSA Security becoming the most important distributor of the backdoored algorithm.  RSA responded to this and subsequent media reports to ""categorically deny"" any insinuation that RSA had ever knowingly colluded with the NSA to incorporate a flaw in Dual_EC_DRBG, saying ""we have never kept [our] relationship [with the NSA] a secret"".  Members of the ANSI standard group, to which Dual_EC_DRBG was first submitted, were aware of the exact mechanism of the potential backdoor and how to disable it,  but did not take sufficient steps to unconditionally disable the backdoor. The general cryptographic community was initially not aware of the potential backdoor, until of Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson 2007 rediscovery, or of Certicom's Daniel R. L. Brown and Scott Vanstone's 2005 patent application describing the backdoor mechanism.

crypto,2n139z,AndersLindman,8,Fri Nov 21 22:41:51 2014 UTC,"I spent a few minutes looking over that code, and you are doing some really sketchy things. Most of them appear to be dirty work-arounds to avoid using your Feistel cipher in ECB mode. For example, it looks like you use different keys each time you invoke the Feistel cipher and you use a (low entropy!) salt together with some more key material (the string ""test"") to generate a sort of one-time pad that you xor into the resulting ciphertext.  These additions succeed in making it not obvious if a message block is repeated within a message or appears in two separate messages. It's great that you're thinking about these issues. But it doesn't do so in a way that's very efficient, and I am dubious about whether it's actually secure.  Read up on different modes of operation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation) to learn how to solve these problems efficiently and securely. The advantage that these modes have over your technique is that you can actually prove them secure under a reasonable set of assumptions. You also avoid the problems with restricting the message length.  A separate issue is padding. Currently, your encryption scheme uses a null character to mark the end of a message, and thus cannot accommodate binary data. You can fix this by using various padding schemes; PKCS #7 provides a common one (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_%28cryptography%29#PKCS7).  Now to answer your original question...  The best answer is ""sort of"". It's secure under the heuristic assumption that SHA256 is a so-called ""random oracle""; the ""Random Oracle Model"" basically says, ""We know SHA256 doesn't produce random values, but sometimes it's convenient to pretend it does, and in most cases this won't come back to bite us."" You are also implicitly making this same ""Random Oracle"" assumption in your round functions, which you compute using R_K(X) = SHA256(X xor K). (Where K is the subkey and X is the input).  A better way of constructing pseudo-random functions from hash functions is to use HMAC. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code). In your case, you might be okay with your current approach because your inputs are always the same length, and where the random oracle model really starts to break down is when you're hashing adversary-influenced strings of various lengths. (See length extension attacks, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack). But it's best to stick with methods that have already withstood a lot of  scrutiny and analysis.  Playing around with crypto can be fun if you're just doing it for fun or for educational purposes, but please don't ""roll your own crypto"" if you intend to protect yourself or others.  This answer went on for a while, so I'm sorry for the rambling. I hope you find it helpful, and I certainly hope I my comments were not discouraging."
crypto,2n139z,shiny_thing,1 point,Sat Nov 22 06:20:35 2014 UTC,"I think the salt value actually has pretty high entropy. Tricky to test the randomness of the salt values since the generation is really slow (about half a second for a single salt). The value hash('test') is only used in the demo to simulate a private key. That value will in a real application be replaced by a real 256-bit private key.  EDIT: Ok, the original salt value has somewhat low entropy probably and that's why the salt is 1024 bits. The value used in the cipher is a 256-bit hashed version of the 1024-bit salt. I meant that the hashed salt has high entropy."
crypto,2n139z,Natanael_L,6,Sat Nov 22 07:12:16 2014 UTC,Hashing low entropy inputs don't increase entropy.
crypto,2n139z,Natanael_L,1 point,Sat Nov 22 23:08:44 2014 UTC,"I believe it does increase the entropy (per bit) generally when a longer message is hashed into a shorter length. For example if the 1024-bit salt has an entropy of 0.7 bits per bit the 256-bit hash may have 0.9 bits per bit. Something like that.  In my application the Shannon entropy for the salt may be fairly high since it's generated by sampling the nanosecond computer clock with the jittery setTimeout() function. However, Shannon entropy is different than randomness because it only takes into account the independent probabilities of the bits.  Conditional entropy is maybe a little bit better measurement of randomness but even that is inadequate. Kolmogorov complexity takes into account all dependencies between the bits and is perhaps an even better measurement of randomness.  An extreme example is a string 0101010101010... which has maximal basic Shannon entropy H = 1, yet the string is totally ordered and an unlikely sample of a white noise stochastic process. In theory the ordered string is as likely as any other combination, yet there are much fewer ordered strings like that possible than ""unordered"" strings.  Here is a demo of the salt generator used in my cipher: http://jsfiddle.net/tc8kfnwm/"

crypto,2n139z,cunttard,1 point,Sun Nov 23 08:31:45 2014 UTC,"I'm not exactly sure what entropy density means but it sounds similar to what I meant. The entropy per bit will generally increase for the hash value (digest) compared to the message. The total entropy of the digest can be less than for the message when the entropy per bit is higher for the digest than the entropy per bit for the message.  I estimate that the 256-bit hash of the salt I use has an entropy of close to 1 bit (per bit), and the 1024-bit salt slightly less than that. So as a 256-bit sequence it has enough entropy and randomness. One possible risk is that in some devices the performance.now() function is poor and returns too coarse nanosecond clock resolution. In practice I think it will work even in smartphones."
crypto,2n139z,cunttard,2,Sun Nov 23 10:15:50 2014 UTC,"Certainly not against all attacks. I think the key schedule is more a matter of ""don't cock it up"" than giving real strength to a cipher.  Differential and linear cryptanalysis for example peel off the key round by round, so the difficulty multiplier even from a perfectly independent key is just ""#rounds * #key-bits-per-round"". That's mostly lost in the noise even when you're talking about 250 vs 255 difficulty.

I use four rounds of SHA-256 in my cipher. That's likely too few for that hash function. The main trick however is that I use a stream cipher based on the Rule 30 cellular automaton on top of the Feistel cipher. Stephen Wolfram has done extensive research about that and shown that this cellular automaton can produce highly random sequences.

It is used in different ways by different fields,  Usually, this refers to mathematical proofs, which are common in cryptography. In such a proof, the capabilities of the attacker are defined by an adversarial model (also referred to as attacker model): the aim of the proof is to show that the attacker must solve the underlying hard problem in order to break the security of the modelled system. Such a proof does not consider side-channel attacks or other implementation-specific attacks, because they are usually impossible to model without implementing the system (and thus, the proof only applies to this implementation).  Outside of cryptography, the term is often used in conjunction with secure coding and security by design, both of which can rely on proofs to show the security of a particular approach. As with the cryptographic setting, this involves an attacker model and a model of the system. For example, code can be verified to match the intended functionality, described by a model: this can be done through static checking. These techniques are sometimes used for evaluating products (see Common Criteria): the security here depends not only on the correctness of the attacker model, but also on the model of the code.

However, from a math standpoint, what you observed I think might be pretty neat.   I'm tired of not knowing how this works.   What do you mean ""works""?  Do you mean the nature of your scheme working for certain numbers and not others and how it does complete cycles in the good cases?

I would consider looking at something like   http://www.math.ias.edu/~goresky/pdf/Fib.jour.pdf  and trying to state your results in their language.  I do feel you are in a bit of a catch-22 situation here: anyone who is equipped to fully analyze your problem would also find it insufficiently interesting or consequential to spend their time on.

Apparently changing any of these will change which intervals ""work"").  For example, for an 8 bit LFSR with taps 0, 2, 3, and 4 (0 being the LSB) and a 4 bit sub LFSR with taps 0 and 1, with the 4 bit inner register existing as the 4 lowest significant bits of the full register, and both registers shifting towards the LSB, then 11 ""works"" by producing (2n-1)*(i+1) states, specifically that's (28-1)(11+1) = 3,060 states.  12 is not a ""working"" interval because it does not produce 3,315 states.

As such it is a type of public-key encryption in which the public key of a user is some unique information about the identity of the user (e.g. a user's email address). This can use the text-value of the name or domain name as a key or the physical IP address it translates to.  The first implementation of an email-address based PKI was developed by Adi Shamir in 1984,  which allowed users to verify digital signatures using only public information such as the user's identifier.  ID-based encryption was proposed by Adi Shamir in 1984.  He was however only able to give an instantiation of identity-based signatures. Identity-based encryption remained an open problem for many years. One example of the research leading up to identity-based encryption is provided in Maurer.

Furthermore, implementing shor's algorithm requires building something more analogous to a quantum asic or fpga customized to the n you wish to factor, rather than a general factoring quantum computer.  pop-sci treatments of quantum computing leave the reader with the impression that the algorithms execute in O(1) time to find all solutions, but shor's algorithm and quantum FFT appear to just be polynomial time.

I think it becomes exponentially harder to achieve high fidelity state preparation with the number of qubits.  My real argument comes from the rate of progress that has been made so far.

What additional issues are there? Obviously it has to scale.   I'm really confused about your issue with state preparation? It seems to me we are already doing that with quantum communication..

Fundamentally, I believe in error correction but I'm pessimistic about the lack of progress in the experimental side.  Basically, Quantum Control is an old field even though it's only been applied to quantum information recently. For some reason, it's been impossible to create systems of more than a handful of qubits that can interact with reasonable fidelities.  My larger point is that I don't appreciate articles that cite the same distant possibility as the reason for doing quantum information research. Compare it to articles that cite every advance in materials engineering research as progress towards building a space elevator."

Even if you or anyone else thinks that the possibility for the use of quantum computing to expand and proliferate, I (personally) think it is important that we treat this as a serious threat. (not to mention the fact that some researchers think it may be possible to somehow do certain types of computation on a classical computer)  And once we treat it as a serious threat, we can begin to think of ways we can change our systems to be resistant to these theoretical (or not so) attacks. For example, right now people are working in getting lattice based asymmetric cryptography.

crypto,2lz4u1,ldpreload,1 point,Wed Nov 12 11:31:40 2014 UTC,"what is the difference between ""small parts of multi-gigabyte files"" and ""one of the many data blocks the original data is split into""?   One is that I'd occasionally like to decrypt streaming data; every so often I use SSL and SSH. A definition of a cipher as a strict function C = E(K, P) does not permit this. (You can tweak your definition, but the most obvious way ends up turning a stream cipher into a 1-byte block cipher that can only be used in its own custom mode, which is IMO a fine way to think of it, and equivalent to defining a distinction between stream and block ciphers.)  Another is that I generally don't want each data block to have its own IV.  Another is that, once you have a cipher that works by splitting the original message into data blocks, you, uh, kind of have a block cipher.   why RC4 and AES-CBC are different? can you tell me what is the difference from the user's viewpoint?   Apart from the random access thing, which is absolutely a difference.... AES-CBC requires padding (or ciphertext stealing or something); RC4 does not. RC4 is more malleable than AES-CBC. AES-CBC has side channels that RC4 does not, which is relevant if you're a sysadmin running an SSLv3 server. RC4 has statistical biases that AES-CBC does not.  More fundamentally, a user is going to be using an existing cryptographic library and talking with other people who have learned crypto, and, for better or worse, all crypto libraries with nontrivial use implement AES as a sort of thing called a ""block cipher"" that takes one of many ""modes of operation"", and RC4 not as that sort of thing. A student of a crypto class who has not learned these terms and is therefore confused at the library has not gained a working knowledge of crypto from the class.  You would almost be better off saying (e.g.) here is the NaCl box, here is the SJCL box, here is the TripleSec box, etc., and leave them with no more knowledge of the letters ""AES"" at the end. There are strong advantages to this approach. But I'm not sure it makes sense to call such a class a ""crypto"" class."
crypto,2lz4u1,pint,1 point,Wed Nov 12 12:17:49 2014 UTC,"okay, so what is your point here? you are saying that on a crypto course, it is important to teach what kind of ciphers support byte sized packets with no authentication but minimal overhead? you know what, you can recommend that course. i will recommend the other one."
crypto,2lz4u1,ldpreload,1 point,Wed Nov 12 19:05:48 2014 UTC,"My point is that in a crypto course, it is important to leave students understanding what ""AES"" is and what ""RC4"" is. If you're teaching a class where the answer is ""This is something magical, you don't need to understand it, here's a higher-level library"", that's certainly a valuable class to teach (and honestly it would be a fantastic part of an intro CS class or other required class), but it's not a crypto course.  It would be kind of like teaching an algorithms class where you tell people to use their language's sort function and don't teach them bubblesort. That's probably correct software engineering advice, but it doesn't make an algorithms class."
crypto,2lz4u1,pint,1 point,Wed Nov 12 20:06:45 2014 UTC,"well, if you invent the arguments you are arguing with, it makes the debate that much easier. but in fact my argument wasn't that ""here is a lib, you don't need to know any more"". my argument was: you need to understand concepts first, like confidentiality, malleability, kinds of indistinguishability, pseudorandom, nonce and so on. understand attack vectors. then you learn how to build such constructs from basic building blocks like prfs, prps, etc. then only mention existing algorithms as examples.  and your example is perfect. i would never ever teach bubblesort."
crypto,2lz4u1,ldpreload,1 point,Wed Nov 12 20:25:21 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry, I'm not really trying to argue or debate, I was just trying to understand what you meant by your bullet point. I do agree that teaching concepts first is the right way to do it, but I think that you've got to end up mentioning names and classifications that are currently practically used in the field, at some point, regardless of whether they suck. For the ones that suck, you should explain why they suck, instead of hoping that students never run into things on their own. If that's what you meant, then we're agreeing, I just misunderstood you.  What are your grounds for not teaching bubblesort? Or, alternatively, why do you think that it's common in algorithms classes to teach it briefly? (FWIW, I have taught both crypto and algorithms classes before, so I'm absolutely interested in figuring out the right ways to teach them, and I also like to think my small amount of experience is relevant.) People who don't have formal training in algorithms are going to run across it and not understand why it's bad and implement it in software that real people end up using.  For reference, here's the person who wrote RSA in ECB mode who would have benefited from knowing what ""in ECB mode"" is and why it sucks (and also what hybrid encryption is), and here's a conversation from earlier today where someone assumed that full-disk encryption must decrypt the entire disk at once, matching your C = E(K, P) model.  By the way, I'm a bit worried about the concept of building constructions from building blocks, because real-world algorithms don't actually work like building blocks... if you're taught about random oracles, you're likely to fail to use HMAC when you should because you don't actually need HMAC's complexity if your hash is actually a random oracle."

CBC is one of such modes of operation. so you can not compare it to the core function, it is apples to oranges. to my knowledge, TDES supports CBC just fine if you follow the correct protocol, namely you choose unique IV.

This mode is called ECB, and is bad because if there are 2 identical blocks in your message, they'll have the same encrypted output. CBC intends to be a bit better at that by xoring the plaintext block N with the encrypted block N-1, creating a more ""pseudorandom"" result.

crypto,2ly371,Elyotna,1 point,Tue Nov 11 14:10:51 2014 UTC,"Block cipher mode of operation:       In cryptography, a mode of operation is an algorithm that uses a block cipher to provide an information service such as confidentiality or authenticity.  A block cipher by itself is only suitable for the secure cryptographic transformation (encryption or decryption) of one fixed-length group of bits called a block.  A mode of operation describes how to repeatedly apply a cipher's single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger than a block.     Most modes require a unique binary sequence, often called an initialization vector (IV), for each encryption operation. The IV has to be non-repeating and, for some modes, random as well. The initialization vector is used to ensure distinct ciphertexts are produced even when the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times independently with the same key.  Block ciphers have one or more block size(s), but during transformation the block size is always fixed. Block cipher modes operate on whole blocks and require that the last part of the data be padded to a full block if it is smaller than the current block size.  There are, however, modes that do not require padding because they effectively use a block cipher as a stream cipher.  Historically, encryption modes have been studied extensively in regard to their error propagation properties under various scenarios of data modification. Later development regarded integrity protection as an entirely separate cryptographic goal. Some modern modes of operation combine confidentiality and authenticity in an efficient way, and are known as authenticated encryption modes.

If the checksum algorithm is sufficiently secure then any modification to its inputs (i.e. the file contents of the update) will cause a change in the output (i.e. the hash). By signing the hash, the signer states that any data that yields this particular hash can be considered to originate from the signer. Whether the recipient trusts this assertion is up to the recipient, but usually the answer is ""yes"".  Edit: I didn't read your comment properly. My point is that sign(hash) is the standard way of doing things. If they don't sign their checksums then they are screwed."

That's probably what you should convince yourself of first. All 1s is simplest, but you could write down a corresponding output XOR for any given inputs.  Then all you're left with are the non-linear S-boxes. Modifying the message and the key in precisely this way means that the input to each S-box is identical between the two encryptions, so the output will be too and they can be ignored: ""m ^ k == (m ^ 1s) ^ (k ^ 1s)"".  The perturbation has to have every bit as one, otherwise the two patterns would get out of sync over the DES key schedule; if you used completely independent round keys you could probably come up with some more varied identities like this."
crypto,2leda4,FAPINATOR9KYOLO,4,Wed Nov 5 20:05:26 2014 UTC,"By perfect secrecy, if you mean the information-theoretic version i.e. Shannon secrecy, no pragmatic encryption scheme can achieve it, without having at least as much entropy in the key as in the plaintext (in which case, why not just share the plaintext the way you shared the key etc)  A more useful question is how deterministic encryption stacks up against more realistic definitions of security for symmetric schemes. A typically used notion is called IND-CPA security.  In the IND-CPA game, you are provided access to an oracle. At each turn, you get to provide the oracle two plaintexts of equal length. The oracle chooses either the first or the second (but always the same choice every turn), and returns to you the encrypted version of the plaintext. If you can guess which one the oracle is choosing before you issue q queries, you win.  It's easy to see why having deterministic encryption won't work under this model - simply keep the first query constant, and change the second one. If the ciphertext changes, the oracle must be picking the second one, if it doesn't it must be using the first.  Why is IND-CPA meaningful as a measure of security? Because intuitively, it guarantees that even if an attacker knew that only one of two possible messages are going to be sent (ATTACKATDAWN vs MAINTAINHOLD), they still can't tell which one you sent from looking at the ciphertext. In particular, they cannot determine if the message you sent now was the same as or different from any of the ones you sent previously."

You don't need to know as much information, but they are less powerful. A specific GUI has a more limited range of functionality, but makes that functionality more accessible, and requires less knowledge to operate.

crypto,2l9k1k,veggieSmoker,2,Tue Nov 4 14:59:41 2014 UTC,"Fingerprints can't be used for encryption, only authentication. For an encryption key, every single bit needs to be exactly correct, and must be the same each and every time. However a fingerprint can be dirty, you might get a cut, or you might have your finger at a slighly different angle each time. So it's really not a feasible solution as an encryption key.  So a phone (or computer of any sort) might require you to only enter an encryption key at boot time, and otherwise store it in memory but require authentication to access the phone.   The iPhone would (in some way) be caching the decryption key in hardware, which is why you can authenicate with the fingerprint and don't need to re-enter the pin. The issue of choosing EITHER device encryption OR an unlock password is purely an android limitation, and it is bad design because it makes the crypto very non-user-friendly. I believe this will change in the next version of Android."

TouchID certainly isn't as secure as using a strong device password, but makes an excellent balance between usability and security for most users -- most users find even a 4-digit PIN to be too much hassle.  The sorts of people who have such sensitive things to protect that TouchID wouldn't be sufficient ought not be using a stock-OS smartphone in the first place, or at least ought to have a sandbox on that phone that requires additional authentication to access."

The payout could be pretty good. A Raspberry Pi, camera module, and a few 64 GB memory sticks (costs maybe $150) and you've got high res video and it can log who has been there when and for how long over a week or so. Just let it log every detected face together with timestamp, then figure out which are the same faces. You can likely see what they have touched too if you place it right (staircases would be good, and other fairly large surfaces that are frequently touched where you likely can find some prints that are mostly intact).   <1h work per print (total effort / number of targeted devices) and a few hundred dollars in payout per successfully applied copied print. Not all that bad. And you can repeat it as often as you like, the most risky action is taking the phone (which is quick), placing and retrieving the camera and photographing surfaces with prints are much less risky.

Bernstein challenging restrictions on the export of cryptography from the United States.  The case was first brought in 1995, when Bernstein was a student at University of California, Berkeley, and wanted to publish a paper and associated source code on his Snuffle encryption system. Bernstein was represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who hired outside lawyer Cindy Cohn. After four years and one regulatory change, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that software source code was speech protected by the First Amendment and that the government's regulations preventing its publication were unconstitutional.  Regarding those regulations, the EFF states:  The government requested en banc review.   In Bernstein v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 192 F.3d 1308 (9th Cir. 1999), the Ninth Circuit ordered that this case be reheard by the en banc court, and withdrew the three-judge panel opinion, Bernstein v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 176 F.3d 1132 (9th Cir.1999).      Image i     Interesting: Daniel J. Bernstein | Junger v.

Here's a flow chart from the BIS: http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_view/328-flowchart-2  The first arrow is all that's relevant: if your software is under an open source license, you can self classify the software under License Exception TSU 740.13(e) and distribute it. All this requires is you notify the BIS, which can be done in an email. It's not very hard... He even posts it later in his quote, which is from the BIS:   Notification requirement. You must notify BIS and the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator via e-mail of the Internet location (e.g., URL or Internet address) of the publicly available encryption source code or provide each of them a copy of the publicly available encryption source code. If you update or modify the source code, you must also provide additional copies to each of them each time the cryptographic functionality of the source code is updated or modified. In addition, if you posted the source code on the Internet, you must notify BIS and the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator each time the Internet location is changed, but you are not required to notify them of updates or modifications made to the encryption source code at the previously notified location. In all instances, submit the notification or copy to crypt@bis.doc.gov and to enc@nsa.gov.   I honestly don't know why crypto nerds are suddenly flipping out about this news... none of these rules have changed in over a decade from what I can tell, and the burden for open source software is extremely low (even if I still think it's stupid) - the trick is Wind River (an Intel subsidiary) is being fined for exporting their work to places that the BIS has blacklisted for export (based on the classification of their product). That's a violation of the BIS's export regulations; of course it stands to reason they could get fined for such a violation. In fact, the reason the fine wasn't bigger is specifically because Wind River noticed this and voluntarily disclosed it to the BIS.  You're not going to get fined for posting stuff to GitHub; Wind River was fined for violating the export laws they had to uphold for their products. The burden for open source is so low it's pointless to go after."

crypto,2l6v08,electronics-engineer,2,Mon Nov 3 20:28:49 2014 UTC,"I posted this on the /r/programming discussion:  Here is an interesting question: for known number types, it should be fairly simple to back out the key of any data using homomorphic encryption I would think: For example, I have a field that I know is an integer (x). I can get 0, 1, and from that, every other integer pretty easily:  0 = x - x 1 = x / x 2... = 0 + 1 + 1...   Which means I can, rather trivially, back out every single value. What am I missing? How is homomorphic encryption not almost entirely useless?"
crypto,2l6v08,spotta,4,Tue Nov 4 01:42:58 2014 UTC,"You haven't posted your entire scheme, but I suspect when you say:  0 = x - x   You actually mean:   0 = Enc(1) - Enc(1)   Or in otherwords  Enc(1) = Enc(1)   Which is not true.  Homomorphic encryption of values is not determinisitc.  So if you have two unknown ciphertexts, C1 and C2, then the probability of them being equal is diminishingly small. More-over the computation C1 - C2 is rather meaningless - the ciphertexts are usually an encoding of a fixed with integer in some other form, you can't simply apply integer subtraction to the ciphertext and have that equate integer subtraction of the plaintext."
crypto,2l6v08,tom-md,3,Tue Nov 4 06:38:22 2014 UTC,"For example, I have a field that I know is an integer (x).    That statement already is confusing.  a Field is a set, F, with a closed addition operator  on F and a group under multiplication on (F - {0}).     I can get 0, 1, and from that, every other integer pretty easily:  0 = x - x  (Additive inverse in Z)  1 = x / x (Multiplicative inverse in Q)  2... = 0 + 1 + 1... (addition in Z)   Keep in mind the homorphic function you're using is the identity function f(x) = x. It's the most trivial homorphic function we have.  A homomorphism satifies the property f(x + y) = f(x) * f(y)  where the '+' is the additive operator on the domain and the '*' operator is the additive operator in the codomain.  I think that is what you are missing.  If none of that made sense to you, let me try to explain why it is useful and provide a use case.    It is useful because it allows us to modify encrypted data without ""knowing"" the content of the data.  and by ""knowing"" I mean that I don't know the actual value of the data, but I do know what type of data it is.  All encryption today except for the FHE (fully homomorphic encryption) schemes cannot do this.  If I modify the encrypted data, the original value is corrupted if I try to decrypt the modified encrypted data.    The traditional use case would be banking.  Here is the scenario.  I have X amount of dollars.  I encrypt X with my FHE, say f(X), and give f(X) to my bank.  The bank doesn't know how much I have.  Now let's say I want to go buy some Ice Cream for Y dollars (Assume Y < X).  I encrypt Y to f(Y) and give that to my bank.  the bank has f(X) and f(Y) and knows it can perform f(X) - f(Y). Without any knowledge of the value of Y or X, the bank has accounted for my purchase of Ice Cream in my bank account! by the homomorphic property, f(X) - f(Y) = f(X - Y).  I am the only one that knows how to decrypt f(X - Y) using my FHE scheme and I get my bank account balance after my Ice Cream transaction, X-Y.  That use case is awesome and scary at the same time.  If you're the account holder, it's awesome that no one else knows how much money you have.  It' scary if you're a bank because if every account were like this, you'd never know how much money you have in the accounts you manage which also means you don't know how much money you can lend out. It also means that governing bodies (e.g. the federal reserve, internal revenue service,etc.) doesn't know how much money is in the bank."

Sorry, I meant field in the database/element of data sense, not in the mathematical sense.  Though, by pure chance, it happens that machine integers are a field...  and no, I wasn't trying to talk about the identity homomorphic function.  What I was attempting to say is that I know that x-x is 0.  More formally, in your notation:  f(x-x) = f(x) * Inv(f(x)) = f(0).  Likewise for the multiplicative inverse.  Since I know what operations on the encrypted data map to what operations on the decrypted data (because this is a property of the encryption algorithm, but not the key), I can get things like the additive inverse and multiplicative inverse.  Once I can get these, I can rebuild the entire 'Field' (in the mathematical sense) of machine integers, which pretty much allows me to make the map from encrypted to unencrypted values, given nothing other than a single encrypted piece of data and the operations that I can do on it.  Check out the other responses to me in the cryptography subreddit and the programming subreddit for more information on how this problem is solved."
crypto,2l6v08,spotta,4,Tue Nov 4 04:58:50 2014 UTC,"Though, by pure chance, it happens that machine integers are a field...   The integers are not a field.  It's just a ring.   That's why I said:   1 = x / x  (Multiplicative inverse in Q)  f(x-x) = f(x) * Inv(f(x)) = f(0). Likewise for the multiplicative inverse.    Please be careful with the word inverse.  an inverse function implies that f is an injective function.  y in F is said to be a multiplicative inverse of x in F if x*y = id  (multiplicative identity, id is usually 1).  An inverse function and multiplicative inverse are two different things.  Looking at your comment on programming:   What I'm saying is that I don't need to get the decrypted output. If I am given a piece of encrypted data, and I know it is homomorphically encrypted, then I can do two operations to get the identity of addition (0) and the identity of multiplication (1). From these, I can reconstruct every element of the set of numbers representable by that data type (e.g. 1+1=2, 1+1+1=3, etc).   To avoid further confusion, let's make this very clear:  I don't need a field (or a ring) to use a homomorphism.  I just need a set and closure under addition.  I'm not going to continue any further with this."
crypto,2l6v08,throwaway0xFF00,2,Tue Nov 4 05:26:43 2014 UTC,"I think he's right, although that's a trivial consequence of additive homomorphism of encryption. By definition, if you  have two encrypted elements you can construct encryptions of any sum of them, this is intended.  Note that in full homomorphism however, AFAIK, you choose which operations to provide. If you provide ""/"" and ""-"", then given any non-zero encryption the third party can provide you an encryption of any value. He won't actually be able to decrypt your value if it is properly implemented with some kind of randomness, since he would have to check on average at least 2randomness-1 sums to see if a certain guess of what's your encryption is true (by constructing the integer for every value of the randomness) -- which of course is unfeasible for large randomness.  Thus the third party doesn't necessarily has that power (to generate an encryption of any value) if you don't provide necessary functions, so if you wanted him to compute f(x), you could just provide him a function of a kind (compute_f(x),add_counter), so in the end you check that he computed f(x), exactly once (instead of providing e.g. ""/"" and ""-"" and saying, plain text, ""Compute f(x)"")."
crypto,2l6v08,darkmighty,2,Tue Nov 4 10:54:49 2014 UTC,"No, he's saying more than that.  He is suggesting that because you can construct encryptions then you can trivially determine the plaintext value of a given ciphertext, which just isn't true and shows a painful lack of reading."

You can give the other party an encrypted container and a hash of the encryption key with a Zero-knowledge proof of that the container has the file in question. Then you both do this for your respective files, and then you take turns releasing parts of the key (also with corresponding Zero-knowledge proofs of correctness). Either both parties fulfill the protocol or somebody has to do expensive bruteforce. Maybe you'll release something like 40 bits at once, such that if one side drops out after getting the last 40 and the other side didn't get his last 40 bits, bruteforce is possible but still expensive. This could still be abused, but it reduced the risk. Note that one side could still chose to drop out early and chose to do bruteforce when they've got all but 40 bits and the other side still lacks 80 bits. You can also go for smaller pieces at each turn, but that has other security tradeoffs."

The BIOS password entry or pre-boot authentication typically only managed the user level; you need a management tool to use the administrator level.  If you don't manage the administrator level then you've probably left it in default configuration, which means you have no security. ""Some ISVs provide a one-time emergency unlock and recovery procedure"" -- TCG - Commonly Asked Questions and Answers on Self-encrypting Drives.  Or, by another name, ""no security"". As should be evident from the above points, the drive has access to the data encryption key via more than one route (user authorisation, admin authorisation, ISV authorisation).  OPAL doesn't specify how (cryptographically) this is achieved.  It has been suggested that some manufacturers don't protect the encryption key under an authorisation key/password, but rather just verify the password and then permit the use of the encryption key (which is stored in flash or on the drive, either in the clear or maybe protected by a static firmware keys - but that's all speculation because the manufacturers won't disclose the details of their implementation).  So, depending on your implementation, ""no security if your attacker can physically access flash or the disk platter(s)"". In some cases the consumer models of ""OPAL"" drives aren't OPAL, but just support the weaker ATA Security standard.   In short, you can't trust SED unless you have taken the time to understand the security characteristics and configuration requirements of your specific drive."

If you can't negotiate terms (such as an NDA) such that you (and/or the audit firm of your choice) can do an audit, you can't trust it.  Even if you want to make money off crypto software there's no reason to keep it proprietary: Keep the encrypting core an open library and call it with a proprietary application.

You forgot the word: brickyard   Did the script actually tell me the wrong forgotten word? Is this a bug?  There should really be a check to prevent bits < 10, which this scheme interprets as a 1 word passphrase and will not accept for verification.  Also, I kind of assumed the ""fudge"" factor would account for misspelled words or near-words like obtuse/obtain, but it doesn't. You'd literally need to ignore misspelled words as totally incorrect the way this is implemented. Wouldn't it be more prudent to have a distance threshold for arbitrary words?

crypto,2kzkgy,aydiosmio,1 point,Sun Nov 2 05:57:41 2014 UTC,"In this case, you supplied ""fallout"" as part of the password in place of obtuse. ""fallout"" is in the wordlist. When it calculates the checksum of ""bookseller fallout"", it sees that the checksum does not match ""pacific . So as to correct for this, it adds the word brickyard (because ""bookseller fallout brickyard"" has a checksum of ""pacific"".   So as to better explain how the error correction works:    First it goes through the supplied password and checksum looking for words that are not in the word list. When it finds a word that is not in the wordlist it calculates the Levenshtein distance of the supplied word from each word in the wordlist. Based off of this, the program finds the word that is the closest match.    E.g. you supply ""bookseller obtain"", it will correct that to ""bookseller obtuse"".   Second it takes the corrected string from the above and calculates the checksum of the string. Then it will compare the generated checksum to the supplied checksum. If they match, then no further work is done. If they do not match it then calculates what word needs to be added to it to make the checksums match. It then adds the word.    Good point on bits < 10, I'll add that check after this message. And you are correct, the ""fudge"" factor does account for misspelled words or near-words. What it does not account for, is deliberately different words.    E.g. The password should be ""bookseller obtuse"", when in reality the user enters ""bookseller fallout"". Due to ""obtuse ""and ""fallout"" not being at all similar, the program will not be able to correct for them.

Because if you don't, nothing anyone says is going to make any sense to you because it'll be a black box."
crypto,2ky72u,phyzome,4,Sat Nov 1 04:56:09 2014 UTC,"First of all, understanding what you're actually dealing with:  RSA is an asymmetric key algorithm. Instead of using one password to encrypt, it creates two keys, also known as a Keypair. The keys can only be used with each other, neither can be switched out and have the pair still work.  The way the Keypair works is that a messaged encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other key. A message encrypted with key A can only be decrypted with key B, and a message encrypted with key B can only be decrypted with key A.  The way people get a use out of this algorithm is to use it for Public Key Cryptography. One key is labeled the Public Key and the other is labeled the Private Key. The Public Key is given out to everyone. The Private Key is treated like a password and kept secret and safe. Since everyone has the Public Key, they can scramble a message with it and know that only the person who has the Private Key can unscramble the message.  In Public Key Cryptography, mixing a message with the Public Key is called encryption, and mixing a message with the Private Key is called signing or verification. Since the owner of the key is the only person with the Private Key, and everyone has access to the Public Key, anyone can use the Public Key to unscramble the message and see that the owner of the Private Key really did scramble it.  RSA is an mathematical algorithm for encryption. OpenPGP is a standard for the use of public and other key algorithms. Symantec PGP and GnuPG are software implementations of the OpenPGP standard.  gpg --export -a   will export the public key in ascii. Here's one for a Dummy key I made.  gpg --export-secret-key -a   will export the private key in ascii. Don't actually do this, i'm just doing it for demonstration. Here's the paste for the private key. You'll notice it's twice as long: This is because OpenPGP stores both keys in the Private Key block, so that the public key can be reacreated from the private one.  GnuPG stores two keyrings, a Public Keyring and a Private Keyring. You can see the public keyring by using  gpg --list-keys   Each key has a hexidecimal string called a Fingerprint, which is a unique identifier generated using the public key. They're a quick way of making sure everyone is using the same key. If you import that public key you should find a key called ""dummy"" with the fingerprint E01FF0D4 in your Public Keyring. If you want a more secure long-form fingerprint, use  gpg --list-fingerprints   Now I'm going to make a text file which just says ""hello world"". By using  gpg --clearsign hello.txt   I create a file called hello.txt.asc, which looks like this. You can see that it includes the message I was signing. A signed message isn't supposed to be secret, because the key used for unmixing is public.  In OpenPGP you can verify another user's key by signing their Public Key with your Private Key. If you know John Smith personally, and I know you personally, I can make sure my message to John can only be read by him by seeing who the people that I trust trust in turn. This is called the Web of Trust.  Public Keys are stored on Keyservers, which also store key signatures. OpenPGP is built to talk to those servers. You can sign John Smith's key by using  gpg --sign-key John Smith   and it will tell the Keyserver that you trust John Smith. Anyone asking the Keyserver for your key will also be told who you trust, and since you used your Private Key to do it, it will be cryptographically secure. The WOT is pretty much what PGP is for. This stuff is so powerful that US Customs filed an investigation of the creator of PGP for arms exportation.  It's important to understand the basics, but it can be stressful if you're not very savvy with the command line. I haven't used TAILS in a while, but Seahorse is a great GUI for GPG, and it was on TAILS last time I checked. Remember that TAILS will delete everything it did when it shuts down, so Private Keys on it won't be very useful unless you export them.  Hope that helped. Reply and I will go more in-depth. This is my favorite guide to PGP. The biggest thing is: find some local key-signing parties. Bitcoin meetups might also be a good place to look."

You could do two rounds, though. Every 6 rounds, it applies an ""FL"" transform.  You'd have to decide whether to include that in the reduced version or not.   Also, your research might not be entirely original, as there are already several papers on attacking reduced Camellia (see, eg, http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=reduced+round+cryptanalysis+of+camellia ).  That said, Camellia source code is not that hard to dig up and understand.  For example, there's a python implementation at http://omake.accense.com/browser/camellia/trunk/pycamellia.py  The ""feistel1"" function is 2 rounds of Camellia.  Pass it an x which has 4 32-bit words, and a k which has 4 32-bit words, and it will do one round.  Or truncate the EncryptBlock function after the first Feistel1 call (until the return statement) to include the prewhitening step.

I do wonder if the large password based sites couldn't go for a more sophisticated form of measuring the likelihood of a password instead of the usual cryptic x characters, y numbers, z special characters. For example, they could check the password against rainbow tables, or keep a list with hashes of most often used passwords on the website and require a different one, etc."

Any requirement would only limit the search space, so my n digit randomly generated password will be more secure on a site that enforces no minimum than the same password would be on a site that enforces some restrictions.

To become good at cryptography, eventually you will definitely need to follow /u/cancerfilter's advice, but these are easy to start with.  To create secure software (since you asked about cryptography software) you need to focus on how your software (including its dependencies, such as RNG or the C-library) interacts with its environment (other programs, the OS, the hardware). Every single interaction is important. To head down this path you need to at least learn low-level programming (ASM or C), OS-design and how the CPU works."

crypto,2krzwd,nocnocnode,2,Thu Oct 30 18:59:02 2014 UTC,"The evidence that NSA/NIST have backdoored ECC is very weak, and there are plenty of reasons to use it instead of, or in addition to, RSA.  In particular, it's very time-consuming to generate RSA keys, and it's also slow to decrypt or sign with them.  Applications which use ephemeral keys, or keys generated on constrained devices, will perform orders of magnitude better with ECC.  This is why eg TLS specifies DHE or ECDHE (the trailing E is for Ephemeral) for forward secrecy, but not any form of ephemeral RSA.  People use ECDHE instead of DHE because, again, it's at least an order of magnitude faster, and more as you go to higher security levels.  It is possible that NSA knows an attack against the NIST curves, or more likely, against every elliptic curve.  But the same thing is a concern for pretty much any cryptosystem.

(Yeah, there are definitely problems like it in this case, and as Matthew Green points out, there are approaches they could have taken to make their implementation more secure, but the system as a whole didn't exist before this implementation.)  Their problem was that they just handed it over to regular Joe Schmo software engineers with a copy of OpenSSL's source code in hand and not Ass Kicking Crypto software engineers. And worse, they went ahead and standardized their protocol without taking it to some independent agency for testing and validation.  Furthermore, this really should put the stink on the ISO standardization of any business process where there exists only one implementation. If the software hasn't been or can't reliably be reproduced by another company, who would have hopefully immediately pointed out some of these flaws they introduced, then it has no business being called a ""Standard.""

There is a more complicated technique for solving for x if only a few bits of k are known, requiring more signatures.  It is extremely important that all bits of k be unique, unpredictable, and secret. With two DSA signatures on separate messages with the same k, you can recover the signer’s private key.   i.e. If a few bits of your nonce are even a little-bit correlated, with enough messages, an attacker can recover the whole private key.

Crucially, a cheating player can potentially choose whether to abort AFTER seeing the revealed values of all other players. Also crucially, there could be a possibility for multiple players to collude with each other so that some SUBSET of the colluding players may abort after seeing the revealed values of all other players. (This is pretty much what I say also in my response in the lottery link above.)  Whether such an attack is a problem, and/or can be mitigated, depends very much on the particulars of your application as well as your model of (cheating) players' capabilities. There is a wide literature on secure distributed coin flipping, including the classic impossibility result Cleve 1986, Limits on the Security of Coin Flips When Half the Processors are Faulty. Upshot of that one: If you suspect that as many as half the players in your game may collude with each other, then they WILL be able to bias a heads/tails coin toss by some non-negligible amount no matter WHAT protocol you use."

crypto,2kgo7q,3pg,4,Wed Oct 29 18:31:31 2014 UTC,"This is very similar to Blum's coin tossing protocol which is about 30 years old. In fact, Blum's would probably be preferred. In that protocol, everyone commits to their own seed, then everyone opens, then the coin toss outcome is the xor of all the seeds. This way, if at least one person chooses a random seed, then the result is random.  This is fine for Tetris, since you just need to pick a random piece each time. The reason for more complicated techniques with poker is that poker has a secret state (the initial shuffled deck). Everyone has different partial information about  the secret state but all steps/outcomes of the game have to be consistent with it. In a poker game, no one should learn the seed that is used to generate the entire shuffled deck!"

A distributed PRNG is seeded with hash(sorted(seeds))   You don't need this; just sum them.  Even if you want to generate small numbers, the seeds have to be big enough that it's not possible to brute-force them, and the commit hashes have to be big enough that a player can't have a prepared collision.  Note that these two attacks have different efforts; a collision is sqrt(n), while the brute-force is n/k, where there are k opportunities to perform the attack.  One way to optimize many iterations of this is to have players pick a seed X, and publish hash100 (X).  Then they can each reveal hash99 (X), hash98 (X), etc. with each seed acting as the hash commitment for the next round."

crypto,2kcuy5,Theon,16,Sun Oct 26 08:41:33 2014 UTC,"The Socialist Millionaires' Protocol allows both parties to determine if they have the same shared secret without revealing it. In the case of OTR, the shared secret is the hash of the passphrase and the ""secure session id"" derived from the DH key exchange, among other things.  If an MITM attack is happening, both sides would have different secure session id's. The attacker knows both of them but cannot construct the correct shared secret because he does not know the passphrase."
crypto,2kcuy5,supersaw7,2,Sun Oct 26 11:30:28 2014 UTC,"I don't know the protocol, but I can quickly sketch both a wrong way and a right way to do this.  The wrong way is to just send the shared secret over the encrypted channel (equivalent to typing it in over the chat), which is vulnerable as you describe.  The right way is to use the shared secret to derive a signature for the encrypted channel's key. The signature itself should be designed to be public, in that it leaks neither the shared secret nor the encryption key. For instance, you could PBKDF2 (or something) the shared secret with a random salt to get a temporary HMAC key, and then use that to compute an HMAC of the encrypted channel's key. One side could send over the resulting HMAC (which leaks no information about its inputs) plus the salt, unencrypted, and the other side could verify it. A man-in-the-middle won't be able to generate the right HMAC key.  This is roughly the same way ephemeral (forward-secret) keys work in SSL. Both sides set up an encrypted, unauthenticated tunnel with a temporary key, and then the server signs some info about that temporary key with its long-term key, i.e., the one it has an SSL certificate for. The long-term key is never disclosed, and it's only ever used for signing, not encryption/decryption."
crypto,2kcuy5,ldpreload,1 point,Sun Oct 26 22:14:42 2014 UTC,"You are right in what you say.  What you are missing is that you are supposed to verify that the key ID (fingerprint) belongs to that person ahead of time, through some other channel.  What you say could certainly happen.  That's why you need to verify the fingerprint, usually in person or over the phone or something.  If it's an online person, have them message you from an account in a different forum to verify.  So you and I exchange OTR keys, then I shoot you a text/e-mail/phone call and tell you my key fingerprint, so you know that the key you got really is from me, and you do the same.  The nice thing is you only have to do that verification once.  But yes you do have to do that verification at least once in order to prevent exactly the type of thing your post outlines.  The only reason other forms of public key encryption might not have to do that is because they TRUST somebody else.  In HTTPS for example, it's still normal old public key crypto, but your computer and browser comes programmed ahead of time with the public keys of Certificate Authorities, so your browser sends a request to a trusted certificate authority, like VeriSign or something, and because you already have their public key, you can verify their response.  So you ask them for the public key of the website you want to visit, they give it to you, you trust them, and now you trust that the public key you have is the correct public key.  But that's only possible because you trust the authority to give you the right key, and also because you have the authority's key programmed in your computer ahead of time.  That's how websites get around needing to verify the key.  They still do need to verify it.  They just program your browser ahead of time with trust-worthy public keys of places that vouche for other keys."

If you don't MAC the whole drive, then an attacker can replace a block with an older authenticated block from the drive, which is no better than the current situation.  I personally think that authentication for disk encryption is a waste of time. Tweakable wide-block ciphers already provide most of the benefit i.e. making manipulation more difficult (which plain AES-CBC as used here is not very good at). These guys claim <2% degradation in IOPS with authentication, but that's on simulated flash, so YMMV. Maybe self-encrypting drives that offload the crypto onto an on-disk processor would help, but as I said before, tweakable block ciphers are already good enough.

crypto,2k5y0u,monican_agent,2,Fri Oct 24 03:32:42 2014 UTC,"Sounds like a fun project.  I was actually working on a website to implement one of proposed mental poker protocols(the paper I based my protocol on).  It was a bad idea for a lot of reasons, though I knew several of them going into it.  First, to do the crypto client side, I used javascript (Yeah, bad, I know), and then there is the fact that each shuffle required more than 10MB of traffic, so much more appropriate to LAN connections than a webpage.  I also decided to implement a dropout tolerant version which used a reshuffle (another 10+ MB) if anyone dropped out and a careful zero-knowledge flagging of already selected cards, which adds a lot of complexity to something that wasn't going to see the light of day anyway.  Without dropout tolerance I didn't feel comfortable supporting more than a 2-player game, since each player require critical information to flip the next card, so any player dropping out voids the entire hand. But the data traffic increases in proportion to the square of the number of players, so a 2-player only setup would've not been a terrible idea anyway.  Keep in mind the data usage may be a limiting factor and may make over the internet unrealistic.  I ended up abandoning my project because I got far enough into it that I could no longer put off developing the interface and UI work which just didn't interest me.  Anyway, you should be careful about which protocol you implement since a number of them have had subsequent papers that have shown flaws.  Also, many of the newer versions have had nice features, such as the dropout tolerance, and also added efficiency, which is a big deal considering the massive amount of traffic required for this algorithm, though might add complexity, which may not be worthwhile, depending on your goals.  Also, if you haven't seen this implementation, you might want to check it out.  As far as I can tell, the libtmcg is the only evidence I've found of someone actually creating an implementation of a mental poker protocol."
crypto,2k5y0u,AnythingApplied,2,Fri Oct 24 05:54:20 2014 UTC,"Thank you for your reply.  I agree that JavaScript in the browser is typically a less secure and more restrictive environment than if running the software as a protected native application. However, both may be vulnerable if their host environment has been compromised. To a certain degree this may be addressed by running the browser or application in a clean VM but that seems too burdensome for regular use. This is one of the reasons why I chose not to use JavaScript for the implementation, but the rudimentary implementation I mentioned is useful in other ways (Node.js, Cordova / PhoneGap, etc.) For browser-based JavaScript, securing keys and random number generation are a couple of pressing challenges that need to be addressed, but then again no environment is a panacea so I don't believe it should stop anyone from trying.  On the topic of implementations, I found the LibTMCG implementation as well as a Python implementation (deckgen) to be both incomplete and overly complex. A few other projects claiming to implement Mental Poker are either empty or in nascent stages. Being the most complete, however, LibTMCG does address the known weaknesses of the SRA cryptosystem - the ""leaky card"" and weak padding problems - which I also address in the Token Generation section.  As you mentioned, poorly designed or implemented protocols are the source of most of the other known security issues I've discovered in the literature, issues that I've worked to avoid in the Peer to Peer Poker Protocol while reducing complexity. I've also built in protections against side-channel attacks such as those used on the related RSA cryptosystem, and incorporated the lessons of recently exposed flaws such as Heartbleed.  It's not my intention to downplay the importance of addressing known weaknesses but I'm confident that what I've produced is quite solid. Besides being directly based on decades of sound research and being available as open source, a verification of the software via a secondary implementation, like JavaScript, will help to back these claims.   As much as I'd like to believe that I produce perfect code every time, the reality is that bugs will pop up from time to time. Anyone can address these in a fork of the code but I'm too invested in this project to let major problems lie idle. In this regard I'd like to thank you for bringing up the bandwidth issue; it's an important consideration.   CypherPoker uses a commutative cryptosystem as described in the original Mental Poker paper and which has many similarities to RSA. The data doesn't grow over time so it's possible to predict how much information we can expect to exchange in a variety of scenarios.  -Assuming a very strong crypto byte (CB) length of 512, or 4096 bits, the raw data requirement for a 52-card deck is exactly 26,624 bytes. If we add a generous 3,376 bytes for protocol metadata we can assume 30 KB for the whole deck or roughly 4 KB  per card if transmitted independently, which we try to avoid.  -With 8 participants, the full deck is initially transmitted 8 times requiring a total 240 KB of data to be exchanged. We add two additional dealer messages to this, one to share the plaintext mappings (TPs) and one to share P - 30,000 and 4,000 bytes. This brings the total data requirement for the initial deal to 274,000 bytes, which means roughly 35 KB of data exchanged by every participant. In fact the requirement for the dealer is a little higher while for the players it's slightly less, but this marginal burden is shared during subsequent rounds of play and will approach the average as the dealer role is shifted towards the final player.  -Only cards being selected for play are transmitted once the deck is encrypted. Individual card operations based on the 4 KB size average will require 32 KB of data to be transmitted for a full decryption. At 512 bytes per card and including 3,376 for overhead, a single communication containing 2 cards will be 4.4 KB. At 3 cards, the message size increases to 4.9 KB.  For a typical game 3 + 1 + 1 community cards (4.9 KB + 4 KB + 4 KB) are selected and 2 private cards (4.4 KB) are selected per player. Because we have 8 participants, every operation must be carried out 8 times. For community card selection this requires roughly 103 KB and all private cards require roughly 282 KB of data to be transmitted.  -Beside cryptographic operations there are also numerous betting, status, and other message exchanges between players. These are typically much smaller, even at an inflated average size of 1 KB. If we assume a healthy average of 30 realtime updates per participant prior to and during each betting round we can expect approximately 180 messages for a full game. In total, this means an additional 180 KB per player, or 1.44 MB for all 8 players.  Putting this all together, a full round of CypherPoker played at a very high CB length of 512, or 4096 bits, between 8 players requires about 2.1 MB of data: 274 KB to generate the deck + 385 KB for card selection + 1.44 MB for other messages.  Reducing either the CB length or the number of participants reduces this data requirement, as does minimizing realtime exchanges such as betting messages, and optimizing the message format (for example, the metadata).  If we assume that an average round lasts 5 minutes using the pessimistic 2.1 MB value, a participant should be able to maintain a sustained average transfer speed of 7 KB or 56 kilobits per second. Roughly 1.8 MB of that data will be downstream and 263 KB will be upstream.  After an hour the 8 participants will have exchanged just over 25 MB of data, an average of 3.2 MB per participant. It's difficult to predict the exact data requirements but even with the high CB length I believe these values are reasonable. With optimization they can be even better.  Efficiency of the cryptosystem is also a concern I share. From inception it was designed to be dynamically multi-threaded and cooperative. Each peer shares equally in the work of multi-party computations such as encryption or decryption. Improvements in path creation, the order in which the computations are done, could also increase efficiency.   The biggest problem with SRA is the startup time when the CB length is high. If we use a strong length of 256 (2048 bits), the time needed to find the true prime, P, can easily be in excess of 2 minutes. Even at CB length 128 (1024 bits), finding P takes unacceptably long. Furthermore, this doesn't take into account the generation of the plaintext tokens, TPs, and subsequent multi-party encryption.  Luckily there are two properties of the cryptosystem that allow these issues to be overcome. First, the encryption and decryption operations are both multi-threaded and relatively efficient. Second, since the plaintext tokens, TPs, are are derived using the prime, P, and since both TPs and P are shared publicly they can be pre-computed. Instead of sharing P, the dealer only needs to share an index to a known CB-length P value (with associated with TPs) that participants map locally. A 10 to 15 second startup time, for example, can be reduced to as little as 5 to 7 seconds. This also has the added benefit of slightly reducing the initial data size requirements.  When such optimizations are combined with a robust status reporting system and the ability of players to concurrently engage in other activities, the software becomes viable.  Finally, as you mentioned dropout handling is a must if we want to support more than 2 players. However, since this is described in the Peer to Peer Protocol section I'll save that discussion until it's been posted.  Thanks for your comments."

WEP, in comparison, merely concatenated the initialization vector to the root key, and passed this value to the RC4 routine. This permitted the vast majority of the RC4 based WEP related key attacks.  Second, WPA implements a sequence counter to protect against replay attacks.

There is a range of solutions that leak various amounts of metadata (word frequencies, search term intersections, search result intersections, etc.).  If you searched for ""cats"" twice in a row, is it okay let the server know that this occurred?  A true zero-knowledge solution should say no.  If you searched for ""cats"" and you searched for ""dogs"", and both of them happen to appear in some document 14, is it okay that the server knows that you made two distinct searches and document 14 both pop up?  A true zero-knowledge solution should say no.  However, we live in the practical world, and we might say yes to some of these things for the sake of practicality.  I believe the best you can get in terms of trading off privacy for efficiency is CryptDB, which has already been implemented and Google I believe also uses it.  http://css.csail.mit.edu/cryptdb/  https://code.google.com/p/encrypted-bigquery-client/  If you want absolute metadata privacy except for, say, what can just be measured by bandwidth alone, you probably have to give up efficiency and 10 billion sounds too big for current methods.

I'm sure there's a way to do it with zero-knowledge but it probably requires fetching every file so that the server assumes the keywords belong to each document. At which point, what is the point of server side search?  Here is a good starting point.  I don't know much about the topic, but there's a lot of implications with searchable encryption, and to do it practically you need to ensure minimal leakage (to the server). The more leakage, the more information a server has to reconstruct a document from keywords.  I don't really know much else on the topic.

If you are able to simply search for keywords, then this is actually much easier. Keep a list of hashes of the keywords associated with each item in the table near the item. I suggest doing a hash of something like hash(filename + keyword). Then when you need to do a search, just hash the search (or each term of the search) with each filename.   The reason you want to do this instead of just hashing the keyword is that an attacker could match up keywords if it were simply hash(keyword).  This will be quite expensive per-search, but if you're considering homomorphic encryption, this will likely be much more feasible. Some of the cost can also be mitigated with request caching.  If you wanted some extra protection, you could do hash(filename + hash(keyword)). Then the user would simply have to send hash(keyword). This would provide the extra benefit of not having to send keywords cleartext. It also means that you could keep a cache of request responses by hash instead of by keyword, reducing computation and increasing responsiveness."

Learn More About DevTalk -> http://bittext.ch/TUanG8v8wF Message ostensibly from Atheros (BM-GteJMPqvHRUdUHHa1u7dtYnfDaH5ogeY) Wed, 2014-10-01 21:26:28 UTC  Hello everyone, You may be aware that we have been working on Protocol v3: https://bitmessage.org/forum/index.php?topic=4067.0 It should be ready to release. A forum user named Thomas is running several nodes which will redo the POWs of objects and broadcast them on the opposite network in order to facilitate an upgrade period. It could not keep up during the spam flooding but should be able to for the time being now that it has stopped or paused. The two networks are the v2 network and the v3 network. I propose that I broadcast an announcement of the release this week and have the actual release next week. The upgrade period would then run through Sun, 16 Nov 2014 22:00:00 GMT. I can create a release candidate before next week for people here to test. Are there any objections to this plan? I would be happy to answer questions.  Here is what my announcement will likely say: <announcement> Bitmessage v0.4.4 will be available next week. It will be a required release; you must upgrade sometime before 16 Nov 2014.   This release contains a major protocol upgrade which accomplishes several goals: - Support user-specifiable message expiration time rather than the current two-day setting. Users will be able to specify the length of time a message should be held by the network from several minutes to 28 days. Messages with a longer time-to-live will require more work to send while messages with a shorter time-to-live will be easier to send. - Simplification of the various object types and signing schemes which will make implementing alternative clients easier. - Support for future object types even through older nodes.  - Cap the maximum message size at 256 KiB.   There isn't yet any user-interface to specify the time-to-live of a message; this will be added after the upgrade period. This release does contain a new feature which can be used immediately: the ability to limit the network transfer rate. Note that message acknowledgments will be broken until both parties upgrade so we recommend that everyone upgrade sooner rather than later. Interested individuals may review the source code ahead of time here: https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage/commits/ProtoV3  Thank You, Atheros </announcement>"

In that world, I wonder if the FBI directory be satisfied with a service that works as follows:   In order to access someone's encrypted data, including phone calls, a judge must cryptographically sign an order to be given to a consortium of trusted, non-governmental third parties.  These parties operate a threshold decryption scheme on HSMs which are airgapped, or as close to airgapped as possible. The order would include information about what communications can be tapped, how long the order will last, and how long it must remain secret.  Secret wiretap orders must be periodically reviewed, or they automatically become public. Anyone who was subject to a wiretap would be notified of the full details once the order is no longer secret.

Even saying you created a completely independent Citizen Privacy Advocates office, and gave them one of the keys, both they and the telcos are likely to bend to sufficiently strong government pressure as we saw in post-9/11.  A bigger and more complicated question is what about non US devices - who gets to hold the WORLD'S golden keys?

Terrorism or crime occurs when one person decides to commit a terrorist/criminal act. The act of communicating is not a terrorist act. There's a thing called freedom of association.

Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interferences or attacks.   Emphasis mine.  The word ""arbitrary"" is important here, and to determine its meaning you should compare its use throughout the document:  Article 9:   No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.   Article 15:   No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality.   Article 17.2:   No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.   These are the only rights which are guaranteed only against arbitrary interference.  The intent is clearly not to outright forbid arrest, detention, exile, revocation of citizenship, or taking of property; but instead that some appropriate legal process must be followed in order to do so.  See also ICCPR article 17.1:   No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.   and ECHR article 8, which personally I think is too friendly to surveillance:   (1) Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. (2) There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except as in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health of morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."

I strongly prefer to design cryptographic algorithms into perfection, either alone or with feedback from colleagues/experts, rather than to figure out which trick an author wants you to use to break a particular cipher. If nothing else, weak ciphers make me feel bad while strong ciphers are beautiful.  A good way to learn for people who prefer building is to study the works of masters (e.g. from IACR) while building own ciphers on the side. Sure, they need to be tested eventually, but it is possible to understand the effect of attacks without implementing them yourself. After all, attacks are just glorified statistics (no offense to cryptanalysts out there)."

You were obliged to obtain key material and the S-Boxes (substitution tables) from an organisation called FAPSI which was a state organisation that was spun off from the 16th directorate of the KGB. This organisation was later merged back into the FSB and SVR.  If you are in an organisation regulated by the Central Bank of Russia, i.e. a deposit taking financial institution you may implement encryption on the basis that you must keep an audit trail of your communications that can be inspected by the authority. So a person using https to communicate with a Russian bank is fine. The Central Bank of Russia was using PGP electronic signatures for a while in the nineties.  If you access an website with https, another rule comes into play, the infamous SORM-2 and 3. Essentially all Russian providers are obliged to install a special box between their gateway and webservers that would permit the FSB to intercept the communications.  In my own opinion, I doubt they did much with this in the early days as the FSB lacked the capability to process so much data, neither in expertise nor equipment. Today they have more money, so it could well have changed, especially if they get competent IT people doing their compulsory national service.

Look into HMAC, which is a way of converting a standard hash function like SHA256 into a MAC.  Encrypting a traditional checksum isn't going to cut it, because standard encryption algorithms are malleable. For example, if you encrypted a checksum using CTR mode, I could flip bits in the ciphertext, and this would flip the corresponding bits in the plaintext checksum. I could do a similar thing with the IV if you used CBC. Don't try to solve these problems yourself, you'll likely end up with something insecure that you don't know is insecure. Just use HMAC.  Edit: Are you only computing the checksum of the ID, or are you doing the checksum of the ID + message? My answer assumed the latter. If you meant the former, then I would strongly urge you to reconsider, as you'll leave yourself open to MITM attacks where an attacker leaves the ID and checksum intact but changes the message. If you are absolutely certain that you aren't worried about this scenario, and you're sure IDs will never repeat, and your server is configured to reject a repeated ID, then this is a corner-case where you can actually get away with padding the (fixed length) ID up to the block size of AES (128 bits), encrypting it, and taking the first n bits as your MAC.

In the case I was forcibly made to decrypt, I would decrypt the content from the internet.   Although, that is just what I assume the most common case to be. Another potential usecase is spreading a file publicly, then giving specific people specific passwords based on what you want them to see from it. (So maybe you have added a ton of files relevant to something, but you only want certain people at differing times to know what is in it)... etc.   The main draw is the file format; not the section encryption, I think aes-ctr could work with some small tweaks.

This might be different/nonexistent terminology but just what I use to describe it.   Since sha-256 is effectively a prng we then feed the results of each run back into sha-256 again, refreshing our 16X32u8 array. This is done as many times as necessary ie ceil(size_of_input / 32).  from what I understand xor'ing a number with 16 random numbers will prevent frequency analysis due to computational feasibility. This might fall apart when used on ridiculously large input files.  But, like I said I'm new so maybe I am completely off here. Hopefully my disclaimer is effective regarding this.    ps: that being said, you are correct that knowing correct terminology, notation, etc would be useful.

This might fall apart when used on ridiculously large input files.   Your understanding, insomuch as you can communicate it to others, is severely lacking.  XORing a sequence of bytes with an identical number of truly random bytes produces an output with perfect secrecy; this means that the output actually contains no information about the original input, other than its length. XORing a sequence of bytes with an identical number of bytes generated pseudorandomly may produce an output with computational security (where information about the original input is present, but computationally infeasible to recover). However, the details of doing so are critically important and misapplications of the primitives can trivially result in computationally recoverable outputs."

Say that on top of this, not only is sha256 reduced to binary, but it is reduced to the square root of itself... we are now left with 1/256.   That is why I came to 16 streams.

If we could get a quantum computer that can do as many calculations per second as the fastest supercomputers today, we could probably start talking about breaking 128 bit.

An ideal cryptographic hash is meant to be like a random mapping from the input to the output.  Because the output is a fixed length and the input can usually be any length, there will necessarily be ""collisions"" due to the pidgeonhole principle.  The idea is to have an output that is long enough to make the complexity of finding collisions ""infeasible"".  When this condition is met, the hash can be used in things like digital signatures and other protocols.  So hash functions are a very important type of cryptographic primitive."

It is often used as a signature to verify that data hasn't been changed.  Suppose Bob wants to send you a very large message but he only has enough time to send you a small fraction of the actual message. Bob can post the information somewhere public and send you a link to its location and the hash of the message.  You can then go retrieve the information (as can anyone else) and you can verify that the message you downloaded hasn't changed from what Bob uploaded by comparing the hash value Bob gave you with the hash value of the message you received.  This operation can only tell you ""yes/no, was this data modified?"" It cannot tell you what was modified, by whom, or when."

So the message is not reversible from the hash code, but the authenticity could be checked by the method of adding all numbers. I could only guess that hashing methods are far more complex than that as it needs to be injective function, and 45 in this case represents other sequences as well. Is that correct?"
crypto,2inhmk,12090205182025,2,Wed Oct 8 14:24:23 2014 UTC,"Yes, but a feature of a very good has is that it has to be extremely difficult for someone to modify your data then force it to hash to the same value (thus concealing the change)  Suppose Alice wanted to sow some distrust, she could alter the message to be ""192837456"", which would still sum to the same value but wouldn't be the same message. But, as a very simple hash, you are correct.  MD5 (a very common hash used for signatures) is 128 bits. Regardless of the input size, the has MUST be 16-bytes (128 bits), therefore we can conclude that some items MUST share a MD5 hash value. The crux of hashing is that given an input, the amount of time required to find another input that produces the same hash value is generally longer than the usable life of the input."

Think of it like taking an arbitrary amount of data, mashing it up with itself a lot, but in such a way that you end with a number of a fixed size in the end. In the case of SHA-256, that number is 256 bits long. By design it's hard to reverse and it's also hard to find collisions (two inputs that have the same output).   Hashes are used for integrity verification. For example, you could download a Linux image and then check its hash against the one posted on the website. If they match, you know that your copy is perfect intact and isn't corrupted.   In Bitcoin's case, hashing is used for integrity of the blockchain, but in a special way. It poses the question to find a hash of a random number and some data such that the hash result is less than a certain number. The only way to do this is by trying a lot of random numbers until you find one that answers the problem. That's hard to do, but easy to verify by a single hash. The people that do this work are called miners. If a miner succeeds in finding the answer, his block containing recent transactions is added to the blockchain. Once it is, it's stuck. I can't modify a transaction without changing the hash, and the hash can't be changed because then the block would be invalid."

If you get the program from someone other than me, or even if you try to get it from me and someone man-in-the-middle swaps it with something else, you can verify the program was unchanged because the odds of someone changing anything about the program and getting the same has are next to nothing.

Yes: there are various assumptions underlying the strength of crypto, like factoring being difficult. (We haven't proven that the only way to break e.g. RSA is factoring, but we do know that efficient factoring will definitely break it.)  Some things won't be broken, but not enough that we yet have practice building something like SSL out of so-called ""post-quantum"" mechanisms. From pqcrypto.org:   Here's the one-minute introduction: ""Imagine that it's fifteen years from now. Somebody announces that he's built a large quantum computer. RSA is dead. DSA is dead. Elliptic curves, hyperelliptic curves, class groups, whatever, dead, dead, dead. So users are going to run around screaming and say 'Oh my God, what do we do?' Well, we still have secret-key cryptography, and we still have some public-key systems. There's hash trees. There's NTRU. There's McEliece. There's multivariate-quadratic systems. But we need more experience with these. We need algorithms. We need paddings, like OAEP. We need protocols. We need software, working software for these systems. We need speedups. We need to know what kind of key sizes to use. So come to PQCrypto and figure these things out before somebody builds a quantum computer.""   2: Is it realistic that a quantum computer will be built? Maybe, maybe not, and that's more a question for the physicists, and for the quantum engineers whenever that career field happens to exist. D-Wave is the main commercial entity working on this, and so far they haven't been able to provide convincing proof whether their quantum computer is running faster than a classical one (which is to say, whether quantum mechanics is even relevant, or whether they just have a ridiculously complicated classical computer). So far, the academics have managed to factor the number 143 with a quantum computer, which is incredibly cool but a long way off from factoring anything of cryptographic size. Compared to classical computing, we're probably somewhere between the 1800s and 1940s; knowing how close were are beyond that is marketing hype, and there's a decent chance that the whole thing might not work out for some complicated physics reason.

crypto,2ikusy,jpverkamp,20,Tue Oct 7 18:43:06 2014 UTC,"Special note to law-enforcement agents: The word ""state"" is a technical term in cryptography. Typical hash-based signature schemes need to record information, called ""state"", after every signature. Google's Adam Langley refers to this as a ""huge foot-cannon"" from a security perspective. By saying ""eliminate the state"" we are advocating a security improvement, namely adopting signature schemes that do not need to record information after every signature. We are not talking about eliminating other types of states. We love most states, especially yours! Also, ""hash"" is another technical term and has nothing to do with cannabis."

crypto,2ikusy,DoWhile,3,Wed Oct 8 03:08:59 2014 UTC,"I don't fully comprehend hash-based signature schemes and this paper is a bit out of my depth. I have a few questions if anyone would be willing to clarify:  Using SPHINCS-256 (the implementation specified in the paper), are the number of leaves in the hypertree equal to the total possible signatures that can be made?  What is the theoretical limit of signatures that can be made without compromising the 128-bit security offered?"
crypto,2ikusy,cunttard,2,Tue Oct 7 22:23:48 2014 UTC,"Sad no one responded till now.  The security degrades somewhat gracefully even if your are unlucky unlucky. The number of leaves in the hyper-tree match how distinct few-time-usable-signature keys there are. As the name implies, you can safely reuse a few-time-usable-signature key more than once, but the security goes down the more you use it.  As far as the actual security goes it depends if you mean 128 bit pre-quantum or post-quantum security. Lets take the post quantum case, since thats the harder one to meet, and 128-bit quantum security is what the system targets.  For 250 messages with their proposed settings you have a 2-9.5  probability of being exposed to a 2134 quantum attack. There is a list in the paper:  Chance:  [2-41, 2-61,  2-75, 2-88,  2-102, 2-116, 2-130]  Quantum cost:  [2125, 2122.8, 2120.6, 2118.6, 2116.8, 2115.1, 2113.5]  At 260 messages signed, you end up with exposed to a 2100 attack with probability 2-30.  The authors argue that if you had your key on enough devices to sign 220 messages per second it would still take you 30 years to get to 250 messages used above.  [Personally, I dunno why anyone wouldn't also run a EC signature in parallel with Sphincs, another 64 bytes would add practically noting to the signature size, and would probably let you justifiably use smaller sphincs signatures since your pre-quantum security would remain good even with high reuse.]"

In particular, while it does seem buggy that your smaller prime is 511 bits, this shouldn't reduce the effective strength of the key beyond that of a 511+511-bit key, and a 1022-bit key is going to be just about as secure as a 1024-bit one, for all practical purposes.

Second, there's absolutely nothing wrong with bitsp=513 and bitsq=511.  bitsp=400 and bitsq=624 would be fine for security.

crypto,2iaumn,aydiosmio,1 point,Sat Oct 4 22:38:36 2014 UTC,"While sometimes desirable, indistinguishability from random noise is not required for a secure cryptosystem. It's merely helpful for deniability.  Most proper block cipher modes are designed to prevent information about the plaintext (like precise length, separators, static content) from leaking. This usually ends up making the ciphertext indistinguishable from random noise because random initialization vectors are used, or a counter causes each ciphertext to inherit a cascade which causes the output to appear random.  There's virtually no way to test with such a small sample. Unless the message has a word-for-byte substitution (making a repeating set of 256 words obvious), it's a huge undertaking to establish the encoding method. You'll always just do a binary block encryption, then choose an encoding mode to hide the encrypted data."
crypto,2iaumn,3pg,1 point,Sun Oct 5 09:10:16 2014 UTC,"Being indistinguishable from random noise (within a well specified margin) is a requirement for a cryptosystem to be considered secure in the random oracle model.  It does not, however, help you with deniability. Since it is possible to see that you are transmitting random noise then it is safe to assume that (since there's no point in sending noise) it is actually encrypted data.  I do agree with your final point. Once the data has been encrypted, it can be mapped to any representation of it, including representing each value with a word. The mapping chosen has no effect on the security of the encryption used to generate the input to the mapping function."

If a query is repeated it responds the same way every time that query is submitted.  Stated differently, a random oracle is a random mathematical function, that is, a function mapping each possible query to a (fixed) random response from its output domain.  Random oracles are a mathematical abstraction used in cryptographic proofs. They are typically used when the cryptographic hash functions in the method cannot be proven to possess the mathematical properties required by the proof. A system that is proven secure when every hash function is replaced by a random oracle is described as being secure in the random oracle model, as opposed to secure in the standard model.

The inversion steps in ECDSA are complex and completely unnecessary.  They are also a target for side channel attacks. The hashing/challenge scheme in EdDSA makes it clear why the system is secure, and leads to a security argument in the ROM; the completely ad-hoc challenge in ECDSA does not. EdDSA does not require collision resistance. EdDSA is faster because it uses Edwards curves."

My research team has published a paper, PRISM (the name has no link with the NSA program), that does this.  The idea is the following : - you say ""hey server ! create a matrix, hash each word (public hash fn) in the file and each time you put a 1 at this address in the matrix "". - say you want to search for the word ""house"". You hash it and perform a PIR on that matrix, targetting the position corresponding to the hash you got. - if you obtain a 1, the document does contain the word ""house"", else it does not. However the Server has no idea which word you were looking for. For big matrices (big possible words domain) performing PIR is more efficient than downloading the whole matrix."

The problem I see is that you can input garbage and have AES decrypt it.
crypto,2hrykh,cunttard,2,Wed Oct 1 03:21:01 2014 UTC,What are the assumptions for this attack? Is the password in the loader somewhere?  Does the user enter the password 50 times so that the attacker can analyze the power levels?  How would it be implemented in the real world? Secretly put a device on a CPU and monitor power levels without the user knowing?
crypto,2hrykh,nwad15,3,Mon Sep 29 17:02:28 2014 UTC,Who said anything about a password?  This is an encrypted bootloader and a secret key stored somewhere in an embedded device.
crypto,2hrykh,tom-md,3,Mon Sep 29 20:26:53 2014 UTC,"Anyone with more knowledge, feel free to correct what I'm about to say (it is probably wrong). What I say below is in the context of a microcontroller.  An encrypted bootloader is the (one of the) first executable which loads in a system. Encryption protects the bootloader code from being inspected in plaintext and probably prevents unauthorised firmware updates (probably need to set debug locks).  A bootloader can be stored in non-volatile RAM, ROM, or loaded via JTAG, USB, or some other form. I suspect in this article garbage data was sent in the guise of an encrypted bootloader, which was first decrypted, but later fails the signature check. This was sufficient to perform side channel analysis.  I felt the article didn't touch on the function of an encrypted bootloader for the sake of brevity."

I'm going to propose some changes to that page (http://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/sample-ecdsa.html ) where it could provide both PEM openssl friendly and Hex jsrsasign friendly versions for clarity. I ended up being able to utilize a combination of +/u/GahMatar KEYUTIL.getPEM( ) approach with the openssl -text approach to get a good solution.

So for example, let's look at the first two bytes of your private key: ""43a0"". Since this is ASCII encoded, those two bytes' worth of data are actually stored as four ASCII bytes: 0x34336130  So you need to find a way to read in that ASCII-encoded string, convert it into a long native value (that is, store it as 0x43a0…, not 0x34336130…), and then take that native value and base64-encode it.  If you try to base64-encode the ASCII-encoded hex, you'll end up with something completely wrong and twice as long as it should be."

I think the most relevant is the line of works connecting average-case-worst-case lattice problems.  Of course in creating lattice-based crypto, people tend to use a somewhat-equivalent, but more useful variants of lattice assumptions such as LWE or SIS.  There was also this recent paper in CRYPTO this year by Lenstra-Silverberg on extending the Gentry-Szydlo algorithm to attack certain potential constructions on certain ideal lattices with symmetry.  What I'm trying to say is that the landscape of both lattices and ideal lattices in crypto is quite complex, and understanding the fine line between the (sub-)exponential hardness levels is, as some people say, ""black magic"".  Don't be discouraged though, this is a very worthy subject to study as there are still some big open problems (such as creating multilinear-ish maps from straight LWE)."

The reason for my question is exactly that i Looked at Regevs, Peikerts, Micciancios etc work on connecting average-case-worst-case lattice problems. The security of LWE and SIS is based on reductions to worst case lattice problems (approximatively within poly factors), and that's why I'm interested in the complexity of these underlying lattice problems for different approximation factors.   Regev made a survey in 2007 (http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~regev/papers/lll.pdf) gathering results of the complexity of these problems. What i'm looking for is something similar to this, just including results up until now.  Cheers"

The problem with browser based crypto is, that the code that does the crypto comes from one entity, which is the entity you need to trust. The trap when thinking about this is to think that since the code is running on your machine, that you are doing the encryption; but that is not actually what's happening. Instead, the trusted entity runs code on your computer through javascript. This entity still does the encryption and merely lets your computer do the calculation.  The problem with this is, that you need to trust this entity to deliver correct code. This is normally done using SSL certificates in your browser; which also encrypts any communication from you to the trusted entity.  Let's look at the attack scenarios:   An attacker compromises your machine: System is broken An attacker manages to do MITM - in this case, the attacker needs to forge/control the SSL certificate. From this point on, the attack can deliver whatever code he wants. An attacker manages to compromise the trusted entity before or during communication; again they can deliver whatever JS-code they want. An attacker manages to compromise the trusted entity after communication: This is only safe, if the data that the trusted entity recieved is stored safely. But the code for this came in the javascript code - so you trust your entity to write good code. But then, they could as well just do the secure code handling after normal SSL delivered the data to them.   I don't see a scenario where running js-code in your browser does you any good compared to SSL."

Well, I need to check the signature on the certificate and get some kind of result (like your web browser ""lock"" icon).  How do I check the signature?  I use crypto to validate that it was created by the correct public/private keypair.  What private key?  Well, we're back to something that gets stored in a safe once more, and we've added one heck of a lot of complexity."

Instantly-on, batteries will die, switches will be turned off, the longer it takes to rejoin a net and renegotiate sessions, the longer a sub-unit is effectively cut off from C&C. Resilient. The more protocol overhead, negotiations and hierarchical systems are involved, the more things can break, be jammed, fail, run out of power or get disabled through enemy action (i.e.: get killed.) Autonomous. The battlefield is an highly hostile environment, terrain, weather, ECM, ECCM, Jamming, lack of power, long-range. Ideally a net should be establishable given any 2 radios being in range of each other. There can't be reliance on masters, repeaters, etc. Disposable. Equipement will be lost, captured, broken. There should be as little value in the gear as possible and the crypto variable, even if captured intact, should stop being usable as soon as possible.   I'm probably forgetting things. And that's just Army-types requirements. NSA-types requirements will include making sure the crypto variables are used for as short a period as possible and any crypto variables used over the air for broadcast will get the shortest period they can get. Can you just imagine the nightmare of re-issuing certificates every day?  By contrast loading key material into a SINCGARS takes a few seconds. Plug fill device, press button, done.  Even with an embedded CA in firmware, how do you control need to know or limit key material distribution? And the CA root ends up being a perpetual crypto variable who's loss is eventually guaranteed and who's value if broken is huge. An NSA crypto-nerds' nightmare. Once you have to load CAs into radios, you might as well just load a key-wrapping symmetric key instead. The ciphers are stronger and you'll be replacing it very frequently anyway. Plus the keys are smaller so easier to reliably enter manually when there's no alternatives (which can happen surprisingly quickly when you're being shot at.)  Almost forgot: It has to be backwards compatible between all models. Breaking backwards compatibility means a large scale replacement and retraining program. The crypto was integrated in 1990.

The military still doesn't trust public-key because the discrete logarithm problem is not proven (and this was designed during RSA days, not even DH kex). I could see them going with ECC if we have more proof, but they're cautious to put it mildly. More likely they'll switch to a hybrid system, keep the old but add a new layer of crypto on top.

In the US, using Tor of itself isn't cause for arrest/sanction by the government: but it can be part of justification for surveilling you if there are other reasons that trigger suspicion.  For the average user just protecting their privacy, though (and not trying to hide illegal activities), using Tor shouldn't get you hassled--and using Tor relays and such can get you around much of the Tor-detection capabilities.   Don't think that a VPN provides you with any anonymity, though.   Privacy VPNs, like Tor, can provide a level of anonymity if they're used properly. A privacy VPN provides very little defense against a State-level attacker, but it can actually be quite useful against other attackers, such as passive eavesdroppers on public networks.

Possible realities:   Apple works with independent security contractors to create backdoors and what those contractors do with governments is not disclosed.

Such a rush might be warranted in the face of a new, serious attack on SHA-1. But has this occurred - and if it had, the sunset period would be way too long anyway!  I guess the surprising point is, that when Google announced this, I would have expected to be able to be able to look to Google's own web site to see how they implemented it. Specifically I was curious to see if they used a SHA-1 root CA but with SHA-2 leaf, which is what I intend to do and which seems to be supported. I was then surprised to find the whole chain was SHA-1!  This is amplified by the Google blog talks about how the algorithm has been deprecated since 2011, and also other blogs posts by the team on how they notified all the CA's before in February. I would have expected Google itself to have completed the migration, given such language. Maybe it highlights the problem with the migration -  note that not all client software (for instance Google's own Android 2.3 from 2011) supports SHA-2 at all!"
crypto,2gr0rc,slyf,5,Thu Sep 18 12:35:24 2014 UTC,"Chromes decision will only cause issues for certs expiring after 2016 (and even then, more like 2017).  Theirs expires in 2014.  You are also mistaken, 2.3 supports SHA256, below that does not...and Android 2.2 only has a .7% android market share (If you ask google atleast).  Assuming you put yourself right up until the line, you can have a SHA-1 cert which expires in >2 more years and have minimal issues (Chrome considers after 2016 and sha-1 to be ""minor issues"", and 2017 to be the real issue).   Even if you do not want to have any issues at all with chrome, you could give yourself a cert today which expires in a full year and have no issues.

I also don't understand what you mean by ""you are also mistaken"" since nothing in your previous sentence contradicts any of what I wrote.  The point still stands, companies that bought SHA-1 certificates earlier this year (before this announcement) with duration past 2015 have to replace them at this unexpected time and on a short notice, to avoid warnings. I happen to work for such a company, and due to various reasons such certificate changes are not always easy.   The point is not whether or not google.com will show warnings in November! The point is that they really should have migrated themselves given all the pressure for all to do so (remember they said SHA-1 was deprecated in 2011).  As mentioned I went to their page to check if they had SHA-1 in the root and only SHA-2 further down. I had not expected to find SHA-1 all the way!"

crypto,2gr0rc,jrmxrf,3,Thu Sep 18 12:14:45 2014 UTC,"The risk of sha-1 is not really in its use, the risk is in issuance of new certificates.  When md5 was broken, someone showed that they could find two certificate keys that hashed to the same public key.  They then submitted a certificate signing request for one of them, which a CA of course signed as a server authentication cert.  They then used that signature for the other key as a subca, allowing them to then forge any certificates.  Its much easier to find two certs that collide than a collision with a given cert or fixed set of certs (see: Birthday Paradox)  So you see, the risk (still theoretical) is really of CAs issuing certificates signed with sha-1.  This is mitigated by CAs enforcing input validation on cert data to avoid collision engineering.  Google further controls this for their certs using pinning rules to specific CAs and enforcing pathlen.  Because google sites have pinning constraints (in chrome, opera and ff), they would be the hardest to forge through collisions, and doing so would be the most likely way to get caught.  So... while the industry needs to move to sha-2, Google using sha-1 right now is not a big security risk.  Where Google could lead is on passive client detection (see ssllabs sslhaf on github for example) to notify down level clients that they will lose access in the future."

crypto,2gnhel,tvtb,12,Wed Sep 17 11:55:01 2014 UTC,"Man, this is a confused question.  PBKDF2 provides a computationally expensive (how expensive is tuneable) way to turn an input into something looking random. And of varying that input->output mapping through the use of a salt.  PBKDF2 is useful for two main scenarios:   Password Storage by a system. Turning an input (most often a password) into a symmetric encryption key or other secret.   In both cases, the tuneable complexity is there to make brute force take longer and the salt is there to prevent pre-computing a short list (dictionary) of possible input offline and then quickly checking the output. The salt also ensures that multiple users using the same password will not have the same secret/encryption key unless they also have the same salt. The salt does not need to be secret but ideally, it is a number used once and if not random, then at least unpredictable.  In the case of systems storing their user's passwords, the system does not need to ever store the raw passwords since they can just pull up the salt from the DB, run the user supplied password and salt through PBKDF2 and then compare that with the stored PBKDF2 hash. If they match it's the right password. If the user database is compromised, an attacker basically has a much longer and more difficult job even breaking bad passwords. (There's more to it then that but this is the 30k feet view.)  In the case of password managers, the idea is to turn the master password into a encryption key and then use something like AES to encrypt the saved passwords. They might also separately derive things like an authentication key, public keys, whatever.  I hope this makes more sense."

A common technique is to use PBKDF2 to generate the AES password. So, user inputs their plaintext password, which is fed to PBKDF2 to generate a hash, which is used to encrypt/decrypt data using AES."

The problem is, apart from it being rather small, is that for example AES-128 needs a 128 bit key, exactly. So you need a reliable and reproducible way to map the any length text input into a 128 bit output value.   MD5 and SHA1 are two hashing functions. They both take some arbitary input and produces a 128 bit output. (Edit: SHA1 produces 160 bits) They will also produce the same output if given the same input, and the output is uniformly distributed in the ""keyspace"". Hey, that's some fancy features! We can use this to make the AES key! Then we can take any length password and use it for AES. Pretty damn handy.  The second problem then, is that your password is quite, quite small, and would take a computer milliseconds to get to when brute forcing. Part of this is because MD5 and SHA1 are pretty fast algorithms, which can be a good thing, but in this case is a really bad thing.   We don't care if it takes 0.0001 second or 1 second to open the password vault. It's something we rarely do, and doesn't affect us much. An attacker, however, will very much be affected by this, since he needs to do this millions of times to try and find the input that maps to the right key.  Well, there are some hashing functions that are slower than MD5 and SHA1, but what if you still prefer those two? Well, you could take the key generated from the password, and then hash it again for a new key, then hash it again, and again... Until it took a second for you to unlock the vault on your computer.

Finally, PBKDF2 uses a salt as well and this salt means that not only will it take a long time to try enough possible passwords to find your password but even if someone else has the same password as you, it will take just as long to find theirs since with a different salt, the output will be completely different."

An important consideration is that some factoring algorithms' complexity depends on the size of the number to be factored, while some depend on the size of the factor. So there's a trade-off, and the balance could change with any breakthroughs."
crypto,2gj7c0,TNorthover,12,Tue Sep 16 11:11:10 2014 UTC,"Suppose you have a 16 bit prime (p) and another 16 bit prime (q). Multiply them together you have part of your 32 bit rsa public key (n).  Suppose an attacker wants to crack your public key. The stupid brute force method is to factor n. Which is to try to divide n by every number from 2 to square root of (n), in this case every number less than 16 bits.  Now, suppose you have 3 numbers instead of 2. The new n = pqr where r is another 16 bit prime. Notice that cracking process still involves trying every prime smaller than 16 bits. As soon as you find a factor, you can factor the other two by dividing n by the first prime factor you found.  So adding more factors does not make the cracking process any harder. Instead, it just makes the public key longer."
crypto,2gj7c0,fishtastic,3,Tue Sep 16 06:25:04 2014 UTC,"So after you have found one of the factors you still need to find the other two which means that factoring for 3 primes is roughly twice as hard as 2 primes but this is not significant given the key expansion required.  With respect to it being easier for 3 primes, what is meant here is it is easier for the same length N. Since for 2 primes you need to check up to the square root of N, while with 3 primes you need only to check up to the cube root."
crypto,2gj7c0,danmartin656,11,Tue Sep 16 08:39:13 2014 UTC,"It is not twice as hard though.  If we use the algorithm described above, then as we find our first factor we do not need to start over. We now know that the remainder of the key divided by the now found smallest factor is not divisible by any number smaller than the smallest factor. Thus we can continue trial division from the current point instead of starting over.  So the number of trial divisions we need to do are actually only dependent of the second largest factor of the key as long as we know beforehand how many factors the key actually have.  The above is still true if we don't know the number of factors but the second largest factor is not small compared to the largest factor. If the second largest factor is less than the square root of the largest factor then we must continue up until the square root of the largest factor in order to see that the largest factor is prime.  So the number of primes do not actually matter. And if you are willing to use a key of length n, then it is best to choose two primes that are approximately sqr(n) in size."

However you are correct that trial division will take the same amount of time.  So for best security you want all of your primes to be approximately the same size. So for a key of size n, if you have k primes the you will find at a prime by only searching up to the kith root."

Thus we will find all other factors by searching up to sqrt(key) and as only on remains we know that to be the last factor.   In the two factor case one also does not want the primes two be too close since that opens up attacks from the identity (a² - b²) = (a+b)(a-b). I don't know how this translates to the k-factor case though.  I also have to confess not being an expert, and that our discussion only applies to the given algorithm. I don't know which of the more advanced algorithms easily translates from two-factor to k-factor factorization. Some of the assumptions of some of these algorithms might be broken by k-factor keys."
crypto,2gj7c0,Feydarkin,1 point,Tue Sep 16 11:50:41 2014 UTC,"You can't rely for security on someone using a bad factorisation method. For best security you want them to have no better option than brute force, and a high probability of having to search through a lot of candidates for factorisation. The more factors you add to your key, the smaller space of candidates they'll have to search.  For demonstration: For 3 factors, each of roughly similar size (this is to maximise the amount of candidates searched to find the first key!) the first one will be found after roughtly the cube root of the key length, leaving a compound number 2/3 of the digits long, searching through that you'll probably find the second number after the cube root of the key candidates. That gives you the factorisation after brute forcing 2 * cubert(keysize) candidates. The square root of the key size (AKA roughly how long it takes to search for 1 factor of a compound number) will be larger than twice it's cube root for any number large enough to be a conceivable key.  Of course you could make the first key small and the remaining keys huge, say 4 digits long. That space could be searched faster than you could blink, and has made your key 24 times weaker to brute force search, whereas extra digits on a key make it exponentially harder to search. It's most robust for the keyspace just use 2 big numbers.  This problem of needing so many digits to be robust against factorisation (and needing to use 2 big primes as factors) is part of why RSA keys are so huge compared with systems which aren't based on exponentiation/factorisation."

Multiprime RSA deployments use the same 1024- or 2048-bit modulus size that two-prime RSA does, but have more, smaller factors of N.  They don't keep the same factor size and scale to eg 1536 bits.  If there are two or three factors of about the same size, then the fastest publicly known attack is the General Number Field Sieve (GNFS).  The runtime of GNFS doesn't depend on how many factors there are or how big they are, just on the size of N.  So going from two to three isn't known to weaken RSA, but people don't do this because they are conservative.  If there are more factors of N, they will be smaller.  Past three or four factors, the Elliptic Curve Method (ECM) will become faster than GNFS, since ECM's runtime depends on the size of the smallest factor.  So past three or four factors with a fixed modulus size, you will lose security."

Some (elliptic-curve method is the best for difficult cases) depend on the size of the factors to be found, so resistance to them is ensured by having large factors. 2 factors provides the largest possible secret factors.  Others (general number field sieve) depend only on the number being factored.  They are fastest when the factors are particularly difficult, e.g.chosen to be particularly large, as in RSA.  You need your factors large enough that the former techniques aren't easier than the latter.  There have been significant advances in the NFS techniques since RSA was developed, so balancing the two can be done with less than half-sized factors.  But still, two factors is simplest and gives the greatest resistance to possible future advances in size-of-factor-dependent factoring algorithms, so people tend to stick with it.  The nice thing is that this only affects secret-key processing, so you can use more than two factors privately and nobody using your public key has to change their software to cope."
crypto,2gj7c0,cypherpunks,2,Tue Sep 16 20:30:28 2014 UTC,"To add to fishtastic's correct response, we can also see that brute-force search is actually sped up by adding more prime factors. For each additional prime factor chosen, the probability that brute force will find one of the factors, in a particular guess, increases. Think of the number line from 2 to N, where N is the largest prime we will use. Think of all the primes marked along that number line. If we used 50% of the primes between 2 to N to construct the public-key modulus then, on the first iteration, the brute force search would have 50% probability of finding one of the factors! While the probability of finding a new factor does decrease with each new factor that is found by the search, the brute-force search is still turning up information about the key. In other words, some number of bits of the key (I have no idea how to calculate this) are being discovered each time a new factor is found. The more factors, the higher the probability that they will be found by brute force and the faster that information about the key can be extracted by brute force. Using just 2 prime factors is the worst case from the point-of-view of brute force... it will require the most brute-force search for a given N to discover any bits of information about the key in the case of 2 factors."

Of course, this attack only works if the signatures are deterministic so they can be replicated by a third party.  Also, you wouldn't want to use ""one-time"" ring signatures for a conversation, or else every signature would contain a key image that reveals who the signer is.

OTR uses a combination of AES symmetric-key algorithm with 128 bits key length, the Diffie–Hellman key exchange with 1536 bits group size, and the SHA-1 hash function. In addition to authentication and encryption, OTR provides perfect forward secrecy and malleable encryption.  The primary motivation behind the protocol was providing deniability for the conversation participants while keeping conversations confidential, like a private conversation in real life, or off the record in journalism sourcing. This is in contrast with other cryptography tools that produce output which can be later used as a verifiable record of the communication event and the identities of the participants. In most cases, people using such cryptography software are not aware of this and might be better served by OTR tools instead. [citation needed] The initial introductory paper was named ""Off-the-Record Communication, or, Why Not To Use PGP"".   The OTR protocol was designed by cryptographers Ian Goldberg and Nikita Borisov. They provide a client library to facilitate support for instant messaging client developers who want to implement the protocol. A Pidgin and Kopete plugin exists that allows OTR to be used over any IM protocol supported by Pidgin or Kopete, offering an auto-detection feature that starts the OTR session with the buddies that have it enabled, without interfering with regular, unencrypted conversations.

It's a lot like secret sharing, where you have to XOR all the pieces to recover the original secret.  Using RSA because it makes a simpler example, you use the secret (decryption) key to generate a signature = Decrypt(hash), and anyone can use the public key to verify that hash = Encrypt(signature).  Basically, the hash is the ciphertext and the signature is the plaintext.  So what I do is generate a series of random plaintexts P2, P3, ... and, using public keys, corresponding ciphertexts C2, C3, etc.  Then I compute the required ciphertext C1 such that C1^C2^C3^... = hash.  Then, using my key, I compute P1 = Decrypt(C1).  The signature is the set of all plaintexts.  Anyone can convert them to ciphertexts with the public keys and verify the XOR.

I still think you may be right that non-one-time, non-deterministic ring sigs could be useful for a 2-way conversation.  The gem I wrote does indeed create deterministic signatures. It computes a seed, which is a hash of the private key and the message.

I haven't looked at your code to see the PRNG you use to generate all the different values.  It's important to get it right; the security proof requires completely uncorrelated random numbers, so you need to ensure that an attacker can't derive any one of the numbers from knowledge of all of the others.  That's not too difficult a thing to do, but it's not trivial, either.  What takes some thinking is whether you want to use an additional cryptographic primitive for it, or you can piggyback one of the existing ones."
crypto,2gi594,cypherpunks,1 point,Wed Sep 17 04:13:13 2014 UTC,"If you're interested in taking a peek at the code, I'd be delighted :) It's as straight-forward as I could make it: https://github.com/jamoes/ring_sig/blob/master/lib/ring_sig/private_key.rb#L76  That's the sign method, which initializes the seed. The q and w values are generated below on line 113.  The hasher.hash_string method is basically just a wrapper around whatever hash function the key was constructed with (typically Sha256). The hasher.hash_array method converts all the elements of the array into a canonical string form, concatenates them all together into a single string, and then hashes that string using the hash_string method. (You can also see the actual implementation of these methods in the Hasher class if you'd like).  So, the q and w values are generated by a secure hash function (the same hash function that generates the challenge elsewhere in the algorithm). When I implemented it this way, I didn't even think that I was deviating from the algorithm's specification - I just thought I was making a good design decision in the way I chose to derive the random numbers for q and w.  Addressing your other comment here:   The point is, the signature is not deniable.   One-time ring signatures aren't deniable anyway, because of the key image, so I don't think this is an issue.   Far better to avoid the need to evaluate the security of the weakened primitive entirely.   This is a really good point, and it has me thinking that maybe I should change the implementation. I could just have the sign method take in a third argument, which is a user-provided random number, and then hash that random number along with the message and the private key when generating the seed.  I'm leaning against doing this though, because based on the above analysis, it seems unnecessary. I'd rather not make the API and the signing algorithm any more complicated than it needs to be. I'd love to hear your thoughts though!"

Assuming the Hasher is instantiated with Sha256, then algorithm.digest(s) is computing the Sha256 hash of s.  s.unpack('H*').first.to_i(16) will convert a binary string (which is what the digest method returns) into an integer.  Assuming the Hasher is instantiated with Secp256k1, and Sha256, then the hash_string method will take a Sha256 hash of s, and test to ensure the output is less than the Secp256k1 group's order (which it almost always will be, since the order is only slightly less than 2256). If it happens to be greater than the group's order, then it will rehash the number until it finds a number less than the group's order. Finally, it will return the number.  EDIT: From looking over my code more closely because of this discussion, I realize now that there is a subtle bug in my implementation. The hash_string method should be returning a value between 0 and the group's prime (instead of between 0 and the group's order). Only the q and w values should be between 0 and the group's order. Most signatures based on Secp256k1 won't be any different, but it is still definitely a bug. I'll be releasing a new version shortly which fixes this.

A very important rule of crypto is to be very very careful weakening a security proof.  ""But that doesn't matter""is not obvious and requires extremely careful thought.  Far better to avoid the need to evaluate the security of the weakened primitive entirely."
crypto,2gi594,ganesha1024,9,Wed Sep 17 03:42:13 2014 UTC,There is also https://github.com/monero-project/urs although it's probably more useful for bitcoin type stuff. I'm interested in it's application in creating a pool of people who offer their bitcoin inputs and use ring signatures to mix the outputs making sure that everyone did say where they should go publicly but no one can tell who said it.  The other interesting application could be voting!! You can see everyone's vote but you can't tell who voted for who. Each voter can also verify and see that their vote is counted. If the signatures start getting too big you can divide the voting public into smaller sub-groups.
crypto,2gi594,dillpicklechips,2,Tue Sep 16 00:41:32 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the link! It looks like Unique Ring Signatures are very similar to One-time Ring Sigs that my gem and Monero implement. Do you know if they're implementing the exact same algorithm? If so, we should coordinate to make our signatures compatible with each other - there are a number of areas in the algorithm open to interpretation (such as how you concat an array, and how you hash and EC point).  I hadn't thought of the voting application, but that is a cool use-case! One caveat is that ring signatures grow linearly in size with the number of foreign keys used in the signature. If you're using a 256 bit curve, then each foreign key increases the signature size by 64 bytes. So, in a district with 10,000 voters, each voter's signature would be about 640 KB, and the set of all voters signatures would be 6.4 GB. This is feasible to manage, but if the district has 100k voters, each signature is 6.4 MB, and the set of all signatures is 6.4 TB - which I guess is still feasible I guess... It might be more feasible when Moore's law has kicked in a little more.  If you do plan on using ring signatures for a voting scheme, it probably makes since not to randomize the order of public keys (as my gem does). It would be better to just have all voters use a pre-determined ordering of foreign keys, which every voter uses. This would remove the need to transmit the ordering of public keys when verifying votes."

A hash is basically the result of a formula that produces a unique value for your data. To complete the signature you encrypt the hash with your private key. You send that encrypted hash as the signature.   On the other end, the recipient will decrypt the hash using your public key and see if the hash matches the message received. If one single letter is changed in the message the hash will no longer match and the signature will be invalid."
crypto,2gfoas,bbakks,2,Mon Sep 15 06:32:49 2014 UTC,"The signature is tied to the message text with a hash function like SHA-1 or SHA-256 (or for old ones, MD2 and MD5.)  With PGP the message is the text between the headers. Unless someone's found a weakness in the hash function (MD5 is known to be weak , SHA-1 is not looking good) then someone cannot transfer a specific signature to another message.  With MD5-based signature schemes it is possible to transfer signatures to some messages. This was demonstrated in 2009 when an SSL certificate was forged by getting a CA to sign a second certificate that had the same MD5 hash.  A big limitations of digital signatures is that they merely state that the signer was in possession of the private key and a hash of the message. Nothing more.  While with a strong hash function it's computationally impossible to substitute the message for another one that has the same hash, it doesn't mean that there cannot be attacks based on using the signature and its message for a use that wasn't intended.  For example when using digital signatures in authentication scheme like in SSL/TLS, it's common for the signer to include a nonce (number used once, ever) of their choosing in the message being signed to prevent re-use of the signature."

A few things stand out to me:   As our cryptanalysis will show, Vulcan is a catastrophically weak cipher, even when measured by 1970s standards. Vulcan would never have withstood public inspection and DVP would have been far less successful in the marketplace had its customers known how vulnerable this cipher actually was. We strongly suspect that many other proprietary ciphers are similarly weak and we warn against their use.  We emphasize that no special knowledge of cryptanalysis is necessary to break Vulcan; an undergraduate-level understanding of linear algebra is more than sufficient.  We believe that breaking a Vulcan-encrypted message would be a suitable homework assignment for students enrolled in an undergraduate cryptography course.   Our second question is why Vulcan is so weak. Admittedly, cryptography was much less well understood in the early 1970s than it is today; nonetheless, anyone with an undergraduate education in mathematics would have known at that time that Vulcan was seriously weak. It would not surprise us if this was deliberate.  Furthermore, even a simple nonlinear operation in the ciphertext mixing function would have eliminated the simple attack of linear algebra, but the designers chose not to do this either. We cannot offer a reasonable explanation why a simple nonlinearity was not included in order to strengthen Vulcan. Our suspicion is that Vulcan is deliberately weak, although we have no proof of this. Nonetheless, we prefer this explanation to the alternative possibility that the designers were simply incompetent.  No intelligence agency anywhere in the world would have had difficulty cracking Vulcan in the 1970s. Perhaps when NSA declassifies some of their signals intelligence operations of the 1970s — something not likely to occur for another 60 years — future cryptographers will have solid evidence of this claim.   and finally   We do not know why the myth still persists that reverse-engineering hardware is more difficult than reverse-engineering software.

In other words, ZRTP pretends that the encryption key setup is part of the voice data, so it will get routed along with all the normal voice data, without needing to interface with the SIP call setup/signaling layer.   However, ZRTP will not work with Asterisk, period. This is because Asterisk does not just route your calls. It sits in between you and the person you're talking to  eavesdrops on the call, records both sides, possibly adds audio or otherwise modifies the recording, then plays back its own version to the other party.   This man-in-the-middle munging of the media stream destroys the ZRTP data, so it'll never work.   Furthermore, it's worth noting that Asterisk's eavesdrop-on-and-falsify-the-voice-data behavior, while innocuous and expected if you want, e.g. an IVR phone menu system, is completely indistinguishable from an adversary's wiretapping you and injecting fake bits of conversations to confuse the other party to the call. In other words, Asterisk's behavior is exactly what ZRTP is designed to stop.   Now, it is possible to use ZRTP via an Asterisk plugin. However, you will not be the endpoint of the ZRTP call, the Asterisk server will be. Basically, you ask Asterisk to place a call for you, it calls the other guy, then the other guy and Asterisk set up a secure ZRTP link between them. You have to take it on faith that the conversation as relayed to your extension by Asterisk is unmodified and hasn't been recorded or snooped on by the Asterisk server.   You may want to look into proper SIP routers, and treat Asterisk merely as an extension in your system (e.g. dial 700 to access the interactive menu) rather than the main hub.

The intermediary server then decrypts that and takes the resulting message and sends it bit for bit on to the next recipients.

crypto,2g0kza,mitchellrj,1 point,Wed Sep 10 18:38:08 2014 UTC,"There are many variables here.   Do you have a bunch of people reading the same exact email account (like trashcanmail.com or the same user ID on a regular email system?).  If the account has a password, then it is a stupid idea because anybody can change the password and lock everyone out (I know from experience).  Use tashcanmail.com or similar if you feel compel to use a group email account (there are many similar services).  Are you attempting to conceal the social network, or do you not care if the NSA can identify the members of the group be review IP and network traffic records?  If you need to keep the group anonymous, try I2P to send messages or I2P-Bote mail if you want highly anonymous mail (or POND in TOR), but there is a learning curve, and I don't have the details.  If you want to use GPG/PGP... you can address multiple recipients in GnuPG (GPG).  The question now is: Is the sender(s) willing to encrypt the message addressed to each recipient's GPG ID?  if you use shell scripts/batch files, you can put all the IDS on the command line. You can also use the --hidden-recipient option on comand-line GPG to hide the recipient names for a tiny bit of extra privacy.  To avoid ex-members from reading the messages, you will need a rather sophisticated key structure.  Group member might not be willing or able to maintain the key structure, but here is a sketch:  Each member creates a GPG key pair that is valid forever.  Use fake names when creating the keys.  The long-term key is created with Option 4 for RSA ""Sign Only"".  Each member then creates a medium-range 'sign-only' key, and signs it with the long-term key.  The medium length key can be for 1 year or 5 years. The user then runs gpg --edit-key and specifies the key ID of the medium-range ID, and then uses 'addkey' to add three 'subkeys' to the medium-range key.  One subkey is for 'encrypt only,' one is for 'sign only,' and one is for 'auth' only (option 8--turn off encrypt and sign and activate auth).  The short-term key is set for some period of time, like one month.  The users uses gpg --sign-key along with the --default-key option to use the permanent key to sign the medium-term key (this also signs the subkeys).  Group members can 'trust' the long-term public key of people (run --sign-key on it) whom they trust, then as the short-term keys expire and new ones are issued, members can know to trust the new keys if the new short-term keys are signed by the long-term 'sign-only' keys that were previously trusted.  This is a lot to handle for a non-tech person.  If you are a fascist group leader, you would require each member to give you a revocation key that works for the permanent key and the medium-term key--that way you could distribute to the group and remove the member from the group."

Here are some ideas--you would have to judge how applicable they are to the real situations.  First some non-tech stuff:  1) Old-school: send an unsigned postcard to an address, and make copies for the board meeting.  Have a drop box where people can walk up and drop information (on paper or encrypted CD using the public key of one person who receives the messages).  2) If it is an actual board of a homeowner's association, company or other  organization, then they probably have a legal obligation to follow rules of order, and requests sent by the public to be considered by the board would go to the secretary who would add an entry to the agenda for consideration of the whole board--the board can not consider without a quorum (this is a topic to be reviewed by somebody who knows the rules of order that apply to the group, e.g. Robert's Rules of Order).  Tech consideration:  3) It would be a burden to require the sender to send a message to twelve recipients using public key encryption, so forget that idea.  It would be a burden to require senders to install a dark-net system if the real situation is anything vaguely similar to the homeowner's association example.  You will be limited to things that are super easy.  If it is an association that is not related to politics or crime, the other board members will think that you are insane.  4) Use an online web form -- people go to the web site and it is sent to your email address, you would have to see if it is anonymous from your end (or have one built that does not track IP): https://www.hushmail.com/services/forms/  5) For either legal reasons or practical reasons, the messages (from an online web form?) might go to one person (the secretary or chair) who forwards the message as need be:   a) the secretary puts the message as an agenda item if the rules permit an item to be presented anonymously or if the message had sender info that was confirmed.   b) the secretary receives all messages (or the chair receives all and forwards them to the secretary) and bundles them every week or month depending on how important it is--maybe copying the chair/leader on every msg.   c) the secretary might have the skills to send each bundle of messages using a script that uses public key encryption with multiple recipients.  6) If you are dealing with regular people in an apartment complex, they will probably ignore all the requests to use the secure web form and they will send regular email.  Once a message is sent via regular email, it is basically a waste of time to forward it using complicated encryption"

Using anything designed by the NSA gives them an insider advantage as the designers are in a unique position in that they know the ins and outs of the algorithm and likely publically unknown ways to exploit its weaknesses. As always give me a an algorithm from a trusted cryptographer any day over any algorithm designed by an adversary. I equate using NSA algorithms to using Chinese firewall/router hardware and hoping that your network is still secure from the Chinese government. From the SHA3 competition there were a bunch of new high quality algorithms from the cryptography community that are significantly better than these old NSA engineered ones. We should be using those and cryptographically combining one or two of them together to prevent future algorithmic breaks in one or the other.  I don't expect the IETF or whoever looks after TLS standardisation to actually care about real security from overreaching governments however. They've been infiltrated by the NSA for a long time. There was one incident a while ago where they tried to get one of the NSA members of the IETF group kicked out but that failed. He's still in there messing things up for everyone else.  TLS is basically controlled by a cartel of Certificate Authorities who have a vested interest in charging people a ton of money for what can only be described as a snake oil security system. You should rely on it for credit card transactions only and nothing else. At least then you have someone to sue if money gets stolen. If private communications gets decrypted then there's no recourse against anyone for that.  TLS is a monstrosity of bad design and insecure decisions. Please tell me why:   There are over 600 CAs in my web browser that I've never heard of but can sign any certificate, and the browser will implicitly trust a certificate signed by any of them even if the original site did not even do the certificate signing request with that company? This is a gaping backdoor for any intelligence agency if they have forced a CA in their country to give them a copy of their root certificate (a sure thing). The only signing algorithms are MD5 or NSA designed SHA1 and SHA2. Why not some unbroken hash algorithms from SHA3 competition? The only elliptic curve algorithms are not considered safe and are dodgy NIST curves. How about some safe curves from reputable authors? The only supposedly good cipher is AES, which has issues of its own. Why is there no decent backup ciphers like Salsa20 or Twofish, Threefish etc. It is very difficult to get a server config setup to do TLS correctly, mitigate all the recent attacks and stop protocol and cipher suite degrading. Why is it so complicated to configure properly? All the public key exchange algorithms are vulnerable to quantum computers. Time to get NTRU or similar backup ciphers going. I have to pay money for what should be an automated task to sign a simple certificate. Then when any non profit organisation e.g. CACert wants to provide free certificates for everyone they have to fork out $75,000 (and $10,000 per year after that) for some special security audit by a particular company so their signing certificate gets included in web browsers. Cartel indeed.   We should scrap TLS, fire everyone involved in this money making scam, develop a new, free, decentralised system without all the flaws and weak cryptography issues.

Paperkey makes it easier. It separates the private bits from the public, so you have much less to type, as well as adds line-by-line checksums so it's easier to find typos.  It's also best practice to generate (and again, print) revocation certificates for all your keys so you can revoke them if they're lost.

crypto,2fjkux,claytonkb,4,Fri Sep 5 14:11:21 2014 UTC,"WTH is up with this ""print out your private key"" crap?? Do not ever, under any circumstances, print out your damn private key. Even if someone is holding a gun to your head, be a man and take the bullet! Don't print it out!   But seriously, once a private key is printed out in the clear, you no longer have the ability to repudiate a future court order you may not want to comply with because it could turn up incriminating evidence... such as tax records, credit card and bank statements, etc. Even if you keep the printout in a safe, even if you have it in a safe deposit box... all the court has to do is issue a warrant, and the State gets what they want. There is nothing insecure or unreliable about digital storage. And the secret key must always be stored in encrypted form. Make multiple copies if you're worried about long-term degradation of the storage medium. A DVD will last decades if stored in a cool, dry place. And you could store a million copies of the private key on the DVD if you wanted, ensuring that at least one of them will be readable many decades into the future.  As for duplicate keys, this is not an issue as long as you have a single contact form where people can access your public key. If you receive an undecipherable message encrypted with an old public key, just auto-reply ""Please re-send your message with the key here http://whatever and update your keyring."" Public keys are cheap, requiring only a few seconds to generate, so you should not be squeamish about using gobs of them."
crypto,2fjkux,claytonkb,7,Fri Sep 5 19:04:21 2014 UTC,"It's fine to print out an encrypted secret key...   Note that paperkey does not change the security requirements of storing a secret key. In fact, paperkey doesn't do any crypto at all, but just saves and restores the original secret key, whether it is encryped or not. So, if your key has a passphrase on it (i.e. is encrypted), the paper copy is similarly encrypted. If your key has no passphrase, neither does the paper copy. Whatever the passphrase (or lack thereof) was on the original secret key will be the same on the reconstructed key. Also note that as with any backup or archiving system, it is prudent to verify you can restore the key from your paper copy before filing the paper away."

Whether a printed key is encrypted or not is mostly irrelevant because that only protects against thieves, and your physical protection should already be enough for that. Therefore the printed key should be unencrypted for the sake of reliability.

To accomplish this you could encrypt the private key, split it (not talking about a secret sharing thing here, just literally putting x bits in one pile, x in another, etc), and then put each ""pile"" in one or more separate areas. One example would be to put the key into an encrypted volume, split that volume using a file splitter, and then place each split into two places, one that is local to you and one on an online medium. For example, split 1 can go onto a DVD you keep at home and be backed up to Dropbox, while split 2 might go onto a USB drive that you keep in a bank security deposit box and also in your gmail, etc. You could even go a step further and make each split look like something else (e.g. stego, hidden volumes, etc.).  Note: I'd recommend encrypting each split every time you put it in a different location. In the example above, split 1 would be encrypted once for DVD and encrypted a different time for Dropbox. The reason for this is so an attacker can't tell that the encrypted contents on DVD are the same as the encrypted contents on Dropbox.

In this case the attacker only has to find one of the keys used, rather than all of them. If you have two copies encrypted with different keys then the amount of work the attacker needs to do is reduced to half. You are much safer by encrypting all copies in the exact same way.  If you want the data to look different (for the sake of obscurity, since your original encryption already provides enough security) then you should add a layer of encryption rather than replacing the original one.

What I tried to claim was if you have a physical model of the system, there are potentially (not guaranteed) inherit physical properties you can use as mathematical exploits.  If I were to implement a nuclear source as an RNG for example, I could use exponential decay as a starting basis to look for patterns in an RNG.  If it were a circuit, it would make sense to look at it from a quantum perspective to see if there are any pattern(s) of number selections which are influenced by the physical design of the circuit by looking at the electron from a quantum perspective traveling through long wells."

crypto,2f3x4f,cunttard,5,Sun Aug 31 22:02:27 2014 UTC,I've been told that authentication is uncommon in full disk encryption. I'm not exactly sure what it buys you since if an attacker can modify the sectors of a disk it probably has access to the drive in unencrypted form.
crypto,2f3x4f,Natanael_L,6,Sun Aug 31 23:23:12 2014 UTC,"True, but think of cloud storage synchronization. The provider can modify your disk image. A heavily monitoring provider may be able to determine where certain things on your disk were and then tamper with them without your knowledge.  Not really a major threat though (for the most part, equal to their ability to delete your disk image), but it could be worse in some, admittedly very specific scenarios, ie: if you were serving a folder from your encrypted image up on the web or similar, where a chosen ciphertext attack would be possible."
crypto,2f3x4f,cunttard,1 point,Sun Aug 31 23:56:02 2014 UTC,"Imagine an intercepted laptop which is checked for hardware bugs. You can tamper with their harddrive data, and with naive unauthenticated CBC mode you can even control the plaintext if you see willing to let one block get scrambled."
crypto,2f3x4f,Natanael_L,1 point,Mon Sep 1 13:09:45 2014 UTC,You may balk at this idea but you (the user that wants authentication) can use a filesystem which uses a strong checksum (i.e. cryptographic hash function). It is unsettling but it can do the job and doesn't require added complexity at the encryption layer.
crypto,2f3x4f,cunttard,1 point,Mon Sep 1 13:17:36 2014 UTC,"Depends on how the checksums are stored and handled. Some might actually be fully secure that way by accident, but chances are selective ciphertext reversal and similar attacks will be fully possible, as well as attacks against the checksum store."
crypto,2f3x4f,GahMatar,1 point,Mon Sep 1 18:58:14 2014 UTC,"Indeed; I was thinking ZFS which uses SHA256 for every block. If used in RAID >0 configuration and assuming only one drive was compromised, then self-healing/resilvering would take place.  I think only in the last decade we're finally seeing a surge in filesystems that use cryptographic checksums on data and I think this mostly solves the authentication problem for encrypted containers."
crypto,2f3x4f,cunttard,1 point,Tue Sep 2 02:19:47 2014 UTC,"Well, it's no panacea. If the block fits within the stripe size, you just fake the checksum too. That's what HMAC prevents through the use of a key. At a significant performance penalty."
crypto,2f3x4f,heliox,1 point,Wed Sep 3 16:10:43 2014 UTC,"Again when I say checksum, I mean a strong checksum (i.e. cryptographic hash).  If you can access the filesystem/container in unencrypted form changing block of data & checksum is easily possible.  If you intercept the system temporarily (as in Natanel_L scenario) where you're able to twiddle with a block, you will also need to twiddle with the  encrypted checksum. I posit this is as hard as forging a MAC."

crypto,2f3x4f,heliox,3,Mon Sep 1 00:25:59 2014 UTC,"IIRC, there are a lot of issues with GBDE that are fixed in GELI. IIRC, GBDE is largely unmaintained because it has too many issues. Just looking at the GBDE man page DESCRIPTION is enough to make me run GELI instead. I think it's in the documentation because it was first.  Arguing that it's flawed because it doensn't do authentication is a loser. You might as well argue that a honda civic is flawed because it doesn't support 20"" wheels natively. Authentication wasn't a design requirement. GBDE and GELI are designed as block storage providers to GEOM managed by root. If Mallory has hardware access, you've generally already lost.

Our design philosophy was to create an encrypted message service without a Single Point of Failure that could compete in speed with standard email.  For those more concerned about anonymity, we are currently throwing around the idea of an optional Tor-like system (would it be called TOE? The Onion EMP?) Where encrypted messages are themselves encrypted with another address and sort of hops from address to address.  Obviously that is slower, but it would significantly reduce the likelihood of traffic analysis.  I've seen your comments all the way down the page. Thank you very much for your feedback!"

So I have a couple more questions, if you don't mind:  While I understand the desire to do it within your own network, is there an advantage that EMP+Onion routing would have over bitmessage?  Have the devs read the defcon talk, ""De-Anonymizing Alt.Anonymous.Messages"" by Tom Ritter and Zax?  Have you applied any lessons from this kind of analysis to EMP?  While some issues are specific to the PGP+Usenet medium, others are broadly applicable to anonymous messages (client fingerprinting, etc.)."

crypto,2f1hu5,stouset,2,Sun Aug 31 03:43:43 2014 UTC,"I have a couple of questions.  How does this differ from other encrypted messaging solutions e.g. I2P-Bote, Retroshare?  What was the reason for the successive license changes (ARR, GPLv3, MIT)?  Will any of your changes be pushed back upstream into Bitmessage?"
crypto,2f1hu5,stouset,1 point,Mon Sep 1 03:10:08 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the questions!   To be honest I have not used those services yet, so I can't give a complete answer. I think that Retroshare uses GPG, so their authentication is based on a web of trust while EMP tries to be trustless. There are also encryption differences (ECIES vs. SSL). I'm also not sure how their caching works or even if data can be sent while one party is offline.   Really, I think that competition in this space in general is a good way to make sure there are enough solutions so consumers can find the best one for their application.   We were definitely waffling around on our licensing decisions since we originally were unsure of the direction we wanted to go, and I guess it was a mistake to keep them all in the git history. However, we are all committed to BSD now, and no versions past 0.1.4 will be different. I don't think that is possible. As of right now, besides our encryption scheme, I think that our protocol is incompatible with BitMessage. Also, our design philosophy is different. BitMessage puts more value on anonymity, while we place a higher value on performance.   That said, we pulled a lot from BitMessage, so if anything in EMP is something that BitMessage could use, they can certainly pull from us as well.  I'm sorry if these answers are unsatisfactory, we are still quite new to the space."
crypto,2f1hu5,stouset,1 point,Mon Sep 1 16:46:02 2014 UTC,Thanks for the detailed reply. It would be good to see how this compares to the DHT based I2P Bote of you ever get the chance to try it out.  One thing that I'm curious about is how messages are propagated through the network if a user is offline. bitmessage had an inefficient way of doing this by staggering the times of messages being resent. How does EMP address this?
crypto,2f1hu5,stouset,2,Mon Sep 1 20:32:21 2014 UTC,"I'm very grateful that it keeps messages available for at least one month. BitMessage's 2-day taper for message availability is really a major problem in my eyes for that system. It would probably be good to do some similar tapered re-broadcasting with EMP, as well, though."
crypto,2f1hu5,DemosthenesLocke2012,1 point,Mon Sep 1 05:52:36 2014 UTC,We're always looking at this and trying to balance the pros and cons.  In all likelihood this will become a node-configurable option.
