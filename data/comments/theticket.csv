theticket,3dfj90,bkharmony,7,Wed Jul 15 22:16:14 2015 UTC,You didn't enjoy hearing about Joe Cocker's drug use and depression 40 years ago?
theticket,3dfj90,willy2cool,4,Wed Jul 15 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"The Hardline and The Musers have really been driving me crazy with their music talk lately. Outside of Biggest Show Coming to Town, if they talk music, it's an immediate punch out for me.  It's almost guaranteed to be about U2, the Foo Fighters, Neil Young, the Rolling Stones, or some other nostalgia dad rock act. These bands are all fine, but they talk about them CONSTANTLY, like they're the only bands in the world that are doing anything worth mentioning.  I give props to Gordon and BaD Radio because they have musical tastes that are a little broader.  In particular, the bumper music that BaD plays constantly surprises me with how good and modern the stuff they're playing is. I'm guessing this is partly due to the fact that BaD surrounds themselves with younger people who are a little more plugged in to the modern music scene.  I would absolutely love hearing Rhyner review music from newer acts. Like, what would he have to say about Death Grips?"
theticket,3dfj90,bkharmony,4,Thu Jul 16 15:12:30 2015 UTC,"Dude. Bruh. I'm a music guy much more than a sports guy. I like music talk. But what THL and Musers consider music talk is awful. It would be like if I hosted a music show and decided to lean heavily on generic, blasé sports opinions.  I've defended The Hardline's music talk in the past, based on the fact that Mike and Danny are good musicians in their own right with a solid grasp of music history. But it's gotten to be too much, and it's gone too Corby. Corby is a music moron. I swear I'm going to drive off the High Five next time I hear the word ""widespread"" come out of his stupid mouth. We effing get it! You like shitty music and you want all of DFW to know about it!  I can't believe it, but I actually switched to Ben & Skin the other day rather than listen to another Corby music segment. I hate Ben & Skin. And yes, I hated myself for doing it. Dammit Corby, stop making my hate myself!"
theticket,3dfj90,Igotolake,3,Thu Jul 16 15:31:05 2015 UTC,"+1  Especially because at that time there was stuff going on. All star game, big stars deal, dez deal, deal around nfl, j speith trying to go bagger vance.  Yet, someone decided to have a long segment about an old musician. At least it got interrupted to get things back to relevancy.   +1 re BaD with the music and youngsters. More and more the age is showing in nonafternoon. Maybe just by itself a segment about red rocks would be cool, but with all of it gets a meh."
theticket,3dfj90,Raider_Power,2,Thu Jul 16 18:50:07 2015 UTC,"Same here I can't stand Ben and Skin or the guys on ESPN, but I'd rather drive in silence than listen to another old rock segment.   I'm definitely on the young end of the demographic for the station so I know there are P1's who have listened to these bands for a long time and probably do care to hear some of the segments. It's just too much and they aren't that interesting.   Hardly any of my friends listen to the ticket because of things like this and that is the future of their listeners...The musers seem to have an exclusive contract with U2 and Corby with the foo fighters."
