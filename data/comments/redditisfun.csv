redditisfun,3e37up,IAmTheOnlyNobby,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:41 2015 UTC,Just got this phone yesterday and I noticed that when running RIF on it names and times do not appear when browsing topic lists... Is this a known issue or should I reinstall?   Edit: came from using RIF on an LG G Flex and had no issues  Edit2: so after some more tinkering I've found out that clicking once on a topic will display the hidden info. This differs from my previous version on the Flex where the info was displayed by default... Now to figure out how to unhide it
redditisfun,3e37up,talklittle,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:59 2015 UTC,"There is a custom downloadable theme under Menu -> Theme, called ""reddit is fun 3.0"", which displays the info by default.  However note that some of the theme icons and stuff are a bit outdated right now, and that theme is Beta quality with some bugs."
redditisfun,3e37up,StrobingFlare,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"Cool cool cool, thanks :)"
redditisfun,3e37up,anon99161,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:14 2015 UTC,Odd. I've never seen names on posts in RiF until I tap as you describe; on phone or tablet.
redditisfun,3e37up,StrobingFlare,0,Wed Jul 22 02:01:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm, it looks like you enabled ""ninja mode"". If you go under settings, and click on ""name settings"", you will see it there and disable it."
redditisfun,3e4typ,Hazasoul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:33:57 2015 UTC,"The only option at the moment is to click-hold-slide from the left to bring up the subreddit list and then select All, which will show you ALL subs. Or select Reddit front page, which will show you all your subscribed dubs."
redditisfun,3e4typ,ReyEra,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:08:11 2015 UTC,"I would actually hate this. The exit warning is what protects me from accidentally leaving the current page I am browsing. Plus, if you have clicked through a bunch of Reddit links, pressing it repeatedly will quickly get you back to your current page without closing it."
redditisfun,3e0sln,MrSnugglebuns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:05:35 2015 UTC,You can share a link to comments and from there they can easily go to the subreddit that the post is in.
redditisfun,3e0sln,setthehook,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:18:17 2015 UTC,"You can go to the app settings and delete the default open settings either for the browser or RIF (I can't remember which one,  most likely only the browser). This wont open rif when you go to the sub, but you'll have to set up the browser to open the apps you want again."
redditisfun,3dzeix,1chriis1,24,Mon Jul 20 19:44:03 2015 UTC,Completely black theme. So I can use the app at night without hurting my eyes.
redditisfun,3dzeix,k0mbine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:38 2015 UTC,Always looks weird when people show a screenshot of regular reddit tho since I'm so used to the full black
redditisfun,3dzeix,MrAppleSpiceMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:26 2015 UTC,Should be the default imo
redditisfun,3dzeix,silphider,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:35 2015 UTC,"Also, uses less battery."
redditisfun,3dzeix,JBuk399,6,Tue Jul 21 02:16:13 2015 UTC,Only on AMOLED screens.
redditisfun,3dzeix,TunaLobster,2,Tue Jul 21 03:11:39 2015 UTC,Precisely.
redditisfun,3dzeix,k0mbine,3,Tue Jul 21 02:55:48 2015 UTC,Usually I'm with the completely black theme. The white one looks the best but the black one saves sooo much battery for me because I have a galaxy s6 with an amoled display and therefore black pixels aren't used.  I use this app all day and barely lose any battery.  It's awesome.
redditisfun,3dy047,______ayy_lmao______,2,Mon Jul 20 13:36:45 2015 UTC,I dicked around enough to discover what the next and previous buttons do. That'll do for now

redditisfun,3dosny,olligobber,2,Sat Jul 18 00:50:29 2015 UTC,Have you checked reddit in a browser to see if it stuck?
redditisfun,3dosny,astoughastoph,2,Sat Jul 18 01:28:00 2015 UTC,The setting did not change in the browser. After changing it in the browser the posts disappeared in both the browser and the app.
redditisfun,3dosny,OfficerMurphy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:31:22 2015 UTC,It doesn't do it immediately. You have to refresh it after liking or disliking links.
redditisfun,3dldej,squad_steel,37,Fri Jul 17 05:17:58 2015 UTC,"To my understanding, it is a reddit feature that hides the score so that users cannot manipulate the actual score for a period of time. If it were not hidden and they saw that it had a few negative/positive points, users would more than likely choose to go with that one side. Mostly to control the trolls."
redditisfun,3dldej,screamingexile,15,Fri Jul 17 06:05:24 2015 UTC,Yep. It's a per-subreddit option. Individual subreddit mods can choose to hide scores for anything between 0-1440 minutes.
redditisfun,3dldej,Doctor_McKay,9,Fri Jul 17 14:07:58 2015 UTC,"I think that votes are hidden for a while, in some attempt to avoid rigging by bots.   Someone else will be able to answer far better than I."

redditisfun,3dg5pt,keenanpepper,16,Thu Jul 16 04:20:12 2015 UTC,"It's easy, but it takes more time to delete the text than to just cancel the reply and open it up again after maybe saving a draft if you were in the middle of one.

redditisfun,3dg5pt,armyrope115,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:22:30 2015 UTC,Yup. These are both ideal solutions imo
redditisfun,3dg5pt,StrobingFlare,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:38:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with OP.   Sometimes you want to do more than just quote a single reply, so ""quote parent"" is not enough. You may want to mention things said in several posts, or just need to check a fact from an earlier reply.   So I'd like to see the reply box appearing in-line, just below the post you are replying to, rather than as a pop-up box. That way you could scroll up and down through the rest of the whole topic while composing your reply."
redditisfun,3db54z,Jthumm,2,Tue Jul 14 22:21:24 2015 UTC,This happens to me from time to time. I assumed it was some sort of api limit reached by the app.

redditisfun,3c90ly,IveDoneItAtLast,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:23:10 2015 UTC,"So basically the Dev just needs to add a confirmation dialog upon pressing ""Cancel"", kinda like ""Are you sure you want to delete this message?"" ""Yes, No or Save as draft""  It wouldn't call it a bug though, i believe the app was written to function the way it currently does.  I do agree a confirmation dialog would be useful here and maybe an option in settings to remove the confirmation, kinda like we currently have ""Are you sure you want to quit?""  As for other users asking about the ""Are you sure you want to quit"". Yes i get this option so if you're already set to receive that in settings and you dont, thats a bug."

It allows you to stay within the app instead of opening up a different app.  If you want the functionality that you're looking for, /u/talklittle would either have to default to always open in the browser as opposed to the Web View or you'd have to click the ""Open link/comments in browser"" button inside the app."

redditisfun,3bzrxs,fallbeyond,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:14:01 2015 UTC,It'll be different. People will just participate less.  Like I find myself doing.  We left digg because they destroyed the community. We will leave reddit if they commercialise the community. We haven't gotten to digg levels yet.

redditisfun,3br8qr,Flameknight,2,Wed Jul 1 14:35:35 2015 UTC,"As you've probably found, just visiting a multireddit adds it to the list in your sidebar.  The only way to remove ones you don't want is as follows...   For multireddits created by OTHER PEOPLE,  first ""Star"" any multis that you DO want to keep (by tapping the hollow star icon beside their name and turning it solid). Next, go to Settings / History and select  ""Reset multireddits"". As the notes in the pop-up box say, that should remove all non-starred Reddit curated by other people.  Any you have created yourself (or made a copy of)  should be unaffected.  For YOUR OWN multis.... In RiF, you can delete any multi you have created yourself by first viewing the sub-Reddit list for a multi (by tapping the ""three lines"" icon beside the name.  That should produce a pop-up box where you can see the subreddits included in that multi, and theres also a ""bin"" icon top right to delete the whole multi.  Other general editing / merging etc of your own multireddits is best done in Reddit itself on a browser."

Next time you open a link you'll get the choose default option and you'll have to always click the 'just once' option but this way you can select the download manger for gifs and a browser for everything else. I actually prefer this so I can open certain things in an ad blocking browser as well. But then opening it in adm will give you the feature you're looking for.

When i first opened the new gold plat app, i had to click sign in (top right menu) then it offered either my current account or create a new one.

redditisfun,3a57b7,IveDoneItAtLast,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:01:54 2015 UTC,"I pulled out a third device, just to see if I was doing it wrong or something. Samsung Captivate Glide running some build or other of PAC, it's labeled as 4.4.4-RC2. Same thing, free app still has all of my info and works normally. Paid opens as a completely clean install. Clicking login just brings up the standard login page, which I'm avoiding since I don't really remember throwaway passwords. I haven't tried logging in with, say, this account, but that shouldn't salvage my other accounts and their history.  This device is a bit more customized. It's running xposed with a handful of mods, including full sd card access, xprivacy, minminguard, lucky patcher, and a modded play store. Don't judge, it's a tertiary device that has no service and frequently no wifi - it's frustrating to have legit purchases fail drm because I have no internet. The first two devices have service and obviously don't run this kind of setup.  I've probably got some unrooted device laying around that I can test that too, assuming I'm not just missing something obvious. For that matter, I can throw a stock 4.0.4 on this, or a jellybean rom, if it matters.  On another annoyance, my other two devices play .gifv fine, this one gets stuck with the black screen. I assumed it's because this is an older device that supports arm7 but lacks neon - a peculiarly that's caused problems in official Google apps more than once."
redditisfun,3a57b7,IveDoneItAtLast,0,Wed Jun 17 21:46:03 2015 UTC,"Just an idea but have you by any chance moved either the free or paid app to sd card? Im wondering if its having trouble seeing it if thats the case.  When i switched to the gold plat app, i just tapped my user name from a list of 2 options which was either u/Ivedoneitatlast or Create new account. I didnt need to enter my password. Only other difference i can see is that i only have one reddit account, maybe theres an account import bug if you have several accounts? But saying that, i know throwaways are pretty popular on here so surely someone else would have hit that bug by now? I do agree that logging in with one account shouldnt bring your others up because they arent really connected and like i said, i didnt need to enter the information, the gold plat app appeared to import it from the free app.  Im running lollipop on this device but i know kitkat is currently far more popular so i cant see it being an OS version problem.   As for your .gifv problem maybe it is that neon thing? We had major issues opening gifs on lollipop but it turned out to be a problem with Android System Webview which can be updated through playstore since lollipop was released (we downgraded to factory version to solve issues). You're on kitkat so you dont have that option.  Im out of ideas now so maybe someone else has some suggestions?   I hope you get things fixed"

And if you go to the multi sidebar in RiF and type in a known multi name, it only looks for ones created by yourself, so doesn't find existing ones curated by others.  So how do I even go to one?

So have you tried downgrading Android System Webview yet? Its a well known issue that seems to be persistent even after google have updated it a few times  I also notice you're on the paid for RIF and i have recently seen quite a few complaints about it glitching and having issues. I know its good to support devs and i looked in the playstore yesterday to see what benefits paid had over free. There are no benefits listed and if im honest, posts like yours put me off purchasing. My RIF works so why would i pay to break it?"

redditisfun,39rrw2,IveDoneItAtLast,0,Sun Jun 14 14:23:49 2015 UTC,"Yea good point, im gonna go pay for it because even if it is an issue with the paid version, i can just uninstall and continue with the free version. I'll also be able to confirm if it is indeed issues with the paid version. Plus ive been using RIF for around a year now so the dev definitely has earned it.  As for your battery life, ive seen people say my z3 is worse on lollipop but during the 2 or 3 months ive had it now, ive been totally happy with battery life. I would have just downgraded back to kitkat if it had been that bad. Maybe you should look into your options of downgrading back to kitkat. Maybe lollipop will solve your issues? Id suggest having a look on XDA developers, search your device and see what your options are.  Hope you get your problem fixed soon"

Since so much of what makes Android work relies so heavily on having timely updates to the OS and core components, any other device fails the basic functionality test, as nice as they may be.  As much as I generally dislike Apple products, the iPhone is not a fractured product, even over hardware and OS generations. They nearly always work like you expect them to. Google needs to work on that."
redditisfun,39oyg3,wewd,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:09:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its a combination of this and complete unwillingness to admit when a bug is released to the OEMs. I've spent 3 weeks trying to help identify the issue with IPV6 DNS routing to Lorenzo (Google Dev) and still Lorenzo tries to place the blame everywhere else but on their code. I'm running a build based on the google play edition of my device and still experience this issue, but no apparently its Sprint and HTC causing the issue still even though they've had zero influence on the build I'm running. Because of this my company has forced me onto an iphone which doesn't experience the DNS issue with IPV6."

There are plenty of other actual bugs that may need priority, that may be unknown to the user.     But if you already have friends added from the browser, you can go to /r/friends on any mobil app."

For example, Reddit Pics (a gallery-type viewer for Reddit) attempts to open m.reddit.com links when you tell it to show you the comments. This ends up opening a browser instead of Reddit is Fun.

I know in the past when ive left it on New, thats the first thing i see when i fire RIF back up.   If you've tried that, maybe try one more time with the above method.

redditisfun,383i3w,finkton,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:18:39 2015 UTC,This is probably an issue of the app only registering an intent for urls of www.reddit.com and reddit.com instead of *.reddit.com  This issue happened before when you would click an np.reddit.com link from a sub like /r/bestof within the app where it would open a webview for the thread instead of opening it up normally.  It's extremely obnoxious since I use google instead of reddit search often to find old stuff.

redditisfun,37neac,TotallyNotObsi,3,Fri May 29 02:26:44 2015 UTC,The app already is Material Design
redditisfun,37neac,njdevilsfan24,3,Fri May 29 03:05:52 2015 UTC,I personally don't like the washed out colour scheme. Colourful apps are very enjoyable to use. RIF has the best features and user interface but the colour scheme is a bit too boring.
redditisfun,37neac,ThePurpleK,3,Fri May 29 10:52:50 2015 UTC,"That is true, I use the black scheme so I am not one to say"
redditisfun,37neac,njdevilsfan24,0,Fri May 29 11:36:27 2015 UTC,"Technically, it is, but that would mean every app on Google Play is. It is commonly defined as having a floating menu button (bottom right corner) and a different way to navigate the app entirely. There is absolutely no problem with how the app is set up, as I can navigate well, but a material design would make this app look cleaner and navigate slightly better, all while running faster!"
redditisfun,37neac,JustAThrowaway4563,7,Fri May 29 03:49:15 2015 UTC,"Material Design is a set of guidelines, not rules. Google encourages developer discretion when implementing Material. RiF has the bar at the top, it has drop shadows, it has a hamburger menu. Not every app needs a FAB. Adding a FAB because Material calls for it, will only lead to cluttered apps in the market place. YouTube doesn't have a FAB, despite the ability to upload videos."
redditisfun,37neac,nacholicious,3,Fri May 29 09:38:35 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, the reddit use case is very much too complex for what the guidelines call for when there's only one or two actions per view.

This is in the browser though and I have to go back 3 times to get to where I started. Clearly something is adding that .jpg on the end when it's not supposed to.

I also can't access any of the other stuff up top, I can't even remember what else was up there but I can't access any options either. I think there's also a couple other things I'm missing but I can't remember exact what is missing.  Anyone else having similar problems?  My loading bar also started doing this (loading in the middle of the image or page loaded) it doesn't really bother me but I thought it might be related. Sorry if it's not really clear in that screen shot but that'll at least give y'all an idea of what's going on.  Edit: grammar and such  UPDATE: Updating System WebView fixed the problem!

redditisfun,352wla,SpiralCutLamb,1 point,Sun May 10 22:12:09 2015 UTC,If you have Xposed you can stop it using App ops. From within App ops select Reddit is Fun and disable audio focus. Unless you are using the external browser work around to fix the crashing gifs. Then you would have to disable audio for your external browser.

redditisfun,34vz5l,bobbysq,3,Tue May 5 14:58:29 2015 UTC,This might be due to a mess up on a mod's end if they didn't clear out the spam filter for a while.

redditisfun,34v20f,rsl12,7,Mon May 4 20:17:28 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you. The extra click doesn't bother me nearly as much as wasting all that extra screen space on a bunch of posts who's comments I don't want to read would. To borrow from your analogy, adding the line of wasted text for each post would in fact be the chair in the middle of the intersection."
redditisfun,34v20f,OfficerMurphy,2,Mon May 4 22:58:09 2015 UTC,I agree with you. I wouldn't want to accidentally go to a posts comments when I just wanted to scroll the page.
redditisfun,34v20f,paskaak,-1,Tue May 5 13:09:18 2015 UTC,"What extra space are we talking about?   All other mobile reddit apps  (that I'm aware of) accomplish this by having the menu linked to a slide of the finger or a long press, freeing up the single click for navigation to comments.   RiF is the only app (that I'm aware of) that doesn't let you get to comments directly."
redditisfun,34v20f,the_native,5,Mon May 4 23:34:48 2015 UTC,So a long press/slide of the finger is better than just a single press? It barely takes a second to get to the comments with the single press.
redditisfun,34v20f,the_native,0,Mon May 4 23:46:03 2015 UTC,"share    save  hide  show poster's profile  open in browser  report post     How often do average users use any of these functions, compared to the frequency they want to see the comments?  Alien blue,  Relay,  Sync,  Bacon all give easy access to comments.  RiF, though it does many things better than the other apps, goes against the grain on this issue."
redditisfun,34v20f,the_native,2,Tue May 5 03:48:21 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on anything about the other apps since I've never bothered to use any of them.. But its literally a double tap to open the comments, before that there is no clutter. You tap to open all those other options along with the option to open the comments. A long swipe/hard tap seems like it would only add more time to opening the comments..(even then it would only be like a whole nother second..)"
redditisfun,34v20f,i-R_B0N3S,0,Tue May 5 04:05:14 2015 UTC,"It's not a simple double tap.   A double tap would be preferable to tapping, looking for the ""comment"" button to appear, moving your finger over it,  and then tapping again."
redditisfun,34v20f,a5myth,2,Tue May 5 04:11:19 2015 UTC,And turning that motion into a slide across the screen fixes this issue for you?
redditisfun,34v20f,napstrix,1 point,Tue May 5 05:40:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, a slide to get comments would be an improvement for sure."

Google split it out in lollypop so they could update it through the market, kinda like they've done with keyboard and now messages. Are you running a custom rom? Maybe your version came with a bad Webview version? Or is it just lately its started acting up? If you're running stock android (below lollypop), check see if you're manufacturer has released any updates. Another idea is to test a different reddit client, see if you still have problems."

There's nothing that can be fixed in RIF short of using something other than WebView, which basically means writing a whole web browser from scratch.

Curiously, when I click it from my apps list, the only thing I can do is hit ""Force Stop."" The other buttons--turn off, clear cache, move to sd card, clear data--are grayed out and not clickable. Thus, I can't clear the cache, though again, it says it's 0.00B. Maybe I need to reinstall this? Can I even download this off the app store, or is this some kind of internal processing application?

The thing about simply uninstalling it from the app store is after sometime Google reinstalls it. Disabling it seems to work in my case."

This issue predates the Android Webview update. I've been having lockups and full phone crashes for almost two weeks. I've cleared my phones cache and reset to factory settings. Neither have fixed the issue.   I'm not sure this is actually a webview issue.

Edit: I can use my keyboard outside of the apps that were crashing. Force close them and it restores the keyboard issue for me.  Uninstall ""Android System WebView"" and it should solve your problem"

There is nothing I can do except wait for Google to release another update fixing their bug.  You can also uninstall the Android System WebView update via the Play Store.

To prevent accounts from being deleted, the workaround is to install the lite version alongside the pro version. You don't have to use the lite version, just keep it installed.  It is an Android bug affecting paid apps of many developers: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=34880  It is up to the phone manufacturer to release a proper fix.

The gifvs DO play in my browser (I usually use Dolphin)  Well, I'm sorry to say that for me its far, far worse, but not in a way you'd be expecting. (EDIT - I seem to have the same problem as /u/perpetual_beta is having in his post).   I have always found it impossible to view any gifv that's larger than about 2MB on this phone (Sony Xperia Tipo running ICS).  I am assuming it is something to do with lack if memory, but I held out a vague hope that it might be solved by these tweaks in RiF.  As i feared, theres no change, gifvs will still not load and play, but why am I saying it is actually  much worse for me?  With the new version of RiF, Gifycat gifvs are no different, the first thing I see is a pair of stripes allowing me to select between gifv or old-style gif. If I select gif, it will usually play (slow or jerky, but I can get something).  Imgur also allowed me to select a standard gif version... the gifv would try to load (and fail) but at the bottom were two tapable links - ""Download"" on the right and a green dot and the word ""Imgur"" on the left. By tapping that left-hand link I could get Imgur to reload the normal gif.  Unfortunatly, in the new RiF app, those links have vanished.  Every gifv loads as a still image only and there's NOTHING I can find to prompt the plain gif to load instead. This is a disaster for me, I'm afraid,  Is there any way to either get those Imgur options back, or can I get the old version of RiF back on my phone, please?  (To all who say ""get a new phone"", I'd love to... but I'm only a year into a two year contract)."
