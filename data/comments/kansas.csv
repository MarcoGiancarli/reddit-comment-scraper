I understand people saying that it will be beneficial to have experts in their fields teaching classes. I'm a musician and one of the wonderful things about being a fine arts teacher is that our students can see us applying what we teach. My students can watch me perform and I am an active working musician. That's amazing.  However, I know a lot of professional musicians and even very gifted amateur musicians who are lousy teachers. There's a reason that teachers have specialized training, and there's a reason for the incredibly bleak statistics regarding how many teachers quit within the first five years. It's not an easy job and it does require a specific set of skills that may or may not be related to the content.  So, yes, having an engineer teach engineering might be wonderful. Or, it might result in lawsuits or even worse harm the students because the engineer didn't know how to manage a class full of high school students."

kansas,3dazwx,sunflowerfly,6,Tue Jul 14 22:26:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, but ""poverty"" not compared to those living without food or shelter, but to other jobs that require similar education. Most jobs require a minimum of a bachelor, and many a masters degree. 40k-45k a year is hardly wealthy.   Edit: keep in mind that the average for people with only a high school level educational attainment was $38k, although sadly this has slipped to about $35k, bachelor level education attainment $57,250, and masters level $69k. Most teaching jobs require at least a bachelor, and many a masters.   This means when buying a house, a car, or taking vacations, their ability to pay is not far above those that choose to forgo college, as opposed to choosing a different degree to complete. This difference accumulates annually.   Edit 2: personal anecdote. My wife has a masters in nursing education, but we cannot afford the 10k-20k pay cut for her to go from working as a nurse, a job that requires a 2 year degree, to teaching nursing at the collegiate level. She does adjunct occasionally."

If you decide to pull in?  Did you even read the article?  There isn't a roadblock or a special lane for the drug check.  They'd have to pull you over.  In order to pull you over, they'd (legally) have to have traffic on you (a valid offense, a reason for the stop).  Also, the article states that a drug dog is in use.  That means that the dog will be there either with the cop that pulls you over, or immediately thereafter.  So, you won't be getting ""paid"" because the stop won't  (read: shouldn't) be extended at all.    Some solid advice is to:  1) Be kind throughout the encounter if you do get pulled over.  2) Ask why they pulled you over, then ask if you're free to leave or if you're being detained. 3) If asked, do not give permission to search your car."

Funny how Republicans are ostensibly against the expansion of government until they get an opportunity to pass a completely unnecessary law just for propaganda purposes. There's no doubt in my mind that that's what this is about. Brownback made an strawman issue by saying marriage equality will entail forcing churches to perform gay marriages, and then ""defeated"" it so now his religious base who don't know any better will cheer him on.  More of the same old tactic of using issues like gay marriage as a distraction from how bad their policies are fucking shit up."

For the 1% are the activists for whom now that the culture war is won, it is time to go house to house shooting the survivors. It is only a matter of time before the force of the state is brought against a religious institution that declines to perform the civil portion of a marriage ceremony for a same-sex couple or even if religious institutions decline to no longer perform the civil portion and only the religious portion they will be brought to heel. It would be wonderful if everyone could just leave everyone else alone."

What's sad are those people who believe Brownback actually took any sort of stand at all, other than to point at the Bill of Rights and nod his head sagely."
kansas,3cghar,Arclight,-2,Wed Jul 8 23:28:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, you mean like it protected Sweet Cakes Bakery in Oregon? Or Elane Photography in New Mexico? The 1st A will only protect you from the state if, and only if, you are not operating in the public sphere (where this particular issue is concerned). Based on those two ruling, particularly Elane Photography v Willock, there will be no religious exempting, as it is now considered illegal discrimination."
kansas,3cghar,Barton_Foley,3,Wed Jul 8 23:59:52 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware that Sweet Cakes Bakery in Oregon was a church, and that it's members were clergy. How about Elane Photography?  Kindly sod off with this reactionary drivel. Brownback's pronouncement was intended to convince people that HE would protect the clergy. Which is utter and complete bullshit."
kansas,3cghar,Arclight,-1,Thu Jul 9 01:19:35 2015 UTC,"Please explain to me how, a church or clergy members, would not be subject to the judgement as laid down in Elaine. You claimed the 1st A would protect such a sincere religious belief. If such refusal is considered discrimination, how would the 1st A provide an exemption to an church or clergy member refusing to provide what is now a civil right under the 14th A? The 1st A does not discriminate between churches, clergy or individuals. Previous SCOTUS rulings such as   Goldman v. Weinberger, Cantwell v. Connecticut, Wisconsin v. Yoder, and Wolman v. Walters  indicate that when there is a compelling government interest, no Establishment Clause exception or protections apply. So, again I ask, how will the 1st A provide the protections you claim it will?"
kansas,3cghar,Barton_Foley,3,Thu Jul 9 01:44:53 2015 UTC,"Because in each and every instance in the cases you rely on as citations, the ""compelling government interest"" was clearly applied for government services - and not for religious organizations performing their own ceremonies.   The Elaine case is clearly leveled at compelling civic government organizations to provide equal protections, and NOT churches, clergy or religious organizations.   Your attempt and comparing apples to oranges is an utter failure, a non sequiter of the highest order, and nothing more than a straw man that has nothing whatsoever to do with the SCOTUS ruling in particular.   Check your case law carefully, and you'll find in particular, in each and every instance, that government services and NOT churches were impacted by the court's ruling.   Your argument also lacks warrant and backing when it comes to the ""compelling government interest"". It's incumbent on you to provide an argument in which the Sherbert test could be successfully applied, and which the Lemon test might be bypassed.   So, in effect, the SOLE plank of your argument is nothing more than a slippery slope fallacy.   Again...nothing but blatant fear-mongering, and an attempt at using utterly irrelevant and misapplied legal citations to support an imaginary case that has nothing to do with the law you attempt to use as precedence.   Nothing about this holds water.   Nothing."
kansas,3cghar,Arclight,-1,Thu Jul 9 02:13:39 2015 UTC,"So, providing civil marriage ceremonies and licenses is not a government service subcontracted out to religious organizations?   And, the answer is ""yes"" to all the Lemon criteria.  And the Sherbert test is no longer considered good case law because of the RFRA. Which, as we have seen, is no longer a protection in cases such as this as the findings show that exemptions are not required to be given by the state.   So, what your saying is that a sincere religious belief would allow churches and clergy to essentially discriminate against a class of people?  As a minarchist, I agree with this on principle, but somehow I do not think you share the same idea based upon your previous posts. Even if we do agree, I still argue that the current body of case law I cited is correct in the matter considering that the civil portion of a marriage is a government service, even though a subcontracted one. There will be no exemption in this matter.   I will glad to be incorrect in this matter, but I fully believe that I am not and that there is an unfortunate conflict brewing between the 1st and 14th A."
kansas,3cghar,Barton_Foley,2,Thu Jul 9 02:19:42 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'm saying. Rabbi's aren't forced to conduct marriages between Jews and non-Jews. Catholic priests can't be forced to marry two divorced people. Religion is entirely and completely free to discriminate willy-nilly within the confines of the religious services they provide.   You can't deny a marriage license for an interracial couple. But you're certainly free to refuse to conduct the church ceremony.   It's the state that's not allowed to discriminate in how it provides its services.   The most that could happen is that clergy would lose their ability to issue civil marriage licenses - which as you nicely pointed out is a government service subcontracted from the state...and is entirely separate from the religious ceremony itself.   As far as the RFRA is concerned, it was overturned on a national level as it applied to the states. The state's own RFRA's are still on the books. And the national RFRA is still applied in cases involving the Federal government.   Churches, and their clergy will not be forced to marry gays. The sole impact they might face is the loss to administer the civil contract between the two people...which is NOT a ""religious freedom""."
kansas,3cghar,Arclight,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:34:36 2015 UTC,"I think we are talking past one another here. I began this conversation arguing that the power of the state would be brought to bear on those who did not provide those services, I did not, and do not, believe that churches and clergy will be forced, say by lawsuits, to conform and provide religious ceremonies for gay couples (not in the US anyhow). However, the point I was trying to make, apparently poorly, is that  the judiciary and regulatory power of the state will be focused on those who overtly refuse. I fully agree with everything you wrote above and wonder exactly how we ended up locking horns. I shall chalk it up to my own inarticulateness."
kansas,3cghar,Barton_Foley,4,Thu Jul 9 02:49:43 2015 UTC,"what is so telling in your misunderstanding of this situation is the suggestion that religious institutions might end up being forced to perform ""the civil portion of a marriage ceremony."" the civil and religious aspects are already clearly delineated and one is not required for the other nor sufficient to replace it.  your post reeks of the ""lavender scare"" touted in the 1950's - almost everyone is actually happy and perfect but the activist fringe will stop at nothing to convince you otherwise and corrupt your children!"
kansas,3cghar,designer_of_drugs,0,Wed Jul 8 12:17:59 2015 UTC,"To each his own, I agree! I guess I'm mostly afraid that our deeply religious elected officials, of whom Brownback is exemplar, will somehow extend this order to justify quasi-criminal actions promulgated by holy men dressed as politicians leading a faithful electorate."
kansas,3cghar,Brownbacked,2,Wed Jul 8 03:52:46 2015 UTC,"I wonder whether it's ever painful to be on the wrong side of history and look back later. SCOTUS issues a ""loving v. virginia"" opinion on gay marriage, and Brownback et al continue to wave the confederate flag over it.  Every time you see one of these statements or orders continuing to argue settled law, one just needs to substitute the word ""interracial"" for or ""black"" for ""same-sex"", and every time, it would be disastrous for any politician to make that same statement about race. In ten or twenty years, people are going to look back at Brownback, Jindal and others like they're the George Wallaces of gay rights."
kansas,3cghar,cyberphlash,2,Wed Jul 8 15:15:54 2015 UTC,The Executive Order recognizes that the protection of religious liberty from government infringement is a fundamental state interest and complements the protections of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Section Seven of the Bill of Rights of the Kansas Constitution.   Don't forget this goes both ways. Freedom of religion can also mean freedom from religion.

I have a thought that Brownback's cronies will probably try to hold off revisiting the food sales tax until they can ""see how the credit system works out."" And then declare it an unqualified success."

One went well - our cat had a head injury (it turned out she feel from an unsteady perch and hit her head on a wooden gate.)  They worked hard to figure out what was going on and kept her for two days.  I thought the price was fair.  The second incident was not great - our 80 pound dog tossed our 7 pound dog aside and severely injured her shoulder.  I was very concerned about the amount of pain Lily was in and also very worried about her going into shock.  We got in to the clinic at 2:00am and she was not seen until after 8am.  The resident came out for about five minutes, but did nothing to ease Lily's pain.  She clearly could not manage the caseload and either could not get support or refused to ask.  This experience has made me concerned about using them again.  If you are considering a major surgery, I would ask for an estimated quote and also make sure you understand who will be performing the surgery and how your pet will be cared for in off-hours.  Good luck!"

Mainly because most people don't realize just how much trouble actually using a gun to stop a crime can cause.  Ya if someone breaks I to hour house you could shoot them but you will still probably be arrested or at least taken to jail and then there will be court cases and lawyer fees.  The conceal carry class I went to made sure you understood that if you did end up using a weapon in a lf defence that you would still probably end up spending nearly $10000 in legal and court fees even if you didn't break any laws.

We'll just assume they're great drivers once they get behind the wheel.  That's exactly what just happened with guns.  How reasonable is it that the public will be more more safe when more guns are being toted around by people with little to no training, and where laws increasingly let them off the hook for accidentally shooting someone?  ""What do you mean, they could've prevented Sandy Hook!"" you say. Concealed gun carry is already available, so where are the thousands of examples of bystanders playing a positive role in preventing death to offset the thousands of deaths where guns are ""accidentally"" fired?  Sure, there's a few stories you can point to, but the overwhelming evidence shows that the presence of a gun in a household or public space, by itself, significantly increases the chances of someone there dying, not due to crime, but from accidental use or because it's readily available in instances like domestic disputes.

The bottom line is that it's a fundamental right to be able to protect yourself, that's all this law has done, is given people the ability to protect themselves outside of their homes.  Your example of driving is apples to oranges as nobody has the right to drive, it has to be earned.  People have a right to defend themselves.  If they want to go out without proper training, they'll be dealing with the consequences of their actions.  I'm not one to ask the government to protect people from their own stupidity, otherwise, we'll just have more idiots running around reproducing."

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

The simple reason being the requirement for courts to justify their decisions based on fact and findings that have some merit. The legislature is under no such restrictions. If the KS courts deem funding inadequate there must be some reasonable basis for said decision. If the legislature wants to deem school funding inadequate they can simply deem in inadequate. I think the court's determinations based on points of fact is one of the biggest checks on legislative and executive power.

I sort of went along with the whole ""homosexuality = bad"" thing because it was how I was raised, but even at its worst, I never understood why people made such a big deal out of it like gay people were going to take over the world and make everyone gay (some people really believe this).  It just absolutely blows my mind that it's the 21st goddamn century and people still waste time and energy preventing gay people from being equal. Just... give it a rest.  This is a good day."

kansas,3b7f3g,lookthruglasses,2,Fri Jun 26 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I always figured the big cities in Kansas might have a little more tolerance for gays. Growing up in a small western Kansas town,  I (and most everyone I grew up with) were never taught that homosexuals were ""bad"". Although we did consider them weird or odd. Sure, we used gay slurs as often as we could in highschool, but since we had only knew gays from TV shows and movies I just figured we were a little more ignorant than you big city folk.  However, I do remember now that we did have a gay kid in my high school. He was a couple of years ahead of me and was pretty flamboyant (for a small farming community anyway) and I honestly can't remember anyone ever harassing him or bullying him, though I can't say for certain that it never happened.   I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm surprised at the attitude of the people of this state. Its surpising that a town full of macho farmers and ranchers, who had a relatively small amount of exposure to gay culture, can be so much more...... tolerant?  Ok rambling complete."

I grew up there, spent 20 years of my life in a town that very loudly proclaimed against anything that might possibly improve anyones quality of life.   The most vivid thing I recall is the utterly despicable campaign to unseat then-Mayor Elma Broadfoot. The most popular bumper sticker of that time was pretty illustrative of the mentality ""Ditch the Bitch"".   They've got zero problems with shooting abortion doctors, and bent themselves over backwards to accommodate the idiotic ""Summer of Mercy"".   The school board was at the forefront of evolution denial, the police had to struggle with the aftermath of the Hermann Hill Park riot in the 70's, and the city council was something of a joke.

It was always told by Chief Burnett that the mound must not be disturbed because it was a sacred place watched over by the Great Spirit and those who have past on must always be respected. The people of Kansas believed that by respecting the Chief's wishes that the mound would protect the city of Topeka from the devastating power of tornadoes.  In 1960, Chief Burnett's mound was disturbed with construction at its base for an interstate bypass. Upon Burnett's Mound itself, it was cut into at the top of its north side, perfectly visual for all Topekans to view as its desecration continued to fit a 5 million gallon steel drum reservoir water tank. In the following years, building began to slowly progress around Burnett's Mound.   At 6:55PM on June 8, 1966, a tornado of immense power struck the city of Topeka, destroying all within its path. It lasted 34 minutes ending at 7:29PM. The F5 tornado was a half mile wide, as about 820 homes were destroyed and 3,000 damaged. Entire blocks were leveled to splinters in seconds. The tornado's violent winds had estimated at around 300 mph.   Total cost was put at $100,000,000.00 making it at the time the costliest tornado in American history. Even to this day, with inflation factored in, the Topeka tornado still stands as one of the costliest on record. The tornado claimed 16 lives, injured over 500 people, and left over 3500 homeless."

It was a post office in Larabee Township, Gove County, Kansas,[1] and folded in 1923. Oakley is the closest community that matches the fictional Jericho's apparent location, and some route numbers from the ""official"" CBS map of Jericho match, but Oakley is almost entirely in Logan County.""  http://jericho.wikia.com/wiki/Jericho,_Kansas"

kansas,3apgsy,andrewplatham,9,Mon Jun 22 13:57:28 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, I've spoken with a few natives of that town who are quite upset that this was done as more of a symbolic thing, instead of a true rebuilding. They're frustrated that many long-time residents and families had to move out, or are making much less than they were, since they can't sustain the additional cost of living that the new technology has brought.  Not trying to start a politics flame war here - just relaying a story."
kansas,3apgsy,catmanus,9,Mon Jun 22 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"Would you know what the extra costs are? I'd be worried about false causation. Their population dropped in half after the tornado to 750 or so. That was before any of the buildings got rebuilt. Without major players coming in and financing the rebuilding of the town, you could have had the population drop to fewer than 300.  I was just in Greensburg last month. I spent money at the convenience store and hotel. I would not have given my money to the locals if there was no tornado to go through the town because it would have just been another town out of a thousand in Kansas."
kansas,3apgsy,andrewplatham,5,Mon Jun 22 20:17:30 2015 UTC,"This was several years ago - but from what I remember, there were dictated building materials or processes that were more environmentally friendly.  And many folks didn't feel as if they could afford that investment.  So, yes, false causation is definitely a possibility.  And there's the ""small town native who doesn't want the new mall in town"" mentality at play too.  Again - relaying a story with all the caveats.  :)"

If you're in KC you could... catch a Royal's game, check out the Country Club Plaza, see downtown (Power & Light district), get some roller coaster time in (World's of Fun/Ocean's of Fun), visit some of our lakes, visit some of the new gaming bars (updown?).  If you're going through Wichita, Club Rodeo is always worth a visit. Live bull riding in a bar. It's an experience. They might have an exotic animal zoo if I remember correctly.  If you're visiting Lawrence you could check out Allen Fieldhouse (Jayhawks Basketball) and Mass Street.  If you're going through Manhattan/Junction City, you could visit the Calvary Museum. It's surprisingly neat. Aggieville (KSU bar district) is pretty awesome too.  I always love the little restaurants in some of Kansas' small towns. There are some hidden gems.

Tweeting from his KU faculty twitter was inexcusable, as was wishing death on kids, but had a student got in to a twitter war and the grade was negatively affected then the student has an absolute grievance (I work for a college and deal with this from time to time, is this mistake free? nope, but I work to get as close as we can) I dont know anything about the professor thought his statement was uncouth at best and yes while I do agree that if you use university social media accounts yo should adhere to policy, the KBOR policy extends to personal accounts as well, and is vague pretty much leaving what is 'offensive' in the hands of one's boss, so, in effect, you can say a) this man gave KBOR the excuse to enact what in my opinion is an overreach in to private lives or B) a huge overreaction to the actions of one idiot.  My job in these situations is to ask several questions. Is this a rash moment? Has this man been warned before about his actions? How aggregious was his statement (wishing death on kids is pretty high on that list for me) and more and more.   On the tenure/freedom of speech to protect academic expression, I will say this as my opinion (and I reserve the right to change my opinion upon hearing other ideas) What he said did not fall in to academic expression. I am of the opinion that academic freedom should be absolute. Academic freedom encompasses medicines, ideas, theories and more in everything from business to history to medical, and touchy subjects have to be dealt with and if a researcher does not have absolute freedom to discuss, question, challenge and idea or theory, how can they and we improve upon it? People will get offended, and that is ok.  So, for me, what I felt like with this professor is what a dumbass thing to say, and when KBOR reacted my feelings were what a silly thing to do.  I quite honestly appreciate your two cents. I love hearing other people feelings and ideas on things, you definatley gave me some thought for food and I do appreciate that."

I've read article after article about Brownback's failed policies and can see a general frustration with the situation, but I rarely see anything about actual Kansans protesting, demonstrating, demanding action from their legislators... Is any of that actually happening?  Is there anyone to run against all the legislators who voted these policies into effect?  It's easy to point out the problems (especially in this case) but is everyone who wants to change the situation already gone from the state?"

I went online to check local news channels and I can see the PR machine of the ALEC group already at work talking about how it really isn't that much....less than .40 cents for every hundred dollars. Makes it sound very reasonable until you go to the store and realize that all sales tax combined and raised since 2012 means for every 100 dollars, you will be paying 10.00 just in taxes in some places. So for a family that conservatively spends 100.00 dollars a week on groceries, that family will be paying 40.00 a month just in sales taxes. Now add in the higher income taxes due to the cuts in deductibles and it doesn't take long to realize that if you are poor or especially a struggling middle-income family, your taxes in total will be going up a lot."

Where are those supposed ""saving grace"" funds being wasted?"
kansas,3a1jn3,barn9,2,Thu Jun 18 03:02:38 2015 UTC,"casino monies   The State has done so much foot dragging and basically making casinos legal, but at the same time a total pain in the ass to operate, there really isn't much there.  For instance, South East Kansas still doesn't have a casino but there are at least 4 casinos a stone's throw from the border in Oklahoma (one is literally an actual stone's throw, since the back end of it's parking lot actually crosses the State line into Kansas) that have been reaping millions and millions dollars for years.  Meanwhile, Kansas has managed to have 2 operators back out of building a Kansas casino, forced a guy who used to run a dog track and wanted slot machines at his facility to close down, and they are still jacking around looking at proposals.  Meanwhile, the Oklahoma casinos continue to make money hand over fist.  And if your idea of ""saving grace"" is depending on state citizens to throw money away buying lottery tickets, you really are scraping the bottom of the barrel."
kansas,3a1jn3,Four_Months,2,Tue Jun 16 16:04:18 2015 UTC,"The lottery and casinos were touted as the saving grace for schools and highways as I remember (or at least some people in KS gov't thought so).  They are bringing in money to the state (supposedly), yet it seems the schools in Kansas are in a worse state than ever.  Not sure if anything will help the highway dept., they can squander more the more that comes in with no problem the way that dept. operates.  The gist of it all is that there needs to be some explaining done about where all the money is going, and I never seem to hear anything to that effect."

Next, they have some of the craziest right wing religious nutjobs as their legislators, who voted for the sales tax hike despite their own retail business constituents.  And, finally, JoCo has the easiest route of escaping the consequences of that sales tax hike by making a short drive into KC Mo.

As a whole, people there have always felt that they should be allowed to just raise their income tax very slightly and fund schools, something KCK and most of the state can't do (because their real estate just isn't worth as much and its owners don't have much money).    On the other hand the rural districts voting overwhelmingly for Brownback puzzle me.  Joco was 50/50 on Brownback, but Western Kansas was more like 80/20.    Yeah Douglas, Riley, and a handful of others were trumpeting the reasonable tax policy plan, but let's not act like the whole rest of the state wanted to be reasonable.  So yeah, fuck them and all that, but at least their votes make sense."

The bigger argument here is the writing has been on the wall since 2012.  Kansas cannot survive with no income taxes because we have nothing to replace it.  Brownback is a fanatic who's handlers are telling him that trickle-down economics will work if he gives it enough time.

Texas and Alaska make billions every year from gas and oil royalties, Florida and Wyoming get their money from tourism, Nevada from gambling, etc.  Kansas has none of these additional revenue forms, at least not in any capacity that could replace income taxes.

The real issue here is the people who have to budget each month now having to change their budget and possibly cut out essentials because of a tax cut that didn't work.  Brownback should have just repealled or lessened the amount t of the tax cut not punish everyone because his plans failed, its assinine and this is kansas's far right wing crazies throwing a temper tantrum.   Kansas has always been a right down the middle of the road moderate state but we swung far right in the last few years and I think we are now realizing that the only things on the far right and far left are wishes and nut jobs."

kansas,3a1efg,Yacko_75,3,Tue Jun 16 13:54:42 2015 UTC,"This is hardly news to most economists. Make oodles of loanable funds available and companies will use it if there is demand. Create profitable demand, and companies will race to supply it.  Couple this with the fact that the poor spend every penny they make, and middle class spend most (propensity to consume). Republicans concentration on Supply Side is simply a disguise to provide tax breaks to the wealthy, ""trickle down"" (no such term in actual economics) does not work well.   In national politics this policy does tend to create a Keynesian boost since you spend more than you take in, but runs up a huge deficit, à la Reagan and Bush. But most (all?) states are required to have a balanced budget so it does not work. Note that Brownback has already taken out huge loans (bonds), but with interest rates this low, it was probably a smart move.  Is supply side important? Yes, companies will not build if they will not make money, and they need access to affordable capital. This has not been an issue in many years.  The other issue is where taxes go. People move for jobs, but most people also want to live in places with nice amenities like good roads, parks, great schools, etc. These take taxes and a desire to create them."

The senator noted that threats of who would vote for who, tithing to groups of senators to assure a vote, and threats from the executive branch had ""made him sick"" but left him with no options but to vote yes.  The tactic that has been employed against Kansas Senators and House members has been hardball. In caucus yesterday, Governor Brownback let it be known that if  nothing happened by Monday, he would line item veto all funding from regents universities. A move that would put significant financial stress on the obligations of major universities; but unbearable financial stress on secondary institutions like Emporia State - which hails from Sen. Longbine's district.  In the end, Sam Brownback made the threat:  Brownback message to Republicans-Do it my way or I shoot the hostages (school kids, college kids, disabled) #ksleg  Fucking do it. Grow some balls and stand up. You're getting fucked either way, and now they can leave the hand up your ass, because you've been compromised.

It is a good time to be moving to the area. Dodge is the entertainment city of SW Kansas, they have an casino and arena which draws in decent shows now and again, and generally the city has much more focus on ""fun things"" than the other cities in the area. They just broke ground on a new water park, which should be ready to go for next summer. Not one, but two sushi places just opened up (not to mention all the great Mexican and various Asian food we have in the area).   Some negatives:   Garden City is much more the retail hub in the area, with things like Sam's Club, Target, TJ Maxx, Home Dept, Menards, Old Chicago, Buffalo Wild Wings (soon), etc.  It kind of all evens out as GC people go to Dodge for entertainment and Dodge people go to Garden to shop.  It's a quick 45 minute drive between the two cities, and it really isn't that bad - I'd rather do that then drive across a major city. Even though all of SWKS is conservative, Dodge seems to be the is the most red, while Garden is the least and Liberal is somewhere in the middle.  But I don't think you would have a problem being liberal in any of the cities out here -just don't be a jerk about it.  (For example in Garden a senior barista at our Downtown coffee shop is openly gay and married, but I have never heard anything negative about it.  She doesn't flaunt it, but she doesn't hide it either and they are regulars helping out with events around town so people know about it too.  I wouldn't think there would be a problem with this in Dodge either.)     In any case we're glad you are making the move out here, and hope you get along well.

Of course that isn't to say that the heat may not get frustrating or that you will not miss a view of the mountains, tall trees, or hills but it isn't as if you will never see those things. Just traveling a few hours west toward Denver will get you the mountains or even up toward the capital you'll start getting in to the flint hills.   I haven't been to Dodge City so I can't say much as far as the town or people go but I grew up in Manhattan and have family in Russell, Wichita, Marysville, Sabetha, and Blue Rapids.

If it's from a large metropolitan area, you're in for some rather major culture shock. There aren't nearly as many entertainment, and dining opportunities in a place like Dodge City as you'd find in Wichita, Manhattan, Lawrence or KC.  Out west like that limits you, and you'll need a pretty good car - because you're looking at drives of a couple of hours to get to anywhere that has some kind of metro culture.   The countryside is nice out that way...a bit flat in Western Kansas and Eastern Colorado. And the weather can actually be pretty exciting. Kansas thunderstorms are pretty damn interesting.   If you're conservative politically...you'll fit in. If not...Western Kansas isn't the place to be a liberal, so avoid getting yourself ostracized right off the bat.   Aside from that...folks out that way tend to be pretty kind and friendly. It's an open ""country"" sort of vibe that's pretty neighborly for the most part.   Good luck."

It remains illegal in many places because of 80 years of mostly false propaganda and corporate greed.

kansas,39n2jn,snikrepab_,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:27:25 2015 UTC,"In case there is a pay wall,   The Senate joined the House by approving a session-ending bill Friday making adjustments to legislation imposing a state tax increase of $432 million next year that constitutes the largest in Kansas history.  Public begging and private bullying that defined the session's votes on tax policy prompted adoption by the bare minimum -- 21 votes in the Senate, 63 in the House -- of legislation  endorsed by Gov. Sam Brownback and designed to respond to a projected $400 million deficit in the fiscal year starting July 1.  The House came up with a slightly different mix of tax additions than was passed Sunday by the Senate, which required the upper chamber to vote on a bill matching the House action. That bill was in peril on Friday afternoon until Sen. Rob Olson, R-Olathe, changed his vote to ""yes"" and provided the ending margin.  In recent days, heavy political muscle was applied to GOP lawmakers to vote for a tax increase or face a primary election opponent in August 2016.  The Brownback administration also triggered a public backlash by declaring failure to raise taxes could result in sweeping budget reductions in Kansas higher education.  The battle to frame the tax increase in a politically palatable way erupted on the Senate and House floors.   ""I view this as tax reform, not a tax hike,"" said Sen. Julia Lynn, an Olathe Republican who voted for the measure.   Sen. Jeff Longbine, R-Emporia, said the tax package was deficient in many ways but voted for the legislation because it might not improve if the session was prolonged. He denounced tactics used to persuade legislators to vote for revenue enhancements.   ""We've had blackmail from the executive branch to the legislative branch,"" he said. ""We've had blackmail within this body.""   Brownback, in a meeting Thursday with Republicans in the House and Senate, said he was desperate to make a deal.   ""I'm pleading with you, really,"" he said.   That GOP gathering helped inspire passage by the House of a two bills revising tax law, but likely requiring Brownback to take a knife to state spending in the next fiscal year. The chamber slipped over the hurdle around 4 a.m. Friday after hard-core conservatives who had stiff-armed leadership and the governor for weeks folded.   ""Colleagues, we’ve had a long session, but our diligence has paid off and we’re making an additional $50 million in cuts to the budget,"" said Rep. Steve Brunk, R-Wichita. ""Our goal is to enact a long-term stable and predictable revenue source to provide necessary services while protecting taxpayers’ pocketbooks. This bill accomplishes that.”   Though dozens of Republicans ended up voting to raises taxes -- some in violation of anti-tax pledges -- some couldn't hide their displeasure.  Rep. John Whitmer, a Wichita Republican, spoke through tears as he explained his ""yes"" vote.   ""I voted for something I am not proud of,"" Whitmer said, ""but I feel it's what the folks need.""   The legislation retained a business tax exemption Brownback delivered to 330,000 businesses in 2012, but raised the statewide sales tax to 6.5 percent from 6.15 percent on all purchases. A provision dropping the sales tax on food to 5.95  percent was withdrawn by Republicans who want to consider that adjustment in advance of the 2016 elections for House and Senate.   ""It gives us the highest sales tax rate on food in the nation. Low-income people will be paying the highest rate in the nation,"" said Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, D-Topeka. ""Brownback's tax policy is Robin Hood in reverse. He steals from the poor to benefit the rich.""   House Minority Leader Tom Burroughs, D-Kansas City, said Republicans were dedicated to adding $164 million to the sales tax, wiping out $97 million in itemized deductions and boosting the cigarette tax by $40 million.   ""We are literally increasing the cost of living in Kansas on those who can afford it least,"" Burroughs said.   The plan would freeze state income tax rates at 2.7 percent and 4.6 percent through 2017, which saves the state $26  million. The deal also dropped language requiring all Kansas sales tax exemptions to expire in four years.  The session has consumed 113 days -- longest in state history and well beyond the standard 90-day session.  The break in House gridlock followed warnings by the Brownback administration that savage cuts would be made in the state university system and the state's bond ratings would collapse absent a compromise about Republicans.  Brownback and the GOP-controlled House and Senate struggled to respond to a budget deficit that trailed approval of the elimination of state income tax on limited liability companies and other businesses as well as the reduction of individual income tax rates. The bill contains a $24 million hit on these business entities, but the presumption is savvy accountants could help most owners avoid the hit.  The higher sales tax would be implemented July 1, but businesses wouldn't be obligated to assess that rate for 30 days. That could clip the state for one month of the projected revenue increase from the sales tax by $13 million.  The legislation also depends on the Kansas Department of Revenue pulling in $30 million this fall with a tax amnesty program for people who have dodge taxes.  The two bills now in play with the House and Senate would raise $384.6 million annually for the state, but a separate piece of legislation sent to Brownback would deliver $47.8 million from a new tax on managed care organizations in Kansas."

They are evil"" at one point, which brought strong approval from the anti-tax ralliers in the balcony.""  John Rubin spent 10 years as a Social Security Administrative Law Judge. Taxes paid for his salary as well as those of his clerk, and everything else associated with his office.  John Rubin served for 3 years as a JAG Corps officer with the Navy during Vietnam. Taxes paid for his salary along with those of his co-workers, and everything else associated with literally everything related to this position.  John Rubin worked in a civilian capacity...as an attorney-advisor specializing in contract and procurement law for the KC District of the US Army Corp of Engineers. While he was a civilian and presumably paid by a private company, his work was directly related to offices paid for by taxes.  John Rubin was a labor lawyer and senior litigator for the KC Region of the Federal Labor Relations Authority. We might assume this was a privately funded position, but again, taxes pay for everything related to the Federal Labor Relations Authority.  John Rubin was chosen to serve as Assistant Regional Counsel at the KC Regional Office of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and attorney-advisor at the US Penitentiary in Leavenworth. Sensing a pattern here yet? While at this position, he completed self defense and weapons firing classes at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia.  John was THEN the senior litigator for the KC Region of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Later, he was appointed as Regional Counsel of the FDIC's Atlanta Regional Office.  John was later appointed by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a  United States Administrative Law Judge, serving in this capacity with the Social Security Administration in KC.  And of course he has been in the Kansas legislature since 2011.  Nearly every single point of this mans professional life has been tied to some level of government - and taxes - in some way.

My friend had a foster baby once that was born addicted to meth. She took care of a newborn, meth addicted baby for the first 4 weeks of his life. The mom had a live-in boyfriend that was a known drug dealer and he was returned to his mother after she attended 2 AA meetings.  Want more stories like that? I've got several. She and her husband fostered half a dozen kids last year that were delivered in the middle of the night because parents were arrested for one thing or another.

Incumbent Republican Governor Sam Brownback ran for re-election to a second term.

The consensus among The Cook Political Report, Governing, The Rothenberg Political Report, Sabato's Crystal Ball, Daily Kos Elections, and others was that the contest was a tossup.

kansas,3922s3,RedditRage,0,Tue Jun 9 04:26:06 2015 UTC,It just makes me feel like the gini coefficient of the district would be kinda high. The KCK district has one of the highest administration costs per student of all the districts in the state. And the superintendent seems to be an outlier among school superintendents in how much effort she puts into her reaction to state funding.  I wish we had one reporter who would investigate that angle instead of allowing their innate bias to accept the story she gives without considering motives.  Good journalism is dead.
kansas,3922s3,mbevks,4,Tue Jun 9 13:26:37 2015 UTC,"The big thing that a lot people forget with administrative cost is that also includes on-staff social workers and case workers which USD 500 requires a lot of.   They are managing children who are wards to the state, finanical constraints and other major issues, which requires more individuals with a psych background, which are not cheap."
kansas,3922s3,antipinkkitten,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:13:53 2015 UTC,Do you know if KCK is worse in this regard than Garden City? I'll make a note to look-up the portion of USD 500's budget that goes toward social work.
kansas,3922s3,mbevks,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:01:35 2015 UTC,Consider other things like cost of living. People have to make money somehow.
kansas,3922s3,tech_0912,16,Wed Jun 10 18:12:15 2015 UTC,"Does Cynthia Lane get a daily stipend that covers all meals, haircuts, and clothes? Does she have lobbyist flying her out to ""speaking events"" at 5 star resorts? (or events called educational retreats). Does Cynthia Lane get to use a private plane paid for by taxpayers?"
kansas,3922s3,Tbjkbe,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:18:48 2015 UTC,"Her pension alone exceeds the dollar costs of the mentioned items. And yes, she does get a travel stipend. But I wouldn't consider that alone to be unreasonable."
kansas,3922s3,mbevks,2,Tue Jun 9 12:59:04 2015 UTC,"What about his pension? If you are going to attack her for having a pension, you should also take a look at his as well. Plus he gets his pension if he only works for 4 years. ( I know he will have worked for 8 but if he was not re-elected, he would still get his pension)"
kansas,3922s3,Tbjkbe,-1,Tue Jun 9 16:13:37 2015 UTC,"This is true but the superintendent will have a much larger pension, if you are comparing.  At this point I'm not really trying to make an argument, but it is interesting to know that a district superintendent makes that much more than the governor in salary."
kansas,3922s3,mbevks,2,Tue Jun 9 20:36:49 2015 UTC,"She has to earn her pension by putting in years and years of work. She also most likely has a Phd in Education, started out as an entry teacher herself and with lots of hours and hard work,  rose to the position in which she currently is in.  I also do not believe the Gov. of Kansas makes that little without receiving a lot of other benefits.  Take a look at a medium sized city manager. They probably make more than the governor.  So if the pay is so low, why would anyone want the position? (I know it is about power and all that, just saying there are other things than just a yearly salary)"
kansas,3922s3,Tbjkbe,2,Tue Jun 9 21:45:13 2015 UTC,"I see no reason why her retirement should be so much more grand than the average public school teacher. The average superintendent is outlasted by one governor's term. The standard formula is to score a sweet contract, rake in the cash, quit before the job is done, and move on to your next target.  Getting a PhD in education isn't comparable to most PhD's. Education majors consistently score in the bottom quartile on the GRE. Having dual majored for my undergrad in engineering and education, I can attest to there being a huge difference in average intelligence between the two groups."
kansas,3922s3,mbevks,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:36:32 2015 UTC,"So you have a PhD in education? And it wasn't as hard or is as valued as other degree's? Please enlighten us all with your experience being a Superintendent.  As for your logic that most Superintendents only work an average of years as a Gov.? Please tell me where you pulled that statistic from?   Here is what I think you did. You looked at the average years a Superintendent works in a District without looking or considering their total years in the education field. The average Superintendent starts as a beginning teacher and then teacher for several years. Then they will get promoted to an administrative position, most likely a vice-principle or principle. They will work that job for several years before they move up to the Superintendent position. Since they are a new superintendent, they will most likely get a job in a small school and work their way up to a position at one of the largest schools. Add on top of all of that, in the educational field, you can not collect your pension called KPERS unless you reach the 85 rule. This rule means the years of experience is added to your age. If it is 85 or higher, you can take retirement.   Let's take a look at her experience:  http://kckps.org/index.php/superintendent It look like she has over 30 years in the education field."
kansas,3922s3,Tbjkbe,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"Just checked your link....yep, what I thought. You are only looking at their average tenure in ONE district. You are forgetting that Superintendents don't usually stay in one district their entire career. They move to other districts. Doesn't mean they are not still working as a Superintendent. They don't last long in a district due to money, politics coming from the community, or prospect of moving up to a bigger school. Some leave due to time commitments."
kansas,3922s3,Tbjkbe,2,Wed Jun 10 04:17:22 2015 UTC,"Superintendents are like corporate officers of the big greedy corporations. How they climb the corporate ladder, how they move from one place to another, how they negotiate salaries & benefits-- it is all so similar. That's why I said, ""The standard formula is to score a sweet contract, rake in the cash, quit before the job is done, and move on to your next target."""
kansas,3922s3,mbevks,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:08:10 2015 UTC,"I do see where you are coming from but again I do have to disagree with one of your statements. CEO's by and large work with data that is all about maximize profit for them and their shareholders. Their salaries are often a lot higher than Superintendents and no one blinks an eye when they cut payroll and then collect a million dollar bonus.  Superintendents work with data not to maximize profit but to maximize education for students. They worry about the budget not so they can make more money for themselves or a few shareholders but so the school can continue to function at a level that the community expects it to function. Superintendents main job is ensure all students in the district receive an adequate education. They manage a budget they have no direct control over. They have many, many regulations they must not only be aware of but must follow while balancing the needs of teachers, staff, and students. They don't get a bonus for cutting payroll. And they are held to a high scrutiny by the community with everyone, most that have never stepped foot in a classroom, telling them what they are doing wrong."

kansas,3922s3,mbevks,6,Tue Jun 9 01:53:19 2015 UTC,Exactly. The taxpayers are getting screwed by the Cons' assault on education.

kansas,3922s3,mbevks,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:49:03 2015 UTC,"There are just a couple reasons for that question. * You have actively been avoiding information about the Kansas budget and finances since at least 2012 * You are a troll * You believe (through either malice or stupidity) that what the ultra rightwing Republicans in the state (and elsewhere) is right and/or will work.  We can rule out the first one, since you're in a thread about that very same issue. Neither of the other two would result in you being actually interested in an answer."
kansas,3922s3,tribrn,-2,Wed Jun 10 01:40:48 2015 UTC,"Option #4, I don't believe that public schools do a very good job transferring skills necessary to participate in the economy and I do not understand why spending less on such an endeavor would ""screw"" me over.  Now you can answer the question or you can avoid it."
kansas,3922s3,mbevks,3,Wed Jun 10 01:57:58 2015 UTC,"It's probable that we have not stumbled upon the best method for educating the youth, but it's more equitable than forcing everybody into private schools if they can afford it. Maybe our public schools are terrible. One surefire way to make them worse is to strangle them to death, especially by pulling funding after the school year is 80% over.  Brownback et al are also assaulting the courts, women's rights, gay rights, voting access, and municipal self rule."

kansas,3922s3,TheBurningBeard,4,Tue Jun 9 01:01:03 2015 UTC,"Steve Jobs famously became quite wealthy earning a $1 salary at Apple. Some jobs come with benefits other than salary that are extremely valuable, and governors have a lot of benefits.   38k is too low for a job that requires at least four years of college, and while Cynthia's salary is not out of line with other industries, the overall administration costs at many schools is simply too high compared to what is making it into the classroom."
kansas,3922s3,sunflowerfly,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"and governors have a lot of benefits.    The potential to become a well-paid lobbyist or being groomed for a federal job are probably the two advantages that stick out.   38k is too low for a job that requires at least four years of college   I absolutely agree. I would also suggest you could get the same quality without requiring a 4-year college degree. A trade program would probably work well for K-8.  Or we could upgrade the quality of our teachers by competing with STEM professions for quality individuals.   the overall administration costs at many schools is simply too high compared to what is making it into the classroom.    I always wondered what the result would be of an experiment whereby a teacher gets the per capita per student and then is permitted to spend it as she wants, provided she gets equal or better results. My guess is that every teacher gets a stiff pay raise."
kansas,3922s3,mbevks,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:56:18 2015 UTC,"Okay.   There are 309 school districts in the state of Kansas.   Let's assume that every single one of them is administered by someone earning the same salary as Cynthia Lane.   This gives us an annual expense of $72, 606, 039.00.   Let's round that up to $73 million dollars in administrative expenses for the year.   That's out of a 2015 budget of...several billion (including local contributions to the overall expenses)?  That's not a lot, is it? Especially considering that quite a few district Administrators make a lot less than she does.   It's entirely possible that I've utterly screwed up the math, because I've been drinking a lot of Buffalo Trace this evening."

kansas,38zihz,jpebcac,6,Mon Jun 8 03:45:09 2015 UTC,"Looks like the plan is to increase the Sin tax, subsidize private schools, and charge people who buy things in KS more than in MO. How do we expect this to work?   It looks to me like we are encouraging people to not have children, shop in MO (if they are in KC), and save. All of which do not help KS long term, let alone short. To start, fewer kids means the KS economy won't grow nearly as well.   Sales taxes just punish those who need to buy things. People who have extra money have no reason to spend it right away, they can go places where taxes are lower to buy things, or they can buy online and KS can hope they do their taxes properly.  Sin taxes punish those who use the sins, cigarette smokers decrease as taxes increase. So I guess the law makers are at least looking out for someone. Smokers on the border are likely to cross state lines to buy cigarettes, I've known plenty of smokers and while I don't know price differences I know they will drive outside of their municipality for lower tax rates.   In short this looks like a great tax plan for people with money, who make a lot and spend it on the basics and save or travel. It looks like a pretty shitty deal for people who don't have extra money and are already living close to pay-check to pay-check.   Good luck guys!"
