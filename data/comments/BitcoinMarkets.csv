Don't know what's up with that.  EDIT: Dev mode works kind of, in the way that it connects and doesn't terminate the program - but it doesn't get any data and just gives me ""cannot compute a quote since no position report exists!"". Backtest mode terminates with 'EACCESS'.  EDIT 2: In the config.ts, the coinbase prod entries are missing the string declaration. Also, using https:// instead of wss:// for the websocketurl makes it work. The part should look like this:  public static get CoinbasePassphrase(): string { return ""NULL""; } public static get CoinbaseApiKey(): string { return ""NULL""; } public static get CoinbaseSecret(): string { return ""NULL""; } public static get CoinbaseRestUrl(): string { return ""https://api.exchange.coinbase.com""; } public static get CoinbaseWebsocketUrl(): string { return ""https://ws-feed.exchange.coinbase.com""; }   With this, it's working.  EDIT 3: Disregard that, it seems to have been a random fluke. I got it working once, but now it's not connecting again. Damn.  EDIT 4: Yeah, just try to start it a few times, it should work after a couple of tries. But I still get the ""cannot compute a quote since no position report exists!"". Hm."

BitcoinMarkets,3dup4y,Nlelith,2,Mon Jul 20 16:35:43 2015 UTC,"Coinbase is particularly finicky to get started correctly. As you've done, make sure that you have the correct credentials for their dev or prod environments. Their dev environment is nearly worthless, it never seems to work in the same way as their prod environment.  The way that it works is that the code goes out to get their full L3 snapshot and opens up the websocket, queues up any websocket messages, plays back the L3 snapshot then plays any websocket messages ontop of that. That's the way their docs tell us to do it, and the way I do it (which is largely taken from https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-exchange-node). I say all that because I'm fairly certain they may have race conditions on their end because sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I wouldn't be surprised if between the websocket starting and the L3 download, the L3 has a lower sequence number. I always used forever.js or supervisord with tribeca, so I never really noticed it. The app would continue retrying until I connected. I'll look into it if it becomes a bigger issue for people.  To your edit 4 point, you'll need to have some sort of position from the Coinbase API. I'm not sure if Coinbase dev actually provides position reports...  I can dig into this much more tonight."
BitcoinMarkets,3dup4y,Nlelith,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! Using the prod environment, I could get everything to work, after a few tries (and changing nothing, strangely). I now have to convince Coinbase to let me trade BTC/USD (I'm from Europe), and will explore your app further.   One more question, though: Under what conditions is the TBP 0? Because I do have a BTC balance, I'm getting price data, but the TBP remains 0."
BitcoinMarkets,3dup4y,TommyToad,2,Mon Jul 20 16:45:36 2015 UTC,"When using ""EwmaBasic"" apMode in the UI, the code will try to keep your BTC position as close to TBP (with some wiggle room, defined by pDiv). TBP works mainly by computing a crossing exponential weighted average of BTC prices to set a target position, so if you trade away too many BTC the code will start favoring buying them back and if BTC price is falling, you'll sell more than buy. I can't remember how long the windows are, maybe 200/100 minutes or hours. Since this is one of your first times running it, the app doesn't have any price history and should default to TBP of zero."

I specifically like the fact that your taking an inventory based risk approach and have a concept of safeties. Its missing a few features that would reduce its risk and improve profitability (normally seen in prop shops level app) but i can definitely see this making money in its current form .... i may even submit a pull request to add somethings if your taking them.  those looking at this might be wondering, ""why would i want to do this if ill only make 10-20 cents per trade"". the idea here is that it can make thousands of trades a week , trying to capture a large percentage of the volume and make xtrades * size * 20 cents profit. so it it make 1000 trades * 1 btc size youll make around 200 dollars a week automated.  A good rule of thumb to anyone thinking of running this is to open an account separate from your main trading account. this way if something goes hay wire - you dont blow your main account."
BitcoinMarkets,3dup4y,gynoplasty,2,Mon Jul 20 06:36:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking a look at the code! I'll definitely take and consider pull requests.  Coinbase's spreads are so thin that at some points I was doing nearly a thousand trades per day, but making a fraction of a penny per trade. It was always crazy to see that I was trading tens of thousands of USD value of BTC in the span of days or hours. Safeties and position controls therefore are crucial - one really bad trade can wipe out hundreds of small, good trades. I sometimes felt like I could never have enough of them - and that's where all the complexity of the app comes from now."

BitcoinMarkets,3dup4y,marcus13345,2,Mon Jul 20 17:06:18 2015 UTC,"The market data latency isn't super important, you could easily poll their order book on a timer and assume that everyone else is slower.

BitcoinMarkets,3dsz9z,trem0lo,7,Sun Jul 19 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Sell pressure (and volume in general, both up and down) drying up is one attribute to look for toward the end of reaccumulation as supply gets absorbed. Seeing a nice W bottom on the 6h as a result."
BitcoinMarkets,3dsz9z,biglambda,3,Sun Jul 19 21:21:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for that. We are riding hard on the upper bound downward trendline currently. Do you think another move to the 272-266 range is possible?

BitcoinMarkets,3dsz9z,packetinspector,4,Sun Jul 19 22:15:27 2015 UTC,"I agree that we're not going much further down, however I think it's healthy for us to sit $20 to $40 below the $300 price level for a while before making the final break-out. The recent rise up from $220, while less steep than the previous two, was still coming from too low a platform to convincingly break through what appears to have become a significant psychological price point.  I'm actually really happy with this 6+ months of the price being between $200 and $300. I think it's been very healthy and I'm not really interested in seeing the price move past $300 until it's sustainable. I'd be happy for it to sit in the high $200s for another couple of months.

BitcoinMarkets,3dnpmn,biglambda,3,Sat Jul 18 00:15:36 2015 UTC,Sounds exactly like OKCoin futures full screen -- not sure why anyone would consider Stamp's or Coinbase's UI the industry standard to move toward as they are both quite rudimentary -- also sounds like you are about to pitch consulting services lol -- Coinbase order book depth visualization is not ideal in the horizontal format -- it needs to move to a more BW/CW format -- props to /u/lowstrife getting Athur from CW to add the depth visualization in the margin and ability to collapse the larger one for more quick reference toggling   There is a lot to be desired with UI/UX but really the time&sales with the book appropriately color coded is everything that OKC full screen is and includes a less ultiized chart feature -- which makes sense when TV has an enormous library of tools and indicators for maximum charting (minus order book but that is coming as well)
BitcoinMarkets,3dnpmn,BTCVIX,2,Sat Jul 18 01:58:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, agreed. Coinbase and Stamp have their own problems. Cryptowatch has the best layout. But this is a conversation about Kraken."

If the interface for Kraken was more like Bitstamp or Coinbase, I would trade there more. I find it fairly confusing as it is.   So.... what I am saying is you almost perfectly described OKC futures full screen with your follow up description    Chart, orderbook, spread, open orders, fills, all on the same page, updating in realtime. Bid, ask table displayed vertically with spread in the center. Dark background.    http://i.imgur.com/q9XnTAO.png  So I would probably advise Kraken to take a look at that full screen model as something to work toward -- seems to be closer to what you want at least"
BitcoinMarkets,3dnpmn,BTCVIX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:20:57 2015 UTC,I see. Lets add OKC futures to that list. It's not as slick though ;)

For order entry I like a separate page all together, very clean with order typing drop down. Then for for charting I am going have that on it is own tab or multiple monitors with 4 panel BW hypron of the major spot markets and a drill down on TV of OKC futs with my custom and proprietary indicator scripts"
BitcoinMarkets,3dnpmn,BTCVIX,2,Sat Jul 18 02:32:52 2015 UTC,"Fuck you, we do the same thing. High tf charts on TV, then small live charts on a 2x2 BW and I watch futures on a 2x1 CW panel on yet another monitor. One tab for btc futures, another for Ltc futures. Tradingview has charts down cold so they get all the high time frame and social media. BW and CW have charting down and the best of any website ever. Then just the ok futures 'trade' page for order entry. I don't need a chart for orders, I don't need the full screen, I already have those things to my left so the cleanest and most efficient order entry is necessary.   This is why I think exchanges should have multiple options. Okcoin has two trade screens, a larger and more complex 'charts'  page with a BW style chart and big order books and then their full screen platform for different types of people who like different things. Not everyone trades the same way.   It really sucks okcoin has taken a reputation beating, they have an amazing ui /ux as you say. I'd be totally happy using it in the long run. I only have one or two minor quips, but more than that it's perfect. The problems come from the technical side and keeping uptime at as many 9's as possible. Glitches are becoming more and more common. But, like you, I think we stay at okc and are inherit shills because fuck, nowhere else is nearly as good so it's worth the risk."

Having the orderbook depth (both, visually and the numbers) on first page where you buy/sell is essential. Having to switch pages is crap. Clicking on an order should fill in the numbers in the trading tab. Clicking on an order down in the orderbook should then fill in the sum. An 1-100% okcoin-like bar to quickly do an all-in order would be nice, too. Best thing would be a simple buy/sell bot (start buying/selling x to x random amounts at x to x price, multiple orders possible)."

Then combine that with their indicator alerts and you essentially can auto-trade if you do desire with alert being a trade trigger/place trade -- and Trading View has a massive user driven custom indicator section so that would be very exciting"

This is the 3rd time this has happened I believe, and this is the 3rd time in recent weeks that I've contacted support and not received a response.    Edit again: 2 days later I get a response to my ticket:    Apologies for the delayed answer. We had a minor issue but it has been resolved.   Good eh?"

BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,DogeBets,7,Fri Jul 17 08:43:32 2015 UTC,Yup there's a 55% socialized loss.  Top holder for LTC contracts actually got margin called from the 55% haircut. He had 80k quarterly contracts margin called at 2.59 which is hilarious. To get margin called with a 55% socialized loss he must've been more than 50x long on his maintenance margin. (You get margin called if you're 100x)  I also made a post to explain how much there was in clawbacks. https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3dl65o/daily_discussion_friday_july_17_2015/ct6csfz
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,Jiecut,2,Fri Jul 17 09:00:28 2015 UTC,"What's weird is the top holder still has 83,020 contracts. So did the person get margin called and buy back in by buying that wall."

BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,ecafyelims,5,Fri Jul 17 11:44:35 2015 UTC,"Tell me if you need a further explanation.  Losses are socialized because without a risk system in place, Okcoin would not be able to offer 20x or 10x leverage with 1% maintenance margin. And you can't get something close to this without a socialized system.  Also there's the fundamental problem that this is unlike spot trading. You don't hold collateral when you trade. You're just holding contracts and people are only required to put up 5% or 10% initial margin.  If there was only two traders who made a contract on 20x. If you made 200% profit there would be a 50% socialized loss, if you made 300% profit there would be a 67% socialized loss. But because of liquidity it ended up being much better. Also people were able to make more than 200% profit before the socialized loss."
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,Jiecut,0,Fri Jul 17 14:33:42 2015 UTC,Well said.
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,flibbrMarketplace,6,Fri Jul 17 17:56:52 2015 UTC,"I'm Roger Ver, long-time Bitcoin advocate and investor. Today, I'm at the OKCasino world headquarters in Beijing, China. I had a nice chat with OKCasino CEO, Star Xu, about their current situation. He showed me futures settlements, as well as trade accounts from heavily leveraged margin gamblers. I'm sure that all the current socialised loss problems at OKCasino are being caused by the traditional gambling system, not because of a lack of liquidity at OKCasino. The traditional gambling partners that OKCasino needs to work with are well able to keep up with the demands of the growing interest in cryptocurrency gambling. The dozens of people that make up the OKCasino team are hard at work establishing more ways for you to lose your cryptocurrency, and eventually it will make dealing with OKCasino easier for all their customers to gamble away their funds. For now, I hope that everyone will continue depositing Bitcoin and Litecoin to OKCasino so Star Xu can buy a bigger house."

BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,SerenityTrading,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:31:52 2015 UTC,Yes it shows that it's important to have something in the insurance fund.
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,Jiecut,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:43:48 2015 UTC,That means you made over 100 LTC of profit too.
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,Jiecut,4,Fri Jul 17 14:44:31 2015 UTC,Actually I was doing arbitrage and with this clawback I lost all my profits plus some. I'm stuck with the losses accrued from holding LTC in the main account while I got assraped with this clawback on futures cause that's where my gains were.  Not doing that again. Also I wonder how miners and hedgers feel about this rapage. After this debacle using okcoin futures for hedging is useless.
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,Techynot,3,Fri Jul 17 16:29:49 2015 UTC,Ahh that sucks. But the bulk of margin calls were from the beginning of the week. You should have taken that into account when you were doing arbitrage. It was clear there was going to be a sizeable clawback.
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,Jiecut,3,Fri Jul 17 16:32:35 2015 UTC,I expected 10-20% not 50%. But yes the draining of the insurance fund last week should've be been a red flag.  I traded during the last 3 days after the whole shitfest ended. I don't see how its just that I should pay for losses when I wasn't even short when the largest margin calls transpired.  If you're going to socialise losses at least do it between the longs/shorts at the time of the margin calls.  The whole system is absurd.

BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,Devam13,2,Fri Jul 17 10:54:26 2015 UTC,"When someone went 10x or 20x long and they couldn't close before their account goes into negative balance since price went down way too fast.  But there isn't negative balance in OKCoin like there is for some Forex brokers. You can actually lose more money than you deposit in with Forex brokers since they chase you for the negative balance you owe.   But in Bitcoin, they don't do this and the losses that the person who has the negative balance just gets paid by everyone who was profitable that week. So if you were profitable that week, you have to also pay for the negative balance of other users in the system."
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,Devam13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:55:24 2015 UTC,Oh. Thanks. That makes sense. But couldn't this be prevented if it automatically closes the position if they lose like 90% or 80% of their deposits?
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,STRML,3,Fri Jul 17 14:13:20 2015 UTC,"If it were a bucket shop model, the system could automatically close the position against the house and there wouldn't be an issue. The problem is fundamentally about liquidity - when the market is really rocketing in one direction or another, positions will need to be auto-closed and there will need to be a user willing to take the other side of the position at that price. That isn't always the case and that slippage causes negative account balance, aka bankruptcy.  It's an unfortunate reality of a system where traders enjoy limited downside and unlimited upside. That money has to come from somewhere. Since it's impossible to go after a user for their negative account balance (they will simply close the account / disappear), the money has to come from the users who made profit."

BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,STRML,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:46:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's how it usually works. The total loss for a contract is summed up at settlement and all profit is shaved by that amount. It's just simple math: % loss = Total Trader Profit / System Loss.   Since this happens at settlement, realized profit needs to stay in limbo until then so it can be given a haircut."
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,ChemicalRain,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:25:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, and if I remove coins after making profit I will have a negative balance after the haircut and will be removed from my next deposit?"
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,STRML,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:40:59 2015 UTC,"It's usually impossible to withdraw pending profits or re-invest them in another position, which would make it impossible to have a negative balance.  In general, exchanges prevent you from ever having a negative balance because Bitcoin is anonymous. A user could ""run away"" from a negative balance easily. The exchange has no way to reliably find a user in order to demand money owed, and it's unclear that it would be possible to do so via legal means anyway."
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,Jiecut,2,Mon Jul 20 00:14:05 2015 UTC,"Yes except under the situation where either price crashes too fast for that to work or OKCoin gets DDoSed and nobody can open or close new positions until the site is back up, so everyone's just stuck with that they have."
BitcoinMarkets,3dlt1o,Greencheckmark,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:16:39 2015 UTC,The problem is if there is more than a 1% move then they'll be unable  close it. And with LTC volatility we have see much more than 1% moves.

BitcoinMarkets,3dgtxn,kayagoban,2,Thu Jul 16 21:04:15 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. The 5 year cagr is like 200% or something so as long as the market is net long (which  is tautological) then there are more winners.   Yes, every trade has a winner and a loser, but by managing margins, stops, and risk exposure all markets are mutually profitable. A trader may have just sold at $310 because they want to take their gains. Others may take a ""loss"" on the other side of that trade because they are on a different trading timeline; a buyback $310 could keep ripping up, or you can just hold it for the long term. People would not move into a position to take a loss. It may be a calculated loss, but that was what they wanted.   Bitcoin leaves ample room for net profit because it has such a strong growth rate, meaning that margin (and therefore net profit in the market) is massive."

BitcoinMarkets,3dgtxn,graduallywinning,7,Thu Jul 16 18:53:59 2015 UTC,"So, let me get this straight... A European country almost had a collapse, and the price of Bitcoin went up, and then it received a bailout to delay the inevitable... And bitcoin's price went down?   Sooner or later we're going to have another financial collapse, what is Bitcoin going to do then? For the last month we've seen article after article mentioning bitcoin as an interesting go-to resource for anyone who lives in a country going down the shitter. In response the google searches went up in that country and the price rose. I predict that when the next recession happens (we're due in the next 3 years, apparently, and looking at europe it doesn't look like we're going to have to wait much longer) all we'll need is for a noticeable increase in bitcoin for people to notice, the media to publish one headline showing bitcoin being a safe-haven and we'll have a new ATH.   However for now I guess it's 50% retracement time; back down to $255 or so, and possibly a continuation of the bear rainbow in the meantime."

I'm long with a tight stop. If this goes up, then we'll most likely see one of the following 1. double top formation; 2. run up to 345; 3. 400. If 280 breaks, then drop to ~260 is inevitable."

I get messages from people who criticize me simply for having a flair of ""bearish"" and maintaining it through these rises (which aren't ""bubbles"".)  Everyone around here spends too much time on short-term technical trends and ignores the fundamentals.  These rises are not going to hold until there is more adoption by large corporations, and the 1MB transaction limit is resolved.  The transaction limit problem holds bitcoin back, in this sort of game-like state it's been in for years.  Rather than bitcoin being ready to take over the world, people are buying up litecoins and investing in other systems like Ripple in case the problem never is solved.  Altcoins should be a sidenote by now, but they will continue to remain relevant and make cryptocurrency a circus-like speculation atmosphere until bitcoin is much more capable than these other systems."
BitcoinMarkets,3dgtxn,ProHashing,3,Thu Jul 16 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"Rather than bitcoin being ready to take over the world, people are buying up litecoins    you can't be for real... repeating it over and over again doesn't make it true   The transaction limit problem holds bitcoin back   I'd really want the 1MB to be changed, and I'm glad the plans get more and more concrete. But I don't believe for 1 second that BTC is where it is price-vise because of the block size limit. If the block size debate would have any influence on the price, the stress test would have taken us sub-200.  In order to even know of the block size limit and what it means, you have to be so far into bitcoin already that you also know that it's not something to be afraid of. What holds bitcoin back are shady exchanges and old prejudices, unclear legal standing and technophobia. Ask anybody outside this small bitcoin world what they think of bitcoin, and 19 out of 20 answers will be   -BitWhat?  -isn't that Internet Drug Money?  -didn't the CEO commit suicide?  -didn't that close down after somebody stole $800 Million from some Mountain?  -BitWhat?  A bullmarket has to be established with ""old money"" before ""new money"" takes notice. Since the crash in the beginning of January, we are up over $100 from the bottom. Babysteps. Battered Bull Syndrome, not technical limitations, is what keeps a lid on the price."
BitcoinMarkets,3dgtxn,SpunkShrapnel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:12:40 2015 UTC,"Markets are based on promise.  When you buy a stock, among other reasons, you buy because you believe a company is going to overcome obstacles and pay dividends in the future, not today.  During the last bubbles, bitcoin was promising to investors because the future looked bright.  The number of users was increasing exponentially, the number of large retailers accepting bitcoin was increasing significantly, and public attention was rising.  Now, the future doesn't look so bright.  While the 1MB transaction limit is not a problem right now, the future is hindered by it.  While bitcoin has more users than it did two years ago, the technical problems were not on the immediate horizon then.  Now they are.  It won't be until bitcoin's promise returns, which will probably occur when it looks as if the limit is going to be resolved rather than when it is actually resolved, that prices rise."

Isn't that already on the horizon thou? Or are you attributing the rise from ~$250 to where we are now to the advanced talks about the block size limit?  Ah, well. Maybe you are right and this is what holds us back at the moment. I kinda contradict myself when I say ""new money"" doesn't know about the block size and after that I say ""new money"" doesn't come in before ""old money"" ends the bear market. And ""old money"" certainly knows about the block size limit and its implied problems.

BitcoinMarkets,3dgtxn,holyoak,2,Thu Jul 16 17:14:26 2015 UTC,"I'm attributing the price rises and falls within this range to being noise.  I think that the price continues to fall because the block size debate is going nowhere.  The smart people realized long ago that nobody is ever going to come to a ""consensus"" about the problem because there are too many people at the table.  The true problem all comes down to there being nobody who is willing to step up and be a leader.  Everyone is all talk.  They submit pull requests and wait for 100% ACKs, and they propose BIPs and other solutions, but nobody has actually said ""here's what I think we should do, and here is the code to do it, and if you're with me, install it.""  That's the only way that the issue is going to be resolved.  I think that the price will continue to hang around until someone from the outside steps in and makes a fork and releases that code."

BitcoinMarkets,3dgtxn,johnmcnamee,3,Thu Jul 16 07:31:41 2015 UTC,"True, but I think that the agressive shorting with leverage might break the bubble illusion a bit sooner, people get scared and pull out when a largeish counter move is made because they think that the top is in.

BitcoinMarkets,3dgtxn,michelmx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:13:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you do have a point.  But I still think there was probably some fundamental(s) which helped cause the run-up.  Maybe the Shanghai stock market sell-off?  I also do understand that any unprepared Greeks themselves have access to govt fiat to buy bitcoin at the moment.  But, in the end, I think that with so much news coverage on mismanagement of the Euro, and bank closings in Greece, this may have made some people less trusting of leaving their money in the bank.   It just reminds people that banks are fallible.  I'm kinda paranoid myself - I always breathe a sigh of relief when the ATM hums and spits out all my cash.  And during weeks like this, with the mess in Europe, I go to the ATM a few extra times - just to have some cash on hand, in case there's some cascading glitch in the ATMs around the world.  I thought the Greek situation was resolved over the weekend. Now I know that it ain't over - particularly now that even the IMF has chimed in and said that Schauble's austerity package wasn't done right, because it lacks a crucial ingredient: outright forgiving of unpayable debts.  Plus there were a lot of posts about the complexity of setting up payments systems, which I was reading on nakedcapitalism.com. It kinda made me breathe a sigh of relief: all we have to do is fork some code on github and we're cool. Legacy payment systems - wow are they creaky and inefficient!  http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2015/07/the-card-system-demystified-and-implications-for-a-grexit.html  What a convoluted mess!

BitcoinMarkets,3dgtxn,BeYourOwnBank,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:27:35 2015 UTC,you are right no reason at all. bitcon is just a decentralized currency immune to capital controls.  This sub is a bit over populated by TA fundamentalists. There is more in life then graphs you know.  markets are related to the real world. TA is good to identify support and resistance but ultimately it is real world events that will drive the price up or down.  Just look at the chart in combination with greek news. Can it get more obvious?
BitcoinMarkets,3dgtxn,OttawaLitecoins,3,Fri Jul 17 01:39:50 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe this was just a typical run-up that overshot and is now in the process of correcting.  If you zoom out to 4 hours it could be interpreted that way: started at 219 USD, overshot up to 316 USD, now slumping back down 280 and possibly still slumping further.   If it plateaus again somewhere around the middle between 219 and 316 for the next few days, then we could interpret it as a decent ratchet or notch up.  Long-term, I'm bullish. As more cracks appear in more centralized debt-backed mismanaged state-based currencies, I think we're just gonna keep seeing more of these notch-ups (ie a big overshoot followed by a medium slump-down to a new plateau somewhere in the middle: net-net a notch-up).  Sorry I don't know how to use technical terms like cup-and-handle and head-and-shoulders. I tend to think those are all noise (although I do acknowledge it can be self-fulfilling noise, if it has enough believers).  Long-term, bitcoin is going up due to fundamentals - because so many government fiats are going down - and because gold and silver can be manipulated by naked-shorting ETF paper. Of course, vermin like JPM alumna Blythe Masters will try to apply the same hocus-pocus to bitcoin - but we can stop them, if enough of us end up demanding real-time crypto-verification of reserves.  The overriding long-range fundamental for bitcoin is up, and it's been fascinating to finally have this kind of indicator now like we've had for the past week: an asset that truly reacts (and sometimes overreacts!) to the political and financial hanky-panky our leaders   Most of us are here because we understand, at some level, that bitcoin's long-term fundamentals are ""up"" - (even if some of you technical trader types know how to skim extra money off the manics and the panics - I don't, I'm just a humble hodler).  Caveat: that blocksize debate could hobble us. Big money can smell a mismanaged project riven by schisms, and will prudently stay away.   However, I'm fairly confident that some anti-fragile remedy will probably be found: maybe (as ProHashing says elsewhere ITT) someone just takes a stand, ups the blocksize limit (modestly, to minimize disruption - and hopefully with more flexible code, to avoid the need for more hardforks down the road), and says Who's with me?"

If that user was not who he said he was, the real user could have simply reactivated their account with a simple email or phone call. Big fucking deal.  As far as their prices, yea, that's not a big issue when you consider they are literally the fastest way to buy bitcoin. There's a cost associated with convenience.  Also, I've never heard of anyone who had to pay $10 for a membership fee, it's just listed in their terms and conditions to cement their standing as a private membership group in the eyes of regulators.  Seems like you have an axe to grind with little to no regard for the actual truth. Oh well."

This is end of the trading day in Asia.. they seem to put on or take off positions.  Weekly - If we're going to get a dump the most consistent time is 20-30 minutes after okcoin expiration.

BitcoinMarkets,3dihz6,ROFLQuad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:52:46 2015 UTC,"This is kind of like asking ""What time of day in general do I get the best milk price?"".  The price doesn't follow our clocks. Asians trade during the North American night. And vice versa. Are you shopping on their market or ours?  You'd be better off telling yourself ""I'm going to buy $50 a day of BTC, every day, at 4pm"". Some days the price will be lower than others. But overall I don't think you're going to gain anything by buying BTC on Tuesdays at 1am weekly over the year, compared to Friday's at 5pm."
BitcoinMarkets,3dihz6,ROFLQuad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:26:11 2015 UTC,"I don't follow.  Of course people around the world trade at different times, but that doesn't mean there aren't times that tend to have lower prices.  For example if ACH transfers clear in America around noon on most exchanges, and that happens to be when Chinese traders close their positions, it could create consistent local depressions in price even though the times in China and America do not line up.  I don't think you can say time of day has no effect on price unless you've crunched the data.   This is kind of like asking ""What time of day in general do I get the best milk price?"".   And this might be a relevant question if by ""milk price"" you mean ""on the commodities market"".  Consumer prices are way stickier obviously, due to the lag it takes to update them in store to responses in aggregate trends."
BitcoinMarkets,3dihz6,Qewbicle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:27:46 2015 UTC,"Time of day has no effect on BTC. I can say this with complete certainty, yes.   Transfers clear. . . chinese traders close their positions. . . I think you're missing something here (I don't mean that rudely either). This isn't NASDAQ, there are no closing times. There is no closing your position until you feel like closing it. You can buy BTC at any hour of the day. Every day of the week. No holidays. No weekends. No Bank can stop you. There is no ""local"" to the price of BTC, it's a global currency, moving at all hours of every day. There would be instant arbitrage with a digital currency like BTC if there was any fluctuation like that. And there is some actually on LocalBitcoins.com (I do a little myself actually but only because I'm the physical barrier to folks too nervous to just buy BTC online themselves so my service has a price)  BTC news used to come out at all different times of the day and the price swings were wild in 2013! You'd wake up and the price jumped $20 a coin. You'd be at your office and the price dropped $50. You'd go to sleep and have no idea what you were waking up to.  You may be able to empirically determine the general hour across the last year a particular market had it's lowest prices for that day. . . But I don't think you're going to see a trend or even a difference big enough to justify waiting to buy BTC until that hour every day.  Did you buy any BTC last month? Who cares what time of day, just did you buy any? Because no matter what time you bought at, it's gone up since then. Was it $3 cheaper June 2nd at 3am compared to June 16th at 8pm? Who cares, if you waited until June 16th you'd have already missed out :)   Otherwise, good luck! I've been buying BTC for 3 years and if there's anything I've learned it's that everything you've learned about markets and financial trends. . . BTC just doesn't obey :)"
BitcoinMarkets,3dihz6,zoinks10,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:46:09 2015 UTC,"This is what you're looking for http://cointracking.info/bitcoin_analysis.php     Keep in mind that this changes regularly. Turn off euro all time/last month and turn on usd and toggle between all time and last month. Keep in mind that this month is different than last month.    An increase one day at midnight and a decrease the next day at midnight will negate each other and really wont change the times/days until one happens more than another.    Expect a decrease tonight from 7pm pst to 12:30 pst to $274-$260. This is pure speculation. I think we will likely see this as the next target before a rally above $300.    This is just for fun, and it can change dramatically from one minute to the next and my speculation above is not based on this, but I like how it points to the range that I figured earlier. http://www.btcpredictions.com/    Edit: Much added as afterthought after posting link."

A powerful concept someone once taught me - think of the market as constantly giving signals, signals which are ""continuation"" or ""change"". These signals exist for each timeframe. So far, on the timeframes I ""trade"" (in quotes because I'm just an armchair trader, in reality I just hold and accumulate), I haven't seen any ""change"" signals from the current steepening up trend. If we are rejected strongly again at 300 I could consider it a ""change"" signal, because it would mean the current steepening up trend was no longer steepening (and perhaps toppling over)."

I trust OKC to crash the price again, because people continue to endorse them with their business, which leads to them being a market leader, which leads to more participation.

BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,pdtmeiwn,2,Wed Jul 15 14:52:42 2015 UTC,And how far does the price have to fall to get forced liquidated if you have only 0.01 BTC in reserve?
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,Greencheckmark,3,Wed Jul 15 16:51:57 2015 UTC,"If I shorted 0.01 BTC right now at 1,813.3 CNY I would get margin called and lose it at 1,888.9 CNY."
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,pdtmeiwn,2,Wed Jul 15 16:54:19 2015 UTC,"Let's say you bought BTCUSD futures right now at 292.4 at 20x margin with $10,000.    At what price would I get margin called?  Liquidated?  BTW, thanks very much for answering my questions."
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,Greencheckmark,2,Wed Jul 15 17:05:25 2015 UTC,"You go all in 20x long with $10,000 at 1,809.5 CNY  You'll get margin called and lose it all at 1,740.0 CNY"
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,renegadellama,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:15:51 2015 UTC,"Of course you can set a stop order to prevent being margin called, right?"
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,Greencheckmark,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was added in October of last year."
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,Jiecut,2,Wed Jul 15 17:39:34 2015 UTC,This is the answer you're looking for.  The maintenance margin is 1% for both 20x and 10x.  So -90% on 10x and -80% on 20x.
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,pdtmeiwn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:42:22 2015 UTC,"Can you give an example with real numbers?  I have some money at OKCoin.  I buy a position using $10,000 and go long 20x.  How far does the position have to drop before being called?  $100,00 * 20 = $200,000 in control  $200,000 has to fall to what number to before being margin called?  Surely before it becomes $190,000, right?"
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,Jiecut,2,Wed Jul 15 23:18:16 2015 UTC,"One thing to note is that you have to use BTC as collateral for futures.  You get force liquidated when the 200,000 is worth 192,000. They do a limit order for the bankruptcy price (When it's worth 190,000)."
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,pdtmeiwn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:35:32 2015 UTC,Ok. Now is making sense. And how much collateral is required in the above scenario?
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,Jiecut,2,Thu Jul 16 01:00:05 2015 UTC,So initial collateral is 5%. $10k for 200k.  Maintenance margin is 1%. So you need at least 2k for your position. It works a bit differently because everythings in flux but that's the basic concept.  So you'd need 10k collateral. And your collateral balance needs to stay above 2k.
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,renegadellama,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:05:56 2015 UTC,"How does leverage differ from margin trading? My understanding of margin is that you borrow 3x what you have for interest, right?"
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,pitchbend,4,Thu Jul 16 01:31:31 2015 UTC,"It's the same. Bitfinex gives you 3x and Okcoin gives you 20x.  Which means that on Okcoin you can borrow 20 times the money of your collateral unlike bitfinex where you can borrow ""only"" 3 times your collateral (money in your account)"
BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,Jiecut,2,Thu Jul 16 01:34:36 2015 UTC,Also maintenance margin on finex is 13% and maintenance margin on okcoin is 1%. That's a big difference.  You don't get leftovers of that 1% back if you get force liquidated but you wouldn't be getting anywhere close to 1% on a traditional platform.  Bitmex may also be implementing 5%/1% but it might actually be more dangerous than okcoin. I think okcoin will have tighter spreads and more liquidity than bitmex.

It will take some serious buying power to get back to that level let alone go past it and make new highs.   Also that drop from 305 to 280 was very quick and violent. I have a feeling a lot of people got left out and still haven't taken profits for their longs from earlier and are waiting for the price to go above 300 to get out. Just adds to the selling pressure.

BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,RockyLeal,3,Wed Jul 15 23:03:13 2015 UTC,"Please, people, stop correlating everything that happens in Greece to the price of BTC. The Greek situation has already played most of the role it was going to play in terms of influencing the price, by being a catalist of the resolution of inbalances in the market. The price was too low, and about to rally, and Greece default and referendum tipped the tide. Likewise, the price was too high and was up for a correction anytime, and Greek deal determined when. The next movements are not a reflection on whether the news in Greece are 'bad' or 'good', and the next thing that catalises the price to move will most likely come from China, Wall Street, or Italy, not Greece anymoree."

That's sort of the flaw when people talk about Bitcoin and Greece, they don't have money with which to acquire money, so unless they want to sell everything they have to people outside the country, it's not really useful.

BitcoinMarkets,3dcc9c,-xyz,-3,Wed Jul 15 08:23:19 2015 UTC,"Moving on up! We're following a patten from September 2013 pretty well. Lets look at the short term, and zoom into a web of color: Here we see a climb within the week to ~$360. Alternatively, shifted/matching it slightly lower, to ~$350. Unfortunately, Bitfinex has been more conservative than the Chinese exchanges, so $350 seems more likely.  If followed completely, it would mean $3000 in mid to late October. The trendlines predicting support/resistance match up amazingly well. It's shocking how BTC works like this. Here is the zoomed out view.  Anyway, notice the Ws formed/forming. There's two, and bullish. Here's the BIG Big W though. Bouncing around to form a handle, between support and resistance, would make sense, as it's 'finding its center'.  Later, beware margin calls. The spike down that happened before the bubble in 2013, overlayed, just so happens to match up with the long term downward trendline (cyan) and a vital support line (dashed blue, ~$220). Take a look.  Note, 2-3 months was the time period /u/azop stated was needed before prices reached ATH/bubbled after peak stability (which we had not long ago).  ;)  There are many more lines that fit this that I haven't drawn, surprisingly. -edit- Regarding the timing, here's the volume mirrored around the point of lowest volume. It coincides nicely with the above model. Also, you can see it over the very long term increasing at a consistent angle--the inverse of consolidation. Expect the volume to grow, not actually be mirrored."

My favorite posters here are probably /u/trem0lo [1] and /u/lowstrife   Ayyyyy. Thanks mate.    I actually came and read your post, and what you said about picking a single trader or set of traders and understanding what works for them is critically important. I would have to attribute the majority of my knowledge of trading to /u/flibbrmarketplace and those in the google hangouts before Whaleclub was formed in early 2014. I learned patterns, macd turns, accumulation, support\resistance, trendlines, divergences, setups.... all from him and a few key others (Brian B aka CRInvestor being another big one).   I will also say it does not necessarily take years. I did it in months. So it's possible. The sad part about trading is for every winner there is a looser and in my time I have seen SO many people get destroyed by improper ""x"" or just bad luck. It's unfortunate because you think ""that could be me"" next time around and personally it just motivates me to stay ontop of my game. I just found something that works and is successful for me, so I'm going to keep at it until it stops working."
BitcoinMarkets,3daxez,lowstrife,2,Wed Jul 15 00:33:32 2015 UTC,"picking a single trader or set of traders and understanding what works for them is critically important   I think that was the cause of so much hate towards me in the past.  Because I wouldn't actually post in-depth detailed methods about why my trades were what they were.  I would say 'hey market looks primed for a drop, check out the 4hr on okcoin"" or ""triple top forming, time to hibernate"".  I have since started explaining the charts and what I am looking at (eg bull pennant, providing links to identifying common trends, price bands, etc) and magically the downvotes have changed to upvotes.  The only thing is my secret weapon (OP touched on a similar method for stocks using scanners) which I keep closely guarded as it has seriously raised my accuracy to about 80-85% and TBH I don't believe anyone (outside of institutional money) is doing what I am doing in the crypto scene.  Anyway that was a tangent.  I totally agree that you can pick it up in months, however give yourself a year before you begin to win larger trades.  A year ago today I was trading only 5BTC, patience and accepting my strategy for $5-$20 profits here and there (1% daily gain was my motto) was all I needed.  It manifested in winning the LTC lottery by perfectly calling the drop and the oscillation that followed.  DISCLAIMER: I have traded stocks on and off for 15 years"
BitcoinMarkets,3daxez,lowstrife,3,Wed Jul 15 02:25:56 2015 UTC,"Scanners for indicators? It's to my opinion that for a large part indicators are mostly useless for a few exceptions; I mean they can be used properly but if a market starts trending you can throw them mostly out the window. I just enjoy being able to string trades together quickly when there is high volatility, I'm terrible at waiting for them to come when things are moving slower. I suppose my advantage is I am able to process ""xyz"" about the market faster than most people during high volatility periods and make better calls especially when people are FOMOing orders everywhere.   I gave up explaining why most of the time and I don't fish for upvotes; but I do get what you mean when you ""feel"" the market is going to do something. For any number of reasons, there are tons of setups that I see form a certain outcome with a reasonable high percentage of the time.  How often do your trade setups\scanners run? Is it sometimes clusters very close together and periods where you get nothing or is it fairly spread out evenly? And IIRC institutional money loves support\resistance because you need to scale in\out big positions.... That + fibs are my favorite. I know we are in a ""bottoming"" area so I start looking for counter-move entries and bottoms, etc."
BitcoinMarkets,3daxez,lowstrife,2,Wed Jul 15 03:07:10 2015 UTC,"I don't fish for upvotes, but god dammit it is really shitty when you enter a discussion, start a thread that goes 6-7 levels deep but you end up with -20 votes because of haters.  Then I can't reply for months at a time because my karma is too low.    It is great for lower timescales. Eg 2hrs and less.  I do find it does not ""predict"" when volume is low.  Like right now with LTC.  I will say it is fairly consistent and still provides useful information to backup technical indicators on 4+hr charts.  I typically do long term trades no less than 4 hours and so technical indicators point me in the direction while my setup keeps those indicators honest.  Basically, I have codified that 'feeling' of the market.  My scanners are always running :)  Seriously can't talk too much about it, I was hired by someone on reddit to create it almost a year and half ago before the person disappeared without paying me.  Since I had a majority of the system in place, I just finished it and started enhancing it.  It does not replace technical indicators but rather compliments it.  Helping you find the counter-move entries and bottoms (EDIT: that was a 9600 LTC short from 8.01 to 5.45).

Note that the dump happened during a ""volatility expansion"" of the channel: http://i.imgur.com/EAGJvXF.png  Compare this to last time, when the post-297 dump happened after price failed to traverse the channel (as well as reach 300). This is a clear example of supply pressure absorbing demand pressure until the balance flipped to the sell side. Notice now it sort of ""tips over"": http://i.imgur.com/dy3LWpw.png Often this chain of events is also what creates H&S patterns.  We haven't cleared the 300-320 level yet, but for me, signs point to much more strength this time than last. The selloff was absorbed by strong buying (wide spread, high volume sell bar followed by small spread, high volume buy bar). http://i.imgur.com/zqooxlf.png There could be more selling to come yet, but I remain highly bullish until 280 is breached or we see an obvious failure to traverse the channel (or double top, whatever you want to call it) and additional weakness.

BitcoinMarkets,3d7p3f,jeanduluoz,3,Tue Jul 14 04:32:15 2015 UTC,Now creeping below that would be bearish? I'm undecided. On the 6h/12h also looks like a weak flag so maybe a up movement follows. Oscillators are recharged too.
BitcoinMarkets,3d7p3f,avocadosandham,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:33:47 2015 UTC,It has bounced nicely from yesterday's low. Bullish signal in place today. We should get back to 310 levels today or tomorrow.

BitcoinMarkets,3d7p3f,coldmug,2,Tue Jul 14 10:00:03 2015 UTC,Check their FAQs. Usually it takes exchanges a few days.
BitcoinMarkets,3d7p3f,IronicVisa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:55:47 2015 UTC,"They say up to 7 days, which is intentionally vague. I know SEPA is pretty much one business day, but not sure whether they sit on it before crediting the account."
BitcoinMarkets,3d7p3f,avocadosandham,3,Tue Jul 14 11:06:29 2015 UTC,"It might be they need to verify transfers. It might also just be a requirement from their bank, considering they're a bitcoin business."
BitcoinMarkets,3d7p3f,thieflar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:20:46 2015 UTC,BTCe doesn't have bank accounts in its name which is likely the cause for the delay. It's routed through other money services business accounts.

I can't wait!""   I think this 300 cup and handle is the final signal the a long term bull trend, dare I say bubble, is real.  I think if this cup makes a nice handle and breaks out strong we will see parabolic rise from there.  Hopefully there are a few stalls on the way.  My feeling is the more stalls on the way up the bigger the bubble.   Got the name back in college and yes it is a take on Odb (RIP duh duh duh).  It works well for a internet handle."
BitcoinMarkets,3d7p3f,michelmx,14,Tue Jul 14 18:19:29 2015 UTC,"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33517252  TLDR is in first four lines:   Four pieces of legislation must be passed by the end of Wednesday including pension and VAT reforms.  But Defence Minister Panos Kammenos, a junior coalition partner, has already said he will not support the measures.  If the deal fails, Greece's banks face collapse and the country could then be forced to leave the euro.  The bailout is conditional on Greece passing all the agreed reforms - including raising tax revenue and liberalising the labour market - in parliament by Wednesday."

BitcoinMarkets,3d7p3f,michelmx,9,Tue Jul 14 06:30:53 2015 UTC,"ha, that is one of the few parts that didn't get many cuts.

And you only have to go back to 1967 to find the last time tanks rolled through the streets of Athens.   The coup leaders placed tanks in strategic positions in Athens, effectively gaining complete control of the city. At the same time, a large number of small mobile units were dispatched to arrest leading politicians, authority figures, and ordinary citizens suspected of left-wing sympathies, according to lists prepared in advance.

BitcoinMarkets,3d7p3f,zoinks10,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:20:35 2015 UTC,I doubt Greece's military spending is that large or that important to the EU other than as one additional area they can claw back some of the billions of euros that have been tipped into Greece.
BitcoinMarkets,3d7p3f,chairoverflow,3,Tue Jul 14 06:37:36 2015 UTC,no thats not correct. eu members have all signed agreements to spend 1% of gdp on defence and nato is part of that. the usa this year made an appeal for all eu countries to stick to the deal. attacking the defence budget is a red line in geopolitics.
BitcoinMarkets,3d7p3f,Nurotec,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:08:36 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, thanks for the clarification. I assumed Greece would have a relatively minor defence budget compared to the rest of NATO but if they have prior agreements then I guess they have to try and stick to them."
BitcoinMarkets,3d7p3f,avocadosandham,2,Tue Jul 14 08:12:29 2015 UTC,"Nope, Greece military spending was 2.0-2.5 % in last 10+ years. they could still slash it by 50% to remain at/over 1 % gdp"

Selling volume trails off dramatically as the market tests the $291-292 area again and again, teasing out selling that would otherwise slow a potential rally. The composite operator, if he's bullish, wants all that selling gone (preferably into his buy orders) to lower the cost basis of his long position and to increase the effectiveness of a rally. Once it's gone, he sends the market up."

""But mining is expensive"", so is gold mining, we spend billions mining for gold, then billions to store it in giant vaults, and you can't even buy anything with gold without first selling it for a currency.  The killer app for bitcoin is portable store of wealth, which can also be backed up, and stored in multiple locations.  You can't 'back up' your gold, or store all of it in multiple locations at the same time. This can be true even if ZERO merchants accept bitcoin, as is the case with gold.  Take a gold coin which may even be legal tender and it's unlikely the store will accept it in payment even for it's face value."

High sentiment is when everybody (yeah, I saw one or two) is shouting ""to the moon"" and we're breaking ATHs and people say things like ""I put my entire life savings into bitcoin last night"".  Of course that often ends up being followed by ""I am now homeless"". But it doesn't have to..."
BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,Jiecut,2,Mon Jul 13 20:28:05 2015 UTC,One thing I'd like to say is that the effect of leverage on the price is neutral. That's why it's hard to tell actual sentiment because there might be a lot of people who are bullish but they're just longing on margin.
BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,onthefrynge,2,Mon Jul 13 20:38:09 2015 UTC,There was a member here who wrote a bot to scour /r/bitcoin and this sub for positive and negative words and spit out a sentiment score. Anyone seen them lately?
BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,myownman,2,Mon Jul 13 20:42:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed!  I remember there was one for the trollbox, too.  If I remember correctly, it traded based upon words in the trollbox in real-time."
BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,Jiecut,2,Tue Jul 14 02:51:03 2015 UTC,It used thresholds of sentiments as entries/exits?
BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,TheRugAteMyShoe,2,Mon Jul 13 22:39:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, turn something like that that into a oscillator and use it in conjunction with something like RSI (on the price), and you might have a decent trading tool. I imagine the theory would be that if both sentiment and price RSI are pegged near the top, things might be about to change direction... and vice versa."
BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,bitofsense,-1,Tue Jul 14 01:59:25 2015 UTC,"we instead get many people pointing out that it's probably just a retracement    You must be new here. Each and every drop from $1000 to where we are now was just a temporary retracement or a small dip. $800 was a retracement from $900, then $600 was just a temporary dip from $700."
BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,TheRugAteMyShoe,10,Tue Jul 14 02:52:22 2015 UTC,"Not new at all. Despite the age of my user account, I've been frequenting this sub for about two years. Actually purchased some bitcoin in 2013 only a few weeks before it hit $1200 and then tanked hard, and the Gox drama drew me into these forums as a way of speculating over the cause (which we still don't bloody well know).  People were not happy, and it seemed one hack/DDOS/theft/ban/regulation after another either served as a cause - or justification - of further downwards sliding. Even when we went upwards, the prevailing sentiment was still negative. The only positive posts were more along the lines of hope or pleading - the kind of positive outlook you force yourself to have when things looks grim.  The kind of sentiment we're seeing now is something I haven't seen since the days of the November 2013 runup and the ""bubble watch"" that came after."
BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,imog,7,Tue Jul 14 19:38:19 2015 UTC,"We might be reading different posts. No one expected it to go to $160, and there have been many, many posts through the downtrend stating it won't go below $XXX."
BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,avocadosandham,5,Mon Jul 13 18:33:07 2015 UTC,I'm sure there were just as many posts of people saying it wont go above $XXX on the way up too.  The people that are right make their money from the people that are wrong.
BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,imog,2,Mon Jul 13 18:43:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but in my remembrance of history I recall more general disbelief and eupohoria about the rising price than all the bottom picking on the way down.

BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,packetinspector,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:42:11 2015 UTC,"I wrote a comment eight months ago that there was nothing magical about 266 and thus no reason why we couldn't drop below. In hindsight, it was probably no accident that we fell through it and then established a floor just below it (220). Way to inflict maximum pain on the market without actually tumbling to zero.  BTW, in the reply thread below my comment eight months ago there's someone tipping $150."

But there were also lots of ""I'm divesting"", ""I'm homeless now"", ""I just lost everything"" posts too. Although most of those were on /r/bitcoin.  The posts saying ""I think we have strong support at $xxx"" were also not usually particularly optimistic, though. They just as often continued on... ""but if we go below that, we'll crash hard"".  But you're right of course, it's very possible that we gave more attention or credence to different posts, depending on our own personal biases, and then later remembered only the things we really fixated on. Memory is a fragile thing."

BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,TheRugAteMyShoe,3,Mon Jul 13 23:46:06 2015 UTC,The market is largely determined by sentiment. Whether or not the sentiment seems unwarranted to an individual trader matters very little if the majority opinion becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,TheRugAteMyShoe,2,Mon Jul 13 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"Are you suggesting that the market is moved by aliens? People move the market, based mainly on their opinions.  The bubble watch didn't pan out as prophecy, perhaps because it was transparent numerology at best, and an intentional joke later in its life. On top of this, it wasn't very influential at the best of times. Very few people read this sub, and a smaller subset of those actually believed the bubble watch was legitimate TA.  Obviously, no sentiment indicator is perfect. But it's still worth looking for them when they become obvious... I am making the possibly incorrect assumption that the sentiment on this sub is representative of the entire bitcoin market. That may be a bad assumption. But if not, we're very likely to go back up ""soonish""."

BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,thieflar,5,Mon Jul 13 17:30:32 2015 UTC,"i agree 285-290 was a potential target from the current level if you follow correction principal.

BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,thieflar,5,Mon Jul 13 17:50:29 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'd prefer a healthy retracement like we just went through. Doesn't look like any serious panic-selling actually took place, and the bull-trend looks perfectly intact from where I'm sitting."

BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,Jiecut,2,Tue Jul 14 01:09:56 2015 UTC,I would like to develop a margin position.   From what I can see there is a small number of exchanges to choose from and a small range of margin multiples. It's also very expensive for medium or long term.   What is a good option for a medium term 1x-3x position?
BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,JaManSnowflake,4,Mon Jul 13 19:42:52 2015 UTC,"Bitfinex would be my #1. Coinsetter now has margin. Btc.sx (magnr trading) is also a good choice imo.  However, be very aware of counterparty risk, do your due diligence."

It's sort of like advertising too, to bootstrap their site. And it's not really expensive.  They are able to make a bit of money from fees too. One thing to note is that people on leverage pay more fees."
BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,nycgoat,3,Mon Jul 13 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"It is harder to prove the solvency of an exchange if they cannot withdraw fiat. In addition, there are counterparty risks to lending on an exchange. That is why the rates are so high in the first place.   Futures provide the best 'interest rate', but volatility and the recent incidents suggest that you should not trade with more than 1-2x. Premium for these products are much lower than margin interest rate."

BitcoinMarkets,3d4szu,stupidinternet,4,Mon Jul 13 21:52:28 2015 UTC,"Tough crowd. I suppose I could have written more explanation, but I'm on my tablet and the chart was pretty self explanatory. Anyway, for those not hip to my particular flavor of line drawing, the chart shows an accelerating slope of the right trend line (bullish) and price finding support at the 50% retracement of the most recent up move (262 to 316). The blue line (my highest probability scenario) shows consolidation in the 283-290 area and then a mini cup/handle as we bust through 316 and out of the long term flat channel we've been in for months.  Of course, this is trading, and nobody can predict the future, and everything is probabilities, so I drew some other potential outcomes as well using the less steep trendlines and the old 18 month exponential bear trend line as well.   If I had to assign probabilities I'd say it goes down like the blue line 50% of the time, and the rest of the time something else happens (possibly what I drew for orange, red, and yellow)."

This distributed ledger concept has been privatized, although the companies that are developing these systems use a consensus algorithm instead of proof of work. These systems are controllable, repeatable, reversible and accountable, all features the financial services industry needs, harps Preston Byrne  Digital Asset Holdings, which launched in March headed by former JPMorgan Chase exec Blythe Masters, uses cryptocurrency technology to enhance the settlement and recording of financial assets. Masters is seen as a force to be reckoned with in the financial services industry and isn't taking bets on either cryptocurrency infrastructure play.  ""So far, venture capitalists aren't funding [censorship resistant models],"" said Tim Swanson, an industry pundit that currently runs business development for Melotic, a distributed ledger service provider, and advises Hyperledger and a number of other blockchain startups.  ""If you look at blockchain as using cryptographic signatures to link the ledger from one point to next, then concept of a private blockchain makes perfect sense,"" Sams said. ""If you think the distinguishing feature of blockchain is the use of proof of work or proof or stake to solve for a Sybil attack, then it doesn't make sense.""   In short, anybody repeating the mantra ""no blockchain without Bitcoins"" is going to find themselves sorely mistaken. It's not so much a fact as a nervous justification-to-self."

We intentionally keep ratelimits low on BitMEX to encourage tooling writers to properly use our WebSocket instead of polling the HTTP API again and again. Polling via HTTP is a simpler mental model but it's slower for both parties.  We ended up in a situation where a user wanted to cancel orders but was ratelimited out of it. We calculate ratelimits on a rolling basis but he was still locked out for about 120 seconds and was understandably angry.  We simply added a simple clause to the ratelimiter that made order cancellations still count against your limit (like any other call), but if your limit is reached, order cancellations are still allowed to go through. Simple as that.  We also added a dead man's switch after further discussion with the user. Here's how it works: at intervals, the user sends a request at /order/cancelAllAfter with the payload {timeout: 30000} (that's 30,000ms, or 30s). This tells the server that if another hit to /order/cancelAllAfter is not received within 30 seconds, all orders will immediately be canceled. This is really useful in an outage."

Free trade only exists when the sovereignty of each actor engaged is maintained; if one actor is restrained and controlled by another, market efficiency is lost and a vassal state is created.

No doubt - voluntary wage participation is more efficient than slavery... irrespective of morality. Do you see the irony? While the North fought a war to protect their economic and political infrastructure, they did so by centralizing power in a unitary system and enslaving member states. Imagine you were in a domestic conflict, and when you tried to leave, your spouse went to the court and forced you to stay. Is that moral? Is that efficient trade?  Put another way, nullification and slavery were both constitutional in 1860. The states were free to amend the constitution, and any member state is free to withdraw from a trade agreement or other contract.

They weren't voting to leave the EU. They voted that they didn't want to pay their debts and have to accept huge cuts. They still have free trade anyway. Their right to con Daddy Germany into using his credit card is not defensible sovereign right, which is why I'm guessing they are getting bailed out instead.  They made themselves debt slaves and only have themselves to blame. Leave the libertarian crap at the door."

Problem is, 796 has a bonkers socialized loss system (okcoin much much better with insurance), and worse liquidity.

BitcoinMarkets,3d37hl,two_bit_misfit,15,Mon Jul 13 10:23:48 2015 UTC,"Some pretty impressive accumulation is underway on Bitfinex right now. About an hour ago, a hidden buy wall of $305.55 was being sold into; now, it seems like someone was baiting sellers at $305.00 with a never-ending visible buy wall. Every time it was sold into, it would instantly refill to a certain amount...first ~243 BTC, then ~83, which it's still at now.  While I typed this, a 1289.7 BTC sell wall sprung up at $306.30, and a bot now appears to be leeching penny shavings off of the asks filling up below it. I was about to predict that it would be pulled soon, and lo and behold it was indeed pulled as soon as it was nibbled away at...leaving the order book more balanced and the price free to bounce back up.  Edit: Correction: as shown on /u/lowstrife's chart, the $305.55 hidden order was actually a sell wall, not a buy wall."
BitcoinMarkets,3d37hl,lowstrife,8,Mon Jul 13 15:05:59 2015 UTC,Typical hidden walls. You can see it quite clearly on the 1m chart  https://www.tradingview.com/x/7b1qo2BO/  Absorbing all the selling and profit taking. The hidden order wasn't breached so we're still unsure to it's true size. I'd say ~1000BTC were pushed into it.
BitcoinMarkets,3d37hl,two_bit_misfit,3,Mon Jul 13 04:45:04 2015 UTC,"Yep!  Except that the difference (as I saw it) was that the $305.55 was a true hidden order (the book was, for example, $305.34 - $305.80, but all the sells hit $305.55)...however the long slog at $305.00 shown well on your chart seemed to be a different beast (it stayed on as a visible bid with a certain amount of BTC, but got instantly auto-refilled every time it was sold into).  What do you think about that behavior? Accumulation bot tempting sellers with never-ending morsels of BTC? Would be curious to know what you or someone like /u/deb0rk thinks of all that."
BitcoinMarkets,3d37hl,deb0rk,6,Mon Jul 13 05:22:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't catch most of that live, just some of the selling into $305.  One thing you should note w/ hidden BFX orders as seen on bitcoinwisdom's orderbook display, the ""refilling"" is an illusion whereby wisdom extrapolates what the order book should look like after an order goes through, simple subtraction. In 99% of cases, this works fine.  So the 233BTC or so bid that was there almost the entire time, was never touched until the very end after the hidden order was filled and I think 80 or so was left."

If so... perhaps one could do analysis to see the percentage of hidden vs public offers that traded, over time?"
BitcoinMarkets,3d37hl,xxDan_Evansxx,3,Mon Jul 13 11:53:28 2015 UTC,"Lots of bid and ask wall shenanigans observable.  Big bid and ask walls on futures as well.  I have noticed that sometimes when there is a big ask and I put in a large limit order at or above that price, the ask disappears and I don't fill with any size at all.  Does anyone know how you place an order like that?  To create an apparent bid or ask that isn't real at all?  The big bids usually get pulled as well... especially as the price runs away from them.  To me, they seem more real (fillable).  They pull to let the price come down to buy lower.  I think there are a lot of people trying to buy the dip, and it really isn't giving us much of one.  I got impatient and added some right before this most recent pullback (the most significant since we left the 270 range).  I can only imagine there are others like me and if this continues to run, the pullbacks will be unpredictable."

And the Eurozone has given Greece until Wednesday to get it passed.  What makes the sellers think this will pass the Parliament?

Also, the agreement will force Greece to put $55 billion worth of assets ( monuments, islands, etc.) to sell to the private market. You think Greeks will be ok with that?  http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0713/714382-greece/   Even before the final terms were known, his labour minister went on state television to denounce the terms.     However, in a sign of how hard it may be for Mr Tsipras to convince his own Syriza party to accept the deal, Labour Minister Panos Skourletis said the terms were unviable and would lead to new elections this year.      Mr Tsipras will now have to rush swathes of legislation through parliament this week to convince his 18 partners to release bridging funds to avert a state bankruptcy and just to begin negotiations on a three-year loan."

It's not about the absolute price level, it's about the speed at which the price level is achieved.  I'm waiting for price to rise into the $300s and remain there for several days, rising slowly.  The idea is that the next crash after will hold above $300.  When price rises quickly, it's always like a bomb that could explode at any moment with extreme volatility.  It's always better to wait a few days when a price level is reached before making a judgement based upon the attainment of that level.  If you're of the opinion that $287 has already confirmed the end of the bear trend, then this is a great opportunity to buy.  If you're like me and think that price needs to be higher for that confirmation, then you want to wait until after a crash that holds at that level to buy."

BitcoinMarkets,3d37hl,Jiecut,2,Mon Jul 13 09:00:58 2015 UTC,"Well I saw a clear pump and then it dumped afterwards.  Stabilizing above the price is basically natural in a pump in dump. You'll have distribution at the top. There are more bagholders now, people who got an interest in Litecoin on the way up. That's why pump and dump works because you get people to distribute to.  Pumps can be long term, litecoin could possibly make a new high now. And the pump would go into overdrive. Also they don't need to dump it all the way down.

BitcoinMarkets,3d37hl,biglambda,6,Mon Jul 13 07:24:47 2015 UTC,Sad to say it but that appears to be a bear pennant.
BitcoinMarkets,3d37hl,avocadosandham,3,Mon Jul 13 14:06:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure exactly where you say one 6 hours ago, but right now, there is definitely a clear bear pennant on the 15min and 30 min charts.  Me thinks bear whales are about to bend us over the bucket at least one more time. If they can push lower than $270-275 range, then our month long bull channel will look broken and lots of people will be selling into their scattered buys all the way down to $250ish. Then they wait for those people to buy back in when price starts drifting up, maybe backed by some positive news, and they get to repeat again."
BitcoinMarkets,3d37hl,biglambda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:20:25 2015 UTC,"I think there comes a point where the most profitable thing for anyone, whale or not, is just to go with the major movement of the market, which if current sentiment is correct is a bull. Whether this current segment is bearish consolidation or not, remains to be seen."
BitcoinMarkets,3d37hl,cvdsande,6,Mon Jul 13 08:45:22 2015 UTC,"If we retrace back to 250 in the next days, and this entire run up turns out to be another pump-and-dump, i am convinced and i am 100% out of bitcoin.  EDIT: holding 282 for now, fair enough. buying back panic sell. small profit."
BitcoinMarkets,3d37hl,mitchr4,10,Mon Jul 13 15:10:02 2015 UTC,why? 250 is a higher floor...250 would be a beautiful sign.

BitcoinMarkets,3d37hl,ronohara,3,Mon Jul 13 06:26:03 2015 UTC,That depends on the time frame.  On the 1D MACD price is just correcting to the MA and still a strong bull overall.  Day trading? 5M view ?  - I do not care about that view of things.

BitcoinMarkets,3d1548,imog,2,Mon Jul 13 02:54:54 2015 UTC,"I learned this approach from the price is right   It would make things even more interesting if we were playing some variant on ""Without going over"", where your bet is invalidated if the spot price ever goes even a dollar over your predicted high or below your predicted low.  There was a brief moment where I thought that was the rule in play, and was considering betting on everyone going 'bust' because they'd underestimated the volatility, and entering a guess of $0 - $1,000,000,000... quite disappointing to realise it was just ""closest guess""."
BitcoinMarkets,3d1548,noggin-scratcher,15,Mon Jul 13 00:28:06 2015 UTC,"So I made a chart of guesses which is kind of fun to look at.  Each column is one person; red dot for their predicted low (which are obviously in sorted order), green dot for their predicted high, and the two vertical grey lines are the bounds of the time-period in question... unfortunately there were slightly more dots than fit in the space available between them.  Predicted highs greater than the ATH are cut off as outliers, because I didn't want to make the image 10 times taller."

Made it easier on myself by scaling a screenshot so that 1 dollar was 1 pixel and '0' was the bottom edge of the image, then added the dots using the 'current location' coordinates at the bottom of Paint.net -- also heavy use of scrolling up/down while zoomed in, to ensure I stayed in the same column exactly."

Evidence from a month ago  I don't want to say something smells fishy, but something smells fishy to me. Where do you get 1k coins worth of daily volume in the Canadian market overnight?"
BitcoinMarkets,3d26hq,rabf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:18:17 2015 UTC,bitstamp and btc-e dance this tango all the time. from my understanding most Canadian bitcoiners don't even use exchanges and prefer OTC. this could simply represent those bitcoiners finally gaining comfortability with an exchange.
BitcoinMarkets,3d19vg,SatoshiReport,5,Sun Jul 12 18:15:06 2015 UTC,first you should never trade all in ever.   Next it sound like this is your first go at algo trading.. may i suggest you include more parameters ? You should take at a minimum some volume oscillator over time as a reality check and not go strictly by the tape.. You should factor per dollar risk on movement as well..20x is basically rape if your position size is larger then your bank really should support..   one of my first algos for btc test 98.3% in back testing against spot. Applied to 3x leverage is was ~%84 against 10x it was 82%. never bothered to test it on 20x on that guy.  also free hint your bot should know when the market turned against your position and ditch it..
BitcoinMarkets,3d19vg,nomadismydj,5,Mon Jul 13 05:26:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, leverage is important. Too many people ignore this and say ""herp derp it's just about risk management"", but that's what the bucket shops want you to think.  Although rather than say stick to non-leveraged, I would say modest leverage, like 3x, is probably optimal if you want to get some gearing but be responsible."
BitcoinMarkets,3d19vg,theswapman,3,Sun Jul 12 20:50:08 2015 UTC,Can backtesting against the normal distribution really predict future returns?
BitcoinMarkets,3d19vg,Sonarman,5,Mon Jul 13 06:51:13 2015 UTC,"For somebody less familiar, how do you do a montecarlo simulation for algotrading? I know how a basic P&L simulation would work -- make a trade then check at some later interval if you can trade out at a profit based on available size/price. For a Monte Carlo version what things do you randomize and what distributions do you use?"
BitcoinMarkets,3d19vg,tending,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:33:57 2015 UTC,Sorry I'm still not clear. As I see it your P&L on historical data can be calculated directly -- so I don't understand what you're randomizing.
BitcoinMarkets,3d19vg,tending,2,Mon Jul 13 10:47:37 2015 UTC,This is given with a $23 average return per trade with a standard deviation of $236.   This seems to be a problem.
BitcoinMarkets,3d19vg,Jiecut,2,Mon Jul 13 13:10:21 2015 UTC,"That's pretty typical.  If you were able to do much better, you'd be smashing the market, just total domination.  Basically, you'll get a normal curve of results; you just want the average exit to be higher than the entrance."
BitcoinMarkets,3d19vg,Sluisifer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:28:41 2015 UTC,Okay well this isn't really a well suited strategy for high leverage.  Also getting a $23 return with a standard deviation of $236 is basically a coinflip.  One thing I'm not considering is skew.
BitcoinMarkets,3d19vg,Jiecut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:13:56 2015 UTC,I would take that coinflip a million times over.

Without risk of losing their hats. You appear to just fan out your return distribution.  Consider using 10% position size instead, does this cancel the 10X leverage, do you get more stable results?"

At the request of /u/TheRugAteMyShoe, here's some in-depth analysis.  Here's an update on the current bull-run rainbow. That'll make it into the normal daily charts once we get a bit more confirmation.  I know some people around here aren't fans of my analysis - some with more valid reasons than others. However, I'm hoping those of you that trusted my charts are enjoying your +30% returns at the moment. I'd like to think my prediction was pretty good, even if the timings a little optimistic.  Historically the charts suggest we're about to go parabolic and an ATH by the end of August isn't impossible. But it is unlikely: the market's matured a lot since 2013.

These are all very long term indicators that don't align this way very often.  At the same time plenty of momentum to want to break through the psychological $300 level, so I'm proceeding cautiously.

BitcoinMarkets,3czdau,bitvote,23,Sun Jul 12 15:15:28 2015 UTC,we may be entering a period where we see fewer coins available on the market due to miners needing to sell less.  Miners can now match the revenue they'd get from selling a block reward by selling 70% fewer coins. And maybe they're inclined to hold a higher % of block reward coins in what appears to be the beginning of a bull market.   The daily sell pressure from mining might not increase beyond what we were seeing at $220-240. I'd bet daily sell pressure from miners actually decreases in USD terms over the next month+ (and throughout the bull run).
BitcoinMarkets,3czdau,HitMePat,9,Sun Jul 12 13:44:39 2015 UTC,Isn't it true that when price rises more hashing power gets added to bring the cost in USD per mined coin back into equilibreum?

I guess that means there's still some potential for a small boost from the litecoin market once some of them want to get back into bitcoin. And of course there's this whole halving thing coming up for litecoin which I suspect is what's keeping it above $5 in the first place right now. Should that pass without a significant pump for LTC, then I would expect most holders to quickly abandon ship."
BitcoinMarkets,3czdau,Jaysusmaximus,2,Sun Jul 12 14:29:03 2015 UTC,"43 days till LTC halving.  I believe there's plenty of time for more LTC FOMO as supply dries up and BTC continues to rally.

BitcoinMarkets,3czdau,saintoshi,7,Sun Jul 12 14:35:36 2015 UTC,$8-12 LTC coins are reasonable between now and the halving.    Based on what? Just because that's what litecoiners keep repeating? My estimation of a reasonable price for LTC is somewhere between $0 and $1.

BitcoinMarkets,3czdau,Jaysusmaximus,2,Sun Jul 12 17:36:39 2015 UTC,"My estimation of a reasonable price for LTC is somewhere between $0 and $1.   That makes me think you see a world where BTC is the only crypto in town.  Don't get me wrong, BTC is king and likely always will be - but there is room for alternative coins (though most will wither and die to nothing).  Litecoin has the most liquidity of all alts + is perceived as a cheap alternative to trade compared to BTC (given the liquidity) + is profitable to mine and trade with other alts.  You add this together and demand goes up during bull seasons in crypto.  I don't see Litecoin becoming a major player anytime soon but it has enough characteristics to warrant where it is right now."

BitcoinMarkets,3czdau,standardcrypto,13,Sun Jul 12 04:56:35 2015 UTC,"Same as previous bubbles, but people now buying bitcoin have more money, and there's more of them.  No serious institutional money yet.  No sovereign wealth funds.  Could be some family offices.  Some gold/commodity rebalancing into crypto.  Nothing's really changing with the dynamics, the biggest difference is probably the sellers (early bitrich, or those unlucky to buy at the top) are comfortable with the amount of btc they have unloaded and will be selling more slowly going forward, rather than the panicky feeling of last six months.  So it's largely a contraction in the supply side is my guess."
BitcoinMarkets,3czdau,saintoshi,10,Sun Jul 12 07:04:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Sellers are sold out, and buyers have gained new confidence.

BitcoinMarkets,3czdau,deb0rk,2,Sun Jul 12 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"I suppose you could look at depth sums, particularly the bidside, as a rough gauge of new money entering market. Credits to coinsight for all these graphs of historical bid/sum depths.   Bitstamp - Not much change, obviously Stamp has been on the decline in terms of market share in last year. A few wiggles in the recent month or so, but sharp jumps which suggest 1 or 2 larger players moving about an otherwise shallow market.  Bitfinex - Not much change over the last half year, and recent month mostly spikes from one very large player that otherwise would be a rather flat result. BTCE - Not much change in last year almost, has actually gone down in last month until just last few days. I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess it's due to the LTC bubble.   Coinbase - Definitely some notable growth, reaching its highest bid depth since the site launched. As evident from the spikes here and there, there are some big market makers who make up a good portion of the market. BTCChina - Definitely a bit of an uptick, but gets dwarfed by what look like massive market maker spikes both historically and recently(http://coinsight.org/graphs/btcchina_btccny_depth_30d.png). Huobi - Still towards bottom of last half year or so, but definitely some increase in last month.   Overall, there hasn't been much movement in the larger markets in context of the last year or even half year. Frankly, it looks like after the decline at beginning of year, a lot of fiat money left the market. I suspect some of that China flowed from spot markets to the increasingly popular BTC Futures markets. Some might guess the Chinese stock markets as well. There is definitely a bit of an uptick from the lows, during the 'period of stability' or whatever, which isn't surprising given the 40% price jump. Most promising chart really seems to be Coinbase, showing a possible inflow of retail traders in the US, though at scale of $1.5 to $3M and about 2.5% of the global volume in the last 30 days, it's still a small player in the global scene."

I would keep a close eye on it because as it approaches 0.8 we are likely nearing a local top and hit would be wise to take some profits.

Thanks for asking, I'm going to start reaching out to the exchanges and asking them how many new users have been registering and perhaps write up a report on it."
BitcoinMarkets,3czdau,dabicon,7,Sun Jul 12 11:57:31 2015 UTC,I think right now it's people coming off the sidelines.  Old players already involved just have been partially cashed out.  I think new money will be involved soon in price trend continues.  Way of the herd.

BitcoinMarkets,3czdau,Mage777,3,Sun Jul 12 12:37:53 2015 UTC,The accumulation phase is usually a period of tight consolidation and low volume. I think the increase in volume and volatility shows we're transitioning out.

BitcoinMarkets,3czdau,Jiecut,2,Sun Jul 12 18:48:38 2015 UTC,"To all the people who faced losses because of shorting before the fomo up, you're lucky that okcoin is putting up 1k btc and 1k btc from the insurance fund.  Open interest around that time was 340k contracts. If you say 120k contracts got force liquidated at 10x leverage, that's less than 4k BTC. I think it should be a decent payback.  Also /u/lowstrife lot's of open interest already. Nearing 500k. Top holders is stacked. Weird one source says 500k one says 410k.  Anyways top holders is stacked currently. I hope the 250 btc insurance fund will be sufficient.  https://www.okcoin.com/future/futureTop.do?type=0&symbol=0"
BitcoinMarkets,3czdau,lowstrife,7,Sun Jul 12 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"Actually not all of those positions got liquidated. Only about 250 positions totalling about 14,000BTC on leverage got liquidated (on both sides, up then down).   The vast majority of the volume was people market closing their positions once they could log in. The below is a chart on a non-linear time axis of the liquidations that happened in the system.   http://i.imgur.com/7jd0mpH.png  Volume is represented in BTC's, for a total of ~14,000. This is weekly futures only.  So for those who didn't get liquidated but still lost 50% of their money by manually closing their trade... You likely are SOL. But if you did get liquidated then you likely will get that insurance fund.  We haven't had a major need for insurance in a while, so I think the 250 remaining BTC will be... sufficient hopefully until we get another major move. Remember, in that giant spike up to $360, every existing liquidation got filled when it came back down and there are none remaining on the books really. Bitcoin isn't volatile enough to leave them hanging anymore, which is great."
