retiredusername,3b9kzu,Vaidurya,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:06:28 2015 UTC,"It's rule #1 in the sidebar. Get the permalink for the comment you're pointing to, and add ""?context=#"" at the end, where # is the amount of parent-posts you want included.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3b8brt/what_question_have_you_always_wanted_to_ask_but/csjurh6?context=4  Here, csjurh6 was the alphanumeric assigned by Reddit to represent Box_in_a_Box's post, while context=4 was a little overkill, since there are only three parent posts available above the necessary link.  You're kind of lucky in that this subreddit isn't super strict, or your post could have been removed due to technically breaking rule #1. Rules are important, and when it comes to testing links, you can always plug them into your browser to see if they're the one you need, or if they need to be adjusted. Hell, I did it from my phone.  ETA: it follows google query requirements, and the ?identifier=value is common in many computer languages."

A minute later (I believe this is the correct username) /u/PleaseRespectTables responded with an emoticon that shows the table being turned right-side-up.  I wouldn't retire that username because that redditor could reasonably show back up any time a table is flipped and make his presence known.    So I suppose that it's possible that /u/thebutton's username could be really relevant to a later post, but because it's so perfect for such a one-time reference, it seems worth ""retiring.""
