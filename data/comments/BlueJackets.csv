I wasn't cogent enough to watch him during his prime, but was he technically better than our 72 over the course of his career? Or is the list just who played best while wearing that number?  Also, I love that our GoalieBob doesn't wear 30, 31, or 1. It makes me happy."

BlueJackets,3e2hyu,GeekYogurt,4,Wed Jul 22 03:15:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, how much of his lack of success has been due to playing in Edmonton?    I can't help but think the reclamation project here could be one that people consider a fleecing 5 years down the road for Columbus."
BlueJackets,3e2hyu,nunoveaux,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:35 2015 UTC,"It's possible that part of his performance is due to playing in Edmonton, but I'm sure it's not all of it. Ehrhoff is a bit older, but has a proven record (i.e. fancystats) to show that he consistently drives play. Schultz does not.  At a cheap price, he could be worth taking a risk on, but we're not quite in the right place to take the chance, ESPECIALLY if this is is true ceiling."
BlueJackets,3e2hyu,ranatalus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe get Ehrhoff on a 1 year deal to test his health (and aging). After that, see what Edmonton does with Schultz's RFA status."

BlueJackets,3e1a3l,ranatalus,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:18 2015 UTC,"This makes so much sense. Connauton and Prout are interchangeable on the 3rd pair and barring injuries, these pairings could take us far."

BlueJackets,3e1a3l,HermanBonJovi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:48 2015 UTC,Does anyone think there is chance we see a trade to free up space before training camp?  Maybe Hartnell (I would hate to see this.) for picks or prospect.  This would free up some salary and open a spot for Rychel to make the big club.
BlueJackets,3e1a3l,secretpenguin,10,Tue Jul 21 14:01:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think Hartnell is going that easily (he has a no move clause), and to trade a proven veteran NHL player for a CHANCE that Rychel COULD be good this year or next is too risky of a move for our forward chemistry."
BlueJackets,3e1a3l,SomeKindOfMonster,4,Tue Jul 21 14:14:30 2015 UTC,We are going to lose Bourque's contract after this season (3.33 mil) and Boll's contract (1.5 mil) after two. I don't think cap space will be that much of an issue.
BlueJackets,3e1a3l,xam2y,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:46 2015 UTC,"The way I see it now, we've got like a three to five year window that we could legitimately push for a Cup.

BlueJackets,3dzcu3,stephentszuter,7,Mon Jul 20 19:31:18 2015 UTC,"This is a marketing question... and I'm a marketer.  It comes down to awareness and trust.  If you're aware of StubHub and trust the service, there IS no reason you would buy from Ticketmaster if the seats you want are cheaper on StubHub.   If you're unaware of StubHub, or for some reason are afraid of it, then you pay out the butt.  Simple as that.  TL/DR: People make decisions based on the knowledge they have.  Edit: Ticketmaster is also well aware of this... given that not only have they entered the secondary ticket market with ""Ticket Exchange,"" but all their marketing for it uses words like ""verified"" and ""trusted"" to falsely imply StubHub has issues in these areas."
BlueJackets,3dzcu3,GeekYogurt,2,Mon Jul 20 19:54:35 2015 UTC,"Yup, exactly this. It's wholly marketing. From the seller side it is a bit easier to sell on ticket exchange since basically you just hit a button but there isn't a real, significant difference in the services outside of price.  Personally when I wasn't a season ticket holder I always used Stubhub. 2 years ago I think I probably bought 15-16 games and never had an issue."

BlueJackets,3dzcu3,IamTrogdor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:08 2015 UTC,"I buy 90% of my games from stub hub and save a ton of $$$.  Supply and demand make the tickets cheaper for CBJ.  Sadly when you have a historically underperforming team, there is generally not a big demand for tickets.  When they are making a playoff run the supply is less than demand and stub hub prices will be greater than ticketmaster.  Hopefully we have a handful of winning seasons and demand goes up...  We will pay more...  But it will be worth it...  CBJ!!!!!"
BlueJackets,3dzcu3,AnOldVillain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:44:42 2015 UTC,"If its an 'event' type game (opening night, playoffs, holiday, big game, etc etc) and you for sure have to be there, ticketmaster is the way to go imo. If youre on the fence a bit or generally willing to wait until the last minute (say a random weekday) then stubhub will probably save you money.  Sometimes if you're willing to look ahead and find a deal you can save a ton on stubhub."
BlueJackets,3dzcu3,nunoveaux,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:51 2015 UTC,"Just to give you an out-of-market perspective... If you look around at other popular teams in other markets, the going price is actually higher than face value.  This, of course, has more to do with the assumption that the game will be sold out and you're going to have a much harder time finding cheaper tickets, let alone the ultimate get of cheap+great seats.  While traveling, I've visited other arenas or specifically sought out Stanley Cup Playoff games and bought tickets for more-than-face regularly for this exact reason. Columbus has always been a best bang-for-buck... and for good reason: Success of the team, marketplace, what else is going on in town mean you can pick up lower bowl for below face.   Consider this team/situation pretty fortunate in that you don't need to worry about the price being gouged."
BlueJackets,3dzcu3,Drithyin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:09 2015 UTC,The same happens in Columbus for sell-out games here as well. Opening night will likely be higher than face value.
BlueJackets,3dzcu3,nunoveaux,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:34 2015 UTC,"Yep -- Opening/Closing night, rivalry games, invasion games are always going to buck the trend.  But, picking a Tuesday night game against the Coyotes will usually net a bargain price in Lower Bowl a few days before or day-of."
BlueJackets,3duymq,NLP19,8,Sun Jul 19 18:54:59 2015 UTC,"For the right price, I'd take him"
BlueJackets,3duymq,threeagle,11,Sun Jul 19 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"If we got him for 1 or 2 years, 1.5-2 mill AAV, that would be very satisfactory. The question is would he take it?"
BlueJackets,3duymq,SomeKindOfMonster,5,Sun Jul 19 19:14:26 2015 UTC,I think if we really liked him we could make a move or two to free up $$ to sign him. I wouldn't really care about the money tbh if it's a 1 year deal tho.
BlueJackets,3duymq,WannabeFinn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"This is not feasible unfortunately. He's going to be seeking somewhere in the range of $3.5m AAV, but from previous reports he's willing to accept short deals (1-2 years).  If CBJ thinks he's really on board, I think the solution is to ship Bourque out as quick as possible, even if it's not for a great return (1-2 late picks) just to clear cap space."
BlueJackets,3duymq,ranatalus,8,Tue Jul 21 14:03:49 2015 UTC,I'm still looking forward to the tell-all book a decade from now about the 2016 cup champion CBJ team that explains why we hurried Wiz out of here.

BlueJackets,3duymq,CrazyLegLaFleur1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"Sort of... If we end up signing a guy like Erhoff, the combined cap hit with Borque will be greater than Wiz."

Also I think it was partly due to the realization that we were not getting enough bang for our buck. He was just paid too much, it wasn't his fault but as a team we are getting to a point where we can't overpay players especially when we have Clarkson."
BlueJackets,3duymq,CrazyLegLaFleur1,2,Sun Jul 19 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"If we sign a couple solid defensemen to make a push this year, we just might have a chance at it.  Barring another injury disaster, we'll go far into the playoffs this year as is."

BlueJackets,3duymq,nunoveaux,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:20:10 2015 UTC,"It would be, but I think that what he'd want for one year and what we can pay are to fast apart. Portzline was looking at Falk and maybe Goloubef as pieces to move to free up space, but I still think we would need to move a forward or two. Unless we can pull off a trade of some role player types, I don't see us having the room for a big ticket defenseman. Maybe after camp, or maybe at the trade deadline."
BlueJackets,3duymq,notwhoithink,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:50:02 2015 UTC,"The whole point of the article was that Ehrhoff's price might be going down quite between now and when he finally does find a suitor. It'd be a good win if they were to get him on a 1yr deal at much lower than his 4m/yr price tag in Pittsburgh.  It can be done... if Golo and Falk are in the AHL, that clears about 1.9m (600k unspent, 600k for Falk, 700k for Golo) before that bonus ""buffer"" that Ehrhoff could realistically take.  People forget how insanely screwed some teams are with the cap right now, and the CAD is still in freefall which could affect teams during the season and into next offseason... we're going to see some funny things happen with player salary in the next 12-18 months."
BlueJackets,3duymq,nunoveaux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:09:03 2015 UTC,I agree with your last point about the wired economy. That's why I am very concerned with our cap situation. With a weak Canadian dollar we could see the cap actually go down.

BlueJackets,3dnslg,notwhoithink,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:17:43 2015 UTC,The jersey was $150 or something and I think the custom stitching was $70. I cant remember exactly because it was a gift. I definitely think it is worth it though.

BlueJackets,3dmrfh,habituallysuspect,3,Fri Jul 17 15:18:51 2015 UTC,Couch to 5k is great. I did it a few years and I got suuuuper skinny. There are a handful of awesome free apps that use the same workout routine if you wanted something to time your runs for you.  Now that I'm fat again I should probably consider giving it another go...
BlueJackets,3dmrfh,Juicewag,4,Fri Jul 17 16:46:28 2015 UTC,Also I use the C25K official app. It's quite nice when I did it like 6 years ago I had to do all the timing myself so the app is a fucking godsend

BlueJackets,3dmk7t,notwhoithink,2,Fri Jul 17 17:17:02 2015 UTC,"Well then by that logic Ryan Johansen is on the trading block... All it takes is ""one call""...  Don't forget that Nash still has a 7.8m cap hit for 3 more seasons. Most teams are capped out and can't take that hit right now even if they clear cap space, which most aren't doing as they've largely set their rosters for camp.  The best indication of the state of the league's finances is the fact that guys like Franson and Ehrhoff are still out there with no teams."
BlueJackets,3dmk7t,nunoveaux,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:33:02 2015 UTC,I would take him back. Anyone else?

BlueJackets,3dmk7t,notwhoithink,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:00:54 2015 UTC,True and we really need a player of that caliber on the blueline rather than at forward

BlueJackets,3dfhc9,WannabeFinn,2,Thu Jul 16 07:20:41 2015 UTC,Yeah that actually makes a lot more sense. I'm just eager to see him do well because I'm a newer fan and he is the first prospect I've watched develop. (Dano come back üò≠üò≠)

BlueJackets,3de92d,buckeye_baker,19,Thu Jul 16 02:50:06 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you about Jeff Carter. Once upon a time the Blue Jackets had a star player named Rick Nash. He was elite. He was great. And there weren't that many pieces around him. So our organization traded for a bad, evil man named Jeff Carter.  Jeff Carter was supposed to be Nash's new linemate. He was our symbol to Nasher that we were committed to winning with him. Only Carter didn't want to win with us. He whined and cried about coming to Columbus and forced our GM and Rick Nash to actually physically go to his beach house and put him on a plane to Cbus.  Once finally in Cbus he was a pretty good player. But he was so miserable and so hateful to be here that the team eventually had to trade him to LA - after being on the CBJ less than a year.   Rick Nash left, and eventually we all saw we were better off. But as a new CBJ fan it is important for you to know this tale so that you will always remember this: Fuck Jeff Carter."

BlueJackets,3d4dsg,archaic_entity,4,Mon Jul 13 12:47:59 2015 UTC,"Single game tickets will probably go on sale in September. Section 104 is behind visitor bench. Sections 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 101, 102 are all visitor attack twice. Sections 116 and 102 are the most expensive, sections 117 and 101 are a little cheaper, and 118 through 122 are all the cheapest out of these sections. Sections 117 through 101 have mezzanine seats that are even cheaper than being lower in those sections, but they are still great seats (some seats have slightly obstructed views).  I have been in many of the sections and sat in many areas of the arena, there are no bad seats. If you enjoy feeling like you are part of the game sit in the lower sections that I mentioned before. If you want to save money and just be at the game, the upper bowl is a little more laid back, but seats are smaller and the excitement level isn't as high (in my opinion).   Being a visiting fan, from what I have seen we generally aren't dicks to other fans unless they are acting like a bunch of cunts. There have been a lot of games with more visiting fans than Jacket fans. At least in my experience, I am used to visiting fans being around and you might get some playful trash talk or jokes but as long as you play along and aren't combative we will leave you alone. That being said, I am sure there are some jackasses that will be there and give you a hard time, ignore the drunks and have fun with the rest of us normal fans.  Hope this is helpful, and I hope to see you there in October. Feel free to message me if you have any other questions."

I second what hobo said. Generally a good fan base here and you will mostly be respected/ignored. The lower bowl is worth the money imo but there really isn't a bad seat. If I'm in a mood to just watch hockey for watching hockey, i'll go the first few rows of the upper bowl. should be electric on opening night... i know i'll be there!  have fun, but I hope we kick the rags ass!"

I dont remember exactly but hopefully that is enough to give you an idea of what to set aside for september.  The R-Bar is the hockey bar downtown, but it fills up fast before and after the games like a couple of other people have said. If the R-Bar is full or its after like 5 to 530 and I know it is filling up I usually walk about 2 blocks (maybe less) to Max and Erma's. They have a decent sized bar and usually don't fill up as quickly as R-Bar or some of the other bars around the arena. It is just somewhere to grab a couple beers (that arent $9 a piece) and a bite to eat that wont break the bank. It is usually easy to get in and out of before the game.   But if you go toward the outer section of the arena district there are a ton of bars very close together. A few weekend games we have bar hopped in this area beforehand. Google Map of the Bars around. These bars are about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the arena.  Hope you have a great time while your'e here."

I like that we have a third jersey now, I don't mind the updated cannon patch on the primary, but I wouldn't want to see an overhaul unless it was for a Winter Classic or something like that.  What we have now is good, I'd like to see it become our identity."
BlueJackets,3cx1fr,utpyro34,3,Sat Jul 11 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda meh on the first and second, but definitely not liking that third: I really only like the tan with the lighter blue, definitely not matching that tan with the union blue.  But as far as making the cannon our main logo? I'm on the fence. The cannon is cool, but the star is too."
BlueJackets,3cx1fr,KyConair,3,Sat Jul 11 15:23:03 2015 UTC,Nah. I like what they have now.   Only thing I would add is an away version of the cannon jersey.
BlueJackets,3cx1fr,SAL_CD,3,Sat Jul 11 18:28:55 2015 UTC,No thanks. I don't like the cannon as a logo and that third jersey looks like prison garb.
BlueJackets,3cx1fr,MadDog1981,3,Sun Jul 12 02:34:40 2015 UTC,I was just about to say that.
BlueJackets,3cx1fr,PorkSwordAllStar,2,Sun Jul 12 14:11:02 2015 UTC,"I definitely like the cannon logo and am glad the new shoulder patch uses it more but I think the home and away jerseys you have here look outdated already. As for the 3rd, the cream color is what I like the most about the current ones"
BlueJackets,3cx1fr,JakeCBJ,2,Sat Jul 11 15:33:18 2015 UTC,No way.  I think the CBJ primary set is the best looking modern-style jersey in the NHL.
BlueJackets,3cx1fr,lat3ralus65,2,Sat Jul 11 22:50:24 2015 UTC,"Flag logo is best logo.  I certainly love the canon patch, and the current 3rd sweaters so much, but the Ohio flag on the sweater is awesome. I have a plain blue CBJ hat with the flag logo on it, and people always tell me how awesome it is, and ask what team it is for (I'm in Cinti).  Both logos are really great actually, but the flag is the better of the two."

BlueJackets,3cody3,HardKnockRiffe,2,Thu Jul 9 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much been their policy since Jarmo became GM (maybe even before that?), but we almost always get the AAV reported by Porty or someone else within like ~30 minutes or so of the announcement. So because of that, I don't mind the policy too much."
BlueJackets,3cody3,andrewdt10,8,Thu Jul 9 17:01:01 2015 UTC,"Now there's no way Jared Boll can get any playtime, right? RIGHT??"
BlueJackets,3cody3,nananiel,6,Thu Jul 9 15:39:00 2015 UTC,Can we just forget to put him on the plane after the first West Coast trip?
BlueJackets,3cody3,ShakespearInTheAlley,3,Thu Jul 9 17:25:47 2015 UTC,I was hoping they snuck him in that trade with Chicago and no one had found out about it yet.
BlueJackets,3cody3,MadDog1981,5,Fri Jul 10 01:46:54 2015 UTC,Woot!  Matty Hustle!
BlueJackets,3cody3,HermanBonJovi,6,Thu Jul 9 14:09:08 2015 UTC,MATTY HUSTLE
BlueJackets,3cody3,Ticov1,3,Thu Jul 9 15:22:58 2015 UTC,DO THE HUSTLE
BlueJackets,3cody3,SomeKindOfMonster,5,Thu Jul 9 15:37:28 2015 UTC,"the contract value is great given his ability to play effectively in the middle 6 but given our cap situation and forward depth I'm not sure we can afford to keep him for the duration of this deal  he'll make for a nice trade chip, though.. some team close to the cap in need of a solid middle 6 winger will want him badly"
BlueJackets,3cody3,WannabeFinn,3,Thu Jul 9 16:38:30 2015 UTC,"You also have to think:   Bourque is in his last year before UFA. His 3.33 mil AAV contract will be gone. I'm almost certain he will not return given our depth at forward. Boll has two years left at 1.7 mil AAV. If he plays flat this year like last year, then he'll likely get bought out with a year left on his contract.   source  Now, we have ~$4 mil in cap space right now [if you don't count potential bonuses]. And you can imagine the cap will probably go up ~$1 mil next year. So think $5 mil under the cap, and you would need to sign Ryan Murray (probably a short-term bridge because of his health unless he plays most of the games this year), David Savard, Dalton Prout, Boone Jenner, and Kevin Connauton. So, we could have a cap issue, but I doubt it. The contracts for Murray and Jenner will almost certainly be a result of their play this year and whether or not they can stay healthy.  So ~$5 mil under the cap now, then ~$8.33 mil after Bourque's contract is gone. And you have room to sign some players. And obviously anyone getting traded would help the bottom line, too.  edit: clarification for the simple."
BlueJackets,3cody3,andrewdt10,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:08:10 2015 UTC,"Now, we have ~$4 mil in cap space right now.   Yeah, about that.  The ""Calvert signing"" article on BlueJacketsXtra has us at only $500k under the cap.  Apparently they have to count potential bonuses for players on entry-level contracts against the cap until it is clear that they cannot actually meet the terms to earn them.  So...we've basically got no wiggle room this season without moving players and salary."
BlueJackets,3cody3,notwhoithink,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:37:47 2015 UTC,"Apparently they have to count potential bonuses for players on entry-level contracts against the cap until it is clear that they cannot actually meet the terms to earn them.   Haven't read the Dispatch article but I'd assume that those bonuses are mostly (if not exclusively) going to Ryan Murray. His ELC is up after this season, so that money also goes off the cap.  They may not have wiggle room on paper, but keep in mind that 1) teams will take on contracts to make salaries work in a trade (which is why we have Bourque in the first place) and 2) we have guys in the pipeline (Bjork, Milano, Rychel, Anderson, Karlsson, Chaput, Moutrey, Paliotta, Madaisky, Falk, etc.) who could fill in for extended periods of time if needed.  This isn't going to be another team trotting out Sean Collins, Frederic St-Denis and Adam Cracknell."
BlueJackets,3cody3,NotMittRomney,0,Fri Jul 10 04:14:02 2015 UTC,You'll notice in my post where I'm talking about the time after next season when Bourque's contract is up. Hence why I ignored this season's performance bonuses.

You're talking about now.  Right now.  It's OK to be wrong on the internet.  There's no need to tie yourself up in knots trying to twist your words to make sure that you look like you never made a mistake.

BlueJackets,3cody3,notwhoithink,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:06:53 2015 UTC,I guess a [if you don't count potential bonuses] would be better served there.

And you don't have to be a dick about it.

BlueJackets,3cody3,johnny5_is_alive,4,Thu Jul 9 14:50:04 2015 UTC,"Wow, 2.2  AAV is a very generous contract"
BlueJackets,3cody3,nunoveaux,6,Thu Jul 9 14:40:24 2015 UTC,I think he's worth it if he stays healthy. He works his ass off.
BlueJackets,3cody3,highvoltorb,5,Thu Jul 9 14:42:45 2015 UTC,if he stays healthy   Exactly -- if we get over 70 games out of him a season then I'm happy.

BlueJackets,3cody3,johnny5_is_alive,2,Thu Jul 9 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"He's most certainly worth that as long as he plays like he did last year (and stays healthy). But think about it, even though he plays on the 4th line, he also kills penalties and is a huge pest on the forecheck. 2.2 mil AAV is a fucking steal for Matty Hustle."
BlueJackets,3cody3,andrewdt10,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:03:01 2015 UTC,Who kills penalties?
BlueJackets,3cody3,Cortezthecarpenter,2,Wed Jul 15 05:42:05 2015 UTC,"just depends on how healthy the team stays stays because his career PPG indicates 2.2m/yr is an underpayment, however he's unlikely to replicate such numbers on the 4th line"
BlueJackets,3cody3,WannabeFinn,2,Thu Jul 9 16:39:39 2015 UTC,Underlying numbers-wise he's a middle-6 guy and could theoretically be on the 2nd line instead of down on the 4th. 2.2 for a guy who can do 2nd line isn't bad at all.
BlueJackets,3cody3,topcopontheforce,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:05:07 2015 UTC,That's kinda what I thought.  Hopefully this doesn't end up being like Boll's contract in a couple of years.

BlueJackets,3cpeaw,71Duster360,5,Thu Jul 9 18:31:03 2015 UTC,I think sometimes people forget what a coup it was to get JD from St. Louis. Even this old article makes you think about how far we've come as a franchise. I know the work isn't over yet but I think the coming years will be a golden age for the CBJ
BlueJackets,3cpeaw,Ticov1,3,Thu Jul 9 19:42:12 2015 UTC,"There's a story floating around about the round of head coaching interviews conducted by Mike Priest that eventually landed Scott Arniel, with Priest using executive management clich√© questions, and the unnamed (might have been Guy Boucher) coach responding something to the effect of ""What does that have to do with coaching an f'n hockey team?""  In short: there were some dark, dark times that continued well after Doug MacLean was fired in 2007 and Mike Priest took over. Craig Patrick, then John Davidson are the reason this franchise finally found its way out of some really terrible times."
BlueJackets,3cpeaw,nunoveaux,2,Thu Jul 9 21:31:58 2015 UTC,man FUCK Scott Arniel. Dark times indeed
BlueJackets,3cpeaw,darthgallion,3,Fri Jul 10 13:35:52 2015 UTC,It really does defy God that Brassard is thriving in New York while Arniel is an assistant there.
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,andrewdt10,5,Thu Jul 9 17:14:42 2015 UTC,"I personally think the #CBJ will be quiet through the rest of the summer and training camp before the start of the season. And I see our roster looking like this:  Saad - Johansen - Atkinson  Hartnell - Wennberg - Foligno  Jenner - Dubinsky - Clarkson  Calvert - Campbell - Bourque/Boll  Johnson - Savard  Murray - Goloubef  Tyutin - Prout/Connauton  Bobrovsky  McElhinney  As much as I'd like to see Milano, Rychel, Bjorkstrand, or Anderson make the team, I just don't think there are any roster spots available unless someone really blows the socks off of management. And obviously this whole situation would change if a trade happened and some players were shipped off."
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,SomeKindOfMonster,4,Thu Jul 9 17:17:54 2015 UTC,I think I would swap Dubi/Wennsy as far as 2nd and 3rd line is concerned. Jenner and Hartsy could also probably be swapped. We have too many talented forwards - what a problem to have.
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,ScarletWitch65,3,Thu Jul 9 17:29:19 2015 UTC,"I think it'll be Dubi and Jenner on the second line Hartnell-Wennberg-possibly Rychel on the third. Unless Clarkson or Borque (or Boll?) makes huge strides this year, they'll be fourth liners.  Also, Murray is definitely top pairing defenseman if he stays healthy."
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,highvoltorb,9,Thu Jul 9 17:32:55 2015 UTC,Hahahaha Boll huge strides hahaha

BlueJackets,3cp3t8,HermanBonJovi,2,Fri Jul 10 01:04:15 2015 UTC,Id not count out a healthy Clarkson.  His time in toronto wasnt great but he was pretty good in NJ. A new start with a team that doesnt have all the pressure of being in toronto could be what he needs to return to form. I hope.
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,MadDog1981,0,Fri Jul 10 13:33:18 2015 UTC,I think Clarkson is going to be a third line guy because of his salary. I see him being a problem all year due to performance vs. them justifying his salary by playing him too high in the lineup.
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,im_in_the_safe,5,Fri Jul 10 01:51:23 2015 UTC,No coach worth his salt would ever make decisions on the lineup  based on the player's salary. Ever.
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,BanterDTD,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:06:27 2015 UTC,"I think Clarkson is going to be a third line guy because of his salary.   People here tend to forget that Clarkson was a very good player when in the correct role. Toronto came in, and offered him a lot of money and tried to make him something he is not.   Now he is with a team that plays a physical style ( like he did in New Jersey), and won't be counting on him to be a main point producer. I would expect to see a bit of a return to form for Clarkson, though he will never produce numbers that justify his contract.  It seems everyone likes to take shots at Clarkson for his contract, but lets remember that is not his fault. Toronto is the one that offered him that."
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,MadDog1981,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:28:41 2015 UTC,You're forgetting age is a factor as well. Toronto might have not used him well but he's also declining physically.

That's a pretty safe bet, seeing that we only have $500k in salary cap room.  I think that after JK was unable to get us a defenseman over draft weekend that he decided to stand pat and see what happens.  If the young guys progress and Murray stays healthy then we can most likely get by at least until the trade deadline.  If things start looking sketchy during pre-season then expect some more of our forward depth to be traded."
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,jpsquill,4,Thu Jul 9 18:50:09 2015 UTC,We have around $3.7 mil left in cap space.

Source   The new deal carries a salary-cap hit of $2.2 million, and pushes the Blue Jackets salary cap figure to $70.9 million, the highest in franchise history. The NHL's salary cap for 2015-16 is $71.4 million.   and   In the Blue Jackets' $70.9 million figure is a ""bonus cushion"" of $3.1 million for players on entry-level contracts who are eligible for performance bonuses   We literally have $500k in usable cap space."

BlueJackets,3cp3t8,WannabeFinn,6,Thu Jul 9 17:28:45 2015 UTC,"If Bjorkstrand is able to pull that off, something tells me management wouldn't be that upset."
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,Bubbz1211,5,Thu Jul 9 17:32:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know. But that means we could only carry 7 D if both Boll and Bourque are scratched. I believe GMJK said he wants to carry 8 D because of injuries and because he doesn't want to lose someone on waivers when he has to call them up for an injury and send em back down."
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,highvoltorb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, we know they'd prefer to keep 8 D, but if Bjorkstrand or another young guy is fucking killing it, then I don't see them getting that upset to carrying 14 F's."
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,Bubbz1211,3,Thu Jul 9 17:46:47 2015 UTC,I like the hartnell and wenny combo. I think put them with foligno to spread the talent and not have foligno with Joey and saad.

BlueJackets,3cp3t8,overcatastrophe,3,Thu Jul 9 23:46:08 2015 UTC,I think Jarmo should offer Boll for free to any team that's below the salary floor (or at least for a minor draft pick)  Boll doesn't have a no-trade/movement clause
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,GeekYogurt,3,Thu Jul 9 22:28:11 2015 UTC,Rated 66 in EA NHL15... Lol. Most teams don't have anyone under 70. That's gotta feel shitty to fire up your Xbox and see you are the worst player in the league.

BlueJackets,3cp3t8,overcatastrophe,2,Fri Jul 10 01:41:10 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the animosity comes from his paycheck. If he were making 700k on the 4th line, I think people would take it a lot easier on him."
BlueJackets,3cp3t8,xam2y,3,Fri Jul 10 01:46:50 2015 UTC,I would still want him gone. Tropp made nothing and I couldn't stand him either. Boll is just a terrible hockey player.

It should be a site to see, and I loved watching your run at the end of the season, only sad but was what could have been without all the injuries.  I am excited about Arty and Dano, hoping Toews/Hoss get a chance to mold Dano into the new Saad.  I think most fans are upset because Saader was a fan favorite and it was a little surprising... but I don't begrudge him getting paid or moving to another team.

Now I don't blame him, he's a Chicago hockey blogger.  He follows the Blackhawks, and he writes about the Blackhawks.  While watching the Blackhawks he sees lots of Western Conference teams, and has only seen a couple of CBJ games in the past few seasons.  When the CBJ was in the Western Conference we were NOT a strong team, not anything close to where we are today.  If you asked him to name three big events from CBJ history he would probably say ""1. Trading for Saad, 2. Trading for Bobrovsky, 3. Trading away Nash"".  Now if he had followed hockey in general, or much of anything outside of the Blackhawks then he probably would have a much different perspective.  He would probably know something about how strongly we played the Pens in the playoffs.  He would probably know that we were tipped to win the Metro last season before losing 520+ man-games to injury.  He would probably know that despite the horrible season that we had last year that we still finished out the season with one of the best second-half records in the league, and he would also know that we have been tipped by pundits to be one of the best teams in the east this season.  But he doesn't know that, because all he knows are the Chicago Blackhawks.  He's just a homer, that's all."

Saad does only know success and it's going to be interesting to watch how he handles any failures he may encounter with the CBJ (I mean, let's be honest - we're not a powerhouse team...yet). Also, Saad likely wouldn't have been an also-ran in Chicago much longer - especially given the fact that other more ""prominent"" guys ahead of him faltered pretty drastically last season while he shined through.   What amazes me is how little these guys understand about the player's union and how their CBA works. Guys get lambasted for taking undercut deals because the owners turn around and use those deals as benchmarks for the next CBA/salary cap. There is a take-as-much-as-you-can get atmosphere when it comes to free agents signing with teams, so it only makes sense that Saad was going to leave regardless of whether he were traded or not."

BlueJackets,3cojvt,AtTheRink,3,Thu Jul 9 14:48:29 2015 UTC,Unless Ryan Murray plays +70 games each season for the next two seasons and has his name thrown around for the Norris (not necessarily top 3 but top 5-10 d-men) there is no way he's getting paid 4.25 mil
BlueJackets,3cojvt,Dr_James_Rustler,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:59:35 2015 UTC,The most likely situation is probably a 2-3 yr bridge deal with a $3-ish mil AAV until he can get some playing time without any major injuries. I'd be cautious if I were management to give him the big deal unless he is able to stay healthy and contribute.
BlueJackets,3cojvt,andrewdt10,2,Thu Jul 9 17:19:40 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. He's shown in flashes that he can be worth 4-5 AAV, but his (lack of) durability is a big risk"

I worry about moving Tyutin though, how would Bob do without any other Russians on the team?"
BlueJackets,3cojvt,secretpenguin,6,Thu Jul 9 15:42:37 2015 UTC,He has endless hugs from Foligno. He'll probably be okay.

BlueJackets,3cojvt,overcatastrophe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:42:40 2015 UTC,I'd say that is very likely. You can expect Murray and Savard to sign some decent size deals and for Tyutin/Johnson to eventually be moved so that the younger guys can play. But when they'll be moved is a mystery. Tyutin could certainly get traded before Johnson because of his age and if a team wants him for a cup run or whatever.

We got rid of Wiz, but we also have hidden talents in Connauton and Goloubef. I have doubts about our current crop of defensemen and would love to see an addition of a veteran blueliner."
BlueJackets,3chuk1,SomeKindOfMonster,3,Wed Jul 8 01:05:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's all about Murray. If he's well, he's out #1 and everyone else can slide one spot down in their level of responsibility... Down to where they actually belong."

BlueJackets,3chuk1,andrewdt10,5,Wed Jul 8 23:14:32 2015 UTC,"Murray, Savard, Tyutin, and JJ are locks. The other 2-3 are any combination of Golo, Prout, Connauton, Paliotta, Falk, Heatherington, Kukan, and Madaisky. Of course the first 3 I listed are the favorites but I think Paliotta will make a really strong case to be on the team."
BlueJackets,3chuk1,WannabeFinn,2,Wed Jul 8 01:06:13 2015 UTC,Paliotta apparently looked decent in his one Blackhawks game. Hopefully he fast tracks to his potential.
BlueJackets,3chuk1,GeekYogurt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:28:30 2015 UTC,"He was heralded as a physical, defensive defenseman going into his draft. In his final two seasons of NCAA hockey he scored 63 points in 79 games.  He's a guy who already was sound in his own zone and played with an edge and he's developed his offensive game quite nicely. He's definitely capable of making the roster. It's just a matter of when."
BlueJackets,3chuk1,WannabeFinn,3,Wed Jul 8 03:52:52 2015 UTC,Could be better. Good enough to get us in the playoffs. Probably not enough to go deep. But you never know which guys are improving and which ones have plateaued.

Most likely paired with Tyutin, I think our top two D lines will be very strong assuming Murray stays healthy.

I think we'll be pretty solid on defense this year though!"
BlueJackets,3chuk1,nananiel,2,Wed Jul 8 14:33:28 2015 UTC,"I expect to see Savard have a monster year, and really start developing his Defensive game a little bit more especially if he gets to play with a healthy Murray all year."
BlueJackets,3chuk1,Swabeky,2,Wed Jul 8 15:21:27 2015 UTC,"Murray, Johnson, Tyutin, and Savard should be locks to make the team at training camp. I'd expect Goloubef to be the next guy in line with Connauton, Prout, Palliota, Heatherington, Madaisky, Falk, etc. all fighting for the 6-8 D spots.  Honestly, I think we'll see pairs like this:  Johnson - Savard  Murray - Goloubef  Tyutin - Prout/Connauton  I think Heatherington, Palliota, Madaisky, Falk, etc. will be the top 4 in Lake Erie and I imagine any of those four would be good call-ups, if need be.  edit: If we decide to keep 8 D on the roster, I'd expect Falk to probably get that spot so the others can get much needed playing reps in Lake Erie."

BlueJackets,3cfiou,SomeKindOfMonster,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:44:17 2015 UTC,I would guess 2.3 AAV. Its a significant raise over last season but won't break the bank by any means. I'm happy they avoided arbitration. That's always very messy.
BlueJackets,3cfiou,Logosmonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:45:25 2015 UTC,Somewhere around there. Which according to Hockeyscap.com that'll leave us with about 3mil in cap space.

Sergei Bobrovsky is our goalie and #1 in our hearts. Hard worker and has a lot of heart. Nick Foligno is our recently appointed captain after not having one for ~3 years. Brandon Saad hasn't played a game for us yet as we just recently aquired him from CHI, however he will likely be a huge part of our team's future. I could go on, as almost all of our players are super important to us but I'm sure you'll figure out the rest in time. :)    Important team history    Right now we don't have much history. Personally I see that as a positive as that gives me a chance to become a part of history in the making. We've only made the playoffs twice in the 15 years we have existed. Two season ago we got our first playoff win vs our rivals in Pittsburgh.     Generally interesting things about your team    We have a cannon! (Much louder in person.) That gets fired at the start of every game, after every goal, and after every win. The Hug    Info about your sub    Usually a quiet sub but with a strong community of regularly contributing members.

Whatever else you'd like to include    CBJ fans still don't know how they feel about Rick Nash Jeff Carter is a poo head This team almost made the playoffs this past season despite an egregious amount of injuries.

BlueJackets,3cfglf,HermanBonJovi,2,Tue Jul 7 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"20% skill, 2% luck, 78% heart   These types of comments are really starting to bother me. Joey, Foligno, Saad, Boone, Dubi, Cam, Hartnell, Murray, and Bob are all examples of very talented players - some with more grit to their game than others, but all possessing real NHL talent. It feels as if they're being stripped of their skill just to fit this identity that we created years ago to shed the bullshit that was Jeff Carter, and skill has almost become taboo to a section of the fan base. It's a slap in the face to the players to basically say they're not as skilled as other guys in the league.   Expectations are high going into this year not because we have a lot of heart - we had a lot of heart in the early 2000s, and expectations were non-existent - but because we have a LOT of talent. The narrative of us being the scrappy underdog needs to go away - we're a damn talented team, and talent is ultimately going to be what gets us the success we all want."
BlueJackets,3cfglf,justthetip751,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:34:37 2015 UTC,"That's not saying that the team is unskilled, just that they have so much heart."
BlueJackets,3cfglf,AnOldVillain,3,Wed Jul 8 12:25:33 2015 UTC,"The majority of hockey players have heart. The fan base has let Jeff Carter coasting ruin their perception of the majority of hockey players. That's just the way the game is. Yes there are teams here and there that quit, but the majority of players/teams bust their asses night after night and give similar effort to us - it doesn't make us unique, it doesn't make us special, it means the players are doing what is expected of them. As we advance farther and farther into the playoffs, it's not like our effort is going to exceed whoever we're playing. Effort on both sides will be the same, and talent will ultimately win."
BlueJackets,3cfglf,burnie08,3,Wed Jul 8 14:06:45 2015 UTC,Yes.
BlueJackets,3cfglf,AnOldVillain,3,Tue Jul 7 17:32:00 2015 UTC,"One thing that Idk if it's been mentioned: Fuck Mike Reilly. But overall, good choice with us :). A lot of great people in this sub too. It's hands down my favorite. So welcome. And enjoy"
BlueJackets,3caxpc,manandaduck,21,Mon Jul 6 14:12:07 2015 UTC,This has to be the best team we've ever had on paper. That was probably already true before we went out and grabbed Saad. Who doesn't get giddy thinking about it?
BlueJackets,3caxpc,GeekYogurt,2,Mon Jul 6 14:43:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and last season was the previous best team we've ever had, on paper. My thinking is that it is highly unlikely (not impossible, but damn close to it) that we suffer the injury bug anywhere near as badly as we did last season. If we lose only half as many man games to injury as we did last season we should be in the playoffs. If e miss a normal number then we should be a contender for the division."
BlueJackets,3caxpc,notwhoithink,8,Mon Jul 6 17:52:48 2015 UTC,So the two subs I spend the most time in are probably /r/CFB and /r/hockey. Seeing everyone love Columbus in /r/hockey while being the villain in /r/CFB is really hilarious to me.

BlueJackets,3caxpc,yankeesfan13,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:08:18 2015 UTC,True. And the momentum we built at the end of last year will hopefully stop us from having another slow start like we've had for the past 2 years

BlueJackets,3caxpc,Man_Bear_Pig08,2,Mon Jul 6 15:22:39 2015 UTC,Mcdavid will have an entry level deal so he wont get a mega deal for a few years
BlueJackets,3caxpc,Man_Bear_Pig08,2,Mon Jul 6 15:23:10 2015 UTC,"And not getting mega $ =/= not playing with the big club, or did I miss your point?"
BlueJackets,3caxpc,bucki_fan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:02:47 2015 UTC,"No he'll be with the big club, first year players get tiny entry level contracts so he wouldnt have been a big cap hit for 3 years. But its all a moot point, we won 20 in a row once we were out of contention to assure we didnt get a good shot at the lottery. Not that a 20 game win streak is something to be upset about. I just really wanted Mcdavid haha"
BlueJackets,3caxpc,Man_Bear_Pig08,2,Mon Jul 6 16:19:45 2015 UTC,"or hannifin    Eh, I don't think the potential difference between Hanifin and Werenski is that dramatic. It would have been nice to have a McDavid/Eichel, but I think we'll be fine. I'd almost rather have the team find that winning feeling and be hungry for this year than tank."
BlueJackets,3caxpc,Drithyin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:34:53 2015 UTC,The only difference is hannifin is older and ready to play now. Werenski is close to as good as hannifin and much younger so you could argue he has more potential but teams that need a guy whos ready now cant wait 2 years for werenski
BlueJackets,3caxpc,Man_Bear_Pig08,0,Mon Jul 6 20:49:28 2015 UTC,"I hear you there. Im SOOOOO glad we didnt take prokarov. No more filatov/zherdev BS! Werenski has SOO much potential. But yea, Mcdavid or eichel were a very real possibility in january. So I was happy for the team winning but it hurt to watch us lose a shot at a potential superstar when we were already out of playoff contention"
BlueJackets,3caxpc,Man_Bear_Pig08,2,Mon Jul 6 16:42:29 2015 UTC,Provorov has played hockey in Canada since the age of 14 I believe. I don't think he'll turn out like Filatov
BlueJackets,3caxpc,NLP19,2,Mon Jul 6 17:57:38 2015 UTC,"Alleging Provorov is the same as Filatov or Zherdev just because he's Russian is mighty racist xenophobic of you. We have had several excellent Russians on our team (and continue to lean heavily on them now, like Bobrovsky and Tyutin). Provorov has been playing for the Brandon Wheat Kings in the WHL, too, so there's no ""will-he-won't-he"" question about retreating to the KHL. He's played North-American style hockey thus far, so the transition to narrow ice is non-existent, too.   I'd have been happy with either Werenski or Provorov. It sounds like Jarmo/JD/scouts had their eye on Werenski from the outset (or said that publicly, at least), so I'm plenty happy with him coming to us."
BlueJackets,3caxpc,Drithyin,0,Mon Jul 6 17:11:25 2015 UTC,Russian is a nationality not a race. So it would be nationalist of me and sure we've had plenty of good Russian players but we've also had our fair share of specifically high profile draft pick Russians take a shit on us at the first sign of trouble. I bet if werenski had waited another year to enter the draft he would be top 3 so I couldnt be happier unless we had gotten mcdavid or eichel

BlueJackets,3cbke5,UrinalPies,5,Mon Jul 6 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"Should have bought him out when we had the chance or instead of throwing in Morin and Tropp in the Saad trade, should have thrown in Boll."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,CBJFAN10,12,Mon Jul 6 19:36:47 2015 UTC,Getting rid of Tropp was lucky enough. There's no way in the world Chicago would have taken Boll given their cap situation.
BlueJackets,3cbke5,UrinalPies,3,Mon Jul 6 19:42:26 2015 UTC,"If we don't need a Boll, you know they don't."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,TheZiggurat614,8,Mon Jul 6 21:31:27 2015 UTC,Buying out Boll doesn't really make sense tbh. Burying him in the minors would save us roughly the same amount of money and we'd have him off the books in half the time.

BlueJackets,3cbke5,Swabeky,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:56:58 2015 UTC,"He's not on a two-way contract, I imagine.  How would putting him in the minors save money?  (genuine curiosity)"
BlueJackets,3cbke5,phaqueNaiyem,2,Tue Jul 7 03:44:07 2015 UTC,"When you send a player on a one way contract to the AHL you get the NHL's minimum salary + an additional $375,000 in cap relief. For next season the minimum salary is 575k so the amount of cap relief you can get is 950k. That would mean putting Boll in the AHL reduces his 1.7m cap hit by 950k, putting it at 750k of ""dead"" cap space. It'd be a much better option than buying him out in terms of managing the cap."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,WannabeFinn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:51:31 2015 UTC,"And if we put him on waivers, maybe someone will be stupid enough to claim him!  That's a big maybe but eh whatever."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,THECapedCaper,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:24:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  But even if this strategy increases cap space, it doesn't reduce actual costs, which seem to be the team's primary concern."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,phaqueNaiyem,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:49:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it doesn't reduce actual money spent but I think the owners would rather spend that extra million over the long term (as opposed to a buyout) if it means the team is more competitive."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,WannabeFinn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:03:02 2015 UTC,"Of course, keeping Boll within reach of the lineup probably makes the team less competitive, but nevermind that...  It might help the team sell more tickets, though."

BlueJackets,3cbke5,TheZiggurat614,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:30:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, for some reason I thought it was over after this year.  Nevertheless, his contract isn't great, but it is by no means going to strangle us in a few years. I'm sure he'd be easier to move than Clarkson or Bourque if needed. He's always under scrutiny by the fans, and he goes out and bangs bodies and plays rock'em sock'em every 4-5 games with the biggest boys in the league. Or he's in the press box because he's not that great, and that takes it's toll on the body and the mind.   He's overpaid, yes, but he's sticking around there for a reason."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,Noler61,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:10:15 2015 UTC,"For a team with an internal cap, wasting 1.7 million dollars on a player that does not help win hockey games is debilitating."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,UrinalPies,3,Tue Jul 7 01:22:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty easy to see that ownership, management and the coaching staff want Boll around.  I assume at some point he might get sent down if he can't play any longer, but it seems clear that there's a role for him in the organization and just maybe someone thinks he's earned it. It amazing how much fans shit on the guy when he's done nothing but be a good teammate, an ambassador for the organization and a good citizen."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,CBJFan,5,Tue Jul 7 02:44:39 2015 UTC,I imagine he's got a job with the organization once that contract expires.

Boll personally?  Nothing bad to say about him.  His performance on the ice?  Should be better."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,Ohm_My_God,0,Tue Jul 7 11:51:17 2015 UTC,"It definitely isn't great for the winning, but some people really do like watching him fight. Hoping they bring up Anderson to fill in his spot soon.   He'll be on his way out in a few years, I'm sure. He may even be spending time in Lake Erie beating the snot out of some kiddies."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,Noler61,9,Tue Jul 7 02:41:18 2015 UTC,"The clarkson-horton deal had more to do with paying a guy who couldn't play vs paying a guy who could play. The cash is more or less the same. The only benefit to keeping Horton would have been cap relief if they put him on LTIR and spent to the cap. However, they would then be spending the cap + Horton salary in actual cash so it was unlikely to ever happen."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,CBJFan,6,Mon Jul 6 18:47:28 2015 UTC,FWIW - a decent replacement of CapGeek:  http://www.generalfanager.com/teams/columbus-blue-jackets
BlueJackets,3cbke5,GeekYogurt,2,Mon Jul 6 19:20:27 2015 UTC,"The move was made because we don't have the extra money to throw around like Toronto does.  Sure Horton wouldn't have counted against the cap, but it doesn't matter because we don't have that extra money to spend.  Clarkson is someone who can play for that money, rather than wasting it."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,namcon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:25:24 2015 UTC,"Horton does not count against the cap if he's in LTIR. Guess that means you cannot buy him out then either, while that could be possible with Clarkson's contract. But let's give him a chance to play now and hope he can fit in and contribute."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,Lahtelainen,3,Mon Jul 6 18:03:18 2015 UTC,"Clarkson's contract is mostly signing bonuses so it is essentially unable to bought out, IIRC."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,UrinalPies,2,Mon Jul 6 18:29:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. His actually salary is only like $1-2 mil or something, so buying him out saves between 500K-1.5M. Fucking Toronto brass, man."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,jpsquill,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:15:00 2015 UTC,"It's just a giant combination of things that made it so we're stuck with him, which is beyond frustrating. Just a TON of bad luck and coincidences and stupidity on both sides."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,UrinalPies,3,Tue Jul 7 00:27:38 2015 UTC,Who knows. Maybe he becomes a solid contributor on our team. He was solid before getting to Toronto...
BlueJackets,3cbke5,notwhoithink,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:32:49 2015 UTC,"Even though Horton doesn't count against the real salary cap, we would have to be paying him anyway. The internal cap is just the $ that management is letting Jarmo play with. We traded for Clarkson so that 7-digit salary was at least being used on the ice. Clarkson is actually slightly cheaper too... and you also would need to account for Horton's non-Clarkson replacement who would have at least a league minimum $500k (making broken Horton that much more expensive)."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,GeekYogurt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it sounds like he's getting as much money as the cap will allow"
BlueJackets,3cbke5,GeekYogurt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"He's getting what his contract was for...   It's true this was a bad move if you have unlimited internal funds (ahem, Toronto). But we don't. So we make lemonaid out of lemons that will be in water bottles protected by the water bottle police."

BlueJackets,3cbke5,notwhoithink,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:32:08 2015 UTC,"if you subtract the contracts that went the other way, the Saad deal doesn't really represent much of an increase in spending for the next 1-2 seasons."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,GeekYogurt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:46:33 2015 UTC,"Indeed, we're about $4 million shy from the actual cap with Calvert yet to extend."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,SovietShooter,0,Tue Jul 7 13:34:05 2015 UTC,"Right. And if that's the case, the Horton trade just doesn't make sense to me. If we have an internal cap that is lower, sure, let's get a third liner instead of a guy chilling on the Miami breaches. But from everything I'm seeing, the internal is the actual like you said"
BlueJackets,3cbke5,Lyun,5,Mon Jul 6 17:38:32 2015 UTC,"Well, but to illustrate the point (inexact numbers)... if the leafs are at the cap (71.4) and they are paying Horton 7 million dollars, that 78.4 million. Just because Jarmo is bringing us up to the cap doesn't mean he's allowed to spend 78.4 million."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,notwhoithink,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:47:56 2015 UTC,"Right. And if that's the case, the Horton trade just doesn't make sense to me. If we have an internal cap that is lower, sure, let's get a third liner instead of a guy chilling on the Miami breaches. But from everything I'm seeing, the internal is the actual like you said   I don't think anyone has really explained this well...   Horton's contract wasn't insured, so CBJ was going to have to pay it.  So essentially, however much money that was available for Jarmo, subtract Horton's $7M from that, as that had to be paid out to Horton even if he didn't play.   So, what Jarmo did was trade Horton's salary for Clarkson's, which puts the $7M back in play on the ice."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,Blahblag12321,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:41:50 2015 UTC,"Something that worries me about next year is how many contracts expire. We have around $6M left in space, and need to re-sign Calvert and Skille. Let's assume for theory's sake that they each take $1M contracts, even if that's not entirely realistic. We now have $4M. Expiring next year are:  Rene Bourque  Boone Jenner  David Savard  Dalton Prout  Ryan Murray  Kevin Connauton  Justin Falk  I think it's safe to say that we can part ways with Bourque and Falk. That frees up $4M right there, or at least really close to it. So we now have $8M left to re-sign Jenner, Savard, Prout, Murray and Goloubef. How do we afford that? I don't know that we can, and I could see Prout being let go unless he really steps up this season. Murray's gonna either get a bridge contract or big bucks, since management sees him as our future number one guy for the blue line. Savard is gonna want to cash in as well. Jenner's likely in the same situation as Murray. Connauton is a wild card in my eyes in terms of salary and whatnot, but you would have to assume that in order to keep him along with Jenner, Savard and Murray, that he's going to be taking a low AAV contract.  Fortunately though, out core guys are all locked up for a good few years. Guys like Dubi, Nicky Fligs, Saad, and Fartsmell won't be going until 2019 at the earliest amongst them. Unfortunately, Davey Clarkman's also here until 2021. Best case scenario, he somehow regains his lost form and becomes as solid as that one time in New Jersey. Worst case, we've got a $5M fourth-liner."
BlueJackets,3cbke5,Lyun,3,Tue Jul 7 03:48:56 2015 UTC,"Skille isn't coming back this season. The cap will go up again next season. Bourque, Falk, and Prout will likely be gone after this season. There are still trades to be made."

BlueJackets,3c8crt,Ass_Dragon,7,Sun Jul 5 21:18:33 2015 UTC,Can someone ELI5 what arbitration is and why Calvert was even suspected of filing it?
BlueJackets,3c8crt,xam2y,10,Mon Jul 6 01:30:41 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, when a player and team can't come to an agreement on salary, the player or the team can elect for arbitration and an independent party, the arbiter, will come in and make the decision for them based on evidence provided by both sides.   The whole process is typically bad for the relationship between the player and team because the team has to prove why they don't deserve a big contract right to the player's face.  Since today was the deadline for filing for arbitration, and Calvert didn't file, it suggests that he and the team are working towards a deal."
BlueJackets,3c8crt,xam2y,3,Mon Jul 6 01:46:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation. But isn't that the agent's job to negotiate the salary for the player? Does arbitration mean the agent failed, or does the agent elect to bring the netogiation to arbitration?"
BlueJackets,3c8crt,xam2y,7,Mon Jul 6 01:52:35 2015 UTC,"It is the agent's job to negotiate, but it's ultimately the player's decision whether he believes he is getting a good deal. If they are too far apart on numbers, the player can use this as a tool to try to get a better (for the player) contract.   It's also worth pointing out that this process is only used for Restricted Free Agents (RFAs). An Unrestricted Free Agent could just hit the open market if they don't believe they're getting a fair deal.   Edit: Also, the player has to have 4 years NHL experience (less if they sign after the age of 20) to be eligible. That's why we didn't see it with Johansen."

BlueJackets,3c2aa3,HermanBonJovi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:17:11 2015 UTC,"Panthers fan who lives in Chicago (I can't figure it out, either). I think the stance taken by Rosenbloom--one I've seen echoed by a handful of A.K. (After Kane) Blackhawks fans--is merely a defense mechanism intended to help overlook the fact that Stan Bowman wasted a considerable amount of time between the championship parade and free agency seeking an absolute king's ransom in return for Patrick Sharp and, to a much lesser degree, Bryan Bickell; once the offer sheet scenario became real in Bowman Jr.'s mind, he hit the ejector button and got what he thought was decent compensation for Saad. That could wind up being a fair deal for the Hawks, but it's hard to say they came out on top of a transaction in which they dealt an upper echelon power forward simply because he wanted to make a little more than half of what Toews and Kane each pull in annually. Instead, the Blue Jackets get a 22-year-old wunderkind with excellent speed and clutch scoring ability."

Sorry that the NHL and NHLPA agreed on that so there can be greater parity in the league and you're still not over it.    He really hasn't done his homework if he's calling the Blue Jackets a prison sentence.  We narrowly missed the playoffs after being decimated from injury last season as it is clearly shown here and then took the top wild card the year before.  I have a hard time believing that anyone can argue against any team in the NHL being on a bigger up-swing than the CBJ right now.  Let's also not forget that, while we do not have a great historical track record against the Blackhawks (Feb. 18, 2011 our last win prior to last season), we beat them both times we saw them last year, once in a shootout and once in regulation 5-2.  ...That's the end of my little rant on that.

BlueJackets,3bzz4s,redbluegreenyellow,4,Fri Jul 3 19:23:11 2015 UTC,"Brandon Saad will get his money from the Blue Jackets, and he‚Äôd better enjoy it because he just got buried.  I could be wrong, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that Blackhawks general manager Stan Bowman consigned the young, talented, money-hunting winger to one of the NHL‚Äôs maximum security prisons.  This seems as much a trade as a sentence. That‚Äôs my theory, and I‚Äôm sticking to it.  Brandon Saad 'a little shocked'  The trade is a forced combination of the price of winning Stanley Cups and the asphyxiating salary cap demanded   The destination, however, might be a ‚Äúback at ya.‚Äô‚Äô At least, that‚Äôs the way I look at some secondary aspects of what took place Tuesday.  Again, I could be wrong, but Bowman not only changed on the fly when Saad‚Äôs side reportedly demanded $6 million a year, but he also seemed to send a message to other players who want to take a hard stance in negotiations. You can collect your jackpot in hockey‚Äôs hinterlands.  Such moves aren‚Äôt new in the NHL -- all sports, actually. Teams have tried to punish players this way for years.  It‚Äôs why Buffalo, Winnipeg and Edmonton have existed in the NHL. It‚Äôs why Oakland and Jacksonville exist in the NFL. It‚Äôs why Sacramento and Philadelphia exist in the NBA. It‚Äôs why Cleveland exists, period.  Players who acted badly have been threatened with trades to dogbreath franchises in dogbreath cities. Coaches can establish their power by determining playing time; GMs can make a point by trading a player into oblivion.  Brandon Saad 'a little shocked' by trade from Blackhawks Saad admitted Wednesday he was ‚Äúa little shocked‚Äô‚Äô by the trade. Other reports said he was ‚Äúcrushed.‚Äô‚Äô Maybe that sentiment underscores my theory, maybe not. Maybe Saad still would‚Äôve been shocked if he had been traded to, I don‚Äôt know, Toronto or New York. But Columbus makes this seem a little more impactful to me.  You can play rough in the corners, but the Hawks might play it, too, and few things are rougher than comparing Columbus to Chicago as hockey franchises and hockey towns.  cComments @Phil Kober What are you so upset about? Q-STACHE AT 3:49 PM JULY 03, 2015 ADD A COMMENTSEE ALL COMMENTS 80 That certainly wasn't Bowman‚Äôs motive, but I can‚Äôt believe the swiftness with which he moved once he heard Saad‚Äôs demands and the destination to which he moved the player was an accident. Bowman is not an idiot. Neither is his father. One trade can multi-task.  The Hawks extracted some potentially useful players from the Jackets, starting with Artem Anisimov, a second- or third-line center, and Marko Dano, a 20-year-old former first-round pick.  Money issues force Blackhawks' hand in trading Brandon Saad But I have a hard time believing the Jackets were the only team with both the salary cap room to meet Saad‚Äôs demands and return the pieces the Hawks wanted. When a young talent such as Saad comes up for bid, I have to think other teams could‚Äôve moved some bodies and money to enter the conversation.  But even if I‚Äôm wrong, even if the Jackets were the only trade partner, and even if Bowman didn‚Äôt intent to send a message to players who want money more than Stanley Cups, this deal still makes that point. This might give other players some pause. Almost nobody turns down all the money available, but it might cost you a regular shot at rings.  The Hawks will see Saad when the regular season calls for it. Saad likely will spend the spring watching his former teammates defend the title he helped win."

BlueJackets,3bwgyv,NLP19,5,Thu Jul 2 19:37:06 2015 UTC,"The down votes are likely because of this:  Doesn't want to leave Chicago ‚â† Doesn't want to be in Columbus  When Trades happen, it's not common to see the player leaving actually glad to be doing so.  But, they're also usually happy to be going where they end up.  Those two things can be mutually exclusive, and likely in this case they are.

Would make no sense to take less now if a team wants to sign him to an offer sheet"
BlueJackets,3bwgyv,ChrisAshtear,3,Thu Jul 2 19:47:32 2015 UTC,"There won't be any offer sheets this time. We talk about them like the boogeyman, as if there's an offer sheet hiding behind every rock and tree waiting to tempt our RFAs, but the reality is that the last time an offer sheet was signed was in 2013. There have only been 8 offer sheets signed in the last decade, and of those only one of them was accepted. The rest were matched. With the CBJ having given up a very solid package of  assets to get Saad's rights, there's no way that they wouldn't match. Other teams know this, and if they didn't JK came out and said publicly that they would match, and we have the cap space to do it.  There is literally no point in any team even trying to tender an offer sheet to Saad, the only thing that they would be accomplishing is pissing off JK and JD, who they may have to negotiate a trade with one day."
BlueJackets,3bwgyv,notwhoithink,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but it is still beneficial for his agent to wait and see regardless, it changes nothing on anyone's end if it takes an extra week to finalize the deal."

He's one of those real team player who will do anything for the crest he wears and the people he plays with. He's not afraid to drop the gloves. He's been decent defensively and is good at face-offs. We loved him while he was here, but the past year, his play dropped off and he became kind of a scapegoat because of Claude Julien's obsession with playing him when he has no business being on the ice. So on the negative, he's not a particularly good skater, he won't help much with offense, and is a negative possession player. He's on the decline at this point, but he has the heart of a lion. Good luck in Lumbus, Soupy. Take care of him!"

BlueJackets,3bt024,WannabeFinn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:20:03 2015 UTC,sounds like $1.5m x 2 years
BlueJackets,3bt024,topcopontheforce,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:19:45 2015 UTC,"Well, he's a downgrade on Letestu statistically, but probably functional enough."
BlueJackets,3bt024,topcopontheforce,3,Wed Jul 1 22:39:19 2015 UTC,Give/take -- CBJ likely didn't want to go 3 years with Mark as that 4C will likely look much different by then.  I don't blame either side for not wanting to do the deal.
BlueJackets,3bt024,SomeKindOfMonster,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:46:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, true enough. I don't get what makes the difference between two years and three for this, tbh. Who are they expecting to be ready after two seasons? Chaput?"
BlueJackets,3bt024,NotMittRomney,3,Wed Jul 1 22:47:36 2015 UTC,"Chaput, Wild Bill, another unnamed asset yet to be acquired.  2 years is an eternity in hockey, so this should fill the immediate need when Columbus had been caught shorthanded on the bottom 6 last season."
BlueJackets,3bt024,TheZiggurat614,8,Wed Jul 1 22:49:57 2015 UTC,2 years is an eternity in hockey   So is the offseason
BlueJackets,3bt024,Logosmonkey,3,Wed Jul 1 22:59:40 2015 UTC,"Also, Stenlund looks like he could be an awesome 4C, granted that two years might be a bit too soon."
BlueJackets,3bt024,AnOldVillain,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:02:58 2015 UTC,"Yup, no reason to lock that spot down with this many prospects on the verge."
BlueJackets,3bt024,Man_Bear_Pig08,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:43:00 2015 UTC,He should be a fine 4C for the next couple of seasons. Seems like he is a serious heart guy.
BlueJackets,3bt024,habituallysuspect,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:37:27 2015 UTC,"Obviously the guy isn't a world beater, definitely a bottom 6 player. This teams 4th line center I assume. Part of a dying breed is the cliche....undertalented with heart and grit, as has been said previously.  Beyong being the guy who will get in front of a slapper, and slum in the corners, he's adequate on faceoffs which is something Wennberg can improve.  Snagging him short term on the cheap to fill the gap until someone else is ready, makes sense to me."
BlueJackets,3bt024,xam2y,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:44:13 2015 UTC,This seems to be a matter of depth. We had 9999999999999 injuries last year. So even an older grinder like this guy could come in very handy.
BlueJackets,3bt024,topcopontheforce,0,Thu Jul 2 01:36:41 2015 UTC,I look at all of these moves and I see a whole lot of Bill scratches next year. Hold me.
BlueJackets,3bt024,xam2y,2,Thu Jul 2 00:34:40 2015 UTC,Jarmo should have packaged Boll into the Saad deal as a little extra something for Chicago.

BlueJackets,3bt024,flyerfanatic93,2,Thu Jul 2 04:02:44 2015 UTC,I know haha I bet that's what Jarmo was thinking when he put Tropp into the deal
BlueJackets,3bt024,habituallysuspect,2,Thu Jul 2 04:06:01 2015 UTC,"We should be trying to sneak Boll into all our trades, see who is paying attention."

BlueJackets,3bt024,UrinalPies,6,Thu Jul 2 02:01:18 2015 UTC,This guy will most certainly be on the roster as the 4th line center. We kind of didn't have one once Letestu signed with Edmonton.
BlueJackets,3bt024,highvoltorb,0,Wed Jul 1 22:17:27 2015 UTC,"Ah okay. I guess I was just looking at Dubi, joey, boone, and wennberg and thinking we were done."

BlueJackets,3bt1id,Lyun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:41:04 2015 UTC,I remember watching that game. That was the most hardcore thing ive seen in forever.  I hope he brings that kind of heart to the Jackets.
BlueJackets,3bt1id,HermanBonJovi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:43:12 2015 UTC,Being a hard core Bruins fan I would say that Soupy will bring some excitement to Nationwide arena.
BlueJackets,3bt1id,maineiac04631,0,Mon Jul 6 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"As admirable as it is to keep trying after getting injured, he really should have stayed down and let the refs blow the whistle.  Doesn't look like he was able to do much but wave his stick around after he got hurt and essentially turned a 5 on 4 penalty kill into a 5 on 3."
BlueJackets,3bt1id,OMGWTFROFLOL,5,Wed Jul 1 22:46:16 2015 UTC,The refs don't blow the play dead until the defending team gets the puck or unless a defending player is bleeding profusely.
BlueJackets,3bt1id,xam2y,4,Thu Jul 2 00:45:29 2015 UTC,"This.  Unless you're passed out on the ice from pain or bleeding, plays not stopping because you got hurt.  Unrelated: Why the Shelley hate in your flair :("

BlueJackets,3bt1id,AffenTittenGeil,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:19:03 2015 UTC,Reminds me of a baseball game pic where a stats bar at the bottom showed that the team won 15/16 games where they scored more than their opponents. I saw it somewhere on reddit
BlueJackets,3br85e,waffle_eaters,13,Wed Jul 1 14:30:35 2015 UTC,Why does my team have such a shitty twitter account
BlueJackets,3br85e,Coteup,5,Wed Jul 1 15:37:46 2015 UTC,"It's because the Penguins are super popular and have a recent pattern of winning. I think this means that they are more cautious about posting things that might compromise their brand.  CBJ, on the other hand, is trying to build itself as a fun franchise with a lot of optimism and excitement around it to compensate for a history of relative failure.   When Pittsburgh says ""We will come back stronger, faster, and WILL win!"" with their twitter, their fans go ""yes. YES. YESSSS! This is the reason I love this team.""  If our twitter tried that, we'd be like ""Well, friend, I do hope you are right this time, but there is such a thing as being a sore-winner, you know..."""
BlueJackets,3br85e,Rentington,20,Wed Jul 1 20:16:07 2015 UTC,No it's because we're better and the Penguins blow

BlueJackets,3bsm9v,VirtuaSaturn,4,Wed Jul 1 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"Howdy. I‚Äôm a 3rd year, half STH and have nothing but positive things to say about my experiences with the organization at NWA. Between our ticket rep, the regulars that work our favorite concession stands, and even our friendly usher‚Äîwho we regularly high-five after a goal‚Äîwe love feeling like part of the Blue Jackets‚Äô family. I used to live in Victorian Village and we‚Äôd walk to games pretty regularly, if you have that option also, it helps cut back on parking fees for sure.   I like your enthusiasm with regards to Columbus and I think being a devoted fan to the Jackets is a great approach to enriching your time here in this fine city of ours.   As far as ticket plans go, my wife and I constantly debate going full-season, but there‚Äôs always something that comes up where one or both of us can‚Äôt make a game and I have had little luck on the ticket exchange website. Also, I quite enjoy just sitting back at home and watching the game. Though, we do usually end up buying additional tickets because we feel like we‚Äôll miss something if we‚Äôre not in the arena.  Anyway, I fully endorse getting into a ticket plan, and depending on what you can afford it may make sense to go for the full package or dial it back and see what you think next year.. You can always up your package in the future."
BlueJackets,3bsm9v,logicoLe,2,Wed Jul 1 21:13:08 2015 UTC,"oh, that's a really good point. You really do develop relationships with the other ticket holders around you, your usher and the vendors. I've made a lot of new friends via my STH plan :)  The year before I was attending a ton of games but just buying single tickets and the difference is night and day when you know you'll be sitting by the same folks."
BlueJackets,3bsm9v,Logosmonkey,3,Wed Jul 1 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a STH, this is my second year. I seriously considered downgrading to a half season but ended up reupping my full season because I really enjoy the convenience of knowing I can go to any home game I want.  A few times a year I swap out my ticket for a pair or three when I want to go with my friends. My ticket rep always takes care of it and they always give me the cost of my ticket to the purchase. I think I get a discount of some sort, but it's not huge. A few % maybe?  I honestly don't sell my tickets that often but each time I have it's been quite easy with ticket exchange."
BlueJackets,3bsm9v,Logosmonkey,2,Wed Jul 1 20:51:57 2015 UTC,"I was a STH for the first three years of the franchise.  I loved every game I could make it to, and I loved the fact that I got to know the people that sat around us, because there were so many regulars in our section.  That's the positive.  Now for the negative...  Don't ignore the ancillary costs like parking and food.  This can quickly add up to another thousand or two on top of the ticket prices.   Just make sure that the total cost fits your budget expectations."
BlueJackets,3bsm9v,robaticus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:37:47 2015 UTC,"I am going on my 3rd season as a 1/4 season ticket holder. I have not attempted to sell my tickets but my ticket rep is available to help me with that. My ticket rep was very helpful throughout the whole all star game setup too. I thought as a season ticket holder that I would see the same people everytime I went, but that is never the case. I have club level seats which I love, but there really hasn't been the kind of seat neighbors I expected. Season ticket holders get invited to exclusive events and meet and greets, and you can usually count on getting some free tickets at some point in the season if you answer a survey of something. The only bad thing about having season tickets is that if the jackets are stinking it up, you are already committed and you have tickets. So you go, or you sell, or you eat them. I love going, so it usually issue, but last season i scheduled most of my games late in the season expecting another playoff push. That didn't work out, and I found myself kinda making myself go during the week sometimes when I may have preferred to just go to a bar and watch. The longer you are a season ticket holder, the better your chance of getting better seats. Something I don't like is the way you pick games as a 1/4 package holder is rather restrictive. 5 groups of games, pick like 2 from these groups, 3 from the others, plus you HAVE to go to a preseason game. 1/4 don't get any parking perks. As a season ticket holder, I like going to the arena and instead of having tickets printed to bring, they simply swipe your Jackets ticket credit card thing. Everytime I whip that out, it makes me feel slick. I think a 1/4 package is a good start if you aren't sure you want to commit to a package. Also, we just picked our games and preselected seat options via web last week. So if you wanna sign up, now is the time, friend. all in all, going to a bunch of hockey games can only be a good thing. Hope any of this info helps. Go jackets!"
BlueJackets,3bsm9v,hitliquor,2,Wed Jul 1 23:25:59 2015 UTC,"1/4 don't get any parking perks.   Full STH here.  If it makes you feel any better the parking perks are a joke.  $1 off and you have to pay for the full season up front, which means you only have to miss a handful of games and it's not worth it."
BlueJackets,3bsm9v,namcon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:24:17 2015 UTC,We had the 6 game flex pack. I wish we could afford to upgrade. It's worth it. I have friends who are and I'm envious. Do it! (Peer pressure!)
BlueJackets,3bsm9v,nachomamasconcern,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:22:09 2015 UTC,I have been a full season holder for 3 years. I love it and the friends I have made. I trade in games to take friends. I will also sell some big name games occasionally to cut down on cost. Average ticket price is around 17 bucks where i sit. I can sell a penguin hame for around 80 to 90 a seat and Toronto for around 65. I then put that on the next seasin. The extra events are awesome too. There is a trip to the zoo that is fun. There is a clippers game too. It is more than just tickets to a game. I feel they respect the money we pay. There is also an autograph night.

BlueJackets,3brnl2,imbored343,3,Wed Jul 1 16:32:52 2015 UTC,I think we underestimate Letestu though. When we had Dmack and Comeau we we're able to run 4 lines and still impose our will on teams and tire them down. Letestu was the last guy we had left to keep 4 strong lines now we lose him and give the role to a rook. That's a huge blow to me. Not the end of the world but still more painful than people think.
BlueJackets,3brnl2,Back41DayOnly,0,Wed Jul 1 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he had his worst statistical season of his career last season and missed a bunch of games via being scratched. He wasn't making the impact he used to make with Blake and DMac."

I've never seen Prout sign like that (although I haven't seen that many signatures of him). He usually signs a lot more of his name than the initials.   Then again, I don't know who would fake that because I don't think it has that much value."
BlueJackets,3br9zh,stupidchange,5,Wed Jul 1 14:45:55 2015 UTC,"So, based on the salary range, here's who has the picks required to offer sheet Saad.  Go ahead, Pitt. Offer him 9m. We'll gladly take your next four lottery picks if you do.  Not much chance Chicago runs back at him, either.  Feeling a lot better after this."
BlueJackets,3br9zh,Drithyin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:47:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why offer sheets are so rare. If you offer a reasonable value contract, you make the negotiation with the team who owns the RFA rights easy, as they just match. If you overpay a ton and try to give Saad (or any RFA in a simlar position) Malkin-money, then you might get stuck with a massive cap hit burden and losing a ton of first round picks in the process.   Plus, if an RFA is actually worth Malkin money, the team who owns his rights would sign before UFA season or match automatically anyway."

BlueJackets,3bofag,TheDoubleL27,36,Tue Jun 30 21:14:47 2015 UTC,I mean I love Dano guys but this was a really good trade for us.
BlueJackets,3bofag,jpsquill,11,Tue Jun 30 21:23:58 2015 UTC,Exactly. Saad is a great LW who is going to be a stud for us.
BlueJackets,3bofag,WannabeFinn,25,Tue Jun 30 21:24:52 2015 UTC,Really good trade? We fleeced the fuck out of Chicago. I love this deal so much.
BlueJackets,3bofag,Stommped,9,Tue Jun 30 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"Fleeced I think is the incorrect word.  Chicago had no other options, they couldn't afford what he was asking and CBJ had to know that by the fact that they were willing to talk to them.  Easy to come out on top when your trade partner has no other options."
BlueJackets,3bofag,WannabeFinn,3,Tue Jun 30 22:10:30 2015 UTC,"Chicago still could have asked for things of value like 1st rounders, etc. in return rather than ""just"" Dano+Arty+a pile of junk. I'm admittedly a huge fan of Dano, and I think he and Arty will be good for the Hawks. They did get good players in return. I just think they could've got a lot more."
BlueJackets,3bofag,notwhoithink,6,Tue Jun 30 22:26:15 2015 UTC,"Chicago needed a center to replace Brad Richards, and Arty is a very affordable alternative who will service them well.  Dano is a great young talent.  He's only 20 years old, and in the 30-some games that he played this past season he put up numbers very comparable to what Saad did in his first half season when he was the same age.  There's nothing to say that after another year or two that Dano couldn't end up being as good as Saad, or even better.  Especially playing on a team like the Blackhawks.  But the big thing is that he's a heck of a lot cheaper for the next few years.  I wouldn't call Tropp and Morin junk.  They're not superstars, but they were definitely extra pieces for us clogging up the board.  I'd call both ""serviceable"" NHLers, probably on the 4th line.  But they're both young and cheap, which is what Chicago needs right now with all of their cap trouble.  If you'll recall, Morin actually came to us from Chicago, so they are definitely familiar with them.  All in all I think that it was a pretty fair trade.  We traded 4 players to clear a logjam that will hopefully allow us to re-sign Letestu, and we got back a very very young and probably first line winger in the deal who has already won two cups.  That's some very useful experience.  Chicago knew that they couldn't pay Saad what he was worth and avoided losing him on an offer sheet, while getting a serviceable center to replace the very expensive Brad Richards.  Chicago filled some holes and she did it without breaking the bank."
BlueJackets,3bofag,NotMittRomney,13,Wed Jul 1 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Absolutely phenomenal trade. Gotta give to get, but my god Saad is a phenomenal fit here and exactly the kind of high-end NHL-proven talent that we need at winger.  Love Dano, but we some great wingers knocking on the door. Sonny added 15+ pounds and is already possibly the most skilled and quickest winger in our organization. He's bigger than Dano now. Plus Bjorkstrand is coming off of an historic year.

BlueJackets,3bofag,Swabeky,8,Tue Jun 30 22:12:40 2015 UTC,Teams need players like Letestu and Calvert in the bottom 6 to win cups. I'm hopeful we can keep both.
BlueJackets,3bofag,buckeye_baker,8,Tue Jun 30 22:17:57 2015 UTC,Yep.  case in point DMack
BlueJackets,3bofag,NLP19,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:40:40 2015 UTC,So maybe a dumb question but he was set to be a free agent yeah? What's the length we get him for guaranteed?
BlueJackets,3bofag,jpsquill,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:31:53 2015 UTC,"He set to be an RFA, so teas can give him an offer sheet, and we have to match it, but I'm confident in Jarmo to get a deal done"
BlueJackets,3bofag,dieyoubastards,3,Tue Jun 30 21:36:36 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet a deal gets done within the next hour or so.
BlueJackets,3bofag,CantGetAGirlfriend,28,Tue Jun 30 21:39:18 2015 UTC,"You guys are in luck - Saad is an incredibly hardworking and overperforming player who /r/hawks is devastated to see go. I was going to get his name on a shirt.  This Dano chap had better be good.  EDIT: Saad is going to be a perfect fit with Columbus, I like your team and I think with this and everything else you lot are going to fuck shit up this season."
BlueJackets,3bofag,Ohm_My_God,7,Tue Jun 30 21:28:35 2015 UTC,I think you'll be impressed with Dano. We all thought he was gonna be a mainstay on the team for years to come...

BlueJackets,3bofag,el_karacho,2,Tue Jun 30 23:36:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that Dano could very well be a younger Saad from two seasons ago.  He's still only 20 and a bit smaller than Saad, but with some NHL seasoning he'll be just fine."
BlueJackets,3bofag,nine_eyed_spider,2,Wed Jul 1 00:02:52 2015 UTC,"Dano is a great player, he was starting to develop some great chemistry with Hartnell."

BlueJackets,3bofag,ScarletWitch65,3,Tue Jun 30 22:58:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Other than Foligno, Bobrovsky, and Johnson who should I know about?"
BlueJackets,3bofag,Ohm_My_God,6,Tue Jun 30 23:00:14 2015 UTC,"Johansen, he's the 1C Saad's going to be playing with. Really solid guy, not always the most mature for his age, but coming into his own well. Atkinson might be the other winger on that line, he is the literal tiniest (his listed height is 5'8"" but I have seen pictures of him next to Gerbe and they are at most an inch different) and is an amazing speedster.   Others to be familiar with: Dubinsky, Hartnell, Wennberg, Calvert. Everyone else is a bit of an uncertainty as to where things shake out, but those are safe bets. I've found following the various players on instagram is a pretty good way of getting to know them, so if that's your sort of thing here is Joey's (that's Johansen btw) and Cam's for a start."
BlueJackets,3bofag,xanbo,2,Tue Jun 30 23:22:16 2015 UTC,"Insta is definitely my sort of thing. I will check them out. Thank you!  ETA: if it is Atkinson, that will be a fun line because Saader is crazy fast as well."

BlueJackets,3bofag,NLP19,6,Tue Jun 30 21:13:31 2015 UTC,"Morin and Dano are both very young good, potentially great players who I'm definitely sad to see go."
BlueJackets,3bofag,HermanBonJovi,6,Tue Jun 30 21:30:43 2015 UTC,"I'm familiar with Morin as he was on the Hawks previously; the problem with him is that once a young forward slacks on defense like he did, Quenneville doesnt trust him anymore.    From what I have read the past few minutes, looks like Dano is the gem in this trade for Chicago. Apparently he impressed a lot of people in his 30ish NHL games. He could get time with some big names and hopefully that helps him along.    Anisimov sounds like a 2C or 3C which is a piece of need for Chicago since we'll likely be losing Richards and Vermette.     Tough day for Hawks fans, but have to trust the system! Enjoy Saad, he's so much fun to watch!"
BlueJackets,3bofag,NLP19,5,Tue Jun 30 21:42:50 2015 UTC,"Morin is not a ""potentially great"" player, there's no need to overrate him. It sucks losing Dano, but it's worth it adding Saad."

BlueJackets,3bofag,jpsquill,4,Tue Jun 30 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"Morin never did much of anything for us either. Does put him in a pretty awkward spot though, having publicly wanted out and then got thrown back in."

BlueJackets,3bofag,infiniteshadow,5,Tue Jun 30 21:29:56 2015 UTC,I am stoked for Brandon Saad being part of the team! It does hurt knowing Dano had to go in order to make the deal happen. I was wondering why my older brother (Hawks fan who lives in Chicago) kept blowing up my phone the last hour I was at work.  Good to know we cleared out some forward space and that talks with Letestu's camp sound like they are back on. Some Hawks fans also seem a little bummed that this Michael Paliotta guy got traded too because apparently he could easily be a Top-4 D in a year or two. At least Dano & Arty going to Chicago will give me an excuse to watch more Hawks games and root for them without getting ill.
BlueJackets,3bofag,jpsquill,5,Tue Jun 30 21:56:25 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you man, this trade gives me goosebumps. The big ones always seem to come out of nowhere like this."

BlueJackets,3bofag,schmidtzkrieg,2,Tue Jun 30 22:05:00 2015 UTC,"Could someone explain this to me:  Saad is an RFA next season, so he will go out looking for contracts. He's had a great season just like Ryan Johansen last year. Why would Jarmo be willing to sign Saad to a 6-year deal when he did not even give that to Johansen? Has Saad really proven his worth now more than Johansen did last year? And if Saad does sign such a giant deal, Johansen will be up in arms about his 2-3m per year bridge deal.  Furthermore, the pens could offer Saad a really good deal that Jarmo would have to match, lest he will have wasted a great prospect and Anisimov.  How does this deal make sense from this standpoint?"
BlueJackets,3bofag,IAmAChemicalEngineer,3,Tue Jun 30 22:05:49 2015 UTC,Sign both Saad and Johansen long term and our first line woes are hopefully over. A YOUNG first line would be incredible. He's an RFA yes but if we sign an extension that won't matter.
BlueJackets,3bofag,Lyun,2,Tue Jun 30 22:09:35 2015 UTC,"They are most likely negotiating an extension pretty much as we speak. Saad has been a success for three years now and deserves to get paid, which he will. Johansen knows he's going to get paid next time around too, so I wouldn't really worry about him being up in arms right now."

Aside from the Hawks, you guys are my favorite team in the NHL. So fun to watch, and you're going to wreck the Eastern Conference in the upcoming years."
BlueJackets,3bofag,WannabeFinn,2,Tue Jun 30 22:15:33 2015 UTC,Another Hawks fan here. You guys have a great team and now one more clutch player. Here's to Columbus Saadomizing the rest of the East.
BlueJackets,3bofag,RaynebowBryte,2,Tue Jun 30 22:29:07 2015 UTC,I'm proud for you CBros.  Kneel before Saad
BlueJackets,3bofag,TheDoubleL27,2,Wed Jul 1 01:14:54 2015 UTC,"Holy crap. I really like Dano, as well as Tropp and Arty Party... BUT OH WOW WE GOT SAAD.  THIS IS A SAAD DAY. A HAPPILY SAAD DAY."
BlueJackets,3bofag,nine_eyed_spider,2,Wed Jul 1 03:29:41 2015 UTC,Dano :(  Saad :)  Dano :(((((

BlueJackets,3bofag,Soviet17,2,Wed Jul 1 08:12:07 2015 UTC,Uhhhhhhhh.... What?  I miss Dano already.
BlueJackets,3bofag,jpsquill,2,Tue Jun 30 21:23:56 2015 UTC,"While I like this trade (really, I do!), we still haven't done much to address our largest concern on offense - right wing. I mean, we've already got Foligno, Calvert, Rychel, Hartnell, Milano, and even Rene fucking Borque on the left side. Hopefully we can turn that log-jam into a RW or two (not to mention the needs on D as well)."

BlueJackets,3bofag,Trench_77,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:14:16 2015 UTC,Where does he slot in? Does he take Duby's 2nd line spot? Or even Atkinson's?
BlueJackets,3bofag,Cornyk27,5,Tue Jun 30 21:19:02 2015 UTC,He should be playing next to Joey IMO.
BlueJackets,3bofag,highvoltorb,3,Tue Jun 30 21:21:06 2015 UTC,Saad - RyJo - Atkinson  Mmmmm
BlueJackets,3bofag,Swabeky,3,Tue Jun 30 21:22:59 2015 UTC,It's got hnnnngggg written all over it.
BlueJackets,3bofag,SaucyMittsChris,2,Tue Jun 30 21:33:00 2015 UTC,Well he's a winger so duby isn't relevant. He'll be playing first line with Joey and whomever. Would like to see Bjorkstrand there one day
BlueJackets,3bofag,jpsquill,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:37:42 2015 UTC,He played some LW towards the end of the year though didn't he?
BlueJackets,3bofag,wzabel0926,2,Tue Jun 30 21:25:36 2015 UTC,His injury changed some things. In reality though he's above 50% FO guy who more than likely will be at C next season.
BlueJackets,3bofag,buckeye_baker,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:42:28 2015 UTC,He was consistently top line for the cup championship team. With a coach known for constant mixing of lines. If he isnt first line than he isnt being utilized fully
BlueJackets,3bofag,yankeesfan13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:46:47 2015 UTC,I'd say top line. Atkinson would pair well with Foligno/Jenner and Dubinsky.

BlueJackets,3bofag,Pepsuber188,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:24:45 2015 UTC,"Next order of business is signing him to an extension. Sounds like he's looking for the 6-year, $6.5 mil range."
BlueJackets,3bofag,topcopontheforce,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:25:12 2015 UTC,What can you guys tell a Hawks fan about everyone we just got Saad for?
BlueJackets,3bofag,xanbo,5,Tue Jun 30 21:26:56 2015 UTC,"Dano is pretty fucking awesome, he'll be good for you guys. Go ahead and raise your Danos. Arty is good.. Morin we didn't see much of because he was on IR."
BlueJackets,3bofag,yankeesfan13,4,Tue Jun 30 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"Dano is a beast.   Anisimov is a decent player, probably a 3rd liner on an average team. The only issue is that he doesn't keep his head up and keeps getting hurt as a result.   The other 2 are 4th liners at best. Nothing to be excited about."
BlueJackets,3bofag,joeymckenna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:34:32 2015 UTC,"Well I know we had Morin last year and Q barely ever played him, so we'll see how that works out"
BlueJackets,3bofag,drinkbeerneverfear,2,Tue Jun 30 21:37:06 2015 UTC,Dano could either be a 3rd line pain in the ass or a first line stud sniper. Anisimov does a lot for the team in his game that people don't often realize because he's not a consistent scorer. Decent pickup for a team that's already loaded. That's really the only pieces that will probably have some sort of impact for you guys

BlueJackets,3bofag,kcbwya77,2,Tue Jun 30 21:31:15 2015 UTC,Yeah Dano is the gem of the trade on Chicago's end.  Definitely.

BlueJackets,3bohjc,hryhoriyy,21,Tue Jun 30 23:59:16 2015 UTC,"You motherfuckers. You have no idea the addition to your team. Get ready to fall in love with the Manchild.   Saad is YOUNG. He is ELITE. He earned a tremendous amount of respect from his already respectable (and successful) teammates. These guys know when they some gold, and they all spoke of Saad very highly. Toews said all the guys in the locker room thought of him as if he were in his 30s because of the way he carries himself. He is mature.   Offensively: he is a confident player in part thanks to his consistent playoff success. He will bring that ""winning attitude"" to your team. He's fucking FAST. I swear he scores shorthanded half as much as he scores at full strength - not to take away from his usual goals, he's got a shot - because he's so damn quick. Saad on a breakaway = $$$.   Defensively: uses his quickness to his advantage. He's a smart player, good at creating opportunities for himself. Definitely can hold his own.  For fucks sake guys he was a first liner on our Stanley Cup winning team at 22. After Toews Kane and Keith he was the most valuable player to the Hawks in my mind (considering the future).   Hope that was at least entertaining if not somewhat helpful to some of y'all. That was more for me to grieve over my loss as a Hawks fan. Enjoy him.   PS the new 3 on 3 overtime is straight money for Saad"

BlueJackets,3bohjc,buckeye_baker,6,Tue Jun 30 21:59:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, we'll be using him to his potential for sure. He'll be best of buddies with Johansen for a long time :)"

BlueJackets,3bohjc,hawks198810,3,Wed Jul 1 04:57:37 2015 UTC,"I really hope you CBJ can get him signed.  Saad will be a great piece for the core of your team.  As said in many other posts, this guy has tremendous upside.  Defensively he has gotten noticeably better over the last two season, back checking and PK work have become very good.  Often called a mini-Hossa.  Offensively, he has that ability to suddenly shift into another gear, blowing by defenders.  He is a power forward who is really becoming very good at taking the puck right to the net.  He is STRONG, like a fucking Bull.  He does not get taken off his skates very often and is a difficult player to push around.  Probably the biggest stats that you will not see is that he is a team guy, loved in the locker room, works hard, and he is patient, does not get frustrated, and mature for a 22YO.  He will be missed in Chicago, but he will be a very very good addition to CBJ.  I hope it works so well for CBJ that we get to see you in the SCF."

BlueJackets,3bohjc,ranatalus,19,Tue Jun 30 22:20:33 2015 UTC,"lol we won two cups with Brandon Saad as a core player, making great two-way plays and scoring clutch goals in important situations. Don't ever call that man a pigeon."

BlueJackets,3boi7l,xam2y,2,Tue Jun 30 21:42:01 2015 UTC,"Problem is that if Jarmo gives Saad his 6.5m x 6 year contract, that will effectively negate the cap hits of Anisimov, Dano, Morin, and Tropp. With the mystery internal salary cap Jarmo is dealing with, who knows what the max offer for LeTestTube is?"

BlueJackets,3bp3hf,WannabeFinn,5,Wed Jul 1 00:21:15 2015 UTC,"You're right, nobody should be overlooking him. Paliotta is a valuable piece."
BlueJackets,3bp3hf,Stupid_Sexy_Sharp,3,Wed Jul 1 02:29:21 2015 UTC,"Hawks fan here. Losing Saad hurt my heart, but losing Paliotta just confuses me considering how empty our defense is now. A lot of us were really excited about this kid and some were even calling for him during the Final. No idea how well he turns out, but the kid has serious potential."
BlueJackets,3bp3hf,HORSEtheGAME,2,Wed Jul 1 01:18:02 2015 UTC,"Some more info   A physical blueliner with good size and skating ability. Paliotta has been pegged as a shutdown defenseman in his draft year, but has proven to have an offensive side to his game as his college career has progressed. He has played a key role in the resurgence of the University of Vermont hockey program.   http://www.hockeysfuture.com/prospects/michael_paliotta/  http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?player=38626"

Sure we lost Dano but howson wouldve just grabbed a couple 38 yr olds with bad contracts to not make the roster. Jarmo gets value out of everything
BlueJackets,3bp3hf,OMGWTFROFLOL,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:01:06 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest here.  Jarmo has made some pretty questionable trades over the past few years, and most of our core players on the team were brought here by Howson."
BlueJackets,3bp3hf,JGreenberg11,2,Wed Jul 1 23:04:30 2015 UTC,Yeah... Most of those were his last second 'save my job' trades... A lot of our depth and success has been brought in by Jarmo. And I think the only questionable move he made was picking Dano at 27 and look how that turned out! Dude was a stud! Only thing I can think fans would have thought to be questionable was Hartnell for Umberger trade and I knew that was great from the start.
BlueJackets,3bp3hf,OMGWTFROFLOL,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:47:34 2015 UTC,"Okay, so here's the players each GM brought to the team:  Howson: Atkinson, Calvert, Dubinsky, Foligno, Jenner, Johansen, Goloubef, Johnson, Murray, Prout, Savard, Tyutin, Bobrovsky, McElhinney, Forsberg  Jarmo: Bourque, Campbell, Clarkson, Hartnell, Saad, Wennberg, Connauton, Falk  Of course Howson spent a lot more time here than Jarmo has yet but the point I'm trying to make is how little credit Howson gets for building the most of the team we have today.   Only thing I can think fans would have thought to be questionable was Hartnell for Umberger trade and I knew that was great from the start.   I'm assuming that you just completely wiped any memories of the Gaborik trades from your brain because I really hope you don't count that as one of the good trades Jarmo has made."
BlueJackets,3bp3hf,Man_Bear_Pig08,0,Fri Jul 3 18:58:44 2015 UTC,"What about Vorachek?? He would be rather nice to still have around no? How about Derrick brassard? Vermette? Stralman? Chimera?He also pissed of Rick Nash and made him want to leave, Remember him? He was pretty good...  Gaborik is an awesome player, just not here, if you watched the games he didnt fit our system. Thats why he BLEW UP in LA (even though I hate them)"
BlueJackets,3bp3hf,OMGWTFROFLOL,2,Fri Jul 3 19:56:22 2015 UTC,"Sure it'd be nice to have Voracek back but if Carter hadn't been a little bitch about it being traded it could've worked out pretty well for us.  People were even predicting we'd make the playoffs with Carter and Nash on our top line, but of course the season went completely to shit (I mostly blame Arniel for this) which ended up with Carter and Nash wanting out.  I'm not sure what you mean by Howson pissing Nash off and I've never heard anything of there being something personal between them.  Even though it sucks we had to trade them, compare the return of those two trades (Dubinsky, Anisimov, Erixon, Johnson, Rychel, and Dano) to what we threw Gaborik away to the Kings for instead of re-signing him.  As for Brassard, he was traded away by Jarmo, remember?"
BlueJackets,3bp3hf,Man_Bear_Pig08,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:09:49 2015 UTC,Nash had no Issue until Howsen mentioned The possibility of using him as a rebuilding tool to another GM and nash got wind. He then immediately wanted out. He had just signed a 7 yr deal and howson made him feel unappreciated.
BlueJackets,3bo15b,nunoveaux,4,Tue Jun 30 19:27:08 2015 UTC,The only fly in the ointment with this deal would be if the Jackets decide to deal for Dion Phaneuf

BlueJackets,3booax,HardKnockRiffe,2,Tue Jun 30 22:34:47 2015 UTC,well this makes me feel a lot better about the trade but it still wont be worth it if we cant develop dano

BlueJackets,3booax,HardKnockRiffe,2,Tue Jun 30 22:49:11 2015 UTC,I mean teams that can develop talent don't always develop every talented player that's not to say I predict any issues I'm just saying I'm a little cautious about my expectations from talented young players
BlueJackets,3booax,chunkymonkeychow,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:44:07 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but even our GM was upset to see Dano go. He was only included because it was necessary for him to be in the deal. The guy spent half a season in the AHL before getting the call and quickly became an every day guy, taking ice time away from NHL vets. He's pretty close to a can't-miss prospect."

BlueJackets,3booax,notwhoithink,5,Tue Jun 30 22:49:42 2015 UTC,If we had a healthy team he may have not played very much at all. He got his chance when the injury bug came around and stayed till the end. I imagine he would have played every game here next season.

""At some point we're probably going to have to part ways"" with [their] players. They've been looking for a left-shot left-wing to play with Joey specifically. ""That was not in our plans"" regarding submitting offer sheet for Saad if trade fell through. Says that pick-stockpiling was Jackets philosophy over the past three years to package for a player ""like Brandon Saad."" They have spoken to Saad and he ""seems excited"" about getting contract signed. He told Dano that it ""breaks [his] heart"" to put him in the deal. Says they will be happy with their current defense going into next season if they can't find a defenseman they like in FA, says they don't believe in ""making a splash"" unless it's for a player ""like Brandon.""

BlueJackets,3bl4lq,SomeKindOfMonster,2,Tue Jun 30 03:12:36 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, and as long as he signs with us eventually, we will be in good shape. Great job transcribing it all btw!"

BlueJackets,3bjzrt,topcopontheforce,3,Mon Jun 29 21:13:21 2015 UTC,People seem to forget about him and I think it's totally unfair. I've always seen him as one of the hardest working guys on the team.

BlueJackets,3bjzrt,CBJFan,4,Tue Jun 30 12:51:59 2015 UTC,Chaput has been awful in his time with CBJ but I'm excited for him to develop a bit more with Lake Erie. He was really thrown into a shitty situation in Columbus before he was ready for it. He should only be on the NHL roster if there are major injuries again.
BlueJackets,3bjzrt,UrinalPies,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:07:07 2015 UTC,Agreed. Why would we ever play him before Rychel?  Or what was that other big forward's name?  Both of them were better than him.

BlueJackets,3bjzrt,phaqueNaiyem,3,Tue Jun 30 03:13:40 2015 UTC,Chaput really impressed at camp last year. One of the reasons he had a longer look in the show.
BlueJackets,3bjzrt,GeekYogurt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:52:43 2015 UTC,Different position. Chaput is a center. He looked fine to me last year in his first extended action. The more he played the better he looked.  He's going to be the versatile 4th line center who can move up the lineup a little if needed sooner than later.
BlueJackets,3bjzrt,CBJFan,3,Tue Jun 30 12:51:01 2015 UTC,Shampoooooo!
BlueJackets,3bjzrt,NLP19,2,Mon Jun 29 21:29:44 2015 UTC,"i loved yelling that at NWA when he was on the ice. i get a lot of weird looks but hey, SHAMPPOOOOOOOOO!"
BlueJackets,3bjzrt,russbuss31,2,Tue Jun 30 13:25:50 2015 UTC,Good. Glad they extended a QO to Chaput too. I wanted him to stick around for a little while longer.
BlueJackets,3bjzrt,jpsquill,2,Mon Jun 29 21:09:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely, he provides some valuable center depth."
BlueJackets,3bjzrt,GeekYogurt,2,Mon Jun 29 21:11:42 2015 UTC,Chaput a good candidate for 4C if Letestu leaves.
BlueJackets,3bjzrt,andrewdt10,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:22:54 2015 UTC,It's looking more and more like Letestu will not be returning to the Blue Jackets next year.

BlueJackets,3bjzrt,andrewdt10,2,Mon Jun 29 21:35:08 2015 UTC,I agree. I think Chaput would be a good 4th line center. Letestu would have signed already.
BlueJackets,3bjzrt,THECapedCaper,2,Tue Jun 30 01:14:58 2015 UTC,"We would needed to move at least 2 forwards on the NHL roster in order to have room for Letestu. Unless that happens tomorrow, he almost certainly would end up signing with another team. Because no matter how much he loves Columbus, he can't wait around for them to clear a roster spot for him. He has to secure his future as a player and that means signing the best deal for himself asap."

BlueJackets,3bjxlt,kowdijj,3,Mon Jun 29 23:26:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, but he's going to want term. You know what? I'd give it to him*. Aging? Slow? Probably. But he just won a cup.   As a Swedish defenseman, he could be a great role model for Carlsson or at least create that role on our team now so Carlsson and his teammates will have a better idea about what we want to expect from him.  Edit: *within reason. 3 years max, but try for two? Idk"
BlueJackets,3bjxlt,UrinalPies,5,Mon Jun 29 23:48:35 2015 UTC,"You understand the problems with signing him yet you're willing to bypass them simply because the team he played for just won a Stanley Cup?

Enough value to justify sign an overly expensive, slow and aging defender?"
BlueJackets,3bjxlt,kowdijj,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:01:12 2015 UTC,We need a defenseman. He wasn't so slow that it prevented him from winning a cup this season.

BlueJackets,3bipjn,SomeKindOfMonster,6,Mon Jun 29 15:34:54 2015 UTC,Tampa has not qualified defenceman Mark Barberio and he will become a UFA. Might be an interesting look for the Jackets.
BlueJackets,3bipjn,WannabeFinn,2,Mon Jun 29 15:41:54 2015 UTC,Would be dumb to let Calvert walk for nothing. If you don't think he fits you could at least trade him or his rights.  Pls send that QO Jarmo
BlueJackets,3bipjn,GeekYogurt,2,Mon Jun 29 15:39:30 2015 UTC,saw a tweet they are working on a multi-year extension

BlueJackets,3bi9um,GeekYogurt,15,Mon Jun 29 13:18:08 2015 UTC,Draft grades this soon after are dumb. Management was thrilled after the draft because we got most of the priority 1 guys we were after. People also don't realize that Jarmo had Werenski 2nd over Provorov in defenseman rankings. We did exactly what we needed to do at this draft and didn't swing and miss.   The paragraph they wrote praises our drafting but still only gives us a B+ without explaining why we lost points.
BlueJackets,3bi9um,SomeKindOfMonster,15,Mon Jun 29 13:23:33 2015 UTC,I agree.  but it's the offseason and I'm content starved.  side note: just found out via facebook from CBJ that visa issues will keep Gavrikov away from development camp
BlueJackets,3bi9um,SomeKindOfMonster,3,Mon Jun 29 13:32:05 2015 UTC,Haha fair enough. Also booo visa issues.
BlueJackets,3bi9um,Back41DayOnly,3,Mon Jun 29 13:35:47 2015 UTC,"pure conjecture, but i wonder if that had anything to do with him dropping so far in the draft. some lists even had him Top 50.  edit: They just addressed it on the live stream - potential signability issues because he stands to make more $ in Russia."

BlueJackets,3bi9um,nunoveaux,6,Mon Jun 29 13:44:29 2015 UTC,I'll allow it.
BlueJackets,3bi9um,nunoveaux,3,Mon Jun 29 13:55:18 2015 UTC,"Well at least we only spent a low 6th to draft him, so it's not like we're taking a huge risk in drafting him. If he gets sick of Russia after a year or two, he can develop there and make an impact in the NHL almost immediately while the visa trouble gets worked out."
BlueJackets,3bi9um,nunoveaux,6,Mon Jun 29 15:53:48 2015 UTC,Playing in front of Bob has to be at least a little bit of a draw.
BlueJackets,3bi9um,nunoveaux,2,Mon Jun 29 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"Thats the point of low-round picks too -- Take a guy now with the hopes that the landscape changes in 2-3-4 years.  It's possible that in that time, he becomes an even better defenseman, who could be guaranteed a roster spot on opening night which incentivizes a move to NA.  Or, the KHL's earning power continues to plummet due to their current economic situation (which isn't good) and it becomes more lucrative to play here as well. Or, situation on his current team goes south and he's just looking for a way out.  Things could change in this time, and the more he looks like a sure bet the more the FO will do to try to get him over."
BlueJackets,3bi9um,SomeKindOfMonster,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:58:20 2015 UTC,for what it's worth - i did find an article from before the 2014 draft talking about how he really wants to play in North America

I do agree with you, but I famously remember an ecstatic Doug Maclean holding up the Blue Jackets' big board during the 2003 draft and pointing to Nikoai Zherdev's name being ranked higher than everyone else.  Not saying I think that this pick will be colossally bad, but when teams tout how the guy they got was, like, totally the best player on their board, I leer a bit out of habit."

BlueJackets,3bilnj,GeekYogurt,3,Mon Jun 29 15:23:36 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine Boone being a C over Wenny. Boone did so well his first year as a winger and Wenny really came into his own as the 3rd C late in the year. Assuming we dont bring back LeTestu (could go either way), who is the 4C?   I'm interested to see if any of the young guns not on the roster last year will make the leap this offseason. filling in the wingers around our C's will be a lot of fun to see develop."

Furthermore, unless we can get rid of Bourque and Boll's contract i can't see us pursuing any top Free Agents (probably a good thing really), but could probably swing Rychel and Anisimov for a quality Dman.

BlueJackets,3bilnj,Blahblag12321,3,Mon Jun 29 16:05:02 2015 UTC,I think the team needs Calvert. He just brings such intensity and grit that is hard to find. Worth the money to keep him as a bot 6 guy
BlueJackets,3bilnj,imbored343,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:48:30 2015 UTC,The most worrisome thing about our lineup next year is how reliant we are that Murray has a clean injury free year. He hasn't really proved he can do that.  I don't see how we can afford not to trade for a solid d starter.

BlueJackets,3bj6y5,AKlep,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:59:47 2015 UTC,"The numbers very clearly state that he isn't a fourth line player, that's the beauty of it.   Let's put it this way: would you rather have a top 6 full of first line caliber players, or would you rather have a top 6 with 3 first line players and 3 second line players?  The same logic applies to Jenner. If your team doesn't have ""fourth liners"" then you have a damn good team. Jenner fits the mold the best; he has the size, grit, checking, forechecking, speed, all the intangibles out of your typical fourth line players but he also has the skill and scoring ability to make the fourth line a scoring line, and that's exactly what you want as a hockey team. CBJ are lucky enough to have that opportunity."
BlueJackets,3bj6y5,CBJFan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:02:56 2015 UTC,"I understand the logic, I just think that Boone needs more ice time and a different top 6 talent player should be down on the 4th line. I guess a lot of depends on if Letestu is back or not. If he's not then maybe it would make sense to make Boone the 4th line C just out of necessity and balance (like you suggested). Anisimov could also be the 4th line C if Richards doesn't roll with the Foligno-Dubi-Anisimov line."

BlueJackets,3biqdj,IAmAChemicalEngineer,2,Mon Jun 29 15:41:25 2015 UTC,"The CBJ were very supposedly interested him before he went to Pittsburgh. I'm not sure if his shortened season last year we'll have dampened that enthusiasm or not. At 32 years old, he seems like a short term solution at best."
BlueJackets,3biqdj,notwhoithink,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like he'd be expensive, no?"
BlueJackets,3biqdj,THECapedCaper,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:01:53 2015 UTC,How much do you think he's going to fetch? Figured it'd be somewhere in the low to mid-$3M range. Doesn't seem too bad.
BlueJackets,3biqdj,notwhoithink,2,Mon Jun 29 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"He got $4 million last year from the Pens, and another $850k in buyout money from Buffalo (that they will be paying for the next 13 years)."
BlueJackets,3biqdj,habituallysuspect,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:08:41 2015 UTC,Holy shit that's a long buyout. Was that one of the special CBA buyouts that doesn't affect their cap?  I'd check myself but mobile is hard :(
BlueJackets,3biqdj,notwhoithink,2,Mon Jun 29 19:23:30 2015 UTC,"NHL contract buyouts are basically 2/3 of the money owed on the rest of the contract spread over twice as many years. When the Sabres bought him out the remaining contract term was $18 million over 7 years, so that worked out to $12 million over 14 years in the buyout.  The only difference between the regular and compliance buyouts is that the compliance buyouts do not count against the salary cap. And yes, this was a compliance buyout.  BTW, Mike Commodore's buyout from the CBJ was just paid off at the end of the 2014-15 season."
BlueJackets,3biqdj,georgedubbya43,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:35:03 2015 UTC,I think if we can snag him for around 4-5 it would be worth it. It's a lot of money but we're solid on F and were one great D away from being a well rounded team. Plus he'd be great for Murray and werenski' development.

BlueJackets,3bbs1i,nunoveaux,7,Sat Jun 27 18:35:44 2015 UTC,"Werenski and Vainio are super young. Werenski doesn't turn 18 for another month or so and VV just turned 18 like 2 weeks ago. They're both going to be studs in my mind. Gavrikov is a steal in the 6th round in terms of value. Carlsson, Stenlund, and Nutivaara I'm on the fence about but hoping for the best. Kolesar and Ruopp were head scratchers considering who all was still on the board.  Bittner, well.. I fucking love Bittner."
BlueJackets,3bbs1i,WannabeFinn,2,Sat Jun 27 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"Nice assessment. I'm not a fan of Carlsson. Pains me a bit to see JK take him at the expense of others.  However, I feel like Jarmo did a great job in the later rounds."

BlueJackets,3bbs1i,justthetip751,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:49:34 2015 UTC,"I like Stenlund. He's a practical combo of both size and skill, rather than Kolesar who is ""skilled for his size,"" Stenlund is skilled and big! If they're drafting for size I'd much rather Stenlund types.  I agree with your head scratchers. I know it's the 7th round but Nutivaara is just a dumb pick imo.  I'm excited to see how Bittner does without Petan and Bjork next year."
BlueJackets,3bbs1i,UrinalPies,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:12:46 2015 UTC,I think if kolesar can get better we have space for him.  CBJ needs the hard hitting bodies.  Hes also only 18

BlueJackets,3bbs1i,habituallysuspect,4,Sun Jun 28 03:29:45 2015 UTC,"I think we got some really nice steals in Bittner, Vainio and Gavrikov. Overall I think it was a solid draft for the Jackets, and they're kind of flying under the radar with some of their picks."
BlueJackets,3bbs1i,jpsquill,4,Sat Jun 27 19:50:19 2015 UTC,"After three drafts, it appears that Jarmo is not one to trade picks for players. With any of our three seconds, I would have loved to been able to pick up a Top 4 Defenseman. We still have Rychel and Arty as good trade bait, though, and with Free Agency coming up I'd love to see someone get signed.  This was a very solid draft otherwise. When they said we were going after defense, they meant it. If one of those guys gets into the NHL lineup late this year or even next season, this draft will be a huge success."
BlueJackets,3bbs1i,THECapedCaper,3,Sat Jun 27 19:58:30 2015 UTC,"I'm concerned with the ""defensive defenseman"" tag that's on Carlsson & Gavrikov. Usually ""defensive defenseman"" at their best are only effective in one end of the rink, which is a big sacrifice in today's game.  I also hate the Kolesar pick. There were still some really high skilled players on the board and they went with a giant grinder known for his body checks. Don't like that thought process.  Other than that I am mildly happy with the rest of the draft. Werenski is a great pick and I think staying at 8 was a very smart decision. I like Vaino a lot as well."
BlueJackets,3bbs1i,UrinalPies,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:23:20 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I've seen in some of the scouting reports that our defensive dmen draft picks--I can't remember which ones right now--are stylistically similar to Methot. When you think about what Methot has done for Karlsson's game, I think having some of these kids in the system could be great.  Maybe Gavrikov or Carlsson could turn into the reliable defensive presence needed for Murray to blossom into an offensive powerhouse in a few years."
BlueJackets,3bbs1i,habituallysuspect,3,Sun Jun 28 03:34:24 2015 UTC,They always could turn into that. But let me ask you this: would you rather draft the guy that's supposed to be like Methot or a guy that's supposed to be like Karlsson?
BlueJackets,3bbs1i,UrinalPies,3,Sun Jun 28 03:42:12 2015 UTC,Well if you can have one of each then why not both?
BlueJackets,3bbs1i,NLP19,2,Sun Jun 28 03:46:56 2015 UTC,"CBJ had the chance to Kylington, a guy whose production rivals that of Karlsson when he was over in Sweden. They had the chance 3 times. Instead they traded up to get Carlsson (the Methot), drafted Bittner, and drafted a Kolesar (a grinder!).   They had the chance to get one of each and they chose not to, that's why I think it's a problem.   Disclaimer: I know that Kylington very well turn into nothing for the Flames. But he's a high skill guy that has the opportunity to be an impact player. I'd rather strike out trying to get the Karlsson than trade up to get the Methot."
BlueJackets,3bbs1i,UrinalPies,2,Sun Jun 28 04:13:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I fully agree, but you never know with Jarmo. He knows how to draft."
BlueJackets,3bbs1i,NLP19,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:25:09 2015 UTC,I sure hope so. I just feel like there were better/more promising bets out there for pretty much all selections after Werenski.   All we can do is wait and see now!
BlueJackets,3bbs1i,UrinalPies,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:31:56 2015 UTC,"Having ""defensive defencemen"" is a must if you want to have a team that gets it done in the play-offs. At least Tampa seems to think so. They traded their 1st round pick to add one defensive defence man with size (Coburn).  Jon Cooper said that if you want to win Cups you need to play D."
BlueJackets,3bbs1i,Lahtelainen,2,Mon Jun 29 10:26:11 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with our picks. We definitely bulked up in this draft. I suspect that Werenski and Bittner will be ready not this season, but the season after. Carlsson is the same way. We still need a defenseman or two for this coming season. A trade will most likely happen, knowing Jarmo, when we least expect it and it will be something good. And we can't forget that buyout of a certain player that needs to take place sooner rather than later."

BlueJackets,3bbgki,CraniumFornication,3,Sun Jun 28 01:53:01 2015 UTC,Worth mentioning. The Canes aren't worried about cap space. They have plenty. They are more worried about actual money and Columbus front loaded his contact so he is only paid 8mil over the next two seasons which is more reasonable. So that is ideal for us.
BlueJackets,3bbgki,XdshortX,4,Sat Jun 27 20:14:47 2015 UTC,"We are worried about money. We don't abide by the cap ceiling we abide by Karmanos' budget. That is to say, 4 million over the next two years is still steep for us."
BlueJackets,3bbgki,CraniumFornication,5,Sat Jun 27 21:00:24 2015 UTC,It is still steep but 4mil is reasonable for a top 4 defender across the league. To expect less isn't very reasonable. We were lucky they paid the majority of his contact for us and it is part of the reason this one sided trade was possible.  They needed cap relief which we could provide and we needed a top 4 D for a reasonable amount of money.
BlueJackets,3bbgki,XdshortX,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:12:53 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind were only up 1.5 million. We gave away a good goalie to get this, they need Khoudobin to let Gibson play in the minors.

BlueJackets,3bbgki,CraniumFornication,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:17:32 2015 UTC,You're right. Though with Lack we are solid in the goalie position and it isn't easy to acquire a top 4 defender in this league for essentially a backup goalie.
BlueJackets,3bbgki,CrazyLegLaFleur1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:20:53 2015 UTC,"You kinda didn't get a top 4 defender.

Don't get me wrong I think Wiz is a good player and I'm glad he will get to go to team to get some playing time, he deserves it. I just think he is more of a bandaid for a defense needy team. I could be wrong, and I hope I am cause like I said Wiz is awesome and I hope he has a good career. It just doesn't look good and I don't expect him to be playing for you in 2 years, as I think you will be looking for a long term solution."
BlueJackets,3bbgki,CraniumFornication,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:10:18 2015 UTC,That's a fair assessment and spot on about him being on the team in 2 years. It's a stop gap and we need power play help. Plus we need a physical defender. So it works out well for us. He doesn't need to be a top pairing but if he can be put with a defensive d man on the second pairing I think he'll serve what we need.
BlueJackets,3bbgki,overcatastrophe,16,Mon Jun 29 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"Youre going to watch him fire a howitzer from the blue line and about once a game, you will see him drop someone with his shot.  He makes a guy think twice about sacrificing his body to block a shot"

Wiz is great at creating shots 5v5 and is one of the best powerplay quarterbacks in the league. Good shot, decent skater, great first pass but the inevitable turnovers will bother people. People will also mention his cap hit but it is worth it for a player of his caliber IMO."
BlueJackets,3bbgki,Man_Bear_Pig08,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:25:04 2015 UTC,"He such a good defender he's been traded twice in less than a year. I called him being not good when we traded him and everyone freaked out because he's a great person/teammate. He has an unbelievable slap shot but he gets burned constantly because he gets caught to low below the blueline (looking to set up for the one timer) and gives up odd man rushes. Unfortunately his lack of defense ends up outweighing his slapshot and nobody wants him. Don't worry though, you'll trade him at the deadline this year if someone will take his cap hit. We traded him to make things more attractive to mike Reilly (who can eat shit)"
BlueJackets,3bbgki,CBJFan,2,Sat Jun 27 18:01:38 2015 UTC,Being traded has nothing to do with being bad or good. despres overachieved and made him expendable. Wiz has plenty to give an NHL team.
BlueJackets,3bbgki,Man_Bear_Pig08,0,Sat Jun 27 20:57:44 2015 UTC,Hes a career -22 as a defensemen
BlueJackets,3bb0t4,jpsquill,9,Sat Jun 27 14:27:26 2015 UTC,"I think this could be the steal of the second round.  I might be making the trip up to Cleveland to watch him and Ollie some. No real need to rush Bjorkstrand, so these two can adjust and develop alongside each other.   Totally jazzed on this one. Jarmo looks at more than players. He picks people that he can put in good situations."
BlueJackets,3bb0t4,43goalie,6,Sat Jun 27 18:22:30 2015 UTC,Solid pick it seems like. From what the announcers are saying some people thought he could have even went in the first.

BlueJackets,3b956f,notwhoithink,2,Sat Jun 27 03:26:24 2015 UTC,"And the whole thing about wanting to finish school first is part of the reason that he was picked in the 4th round. Most picks that deep never play in the NHL anyway, so it's not that big of a loss.  The thing about Reilly was that he was nothing special when he was drafted, then he became special as he grew. Werenski is special now and will get better. Reilly wasn't likely to sign a contract until he finished school. Werenski will probably leave school early. If Reilly had been so highly rated as a sophomore them he probably would have signed as well."

BlueJackets,3b956f,GeekYogurt,4,Sat Jun 27 01:39:16 2015 UTC,"teams hardly ever get better for next year at the draft. Even if CBJ would have gotten Hanafin he isn't widely regarded as completely NHL ready, and many people think that Werenski has a similar ceiling to Hanafin.   The team got better by not giving up assets to draft Hanafin, who, despite being highly touted, is an unknown commodity that they might have forced into the NHL before he was ready."

BlueJackets,3b9je8,Lindkvist15,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:32:31 2015 UTC,Have you watched him play or are you just citing others? What I'm confused by (as a Swede) is how he's picked so high when he hasn't played ANY senior hockey. Most Swedish picks play in SHL or Allsvenskan - Not J20.
BlueJackets,3b9je8,WannabeFinn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:42:24 2015 UTC,but he played 7 games SHL last season?

BlueJackets,3b9je8,UrinalPies,0,Sat Jun 27 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, but stay-at-home D are typically only productive at one end of the rink, which is worrisome. I hope at some point Jarmo has something to show for taking Heatherington, Collins, and Carlsson so high. I'm not sure he ever gets there though. I hope he proves me wrong."
BlueJackets,3b9je8,WannabeFinn,2,Sat Jun 27 02:51:32 2015 UTC,Let's say only 1 of those 3 guys turns into a Niklas Hjalmarsson or Marc Methot type. Wouldn't you be glad we spent those 2nd rounders?
BlueJackets,3b9je8,UrinalPies,0,Sat Jun 27 02:52:47 2015 UTC,I'd be happy if any of them turned into legit NHLers. Just personally don't think they have the best chance to do it out of the players they could have had.
BlueJackets,3b9je8,WannabeFinn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:01:49 2015 UTC,That's a reasonable concern. I suppose I've just got a lot of faith in Jarmo.
BlueJackets,3b9je8,UrinalPies,2,Sat Jun 27 03:05:04 2015 UTC,"heh, I thought it was pretty reasonable. Looks like someone disagrees though.   Honestly I have faith in Jarmo to a certain extent. He proved me wrong on the Dano situation and now Dano is my favorite player. I just see skill players making splashes in the NHL left and right, and look at all the recent Norris winners or the guys who are consistently regarded as the best defenders on their team. They can all produce and all are offensively minded.   I hope Carlsson can get there. I haven't seen him play at all so I'm not willing to say that he can't get there, it's just troublesome that he hasn't shown the ability to produce even in the junior leagues when a guy like Kylington is producing at a pace comparable to Erik Karlsson and Victor Hedman and OEL in the same league that Carlsson played in this year."
BlueJackets,3b9je8,WannabeFinn,2,Sat Jun 27 03:26:34 2015 UTC,"If it comforts you any, Hjalmarsson had 0 points in 14 SHL games his draft year. Carlsson had 2 points in 7. Hjalmarsson even only had 2 points in his draft+2 year.  Now he's putting up ~17 points per 82 games and anchors a 2nd pairing on a perennial Cup contender.  http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=83449  http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?player=187919  And all is not yet lost on Kylington. He's still available :)"
BlueJackets,3b9je8,Swabeky,2,Sat Jun 27 03:29:55 2015 UTC,"Nah, Erik Karlsson was a shell of his norris winning self when Marc Methot wasn't playing.  A guy like Carlsson will free up guys like Murray and Werenski.  It's like the yin and yang of defensive partnerships."
BlueJackets,3b9je8,WannabeFinn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:43:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd spend 34th + 68th picks on a Methot/Hjalmarsson-type guy any day of the week. Not saying he'll be as good as them, but if he can get somewhere near that.. definitely worth it."

BlueJackets,3b9cx9,HermanBonJovi,8,Sat Jun 27 14:10:05 2015 UTC,PSA: Being drafted before your freshman season (Reilly) and after your freshman season (Werenski) mean different things for the team that owns the player's contract rights.  I have 100% faith in Werenski staying with this organization.
BlueJackets,3b9cx9,WannabeFinn,4,Sat Jun 27 03:19:13 2015 UTC,I would say getting a #38 pick if Werenski doesn't sign is poor compensation. It's still a risk... and actually not that different at all.

Four years later, after a college career, the Jets didn't tender Leveille an offer, making him a free agent. For this, Winnipeg will get the 29th pick of the 2nd round as a compensatory selection).

Just because he seems a lot different doesn't mean it COULDNT happen.

BlueJackets,3b9cx9,Man_Bear_Pig08,3,Sat Jun 27 12:36:19 2015 UTC,"You could say the same thing about Jack Eichel (2nd overall) or Noah Hanifin (5th overall), but nobody believes that it will be the case with either of the three of them. This is just another case of uninformed fans getting ready to jump off of a bridge because they lost out on a former 4th round pick. It's only a comparable situation if you know nothing about hockey and the draft."
BlueJackets,3b9cx9,Bubbz1211,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:21:36 2015 UTC,It does mean it couldn't happen. He has 3 more years of eligibility not 4. If he stayed for all 3 (which he won't) he would have to sign to play and he couldn't sign elsewhere unless he sat out an entire season which would ruin his career.

BlueJackets,3b98hv,MacerV,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:11:19 2015 UTC,"Oduya is unrestricted, wouldn't have to give up anything but money.  I am hesitant on him, he seems to turnover a lot."
BlueJackets,3b98hv,IAmAChemicalEngineer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:31:44 2015 UTC,One extra season in the AHL won't hurt him but I see him contending for a roster spot at training camp for sure.
BlueJackets,3b98hv,GeekYogurt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:43:45 2015 UTC,"With the Werenski selection, we need a defenseman now. If it means moving Rychel then so be it. I believe we have the forward depth.  Johansen, Atkinson, Jenner, Foligno, Dubinsky, Hartnell, Wennberg, Dano, Calvert. Nine forwards right there where they could make three solid lines. Not to mention Milano and Bjorkstrand in the next couple years. I'd prefer to see him go for defense."
BlueJackets,3b98hv,notwhoithink,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:38:40 2015 UTC,"Thinking more last night about the Werenski selection made me like it more... potentially. I was hoping we'd get NHL ready talent or the best D-man in the draft. But, ""NHL ready"" and ""best in draft"" doesn't really mean ""good next year."" We need ""good"" right now. Not a year or two from now. We don't have time to waste developing a guy in Columbus. We need a vet. And so I'm happy we picked a guy who can wait in reserve a couple years while we fill our holes through trades or an FA."
BlueJackets,3b98hv,knukklez,0,Sat Jun 27 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the 4th lingers.

BlueJackets,3b6vs7,ScarletWitch65,2,Fri Jun 26 15:32:26 2015 UTC,We have not. In yesterday's CBJin30 McGelligot said there's no hurry since he's very unlikely to get an offer sheet.
BlueJackets,3b6vs7,imbored343,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:17:50 2015 UTC,I haven't heard anything about that either. Very quiet on the CBJ front. Calm before the storm?
BlueJackets,3b6vs7,ScarletWitch65,2,Fri Jun 26 15:38:06 2015 UTC,I bet you it depends on if we move Arty or not.
BlueJackets,3b6vs7,imbored343,3,Fri Jun 26 16:12:30 2015 UTC,Just got all excited as I got a notification on the Blue Jackets app. Thought something happened. Nope. Just draft party info.
BlueJackets,3b6vs7,Logosmonkey,2,Fri Jun 26 15:22:44 2015 UTC,Same here. Then there was just another one when Jarmo joined in on CBJin30.   That app may cause me to have a heart attack before the end of the day.

Time to look towards NJD at 6 (and needing scoring - plus having Severson and Merrill) or Boston with the Hamilton situation. Hanifin would be great, but c'mon."

BlueJackets,3b75vh,Aperture-Employee,0,Fri Jun 26 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think they got it wrong. They don't decide what is right or wrong, they decide what the Constitution says about issues. The Constitution does not say or imply that gay marriage (or even straight marriage) is a right.   The end result may be right, but them sticking their nose into individual state issues is not right. Let the voters in each state decide."

It's so rare to be able to put together 2 young, top talents in their position. I'd much rather address our needs this way than take a chance on signing a fuck face prima donna ""star"" like jeff butthole carter. I get that most likely any established player may not be as big of a disaster as carter but why take the chance, I mean our track record with acquiring star players isn't exactly good."
BlueJackets,3b3eov,CrazyLegLaFleur1,6,Thu Jun 25 18:53:23 2015 UTC,This guy gets it.
BlueJackets,3b3eov,el_karacho,3,Thu Jun 25 18:54:12 2015 UTC,No guarantee the Hanafin goes pro.  I would be surprised if he didn't play another year at BC.
BlueJackets,3b3eov,el_karacho,2,Thu Jun 25 20:14:20 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter when he gets here -- When he get's here, it'll be huge."
BlueJackets,3b3eov,el_karacho,7,Thu Jun 25 20:19:00 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, but CBJ has a pressing need for on-ice success NOW. A win on draft day is great for JD and Jarmo, but it doesn't put butts in seats or the Cup in our city unless it materializes this upcoming season.  Last season was an anomaly, this season they NEED to get into the playoffs and they NEED to win once they're there.  EDIT: I'm not saying CBJ is a playoff team ONLY with Hanafin.  I think there are many ways to get there, but leveraging guys like Arty and Kerby for a future prospect are, IMO, not the right way to get there, even for a potentially rare talent.  Murray is a rare talent that just can't seem to stay healthy, who's to say Hanafin doesn't turn out the same?  /armchairgm"
BlueJackets,3b3eov,CrazyLegLaFleur1,3,Thu Jun 25 20:34:25 2015 UTC,"Judged in a vacuum -- sure, I agree.  But, if you turn around and swing another trade to bring in top-4 D help from a cap team then that changes the equation quite a bit.  Plus, Columbus shouldn't expect to be this high up in a draft again for a while, and players like Hanifin are going to cost us a lot more to get if we're picking 16+ for the next 5 years. Why not reach a bit when the assets are there to get him?"
BlueJackets,3b3eov,el_karacho,2,Thu Jun 25 20:44:42 2015 UTC,"Totally fair points, especially re: draft position.  I might also be slightly biased against Hanafin as a BU Alum.  It already annoys me how much I enjoy rooting for Cam, having another Eagle join the team is a cringeworthy possibility, no matter how transcendent his skills."
BlueJackets,3b3eov,CrazyLegLaFleur1,2,Thu Jun 25 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"I think you both raise great points. My stance is that of we can get this deal done, then we should to secure our future cause we don't know when we will have another chance to get this caliber of player. This move also just opens a little more cap space so we can still pursue a free agent for immediate help, since Hanifin might go back to college. We also would only be moving 1 starting forward in this deal, so another trade would not be impossible."
BlueJackets,3b3eov,el_karacho,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"As long as the right pieces are in place, I think it's no sweat to lose Arty.  He's a great center and his backhand shot is the stuff of legend, but I'm pretty sure there's only one or two true wingers on CBJ, everyone else is a C who can take faceoffs and still move to the wings when needed.  I just don't want to see them throw too much at the Yotes to get it done.  Hindsight is 20/20 but even without knowing what injury issues would come, I still don't know why CBJ wouldn't accept the ALLEGED offer from Garth Snow of the Isles' entire draft for Ryan Murray.  Murray is/was supposed to be that type of transcendent player and even when healthy no one's seen that type of play out of him.  I'd much rather have all those potential prospects/draft picks."
BlueJackets,3b3eov,GeekYogurt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't want to pay too much to move up, but this seems about the right price to pay. I love Arty and was very against moving him when it all started a while ago, but now we are in the position where it just makes sense to move him. I see our starting centers as Joey, Dubi, Wenny, and hopefully Testy(best nickname). So Arty is kind of the odd man out and he only has 1 more year. I do think you are being a little hard on Murray cause he has shown some flashes of greatness and if he could stay healthy we might not be talking about a big need at defense. While I do think winning now is important, I think a move like this would show we are not content with only winning now. We want to establish ourselves as a winning team long term and become a perennial playoff team."

And Rychel is just another piece we have too much of. The trade makes so much sense for everyone, and if Arizona still wants defense, they should have Provorov or Werenski available."

Use the 8th pick to grab Hannifin (unlikely), Provorov or Werenski and package Arty (most underrated Jacket), Rychel and one or two second round picks to get a top 4 d-man from a cash strapped team to play next season."
BlueJackets,3b3eov,GeekYogurt,3,Thu Jun 25 17:34:16 2015 UTC,My only issue is if Hanifin doesn't play in the NHL next year... which seems possible.

If we are going to pay a large price in terms of players or picks, I'd rather it be for someone who can make a difference now....not 2-3 yrs from now. Plus Provorov and Werenski seem like very talented defenseman that we could grab at 8."

BlueJackets,3b3eov,Logosmonkey,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:58:50 2015 UTC,I would be fine if we could keep our 8th and just do a swap for Rychel/Arty. I hate losing Arty but it is inevitable - we're trading him for something no matter what.   Still I would be more inclined to agree with you. Take who we can at 8th and use R/A as a chip for a seasoned defense.
BlueJackets,3b3eov,SomeKindOfMonster,5,Thu Jun 25 18:09:51 2015 UTC,"The fact that Arty hasn't been able to moved for defense already makes me wonder how highly he is actually valued. At this point, the team that gets him is getting an ok #2C or good #3C for just one year who is unlikely to make a significant impact.   I'm not saying it doesn't happen. But, ALL the value is coming from Rychel."
BlueJackets,3b3eov,buckeye_baker,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:28:52 2015 UTC,Very true. Though if he hadn't gotten injured last year I am pretty sure we could have gotten a decent return for him. That may well have been the apex of his value though and it's probably worth getting him off our roster as soon as we can.
BlueJackets,3b3eov,notwhoithink,2,Thu Jun 25 18:31:33 2015 UTC,I feel like a mid-season trade to an injury depleted contender for a mid-high draft pick is actually our highest possible return... problem is we were that team last year.
BlueJackets,3b3eov,flyerfanatic93,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:41:15 2015 UTC,true but if he stays healthy this season I could see him being traded at the deadline in either a package or a second or maybe even a frist round pick.

From what I've seen, Hanifin is clearly the best skater and the most offensively gifted of the three, but I must say, I'm a huge fan of Werenski's all-around play. Hanifin has more wow factor and can probably change a game all by himself. Werenski on the other end, is super reliable, capable of playing big minutes and is a go-to guy if you need to protect a lead at the end of a game.  I don't think moving up to #3 would be a bad thing (considering we're trading a prospect and a guy that would play on the bottom-6 for us), but personally, I'm comfortable with the #8 spot."

BlueJackets,3b5wc1,flyerfanatic93,2,Fri Jun 26 05:50:45 2015 UTC,But then we don't get the pleasure of saying he was drafted by us! No one gets to go up to the podium! Haha that would really bother me for some reason
BlueJackets,3b5wc1,NLP19,2,Fri Jun 26 07:21:36 2015 UTC,"In order to make a trade, you have to have a willing trade partner.  In order to have a willing trade partner you have to find someone willing to part with what you're asking for, and you need to have something that they want in return.  Our pick is 8th.  Edmonton and Buffalo are going to take McDavid and Eichel, no question about it.  Hanifin is the 3rd rated North American in the draft, so there's a fair chance that Arizona would pick him at #3 anyway.  Even if he doesn't go third, both New Jersey (6th) and Philadelphia (7th) need help on defense and would absolutely draft him if he is still available.  Now how do we swing a trade with either of those teams?  They need defense, we need defense, and they just drafted the best defenseman available in the draft.  What do we have that they would accept in trade?  How could we pull that off without overpaying?  On the other hand, Arizona is in a bit of a rebuild and needs prospects.  We have lots of prospects at forward, and they're good ones.  We can also offer them the #8 pick, ensuring that they don't fall too far down in the draft order, and we have plenty of 2nd round picks in a very deep draft.  There probably is no better potential trade pairing that the CBJ and Coyotes for the #3, unless you believe the rumors that the Coyotes would be willing to trade the #3 to St. Louis for T.J. Oshie."
BlueJackets,3b5wc1,notwhoithink,2,Fri Jun 26 10:18:08 2015 UTC,"NJ has a ton of Dmen.  NJ needs forwards not D. Not trying to nitpick, but its unlikely NJ takes a Dman.  That said, if Hannifin drops to 6, Id be surprised if they didnt take the (arguably) 3rd best player in this years draft.    NJ would be a perfect trade partner for CBJ.  NJ has much D need F, CBJ has much F, need D."
BlueJackets,3b5wc1,HermanBonJovi,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:06:19 2015 UTC,Hmm...i thought for sure that NJ was the other team ahead of us (besides Philly) looking for defensemen. Must have been thinking of someone else.
BlueJackets,3b5wc1,notwhoithink,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:08:39 2015 UTC,Possibly.  NJ is my 2nd team so I follow them almost as closely as CBJ. NJ DEF needs forwards as NJ cant score goals to support Schneider playing so well.

BlueJackets,3az75z,nunoveaux,5,Wed Jun 24 18:08:30 2015 UTC,Which options do we have?    This signing really feels like the goalies on the trade market are way too expensive as it is.
BlueJackets,3az75z,THECapedCaper,7,Wed Jun 24 18:19:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't see where trying to trade for a backup or try and score one in free agency would help, either.

BlueJackets,3az75z,UrinalPies,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:27:47 2015 UTC,"well, we do have goalies in the system and Forsberg will likely be good enough to be a backup in 2016-17.  Backup goaltender is never a position that you have to sign for more than one year. There are only 30 positions around the league for it and there are usually tons of guys to be had for cheap. Signing an old goaltender for 2 years is silly."
BlueJackets,3az75z,nunoveaux,3,Wed Jun 24 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"But you'd be willing to put Forsberg in for 12 starts in 14 games if Bob goes down with an injury again? Forsberg's NHL start last season left a little to be desired... .871, .870, .893, .733, .897  Don't forget, there a big unknown with Bobrovsky in that he's yet to put together a full, healthy season with Columbus since his arrival.

If Forsberg does usurp McElhinney next year team would still have to eat his 800k contract even if it was in the AHL. and if they only signed McElhinney to a 1 year contract and they weren't comfortable with Forsberg, then they could simply go and sign another player that is just as good or potentially better than McElhinney for cheap in 16-17. Hell, they could re-sign McElhinney to another 1-year deal if they were so inclined.  So again, signing an old, replaceable, & unpredictable player for more than 1 year doesn't make much sense from a financial standpoint or a hockey standpoint IMO.  I'm sure they did an opportunity cost analysis, but without knowing what/who they actually analyzed I can't really be 100% confident in the outcome, and I'm not.   And the bigger problems are irrelevant. If you're going to fix it, then fix it right. And in my opinion they didn't (which I understand doesn't have to be your opinion).  Edit: wording"

I'm thinking Zito will handle the AHL players that have no real chance at the NHL i.e. AHL lifers or fringe AHL/ECHL players.  Doesn't matter if Jarmo has the official title or not.

BlueJackets,3au04m,HORSEtheGAME,3,Tue Jun 23 14:59:26 2015 UTC,According to General Fanager we have 8.2m in capspace. That being said I don't know if the team has an internal cap and/or what it is set at.  A lot of our dudes are locked up in long term deals but Boone Jenner and basically all of our defense needs a new contract in 2 years.

BlueJackets,3au04m,justthetip751,2,Tue Jun 23 20:09:22 2015 UTC,While we might be interested it's highly unlikely. Offer sheets rarely turn into a team move. They are almost always matched. Now Jarmo could go wild west and push Hamilton's pay up with a crazy ass offer sheet to force the Bruins to make another move to relieve cap space but that's also unlikely and would likely backfire when we have RFAs up to resign.   Mostly GMs don't fuck with them because they don't want another GM fucking with their offer sheets when the time comes.

Personally, I like what Burns brings to a team. He's got character, size, a $5.5ish cap hit, and he's got a wicked shot from the point.

BlueJackets,3aro6a,WannabeFinn,6,Tue Jun 23 01:40:22 2015 UTC,I love Buff but that guy is not worth the 8th overall and a prospect who's projected to end up getting Top 6 minutes

BlueJackets,3aro6a,Aperture-Employee,2,Tue Jun 23 04:10:53 2015 UTC,The contract length is really the issue. I can't think of a more exciting player to watch every night (that is realistically moveable).
BlueJackets,3aro6a,SergayBoobtitsky,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:44:20 2015 UTC,I read the 8th wrong as just a first round pick. I don't actually think we would need to give up our 8th. Rychel and one of our first round picks maybe.
BlueJackets,3aro6a,Logosmonkey,5,Tue Jun 23 01:42:52 2015 UTC,Something something for a defensemen.   Jarmo is making it very well known that he's in the market for defensemen. I suspect he will pull off some trade for a good top four player.
BlueJackets,3aro6a,Logosmonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:44:21 2015 UTC,Is it odd that i hope we trade with NJ for 1 of their D-men?  I like Rychel but if hes gotta go i want him to go to my 2nd team.
BlueJackets,3aro6a,HermanBonJovi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:43:17 2015 UTC,Ducks have said they want to move up. I would find it hilarious if we somehow traded to get Wiz back that also included another defenseman and getting rid of Boroque and/or Clarkson.

BlueJackets,3alvno,Swabeky,12,Mon Jun 22 18:25:54 2015 UTC,Wennberg.  After a year of being put into tough spots playing defense I would love to see a 50pt season.  Kid has talent but didn't score much last year and I think he'll get over the hump.
BlueJackets,3alvno,IAmAChemicalEngineer,5,Sun Jun 21 14:39:03 2015 UTC,"He made major strides in his game at the end last year, I really hope the line stays Hartnell-Wennberg-Dano throughout the season next year."
BlueJackets,3alvno,WannabeFinn,6,Sun Jun 21 14:52:23 2015 UTC,God damn. That'll be a hell of a third line.
BlueJackets,3alvno,Swabeky,2,Sun Jun 21 15:04:24 2015 UTC,"if they play like they did it'd more than likely be the 2nd line with Calvert(?)-Dubinsky-Atkinson being the ""3rd"" line like we saw in 2013-14"
BlueJackets,3alvno,imbored343,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:54:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know why they would break up such an obviously good line, only Todd Richards will know for sure."
BlueJackets,3alvno,imbored343,10,Mon Jun 22 20:29:34 2015 UTC,"I'm unsure as to whether you can call it ""breaking out"" per say, but i reckon Ryan Murray will show everyone exactly how good he is in 2015-16."
BlueJackets,3alvno,kowdijj,10,Sun Jun 21 15:14:38 2015 UTC,For us to have a good year we need him to stay healthy.
BlueJackets,3alvno,XdefeatsY,6,Sun Jun 21 15:15:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Murray at 100% makes this team a real playoff threat"
BlueJackets,3alvno,logicoLe,2,Sun Jun 21 15:17:45 2015 UTC,I hope you're right. Murray is super important to our team already and he hasn't even really got going on the league yet.
BlueJackets,3alvno,logicoLe,8,Mon Jun 22 12:46:00 2015 UTC,"I am expecting Wennberg and/or Dano to come out and light the lamp quite a bit for the 2015-2016 season. They both got better after some conditioning time in the minors. Near the end of this past season, Dano was really heating up and made the case to me that he has the potential to be a pure goal scorer in the NHL. Wenny got better and better as time went on. I think if he has a little more confidence in his ability to just shoot the puck rather than always looking to pass for the perfect play, his point totals could be pretty great next year. I really hope that line with Hartnell stays intact for next season.   And of course, if Ryan Murray can stay 100% next year -- that's gonna be dangerous for other teams."
BlueJackets,3alvno,AutomatonFood,2,Sun Jun 21 15:44:01 2015 UTC,Let's not forget about the possibility that Rychel (if we keep him) and Bjorkstrand could make the team next year.
BlueJackets,3alvno,NLP19,7,Sun Jun 21 15:46:44 2015 UTC,"Another guy poised to have a ""breakout-ish"" year is Cam. He finished out last season playing really well with Joey. I think he comes in hot this next season with solid chemistry on the top line with Joey and Boone and scores 30+ goals."
BlueJackets,3alvno,infiniteshadow,4,Sun Jun 21 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people want to trade him, the chemistry with Johansen can't be matched."
BlueJackets,3alvno,Drithyin,2,Sun Jun 21 16:22:33 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. I am a Cam fan. Those two are perfectly capable of becoming a very solid duo, Thorton and Pavelski come to mind."
BlueJackets,3alvno,HermanBonJovi,6,Sun Jun 21 16:26:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with Marko Dano, kid is going to score a lot of goals. Wennberg is going to do all the little things right, that most people don't notice."
BlueJackets,3alvno,Zherdev,4,Sun Jun 21 15:22:33 2015 UTC,"I'm going off the board and picking Michael Chaput. This really isn't a prediction as much as it is a hope, buttttt hopefully he has a breakthrough year"

BlueJackets,3alvno,Logosmonkey,3,Mon Jun 22 07:25:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there are a lot of players that wouldn't surprise me if they took a big step next season. In order of likelihood (imo):   Wennberg/Dano: Seem most poised for big years after a solid youngster season. Murray: If that dude's healthy all year, we will be in for a treat.   Jenner: He's shown a lot of promise and has proven he can be an aggressive checker, but I wouldn't be too surprised if his scoring improves.    Cam: Had a few rough droughts through the past season, but showed some flash late with RyJo. If he gets a favorable placement in the lineup, we could expect some added scoring. I think his is highly dependent on players around him, though.   Sadly, I also think we have a couple players that might be poised for a regression.   Hartnell: He's not getting younger, and if his kid/kid/goat line isn't preserved, he might not have the same level of productivity we saw this past season.    Foligno: Was it a breakout year or a fluke? I hope the former, but it might be the latter."
BlueJackets,3alvno,flyerfanatic93,6,Mon Jun 22 13:10:21 2015 UTC,The Chaperone Line will break out huge next season. Itll be awesome.
BlueJackets,3alvno,phaqueNaiyem,2,Sun Jun 21 18:38:25 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go with David Savard. Had close to 40 points this season and had 11 goals. He's only 24 and this season for him was leaps and bounds better than 2013-2014
BlueJackets,3alvno,Pyzorz,3,Sun Jun 21 19:21:09 2015 UTC,"He still makes bumbling mistakes sometimes, but he had a lot of moments this last season that made his naysayers eat their words. I hope this next season is good for him."
BlueJackets,3alvno,Seebs9,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:40:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he makes some dumb mistakes but he has made less year over year. The organization really believes in him, so that's good. I think he'll shine this season."

BlueJackets,3aka9c,ScarletWitch65,3,Sun Jun 21 01:03:10 2015 UTC,This. Maybe Josh Anderson a little bit.
BlueJackets,3aka9c,justthetip751,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:12:20 2015 UTC,I would love to see Anderson play.

BlueJackets,3aka9c,justthetip751,5,Sun Jun 21 18:38:44 2015 UTC,"Likely: Karlsson, Madaisky, Chaput, Forsberg, Anderson  Possibly: Milano, Bjorkstrand, Heatherington  Least likely: Tynan, Korpisalo  As for the other prospects worthy of mention like Moutrey, Zaar, etc. I don't really know where they fit.  Basically, Likely = Older prospects with some NHL experience and likely ready physically. Possibly = highly touted prospects with minimal professional experience who are potentially lacking physically. Least likely = prospects far down the depth chart who have shown flashes of brilliance worthy of a cup of coffee in the NHL, but lack the consistency or size to actually be a call-up."

BlueJackets,3aka9c,HermanBonJovi,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:23:15 2015 UTC,"I have a strange feeling that when Bjorkstrand enters the AHL, he tears through it and makes it to the NHL about halfway through the season, and stays."
BlueJackets,3ajufo,WannabeFinn,4,Sat Jun 20 22:18:03 2015 UTC,We're not getting Hanifin. But securing Provorov...please?
BlueJackets,3ajufo,ScarletWitch65,8,Sat Jun 20 22:36:12 2015 UTC,I kinda like the suggestions of 6th + Merrill for 8th + Rychel. Essentially secures a top player (if not Provorov then 1 of Strome/Marner/Hanifin would slip to us) and gives us an NHL defenseman who can help out right away.
BlueJackets,3ajufo,yankeesfan13,5,Sat Jun 20 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"I worry that whoever we trade will become a star player, but now I'm starting to accept that.

BlueJackets,3ajufo,notwhoithink,0,Sun Jun 21 14:32:47 2015 UTC,"Rychel is most likely to be traded. He's going to be a star. Not necessarily a super star or all star, but a star nonetheless. There's no way around that, we're just too stacked at forward."
BlueJackets,3ajufo,Marcalogy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:50:04 2015 UTC,"I'd hardly say it's guaranteed he's going to become a star. A lot of things have to happen, for better or worse, between now and the day that we can truly judge Rychel's career.  But yes, as far as balancing expendability and trade value is concerned, Rychel is the top trade chip for us."
BlueJackets,3ajufo,UrinalPies,3,Sun Jun 21 00:58:26 2015 UTC,"I'd do it. Not because it's worth trading Rychel to get Provorov instead of Werenski (I personally don't mind either and think Werenski is slightly better), but because we would get Merrill, who is definitely the kind of player we need in our team.  That being said, I don't think New Jersey is willing to do it, and surely, they will ask for a 2nd round pick in addition to that... at least."
BlueJackets,3ajufo,HermanBonJovi,2,Sun Jun 21 05:07:22 2015 UTC,"Admittedly I've never really watched Merrill play but his stats are less than ideal through a pretty decent sample size. Might be a better investment in the long run to pay more for Severson, if NJ is willing to give him up."

BlueJackets,3af8bi,Logosmonkey,3,Fri Jun 19 17:24:46 2015 UTC,"I suspect we'll be packaging some of them for a trade up or veteran defenseman. We need blueline for the next 2-5 years, not in 5+."

BlueJackets,3af8bi,Logosmonkey,0,Fri Jun 19 22:08:10 2015 UTC,I think we should try to get Toronto to give us their 4th for our 8th and a second .. maybe a third? See if we can't get Hanifan. I suspect Arizona will take Strom anyway.
BlueJackets,3af8bi,yankeesfan13,4,Fri Jun 19 23:46:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert so I could be wrong, but I don't see any way Toronto would take that, even for the 2nd round pick. It would probably take multiple of them. Then again, I could be way off."
BlueJackets,3af8bi,Logosmonkey,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:15:49 2015 UTC,"I listen to entirely too much nhl network radio :) Anyway, one of the reporters from the Toronto Star was talking about it. He has heard rumblings that Toronto is working to trade off their pick for a lower pick and some additional options. I think you are probably right, we would have to give up some additional picks.   Basically, at this point Toronto is in full on rebuild with no chance at the playoffs for at least 3-5 years. They need bodies and this is a deep draft to get them in. They have previously traded away a number of their picks from this draft (I think we actually have one or two) and could use them back to start building up their depth charts."
BlueJackets,3af8bi,THECapedCaper,3,Sat Jun 20 13:18:16 2015 UTC,"Toronto is trying to get overpaid for all their assets, I don't think anything huge will be coming their way."

Its a 2012 Mazda 6 (with basically no options lol).  As a side note my current car insurance company (the company that had my old car under my parents name and insurance) wants $120/mo for that but Geico/Progressive says they can do the same coverage for $47? Is there something I'm missing here? Why wouldn't I just change to the cheaper company?  EDIT: Here is the car!
BlueJackets,3aepxv,HORSEtheGAME,5,Fri Jun 19 15:01:58 2015 UTC,Yay new car! How do you like it? Do you have a pic?

BlueJackets,3aepxv,HORSEtheGAME,5,Fri Jun 19 15:10:29 2015 UTC,"there isn't nay reason not to change. Who are you with currently? Also, the 47 bucks a month is pretty low.. is that for full coverage or just liability? If you financed your vehicle you have to keep full coverage. I would also suspect the Geico coverage has a really high deductible."
BlueJackets,3aepxv,Logosmonkey,3,Fri Jun 19 15:06:46 2015 UTC,I used their online calculator and specified that it is a financed car so I'm assuming that it includes that when giving a quote. Currently at MetLife I have a $300 deductible but it would seem that I can get a $100 deductible at the bigger companies for ~$49? I'll call Geico or Progressive tonight to verify. It just seems so odd..
BlueJackets,3aepxv,HORSEtheGAME,4,Fri Jun 19 15:11:42 2015 UTC,Insurance rarely makes sense. :)
BlueJackets,3aepxv,Logosmonkey,5,Fri Jun 19 15:17:40 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, work at insurance company. It's the actuary's fault, I swear they just make up numbers."
BlueJackets,3aepxv,AutomatonFood,3,Fri Jun 19 17:00:21 2015 UTC,"$120/mo for that but Geico/Progressive says they can do the same coverage for $47? Is there something I'm missing here? Why wouldn't I just change to the cheaper company?   I agree with /u/logosmonkey, insurance rarely makes sense. That's quite a price difference and I would not be surprised if it's accurate ...... But ..... Before you switch though just make sure the coverages, deductibles, and add-ons (like rental car coverage, roadside assistance, etc) are all the same so you're ""comparing apples-to-apples.""    (And if you haven't done so I'd also recommend looking at Erie insurance as well.) I switched to them, from Nationwide, have the exact same coverages and am saving about 30%.  I've also had 1 claim (someone backed into my parked car) and they were easy-peasy to deal with."

BlueJackets,3aat94,Goldenredhorse,3,Thu Jun 18 16:24:07 2015 UTC,This might answer all your questions regarding the system and the loophole for college draftees.
BlueJackets,3aat94,SomeKindOfMonster,3,Thu Jun 18 16:35:06 2015 UTC,"Being drafted =/= being a professional. As long as a prospect hasn't signed a contract, they are still considered an amateur and retain their NCAA eligibility."
BlueJackets,3aat94,WannabeFinn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:27:52 2015 UTC,"I still don't get it. So he's drafted to the CBJ, but not actually on the team? Could CBJ call him up to play? If not, why would the guy enter the draft? Why not just play college hockey and then enter the draft when he's done?"
BlueJackets,3aat94,WannabeFinn,7,Thu Jun 18 19:06:33 2015 UTC,"His contract rights belong to the CBJ after he was drafted. CBJ could not call him up to play until he signs a contract, at which point he would forfeit any remaining NCAA eligibility. I'm also quite sure that you don't ""enter"" the NHL draft. Anyone who is of age can be drafted. Simply put these players determine what route is best for their development, whether that's CHL, USHL, NCAA, etc. and they go to work and pray that they improve. For a lot of these guys it's a question of if they'll ever even get drafted, not ""when and where"". Some of these guys get drafted and don't even realize it til a day or two later when they get a phone call.  Basically, Reilly went to college because he felt he could become the best player he could be there. Columbus, feeling the same way, drafted him in order to possess negotiation rights when the day comes that he is ready for a professional contract. Reilly, of course, is and was allowed to turn away any contract offers in order to stay in the NCAA (to seek out a national championship) despite arguably being NHL ready. Now he has decided to leave the NCAA, after failing to win a championship, but his rights have also expired despite efforts from Columbus to negotiate a contract. He doesn't re-enter the draft because he is now too old (above the age of 20) and this places him in the professional hockey world as an unrestricted free agent."
BlueJackets,3aat94,notwhoithink,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:29:36 2015 UTC,"Excellent summary, thank you."
BlueJackets,3aat94,notwhoithink,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:05:16 2015 UTC,"Most of the younger players are drafted before they go pro. They w will end up playing a season or two in juniors or college, and if it looks like they might pan out then the team will try to get them to sign a contract. Once they have signed they cannot play in the NCAA, but they can still play in the junior leagues.  But no, the team cannot call him up to play until he has signed a contract. Until then they only own his rights, preventing him from going to another team.  The advantage of being drafted (for most players who are not immediately going pro) is that they have a shot at turning pro. They also get to attend prospect/development camps run by the pro teams to help them get better at playing. They will also get additional suggestions and coaching from the team on training, etc. So basically they enter the draft to either go pro or to get a leg up in their development with the intent of going pro in a couple of years.  As far as waiting until you're done playing college hockey before entering the draft, it's possible that you may not get drafted if you wait. You could end up being a bust before you ever play a pro game, even in the minors. You could have a career ending injury. You also miss out on all of the pro development help that could keep you from being a bust. Then there's the ego piece of it."

He got replaced by a 40 year old who only played the last quarter of the season due to blood clots and another 23 year old who injured his knee and came into the finals cold after missing most of the season. TONS of mental mistakes in the hawks zone.
BlueJackets,3aalrr,sgt_narkstick,4,Thu Jun 18 22:36:48 2015 UTC,"Timonen is a pretty good player, I wouldn't fault anyone who got benched for him.   Rundblad played two games against Tampa Bay in the SCF, where you claim he performed poorly and got replaced by Timonen. In both games he was given minimal 5v5 ice time but whenever he was on the ice the Blackhawks had a higher % of scoring chances, overall he had a positive effect on shot attempt %, he had a very positive effect on goals for %, and in two games combined he had 1 giveaway.   Don't put too much stock into how Quenneville plays his defense. He never played Nick Leddy all that much and look what he turned in to. He never played Dustin Byflugien that much and look what he turned in to. He didn't play Wiz much and Wiz was great for us, whether people are willing to believe it or not.  I'm not saying that Rundblad will turn in to any of those players, but it's silly to assume that he can't help us simply because he wasn't given the chance to help the Blackhawks that much.   He's a young defensemen that is most likely better than all of our defenders except Murray and maybe Goloubef (yes this includes Connauton and Savard and everyone else).  He can help out this team."

We went through ""hey we're playing CBJ, it's point night."" to "" Aw fuck not CBJ again."" That's how we like it. I say bring em all on. All you have to do is make the playoffs after that anything can happen."

It's a fast growing city for a reason, and even if it wasn't I'll never understand what people get from comments like ""well, at least we don't live in Ohio!"" when they lose to us.

After his contract negotiations last year I think a lot of the fan base was a little unsure about his feelings toward CBJ. Following the All Star Weekend, and his presence with the media, I don't think there's anyone who doesn't love him around Columbus.   I'm glad to see this kind of tweet from the team, and it came from the right person. I wouldn't want to see this from Foligno. This is kind of like the Black Hawks Kane/Toews relationship. A couple All Stars who bring different things to the table."

How quickly we forget..."
BlueJackets,3a79ca,AKlep,3,Thu Jun 18 09:46:05 2015 UTC,Johansen never said he didn't want to be here. He stated publicly that he wanted to be here long term and that it was killing him not being able to practice with his teammates. That's probably why his deal got done before opening day.
BlueJackets,3a79ca,notwhoithink,0,Thu Jun 18 13:40:31 2015 UTC,"He never said it and I never doubted it, but plenty of people in the sign took his refusal to sign whatever they put in front of him as him not wanting to be here.  Regardless, the attitude was ""if he won't sign, fuck him""."
BlueJackets,3a79ca,AKlep,2,Thu Jun 18 14:04:17 2015 UTC,"It was strictly a money matter. He wanted to be here and made that known. IIRC, most people here were mad at his agent, rather than Johansen."
BlueJackets,3a79ca,Swabeky,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:30:39 2015 UTC,"can confirm, once details of the negotiations leaked I think everyones tune was fuck RyJo's agent.  After this year I say show him the money but after last season?  I was honestly worried that he was going to regress."
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,SomeKindOfMonster,37,Wed Jun 17 18:01:28 2015 UTC,I hope he goes to a team where he starts on the 3rd line next season and he runs into Prout during our game and gets leveled.

BlueJackets,3a6t9v,triforce28,16,Wed Jun 17 18:30:48 2015 UTC,Any player who refuses to sign with the team who drafted him is a fucking asshole. Yeah it's technically allowed but if every player does it then there's no reason to even have the draft since players will just sign with the top teams and the bottom teams in the league will stay bad forever. He's helping set a shitty fucking precedent with his douchebaggery.
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,TheZiggurat614,0,Wed Jun 17 18:40:06 2015 UTC,That guy has had a hard on for Mike Reilly since the start of this. Reilly is an asshole and so is that poster

BlueJackets,3a6t9v,Aperture-Employee,-11,Wed Jun 17 21:41:53 2015 UTC,"Buy that same logic, any team that fails to offer a contract to a player that they drafted is an asshole. Oh wait...that happens all of the time and nobody cares. And lets be honest, if it didn't seem like Reilly was going to be a stud defenseman them nobody would care about him either. The CBJ owned his rights for three seasons, not for his entire life.   Nobody told the CBJ to draft him. They chose to. They knew that he could eventually end up not signing with them, just like Reilly knew that there was a chance that the team wouldn't even offer him a contract. That's just business, and everyone acting all butthurt and insulted because a player chose to sign with someone else in free agency needs their head examined."
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,notwhoithink,15,Wed Jun 17 18:46:59 2015 UTC,"He refused to come play for the Jackets, just like Hayes refused to sign with the Hawks. The team didn't ""fail to offer a contract"" to him, they drafted him and have been wanting to sign him for a while now and he declined because he doesn't want to play in Columbus. It's such a diva fucking move to pull. If Eichel did this same thing and ended up signing with Tampa after finishing school and refusing to play for Buffalo there would be an outrage. Same situation, just as 'legal' by the CBA but just with a bigger name."
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,Aperture-Employee,-9,Wed Jun 17 18:52:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my point wasn't that they didn't offer him a contract, because clearly they did. My point was that just because you draft someone doesn't mean that they will play for you. They may choose not to sign. The team may choose not to offer a contract. Nobody cares when the team doesn't want the player, but if the reverse is true the fans shoe up with torches and pitchforks. Is a ridiculous double standard."
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,notwhoithink,6,Wed Jun 17 19:03:01 2015 UTC,"How is it a double standard? A team not wanting a player isn't a big deal because there are so many reasons behind that: cap space, positions that the team needs, player performance, etc. If a player doesn't want a team, tough fucking shit you're supposed to be a fucking professional so suck it up and fucking play for the team that drafted you, don't refuse to sign with them and wait until you can play somewhere that you want to play."
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,notwhoithink,-7,Wed Jun 17 19:32:55 2015 UTC,"It's a double standard because the player and the team should be treated as equals. A drafted player is not a slave and there have been court cases and entire leagues (anyone remember the WHL) created over this fact. It's a double standard because of it is ok for the team to walk away once the rights expire, then it should be ok for the player to do the same."
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,flyerfanatic93,10,Wed Jun 17 20:04:14 2015 UTC,And we can choose to think he's a fucking asshole for it.

BlueJackets,3a6t9v,Juicewag,-5,Wed Jun 17 21:25:03 2015 UTC,"Reason is always warranted. As far as downvotes go, most of the ""fans"" in this sub still don't understand that the downvote is not a ""disagree"" button.   As far as expectations go, we have had dozens of draft picks over the years who never played a single game for the CBJ. If that is your expectation then you need an education as to how the system works."

Maybe in your short time on Reddit you haven't realized that many people will use the downvote button as a disagree button. I have tried to preach that it is not but it will always be an uphill battle.  And as far as expectations go, this is obviously an extraordinary case, otherwise this thread wouldn't have as many comments as it does here and on r/hockey. Maybe YOU need an education as to how the system, and Reddit works."
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,NLP19,-2,Wed Jun 17 22:20:25 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me? Now you're questioning the fandom of those in our community?    Fandom?  No.  They are without a doubt some of the most passionate fans in the NHL.  The problem is that their passion is frequently upstaged by their ignorance.  It's not their fault that most of them don't know any better.  They were raised up with OSU football, and with the exception of a few transplants from other hockey markets most of them are really out to lunch about hockey and the NHL.  If you doubt me, just go to some games at NWA and listen to the conversations in the stands around you.  I've been to over 400 games at NWA and I can't recall a single time that I was there that I didn't hear some ""fan"" passionately talking out their ass about something that they didn't understand.  I once got into an argument with another CBJ ""fan"" (though clearly not a hockey fan) about whether a puck that was clrearly batted into the net with a players hand was a good goal or not.  (BTW, in case you are unsure it's not actually a goal in that case.)  Yeah, they're passionate.  Just not well informed."

BlueJackets,3a6t9v,TheDoubleL27,9,Wed Jun 17 18:39:47 2015 UTC,The NHL needs to make it so that draft picks can only be signed by the teams that drafted them. It's ridiculous that he played the system this much and we get nothing.

We just spent however many days and dollars using our staff and resources to help his development over the past several years and believe in him, only to be dicked over. It's such a selfish move by him to not play for the team that drafted him, can offer him a roster spot, and a max contract."
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,Juicewag,-16,Wed Jun 17 18:06:02 2015 UTC,"It's not a broken system. The CBA was written that way on purpose. Those are the risks of drafting kids at 16 or 17 years old.  As to what we can offer him, can we offer him a realistic chance to play for the cup next season? There's a whole lot of teams that can."
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,triforce28,7,Wed Jun 17 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"We're really the only professional sports league that has this issue though, if I'm not mistaken. Any other league you get some form of pick compensation."

BlueJackets,3a6t9v,IAmAChemicalEngineer,2,Wed Jun 17 22:29:33 2015 UTC,Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck...
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,HermanBonJovi,2,Wed Jun 17 18:09:16 2015 UTC,May Mike Reilly be plagued by dull skates and broken sticks. Jerkface.
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,justthetip751,2,Wed Jun 17 18:47:52 2015 UTC,I wonder what font I should use when making a Mike Reilly Sucks poster when he plays us.
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,Jarg1623,3,Wed Jun 17 20:14:42 2015 UTC,Comic Sans
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,Swabeky,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:47:36 2015 UTC,maybe wing dings
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,Jarg1623,2,Fri Jun 19 12:00:52 2015 UTC,We don't need that cake eater anyway. Hope he busts big time.
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,Swabeky,2,Wed Jun 17 20:18:57 2015 UTC,And now I suspect we'll see either a trade at the draft for an NHL-ready defenseman or we will try to trade up to go after a high-ranked D-man at the draft. Or both.
BlueJackets,3a6t9v,Jarg1623,2,Wed Jun 17 20:30:35 2015 UTC,lol. His loss. Fuck 'em.
BlueJackets,3a7db4,Swabeky,5,Wed Jun 17 20:22:05 2015 UTC,"Is it really hard to find the value in a defender that can pass the puck? Good passing from defenders leads to far less dump ins, it spreads out the ice, and it allows for cleaner/more efficient neutral zone play. Also, a defender that consistently has the puck is valuable because if your team always has the puck it's pretty hard to score against you."
BlueJackets,3a7db4,UrinalPies,2,Thu Jun 18 01:22:04 2015 UTC,This. Sure our current d-men might be prone to breakdowns in the defensive zone but most of the time it's because they can't make fucking passes.
BlueJackets,3a7db4,Pyzorz,2,Thu Jun 18 02:41:19 2015 UTC,"Yea but we already have 3 of those, maybe 4.  Murray, Savard, Johnson and Maybe Connauton qualify.   Our possesion numbers will get better with our offense being healthy but I believe the biggest help will be someone who can cover Johnson or Connauton when they step up or make a mental blunder in our zone.  Johnson and Connauton are liable to have plenty of those.   /armchairgmmode"
BlueJackets,3a7db4,knukklez,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:52:05 2015 UTC,I think Connauton has more things to worry about than puck movement. My biggest complaint about his game is how many times he gets blown by on the boards by a winger. I think he really needs to work on his speed and angling/stick work in order to prevent forwards from taking advantage of him.
BlueJackets,3a7db4,XdefeatsY,2,Thu Jun 18 14:53:39 2015 UTC,I agree with you as well. I know HCTR likes his D-men to have an offensive touch but that's why there are forwards.
BlueJackets,3a7db4,UrinalPies,3,Wed Jun 17 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"Using the same logic, we can say that we really don't need players that are good at defending because ""that's why there are goalies.""  Edit: also, the objective of having defenders that are offensively minded is that they can help out the forwards, just like 2-way forwards are valuable because they can help out the defense."
BlueJackets,3a7db4,knukklez,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:18:09 2015 UTC,"just like 2-way forwards are valuable   Right, that's why Center is such a tough position. It's a whole different mindset than being a winger."
BlueJackets,3a7db4,knukklez,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:57:10 2015 UTC,"We're a very gritty team that grinds out dirty goals in the crease. We need our defensemen to be able to identify shooting lanes and zip pucks hard and low into the net so that Foligno and Hartnell, et. al. can finish 'em off."
BlueJackets,3a7db4,flyerfanatic93,2,Thu Jun 18 14:55:40 2015 UTC,I pretty much agree with everything you just said. We need a shutdown D man
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,Minnesota_MiracleMan,6,Wed Jun 17 17:43:02 2015 UTC,"Not really interested. We have a much more urgent need on the blueline, and I don't think we need a LW enough to give up what they are going to ask in return.   He's also got a pretty short contract left and is not getting younger. His best years are behind him."
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,Drithyin,0,Wed Jun 17 18:10:16 2015 UTC,Maybe Seabrook then?
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,f4ze,-12,Wed Jun 17 22:00:34 2015 UTC,If CBJ is looking to seriously compete next year... I would say he's a great guy to target.  But I get the sense that isn't the plan here in CBJ just yet.
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,GeekYogurt,12,Wed Jun 17 18:12:45 2015 UTC,It is most definitely the plan to compete for a cup next year.
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,UrinalPies,6,Wed Jun 17 18:38:40 2015 UTC,He's an old winger that's getting worse. Seems careless to waste the future on him
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,Juicewag,3,Wed Jun 17 18:15:38 2015 UTC,Did you watch the last 20 games of the season? We WILL compete next season and we WILL go far.
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,DudeitsJonas,3,Wed Jun 17 20:45:18 2015 UTC,lol In what universe do you think telling a fan base their team has no interest in winning is a smart thing to do? GTFO.
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,knukklez,-3,Wed Jun 17 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"As in put you guys over the top, yes. You guys have a great team. I may even say better than the Caps. But there are much better teams out there."
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,HardKnockRiffe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:28:10 2015 UTC,You may be in for a surprise next year. Would you like to do a flair bet or some other kind of wager?
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,HardKnockRiffe,2,Thu Jun 18 15:02:45 2015 UTC,"No, because I think the Jackets will be better than the Caps, at least in the regular season.  Not to be a debbie downer on the Caps, but I see the division shaking out as NYI - NYR - CBJ and then us and Pit nabbing WC. TB-MTL-DET on other side."
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,stolpoz,2,Thu Jun 18 15:16:13 2015 UTC,"Is it being talked about? No. Would we be interested? Maybe. LW isn't a huge need for us, really. That's not to say we wouldn't want a guy like Sharp, but I don't think we'd be actively trying to get him. Our situation at RW, on the other hand, is abysmal."
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,Swabeky,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:48:28 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that Sharp could play both Wings... but maybe I am wrong.  Just seems like a good fit. Most teams people consider in it for Sharp have Cap Issues and if they don't, they don't have what is needed to get Sharp. I don't know about the pieces needed part for CBJ, but they certainly have the Cap Space and flexibility for this coming year and probably next year."
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,HardKnockRiffe,2,Wed Jun 17 17:51:55 2015 UTC,"He might be able to play RW; but would he be able to be a 45-60 point scorer over there like he is on the left? Maybe, maybe not. He is a right-handed shot, so that would make the transition a little bit easier. Perhaps he can play LW and we move someone to RW.   The thing that might concern me most is what we'd have to give up to get him. We've got a lot of good, young talent at C and D in the AHL, but what and who would we have to give up in order to land a guy like Sharp? The other thing is that he only has two years left on his contract, so unless he's willing to restructure to a long-term deal, I don't think it'd be worth it."
BlueJackets,3a6qk8,AutomatonFood,-1,Wed Jun 17 17:58:54 2015 UTC,"I know a guy who can play RW, scored 30+ goals on multiple occasions AND would thrive in columbus (maybe) For just your 8th overall (and a prospect, possible a second too)  Phil, the thrill, KESSEL"

BlueJackets,3a23f9,HermanBonJovi,6,Thu Jun 18 15:50:51 2015 UTC,"Remember, these are not the statistical probabilities that a given team will win the cup, just the betting odds which is based on a number of factors, including number of people making the bets.

BlueJackets,3a23f9,Lyun,5,Tue Jun 16 17:42:26 2015 UTC,"Man, I wouldn't put any stock into this. These odds make no sense. In what world do the Leafs have the same chances as the Stars going into next year? And Florida below both? And the Senators below the Sharks? And the Bruins as high as they are? And of course, the Oilers making that large of a jump? I get it, I personally think they'll be a bubble team next year, but to say they're equal to us or Detroit in terms of competitiveness is sort of wishful thinking.  I prefer the Bleacher Report list."

I didn't want to spend the last several months talking shit about a player that might still sign with Columbus. So I'll hold off until he actually signs with someone else."
BlueJackets,3a19ba,insomnyuk,3,Tue Jun 16 17:07:33 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you. But it still sucks a lot and he's an easy target. If I had the chance to go be a UFA, I'd probably take it too."

He won't be able to stay on the team due to cap issues, so I'll also be missing him soon enough.   It's easy to hate on the Hawks, but on the other side I've adored your team's attitude, grit, and discipline since I saw your squad kick into another gear last playoffs. You see so many teams that  lack that level of heart that are rated higher than the Blue Jackets. Your team actually deserves it.

BlueJackets,39unce,UrinalPies,3,Mon Jun 15 02:48:30 2015 UTC,Because Jenner is pretty much this team's identity.
BlueJackets,39unce,lmcm15,3,Mon Jun 15 10:31:50 2015 UTC,"so is Dubinsky, and Foligno, and Calvert, and Hartnell, and everyone else.

BlueJackets,39unce,UrinalPies,2,Mon Jun 15 18:18:05 2015 UTC,I would love to have Dougie but I think we have so many other players that we would trade before we would trade Boone.  Side note: Do you think Dougie will be offer sheeted to screw over the Bruins?
BlueJackets,39unce,infiniteshadow,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"that's not really the point. If Boston calls Jarmo up and says ""hey how does Boone for Dougie sound"" do you really want Jarmo to say ""well, we aren't really willing to deal with this replaceable center, how about we try...""?  Boone for Dougie is an absolute steal.   And there's been talk about more offer sheets recently, mostly out of Buffalo. It's gonna take a GM with some guts to do it, but I personally think Dougie (and other players out there) are worth it.  Edit: word"
BlueJackets,39unce,UrinalPies,5,Tue Jun 16 05:26:37 2015 UTC,"Identity? Like, a hockey player that scores goals, works hard, and gets injured sometimes?"

When he's in we are much better, and we are flushed with prospects we could package to get it done. As Jarmo said, he's got more forwards than he can play, so someone's gotta go. I don't see this trade happening at all."

Milano and Rychel are young and unproven. Boone is young and proven and can play wing or center at a high level. If someone told me I could trade Milano, Rychel, and Anisimov for Boone, I would do it. I wasn't saying that we should trade those three for Hamilton though. I was saying that those are pieces we should consider moving, not Boone."

BlueJackets,39unce,UrinalPies,15,Mon Jun 15 17:50:35 2015 UTC,The comments in this thread are hilarious.  Dougie Hamilton is the best young defender in the game and getting him for Boone is an absolute underpayment.
BlueJackets,39unce,WannabeFinn,5,Mon Jun 15 02:52:48 2015 UTC,"Best young defender in the game? Bit of a stretch there, lol..   Ekblad, Faulk, Jones, Lindholm, Leddy? Are we forgetting about these guys just because Hamilton had a good offensive season?  Don't get me wrong, I like Dougie and I think he'll be a great top 4 or even top pairing RHD in this league but he's not THE best young defender in this league. It also seems like he's about to command a ludicrous salary for someone his age."

BlueJackets,39unce,UrinalPies,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:53:41 2015 UTC,"I would really love to argue with you about pointless semantics, but let me ask you this: does considering Dougie the best or third best young defender actually change the value of him for the blue jackets? If given the opportunity we should trade Boone for him, just like we should trade Boone for Ekblad or Leddy or Josi or Doughty or Subban.  I deeply apologize if my deeming Hamilton the best young defender in the game offended you."

BlueJackets,39unce,UrinalPies,2,Tue Jun 16 05:35:45 2015 UTC,"that's... not the point. The topic of discussion wasn't ""should the jackets trade Boone for the best young defender or the third best young defender,"" it was ""should the jackets trade Boone for Hamilton,"" in which the response should be (whether you consider Hamilton the third best or the best) a yes.  and for whatever it's worth, people IRL tell me that condescension really goes well with skin tone and brings out my eyes."
BlueJackets,39unce,Kidparkinsons,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:52:08 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way:  For me, there are only 7 defensemen that I would choose to build a franchise around before Hamilton: Weber, Doughty, Subban, Karlsson, Keith, Ekman-Larsson, and Hedman.  For Boone, there are players on the Blue Jackets that I would choose to build a Franchise around before Boone, namely Johansen. Take the whole league into account, and there are strong candidates on every team."
BlueJackets,39unce,WannabeFinn,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"My comment above has nothing to do with Boone or a trade involving Boone and Dougie. It merely was addressing the statement that referred to Dougie as the best young defenseman in the league, which I find to be incorrect.  You wouldn't build around Ekblad? The 18 year old who put up 39 points and played like a #1 D on a non-playoff team? You wouldn't build around Roman Josi, Weber's pairing partner who arguably was the better of the two this past year and only turned 25 two weeks ago? Alex Pietrangelo, the stud defenseman on a perennial contender and Canadian Olympian? What about McDonagh, Shattenkirk, Faulk, Lindholm, Leddy, Suter.."
BlueJackets,39unce,Kidparkinsons,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"maybe Ekblad because of how young he is, and maybe McDonagh or Pietrangelo. Of all the other ones, I think Hamilton is better, and I think his age might put him slightly above Pietrangelo, McDonagh and Josi. factor in Contracts, and I would much rather take McDonagh or Josi. And I would definitely take Shattenkirk over Hamilton. Didn't realize how good his numbers were because he is/was playing behind Pietrangelo and Bouwmeester."
BlueJackets,39unce,WannabeFinn,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:10:32 2015 UTC,"I really don't see any potential justification for 'maybe' in this situation when it comes to McDonagh, Pietrangelo, or Josi. They are incredibly more proven and successful than Hamilton."
BlueJackets,39unce,logicoLe,4,Mon Jun 15 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"Hey. I agree with you. I'm not trying to be flippant with the idea of trading Jenner.

Hamilton isn't a commodity to be taken lightly. I'd take him at a high cost."

BlueJackets,39unce,AKlep,3,Mon Jun 15 00:04:41 2015 UTC,"We'd probably have to give up a little more than Rychel, but I agree. We should try to acquire him using other pieces, not Boone."

BlueJackets,39unce,CamRam26,-2,Mon Jun 15 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong points are great especially for a defenseman, but when being a defenseman, you have to worry about this little thing called ""defense"" and he's been mediocre at best especially as a first round talent. We had Wisniewski that scored a lot, but couldn't play defense. If Dougie can develop his defensive game, along with that scoring touch, then I would think about the trade. But Jenner is the more reliable player at the moment. You know what you get from him, and both sides of the ice. Just not so sure about Dougie yet."
BlueJackets,39unce,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:17:29 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if you've ever actually watched Hamilton play -- he's not a powerplay/3rd line kid. He's Boston's replacement for Chara. He will be playing top pair minutes next season unless he lands somewhere like Nashville or Calgary.
BlueJackets,39unce,Kidparkinsons,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:17:25 2015 UTC,"HERO charts here show he is top pairing in every category except TOI. Jenner is 2nd line in all the categories.

BlueJackets,39unce,UrinalPies,4,Mon Jun 15 03:54:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   Oh, and:   We had Wisniewski that scored a lot, but couldn't play defense    Using the same charts show that Wiz was a great offensive player and a 2nd pair defensive player.

This is actually a pretty good discussion.  Like everyone else what we want is a defenseman - preferably on the younger side. Dumoulin sounds pretty good without knowing anything else about him. If he is as good as you imply a 1 for 1 trade doesn't sound too far off.  EDIT: Some more information about this prospet:   Dumoulin is a big, talented defensemen and was part of two national championships at the college level. He possesses the smooth skating stride of a player much smaller than his size. He is not overly combative but possesses the strength, size, and balance to keep the front of the net clear of traffic. He is also an adept puck-mover with a hard point shot. Supremely confident on and off the ice, Dumoulin possesses numerous traits which suggest he could develop into a reliable top-four defenseman in the NHL, most notably his ability to quickly retrieve the puck and move it up ice.  ...  He is the second-leading scorer amongst defensemen for Wilkes-Barre/Scranton [...]   Dumoulin is 23 years old  from here http://www.hockeysfuture.com/prospects/brian_dumoulin/"

BlueJackets,39lrz5,DriArcher,2,Fri Jun 12 23:54:30 2015 UTC,This seems like the consensus among CBJ fans and realistically could happen in the next couple weeks when trading opens up.
BlueJackets,39lrz5,XdefeatsY,5,Fri Jun 12 18:37:30 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that if we trade Rychel for anything it will be for a solid, proven D-man. I never really entertained the idea of Ben Lovejoy until I read this. He seems like the kind of guy we could use; that and he knows Coach Richards from when he coached the WBS Pens which never hurts. Dumoulin is younger but shows a lot of promise and has good hockey IQ. If it was up to me, I would definitely be considering it."
BlueJackets,39lrz5,SomeKindOfMonster,4,Fri Jun 12 17:35:41 2015 UTC,Those are great points. Plus he's like the most likable guy ever.
BlueJackets,39lrz5,UrinalPies,3,Fri Jun 12 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"Bennett is the only forward even close to interesting but trading for him is essentially just adding 3 years to Rychel, so that seems kinda pointless.  Lovejoy is very not good but I do think the Jackets are looking to get a young, puck moving defender like Dumoulin so there may be interest there."
BlueJackets,39lrz5,Logosmonkey,3,Fri Jun 12 17:59:42 2015 UTC,Lovejoy and Dumoulin are both interesting offers. I could see something like that happening.   Where do you think you guys would play Rychel?
BlueJackets,39lrz5,Logosmonkey,3,Fri Jun 12 19:09:43 2015 UTC,LW next to Malkin is what's being talked about.
BlueJackets,39lrz5,Swabeky,3,Fri Jun 12 19:11:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I could see that."
BlueJackets,39lrz5,notwhoithink,3,Fri Jun 12 19:13:14 2015 UTC,"As everyone else seems to be saying Dumoulin would be a nice swap but Harrington might be the one that would fit better.  We have a ton of OFD: Murray, Connauton, Johnson and Savard can all move the puck pretty well and are decent at stepping up into the play.  Perhaps Harrington would be a Methot type that would help spring guys like Johnson or Connauton, letting them make Offensive plays, while not worrying about no one covering.  I watched a decent amount of Sens games last year and Karlsson was a different player with Methot.  We need DEFENSE more than OFFENSE with the D-player we get because we look terrible most of the time in our own end.  just my $0.02."
BlueJackets,39lrz5,THECapedCaper,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:23:10 2015 UTC,This is true. Harrington is projected to be a Paul Martin type player.
BlueJackets,39lrz5,HermanBonJovi,3,Fri Jun 12 19:39:59 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go with ""none of the above"". Trading within the division is dangerous. Rychel is a guy who will score a lot of goals. I don't want him scoring them against the CBJ. Even an outstanding defenseman will by nature not be as visible as a good forward, so even if we ""break even"" in the trade it will look like we lost on it."
BlueJackets,39lrz5,Drithyin,3,Sat Jun 13 11:25:34 2015 UTC,"I'd rather not trade within the division, but then I look at the stacked defensive prospects the Devils and possibly the Canes have, realize that Rychel isn't going to make them into playoff contenders overnight, and realize that they would make good trading partners. I wouldn't want to help Pittsburgh in any way unless I got the better end of the deal simply because of Crosby and Malkin carrying them."
BlueJackets,39lrz5,nunoveaux,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:03:16 2015 UTC,"The Devils are a good 2-5 years from being a real playoff threat, right now.  Unless something goes insane at the draft.  Plus id rather Rychel go to my Devils than to a team i hate."
BlueJackets,39lrz5,SaucyMittsChris,2,Sun Jun 14 13:13:00 2015 UTC,"I've not seen a second of Dumoulin on the ice, but if he's got as much potential as your indicate, I could see him and a pick (maybe a 3rd or a 2nd if we toss in a lower pick to make it a player-for-play plus pick-upgrade).   There's been a lot of activity around the trade market for K. Rychel, so I wouldn't be surprised if he goes for a little more than normal."
BlueJackets,39lrz5,307x,2,Fri Jun 12 19:07:24 2015 UTC,"Good discourse,  But there's no way in hell I want to see Rychel for the next decade as long as we are division rivals."
BlueJackets,39lrz5,SexyOmlet,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:11:34 2015 UTC,"Defense needs to be addressed our top 6 forwards are very solid so in my mind, Defense is the only option. Which leaves Dumoulin, Harrington, Lovejoy, and Scuderi.   We have a veteran presence on D in the likes of Jack J and Tyutin granted they haven't won it all, but they've been around. So Scuderi I wouldn't take. Lovejoy is a reliable player but we need someone young, unproven, and hungry to develop and keep around for a long time. So he's out in my book as well.  So that leaves the 2 rooks and I'm gonna go with Dumoulin over Harrington. It's virtually a toss up between those two though. Dumoulin is a slightly bigger and it never hurts to have size and reach on D so that's my pick."
BlueJackets,39lrz5,nunoveaux,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:37:24 2015 UTC,"dumoulin is the best of these options... bennett is intriguing but the injury history troubles me, plus he wasn't ""put in a position to fail"" - he had stints with both crosby and malkin. bylsma did screw around with him, though. - sutter sucks, scuderi sucks, lovejoy sucks, spaling sucks. all 4th line/#6 dman talent"

My understanding was the City of Columbus bailed out the arena and assumed a great deal of the debt that was causing the Jackets to be in contention to be a team on the moving chopping block.  And I think I heard that Nationwide actually owns the bonds on the Arena, so now essentially makes money on the debt that the city assumed."
BlueJackets,39jqnt,buckeye_baker,2,Fri Jun 12 12:22:42 2015 UTC,"You are correct, part of the problem with the original lease is that Nationwide owned the building and therefore did not pay for naming rights which lead to a lease that was slowly bankrupting the team.

Just like I find it annoying when people try to start the OH-IO chant at a CBJ game. Both are really cool in their own settings but they feel really out of place at a CBJ game.  For the record I love the Buckeyes and while I'm not a huge soccer fan I do support the Crew and enjoy going to a few games a summer.

BlueJackets,391pl9,kevler9oh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:14:39 2015 UTC,Here is the simple answer for you. The CBJ was the little brother that big OHIO State never wanted and in fact went out of their way to spend millions of dollars to have the city vote down any chance to get the arena. So when when I hear an OH-IO chant in that arena makes me cringe to remember a time when Columbus only cared about the Buckeyes.

It was dirty as hell and never sold out, but the fans that did show up on a regular basis were really into it, and the place had a filthy yet amazing atmosphere to it that I don't think the new Huntington Center will ever be able recreate.  It may have been it's time to go, but I'll never forget the Sports Arena, it was an amazing place to grow up watching minor league hockey."

Not to mention it's cheap, and great play.   The problem Cincinnati had this year was too many guys wanted to try and be danglers and took them half a season to work together."

BlueJackets,38wn23,HermanBonJovi,0,Mon Jun 15 10:36:32 2015 UTC,"I don't get how you think we would have to add a 4th to get your 8th if we are trading you Kessel. Kessel would make CBJ arguably the best team in the east just like that. You would jump from being a middle of the pack offensive team to one of the best in the league.   All you would be giving up in the deal OP offered is a prospect who could become really good, a top 10 pick who COULD become good, and a cap dump player who IS NOT good... and you would be getting back the 5th best scorer in the league for the last 5 years. So you're telling me you don't think having one of the best offensive players in the league is worth that much? Are you daft?"

BlueJackets,38nq7x,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:18:47 2015 UTC,We're using a platform called Titanium which is an MVC framework that lets you build apps like you would a webpage (xml/javascript/tss instead of html/javascript/css) and then compiles into java/objective c.  I'ts ok. It does certain things really well and has a pretty active developer community so its usually pretty easy to find answers to questions online. However some features feel really unfinished...

I really can't wait for next season though, so much to look forward to.   One thing I saw last season that I was impressed with that I haven't heard too much chatter about is RYJO, in respect to his change in play. I feel he's really taken on a role as being a member of a the team and facilitating scoring chances rather than going it alone. I think it says a lot about him especially with all the things swirling with his signing. Not that he wasn't a team player before but I really think he did a great job this past season."

My wife kept saying she thought he wasn't as good this year and I had to tell her like she was 5 there was more to hockey than scoring goals (sort of). I was very impressed by his puck facilitation and power play prowess. I hope he levels off next year and takes more shots but keeps his distribution up to a good team level.

But as in baseball, if he wants to play professionally he should have to re-enter the draft. It's not just unfair to CBJ, it's unfair to every single player who went to where they were drafted.  I also take exception with the insinuation this is somehow CBJ's fault for not being a good enough organization. It doesn't fucking matter!! It's the draft!! Where by design, even shitty (cough cough Edmonton) orgs get their fair shot at getting better. Anyway, by all accounts we've become a good org over the past couple years both on and off the ice. Not only that, again, does every drafted player get to play for ""the best organization""? Whatever that means... One 21 year old who sees they world as his oyster is not only going to biased in that decision, but ignorant.   He probably made this decision three years ago when he was drafted. What else does he want us to prove? We're a playoff team who needs his services and will pay him the max amount.   Fuck him."
BlueJackets,38fhtj,GeekYogurt,4,Thu Jun 4 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"The real kick in the balls is that if he were drafted in the 1st round, we would get a compensatory pick. But he developed into what some have said would be a lock 1st round pick this year."
BlueJackets,38fhtj,SomeKindOfMonster,3,Thu Jun 4 02:59:57 2015 UTC,"If he made the decision 3 years ago that he wasn't going to sign here then why is he continuing to tell the media that the CBJ are still in the race?   I understand not liking the rules, but getting mad at the player for taking absolute advantage of the opportunity before him is unfair.   No, most players don't get a chance to play for the ""best organization,"" is that supposed to make Reilly feel bad? Is he supposed to just not take the opportunity because nobody else gets it?  Your outrage towards Reilly is unwarranted. Take it up with the NHL, take it up with the Players Association, I don't care. But it's pointless to judge a kid's character because he's actually jumping on an opportunity that really nobody else gets."

What is the point of us drafting any of the young players if they can just go anywhere anyways?"
BlueJackets,38fhtj,Bubbz1211,15,Wed Jun 3 23:49:47 2015 UTC,It's almost a gamble when drafting an NCAA player. They could develop into one of the best players in the country at his position and choose not to sign and then have teams kissing your feet.   I'm more pissed about the system. It's kind of fucked.

BlueJackets,38fhtj,AKlep,5,Thu Jun 4 01:24:28 2015 UTC,"So again what's the point of any team ""drafting"" or having rights to a NCAA player if they don't really have rights and they can go wherever anyway? Just seems dumb to even go through the motions of drafting if they can go wherever they want regardless."
BlueJackets,38fhtj,Bubbz1211,5,Thu Jun 4 00:50:54 2015 UTC,"Here's a pretty in-depth read about it from when this happened with Anders Lee of the Islanders.  Edit: TL;DR: Here's one of the most important paragraphs to kind of summarize it.   So if you decide college isn't your thing anymore, the NHL says you still belong to your drafting team -- unless you've put in three years (for USHL or junior B-type players) or four years (for traditional college-bound draftees) without your drafting team coaxing you out of college already. I've always read that minor ""loophole"" as some sort of recognition for the fact that a prospect in his fourth June 1 since his draft has already given up some earning potential by pursuing his degree through age 21-23 instead of taking an ELC at age 18-20."

BlueJackets,38fhtj,flyerfanatic93,5,Thu Jun 4 00:43:04 2015 UTC,"Seems unfair to call out fans for being passionate about their team.  This organization needs to find some late round gems. So to me it doesn't seem so outlandish to be emotional when we finally  do find one and he doesn't end up playing for us.  It's the Internet, it's not like we're popping up in China to harass Mike Reilly.  I appreciate the off-season content, but I don't think they should be calling out fans for being passionate about their team."
BlueJackets,38fhtj,kowdijj,4,Thu Jun 4 03:53:16 2015 UTC,"No, he isn't, the league is.  This can't happen in any other league.  In the NFL and NBA, you own the rights to the player, period.  In baseball if you draft a high schooler and he goes to college, or if for some reason you can't sign any porspect, you get compensation.  And yet the NHL offers no such protection to the team.  Total BS"
BlueJackets,38fhtj,Greenlytrees,2,Thu Jun 4 02:52:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah this NHL system is fucked up. I mean, even in MLS, where they bend the rules to put a lot of big name players in the same 4 teams, everyone gets protection from draft snubs. Draft pick decides to say ""fuck you"" and goes to play in Norway's third division? Cool, you have 2 choices: keep his rights forever (unless you trade them) in case he comes back, or the league will give you Garber Bucks allocation money for the rights. You can use that money towards players or whatever, but then you don't get if if he come back."

Yes, this loophole could prevent a first round talent from coming to our team and that sucks, but the fact of the matter is, if he goes elsewhere, it only cost the Jackets a 4th round pick. It's not like the team wasted a high pick like they have on the past on busts like Brule, Filitov, and Picard.  I get it. We've all endured a lot of hardships cheering for this team for the last decade and a half when literally nothing goes our way, from the worst Draft Lottery luck imaginable, to stars like Carter and Nash pissing and moaning their way to different teams. But this kid is not Jeff Carter. He is within his right to make the best decision for him and good for him for doing so.  Whether or not he's on our roster next year, two things will stay the same: I'm pulling for the guys in our locker room with everything I've got, and rooting as hard as I can against any team that comes into NWA--with or without Reilly."
BlueJackets,38fhtj,mixquill,0,Thu Jun 4 13:05:22 2015 UTC,Why was it not in Carter's right? Nash's right?
BlueJackets,38fhtj,judgebread,2,Fri Jun 5 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"They had contracts. Reilly doesn't.   Not to mention, we gave up a lot more to get Carter (Voracek, 1st rounder) than a 4th round pick.   Yes, Carter was traded here against his will, but he could have given a little effort on the ice and at least tried to not be a locker room cancer. Those are the reasons why I hate Carter. I don't think that a kid that decided he wanted to go to college should get that same level of hate from our fanbase. He's not deliberately trying to screw the Jackets."
BlueJackets,38fhtj,mixquill,0,Fri Jun 5 12:33:11 2015 UTC,"If college was the main issue, then why isn't he still there? He didn't graduate.   Again, you hate Carter for taking advantage of his situation. He didn't have to play for a team he didn't want to stay on. He assessed the roster and deemed that it was garbage. He made the decision that he would be better served getting traded to another team (which worked out pretty well for him).  I'm just saying, if Reilly is absolved of any hate for making the decision that's best for him, then you need to absolve Carter and Nash too."
BlueJackets,38fhtj,judgebread,2,Fri Jun 5 12:58:04 2015 UTC,"Again, you hate Carter for taking advantage of his situation. He didn't have to play for a team he didn't want to stay on. He assessed the roster and deemed that it was garbage.   If you consider sequestering yourself away until team management has to squirrel you out and then offer nothing to the team but act like a selfish, spoiled brat, then I really don't think you have a grasp on the situation.  What Carter did was a slap in the face to CBJ fans and the team itself. Was it a good team at the time? No, but Carter is a allegedly a professional and everything he did in his short time here was the antithesis of the term.  In regards to Reilly, fine if he doesn't want to be here. At least, he's not stewing like some major league brat like Carter."
BlueJackets,38fhtj,gonzarro,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:42:03 2015 UTC,This is a terrible article. Internal cap hit? What does that even mean? Recently this same thing happened to Chicago do we think that had anything to do with the organization? This kid obviously wants to go wherever he wants. Fine so be it don't let the door hit you on the way out. I think most people's issue is with the CBA allowing this to happen. We should either be compensated or be able to hold his rights as long as we want.
BlueJackets,38fhtj,EshinX,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:43:41 2015 UTC,"Internal cap hit = How much the owners/board of governors have set for the GM to spend. It is real money, after all."
BlueJackets,38djuf,SomeKindOfMonster,16,Wed Jun 3 14:52:58 2015 UTC,"When he signs with us, everyone saying fuck Mike Reilly is gonna change tune quick. Fuck the NHL for its structure."
BlueJackets,38djuf,TheZiggurat614,15,Wed Jun 3 15:42:45 2015 UTC,I'd gladly eat a helping of humble pie if that happens.
BlueJackets,38djuf,HORSEtheGAME,4,Wed Jun 3 15:45:02 2015 UTC,"Oh I'll eat my words if he signs with us in the end. But until then, fuck him."
BlueJackets,38djuf,TheDoubleL27,2,Wed Jun 3 20:48:07 2015 UTC,I'm still not that upset with him tbh
BlueJackets,38djuf,NLP19,2,Wed Jun 3 18:44:14 2015 UTC,"I'm holding my thoughts until he signs with a team. If it's with CBJ I will be cheering him on and following his progression as a pro. If he ends up anywhere else, I will be rooting against him and whatever team he ends up on will be on my most disliked teams list (unless they are there already in which case they will most likely climb the list)."
BlueJackets,38djuf,C_Money22,12,Thu Jun 4 01:10:55 2015 UTC,I don't begrudge the kid testing the waters at all. I think the system that allows him to do so without his final team giving us some compensation is shit but he's not doing anything wrong working within that system.
BlueJackets,38djuf,Logosmonkey,9,Wed Jun 3 16:56:52 2015 UTC,The solution to Chicago's cap and defense problems walks right out of our training camp and into the United Center.  THANKS NHL!

BlueJackets,38djuf,TheZiggurat614,6,Wed Jun 3 15:12:47 2015 UTC,"He hasn't done anything wrong. His agent would be doing a disservice if he didn't get him more offers and the current system promotes this stuff. I wish he would have just signed with us but that wasn't realistic and everyone knew it. Still holding out hope that he's still got us in mind, it's not like he has ever said anything negative towards us."
BlueJackets,38djuf,triforce28,-5,Wed Jun 3 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"He doesn't want to be here, we don't want him. I bet you also felt sorry for Jeff Carter.

BlueJackets,38djuf,TheZiggurat614,-1,Wed Jun 3 16:09:16 2015 UTC,Fuck you. Just fuck you for saying that. Comparing this to the Carter situation is ignorant and you're too stupid to know it. You realize he never played for us or made a penny from us right? Go fuck your self.

BlueJackets,38djuf,Polaris10,-1,Thu Jun 4 13:54:02 2015 UTC,"Getting real tired of people here moaning about this. He has played zero games for us, and as far as I'm concerned he can test the market and go where he pleases. Not many prospects at his age with his skillset get that opportunity. God forbid he want to try and take advantage of that.   Prospects are a great passion of mine and I always want to drink heavily when I see fans turn on a young kid who has the rare chance to truly choose his destiny. Yeah! Fuck him for wanting to see if he can play closer to home in Minnesota! Or screw him for seeing what other teams might offer him in terms of money, ice time, and whatever else it is he wants out of his career at this point. It's not like he was Jeff Carter and sat in the locker room moping about for five months bringing the atmosphere down.   I love the Blue Jackets and I would love for him to be a part of what we're building here, but I am not going to fault a 21 year old for wanting to decide his own destiny. Columbus has had four years to offer him a deal, and he has had four years to think about his future."
BlueJackets,38djuf,GeekYogurt,12,Wed Jun 3 16:33:38 2015 UTC,"But that's not how it is supposed to work.  You pay your dues to the team that drafted you because that is how nearly every single professional sport maintains competitive balance.   You don't think every 21 year old would like to play for their favorite team or in their favorite city? Tough cookies. The league > you and the only reason ""you"" exist as a someone who can make a living playing a game is because of a league that has these rules."

BlueJackets,3842uq,topcopontheforce,6,Mon Jun 1 18:34:57 2015 UTC,Kukan seems like a two-way D that leans towards the defensive side of things. He's already got a couple of decent seasons in the SHL under his belt and he's yet to turn 22 (OP's title lists him as 22 but his birthday isn't until July).  I think these Euro UFA signings are always great. There's literally no risk involved and the potential for a big reward is always there.
BlueJackets,3842uq,WannabeFinn,6,Mon Jun 1 21:28:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have seen the CBJ Prospects twitter talk about him since, and it sounds like if he can adapt well to the smaller ice he has the potential to be a great piece going forward.   Agreed. Especially with how many KHL players are leaving as of late (though this isn't a case of that of course) having a GM with good European contacts is a blessing."
BlueJackets,3842uq,topcopontheforce,5,Mon Jun 1 21:32:25 2015 UTC,This should give us some solid depth for the organization in Lake Erie

BlueJackets,3842uq,feelingnodefeat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:04:42 2015 UTC,"Flyers fan here. I know each player is different, but lately the Flyers have been scouting around in Europe (and I guess a bit Russia). It's worked great for them. They got a LW/C Michael Raffl (Austria) who's been quite a steal. And they also got another C Pierre-Edouard Bellemare (France) that's been a really pleasant surprise. Both of these players were older, but Europe has a lot of undrafted UFAs with great potential.  Raffl plays on the top line at times, and based on advanced statistics (and I think he broke 20G this year), he's probably our best LW (weak depth, though). Bellemare plays on the 3C/4C or sometimes winger, but he's fast and a great playmaker. There was a time with injuries early in the year where Lecavalier was playing 2C minute and got hurt, and Bellemare filled in on 2C and carved a name for himself. Pretty sure that's when Lecavalier started to become an on/off healthy scratch."

BlueJackets,37yx6q,GeekYogurt,8,Sun May 31 16:12:20 2015 UTC,"Hawks in 7. Regular season play, Bolts have it. But post-season Hawks are terrifying. No matter how good or bad they played before. I mean, just look at that last series. They go from barely winning or barely losing the games to ""oh, yeah, we're just gonna win by three no big deal."" Playoff Hawks turn on god mode."

BlueJackets,37yx6q,Zherdev,2,Sun May 31 17:15:12 2015 UTC,"The only thing I could see working against them is maybe being banged up from who they've had to play thus far. That could slow them down a bit, but both teams will give each other a run for their money, that's for sure."
BlueJackets,37yx6q,XdefeatsY,4,Sun May 31 17:19:39 2015 UTC,"Hawks in 5. As much as I want Tampa to take it, the Hawks are just too good. Unless Crawford plays like he did in round one it's going to brutal for the Bolts"
BlueJackets,37yx6q,Back41DayOnly,4,Sun May 31 18:31:39 2015 UTC,Hawks in 6 would be my guess. I'd like to see the TBL win but the Hawks just seem to know how to get things done in the post-season.

BlueJackets,37yx6q,buckeye_baker,5,Mon Jun 1 15:59:58 2015 UTC,"Hawks in 6. Yeah the Bolts took out Price and Hank but they were surprisingly close to getting reverse swept by the Habs and got taken to 7 by both the Red Wings and the Rangers. None of those teams are really known for their scoring (Rick Nash couldn't do everything for the Rangers). On the other side of the bracket the Hawks dispatched Rinne and the great Preds defense, the final Vezina finalist Dubnyk and the great Wild defense and the Ducks who have four scary lines. The Bolts may have the best top 2 lines in the playoffs but the Hawks managed to contain Getzlaf and Kesler. The Hawks offense will be (in my opinion) the first offense that will truly test Bishop (who has been almost bipolar in his play) and the Lightning defense. I think the Hawks will win in 6 and finally win the Cup on home ice, but if Tampa wins then they take the series to 7."

JFalk's a big guy and big defensemen do better in the AHL due to players with less skill not being able to get around them. He could see some big minutes there (though hopefully not at the cost of youger players like Heatherington) and make a difference. If he can help the Monsters do well, maybe in the Calder Cup Playoffs, and maybe lay out some bonecrushing hits, he could help fill the seats which will lead to more hockey fans in Ohio which will lead to more CBJ fans which will lead to more $$$ for FAs and quality staff.

BlueJackets,37mpjt,topcopontheforce,4,Thu May 28 20:04:41 2015 UTC,"Nice, and cheap too. Probably staying bottom-pairing, unless something really changes, but worth keeping around."

BlueJackets,37hdfn,THECapedCaper,8,Wed May 27 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"God that's exciting, but I am not going to hold my breath for it."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,kevler9oh,5,Wed May 27 18:14:04 2015 UTC,I'd love to see Rychel play for this team but that would definitely make it worth it...
BlueJackets,37hdfn,HORSEtheGAME,2,Wed May 27 18:53:07 2015 UTC,"A talking point during the all-star festivities was how we were showcasing Columbus for future players. Buff, of course was here."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,GeekYogurt,11,Thu May 28 14:16:17 2015 UTC,"This how I feel about Jarmo:  -when it's comes to the basic small trade. He can turn low risk into high reward.  -When Jarmo is sitting at the draft table, I have no doubt in my mind he will hit a homer in with every single pick, because that's his bread and butter.  -The only thing that scares me a little is when he makes those big blockbuster trades. It can get a little dicey."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,CamRam26,1 point,Wed May 27 19:34:25 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought he did a great job getting Gaborik for spare parts. Gaborik didn't really work out here but it was still a good trade imo.  Jarmo did kinda get fleeced when Gaborik left town, I guess, but Gaborik's play didn't do his value any favors."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,Lewandirty,8,Wed May 27 23:00:59 2015 UTC,Matt frattin and a 5th round pick for the playoff top scorer. Maybe his extra offense would have been what we needed against the Pens...probably my least favorite action of jarmo
BlueJackets,37hdfn,TheDoubleL27,7,Thu May 28 00:29:14 2015 UTC,"And, to expand upon your point, Brassard is definitely not a ""spare part"" and is killing it in the playoffs with the Rangers"
BlueJackets,37hdfn,AKlep,7,Thu May 28 01:41:08 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is 20/20 with Brass. He was a mediocre center at best when we traded him. From 2009 until he was traded in 2013, he never had a positive +/-. He never scored more than 47 points. In fact, in 2012-2013, he was having a career-worst season. And this was all with one of the game's top LW on his line. To add to all of this, he wasn't much better last year. This year has been Brass' breakout season. So, yes, at the time, he was a spare part that was easily replaced by Dubs."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,HardKnockRiffe,4,Thu May 28 02:08:56 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but a player's potential has to be included in their value. Dude was a 6th overall pick. There's plenty of late bloomers."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,AKlep,6,Thu May 28 02:42:57 2015 UTC,"True, but you also have to account for the fact that he was in the final year of his contract and likely wouldn't have resigned with us. Also, Dorse and Moore never really stuck in the lineup in NY, so we essentially got Gaborik for Brass and a 6th, which is a deal you make every single time."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,HardKnockRiffe,1 point,Thu May 28 02:48:28 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. I guess if you factor in his contract situation, that does make it look a lot better. Plus he bashed Columbus on his way out. Douche."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,AKlep,1 point,Thu May 28 12:07:42 2015 UTC,"You have to consider their potential, but you don't have to include it in the value. To much potential goes unrealized. Who was that hot prospect that e had who decided to give up hockey before playing in the pros? Was it Legien? Sometimes picks don't pan out. Just because someone is picked 6th overall doesn't mean that he's going to be a star. Look at Filatov.  You draft a guy. You sign him. You get a few years to get a feel for his potential upside and the likelihood that they will realize that potential. If it looks bad and the contract is coming up you trade them and let someone else take the risk. Sometimes it pans out for the other team. More often than not it does not.  Also...where would Brass fit in our lineup today? We have 4 great centers already in Joey, Dubie, Artie, and Boone. Then there's Letestu and Wennberg. There's probably at least one more prospect looking to challenge for a spot that I'm forgetting about as well."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,notwhoithink,1 point,Thu May 28 03:46:36 2015 UTC,"Karlsson is the other C prospect you're forgetting. I see what you're saying, and you're definitely right that Brassard wouldn't fit in with our current group of C. He would be our 4th line C at best. Plus what /u/HardKnockRiffe mentioned about Brassard's contract makes that trade make a lot more sense too. Moore and Dorsett were expendable pieces, so yeah I guess we really didn't give up that much."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,AKlep,3,Thu May 28 12:14:16 2015 UTC,He's still never cracked 20 goals and just barely broke 60 points this season for the first time. He's a middling second line center and we had an excess at that postion.
BlueJackets,37hdfn,Lewandirty,3,Thu May 28 03:26:56 2015 UTC,"That's true. We already have a logjam there now. If he was in the mix now, he'd probably be getting traded anyways."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,AKlep,3,Thu May 28 12:08:24 2015 UTC,And a 5th?! We got a 2nd (34th in 2015) and a 3rd out of that deal not a 5th
BlueJackets,37hdfn,WannabeFinn,2,Thu May 28 04:25:29 2015 UTC,"Matt Frattin and a 5th (EDIT: 2nd and 3rd) for a Gaborik that couldn't stay healthy, seemed to have dropped off in production and came with a 7.5 million dollar cap hit.  It's still not a great trade but the market was definately down on Gaborik."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,Lewandirty,3,Thu May 28 03:29:44 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Jarmo should give Shero a call.   One Larsson, please!"
BlueJackets,37hdfn,kowdijj,5,Wed May 27 18:04:05 2015 UTC,"Devils fan here, there's no way we trade Larsson. Although the Jackets are my side girl, we're too invested in him at this point. Plus, Shero just came forward a little bit ago and said we need to build around him. Gelinas or Merrill are the more realistic options if our teams were to trade."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,MatthewWickerbasket,3,Thu May 28 06:16:22 2015 UTC,"Also a Devils fan, as yall already know.  The other dude is right.  Larsson is probably not gonna happen.  Merrill is way more likely. Id be ok with that."
BlueJackets,37hdfn,HermanBonJovi,1 point,Thu May 28 13:02:19 2015 UTC,I think either him or Gelinas would be so great for our blueline. Only thing is that they are both RFA this year so we would be trading for their rights to sign em.

Simply put: We felt like we could accomplish more in the long run by not limiting ourselves simply to ""The Union Blue.""  We want to be a part of everything as the hockey market here in Ohio continues to grow, and we want people to recognize our name as a place to go find Ohio hockey coverage, whether it's NHL coverage of the Blue Jackets, AHL coverage of the Monsters, college coverage of the Buckeyes or Redhawks or whatever else we might expand to in the future.  And of course, we hope to gain a significant following that will keep up with our growing draft coverage and any other pieces that we might write about various NHL teams.  So, (self promotion incoming), be sure to check us out if you haven't before. The people that are coming over from tUB are great and will continue to do the same great work that they were doing before the merger and the people formerly from BS Hockey will continue to grow our coverage and together I think we can grow to be an even better/larger presence in the CBJ community.   And as always if you have any specific feedback we're all ears."

BlueJackets,36wvym,nunoveaux,9,Fri May 22 21:40:04 2015 UTC,What are everyone's opinions on Rychel being moved? We have a surplus of great young forwards but I don't want to see Rychel get moved.   What is a realistic expectation of return? Would we package him with another player for a bona-fide top pairing D-man?
BlueJackets,36wvym,buckeye_baker,9,Fri May 22 20:02:30 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the same. I know we have bigger needs at defense, but I really think he's gonna be a star player :\"
BlueJackets,36wvym,GeekYogurt,7,Fri May 22 20:32:38 2015 UTC,I hope his suitors agree.

BlueJackets,36wvym,kowdijj,1 point,Tue May 26 04:12:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of the idea of moving Rychel. I think he has that ""blue collar"" game that management supposedly covets.  The list of forward prospects we do have in our system lack one thing that Rychel has: size.  I see the argument for trading a forward prospect, but I think we should trade one of our smaller skilled prospects before Rychel. For example, Sonny Milano.  EDIT TO INCLUDE:  Furthermore, I like Rychel's ""pedigree."" It's much easier for someone like him to visualize winning the cup and then make moves toward seeing that vision realized. It's because he grew up around winning teams. It's a matter of when and where not if to someone with that background."
BlueJackets,36wvym,WannabeFinn,2,Mon May 25 03:47:07 2015 UTC,"The list of forward prospects we do have in our system lack one thing that Rychel has: size.

BlueJackets,36wvym,logicoLe,5,Sat May 23 20:08:58 2015 UTC,I totally agree. If we can get povorov at 8th I'll be super happy
BlueJackets,36wvym,THECapedCaper,0,Sun May 24 04:59:35 2015 UTC,"Just sayin'... What if OEL could be gotten? What would that look like?   Rychel, Arty, our first, and maybe one of our younger defensemen (Goloubef or Connauton) for OEL and their second round pick (32nd)? Maybe that's a hefty package. But they get the opportunity for two top ten picks and we shore up a proven top pairing defenseman and the 32nd pick in a deep draft."
BlueJackets,36wvym,liar_rabbit,1 point,Sun May 24 16:58:16 2015 UTC,"That's an awful lot, I feel like we'd need more or just not give up the young defenseman."

Kidding, he gets moved, hopefully for a top 4 guy without us having to add anything/much. I think he is going to be a good player. Too bad really."
BlueJackets,36wvym,Lyun,2,Fri May 22 20:55:48 2015 UTC,"I'm still not convinced our blueline is in such disarray.   Anyone think JK could move us up in the draft with a Rychel trade? The reason I ask is because I'm kind of high on the Provorov/Pilon pairing for us. I feel like drafting a defensive pairing with that sort of established chemistry could go a long way for the Jackets. They compliment each other so damn well. So, maybe we still get Provorov with our no. 8 pick, but rumors circulating point to Philly being interested in Rychel and maybe we swap picks and shore up Ivan as a result.   I'm really just thinking out loud, but I like these lines moving into next season:  Murray - Savard  Johnson - Tyutin  Pilon - Provorov   That's a young defensive core and maybe I'm putting too much stock in future talent and Ryan Murray. I dunno. Just feeling things out."
BlueJackets,36wvym,kowdijj,8,Fri May 22 21:57:28 2015 UTC,2 rookie defense men in the NHL playing together on the same line is recipe for disaster imo. They need to play with an older player for a little while to get their legs under them and gain some experience without having the potential to fuck up at every turn.
BlueJackets,36wvym,Lyun,7,Fri May 22 22:13:12 2015 UTC,I figure Connauton is solid enough to fill in this hypothetical spot given to Pilon. Have to say that I liked what I saw from him this season.
BlueJackets,36wvym,kowdijj,2,Sat May 23 07:56:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree. We need to continue to develop Connauton, not assign him to babysitting duty. I don't think we should expect our pick to be in our line up next season (unless we move up, significantly)."
BlueJackets,36wvym,Lyun,1 point,Mon May 25 03:41:33 2015 UTC,"I know, but which of our other defenseman are weaker than Connauton to the point that they should be relegated to third-pairing duties? I understand that Provorov isn't likely to join the NHL in his first year, but if he hypothetically did, I can't really see anybody else on our roster that could be dropped back to join him.  Maybe switch Tyuts and Connauton, but I'm not sure of which hand they shoot with. If they're not the same handedness, that's an issue."
BlueJackets,36wvym,WannabeFinn,1 point,Mon May 25 03:48:23 2015 UTC,"Good point. I think Tyutin is on the decline, but if Connauton doesn't take a step forward this year, he probably will find himself playing with a younger defenseman anyways."
BlueJackets,36wvym,logicoLe,1 point,Mon May 25 04:13:38 2015 UTC,"Supposedly, Tyuts and Connauton are both left-handed shooters anyways, so either on a line with Provorov would mean two left shooters.  On the other hand, Pilon is also a left shooter, so the initial suggestion still would have had two left shooters."
BlueJackets,36wvym,WannabeFinn,6,Mon May 25 04:22:48 2015 UTC,Pilon? No way does he make an NHL roster this fall
BlueJackets,36wvym,SovietShooter,1 point,Fri May 22 23:08:01 2015 UTC,I know I'm being naive. How do you feel about Provorov? You'd rather see more veteran presence on the blueline?
BlueJackets,36wvym,XdefeatsY,1 point,Fri May 22 23:58:41 2015 UTC,"I think Provorov could crack a roster. But yeah, some more vet presence."
BlueJackets,36wvym,Swabeky,4,Sat May 23 00:03:15 2015 UTC,"I'm still not convinced our blueline is in such disarray.    It isn't about it  being a bad D, it is about upgrading to a playoff caliber D.   Rychel could end up being real good, but immediately he would be a 3-4th line FWD. If Jarmo can flip a 3rd line FWD for a first line D, he should do it. Ideally you would want a D that is in similar position - young prospect with mucho upside stuck behind solid vets. But if you can get a proven D and prospects, that helps too."

It's been an okay first year teaching, but I'm just ready for this group of kids to move on. I'm sitting here watching students, many of whom need to pass the final exam to pass the class, just sit around and idly tap a pencil or poorly conceal their texting instead of working on the review assignment.

BlueJackets,36vp69,GeekYogurt,2,Fri May 22 16:27:00 2015 UTC,I hope he can get his game back--working with good goalie coach for that team could be a big blessing--as he has been a pretty big disappointment for a 2nd round pick thus far. Hope Korpisalo works out better in Lake Erie than he did.
BlueJackets,36vp69,topcopontheforce,2,Fri May 22 19:42:42 2015 UTC,Hopefully he can gain more confidence and improve his game by being a starting goalie in the SEL next season and get enough 1-on-1 time with his goaltending coach over there. I haven't seen Korpisalo in action and Forsberg was kind of a let down when he filled in a few times last season; despite rocking it in Springfield.   Jarmo said it would be Forsberg and Korpisalo in Cleveland next season so I am curious to find out if they will re-sign McElhinney or pursue someone else via free agency.

BlueJackets,36jfnx,Roughly6Owls,6,Tue May 19 20:57:07 2015 UTC,Poor Dubi I really think he earned this the last two years but I guess Foligno was the best second choice so whatever
BlueJackets,36jfnx,scote614,10,Wed May 20 03:28:00 2015 UTC,"I love Dubinsky, but he's far too hot-headed and unpredictable to be captain. He loses his shit all the time, and that passion is admirable, but it can cause leadership issues."
BlueJackets,36jfnx,cbjfan51,-1,Wed May 20 05:04:38 2015 UTC,I guess but every single game Dubi is the first one on the ice to fist bump the team as they enter the ice to warm up. He's the only guy to wait by the bench after every single win to congratulate his team. And I am 99% sure he is the most vocal person in that locker room. I love Foligno but this was a shitty publicity stunt by Jarmo and John D To try and get more fans involved. Wouldn't surprise me if they give an A to that lazy POS RyJo.
BlueJackets,36jfnx,scote614,1 point,Wed May 20 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"Everything you said about Dubi is correct except for the most vocal in the locker room. It's been echoed several times that Foligno is. And most vocal doesn't always translate to best leader, either. This was not a publicity stunt at all. The players have a huge say in who the captain is, and they wanted Foligno. The A won't go to RyJo. Calm down."

BlueJackets,36jfnx,Formerleafsfan,2,Wed May 20 09:10:33 2015 UTC,Yep. And unfortunately porty makes it sound like CBJ doesn't plan on trying too hard to bring him back since they have a long list of good young prospects

That agent is a total jackass, and I have always felt that he is a prime reason Kerby didn't get much of a look out of camp. He probably would have taken a Rychel call up (in place of Dano) as a reason to ask for crazy comparables  or whatever madness goes on in his head come contract time.  Remember the agent said Joey and Johnny Toews are the same. I love Joey, but... he is not Toews.   I thought Kerby looked better than Wennberg and Dano early on."

BlueJackets,36fq0i,xanbo,3,Tue May 19 02:39:32 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who still likes the old throwback Jackets Jerseys? And also, the white jerseys as the home jerseys?"
BlueJackets,36fq0i,CamRam26,2,Tue May 19 06:25:24 2015 UTC,"White jerseys were originally the home jersey for the NHL.  The NHL wanted fans to be able to see more color so instead of seeing every teams whites you got to see their full color jersey when they came to visit.  The full color jerseys were more popular when traveling because they hid things like blood better than the white and travelling way back in the day meant you didn't have the same facilities that you had at your home venue (read laundry services, players would sometimes play in dirty jerseys).  Today they'll switch it up, in recent years the Jackets have worn their home blue's in Detroit and even their third away in Pittsburgh."
BlueJackets,36fq0i,Dr_James_Rustler,1 point,Tue May 19 11:37:31 2015 UTC,"According to Uni Watch, teams used to have 1 jersey (color), and the Red Wings started a tradition of wearing white on the road/colors at home.

BlueJackets,36gc4e,grinny588,2,Wed May 20 18:02:06 2015 UTC,Dude you do a GREAT job. You have to consider that Black Keys song though... It's tailor-made for this.
BlueJackets,36gc4e,GeekYogurt,3,Thu May 21 00:23:41 2015 UTC,Thanks! That's actually not a bad idear. Have considered playing it after a win as well

BlueJackets,36gc4e,Big_Green_Piccolo,9,Thu May 28 22:35:17 2015 UTC,I would keep it exactly how it is. Out goal horn and music kicks ass! Blackhawks have a sick tradition with their goal horn. We'll never build a tradition like that if we change the goal horn and music for each new era.
BlueJackets,36gc4e,AKlep,3,Tue May 19 04:22:27 2015 UTC,"But the Hawks haven't always had Chelsea Dagger, it was pretty much brought in with our new era and Kane and Toews. I don't think tweaking the goal celebration is bad thing."

Maybe something like ""Click Click Boom"" by Saliva and get a loop of the chorus.   *edit: Hell, maybe even go with Iron Maiden for the whole Soldier vibe, like The Trooper"
BlueJackets,36gc4e,hryhoriyy,3,Tue May 19 13:58:59 2015 UTC,"Aw hell yea, ""The Trooper"" would rule!"
BlueJackets,36gc4e,Tropist,4,Tue May 19 18:54:32 2015 UTC,"As a newer fan, I've always liked our ""crowd chant"" kind of goal music. It feels like it brings the whole arena together after every goal. That being said, I completely understand it can feel a little cheesy and wouldn't be entirely opposed to change if the right music can be found, especially one perhaps preferred by Foligno and the boys."
BlueJackets,36gc4e,phaqueNaiyem,2,Tue May 19 15:04:40 2015 UTC,"I hate the sing-along song.  It feels so much like something some corporate manager would think is a good idea.  Much better when things like that begin organically and aren't blared over the speakers.  Other than that, meh."

BlueJackets,36gc4e,humpcatting,2,Tue May 19 15:36:37 2015 UTC,Actually is a dope ass album.
BlueJackets,36gc4e,Aperture-Employee,2,Wed May 20 02:13:17 2015 UTC,"I politely disagree, the horn is great and then there's a pause, AC/DC yells, another pause and then the cannon goes off and then the celebration begins. I'm fine with finding another song in place of The Whip but I dislike the AC/DC much more."
BlueJackets,36gc4e,mrtuggles,1 point,Tue May 19 15:35:55 2015 UTC,But the AC/DC intro is at least relevant to the Blue Jacket's theme (We salute you). I think the goofy sing-a-long after kind of takes that away.  It's a bizarre contrast.  We need more of a war-timey fight song. Just put the trumpet guy from outside in there and have him play the ants go marching one by one and we can all yell HURRAH! HURRAH!  Edit: This song.
BlueJackets,36gc4e,Aperture-Employee,2,Tue May 19 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sold on the whole ""we need a war-timey fight song"". Singing along after a goal is fun, having an old war song played and yelling hurrah in unison is much too strict. There's a reason Chelsea Dagger has thrived in the UC, it's a simple chromatic melody that everyone can sing and is fun to sing, the operative word being fun. Sticking too much to a military theme takes away a lot of fun to be had unless you can find a gimmick (like the cannon) to make it lighthearted."
BlueJackets,36gc4e,mrtuggles,1 point,Tue May 19 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"For me, polishing off a few 22 ouncers and yelling war chants after a goal sounds like a hell of a good time.  Moreso than singing ""whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh"".  God it's the worst."
BlueJackets,36gc4e,Back41DayOnly,1 point,Tue May 19 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"I like The AC/DC bit and the cannon will never leave us because it fucking rocks. The Whip is by far the weakest part. I'd remove that and cut in a live version of a rocking song where people are already chanting/singing along. Something like this: https://youtu.be/NAq0rL8E4hM [starting at 1:06 because apparently I don't know how to link specific times in a youtube video.]  ""For those about to rock, FIRE!""  [Cannon]  ""We Salute you..."" [tsh, tsh, tsh] ""Yeah!""  You get the idea. Hard to exactly describe it directly through text. Could even just loop the song from 1:10-1:20 after that little intro section, without actually going into the song/lyrics. I think it'd be a major upgrade while still giving the crowd something to cheer/chant along with if they so choose."

BlueJackets,369ruu,IAmAChemicalEngineer,10,Sun May 17 18:55:32 2015 UTC,But we're now under Clarkson's terrible contract.
BlueJackets,369ruu,Big_Green_Piccolo,6,Sun May 17 20:16:01 2015 UTC,We'll see. He may rebound outside of Toronto.
BlueJackets,369ruu,GeekYogurt,4,Mon May 18 02:30:01 2015 UTC,I'd be ecstatic to get 15 goals and a solid bottom 6 role out of him but that's still not worth his cap hit. Not by a lot.
BlueJackets,369ruu,WannabeFinn,7,Mon May 18 06:01:30 2015 UTC,But it would still be more production than e would have gotten from Horton.
BlueJackets,369ruu,notwhoithink,3,Mon May 18 11:04:22 2015 UTC,"This is the best way to look at it.  If he puts up those numbers it's not worth the cap hit for sure. But consider that Horton would have cost $5.3M on average through 2020 and is most likely never going to put up anything.  Clarkson will be $5.25M for the same length of time.  And he COULD be better in C-Bus than he was with the Leafs, stranger things have happened.  Recap: Clarkson cost $50K less and is guaranteed to have more production than Horton."
BlueJackets,369ruu,Derp_a_Derp,2,Mon May 18 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"That equation is a couple steps too simple:  Horton's ""cost"" also has to include at least an NHL minimum salary to cover his roster spot. So, that's another $500k per year, minimum that Horton would cost us.  On the other hand, Clarkson's production needs to be measured against Horton's replacement at this point, not Horton. So, his numbers are not competing with 0, they are competing with at least a league minimum type player."
BlueJackets,369ruu,GeekYogurt,2,Mon May 18 23:22:28 2015 UTC,"Horton is more expensive and Clarkson will be competing against a league minimum player.  Understood, thanks.  So now I have Clarkson at $550k less AND if he puts up numbers better than a league minimum player he will seem like a deal!  Step 1: Trade for Clarkson Step 2: Trade Boll Step 3: ??? Step 4: Columbus Blue Jackets are your Stanley Cup Champions!!!"

BlueJackets,369ruu,laxpulse,8,Mon May 18 03:55:54 2015 UTC,Commodore never deserved a buyout.  If Arniel wasn't so much of a douche Commie would have probably been serviceable to the end of his contract. I hate thinking about that era.  Dark Days.
BlueJackets,369ruu,nine_eyed_spider,4,Sun May 17 20:50:40 2015 UTC,"If Arniel wasn't so much of a douche Commie would have probably been serviceable to the end of his contract,   Part of me agrees with this.  The other part remembers that after the CBJ cut him loose that he played a total of 30 NHL games split between Detroit and Tampa bay, then spent the next season in the AHL and the one after that in the KHL before retiring.  I really don't like Arniel.  I also know that Commodore's partying ways were negatively influencing some of the younger players, to the point where they ended up trading those players away.  For as much as Arniel poisoned the relationship with the players on the team, I think that he might have actually had this one right."
BlueJackets,369ruu,notwhoithink,8,Mon May 18 02:05:59 2015 UTC,"The best thing about Commodore is that I met him at a bar after a game and he was piss drunk despite having an afternoon game the next day.

BlueJackets,36737b,nunoveaux,5,Tue May 19 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"Guess that late season surge was enough to convince Jarmo to get those final pieces for a playoff run. It would suck to lose him at this point in his career, but Dano and Wennburg have certainly ""bloomed"" faster than Rychel, and we will need a solid 6th Dman if want to go the distance next year.  Doesn't hurt to test the trade waters now that Reilly is (more than likely) not signing with us."
BlueJackets,36737b,saintcarbine,1 point,Sun May 17 00:12:52 2015 UTC,"It comes down to the fact we have a stupid amount of promising forwards and really no promising defensemen in the organization. I've come to terms with the fact that we'll have to trade a forward or two that has potential in order to get a defenseman with potential.   We could draft a defenseman and keep our forwards, but I think Jarmo sees that we could really make a run if our defense is improved, and he sees that trading Rychel won't hurt us that much at the forward position, especially since he didn't play much with the big club at all this year."
BlueJackets,36737b,andrewdt10,2,Sun May 17 14:22:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This could totally come back to bite us in the long run, but if it means a cup run this year or next, I'm happy with it."
BlueJackets,36737b,saintcarbine,1 point,Sun May 17 14:53:22 2015 UTC,"I think trading one or two forwards for an NHL ready defenseman wouldn't hurt that much in the long run because of the amount of forwards we have in the organization. I think we'll be fine, but we'll also have a chance to make a run with a team that doesn't have any ""rental"" players, which is what you want to see."
BlueJackets,36737b,andrewdt10,2,Sun May 17 14:56:53 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even be upset if they do bring in a rental or two to make a serious push for the conference finals or the cup finals. Guess it would depend on how the regulars perform down the stretch. If they pull another Wiz at the deadline I'll be livid.
BlueJackets,36737b,saintcarbine,1 point,Sun May 17 17:33:20 2015 UTC,I just don't think they're close enough for a rental or two to be the difference maker. I just think they need to be in the mindset where a good investment in a defenseman would be better off for the time being.
BlueJackets,36737b,andrewdt10,2,Sun May 17 17:59:08 2015 UTC,Definitely makes sense to have that mindframe with the way the team is built right now. I think a package deal with Rychel and Anisimov could net a very nice top 4 dman.
BlueJackets,36737b,saintcarbine,1 point,Sun May 17 18:58:45 2015 UTC,"Also worth pointing out we invested a LOT of money in this roster -- Foligno, Bobrovsky, Dubinsky, and Johansen all getting big pay raises in the last 12 months.  Paying all those guys means that we are a team that needs to be making moves to make sure that the money spent on the players we've identified as core pieces isn't wasted on ""rebuilding"" years."

BlueJackets,36737b,NLP19,3,Sat May 16 23:06:50 2015 UTC,Seems like Devils would be an ideal trade partner right?
BlueJackets,36737b,thatkidyouknow2,6,Sat May 16 23:45:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, we've got a glutton of NHL-ready defensemen.   Some possible trade bait include Graborenko, Helgeson, Merrill, Gelinas, Scarlett, and a good number of others. Shero should really be all over this, especially with Rychel's and Shero's connections with USA Hockey."
BlueJackets,36737b,thethinglonger,3,Sun May 17 01:16:00 2015 UTC,Rychel's connections with USA hockey? He's Canadian
BlueJackets,36737b,andrewdt10,3,Sun May 17 01:34:19 2015 UTC,"I can't find the interview/report, but I know the CBJ were interested in Gelinas, to some degree."
BlueJackets,36737b,Lahtelainen,2,Sun May 17 14:20:32 2015 UTC,"Devils are in the same division, so not ideal in that sense.  My wild guess for a trade partner would be Dallas. They have a nice stack of NHL-ready young d-men. And if Connauton is an example of the quality level then go for it..."
BlueJackets,36737b,nunoveaux,1 point,Mon May 18 21:10:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly -- It's easy to forget we're trading with a divisional rival... and there are a lot of other teams out west who need D at the expense of extra forwards.  Off the top, NJ is probably going to listen to Edmonton for Leon Draisaitl first.  Then, i'd think San Jose would want to talk about any one of those Defenseman."
BlueJackets,36737b,SomeKindOfMonster,8,Tue May 19 19:54:04 2015 UTC,Why did we move Wiz again?
BlueJackets,36737b,AKlep,10,Sat May 16 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"5.5m cap hit + aging + defensive liability? I imagine the top 4 D we look to acquire plays a more sound defensive game with an average offensive game (a la prime Tyutin). JJ, Savard, Murray, Connauton, etc. all provide enough offense for us on the back end. IMO it'll be a big upgrade to essentially ""swap"" Wisniewski for a more shutdown-oriented Dman."
BlueJackets,36737b,AKlep,2,Sat May 16 20:46:14 2015 UTC,"I'd like to keep Rychel if possible. I'd rather get rid of lower upside guys like Anderson, Morin, and Wild Bill. Obviously that reduces the return, but I'd rather see Rychel at the NHL level for an extended period of time before making a decision on him."
BlueJackets,36737b,nunoveaux,4,Sun May 17 01:58:05 2015 UTC,"Anderson and Morin would return someone like Prout. We don't need that. Karlsson might return someone like Connauton. Again, another type of player we don't need. We gotta give to get and right now we've got the assets to fork over enough for a top flight defender."
BlueJackets,36737b,Nucklehead162,1 point,Sun May 17 03:41:09 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I just love our assets though.

It seems like most players sign with the organization that drafted them, but what is stopping everyone from doing this (assuming they had the talent to be picky) and the team that drafted them getting screwed. I mean it sounds like we'd get some picks or something back for his rights, but what if the cycle just repeats again and we just get more draft future picks instead of guys in positions we need?

BlueJackets,3669z9,CamRam26,1 point,Sat May 16 16:52:54 2015 UTC,I assume that the player loses out on significant pay - both in terms of the minor-league pay itself and getting to an intermediate-level contract more quickly.

BlueJackets,35wmso,NLP19,3,Thu May 14 13:06:41 2015 UTC,At least now we get to watch Tampa get revenge on St. Louis.
BlueJackets,35wmso,HORSEtheGAME,2,Thu May 14 15:15:08 2015 UTC,Caps Game 7s are the worst I'm convinced. At least 1OT is guaranteed. My heart can't take it.

BlueJackets,35w8id,Bubbz1211,6,Thu May 14 01:00:16 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend hockeystreams.com. HD streams, several server locations, multiple feeds, and all of the minor leagues and more. Been using it for the past couple seasons and rarely have any issues and when/if I do, they are very helpful via email. It streams on Chromecast and Roku. All kinds of pricing plans at the bottom of that link, $110 for a year and so on. Hope this helps!"
BlueJackets,35w8id,SomeKindOfMonster,1 point,Thu May 14 01:13:08 2015 UTC,Fun fact: you can actually stream this site off of your PS4 if you use the mobile site.
BlueJackets,35w8id,HORSEtheGAME,2,Fri May 15 01:19:55 2015 UTC,What methods are you using to watch gamecenter? I'm curious because it's been super smooth for me via an AppleTV for going on 3 years now.
BlueJackets,35w8id,CBJFan,1 point,Fri May 15 02:12:14 2015 UTC,"I used a Ps3. It's way better on my roku and now ps4 but I still get annoyed if I get blacked out or something. I moved from Chicago to Fort Wayne, so in Chicago I'd never get blacked out but after moving to Fort Wayne towards the end of the season the last couple games were blacked out for me. I'm just not a huge fan of it."
BlueJackets,35w8id,CBJFan,1 point,Fri May 15 10:33:59 2015 UTC,"The PS3 app is sort of notorious for being horrible. I wouldn't judge gamecenter based on that.  It's flawless on the AppleTV. The app keeps getting better, too, with the addition of past season's games. Won't help you with blackouts, but something to consider."
BlueJackets,35w8id,TheDoubleL27,1 point,Sat May 16 02:12:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've read that. I think if hockey streams is the same price or less I'll go with that, if gamecenter is cheaper I'll go with them again....and suffer the blackouts :("
BlueJackets,35w8id,SomeKindOfMonster,1 point,Sat May 16 02:42:13 2015 UTC,"There's hockeystreams.com, which is a paid subscription streaming service. I used it this past season and the quality was really good, plus you had access to recordings of all the games. Their compatibility with chromecast can be buggy at times but I liked everything else about it. Pretty sure its relatively illegal, however they've been around for quite a while."
BlueJackets,35w8id,habituallysuspect,1 point,Thu May 14 01:12:33 2015 UTC,Good call on the recordings. Makes the offseason much easier.

For the majority of the season, I was using Ragecenter, which was really quite nice--until it just stopped working completely at the end of the season. Ragecenter is free, which is nice, but the Chromecast/Roku streaming of Hockeystreams is the real kicker for me."

However, at the end of the season when it stopped working you could still use the link generator and just paste it to your browser to watch the game in full HD. It just didn't work in Ragecenter anymore.   Also there's this website that Ragecenter uses the links of: http://xrxs.net/nhl/#"

There's so much to learn, even though the Blue Jackets are a young franchise. I'm still learning new things about the Jackets and hockey every day. Be patient, soak in everything you can, and don't be afraid to ask questions if you plan on sticking around in this sub for a while. I root for all Cleveland/Columbus teams, and this sub has the best community out of them by far. Everyone will support your desire to learn more and answer questions as they arise.

BlueJackets,35mgeg,foreverphoenix,6,Mon May 11 19:14:20 2015 UTC,"For starters, if you have Twitter, be sure to follow @APortzline, @RobMixer, and @Smitchcd. You'll get general news on the team from them.   As far as current players go, we have way too many. I'm going to list all of the players who are under contract, and in the team's future plans in some capacity (whether it be a trade chip or to play for the NHL club). So this will include NHL and high upside AHL players. These are the names you need to know.   Forwards: Ryan Johansen, Nick Foligno, Cam Atkinson, Boone Jenner, Scott Hartnell, David Clarkson, Jeremy Morin, Alexander Wennberg, Marko Dano (fan favorite in this sub), Brandon Dubinsky, Matt Calvert, Artem Anisimov, Kerby Rychel, Josh Anderson, Oliver Bjorkstrand, Sonny Milano, William Karlsson, Jared Boll (fan least favorite in this sub)  Defensemen: Ryan Murray, Jack Johnson, David Savard, Dalton Prout, Kevin Connauton, Fedor Tyutin, Justin Falk, Austin Madaisky, Dillon Heatherington  Goaltenders: Sergei Bobrovsky, Anton Forsberg, Oscar Dansk"
BlueJackets,35mgeg,ScarletWitch65,4,Mon May 11 21:15:40 2015 UTC,"New fan just moved here from Ontario.  Their future is bright.  Toronto's is so dark, I need shades to cheer for Columbus.  The games are great to go to.  Their anthem singer is great and beloved.  They fire a cannon whenever they score (and it's loud as F***), they're OOOOOONNNN THEEEEEE POWOERRPLAAAYY every time they draw a penalty.  It's a great crowd and a great atmosphere.  It can also be lively; it's close enough to Toronto so when I go to TOR-CBJ games, It's usually at least 20% opposing fans, and the fan base in Columbus isn't HUGE (yet), but it's growing every year, and it's the only profesisonal sports franchise in Columbus (the favourite sport being NCAAF, the OSU Buckeyes.  Try not wearing scarlet-and-grey on a saturday in the fall, you will be the outsider).  The bandwagon is filling up, jump on while you can like I did!  edit last season they ended with the best last10 record in the league.  They missed the play offs because they were #1 in injuries in the entire league, must have been some sort of record (key players too, like bob).  If they go injury low in 2015/2016, they would easily make play offs if not 1st in division."
BlueJackets,35mgeg,TidoNags,7,Tue May 12 15:20:44 2015 UTC,"Columbus has the Crew, too!   They have an even smaller recognition in CBus..."
BlueJackets,35mgeg,Greenlytrees,6,Tue May 12 16:04:37 2015 UTC,"I swear I've read/heard this a million times, but ""we're a young team with a very promising prospect pool."" Also, ""the future is bright."" Seriously, though... Jarmo and John Davidson are doing great things with the team. I'm not going to get too much into coaching/the roster, but I really enjoyed watching Marko Dano this season. Our most popular/loved players are Bob, Joey, and Foligno, whose breakout year will probably land him the captain position - which has been vacant since we traded Nash to the Rangers.  Speaking of which, fans are divided on Nash. Some hate him, some don't mind him. He did a lot of great stuff for us when he was here, but he pushed Bob and upset a lot of people. Fans are not divided on Jeff Carter or Adam Foote, though... they're both universally hated or not cared about anymore.   Unfortunately most of Ohio doesn't care about the Blue Jackets, and most of Columbus revolves around Ohio State football. So we are a small (but strong) fan base. We're pretty tight-knit, though and very friendly.  If you ever have the opportunity to attend a game, you should. The arena district is an incredible location to attend an event. Parking is affordable and traffic is not an issue. There are nearby restaurants and bars that have pretty affordable happy hour specials before weekday games. NWA itself, the atmosphere varies depending on when the game is and who we are playing. We have a cannon that gets fired off when we score (and before each game, and after a win), which is unique and pretty cool. The arena is pretty well designed and you don't need to worry about a bad/obstructed view.   Edit: Oh, and people LOVE the team's official twitter account. They're a fun/snarky bunch."

BlueJackets,35mgeg,notwhoithink,6,Mon May 11 20:50:40 2015 UTC,It's a great arena and we typically have a pretty great atmosphere in there.  Totally recommend going to a game here if you have the chance.
BlueJackets,35mgeg,AKlep,2,Mon May 11 21:22:09 2015 UTC,I hope to go to a game one day. The cannon might scare me though.

The team is an awesome group of guys we've been put in a very fortunate position the last few years to make the moves that we have and acquire the roster we have now. We are definitely a team to watch every year. Had it not been for our 500+ man games lost we would probably be right there in the playoffs this year.

BlueJackets,35mgeg,AKlep,2,Tue May 12 18:56:40 2015 UTC,That doesn't make it ok though
BlueJackets,35mgeg,notwhoithink,1 point,Wed May 13 00:01:00 2015 UTC,"It's every bit as Ok as baiting him all game is. It's a very competitive sport. Part of the game is psychological. Whether that comes in the form of taunts our in the form of being scared of getting pasted into the boards every time you touch the puck, is as much mental as physical. Had he pushed anyone but the goalie nobody would have even noticed, let alone given two shits."
BlueJackets,35mgeg,AKlep,4,Wed May 13 00:23:45 2015 UTC,I disagree. You don't touch Bob. Ever. It's that simple for me.
BlueJackets,35mgeg,TidoNags,1 point,Wed May 13 00:31:59 2015 UTC,"I forgot that Bob was made of glass. He's a big boy. Getting shoved once by Nash on a typical hockey play isn't enough to undo the years of good work that Nash put in for us, except for some exceptionally ignorant homer-types. It's not like he threw a punch. It's not like he delivered an overhead chop with his stick. He just gave him a little push after being provoked."
BlueJackets,35mgeg,RaynebowBryte,3,Wed May 13 00:40:20 2015 UTC,I still like Nash. He's one of my favorite players. You still just can't touch Bob. You just can't. I wanted Calvert to knock his ass out in that fight right after that happened.

BlueJackets,35d77r,ScarletWitch65,6,Sat May 9 17:22:41 2015 UTC,I'm just sayin it's not unreasonable at all
BlueJackets,35d77r,Aperture-Employee,2,Sat May 9 17:23:48 2015 UTC,Well now it isn't for sure.
BlueJackets,35d77r,ScarletWitch65,2,Sun May 10 03:39:30 2015 UTC,I'm right there with you. I hate them for reasons I can't explain.
BlueJackets,35d77r,humpcatting,8,Mon May 11 03:55:21 2015 UTC,"I've noticed, it's a damn shame. And feels like a waste of a trade now."
BlueJackets,35d77r,SomeKindOfMonster,7,Sat May 9 04:57:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure why he was traded to begin with. None of us are. Maybe Jarmo knows something we don't though, and there was a reason he was traded that no one knows about. Of course, I'm baselessly speculating, but you have to wonder why a seemingly top pair defenseman who drives puck possession is being scratched."
BlueJackets,35d77r,AKlep,3,Sat May 9 06:28:34 2015 UTC,IIRC he had a pretty hefty contract that made it tough to get our younger guys cycling through the system.  Only thing that allowed young guys to play was the inevitable Murray injuries.
BlueJackets,35d77r,el_karacho,3,Sat May 9 16:08:11 2015 UTC,Doesn't that just show we over valued him? He couldn't make the cut in Anaheim but here he's top 2? Sounds like we got rid of him for a reason.
BlueJackets,35d77r,TheZiggurat614,4,Mon May 11 21:28:57 2015 UTC,"I posted about this a while ago and it was removed due to being ""not relevant"" I'm sorry but I'll always love wiz, and I want to see him succeed even if it's without us."
BlueJackets,35d77r,cagedcandy,2,Sat May 9 17:53:26 2015 UTC,Looks like he's not good enough.

BlueJackets,35d77r,NLP19,2,Sat May 9 04:41:47 2015 UTC,"They've been icing Clayton Stoner, it's not so much depth as it is the fact that Boudreau is an idiot."
BlueJackets,35d77r,Buckeye931,9,Sat May 9 06:33:26 2015 UTC,"An odor idiot who is going to make it to at least the conference finals, and might win a cup.  I don't like Wiz be traded or scratched, but calling their coach an idiot for sticking with what works is a bit idiotic too.  EDIT: Silly autocorrect."
BlueJackets,35d77r,notwhoithink,6,Sat May 9 13:22:35 2015 UTC,They've only lost 1 game in 2 rounds of playoff hockey. He's gotta be doing something right.
BlueJackets,35d77r,CantGetAGirlfriend,3,Sat May 9 14:09:36 2015 UTC,"Because Anaheim hasn't flopped at all under Boudreau in the past? And he was just brilliant in Washington, especially when he managed to waste the best years of Ovechkin, Backstrom, Semin, and Greene. Yes, a fantastic coach. Bad coaches win with great rosters, see: Carlyle, Randy. Anaheim is winning because they have a loaded roster, not because Boudreau is performing some wizardry from the bench."
BlueJackets,35d77r,Buckeye931,1 point,Sun May 10 00:11:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's so much him as his team. He has an incredibly strong cast to work with, if they went anywhere but WCF they would be underperforming. He hasn't gotten past the Conference finals, iirc. Never been a fan of Boudreau."
BlueJackets,35d77r,Beartoes1,2,Sat May 9 20:00:35 2015 UTC,It also shows that we over valued wiz. A lot.
BlueJackets,35d77r,TheZiggurat614,2,Tue May 12 13:52:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. He is a really good d-man, Anaheim is just sticking with what is working. I'm sure if they lose the first couple games they'll put him in"
BlueJackets,35d77r,NLP19,3,Tue May 12 16:16:05 2015 UTC,"I think they realized pretty quick that he was overvalued. Wouldn't be surprised to see him in a deal in the off season. If our #2 Dman is a healthy scratch somewhere else, however deep they may be, it says we either overvalued him or our defense is complete garbage. I think it's overvalued personally. Not that I think he's a bad player, we just paid him way more than anyone else ever would have."
BlueJackets,35d77r,TheZiggurat614,0,Tue May 12 18:09:57 2015 UTC,"It's almost as though Nick Leddy wasn't used the right way in Chicago and now he's one of the best defenders in the entire league in NYI.  Teams mismanage their players, the Ducks are included in this."
BlueJackets,35d77r,UrinalPies,1 point,Wed May 13 17:04:15 2015 UTC,"It's almost as though you couldn't get more condescending with how you said that. But you're right, teams mismanage talent. Did you know teams overpay players too?"
BlueJackets,35d77r,TheZiggurat614,0,Fri May 15 00:15:04 2015 UTC,"To say that Wisniewski, who has put up really good numbers ever since he has been on the CBJ (numbers that actually justify his price tag) is now suddenly overvalued because a team is playing Clayton Stoner over him doesn't make any sense at all.   You can't just disregard a guy's career and simply say ""he's overvalued"" because the Ducks aren't playing him in the playoffs."
BlueJackets,35d77r,UrinalPies,3,Fri May 15 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think Wiz being overvalued is new. He's overvalued since the day we signed him, when we were forced to pay more money than other teams cause at the time we were in a bad place. I do think it is very telling that our ""number 2"" defenseman isn't even on the top 6 of another team. I don't think the Ducks wanted to bring in a expensive player, just for him to sit on his couch. He obviously did not live up to their expectations for him.  I don't think anyone is saying to disregard his career. I think it is just acknowledging that our front office saw the writing on the wall and unloaded an overpaid player to improve as a franchise going forward."
BlueJackets,35d77r,CrazyLegLaFleur1,2,Fri May 15 12:24:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not, you're misunderstanding. I think we overvalued him from day one and his points don't off set his huge turnovers at the blue line or arrant passes. Everyone loved him cause he got points, we needed him to play defense too and that wasn't his strong point at all."

BlueJackets,35bu4q,sav2880,4,Sat May 9 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúand‚Äù, ‚ÄúI'm‚Äù, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúand‚Äù, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

No one says Madison Bumgarner ""stole"" the Giants a World Series.  TL/DR: Goalies are important and we have a great one. No one stole shite. IMO."
BlueJackets,34xwmw,GeekYogurt,5,Tue May 5 17:57:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the ""Bob stole a game"" sentiment is used to imply the rest of the team did nothing. Goalie is the one position in hockey that has the most impact on the game. Like you mentioned, he is the only player on the ice who is out there for 60 minutes. When Bob is at his best, he can impact the game more (and for longer) than any other player on the team can. It's not a knock on the team performance. It's just what happens when your best player happens to play the most impactful position."

It turns out Jenner came back on 11/4 and November was not kind to the CBJ (2-9-2, but Boone was back in time for the loss on 11/1).  He was in the lineup through 12/18 (CBJ got 15/16 points in those December games) and then the Jackets won 5/7 through the rest of the month after he went on the IR.    By the time he got back into the lineup again on 3/21, the Jackets had already heated up, having won 6 of the previous 8.  Of course, they stayed hot or even got hotter getting 21/22 points in their final 11 games.

BlueJackets,34poua,thehildabeast,3,Sun May 3 16:44:13 2015 UTC,And friend of mine and I decided to get more into soccer and follow the Crew from Indianapolis. I still haven't managed to watch a match.
BlueJackets,34poua,Aperture-Employee,2,Sun May 3 17:27:11 2015 UTC,"I live 20 minutes from crew (mapfre) stadium and can't watch TWC sports in HD, only SD is available here. I'd buy MLS live, but I'm blacked out on there. Not only that, the announcers/coverage is awful anyway. It's a total shit deal that doesn't appear to be going away anytime soon."
BlueJackets,34poua,TidoNags,1 point,Sun May 3 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"This is the second year of the deal between the Crew and TWC.  Crew officials have actually stated openly the new ownership group will be ending the deal after this season.    My understanding is that the Crew were either paying for time, or getting no revenue from previous deals with FSO, and the previous ownership took the deal with TWC because they paid something for the rights. Only after the fact did fans learn about the blackout restrictions, and by that time Precourt had already purchased the team.   The awful awful TV deal is obviously hurting Crew attendance, as it is virtually impossible to see Crew games in Columbus. Obviously TWC was doing this in an attempt to force Crew fans with satellite to become TWC customers, but my understanding is that many parts of Columbus do not even have access to TWC, as Comcast is the local provider, and they do not carry TWSports. FWIW, this appears to be the same issue Lakers & Dodgers fans have w/ TWC out in LA.   The only saving grace of the Crew deal w/ TWC is that the Crew is their top priority, and it is never bumped or relegated to an alternate channel. When they were on FSO, they would often get bumped for Reds/Indians/Jackets/Cavs."
BlueJackets,34poua,SovietShooter,1 point,Sun May 3 20:12:02 2015 UTC,"I had read something that it was here to stay at the start of the season, but that was probably (hopefully) in reference to this season, as it was a 2 year deal. I'll take your word for it.   Oddly enough, I can watch TWC Sports LA online, in HD. OH is not available. While it's nice they are top priority, I think I would prefer they get bumped around FSO and STO once in a while than be exclusive to 1 provider, preventing most of the city/state from seeing them at all. I don't know, maybe I should take my SD and be happy... I'm sure it could be worse."

Youngstown is already a split city between Cleveland and Pittsburgh, but there are a lot of fans who are Tribe, Browns, Cavs, Penguins (Likewise, Buccos, Steelers, Penguins, Cavs).  There isn't a huge following for the Jackets, obviously this may change that, but you are going to make a lot of Penguins fans mad if you can only show the Jackets.  As much as I love the Jackets, the Pens are far more popular in Youngstown, as they are more established and much closer to Pittsburgh than Columbus.  We should be able to watch both though."

Luckily I get both root sports and fox sports Ohio so I can watch both teams, but there's no way the penguins will give up broadcasting rights to these counties.

I'd be shocked if they weren't considered to be almost ""locks"" as well.   I know the GMs and Coaching Staff have said that they certainly still need to work hard to earn their NHL-level playing time, but we all know it would take an absolutely brilliant performance in training camp and the pre-season by other players for Wennberg and Dano to start the reason without making the big club.  The other players I can see that actually could give them a run for their money are Rychel, Bjorkstrand, and Hannikainen. But it's also possible we could end up trading some forwards for help on defense and then these other players are in the driver's seat for their own NHL-level spots on the roster."

Same goes for JJ. He's one of the vets on the blueline with Toots, so I don't know if he stays, or we package him up and try to rebuild our defense. He doesn't have any kind of NMC/NTC in his contract so his future isn't exactly set in stone. The guys I mentioned above are guys that the club has invested a lot in, and who we believe in."

They like Cam and the way he plays, but if the have an offer to make the team better and they have to trade him to make it happen, then they will."
BlueJackets,34f6er,andrewdt10,6,Thu Apr 30 20:16:06 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna make some bold predictions here.  Jenner-Johansen-Atkinson  Anisimov-Dubinsky-Foligno  Hartnell-Wennberg-Dano  Bourque-Letestu-Clarkson  Boll  Murray-JJ  Tyutin-Savard  Provorov-Goloubef  Connauton, Prout  Bobrovsky  CMac  1) Calvert is gone. I think a team with the cap space and need for a young, good 3rd liner offers him an offer sheet that we choose to not match. We pick up a compensatory 2nd round pick and part ways.  2) Letestu is, in fact, re-signed. Calvert leaving via offer sheet allows the space for Letestu's pay day.  3) Bourque and Clarkson might not be much better than Morin/Boll but their absurd contracts force them into the lineup for a couple reasons. A) Management wants to get SOMETHING out of their money. B) HCTR wants to see if he can get them going and maybe move them higher up in the lineup if they take their chances and run with it. If successful they can improve our scoring depth or prove to be movable ""assets"".  4) Anisimov is on the team. For now. He goes at or before the TDL.  5) Tropp, Skille, etc. are all gone/sent to Cleveland. Karlsson/Chaput/Anderson mature some more in the AHL rather than see 4th line/healthy scratch duty in Cbus. Morin is either sent down or leaves via trade/waivers. Not that impressive but still has value. Clearly Boll is worth keeping over him.  6) Tyutin is also on the team. For now. Think he's gone during or before the summer of 2016 though. Potentially goes in the same deal with Arty.  7) Murray, being by far our best Dman when healthy, assumes the role of #1 with JJ providing solid play as his partner. Murray's play might dip as a result of increased responsibility but hopefully JJ's reduced responsibility helps him improve and negate the temporary dip in Murray's play.  8) Provorov is drafted (maybe at 8th, maybe we trade up). He turns out to be NHL ready but we shelter him rather than give him the full Ekblad treatment. Plays point on the PP alongside Murray, JJ, and Savard.  9) Goloubef seemed to have a mini breakout last season. He can be a solid bottom pairing RHD that compliments Provorov nicely. Ideally he has a season similar to Dalton Prout's 2012/13 season.  10) Connauton is the 7th D, making him our best 7th D in a long time. He's a 3rd pairing offensive D who got hot last season. Defensively he's still not that good but he's a solid replacement on the PP in case of injury.   11) Prout becomes the 8th D. CBJ go with 8 D on the roster because why lose Prout to waivers or trade him for something of little consequence? He makes a perfectly good depth/rotation defender.  12) CMac is, in fact, re-signed. His play along the stretch was inspiring and hopefully he can continue his serviceable play next season. Not a stud backup by any means but he's a great option for this club. He's cheap, he's cool with playing a very low amount of games per year (assuming Bob is healthy), and he bridges the gap between now and Forsberg/Korpisalo/Dansk being NHL ready."
BlueJackets,34f6er,WannabeFinn,2,Thu Apr 30 19:06:41 2015 UTC,"I like everything you say, except for Boll. I'd rather buy him out or send him to play in Cleveland and keep Morin up with the club. I'm not convinced about getting rid of Calvert, either. The guy played a limited amount of games due to injury, but he was just fantastic when he played (13-10-23 in 56 games and a positive +/- with 4th line minutes). He hasn't made any great strides in terms of goals and points from season to season, but he is one of the best productive players we've had on the 4th line and his contract was incredibly cheap. If they do re-sign him, I expect it to be within the $1-2 mil aav range."
BlueJackets,34f6er,andrewdt10,2,Thu Apr 30 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"I'd rather do that too with Boll, but my predictions are based off of what I think will happen rather than what I want them to do."
BlueJackets,34f6er,WannabeFinn,2,Thu Apr 30 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. What makes me hope they'll get rid of Boll (by trade or buyout), is that they had him as a healthy scratch for the last several games in favor of a Calvert-Letestu-Morin line that was performing rather well."
BlueJackets,34f6er,andrewdt10,2,Thu Apr 30 20:26:05 2015 UTC,I haven't done the calculations for it but I'm 99.9% sure it'd be better for us to bury Boll in the minors rather than buy him out. Of course he'd be taking an AHL roster spot from a prospect or other vet like Ryan Craig unless he's also a healthy scratch down there.
BlueJackets,34f6er,WannabeFinn,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:22:32 2015 UTC,"As long as they don't play him at the NHL level, I guess I can't complain. He's just not good enough anymore."

BlueJackets,34f6er,jpsquill,1 point,Sun May 3 07:29:48 2015 UTC,"Haha wow, I've read numerous times here on reddit that he did have a no movement clause. If not he should have been sent down a while ago!"
BlueJackets,34f6er,AutomatonFood,2,Sun May 3 13:53:42 2015 UTC,"Offer sheets are so incredibly rare nowadays... expecting Matt Calvert to get one is even more unlikely as the team would match and trade him for better value.  Offer sheets are better used on guys who are slated to ring the bell on a team that has cap issues. Calvert is neither that player, nor are we that team."
BlueJackets,34f6er,nunoveaux,1 point,Fri May 1 05:59:19 2015 UTC,I genuinely don't think it's that farfetched for Calvert to receive an offer sheet of $3m x 4+ years. Some team out there who likes what he is now and thinks he can be even better will have no problem giving up a 2nd for him. He's the type of player that would give Arizona/Buffalo/Edmonton really good scoring depth and a plausible fill-in for top-6 duty.
BlueJackets,34f6er,WannabeFinn,2,Fri May 1 06:14:05 2015 UTC,"At the same time, Columbus holds all the leverage in that they are not against the cap and would match. Then, after they match, they can go back to the team(s) seeking to offer sheet him and ask for more than just a 2nd.  On top of all of that, take a look at the list of players offer sheeted.  Is Matt Calvert a guy that is either going to ask for way more money than he's worth (likely no), a player on a team who is due a major pay raise that is also up against the cap (definitely no), or is a player that is more covetable than a lot of the other RFA/UFA/Trade options out there (i don't think so)?  This all assumes that Calvert's value is at that watermark.  Is it?  I'm not so sure."
BlueJackets,34f6er,nunoveaux,1 point,Fri May 1 18:44:34 2015 UTC,"Even if we pay Calvert what he's worth (let's just say 2.5m x 3 years) I don't think he's ""worth"" that to the team anymore. His role has been reduced to 4th line when we're healthy and it's only going to stay that way with the waves of young guys like Rychel, Milano, Bjorkstrand, Anderson, etc. coming through the pipeline as wingers.  Perhaps it's more feasible that there's a sign and trade or trading of rights rather than an offer sheet but I really don't think he's gonna be here much longer unless he signs dirt cheap."
BlueJackets,34f6er,WannabeFinn,1 point,Fri May 1 19:16:46 2015 UTC,Oh I agree with you -- I just think he's moved before an offer sheet were to happen.
BlueJackets,34f6er,nunoveaux,1 point,Fri May 1 23:57:12 2015 UTC,"As much as I don't like the idea of Calvert leaving, the numbers make sense in order to keep Letestu. If Calvert could take face-offs and play the Center position like Letestu, we'd probably see him staying and Letestu leaving. I agree with you on just about everything that is likely to happen, provided we get Provorov and he is NHL ready. Unless Reilly decides to sign with us -- still holding out hope for another month. I too have a feeling they will keep Boll as an extra forward (unfortunately) instead of waiving him or buying him out of his contract."
BlueJackets,34f6er,XdefeatsY,3,Fri May 1 15:53:56 2015 UTC,"I can see Cam being traded sometime in the offseason. More than likely during the 1st round of the draft. Same with Arty. I feel like they would have signed Letestu already. I know contract negotiations haven't started (that we know of) for both him and Calvert but they shouldn't be that hard to sign.  Jarmo and JD have said that they will give Boll one more chance during training camp. They have told him in the exit interviews what he has to do in the offseason to get better. His main issue is speed. He wont get any faster. If he was 21, maybe he would be able to but I dont see that happening. He will be bought out after training camp, but before the season starts. Anderson will be on the 4th line because of his size. I'd like to see Bjorkstrand on the top line or whichever line Dubi is on. Keep the Hartnell-Wennberg-Dano line the same. If Letestu doesn't sign, then put Chaput as the 4th line center. Not sure what to do about Clarkson and Bourque. Also if Reilly signs then trade Tyutin and keep Golobeuf."
BlueJackets,34f6er,CBJFAN10,2,Thu Apr 30 17:59:30 2015 UTC,I felt like Bourque really wanted to be there and was really meshing with his unit before he got hurt.  I saw him in Carolina in March and he looked pretty solid.
BlueJackets,34f6er,collink,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:57:47 2015 UTC,"He could better (4-0-4 in 8 games), but he was definitely giving it the effort he needed while he was healthy. The only thing I wondered is what if his scoring was only a by-product of playing on a line with Joey. Would he be able to produce without playing on the 1st line."
BlueJackets,34f6er,andrewdt10,2,Thu Apr 30 20:22:11 2015 UTC,"Morin will start in the NHL next season. So will Clarkson. And Boll.  Bourque could go either way, AHL or NHL. Some of those four are gonna end up being healthy scratched though.  Skille won't be back, Falk might not be back (he's an RFA, so he might stick around), Letestu possibly won't be back, although I hope he is.   Tropp will hopefully not see any NHL time next season and will get stuck in Lake Erie.  It's probable that a trade will happen, so maybe Arty won't be around either, and maybe a prospect or two may be gone. That's still tough to speculate on at this point.  Goloubef is a UFA, so we'll have to see what happens with him. I wouldn't mind keeping him around for another year.  Bjorkstrand and Milano will more than likely play for the Monsters next year, unless one of them has a really good camp, or, god forbid, the injury bug strikes again. Anderson will probably end up in Lake Erie too. Same goes for Wild Bill Karlsson.  Chaput is an RFA, so he'll probably end up in the AHL again.  It will be interesting to see what happens with Rychel. He seems to be ready for the NHL, but there's limited space for him. I suppose it's also possible he could be the one used as a piece in a bigger deal to trade for a defenseman this offseason. We'll see."
BlueJackets,34f6er,jpsquill,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:29:42 2015 UTC,"I personally think we will see almost the same team back at the beginning of next season as we did here at the end of this season. I still think the team will either get rid of Boll or keep him as an extra forward, and that we will re-sign Calvert and Letestu.  However, we have a forward problem, in terms of a log jam, and a defense problem, in terms of a lack of great players. I can see Anisimov and/or Atkinson being traded for defensive help (an established player or player on the verge). That would give us a chance to work out our log jam at the forward position while helping the team on defense."
BlueJackets,34f6er,andrewdt10,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:24:59 2015 UTC,Boll will not be in a cbj sweater ever again.  No offense to him...I appreciate what he's done for us but we have out grown him...two years ago...
BlueJackets,34f24j,jpsquill,6,Thu Apr 30 16:43:42 2015 UTC,"Well, you wouldn't get Reilly because he may or may not sign with us.  Honestly, I don't see the Jackets trading up to 5th unless Hanifin falls that far, and then maybe they would try making a move. As much as I'm interested in Marner, I can't really see them trading up to draft another center, and chances are that at least one other highly touted defensive prospect will be available at 8th that they could take."
BlueJackets,34f24j,jpsquill,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"I don't see Provorov falling past Philadelphia, and I'm not a huge fan of Werenski but that's just my opinion...who else is there at #8?  I would be perfectly fine with Rantanen or Crouse though. A huge supporting winger would be an amazing addition that we're currently missing from the forward corps."
BlueJackets,34f24j,notwhoithink,9,Thu Apr 30 17:02:18 2015 UTC,"If Provorov is off the board by the 8th pick, and Rantanen is still on the board, then I would be okay with them drafting him over Werenski, but I still wouldn't mind him either. I'm not a huge fan of the idea of drafting Crouse if he's available.   I just think it would better suit the Jackets to hold on to Anisimov and use him to create a package to trade for a bonafide top 4 defenseman, which would be far more beneficial than trading up three spots for a position that they aren't dying to have at the moment."

Also, if he isn't going to be able to control his emotions, and this is any indication of the type of player he might become, then I would be fine with passing on him. That may have been just a one time thing, but it was dirty nonetheless."

BlueJackets,34f24j,notwhoithink,2,Fri May 1 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Makes a lot of sense to me for NJD to take Barzal and Philly to take Rantanen/Zacha. Both have a pretty good group of young D and desperately need more forward talent (NJD more so than Philly, of course).  Kinda funny actually, it's not that crazy to think Hanifin could make a Cam Fowler-esque fall to 8th overall. McD, Eichel, Strome, and Marner could all easily go top 4 and Crouse, Barzal, Rantanen/Zacha could fill out the top 7. Of course, you'd think someone would stop and say ""yeah we need top forward talent but Hanifin is still on the board"", but that's not necessarily guaranteed to happen. Cam Fowler as mentioned above and Seth Jones dropped a good bit more than anyone really expected them to."

San Jose traded a 2nd to move up from 20th to 18th overall in the 2013 draft to ensure we wouldn't pick Mueller before they had the chance to. And look, I love Arty as a player and would be perfectly fine with keeping him around for next season... Carolina has even more centers than we do anyways but he is expendable. His value is a high 2nd round pick at most in the first place.  I don't think the extra assets we would give up would be that hard to replace internally."
BlueJackets,34f24j,CBJFan,4,Fri May 1 00:35:21 2015 UTC,"San Jose traded a 2nd to move up from 20th to 18th overall in the 2013 draft   They threw in a late 2nd round pick to move up only two positions in the first round.  You're suggesting that we should throw in a late 2nd round pick, a solid roster player, and an outstanding prospect to move up three positions?  You don't see why that sounds like madness?  Sure, there's a difference between going from 20th to 18th versus going from 8th to 5th, but not so much to warrant that kind of a haul."
BlueJackets,34f24j,nunoveaux,0,Fri May 1 00:51:23 2015 UTC,"An outstanding prospect? Zaar would have trouble cracking our top 15 list in the first place(what 5 points in the whole second half of the season?) and Reilly is a longshot to sign here, I think we all know that.   I don't have a problem with keeping all of the pieces I suggested moving but it's not like I'm proposing we bend ourselves over backwards for them. It's close in value and you might be overrating these selections.   There IS a huge difference in value between the ~20th overall picks and the top 5. It would require more than a late 2nd round pick to move up.  http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/draft/draft_by_pick.php?position=8  8 overall doesn't look too appealing compared to #5 historically"

As I said, I know that there's a big difference between 20th/8th and 18th/5th, and I agree that it's probably worth more than a late 2nd rounder (which will probably be 60th overall, if my bracket pans out).  But I don't think that it's worth two more players.  It is still only 3 positions.  It's not like we would be moving into ""can't miss"" territory.  The players likely to be available at 5th are not especially better than those likely to be available at 8th.  Yeah, we've got the parts to spare but we could use them better in a trade for a defenseman."

Otherwise a signed Reilly does have way way more value than Zaar who I consider like a throw-in like Mattias Backman in the Erik Cole trade.   I guess it's me who values Arty way less than anyone else on /r/bluejackets since I doubt anyone would reject the deal without him included. Ah well I tried"
BlueJackets,34f24j,Big_Green_Piccolo,5,Thu Apr 30 18:49:32 2015 UTC,"I'm only trading up in this draft if I'm Jarmo for Hanifin or Provorov and I don't think Provorov is in danger at 5th overall.

BlueJackets,349wd2,GeekYogurt,17,Wed Apr 29 13:37:44 2015 UTC,I'm perfectly fine with keeping Mac for another season if he can play like he did down the stretch when Bob was out. He and his family love it here as I've heard as well. Throw ~ a million at him for a year as a competent backup.   I don't think any of our guys in the pipeline are quite ready to step up full time in the big league. We saw how Forsberg played when he was given his chances earlier this year.
BlueJackets,349wd2,SomeKindOfMonster,9,Wed Apr 29 13:48:49 2015 UTC,"Few issues here:   Forsberg and Dansk are a few years away from being NHLers in a permanent capacity.  UFA Class for backups isn't very impressive. Hammond was a sub-900 goalie before his callup and he hasn't been the only goalie to be a flash-in-the-pan. (Andrew Raycroft).   For as much flack as Mac got earlier this year, I  believe he's the best option in net at backup.   It's also worth pointing out that when this team cut Garon loose to fortify Mason, the position continued to erode until one Sergei Bobrovsky was acquired to stabilize the position.  EDIT: another thought too... Getting another backup is going to need to be an upgrade at that position if they go this route. With Bob's contract, are we comfortable having that much money tied up in the goalie position when the real issue is the defense in front of them?"
BlueJackets,349wd2,nunoveaux,5,Wed Apr 29 15:13:28 2015 UTC,"All fair points.   We don't know which Hammond will show up next year. He would be a giant risk... as a starter.

You couldn't fathom that being said about Dubnyk."
BlueJackets,349wd2,nunoveaux,9,Wed Apr 29 21:09:46 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who felt like C-Mac held it down pretty well for us in our time of need when Bobs broke his hand?
BlueJackets,349wd2,NLP19,7,Wed Apr 29 16:00:56 2015 UTC,During Bob's first injury no. During the second injury and in his backup role he played dramatically better.  IIRC he was falling on bad tendencies early on and GCIC had to work with him to fix them.
BlueJackets,349wd2,THECapedCaper,8,Wed Apr 29 21:12:07 2015 UTC,"I would rather he hit the McMarket. Not a fan of CMac, but I do appreciate what he was able to do at times covering for Bob."

I saw most of his run and I don't think it was a fluke (the AHL team he was on is really bad) but I also don't think he's going to be lights-out amazing going forward. I'd guess around average to lower-end starter material. And Forsberg just doesn't seem ready. If we can give Mac a one or two year extension to give Anton more time, we should go for it imo."
BlueJackets,349wd2,Lyun,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:24:54 2015 UTC,"Keep McElhinney. Dude did pretty good this year while Bob was out. If he only had a better D in front of him, we might have just had a slightly better year. Who knows? We may have squeaked into the post-season."
BlueJackets,349wd2,Nothing_is_Free,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:30:02 2015 UTC,"I think the thing we suffered from most is that our team didn't trust him as much.  It seems like we play a MUCH different game in front of Mac than Bob.  The whole time Bob was out (the second time at least...), we seemed to turtle a lot more and play more passive, like we didn't trust him to come up big if the play broke and the opposition sprung a guy on a break.  Never saw that with Bob in goal...  I felt like a lot of those games he was in and we lost, the lack of aggression that we had really hurt us."

BlueJackets,341uj0,jpsquill,6,Mon Apr 27 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"Lame :(. Wall 'o text for you then!  As the Blue Jackets' off-season ticks along, we'll unload our notebooks of stuff that deserves more texture and explanation, or perhaps little bits that don't quite justify a full story. Here is the first edition:  -- The Blue Jackets affiliation agreement with Lake Erie has been dissected from the Blue Jackets' perspective and from the Monsters' perspective. On Thursday, when the announcement was made official, I tried to explore it from the players' perspective. Nothing against Springfield -- the people, the building, the city were all great -- but Cleveland has all of the makings to be one of the gems of the AHL.  Let us count the ways:   The Monsters are owned by billionaire Dan Gilbert, who also owns the Cavs, an Arena League football team and an NBA development league team. He wants to win at everything he does, and those around the organization say the organization -- both on an off the ice -- is run very much like a major-league team. Neither Monsters nor Gilbert pay any of the players' salaries -- those are on the Blue Jackets -- but they can surround the franchise with all they need to be successful. And, apparently, they do. Cleveland has an NBA, NFL and major-league baseball franchise, and it has the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. It has a busy downtown, a recovering arts scene and lots of living options close to the rink. This could make the Blue Jackets an attractive option for veteran AHL free agents who still harbor NHL dreams. These are mostly young players, guys looking for something to do in those many ""off"" hours. Cleveland, along with Toronto, Chicago, San Antonio and Charlotte are among the ""major"" cities in the minor league. Here's Blue Jackets assistant general manager Chris MacFarland: ""If you're an NHL/AHL call-up guy, the idea of being 2 1/2 hours away from the parent club is great, especially if you have a family. Some of these guys are in situations where they live in the AHL city. But when they get called up -- which is what they're playing, right? -- they're hours and hours away and it's hard for their families to get there to watch them play or stay with them. That means a lot to guys."" The Monsters drew an average of 8,000 fans per game this season, according to the Monsters. Don't know how many of those tickets were purchased, or if the house was papered, but in this respect it doesn't really matter. It's considered a very good place to play. The same people who run game ops for the Cavaliers run game ops for the Monsters, so the production and the amp-up atmosphere is very much NHL. (I don't know this first-hand, being honest. But that seems the consensus.) Springfield is in a unique spot, so centrally located among AHL franchises that the Falcons rarely spend the night on the road. That's right, the Falcons sleep in their own beds almost every night after they bus in and bus out of games. Blue Jackets veteran AHL forward Ryan Craig estimated 12-13 hotel nights this entire season. That's a month at the NHL level. While that ease of travel can sound pretty appealing, there are times when a team needs to get away -- like, really get away -- as a team. Players who make the move from Springfield to Lake Erie will get a much more NHL-like travel schedule. Quicken Loans Arena is one of only four NBA/NHL arenas in use by AHL teams. Big building, nice dressing room, all the amentities. I don't pretend to know all of the AHL rinks -- sadly, I've only been in a few of them -- but the Monsters' dressing room is pretty nice place to be.   Side dishes -- It's hard to look back on the Blue Jackets' season without the ungodly wave of injuries casting a sheen on everything. But if you watched this club closely this season -- and the previous two, for that matter -- you know that there's more to the inconsistent play and intermittent passion than simply gauze pad and stitches. We will explore this in Sunday's editions of The Dispatch. Why does this club only go hard when it's back is to the wall? It might be as big an issue as the injuries themselves.  -- AHL clubs have an intense interest in keeping operating costs to a minimum. So don't expect Lake Erie, even if they remain in the Western Conference, to make routine trips to the Pacific Coast to play those clubs that took part in the Westward Ho! movement to California cities like San Diego, Stockton, Bakersfield, Ontario and San Jose. Much like Springfield seemed to always play Hartford, Albany and Bridgeport. Get ready for a healthy dose of Chicago, Milwaukee, and Rockford matchups.  -- Doesn't appear to be any movement in resigning center Mark Letestu, a pending UFA this summer. Blue Jackets GM Jarmo Kekalainen is in Switzerland right now, scouring and scouting the World U-18 championships.  -- Cleveland is a very interesting NHL market. Who do they root for? I know Cleveland residents who are Penguins fans, which -- given that city's history with the Steelers -- seems incomprehensible to me, but Pittsburgh (133 miles) is the closest NHL market to Cleveland, and they've won Stanley Cups. Yes, Columbus (141) is a longer drive, as is Buffalo (190 miles). The Blue Jackets' haven't had any playoff runs or enough moments big enough to register all the way up I-71, and Blue Jackets' gear isn't easy enough to find. The young people in Cleveland appear to be Blue Jackets fans or free agents, looking for somebody to earn their fanaticism. The older set may shade toward the Penguins, but there are Red Wings fans in there, too.  -- Remember when the Columbus Clippers were affiliated with the New York Yankees. It was an awkward relationship for many local baseball fans, who found themselves supporting Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams, Mariano Rivera, etc., until that moment when they were called up to the Yankees. For that reason, some just couldn't cheer for the Clippers. Central Ohio is filled with Reds and Indians fans ... no way they'd continue to cheer for a &#$*(@ Yankee. It wasn't quite that awkward in Cleveland these past few years, but it was still tough for fans to watch the Lake Erie Monsters, get attached to the players and then watch them go on to play for the ... Colorado Avalanche? Beyond the emotional grip, it was literally hard to watch former Monsters play at Avalanche unless you have the NHL's Center Ice package. It's now perfectly natural for Indians fans in central Ohio to cheer for the Clippers. So it should be for Cleveland hockey fans.  -- Falcons captain Ryan Craig said he will definitely consider remaining with the organization, which is good news. This guy is a tremendous leader. While the Blue Jackets haven't had a captain in almost three years, the Falcons have had a great one in Craig. It would be a big hit if he gets away. Also, you'd have to think local boy Trent Vogelhuber would jump at a chance to play pro hockey in his home state. His AHL contract is up this summer.  -- The Blue Jackets will likely stock the Monsters with some serious talent next season, or at least some serious prospects. Forwards Oliver Bjorkstrand, Sonny Milano and Kerby Rychel, defensemen Dillon Heatherington and Blake Siebenaler, and goaltender Anton Forsberg are among the youngsters likely to play by the lake next season.  -- One thing the NHL, the Blue Jackets and the folks in Cleveland will need to work on: local TV rights areas in the NHL. The league has always been a bit sketchy talking about such matters, but there are parts of Northeast Ohio -- about a dozen counties, in fact -- where Blue Jackets games are blacked out on at least some TV providers because those areas are deemed to be ""Penguins"" territory. (There are also counties in NW Ohio that are deemed Red Wings territory.) But imagine Monsters fans from say, Stark Co., being blacked out of watching Blue Jackets games because they live in Ohio Penguin territory. I get the sense this might be changing. The name of Fox Sports Ohio senior vice president and GM Francois McGillicuddy was called out more than a few times during Thursday's presser.  -- Top 5 favorite name of all-time: Francois McGillicuddy  -- Aaron Portzline"

I HATE that team up north; that's much more then a rivalry.   That being said. I think it's just everyone in the hockey world like to see Crosby fail because he's such a whiner; Pittsburgh excluded.

They're probably already tired with Detroit for the most hated team that we play. The playoffs last year are another reason to hate them. The fact that we won the regular season series this year swings the pendulum the other way. IMO, it won't take much of that to get the feelings flowing in the other direction."

Are injuries enough of a negative to exclude someone from captain candidacy? Seems to be the main thing working against Dubi.   Dubi and JJ have been regarded as the voice in that locker room for the past few years, so we need to ask - do we all want Foligno because he had a breakout season or due to his actual leadership qualities? It's not like these leadership qualities have changed much over the past couple years, so why did we never consider Foligno a legit candidate before? Just want to hear some thoughts."
BlueJackets,33q4p4,AKlep,6,Fri Apr 24 16:51:41 2015 UTC,"He embodies the spirit of the team and is the person I would want as the face of CBJ. Just watch interviews with the guy. He loves this city, he loves the team. The fact that he had a good season is a bonus. A captain should more than just a skilled player. /u/BSantry and /u/stupidchange nailed it."
BlueJackets,33q4p4,hryhoriyy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"But imo Dubi does all of that too. We just didn't see it enough this season because of him being injured most of the season. From a fan's point of view because we don't have access to the day to day locker room atmosphere, both are equally capable of fulfilling our captaincy role."
BlueJackets,33q4p4,iamamystery20,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:56:33 2015 UTC,"I still hold strong to my argument of Dubi being too hot headed to be a solid captain. That kind of passion I think is better for the ones wearing the A. Captain needs to be the one that's ""never too high, never too low"""
BlueJackets,33q4p4,BSantry,2,Mon Apr 27 11:54:33 2015 UTC,"While that's a valid point, there was also part of the fanbase (me included) saying that Dubi has heart and he has leadership, but he is way too hot-headed to be captain.  That's why he's a solid choice to wear an A in my book.  He's got heart and grit and can get really riled up and lose his shit without losing any respect as a captain.    I've always believed Foligno was a solid leader and very level headed.  If anyone listens to the Marek vs Wyshynski podcast, which I highly recommend, Ryan Johanson was on a few weeks ago.  When asked about Foligno, he said that Nick is the one to always have a smile on his face and a chin-up attitude, no matter how bad things get (such as that sucktastic suck streak where we sucked earlier this season.)  That is the kind of captain I would like to have, one that doesn't fall into a slump and always sees the bright side.  The one that can motivate and say ""We can do better, we will do better.""  Him having an awesome season is just icing on the cake."

BlueJackets,33q4p4,BSantry,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:24:13 2015 UTC,"So you think rather than everyone getting overzealous for Foligno this year, everyone was getting overzealous for Dubinsky last year?"
BlueJackets,33q4p4,AKlep,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:42:19 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say people were overzealous either then or now. But Dubinsky was in the spotlight last year so there was increased focus. This year that guy is Foligno so naturally there's more chatter about it.
BlueJackets,33q4p4,BSantry,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:07:06 2015 UTC,Luongo was the captain of the Canucks for a while; he just couldn't serve as the captain for any on-ice purposes.
BlueJackets,33q4p4,ranatalus,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:29:40 2015 UTC,This article makes a point worth mentioning - everyone (including this sub) was begging for Dubinsky to be the captain before this season in the same way we are begging for Foligno be captain before next season.    That's the CBJ fan base.  They want whoever happens to be having a good season to be the captain.  Then when someone else has a good season they want them to have it.
BlueJackets,33q4p4,notwhoithink,2,Fri Apr 24 17:24:06 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm sort of getting at. What about Foligno's leadership has changed in the past 2 years? I don't think much has, so I'm beginning to think this cry for Foligno to be captain is due to his breakout season and Dubinsky's injuries."
BlueJackets,33q4p4,AKlep,16,Fri Apr 24 17:29:02 2015 UTC,"The thing that has changed about Foligno is all about where his head is as a professional. He had the biggest scare a parent can have and it put his place in the game into perspective. Foligno has always had the tools to be good, but he always put too much pressure on himself when things went bad. Now, he understands that things going ""bad"" on the ice means a whole lot less than things going bad in life. His perspective has changed and he's finally realizing the full package he's always had in him. He comes to the rink every day happy to be there, and he leaves whatever is wrong there when he goes home.   That's why I want him as a captain. He's young enough to relate to the kids, and has enough hockey cred that vets will listen to him. And he is so positive, that he rubs off on everyone, including us fans. Being the captain of a hockey team shouldn't only relate to on ice performance. Teams that just name their best player captain usually collapse. See; Lindros, Eric and Nash, Rick.  I am a hockey coach, and I tend to rely on the guy in the room that everyone listens to. The one that doesn't get too high or too low. The guy that supports the guys who are struggling, and gets the one who are succeeding to open up and talk about what's working.  Simply put, I want to rely on the guy that I want my other players to emulate. And in that locker room, I'd want the players to emulate Nick. And that has nothing to do with stats."
BlueJackets,33q4p4,stupidchange,5,Fri Apr 24 18:13:37 2015 UTC,"This a great response. This is what I was trying to elicit with my original comment. I just want to make sure there are legitimate reasons for everyone being behind him as captain. To play devils advocate, what leadership qualities does Foligno have that Dubinsky doesn't?"
BlueJackets,33q4p4,AKlep,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:45:45 2015 UTC,I think the only difference is that it seems way harder to get Foligno to chase you around the ice slashing at your ankles...
BlueJackets,33q4p4,43goalie,2,Sat Apr 25 16:24:10 2015 UTC,"Could be.  I've always been a fan of Foligno.  He comes from a good hockey family, has good hockey sense, and has rarely been in ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"".  I think that he flew below the radar on the lower lines precisely because he could be depended on to not screw up, yet would still deliver timely goals.  But that's all about his play.  The real factor is his presence in the locker room, and I've got no idea how much that has changed this year, if any."
BlueJackets,33q4p4,notwhoithink,2,Fri Apr 24 17:50:39 2015 UTC,Exactly. I'm a fan of Foligno. I'm a fan of Dubinsky. I would be fine if either donned the C. I'm just trying to figure out what caused the shift of Dubinsky support to Foligno support.
BlueJackets,33q4p4,AKlep,7,Fri Apr 24 18:48:01 2015 UTC,"I don't really think Foligno will regress so hard that it'll make him not a candidate. He's got good chemistry with most of the forwards, especially RyJo, and if those two are together you're going to see 60-70 point out of both of them."

BlueJackets,33q4p4,laxpulse,3,Fri Apr 24 22:49:02 2015 UTC,Idk about the bridge for boone idea but I still think management wants to see leadership qualities from Boone so he can lead the team.

BlueJackets,33q4p4,highvoltorb,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:31:35 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in this bet too; fairest way to do it is probably just by points per game.  Foligno had 73 points in 79 games for .924 PPG this season; I'd give you wiggle room and say he won't top .9 PPG (which would be 74 points in 82 games; technically 73.8 but if we're doing a bet, I'm not rounding)."
BlueJackets,33q4p4,ranatalus,3,Mon Apr 27 22:30:51 2015 UTC,"Anyone else think Wiz would've made a fine captain?  No point lamenting what could've been.  The thing for me, and IMO the reason that we haven't had a captain since Nash, is that the captaincy isn't something that's just given out, nor is it voted upon.  It's something that is seized.  A captain needs to know he's the helmsman of the ship, and he needs to know when to simply grab the wheel and steer.  I think the reason that the C didn't appear this year is that no individual rose above the rest last year and demanded to be captain.  Dubi and JJ are both fantastic leaders and either would be a suitable captain for CBJ, but neither of them seized the opportunity.  The opportunity won't present itself, the captain needs to create it.  That brings me to my point.  Foligno created the opportunity and seized it this year.  With the injuries, the hardship, and everything else this team has gone through, Foligno not only stepped his game up but he, IMO, put the C on his own chest (figuratively) and led this team through one of the toughest yet most memorable seasons.  He is one of the major reasons this team felt like a winner, rather than a team that picks 8th in the draft.  Look at the picture in the sidebar.  Is there any question who stands out?  After every game, what do you look forward to (the correct answer is ""The Hug"")?  Foligno won't be made captain.  He made himself captain a long time ago and that's why he deserves it."

At the game, a dude next to us bought a giant bucket of popcorn.  Down 3-2 in the 3rd, I looked at him and said ""you know if they score, you're gonna have to toss that.""

Would NOT be surprised if we're getting new kit."
BlueJackets,33jog0,flyerfanatic93,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:43:12 2015 UTC,I can't imagine that we do. The team has only been around 15 seasons and they've already had two complete sets of jerseys. Is to soon to change again.

BlueJackets,33a3gz,Beartoes1,6,Mon Apr 20 21:30:52 2015 UTC,I think these are the most logical based on who will probably be gone at 8.

Something like Anisimov + Karlsson + #8 + 2nd round. I could see them making that deal unless they're really insistent on Strome."
BlueJackets,33a3gz,TheDoubleL27,11,Tue Apr 21 02:06:20 2015 UTC,What you're offering Arizona is too much IMO especially because in my mind I see Hanifin slipping to 5th overall. Wouldn't cost nearly as much to trade with Carolina then.
BlueJackets,33a3gz,WannabeFinn,6,Tue Apr 21 04:20:04 2015 UTC,"If we sit at 8th, I hope we end up with Provorov. If not him, Werenski. If not him, Rantanen and Barzal are forwards I would be delighted with.  We're guaranteed at least 1 of those guys to be on the board still, essentially.

Listed at 6-2, 185 lbs. Was part of team's development camp last summer, played for Jokerit. Jarmo is quite familiar with Hannikainen's game. He came up through the Jokerit program while Jarmo was the GM there.  Jarmo likes his Finns."
BlueJackets,339hn3,springinslicht,6,Mon Apr 20 18:46:33 2015 UTC,He could be a great bottom-6 player in the NHL in a few years. He's a physical 'powerforward' but also showed a lot of points production potential this year. Fast skater and great work ethic too.
BlueJackets,339hn3,jpsquill,5,Mon Apr 20 19:41:42 2015 UTC,Interesting move. I'm just glad he's not another center. I guess more wing depth can't hurt.

BlueJackets,339hn3,TheDoubleL27,5,Mon Apr 20 18:56:09 2015 UTC,More likely a depth move where he'll be assigned to the AHL incase of injuries to our wingers again.

BlueJackets,339cjj,GeekYogurt,8,Mon Apr 20 18:40:13 2015 UTC,I think it's pretty much a given that he'll be with the Monsters next season.

As far as I know the major injury in his last year of juniors was a shoulder injury, he was healthy for a lot of 13-14 and this year he had various freak injuries to both legs and not just at the knee.

BlueJackets,332v6c,Buckfisher,19,Sun Apr 19 02:04:27 2015 UTC,Edmonton is such a waste. Would have rather seen Buffalo or Arizona.
BlueJackets,332v6c,VirtuaSaturn,0,Sun Apr 19 00:19:56 2015 UTC,"Buffalo, absolutely! Although their fans can cram it with walnuts when they invade NWA, I respect them and feel like being a Columbus/Cleveland fan makes one kindred spirits with the people of upstate NY. But I'll have to respectfully disagree on the second point -- the only pick the Coyotes need to lock down is to choose whether they'd like to move to Seattle or Quebec."
BlueJackets,332v6c,jpsquill,0,Mon Apr 20 05:06:57 2015 UTC,"I think that's exactly why Arizona needed to win the lottery. If they would have been able to draft McDavid, he could have possibly been the piece to revitalize their franchise and put more asses in the seats, and expand hockey in the desert. It would have been a great boost for them."
BlueJackets,332v6c,VirtuaSaturn,2,Mon Apr 20 19:09:24 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, but I'd prefer to simply divorce hockey & desert. The good people of Seattle need them a franchise and things just aren't working out in Glendale."

BlueJackets,32yzdo,nykc,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:23:28 2015 UTC,"I just started skating from watching my sons lessons. He is in Hockey 1 and 9. Currently I am at a situation where I would love to learn and play, but I have no skates of my own. (rentals suck) and I can skate without falling! Basically I am like Happy Gilmore out there.   That being said I would totally be up for doing this, but it would probably be in my best interest to start collecting gear and preparing for this so I am not dropping 1,000 up front.   I do want to play before I get too much older. Currently 37"
BlueJackets,32yzdo,junk-trunk,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:30:41 2015 UTC,"Well, we need a big, booming slap shot from the point!  Sounds like you're not interested in this session, but here's some advice for whenever you play:  You can get good cheap, used gear at Play It Again Sports (Not Reynoldsburg store), Craigslist and eBay. I wouldn't go cheap on ice skates; they're worth a long-term investment. Everything else You can get for under $200. So $400 for gear with new skates, $45 USA registration good for the year, $220 team/league fees and a nominal jersey fee, you're looking at around $700. That stings a bit, but once you pay for the gear, you're next session is just $220-ish. The first session is always the worse.   Also, don't let age or skill level hold you back. I've plaid with people PLENTY older than 37. I just asked a woman around that age to play just the other day. Skill will come with time and practice and practice and fun is what E League teams are for."

BlueJackets,32ux4k,Gordon13ombay,17,Fri Apr 17 01:16:14 2015 UTC,"This is really exciting news and great for the Cleveland team/promoting the parent club in another part of the state. It seems the AHL is shifting towards having the affiliates closer to the parent clubs.   In a dream scenario, I wish Cincinnati's ECHL (AA) team would affiliate with Cleveland/Columbus. Essentially you'd have the whole CBJ farm system in the state of Ohio promoting the major league club at the state's center.   To top it off - preseason games in Cincy and Cleveland would be a great thing to see.   No matter what, proud to be a Blue Jackets fan based in Cincinnati and always happy to make the trip up 71 north."
BlueJackets,32ux4k,Gordon13ombay,4,Fri Apr 17 02:14:46 2015 UTC,"It works so well in baseball, I'm glad hockey teams are making the shift as well. It makes so much sense to have farm teams in the region that you play. I love the Monsters, but why would I root for Colorado? This move pulls potential Pitt or Det fans to CBJ. This isn't just true of Cleveland, but it will bring in Akron, Canton, and Youngstown fans as well.   Same thing that you mentioned for Cincy, keep it in the state, pull away potential Chi, STL, or Preds fans."
BlueJackets,32ux4k,overcatastrophe,2,Fri Apr 17 02:21:16 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Especially with Cleveland being AHL, even if you're a casual Lake Eerie Monsters fan - if you recognize a player and he gets pulled up, you can go watch him just a few hours away in the big time."

BlueJackets,32o7gz,HORSEtheGAME,2,Wed Apr 15 16:20:31 2015 UTC,Agreed on WSH over NYI.
BlueJackets,32o7gz,XdefeatsY,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:24:54 2015 UTC,Washington in the first round. St. Louis in the first round. I honestly think that team will pull past the Wild. I also think the Jets may take the Ducks.

BlueJackets,32l8pd,xam2y,19,Tue Apr 14 19:45:02 2015 UTC,"In 2012, which is generally regarded as the turning point from suck to good, we beat the shit out of Detroit (which up until that season, they owned us). Detroit is often considered a rival around here (because they are pretentious douches and the Ohio State-Michigan rivalry) and beating them was nice. Prospal got in a fight with a Detroit player, and afterwords he pointed at the scoreboard and drew a penalty for it."
BlueJackets,32l8pd,darthgallion,9,Tue Apr 14 19:52:02 2015 UTC,"Well that and he was the cool, old vet on the team back then like Hartsy is now.

BlueJackets,32l8pd,johnny5_is_alive,4,Tue Apr 14 21:30:33 2015 UTC,this should help explain it: video thread pics
BlueJackets,32l8pd,Ohm_My_God,5,Tue Apr 14 19:50:49 2015 UTC,"That video includes why I think Ken & Mickey (announcers for the Wings) are some of the best announcers.  Sure, they're both homers but they'll point out when the other team does good or when the Wings do bad.

BlueJackets,32m5lq,Aperture-Employee,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:42:31 2015 UTC,Sedin twins forced pre-draft maneuvering but they had the option of staying in Sweden legitimately in their back pocket and their only condition was being on the same team. McDavid could do similar things but it would not serve him well. He could refuse to report and probably be fined. Or he basically has to wait 3 years to sign a pro contract. I don't believe he can go NCAA at this point.

BlueJackets,32m5lq,XdefeatsY,2,Thu Apr 16 00:21:12 2015 UTC,"If not us, I think Buffalo or Carolina. Those fans (especially Buffalo) have supported their team through some tough times. Would be nice to see them rewarded. Plus Buffalo made some nice moves, and will have solid pieces around him.  I don't want to see him in Arizona or Florida because I don't know why there are even teams there still. The locals barely support the teams during successful times and I don't like the idea of them ONLY showing back up because of one guy.  And I might die if he goes to Boston, Philly, Edmonton or Toronto. Because him getting rammed down our throats ala Crosby will be unbearable. I don't want to see those teams on national games EVERY WEEK  LA - Meh. I would love it if it leads to Carter being bumped down to a lesser role. But except for Carter, I really like LA. Love coach Dutter. He could get a lot out of the kid. Probably the best possible spot for him as a player. Besides here, of course :)"
BlueJackets,32m5lq,GeekYogurt,2,Wed Apr 15 14:46:15 2015 UTC,"If not us then: Carolina, Buffalo, New Jersey, Arizona, and Florida in that order.   The first two because the fans are there but both franchises have struggled for 5+ years to really come up with a true offensive weapon to take them to the next level and make healthy playoff runs. I don't feel like Carolina intentionally tanked and that he really has a chance to bring that franchise into a conversation with the right development. The other teams I mentioned are deserving of him too, they need that offensive weapon to spark them. However, for Buffalo and Arizona, they also need to find consistent goaltending!  I would feel so bad for him if he ended up in Toronto. That would be so unfair to him if he ended up there and didn't live up to their unrealistic expectations for his rookie season. As for the others I don't think are deserving, it's for different reasons...   Not LA: Because fuck LA, that's why. They barely missed the playoffs this year as the defending Stanley Cup champions and I just feel like him going there would be unfair. Not Philly: I feel like Philly really just needs a better coaching staff. Not Edmonton: They need consistent goaltending and better player development. I feel like they have pretty good offensive weapons already. Not Dallas: Kari Lehtonen had a sub-par year and the defense didn't play all that well in front of him. Other than that, they would be in the playoffs. Not Boston: I don't know if it's Claude Julien and his coaching staff losing the locker room or if it was Pete Chiarelli trading away some top talent the past couple seasons or a combination of the two but when Marchand is your most productive forward with 24 goals on the season, something isn't working. The defensive play in front of Tuukka was god awful this season. Boston is kind of my second team behind the Jackets because I grew up in that area before I moved to Columbus and we got the franchise here. One great young player will not solve their problems. Not Colorado: The pieces are there, they just had a rough year because of injuries. Not San Jose: Until they can figure out what the hell is wrong with whatever beef is going around between people in that organization, it would be unfair to the kid to get stuck in the middle of that. This was the first year that they missed the playoffs in a while and I just don't think they are in as much of a need as other teams."

BlueJackets,32ia9c,habituallysuspect,5,Tue Apr 14 15:53:51 2015 UTC,"Well done.   Nick's dad was always one of my favorite players, and when Nick made the NHL I watched him closely. He has that ""x factor"" that anyone who's been around hockey locker rooms knows is incredibly valuable. The ability to loosen up nervous guys and push the comfortable all without coming across as a babysitter.  The fact that he could even resume his career after that scare with the baby is amazing. To come back even stronger than before shows character beyond words.  And that is exactly the guy I want the rest of the room taking cues from. He's not the only leader. There's Boone, JJ, Dubi... But he's unquestionably the man I want the young guys looking up to.  On and off the ice."

BlueJackets,32gvtw,SomeKindOfMonster,2,Mon Apr 13 18:51:41 2015 UTC,Oh for sure. I think management realized that pretty early on during his injury that when he came back he would be lower on the totem pole to give our rookies a chance to play. He's a UFA after this year so we will see what happens to him.

BlueJackets,32e8ex,WannabeFinn,11,Mon Apr 13 01:49:24 2015 UTC,"I hope they resign him. He certainly deserves a roster spot over Clarkson, Bourque, or Boll.   Most of the year we weren't able to roll 4 lines and it hurt us.  The 2 stretches that we were most healthy and were able to roll 4 lines both resulted in winning streaks.  Letting Derek MacKenzie go last year hurt us and letting Letestu walk this year will hurt us as well."
BlueJackets,32e8ex,Rhaegar71,3,Mon Apr 13 13:03:15 2015 UTC,Letting MacKenzie go is exactly the same mistake. All the more reason to keep Letestu
BlueJackets,32e8ex,TheLastGundam186,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:30:25 2015 UTC,"Mackenzie is a professional penalty killer like letestu. Although nice to have on one's team, not a guy i want playing a regular shift off of a 4th line."

BlueJackets,32e8ex,HermanBonJovi,7,Tue Apr 14 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"Based on his comments, it just feels like Management is moving on without him.  Disappointing if true, we'd be putting a lot of stock in Wennberg not hitting a sophomore slump."
BlueJackets,32e8ex,nunoveaux,7,Mon Apr 13 02:53:50 2015 UTC,"sophomore slump or not, Wennberg and Letestu play different roles"
BlueJackets,32e8ex,nunoveaux,2,Mon Apr 13 03:27:03 2015 UTC,"Only because Letestu's real benefit is being able to comfortably insert him higher in the lineup if needed.  The fear being if we suffer an injury up the middle and Wennberg can't fill in, we suddenly have the same problem we did this year, and now without a player like Letestu."
BlueJackets,32e8ex,stupidchange,3,Mon Apr 13 03:32:19 2015 UTC,"Well, assuming Letestu is let go, we still have Joey/Dubi/Arty/Wenny/Karlsson/Chaput and potentially Jenner/Foligno/Dano down the middle. I think we'll be okay."
BlueJackets,32e8ex,nunoveaux,2,Mon Apr 13 03:33:44 2015 UTC,"And we need forward room for guys like Rychel, Anderson or Bjorkstrand to get their shot. It sucks that Letestu could be an odd man out, but that's why Jarmo makes the big bucks. He has to make the decisions no one else wants to. Having Letestu is better than not having him, but we can't hold up any of the kids who are deserving of spots any longer.   And Karlsson impressed me. With Calvert and Rychel or Clarkson (I hate that much money on a 4th line) that could be an effective line."
BlueJackets,32e8ex,stupidchange,4,Mon Apr 13 15:06:29 2015 UTC,Rychel on the 4th line is a waste of a roster spot.  He needs to play higher.
BlueJackets,32e8ex,nunoveaux,2,Mon Apr 13 15:14:16 2015 UTC,"On a traditional ""4th line"" yes. But Karlsson/Calvert/Rychel would be a 4th line in name only.  HCTR likes to roll 4 lines that are hard to play against. That will be just as hard to play against as Hartsy/Wennberg/Dano  Lines would be 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b..."
BlueJackets,32e8ex,gazoogo,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:29:18 2015 UTC,This also assumes one or two of them are still here after this offseason.  It should be no secret that the plan to get better on D is to trade a forward.
BlueJackets,32e8ex,buckeye_baker,7,Mon Apr 13 15:13:08 2015 UTC,"Letestu is definitely one of my favorite players for the Jackets, so it would be very disappointing to see him go.   It's unfortunate that he took kind of a backseat role this year and saw a decrease in ice time and games played, but he was still a solid player, and definitely deserves a spot."
BlueJackets,32e8ex,SomeKindOfMonster,6,Mon Apr 13 04:16:37 2015 UTC,I hate to see guys let go who really believe in our organization and want to play in Columbus. Letestu has really been around since the lower points of the team too. I hope we can work it out with him.

BlueJackets,32e8ex,SomeKindOfMonster,4,Mon Apr 13 01:53:34 2015 UTC,Hmm.. if we're spending over 2.5/yr on him then it's definitely adios to Anisimov within the next year IMO

I know a lot of people like Johnson and think he would make a good captain, but I think the fact that he's not a very vocal guy (at least from what I've perceived from the outside) takes him out of consideration. Dubinsky and Foligno, on the other hand, are not only vocal, but are also good at rallying the team. I know that being able to rally a group of guys doesn't necessarily mean that they can lead them; but I think both are capable of doing the latter as well. Both go out and leave it all on the ice. When the games are finished, you know that 17 and 71 didn't hold anything back. When the team sees that in a captain, they'll follow the example set."

BlueJackets,32ci2t,jpsquill,2,Sun Apr 12 19:28:58 2015 UTC,"Here are some other possible picks for the first round based on other scouting sites:  ISS Hockey   1st: Connor McDavid 8th: Mathew Barzal 9th: Ivan Provorov   Future Considerations   1st: Connor McDavid 8th: Ivan Provorov 9th: Lawson Crouse   Craig Button   1st: Connor McDavid 8th: Brock Boeser 9th: Timo Meier   Button's rankings seem like he may be overvaluing both of those guys a little bit, at least compared to some other rankings, but Timo Meier is a pretty interesting prospect.  I'd love to get Provorov, but I have a feeling he'll be off the board before the Jackets have the chance to pick him.  Barzal would be pretty sweet to have, and if he's the best player available, they should definitely nab him, even if he is another center to add to the glut in our prospect pool.  I do not want them to draft Lawson Crouse, to be quite honest. It seems crazy to me that ISS has him ranked at 5. I just can't help but get this vibe about him that makes me feel like he'll be a slightly better, higher touted Jared Boll-type player. He's a big body but I can't help but feel hesitant about him. But who knows, I'll probably end up being wrong."
BlueJackets,32ci2t,Marcalogy,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:27:06 2015 UTC,"It's tough to judge this draft. Beside the top 2, there is very few consensus on who should go where. I know most of the time, you just go with the best player available, but this year, you can almost wait another round to get one player you really want.  If we get the first pick, it's a no-brainer, Connor McDavid is the next big thing. If we get the 8th or 9th selection, we can hope to grab either Zach Werenski or Ivan Provorov. I have a preference for Werenski, but Provorov is really good and I don't think there is that much of a difference between the two. Another possibility would be to pick Travis Konecny, who I believe is the third best prospect of this draft.  I've seen Timo Meier, Brock Boeser or Matt Barzal as potential picks. I would not be a fan, in all honesty. I've watched Halifax-Shawinigan's series and I don't think Meier is any better than Beauvillier or Yan. There's a tendency in the past few years to greatly overrate players from the Maritimes in the Q and Meier seem to be another case of this overrating. I'm not saying that any of these players are not good, but I think they should be late first round / early second round pick. As for Lawson Crouse, I'm not against it, he's definitely a top-10, but like I said, I'd rather pick Konecny.  In the later rounds, well... it's getting really tough to guess. For our 34th selection, we can throw a few names : Anthony Beauvillier, Ryan Gropp, Filip Ahl, Jacob Larsson. We could potentially grab Yevgeni Svechnikov (because he's Russian, essentially). I would be surprised, but we never know. As an avid QMJHL follower, I will argue that he is the League's best prospect for this draft. I also like that Mitchell Vande Sompel is being mentioned. Another potential guy would be Denis Malgin, who despite being small, is a hell of an offensive talent.  I'm not against picking Matthew Spencer with our 3rd selection, but I highly doubt he will still be available. The guy I would pick is Alexandre Carrier. For a reason I am still not entirely sure of why, he's being ridiculously underrated and at this point, he would be, without a doubt, the steal of the draft. (I believe he's amongst the 15 best prospects of this draft).  But yeah, I'm just throwing names in the air here."
BlueJackets,32amj3,cpenoh,9,Sun Apr 12 02:30:43 2015 UTC,I would really enjoy a sweep of the Pens by the Rangers. A shutout or 4 from Hank would just be icing on the cake.

I'm a Captain in the U.S. Army, was Infantry for five years and switched over to Military Intelligence.   I love music, and am a drummer. I am very passionate about Ohio State football.  I've played hockey since I was 5, back when CAHA was the only youth league and our options were the Fairgrounds rink or the Ohio State rink. I was so thankful when the Dublin Chiller was built. My dad was President of Hockey Future Ohio and was influential in bringing a franchise to Columbus. I remember skating with another kid from my team at the Nationwide Arena groundbreaking ceremony. They had a small temporary outdoor rink constructed at the site for media to get shots of us playing. My father initiated the Columbus Jr. Blue Jackets and organized the annual trips to compete in the Quebec Internation Peewee Tournament which I'm proud to say I competed in three years in a row. Most NHL players competed in this tournament. So, I guess you could say that I've been with the Blue Jackets since before day one. I love this franchise. I'm excited to see it gain so much support.  Thanks for being here with me, on Reddit, to share in this team. Being active duty military means I'm not going to be living in Columbus again for a long time, if ever, so the internet is my outlet.

Then health returned, and I once again saw the team I loved from last season.  Can you imagine a relatively healthy team for an entire season?  Tonight's team is the one that made Columbus think beyond college football.  And the one which excites an entire city into yelling CBJ along with the O-H-I-O.  This franchise is on its way."

BlueJackets,32aj1p,jpsquill,2,Sun Apr 12 02:17:03 2015 UTC,I'm happy with Barzal or Rantanen if we can't get Provorov/Werenski tho

BlueJackets,32aj1p,GeekYogurt,2,Sun Apr 12 02:21:35 2015 UTC,"If they're dead set on taking a D in the first round but Hanifin/Werenski/Provorov are off the board at 8 or 9 then they should trade down and take Zboril or something. Or pray they get a nice D prospect with a 2nd rounder like Kylington or Juulsen or someone like that. Still, I'm a strong supporter of BPA over need."
BlueJackets,32aj1p,humpcatting,2,Sun Apr 12 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm a fan of BPA, especially if neither Provorov or Werenski are around when they pick. At that point they definitely have to go for whichever forward is best, and pick up D later on if they so choose."

BlueJackets,32aj1p,foggell44,2,Sun Apr 12 02:24:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I'm specifically thinking about the last 5 games or so when he decided to healthy scratch Boll again, and how that fourth line ended up playing very, very well. I honestly thought he would have put Boll in last night for the home closer fan appreciation night, but he still rolled that fourth line, thankfully."
BlueJackets,32aj1p,HermanBonJovi,2,Sun Apr 12 02:30:15 2015 UTC,True. Let's just hope he doesn't get any bollogna ideas over the offseason.
BlueJackets,32aj1p,infiniteshadow,3,Sun Apr 12 02:40:21 2015 UTC,Remember when I benched Dano for Boll?
BlueJackets,32aj1p,laxpulse,2,Sun Apr 12 03:18:57 2015 UTC,And then Boll got scratched for the last 5 games
BlueJackets,32aj1p,Zherdev,3,Sun Apr 12 02:30:10 2015 UTC,Maybe that Dano getting benched game was Boll's sending off party and we'll never see him again

Thanks again to Bop, for winning cutest commercial award, single handedly winning more games than I can count. Thank you to the Chaperoned line, my girlfriend can't pick a favorite player between Wennberg and Dano. Thank you to Hartsy, again I bet Philly didn't expect this 60 points to Umberger's 15. Thanks to Johanson for the controller disconnect move. Thanks to Dubi for getting star players to fight, and for getting all of us to buy diamonds.

Dubi, Johnson, and Hartnell gettings As.  Drop Boll and use Prout as the primary fighter. I feel Prout is the weakest of our Dmen but if he could absorb Jared's roll I'd be ecstatic to keep him on. Keep Calvert, Morin, Letetsu, Goloubef, and Connauton.  I'd personally get rid of  Skille, Tropp, Borque, and Falk.  I love the hell outta Artie but trading him might make the most sense. Package him with Calvy (;_;) I believe we'd get a good return for him Reevaluate the conditioning coaches Draft D and Winger   EDIT: Getting clarified on C/A raito."

BlueJackets,32as32,flyerfanatic93,2,Sun Apr 12 15:55:32 2015 UTC,Oh I don't think I will. I'm just waiting until your flair on /r/hockey turns into CBJ flair. The day will come. It is inevitable. Just embrace the fact that CBJ will one day be your number one team. It's gonna happen.
BlueJackets,32as32,gazoogo,2,Sun Apr 12 16:22:49 2015 UTC,Very much contemplating flair switching to the cannon permanently right now. /r/hockey has fucking ridiculous flair based down voting and since the Kings and Bruins are out and the Penguins are being ignored all the hate is on the Hawks right now.

BlueJackets,32aukp,jpsquill,6,Sun Apr 12 03:49:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for running this throughout the season. It probably took up a decent amount of your free time, and there had to be days when you didn't feel like checking/updating, but you didn't let that get in the way. The GWG challenge was one of my favorite things throughout the year, and it's a great way to keep people active in the sub. Kudos to you, and I'm glad you plan on doing it next season. It really gives this sub some character. Thanks again!"
BlueJackets,32aukp,AKlep,3,Sun Apr 12 03:55:22 2015 UTC,"It was my pleasure! I'm glad that people played it regularly, and enjoyed it! Even towards the end of the season there were more newcomers that jumped in which was great. The biggest thing I had a problem with was coming up with bonus questions because they ended up getting so redundant by like the 30th game haha. Hopefully next season goes even better!"
BlueJackets,32aukp,AKlep,3,Sun Apr 12 04:01:21 2015 UTC,"When in doubt, how many saves will Bob have"

This has been fun to look forward to all season, and even in those rough months when our team was injured it gave me a reason to keep watching games and not curl up and cry in the fetal position.  As mentioned in another thread, it was especially fun competing against my husband, /u/infiniteshadow, who gave me a run for my money all season. Next season, dear.  As always, Go Jackets!"

I find it shitty that we have a legitimate team once we've been healthy these past couple weeks, we're still at the bottom of the rankings and likely to not get a 'great' draft pick.

BlueJackets,324qwh,TheDoubleL27,7,Fri Apr 10 17:52:22 2015 UTC,"Goalie Sergei Bobrovsky had never suffered a long-term injury before he arrived in Columbus, but he has been idled three times in the past two seasons, twice because of groin injuries. ‚ÄúI will change what I do this summer,‚Äù Bobrovsky said.   This is huge in my opinion. Groin injuries for goalies are one of the most preventable injuries with a proper stretching/strength routine. Hopefully he and Ian Clark figure out something that works better.  Likewise, a general review of the strength/conditioning routines by a third party would be extremely helpful. Stress fractures from off-ice workouts and soft-tissue injuries have to be addressed properly."

BlueJackets,324oxe,WannabeFinn,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:29:35 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that we couldn't send him down. Is he on a 2 way?
BlueJackets,324oxe,HORSEtheGAME,6,Fri Apr 10 17:50:27 2015 UTC,"2 way doesn't effect the ability to be sent down, 2 way contracts mean that you're paid a different salary based on what league you're in.

That way we can call it a conditioning stint so he can work on his speed and we will call him up when we need him, which will be never.  We've seen it a lot with players that are just past their prime and not performing much: Mike Richards, Dany Heatley, etc"
BlueJackets,324oxe,SomeKindOfMonster,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:59:13 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that will be the case. But if it is, does it bother you in any way think that if his NHL career has come to and end that they wouldn't let him play one last home game in front of the fans that have supported him for so long? I mean, this game is about as meaningless as they come, as far as the standings are concerned, and most expect Buffalo to take it laying down in a continued effort to tank. This would be the perfect chance for him to have one last hurrah if his time here is done."

BlueJackets,3211r0,Zherdev,19,Thu Apr 9 18:47:04 2015 UTC,I desperately want the Sens to make it instead of the Pens. I would be so happy
BlueJackets,3211r0,flyerfanatic93,12,Thu Apr 9 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. If the Sens kick out the Pens,  I will root for them all the way to the end of this postseason."
BlueJackets,3211r0,xam2y,9,Thu Apr 9 19:59:36 2015 UTC,Caps for Ovie's cup.  Sens for fellow BGSU Falcon Hamburglar.
BlueJackets,3211r0,GeekYogurt,2,Thu Apr 9 22:07:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, I like the caps this season for whatever reason. In the west I gotta go hawks....even though they've already won before, it's the only city I've lived in other than CBUS with an NHL team."

In the west I'm going with the Wild just because I lived in the Twins for a couple years and really loved it up there.  But if a team manages to kick the Pens out of the playoffs, they have my utmost respect."
BlueJackets,3211r0,XdefeatsY,2,Thu Apr 9 23:46:04 2015 UTC,"Blues, Ottawa, Rangers. I was originally a Blues fan when I lived in Arkansas so I would love to see them get a cup. Ottawa because I have always had a soft spot for that team, I think because I really like their thirds. Rangers because Hank and Nash deserve it at this point."
BlueJackets,3211r0,Logosmonkey,3,Fri Apr 10 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"In the east,  the Rangers, I think.  I would also like to see Nash hoist the Cup.   In the west, the Wild.    Don't hate me.  :-)"

You guys are about to tear up the league, and I'd love to see a Stars/Jackets Finals in a few years. BOBROVSKY!!!"

BlueJackets,31zrxz,flyerfanatic93,2,Thu Apr 9 14:36:51 2015 UTC,Reminds me so much of the Winnipeg Jets regular home/aways. The color scheme is a little different from Columbus' actual third jerseys.
BlueJackets,31zrxz,andrewdt10,3,Thu Apr 9 15:02:08 2015 UTC,I think we can change that middle blue stripe to a red stripe. We be good.   I get a big Jets vibe too
BlueJackets,31zrxz,AtTheRink,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"For me, those designs just scream ""Jets vibe."" It's almost identical. I'd agree on the red strip and maybe a few other subtle changes to get away from the Jets' look."
BlueJackets,31zrxz,andrewdt10,2,Thu Apr 9 18:15:20 2015 UTC,Bring back the red stripes with the white stars from the original jerseys along the waist. And then bring back he silver stars on the sleeves like our original third and remove the stripss
BlueJackets,31zrxz,AtTheRink,7,Thu Apr 9 18:44:42 2015 UTC,I should have just waited until the others found the real thing. But here is my pitiful attempt of a cream colored jersey.  http://imgur.com/Rp9SHxZ  Edit: I did try... way too hard... thanks!

I missed the game, but i notice that EVERY line produced tonight, how awesome is that! It really identifies how much of a Boll ball and chain Boll is on our 4th line, he's been sat for two games in a row and in both games our 4th gets a goal."

BlueJackets,320wuz,Milalwi,3,Thu Apr 9 18:11:31 2015 UTC,"For what it is worth, here is what my ticket rep told me about the PSL a year ago. I purchased a 1/2 season package, so he didn't go into a lot of detail.  The PSL is only in our Full Season ticket package and the pricing of the PSL is worked into the pricing of the Full Season so it is not an additional purchase when buying a Full Season. The Half season ticket package does not have a PSL attached to it.  Only 2 NHL teams use PSLs. The Maple Leafs (hockey's most valuable franchise), and CBJ. IMO, it's bullshit. If you plan to purchase full season tickets, though - people do sell them on craigslist from time to time, ie. when they move out of town and it no longer makes sense to buy full season tickets to keep it."

BlueJackets,320wuz,burnie08,0,Sat Apr 11 03:33:20 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if they are a separate thing. I think a PSL is just a fancy way of saying season ticket.

Note that this is in addition to the cost of one full season's worth of tickets.  But the PSL is a one-time cost that entitles you to that seat for future seasons until you give it up or stop buying tickets.  So let's say that you want to buy tickets to a seat for a full season and it's going to cost you $2995, then getting the PSL will cost you $2995 on top of that, and you'll be guaranteed that exact seat for as long as you buy tickets.  OTOH, there may be options at other times to just buy a full season of tickets without a PSL.  Assuming that you bought a seat that was available for the full season this coming season, there is no guarantee that you would be able to get that same seat for subsequent seasons unless you bought a PSL."
BlueJackets,3207bs,SomeKindOfMonster,3,Thu Apr 9 15:09:39 2015 UTC,"For those that don't know, Moses played for Jarmo's former team, Jokerit, in the KHL and was the leading scorer in the league this year. He planned to go to the NHL after this season and the talk was that he may sign with Jarmo again."
BlueJackets,3207bs,jpsquill,2,Thu Apr 9 15:10:44 2015 UTC,"Bill Zito, the Assistant GM, also used to be Moses' agent. It's kind of unfortunate to see him sign elsewhere, but I feel like it could have just ended up as another Simon Hjalmarsson type of deal where he wouldn't be able to find the ice time he wanted with the depth we've got going."

BlueJackets,31y0c5,nunoveaux,8,Thu Apr 9 01:10:01 2015 UTC,Portzline's feed has details about the CBJ not having any info from Reilly's camp on the matter.  Also indicating it doesn't sound he will sign with Columbus.
BlueJackets,31y0c5,flyerfanatic93,2,Thu Apr 9 01:11:08 2015 UTC,Then why the hell did we draft him?
BlueJackets,31y0c5,jpsquill,3,Thu Apr 9 06:02:07 2015 UTC,Because no one probably had any idea this would happen?
BlueJackets,31y0c5,flyerfanatic93,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:49:29 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand why we would draft a player who, almost no matter what, doesn't have to play for us. I thought the whole point of drafting a player was so that you own their rights and they can't play for another team unless the drafting team traded that player."
BlueJackets,31y0c5,jpsquill,2,Thu Apr 9 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"When you're drafted, you have four years to sign with the team that drafted you, otherwise you become a UFA. This isn't like some sort of exclusive thing just for Mike Reilly. This isn't the first time this has happened, and it won't be the last.  When Reilly was drafted, he played that first year in the BCHL, which ate up his first year of owning his draft rights. Then of course he went to play for Minnesota his freshman and sophomore years. I don't think people necessarily expected him to return for his junior year of college, and the Blue Jackets tried to sign him to a professional contract last offseason if I recall, which he obviously didn't do, putting him into his final year of the team owning his rights.    Pretty much, it's a loophole for college players, if you want to think of it that way. But to question drafting him in the first place doesn't make a whole lot of sense because you would have needed to have a crystal ball to see that he would end up developing into a player that should have been drafted higher than the fourth round and would stay through three years of college.   I understand it's confusing, because typically players that are drafted out of juniors run out of eligibility before their rights expire or sign before then anyway, or prospects that go to college are either high enough profile guys that they'll forego two, or even three years of college eligibility to sign, or when they're drafted in the first place, their plan is to go straight into the NCAA, which wasn't the case for Reilly. Maybe if he would have been going straight to Minnesota after he was drafted, things would have been a little different. Would that have changed the outcome of things? Maybe, maybe not.  I mean, it sucks, sure, but there's really not a whole lot that can be done at this point in time except hope he has a change of heart or comes to his senses and sees how well off this team is and how bright the future is."
BlueJackets,31y0c5,flyerfanatic93,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:21:27 2015 UTC,I appreciate your detailed response. I'm still kind of new to hockey and this thing just kind of baffles my mind. Is the reason that this doesn't happen more often because most of these players aren't good enough to bring multiple teams to the table? I think I'm just confusing myself haha
BlueJackets,31y0c5,jpsquill,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:46:46 2015 UTC,"I think that may have a lot to do with this particular case. He was drafted in the fourth round, but he's certainly looked better than that these past two seasons. He pretty much knows by now he can go where he chooses, and pick the best spot for him, which is pretty ironic considering he could have been finishing out the regular season in a Columbus sweater, and almost certainly guaranteed himself a spot in our top 6, if not top 4 for next season."

BlueJackets,31y0c5,jpsquill,6,Thu Apr 9 14:31:06 2015 UTC,Not really any surprise here. It's a damn shame he's most likely not going to sign here.
BlueJackets,31y0c5,nykc,4,Thu Apr 9 01:13:46 2015 UTC,"Plenty of talent out there, would rather him not sign with us if he doesn't want to be a part of this. His loss, this team is going places!"

BlueJackets,31xfz4,THECapedCaper,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:48:58 2015 UTC,"Stats withheld....he grew on me, McElhinney was there when we really needed him to be good when Bob was injured.   I learned how to spell his name, okay. Not just Mcbackup."
BlueJackets,31xfz4,HerNameWas_Lola,-2,Thu Apr 9 03:42:09 2015 UTC,"Lets just torpedo this streaming shitpile of stupid from the word go: You're comparing McElhinney's numbers to the league average for starters and backups. Comparing him against starters is pointless because he's not a starter. If you compare him against the league average backup goalie he comes in far more favorably.  Also, you have to recall that his play back in November happened when he came back early from a concussion (due to Bob's injury) His numbers were horrible there, but much better otherwise."
BlueJackets,31xfz4,notwhoithink,2,Thu Apr 9 01:42:33 2015 UTC,"A quick look at stats.hockeyanalysis.com, let's set this criteria: less time than McElhinney but more than 1000 minutes played over the past two years. That's 20-60-ish games. There are 15 goalies over with a better EVSV% than him (and of those, 8 are above the league average .922). If we lower the bottom limit to 500 minutes (dropping to 13-ish games at worst), that number jumps to 27 (16 of which are above the .922 average). Yes, there's risk in those low-game guys.  The point is that it's very easy to replace him with someone who projects as better than the current backup (not all of these guys are to be kept, there are some backups with bigger loads than McElhinney) and not too hard to shoot higher to the .922 level. Why would you want the Jackets to stick with something we know won't be great, especially when there are so many guys that have a chance to be better?"

BlueJackets,31p74k,Tappedout0324,6,Tue Apr 7 02:01:43 2015 UTC,Because we had 11 players on the IR for a decent bit of the season.

BlueJackets,31p74k,notwhoithink,9,Tue Apr 7 10:38:50 2015 UTC,Now.. I would have loved to see a 7 game series of this in the conference finals. One of the best games I've seen in a while.
BlueJackets,31p74k,Noler61,17,Tue Apr 7 02:16:51 2015 UTC,Fourth line looked a little slow tonight. Thinking we should bring in Tropp and Boller next game to give us some speed.

BlueJackets,31p74k,cbjfan51,2,Wed Apr 8 02:00:26 2015 UTC,"No goddammit! The first line looked slow. Johansen just pussyfooting around all night. He needs a fire lit under his ass. Play a little more aggressive, etc."
BlueJackets,31p74k,goaligno,7,Tue Apr 7 01:54:50 2015 UTC,Fuck.
BlueJackets,31p74k,jpsquill,5,Tue Apr 7 01:47:02 2015 UTC,That... that hurt
BlueJackets,31p74k,Back41DayOnly,3,Tue Apr 7 01:47:19 2015 UTC,We definitely deserved to win that one. Too bad.
BlueJackets,31p74k,topcopontheforce,3,Tue Apr 7 01:56:52 2015 UTC,"Two bad turnovers ended up killing us but we fought tooth and nail to the end, and imo that's what ends up mattering in the long run. Anything could have ended that. Twenty more seconds and a good block and we would have got it in regulation, Arty's shot not going up into space in OT, etc. To me that was a playoff game in spirit if not in practicality."
BlueJackets,31p74k,Darclite,3,Tue Apr 7 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"With the Pens on the downturn, Flyers being shaky, Devils primed to tank, and Carolina being bad, I look forward to you guys being one of the dominant teams in the division in the coming years when you're healthy. Y'all are fun to watch. And Anisimov is adorable."
BlueJackets,31p74k,ScarletWitch65,4,Tue Apr 7 05:21:53 2015 UTC,"Don't hear Anisimov called adorable all too often haha. That gif of Bob hugging him is the cutest thing ever. Then again, who on this team isn't adorable?"
BlueJackets,31p74k,Darclite,2,Tue Apr 7 06:17:53 2015 UTC,"There was an interview after he did the ""snipe"" against Tampa Bay when he was with us where he said something like ""I didn't mean to make everyone mad...guy in Russia does that, everyone go crazy, very sorry."" I loved his interviews, he made everything sound interesting. Fun to watch him play too."
BlueJackets,31p74k,ScarletWitch65,2,Tue Apr 7 06:22:11 2015 UTC,"Ahh I'm sorry I missed that! He's been amazing to watch play lately, so awesome"

The Rangers aren't the worst of the worst, but some of their fans online were asshats around the whole multiple trade thing and I'm just not big enough to forgive them.  I really can't decide who I'd like to see miss the playoffs more. Pittsburgh or Detroit. I'm just full of hate."

BlueJackets,31p74k,THECapedCaper,10,Tue Apr 7 01:52:07 2015 UTC,I can root for the Rangers if it means they get to clobber the Pens.
BlueJackets,31p74k,cpenoh,2,Tue Apr 7 02:10:37 2015 UTC,"Hold on hope. The Pens haven't clinched, yet."
BlueJackets,31p74k,yankeesfan13,4,Tue Apr 7 22:04:28 2015 UTC,"There is no reason we should have lost that.  There is no reason we should have allowed that many shots (41 I think?).  There is no reason that we should have left Bob all alone that many times.  On a more positive note, can I mention how much I love Calvert?  He's one of the least skilled guys on the team (only the 4th line and a few of the D are worse than him skill wise) yet he puts in so much effort that he makes a huge difference.  If the entire team played with as much heart as him, we'd be looking at a playoff spot right now."
BlueJackets,31p74k,pinupstephaniemarie,6,Tue Apr 7 01:53:18 2015 UTC,"I was pretty disappointed in Savard, the goal that tied the game with less than 30 seconds left, he should have had that block."
BlueJackets,31p74k,AtTheRink,2,Tue Apr 7 01:56:02 2015 UTC,Not really Savard's fault. He was where he should've been.
BlueJackets,31p74k,Buckeye931,2,Tue Apr 7 02:04:13 2015 UTC,"Letestu was off in no-man's land on that goal, and like you said, Savard did have his man covered. Letestu was just standing in the middle of the slot, when a player above him was already covering the slot."
BlueJackets,31p74k,AtTheRink,1 point,Tue Apr 7 07:39:08 2015 UTC,"JJ should've never went to St. Louis on the boards. He anticipated the pass down the wall and left Savard out to dry. And yeah, Letestu didn't really do anything to help the situation"
BlueJackets,31p74k,notwhoithink,-1,Tue Apr 7 11:37:35 2015 UTC,It was a pretty mad scramble at the end.  People were getting out of position and just trying to hang on another 30 seconds.  Sometimes when your opponent is rattled like that it is the easiest time to score.
BlueJackets,31p74k,goaligno,5,Tue Apr 7 10:41:10 2015 UTC,Calvert is in beast mode. Good for him.
BlueJackets,31p74k,knukklez,-1,Tue Apr 7 01:59:12 2015 UTC,"I blame Calvert for not covering his man on Rangers goal 2. I was really sour on him the rest of the game. It may have put him in a negative light for me tonight, but I felt like he was terrible and didn't finish opportunities that were presented to him on a fucking platter."
BlueJackets,31p74k,HermanBonJovi,2,Tue Apr 7 02:08:03 2015 UTC,"Bummed, but not upset. That was a hell of a game, particularly from a goaltending stand point. So much fun to watch. Both teams were deserving of the win, unfortunately, someone had to lose."

The guys looked great, and it was awesome to see a team like the Rangers get a fire lit under their ass there in the 3rd period. How about that Dano? I cannot believe he was a healthy scratch the other night."
BlueJackets,31p74k,Buckfisher,4,Tue Apr 7 13:50:58 2015 UTC,"So. Fucking. Close.  But, in good news - we were right fucking there with another elite team. We have a bright future on this team. Really proud of the way we are closing this season out."

BlueJackets,31p74k,notwhoithink,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:52:17 2015 UTC,It's sound like we played really well. I o ly caught the last 10 minutes plus OT. Why did we let through so many shots tonight?
BlueJackets,31p74k,knukklez,0,Tue Apr 7 03:36:13 2015 UTC,"Why did we let through so many shots tonight?    The numbers look worse than the game actually was.  Through the first two periods we were ahead on shots, 24-21.  By the end of the third period  it was 30-36 in favor of the Rangers, owing in large part to a strong push by the Rangers in the final few minutes. Dubi scored the go-ahead goal with about 8 minutes to go, and then Prout got his penalty for delay of game with 5 to go.  They also pulled Lundquist at the end, so for about 3 1/2 minutes out of the final 5 minutes the Rangers had a man advantage.  With a team like the Rangers that's going to mean a lot of shots."
BlueJackets,31p74k,justthetip751,0,Tue Apr 7 10:49:10 2015 UTC,I fuckin' called it. I explained exactly how that game was going to end to my wife about 5 minutes before it happened.

""...and collected his first career hat trick in a 5-3 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins April 4"" ""He leads the club in goals, points, plus/minus rating and power-play goals (11) and has set single-season career highs in goals, assists and points."""
BlueJackets,31n55t,SomeKindOfMonster,3,Mon Apr 6 16:35:49 2015 UTC,He's having just an incredible season. He's got a career-best 70 points right now. His second highest total? 47 points when he was with the Sens in 2011-2012.
BlueJackets,31n55t,overcatastrophe,5,Mon Apr 6 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"He should get the ""C"" tattooed on his chest when HCTR finally gives it to him"
BlueJackets,31n55t,HeadCoachToddRichard,8,Mon Apr 6 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"Don't be so sure. He's a hard worker, but have you seen Boll's play lately? I need my captain to be a role model. We've got a lot of young guys on this team. I need them to  look up to someone with grit and determination. Someone who's willing to sacrifice everything for the good of the team. Foligno had a few goals the other night--that's great and all--but Boll is the embodiment of everything the Blue Jackets stand for. So don't be surprised if you see him with a new letter on his jersey next season."

Here's the deal: Murray is good. He's also young. That means he can get even better with experience. There's only one way to get that experience, and that is to play games. He has already missed so many games in the past couple of seasons that he needs every game he can get. He's less than a week from getting a couple of months of anyway, why not play him if he's truly healthy? That should be the standard here, is he ""truly healthy"" or is he just ""healthy enough to play""? If it's the former then he needs to be on the ice, but there's nobody posting in this thread (or in that blog) who knows the true answer. That's between him and the team doctors."

Nothing too hard hitting but more of a discussion on how Murray has been handled by the team thus far."
BlueJackets,31o7ok,AtTheRink,2,Tue Apr 7 16:37:44 2015 UTC,"I think you let him play.  Let him get games in and get experience, especially when the games mean absolutely nothing.  Best time for him, since there is nothing to play for.  The more games the better.    I think him not playing would be a huge shot to the ego and morale.  ""Hey Ryan, you're healthy and good to go, but we don't have faith in you to not get hurt in three games, so you're done for the year.""  I think it would show a lack of faith from the organization to 27 if they made him shut it down."
BlueJackets,31o7ok,jpsquill,2,Wed Apr 8 19:01:14 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this. I think he should play, but maybe not necessarily play 25+ minutes, not that he would anyway. People keep saying let him get to 100%, but it's like they haven't thought that maybe he is at 100% already. They seem to want him to get to an unrealistic 200% or something."

BlueJackets,31o7ok,kowdijj,0,Tue Apr 7 16:48:40 2015 UTC,I think Murray should see some AHL ice sometime. I think it'd be good for him to get up to speed with his timing and conditioning. But there's not much time left there either.
BlueJackets,31o7ok,notwhoithink,0,Tue Apr 7 14:07:28 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be good for him to get up to speed with his timing and conditioning.   There's no point.  He's not an AHL player or a ""tweener""-type player, he's an NHL player.  Getting his speed and timing up to AHL spec won't help him in the NHL, and a rehab stint isn't going to help him with the NHL season ending in a few days anyway.  Not to mention, while I'd be OK with him playing a couple of NHL games here at the end, I wouldn't be OK with him at all risking injury over a couple of AHL games.  He'd be much better off just practicing with the CBJ."

All of the players you mentioned are great choices, but they've all played for other teams at some point. Not that that is a deal breaker or anything, but Joey has a chance to be a Blue Jacket for his entire career. I believe the only other notable player with this feat is David Vyborny."
BlueJackets,31p23t,AKlep,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:03:20 2015 UTC,That is true and I considered Joey but do you think he will stick around for the long haul

BlueJackets,31n61b,coachkrumm,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:15:01 2015 UTC,Here's the one I was thinking for me
BlueJackets,31ll8y,kowdijj,4,Mon Apr 6 05:27:41 2015 UTC,"Foligno didn't need 17 minutes to score 3 goals, only needed 16"
BlueJackets,31ll8y,xam2y,4,Mon Apr 6 12:51:37 2015 UTC,Interesting to see. It's kinda nice not having a single player in the game that I don't want on the ice.
BlueJackets,31ll8y,ScarletWitch65,2,Mon Apr 6 08:05:02 2015 UTC,We might have seen Boll's last game as a Blue Jacket against the Islanders.
BlueJackets,31ll8y,xam2y,7,Mon Apr 6 12:52:40 2015 UTC,"I truly hope you're right, but the fact they scratched Dano in favour of him for that game scares me."
BlueJackets,31ll8y,imbored343,2,Mon Apr 6 13:08:35 2015 UTC,"Other than that being the right call, what makes you think this?"
BlueJackets,31ll8y,GeekYogurt,2,Mon Apr 6 14:44:48 2015 UTC,"I think the obvious move in the offseason is to #BuyOutBoll, free up his roster spot, and let one of our promising young forwards have it instead."
BlueJackets,31ll8y,SomeKindOfMonster,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:01:04 2015 UTC,wouldn't we be better off exposing Boll to waivers and burying him in the AHL? we'd save ~900k (?) that way and he'd be off the books in 2 years rather than 4
BlueJackets,31ll8y,WannabeFinn,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"Would it be better? I don't think his contract is two-way, and I can't see anyone picking him up off waivers. Not sure what the details are of a contract post-clearing of waivers."
BlueJackets,31ll8y,SomeKindOfMonster,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:30:47 2015 UTC,"So Boll's cap hit is 1.7m, right? If we send him through waivers, he isn't claimed and goes to Springy, we end up with 925k of cap relief. That means we have 775k cap hit remaining on the CBJ but we have a freed up roster spot and only 2 years of the 775k cap hit. Buying out his contract would mean 4 years of a likely larger cap hit plaguing the CBJ."
BlueJackets,31ll8y,WannabeFinn,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:56:21 2015 UTC,"I'm just curious, where does the 4 years come from since Boll has two years left on his contract? Would that be a penalty imposed by the NHL because of the buyout?"
BlueJackets,31ll8y,infiniteshadow,2,Mon Apr 6 17:20:59 2015 UTC,When you buy out a contract it's paid out over double the years remaining.
BlueJackets,31ll8y,WannabeFinn,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:55:43 2015 UTC,I remember reading something a while ago that said Boll's contract wouldn't allow him to go to Springfield. Is that not the case?
BlueJackets,31ll8y,ScarletWitch65,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:10:20 2015 UTC,i believe the article was probably just saying that he would have to be exposed to waivers to be sent down. There is no way boll got a no-movement clause in his contract :)
BlueJackets,31ll8y,randomhero19,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:56:18 2015 UTC,Why buy out boll? We should save the buy out for clarkson if he doesn't turn out the way we want; I'd rather buy out Clarksons contract in a year or 2 at $4mill+ than Bolls relatively small $1.5+mill
BlueJackets,31ll8y,brules_rules93,1 point,Sat Apr 11 05:05:02 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the exact details off the top of my head, but I think the way Clarkson's contract is constructed, it's pretty much buy out proof.  Edit: Details about buying out his contract from this article published last March:   And if you‚Äôre a Leafs fan, you best sit down as we go through the buyout scenario. As we established, Clarkson‚Äôs contract is on the books for six more seasons at $5.25 million per. If the Leafs were to buy him out, the buyout period would last for double what‚Äôs left on the contract, which would take them to 2025-26. According to capgeek.com, they buyout cap hit would be structured the following way:   $2.3 million in 2014-15 $1.54 million in 2015-16 $42,000 in ‚Äô16-17 and ‚Äô17-18 $2.3 million in ‚Äô18-19 $3.7 million in ‚Äô19-20 $1.8 million from ‚Äô19-20 through ‚Äô25-26   And it would be an enormous amount in real dollars as well. Clarkson or his agent must have seen the buyout possibility coming because in every remaining season, the vast majority of his salary is paid in signing bonus. When a player is bought out, two-thirds of his salary is paid, but 100 percent of his signing bonus is paid. Of the $31.5 million Clarkson is owed over the next six seasons, $24.25 of it is to be paid in signing bonus money. That leaves just $7.25 million that is subject to a buyout, which means it would cost the Leafs a grand total of $29.1 million, plus 12 years or varying cap hits on the books, to buy Clarkson out.   There would be absolutely no way this organization could be able to handle that scenario."
BlueJackets,31ll8y,jpsquill,5,Sat Apr 11 05:16:28 2015 UTC,"More interesting to me: Other than Atkinson (11:53) and Wennberg (17:15), every forward had between 12 and 16 minutes. That is literally just rolling 4 lines."
BlueJackets,31ll8y,ranatalus,3,Mon Apr 6 15:21:00 2015 UTC,I like the idea of rolling 4 lines. It would allow our top lines to be better rested against other top lines.
BlueJackets,31ll8y,AKlep,3,Mon Apr 6 15:30:42 2015 UTC,I do too; it means every line is trusted to be sound defensively and productive offensively.
BlueJackets,31ll8y,ranatalus,2,Mon Apr 6 15:49:23 2015 UTC,"Which is something a lot of teams don't have, hence the advantage. Hopefully Jarmo sees this and makes roster changes accordingly."
BlueJackets,31ll8y,AKlep,4,Mon Apr 6 16:01:25 2015 UTC,"Wennberg's inflated TOI is likely due to the fact that he spends significant time on both the PP, PK and at EV. I also think the team is testing his ability to handle such minutes, because Anisimov will probably be part of a package deal to land a top 4 defenseman this summer."
BlueJackets,31ll8y,Buckeye931,4,Tue Apr 7 06:50:32 2015 UTC,Likely due to extremely balanced lines. He's definitely not our best forward.
BlueJackets,31ll8y,WannabeFinn,5,Mon Apr 6 05:37:56 2015 UTC,"Given Wenny's skill set, it's a very good thing he can eat minutes and not be a liability."
BlueJackets,31ll8y,nunoveaux,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:06:49 2015 UTC,"I agree he's not out best forward. But HCTR is utilizing him. All the statisticians would see that TOI and say otherwise, right? Isn't that how quality of competition is determined?"

BlueJackets,31ir2q,notwhoithink,-6,Sun Apr 5 20:43:39 2015 UTC,"Anyone remember when Umby was the soul of the team?  Don't get me wrong, I've been very high on Foligno for a few seasons now. I'm very glad to see the rest of the fans take notice, now that he has had so much success. But I kinda get sick of the fan base chanting""give him the C"" when a player is doing well. They just keep rotating through names based on who is having the got week.  Leaders are not ordained by management. The natural leader will rise to the top on his own, and when the rest of the team has decided to follow him then he will be the leader regardless of what letter is on his jersey. Maybe management chooses to make it official, maybe not. But until one man clearly stands above the rest, I'm good with the current committee approach."
BlueJackets,31ir2q,Pyzorz,9,Sun Apr 5 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say people ""chant 'give him the C'"" when a certain player is doing well. Actually, not at all. Dubi was the name tossed around last season but he had no better of a season than he usually has. Maybe you could say his performance during the playoffs got more people on his bandwagon, but people wanted him to have the C even during the regular season.   Edit: Boone was the other name tossed around a lot this year and he didn't even play most of the season."

Yeah, Porty seems convinced that Boone is the guy and has been saying so for a couple of seasons.  I think that a lot of readers pick up on that and run with it without thinking it through.  The way I see it, we have had at least three strong candidates for the C for awhile now:  Dubi, Foligno, and Johnson.  If none of them have somehow managed to cement the role then it's going to be quite some time before someone does."

BlueJackets,31gcgv,Back41DayOnly,3,Sun Apr 5 00:47:40 2015 UTC,Players seem to be less cautious with running goalies when its a really damn good goalie where they need to crash the net to score. Just ask Carey Price
BlueJackets,31gcgv,TheDoubleL27,3,Sat Apr 4 20:45:38 2015 UTC,"I can accept that fact, I just don't like it. Either way, it's the ref's job to protect the guys out there on the ice and that includes the goaltender. If they got a handle on that, maybe JJ wouldn't have had to sock that one Penguin's player in the face."
BlueJackets,31gcgv,Buckfisher,3,Sat Apr 4 20:46:52 2015 UTC,Trust me I agree with you. I play goalie and its pretty obvious when I'm having a strong game how players will crash/run you. They do need to protect Bob better.

BlueJackets,31c08i,esormaj,5,Fri Apr 3 18:51:22 2015 UTC,It was the summer prospect dinner for season ticket holders. He ate with me and my friends I sit by. There was also a kid at the table and he signed an autograph for him and made his day. I am a huge Notre Dame fan so we talked about that a whole lot. He talked about living in Springfield and how he was looking forward to a whole season in the pros. He told me a lot about playing in the outdoor games. He was just a nice guy and easy to talk to. Very appreciative of being here. Smart kid with a good head on his shoulders.
BlueJackets,31c08i,esormaj,2,Fri Apr 3 20:05:40 2015 UTC,Can you explain more about your experience? Would love to hear about it.
BlueJackets,31c08i,SomeKindOfMonster,2,Fri Apr 3 19:07:08 2015 UTC,"TJ Tynan is probably my favorite prospect that wasn't drafted in the last two years. I really would love for him to stick around with the organization, even if he ends up mainly playing in the AHL."
BlueJackets,31c08i,jpsquill,2,Fri Apr 3 18:28:55 2015 UTC,He might be a future player like Derek Mackenzie which could be very nice for our 4th line

BlueJackets,319jpy,Devman90,3,Fri Apr 3 12:20:35 2015 UTC,"Eh, sorry but I still think Foligno is the best choice for captain. He represented the team as a captain at the ASG, he's shown chemistry with the whole team especially Bob and RyJo, when people think CBJ Foligno pops in their head before Dubinsky, and Dub likes picking fights with guys like Toews and Crosby and I don't want that shit elevated to the example set by the captain for the team to follow."
BlueJackets,319jpy,Aperture-Employee,5,Fri Apr 3 14:33:36 2015 UTC,Agreed. Foligno should get the C.

I was rooting for the Devils, this year I won tickets to a game early in October. Boll got into two fights I believe, after hearing the crowd roar and experiencing NWA - I immediately became a committed die hard hockey fan, and why not root for my hometown team.   Long story short, I became a flex plan ticket holder, ended up at over 22 games this year and am sad as a baby who is too old to breast feed now that the season is almost over. I upped my plan to the Qtr season and plan on attending most if not all the home games next year.   Moral of the story is, if you sir live in Columbus and root for NY still after going to a few games here - you are beyond help!!! But hey glad you had fun and please do come back."

But good god, boll for dano. What a god damn travesty. Either way. Good game."
BlueJackets,319gt1,goaligno,5,Fri Apr 3 02:10:07 2015 UTC,I honestly think they need to get rid of the extra point for OT losses. I think you either get 2 or none. It's not fair that the jackets have more wins than some of these teams but because it just took them longer to lose they have more points. Just my opinion.
BlueJackets,319gt1,Bubbz1211,5,Fri Apr 3 02:14:36 2015 UTC,I think the point system should be as follows: 3pts: Regulation Win 2pts: Overtime Win 1pt: Overtime Loss 0pts: Regulation Loss
BlueJackets,319gt1,coachkrumm,5,Fri Apr 3 01:49:35 2015 UTC,what about shootout wins?
BlueJackets,319gt1,flyerfanatic93,4,Fri Apr 3 02:39:38 2015 UTC,I'd keep it as an overtime win so still 2pts
BlueJackets,319gt1,coachkrumm,2,Fri Apr 3 02:45:54 2015 UTC,I like that system
BlueJackets,319gt1,flyerfanatic93,14,Fri Apr 3 02:52:43 2015 UTC,Johansen is a fucking monster. Next year is going to be fucking amazing. I can't wait.

We have 80 points out of a possible 154, which technically is more than half, but it's still 38 wins and 39 losses even if a few were in overtime, which would mean less than half.

In the last Jackets/Pens game when Tyutin got the high sticking penalty against Crosby in the second period, she blurted out without thinking ""nice acting"" or something like that. I just stared at her and said ""you realized you just bad mouthed Crosby right?"" She denies it ever happened, but we both know the truth."

They have a remote connected to their camera that syncs the shutter to those strobes. It's like having a massive flash for your camera, necessary in such a high speed sport inside, when sunlight isn't available.   Again, I might be wrong. Sometimes I see the flash even on tv. Especially during a big shot on goal."

BlueJackets,319idz,Sirius_Cyborg,11,Fri Apr 3 02:21:08 2015 UTC,"It is pretty crazy that we've gone on this winning streak since trading him, though."
BlueJackets,319idz,THECapedCaper,7,Fri Apr 3 03:20:23 2015 UTC,idk I always thought wiz was mediocre. He really looked more like a winger to me than a defenseman. I do agree though that we need a better D. We let bob see way to many shots and with a great goalie like him plus a better all line defense we'd be unstoppable.
BlueJackets,319idz,Sirius_Cyborg,3,Fri Apr 3 02:31:49 2015 UTC,Wiz was a really offensive defenseman and that's what made him appear winger-y. I thought his higher offensive capability combined with his average defensive capability made him out top d-man.
BlueJackets,319idz,Sirius_Cyborg,5,Fri Apr 3 02:50:31 2015 UTC,But we really need someone who is going to poke check well and block shots and keep the puck in the offensive end.

BlueJackets,316zj3,dgreins15,2,Thu Apr 2 22:52:32 2015 UTC,wow. a lot of fanboys and HCTR haters here.  A lot can be gained from reminding a young player what needs to be earned to play in the NHL. Zero problems with this. And stop with the Boll in for Dano nonsense. The two have nothing to do with one another.
BlueJackets,316zj3,topcopontheforce,4,Thu Apr 2 20:07:09 2015 UTC,"How has he not earned his spot, though? Of course a lot of people are fans, for a 20 year old rookie Dano has been spectacular.   It's not nonsense. One player had to come out of the lineup for Boll to be in tonight. The only player who is out this game and wasn't last game is Dano. The one out last game who was in this game is Boll. In what way is that not Boll for Dano?"
BlueJackets,316zj3,jpsquill,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:15:06 2015 UTC,Boll didn't take Dano's spot. Morin did. Dano hasn't had a good last 4 or 5 games. Since his unreal game against Vancouver he hasn't been impressive. It's one game. A game that means nothing. No better time
BlueJackets,316zj3,topcopontheforce,2,Thu Apr 2 22:35:38 2015 UTC,"He has nine points in his last ten games. Of course he's not always going to look amazing. Nobody should expect him to always have a PPG pace at his age. But he's not been bad--and nowhere near bad enough to be the odd man out. I don't have a problem with Morin being tried on the higher lines, but Boll does not help the team by being in the lineup."
BlueJackets,316zj3,dgreins15,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:48:56 2015 UTC,"He's also been one of the best possession players on the team, while Boll has been the worst."
BlueJackets,316zj3,CBJFan,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:58:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, that too. Saw this on twitter earlier--Dano has the highest dCorsi Impact score on the team. Boll has the lowest. There's about a 200 point difference between them on that (+92 vs -110)."
BlueJackets,316zj3,topcopontheforce,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:01:30 2015 UTC,"Only 2 points in his last five games. Both second assists from passes from the NZ. Hasn't been special. I don't think he's bad. But based solely on the last game or two, I would say Morin has played better. I think watching from the stands is a better kick in the pants than just being on the fourth line. Also, the game doesn't matter. Send the message with no affect on the season when you can. People kicked and screamed when Johansen was healthy scratched in 2013 and were outraged with TR. I think things worked out ok.  I don't see where the issue is. The game means nothing. Nothing. His D zone play needs to be better. Motivate him to be better."
BlueJackets,316zj3,dgreins15,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:04:12 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of Dano as well, but I also think he's still learning.  He's done well, but he certainly hasn't earned a permanent spot in the NHL yet. The name you're forgetting is Morin.  HCTR wants to see what Morin can do higher up in the lineup, either as a reward or as an evaluation, and he wants to sit Dano.  Boll just makes it easier to slide Morin up.  Dano can learn more watching in the box than getting 7 minutes playing on the 4th line and it's also less likely to be considered a 'demotion'. Coaches do this all of the time, particularly with younger players. finally, I think they know what they have in Dano a lot more than some of these other guys. there's no time like the present to take a good look a them and how they fit with the team now that they're finally assembled as planned."
BlueJackets,316zj3,nykc,2,Thu Apr 2 20:22:48 2015 UTC,"I'm aware he wants to move Morin up (though he did start out higher up in the lineup before he was moved down). But why is Dano the odd one out? He's been producing, and regardless of line this is good development time for him. If you've gotta sit someone, why is it him? Why not, for instance, Calvert, who just got back from a concussion and could probably use a lightened load right now (shuffle some lines on that one of course)? Or hell, even Wennberg isn't putting up the same level of production, if you're sitting a rookie, which you shouldn't be. End of the year is the time you should be resting some of your older guys and letting your rookies play.  Mostly I don't get why Boll is back in in the first place. He statistically makes the team worse when he is in the lineup, he has five points in 71 games, and giving him ice time instead of someone else immediately after a three-game suspension makes it seem like the org is okay with him making suspendable hits."
BlueJackets,316zj3,AccNum3,2,Thu Apr 2 20:30:07 2015 UTC,I feel like I'm the only one with you. Who cares about this? Dano hasn't played well his last few games. So he's out. Oh well. People are acting like this is game 7 of the cup finals and the worst coaching move in history.  The best thing to ever happen to Johansen was being a healthy scratch. I also feel HCTR gets way too much flak than he deserves. All the teams positive get attributed to the players. Any thing that goes wrong is his fault. Dudes a good coach. I think his and brad Larsen are amazing with player development
BlueJackets,316zj3,TH3_Dude,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:39:15 2015 UTC,Is there more to this than just Boll coming back? Hard to believe he is the reason.

By the end of the game a woman just stood around filming me with my sign for 5+ minutes (because she was salty they lost?), a middle aged woman ran by and stole the sign out of my hands and tore it in pieces, and another dude tried to fight me outside of the arena. Kind of weird overall, but winning just feels so good!!! Got a lot of ""We'll see ya in the playoffs wink wink wink ;)"". There were some respectable fans however as well.

BlueJackets,310scb,flyerfanatic93,7,Wed Apr 1 05:21:27 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it has to do with him being a UFA after next season, in addition to having a glut of centers on the team already that are locked down for the next few years.  That, and the fact that he's a solid, big-bodied, two-way, top-6 center that teams could surely use and that would probably help draw a pretty good return if packaged."
BlueJackets,310scb,jpsquill,6,Wed Apr 1 05:35:53 2015 UTC,"Also, packaging allows us to get rid of Boll and Tropp and allow Letestu to play with real hockey players. I feel like he played so much better without those goons."

BlueJackets,310scb,jpsquill,5,Wed Apr 1 15:38:26 2015 UTC,"For me it's because Anisimov is a luxury and not needed. We have plenty of centers at the NHL/AHL level so he's playing out of position on the wing. He's an effective player, but I'd prefer to have a natural winger on our second line. We have Bjorkstrand, Milano and Rychel coming soon who need roster spots and I'm sure Anisimov will want more than a one year extension."
BlueJackets,310scb,EshinX,3,Wed Apr 1 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"All that makes perfect sense. But from my perspective as a casual fan who watches a lot of games, but who has never set food on a sheet of ice before, why him instead of the other competent centers? Personally I feel like when he's out there, he's very in control. He carries the puck into the zone and makes shit happen(fuck dump and chase), he's aware, and he plays excellent defense. Compare that to say...Dubinsky, who everyone loves, but when he's out there it just feels like he's flailing around being a pest and a (hard hitting blue jackets hockey player). This is all from an objective watch them every night perspective, and not a numbers perspective. But I like Anisimov way more than some of the other centers. No?"
BlueJackets,310scb,ResplendentOwl,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:16:14 2015 UTC,"Nobody's mentioned it, but won't Anisimov be a redundancy starting next year with the glut of Centers we have?"

BlueJackets,30tciy,adamxftl,2,Mon Mar 30 19:14:57 2015 UTC,So where do we put Boll after his suspension is over? Will they really take Morin out just to let Boll play? I hope not...
BlueJackets,30tciy,esormaj,6,Mon Mar 30 18:14:33 2015 UTC,Someone is bound to get injured before then so I don't think Boll has to worry about his roster spot unfortunately.
BlueJackets,30tciy,Veldox,6,Mon Mar 30 18:17:36 2015 UTC,I'm sure someone will find some room for him... someone who's used to taking our bad players... Like the Flyers
BlueJackets,30tciy,zarfytezz1,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:15:37 2015 UTC,The way the team talks about how much Boll helps teh team I do not think he will go anywhere. I feel like HCTR likes the fighting and people feel Boll inspires the team.... /sigh
BlueJackets,30tciy,nykc,2,Tue Mar 31 13:41:39 2015 UTC,Reddit jerks off on hating Boll because they want 4 scoring lines instead of 3 scoring lines and one break line. Boll is good on the 4th line to take people out and more importantly he usually gets a good dump in for a solid line change.
BlueJackets,30tciy,Vyse,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"Well that may be true, but can't we just let Hartnell take that roll, and actually be able to score?"

BlueJackets,30tciy,HORSEtheGAME,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:33:03 2015 UTC,Some trades will probably happen around draft time

BlueJackets,30tciy,jpsquill,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:45:23 2015 UTC,If I had to guess Tropp and Boll will be hard to trade. Maybe waiver for Tropp/Buyout for Boll.  I could see us trading away Anisimov + maybe a defenseman for a better defenseman and Rychel would take that spot. Gets rid of our log jam of centers and gives us Rychel to fill the LW spot Anisimov is in.
BlueJackets,30tciy,esormaj,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:46:19 2015 UTC,Isn't Anisimov technically a centre though?
BlueJackets,30tciy,zarfytezz1,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:09:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he's been playing on the wing a lot, and in these lines today he was slotted in a LW spot."
BlueJackets,30tciy,jpsquill,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:01:46 2015 UTC,I think think Arty will get traded or Letestu will be let go. I hope not. I also think Tropp won't get picked back up.

BlueJackets,30tciy,BlueJacketsNHL,2,Tue Mar 31 01:05:30 2015 UTC,"He's probably actually a top 9, but we've got that all filled up at the moment (which is something we haven't had all year) and isn't really consistent enough to be in our top 6. I like him a lot, but he's not top 6."

Injuries everywhere! More push ups! More sit ups! More reps!"" Wennberg could not contain himself.  ""It will be better next season,"" /u/ScarletWitch65 said to him, with a reassuring touch to his shoulder. ""The Hockey Gods will be kinder to us, and the retched Penguins will be the next ones to meet an untimely demise!""

""Not only that, but Ovechkin will catch the mumps, and Connor McDavid will be drafted by the Hurricanes and be subject to eternal mediocrity.""

You should be sloshed until about halfway through May, that'll probably do the job.  As far as being a Blue Jackets fan goes, prepare to eternally ponder the question, ""How can a hockey team be so fucking cute, christ?"" No, really, I face this problem regularly. Nick Foligno and Ryan Johansen are fucking JD/Turk adorable sometimes and Bobrovsky hugs never get old.  A quick ""how to feel on things"" list (subjective and not exhaustive, anyone who disagrees, I'm too tired to care):   Jeff Carter. Fuck that asshole and his ugly mug. Kings fans have literally nothing to add in most Blue Jackets related dealings than ""isnt it time for our third cup-winning CBJ trade? yuk yuk yuk"" so fuck them too. They can dry their tears on their championship memorabilia. They can even pick the year! Fuck the Pens. You understand why, we understand why. Nothing personal. Rick Nash is okay. Gave us as much as he could, requested a trade that was overall good for us. Bobs and Rick had a heated exchange a while ago, so there's a bit of animosity there for some people, but overall no hate. Bruins suck, Lucic got OHKO'd by Prout after cheapshotting him, which should always be brought up until Lucic's out of the league. Our thirds are THE SHIT   I'm done rambling, enjoy watching one hell of a team, should they manage to stay on the ice all at once next year. Figures a Pittsburgh sports fan would have to root for an Ohio sports team right as they're getting good. Coincidence is a funny thing."

BlueJackets,30kcsc,imbored343,8,Sat Mar 28 03:08:32 2015 UTC,Two hat tricks in a row! I'm so happy!  Also..THE ONE DAMN TIME I DON'T GUESS CONNAUTON FOR THE GWG DAMMIT.  That was a solid game from both teams that entire game.
BlueJackets,30kcsc,ScarletWitch65,8,Sat Mar 28 03:06:29 2015 UTC,Damn i put Cam for GWG haha
BlueJackets,30kcsc,Aperture-Employee,3,Sat Mar 28 03:07:32 2015 UTC,I feel like it should count a little..
BlueJackets,30kcsc,buckeye_baker,10,Sat Mar 28 03:07:48 2015 UTC,"That GDT was weird. All the regulars were fine from both sides but there were a bunch of people I didn't recognize from both sides throwing some shade. And there was 1-2 people constantly downvoting anything a CBJ fan would say.  Grats to Cam on his hatty, let's keep on rolling tomorrow night!"
BlueJackets,30kcsc,Aperture-Employee,5,Sat Mar 28 03:11:39 2015 UTC,I will say Hawks fans are generally pretty cool in GDTs. They were reasonable about calls (like the goal that got called off) and good-spirited. I feel like they are the one of the few large fan bases who has that going on.
BlueJackets,30kcsc,buckeye_baker,1 point,Sat Mar 28 10:47:20 2015 UTC,Are you sure you aren't just saying that because I drafted you?

BlueJackets,30kcsc,yankeesfan13,3,Sat Mar 28 03:31:52 2015 UTC,And Cam with 19 goals and 6 games left. He probably won't reach 25 but 22 goals is certainly within reach for him.
BlueJackets,30kcsc,iamamystery20,3,Sat Mar 28 03:46:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, for sure. The general sentiment I've seen is that 25-ish is probably his ceiling, but considering he missed a couple of games with an arm sprain he's certainly not doing badly for himself this season."

BlueJackets,30kcsc,highvoltorb,3,Sat Mar 28 15:07:35 2015 UTC,Solid game. A solid 60 minute effort tonight.
BlueJackets,30kcsc,Veldox,3,Sat Mar 28 03:08:17 2015 UTC,"Now that we are winning, thinking back to our losing streak really sucks.  You could tell that there was an attitude of ""it's not our fault, half the team is hurt"".  If they could have just pushed out another 2-3 wins, we would have a decent shot at the playoffs now (not great, but probably at least 10-20%)."
BlueJackets,30kcsc,highvoltorb,3,Sat Mar 28 03:12:21 2015 UTC,Just few wins at home would have really helped.

BlueJackets,30kcsc,jt4,2,Sat Mar 28 03:34:18 2015 UTC,Maybe. And I don't blame them either if that's the case. I was told it was more because I posted three comments within about 30 seconds all trying to anger their fans. I was spamming I guess. I've literally never done anything like that before. Whatever.

Right? I mean, Washington is at 90, and Ottawa and Boston are tied at 85. The chances of all the of those teams failing to hit 90 while we somehow make up 19 points are, for all practical purposes, zero."

BlueJackets,30emrg,justthetip751,2,Fri Mar 27 06:53:36 2015 UTC,If you're going to a hockey game you shouldn't wear a hat you don't want to give up.

BlueJackets,30dsq9,Tropist,9,Thu Mar 26 16:15:09 2015 UTC,And he forfeits ~$28000 for the three games.  He makes about as much in three games being a goon/bench warmer as I do getting bitched at by meth heads and retail pigs in a year.
BlueJackets,30dsq9,THECapedCaper,16,Thu Mar 26 17:55:36 2015 UTC,I am sure they didn't even consider the impact this was going to have on the roster before handing down this ridiculously unfair punishment.  He will be back before the end of the season. That is totally going to screw us.

BlueJackets,30dsq9,johnny5_is_alive,5,Thu Mar 26 20:22:21 2015 UTC,I agree with the punishment. Can we discuss the inconsistency of the DoPS suspending based on injury? From previous suspensions they seem to suspend based on injury more than anything. Maroon was not injured so I figured it would be 2 games max. With recent other dangerous checks not even being suspended around the league the DoPS certainly seem more and more a joke. Did Boll get 3 games based on reputation or that we are not a playoff team this year? I'm just curious what everyone else thinks?
BlueJackets,30dsq9,infiniteshadow,3,Thu Mar 26 16:16:28 2015 UTC,Boll was suspended once and fined twice before for checks to the head. I think reputation has a lot to do with it.
BlueJackets,30dsq9,infiniteshadow,3,Thu Mar 26 16:19:54 2015 UTC,I didn't realize he had been fined recently as well.  I only saw in the previous thread that he was suspended in 2008 (seven years ago...) for an end-of-game instigator penalty vs. Carolina.
BlueJackets,30dsq9,buckeye_baker,7,Thu Mar 26 16:22:11 2015 UTC,Can we self-impose more games?
BlueJackets,30dsq9,el_karacho,6,Thu Mar 26 16:23:08 2015 UTC,Definitely seems like a fair punishment. Will be interesting to see what line combos we get out of this.  Here is the video explanation.
BlueJackets,30dsq9,yankeesfan13,3,Thu Mar 26 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing with the suspension, but rather I wonder if the NHL will have a conversation with Bruce Boudreau about his decision to let Maroon re-enter the game and subsequently fight Prout given the apparent severity of his ""injury"" at the time of the hit.  I hate to say it but the NFL seems to have a more sensible concussion prevention/mitigation protocol than the NHL."
BlueJackets,30dsq9,Ohm_My_God,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:21:16 2015 UTC,"I'd hope so. Concussion safety requires prevention, testing, and treatment. If a player might have a concussion, he shouldn't play until he is evaluated. While Boll was more malicious, playing a potentially hurt player contributes as much to the problem than the hit itself."
BlueJackets,30dsq9,HermanBonJovi,3,Fri Mar 27 07:06:59 2015 UTC,"At first I thought 3 games was too much, 1 or 2 more appropriate, then I saw the comment about being fined twice previously for checks to the head.  I didn't know he had been fined for that specific offense before.  I don't think his previous suspension should be factored into this, however.  It's an entirely different type of rules violation and was quite a long time ago."

The puck carrier dips his head down at the end, and it drives me crazy the rules now protect guys who make themselves vulnerable. Either way, that play and ensuing fight Boll's next shift turned the tide in our favor. If I were coaching Boll, I wouldn't tell him to change a thing."
BlueJackets,3094pu,xanbo,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:44:53 2015 UTC,I said blatant just because when Toronto watches it in slow motion you cant miss it
BlueJackets,3094pu,overcatastrophe,2,Wed Mar 25 22:27:55 2015 UTC,Gotcha.
BlueJackets,3094pu,xanbo,3,Wed Mar 25 22:48:14 2015 UTC,"Last night, Boll was a star :)"
BlueJackets,3094pu,overcatastrophe,2,Wed Mar 25 22:52:10 2015 UTC,Absolutely.
BlueJackets,3094pu,xanbo,6,Wed Mar 25 23:03:06 2015 UTC,Here are a couple of angles of the hit in question courtesy of @MyRegularFace:  Angle 1  Angle 2
BlueJackets,3094pu,GeekYogurt,3,Wed Mar 25 14:27:05 2015 UTC,Angle 2 is a lot worse.
BlueJackets,3094pu,flyerfanatic93,3,Wed Mar 25 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"That doesn't look good. In angle 2 it shows that the head is the principal point of contact. Has Boll been suspended before? If not I could see 1 maybe 2 games. If he has been suspended before, I could see 2 and mayyybe 3, although 3 is unlikely."
BlueJackets,3094pu,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Wed Mar 25 14:53:28 2015 UTC,He was last suspended at the end of October 2008 against Carolina. He will probably get a couple of games slap on the wrist.

BlueJackets,3094pu,justthetip751,2,Wed Mar 25 14:14:28 2015 UTC,"I wasn't too upset initially with his new contract, bust now that we have a few other guys that can drop gloves and throw their weight around, as well as make good defensive plays and get down the ice in a relatively quick manner, he's just dead weight.  I dunno if he just got old (he's my age) or if he isn't trying as hard, but its apparent that he's lost his edge"
BlueJackets,3094pu,TweetPoster,3,Wed Mar 25 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Everyone here for the most part damns Boll, but he's never been a big time point scorer (in the NHL at least), and continues that trend this year also, but when it's time to drop the gloves he hasn't disappointed. He chec ks the Hell out of people when he does hit the ice, and stirs NWA up pretty well with his fights and hits. I'd say he's doing his job pretty fine. If he was on line 2 or something I could see hating him and being upset, but he isn't. And he serves his 4th line duties well."

BlueJackets,3094pu,xam2y,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:10:38 2015 UTC,"I was sitting in front of another hit he layed on a person that put him in the box. From my perspective he left his feet to lay on a hit. Was lucky he did not get boarding, luckily the hit did not land for that. He was on a mission last night. Then again we have a long history of physical games with the ducks. Post game was talking about how his fight was the thing that turned the tide and won the game for the team. I feel like Prouter and Hartsy can take care of the enforcing. /sidenote -- When Dano was mixxing it up was awesome to see Hartnell supporting him afterwards... he is so good for that young line."
BlueJackets,3094pu,bobboman,-1,Wed Mar 25 16:40:33 2015 UTC,Is it wrong of me to hope our own player gets suspended? Maybe HCTR will get the message and put a more competent player who doesn't constantly bring Letestu down.
BlueJackets,3094pu,Drithyin,-1,Wed Mar 25 15:14:38 2015 UTC,to do that you need to be rid of both tropp and boll
BlueJackets,3094pu,xam2y,2,Wed Mar 25 17:21:57 2015 UTC,"to do that you need to be rid of both tropp and boll of the guys that woke the team up with physical plays/fights in recent games and turned the tide of the whole game, yielding come-from-behind wins   FTFY  edit: I just defended Boll...

BlueJackets,3094pu,Drithyin,4,Wed Mar 25 17:36:46 2015 UTC,"If we had 2 good players plus letestu on the 4th line, we would not need to be woken up because we would already be ahead of the other team"
BlueJackets,3094pu,bobboman,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:39:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, let's just run to the ""good player"" store on Broad and pick up a pair.    I mean, how many players are on the IR right now? We would have some pretty stacked lines if not for that. They are the better options (especially considering things like 1-way contracts) right now. Plus, it fucking worked. They turned the game around and are a big part of why they won.   And let's not living in the fantasy world where marginal improvements on the 4th line suddenly make slumping goal scorers or stone-footed defensemen better."
BlueJackets,3095qg,bboydfresh,16,Wed Mar 25 14:18:47 2015 UTC,I think trading a first pick for Phil Kessel would be a horrible mistake for the Jackets.
BlueJackets,3095qg,Tigershark2112,12,Wed Mar 25 15:28:41 2015 UTC,"First round picks are too fucking valuable this draft. Especially with how high up ours will be. Any other year, maybe, but not this one."
BlueJackets,3095qg,esormaj,3,Wed Mar 25 15:48:57 2015 UTC,Agree. We already took one of Toronto problems. Kessel is good but I have read he is not great in the locker room. I would rather have a youngster. I have faith in our current roster outside an upgrade on defense
BlueJackets,3095qg,Back41DayOnly,4,Wed Mar 25 16:33:18 2015 UTC,I've heard that he's incredibly coachable!
BlueJackets,3095qg,triforce28,20,Wed Mar 25 17:45:12 2015 UTC,I'd be alright with it. Not sure management wants to take on that kind of money though. Not sure what Phil's contract situation is but the Horton/clarkson deal happened because of a team imposed money restriction. I also don't know anything about the prospects outside of mcdavid and eichel. I guess what I'm saying is that I have no business trying to answer this and chose to anyway
BlueJackets,3095qg,flyerfanatic93,9,Wed Mar 25 14:30:44 2015 UTC,That last sentence made me laugh haha

If Toronto added like 50% retained I would jump on it over taking McDavid.  Don't get me wrong, he's going to be awesome, but I just feel like he's going to have a huge target painted on him the second he starts to play, and Columbus already has a reputation for being physical. I'm probably in the minority but I don't think he'd be a good fit here."
BlueJackets,3095qg,THECapedCaper,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"I fully understand that I'm crazy when I say it, but then I realize that there's a chance we could see him in a Canes uniform and Dubinsky gets matched up against him just like Crosby. And if that matchup is any indication, Dubi is going to have his fucking way with him.  Then I imagine McDavid in a Blue Jackets uniform and having to witness the opposite happen every game."
BlueJackets,3095qg,shoshinzen,5,Wed Mar 25 22:27:57 2015 UTC,"As low as we'll be in the draft, no first rounder is worth taking Kessel."

BlueJackets,3095qg,jimmydodo,2,Wed Mar 25 19:01:26 2015 UTC,"This idea was repeatedly shot down in /r/leafs because it values Kessel at less than a 1st round pick (by adding a cap dump).

BlueJackets,3095qg,Dirkz,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:33:13 2015 UTC,Last time this rumor floated around it was more realistic for the Jackets... at the moment he's not a piece that fits with their roster unless they part ways with several forwards.

We DO need young prospective drafts so that in 4-5 years we can start the CBJ Dynasty. I, for one, wouldn't be interested in trading much of anything for Phil Kessel."
BlueJackets,3095qg,burnie08,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:14:28 2015 UTC,"I went over and checked out the thread. I agree that a trade makes sense between our two teams, but I don't think management will do it. The internal cap makes things a bit more difficult for sure. But the main reason I think it wouldn't happen is that management likes our talent pool way too much to let any of them go. You guys were talking about Wennberg and Dano. After their progression this year, they are most certainly off the table. Although crazier stuff has happened."
BlueJackets,3095qg,infiniteshadow,16,Thu Mar 26 19:52:20 2015 UTC,I would riot if Dano got traded.
BlueJackets,3095qg,TheDoubleL27,4,Wed Mar 25 15:03:50 2015 UTC,"When watching that ""Behind the Battle"" series about those guys getting drafted, Jarmo seemed the most excited about him compared to the other scouts and somewhat reassured the staff away from trading down. Hopefully this means he doesn't see Dano being moved."
BlueJackets,3095qg,jpsquill,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"A lot of people seemed to be surprised when Dano was drafted 27th, and I think a lot of scouts and experts didn't expect him to go in the first round, so Jarmo definitely saw something special in him and took a gamble, and thankfully it has paid off (so far)."

BlueJackets,307f52,Logosmonkey,2,Wed Mar 25 02:06:16 2015 UTC,Ugh. One of the few games I miss and Hartsy pots a hatty.
BlueJackets,307f52,infiniteshadow,2,Wed Mar 25 02:24:54 2015 UTC,Before the game last night I bought a Hartnell home jersey that I had been eyeing for the past few weeks and then sometime during the second period I lost my toque. Then Hartsy got his hattie.  What I'm saying is - I'm magical.
BlueJackets,307f52,Back41DayOnly,2,Wed Mar 25 02:32:26 2015 UTC,Sounds like you have to buy a new jersey before every game now.   Sorry
BlueJackets,307f52,Logosmonkey,3,Wed Mar 25 14:00:08 2015 UTC,Buy a Bobrovski jersey so we can see a goalie hat trick!!!

BlueJackets,304ppz,cbjfan51,2,Tue Mar 24 15:37:48 2015 UTC,Being a fragile player and NHL ready can be very different things. The skills are more than ready. I dunno if his body will ever allow it.
BlueJackets,304ppz,TheZiggurat614,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:42:43 2015 UTC,"Being ready for the NHL doesn't just involve skills. I agree that he's there, but he can't get healthy."

We are seeing what I think will be a continuing issue for him, so I basically don't think a healthy Murray is in the cards at all. You can sit him or whatever but he will come back, fall down, and head to the locker room again."

He has a top-6 potential written all over him. And from what I understand, he plays in every scenario as well."
BlueJackets,302kgn,WannabeFinn,4,Tue Mar 24 05:04:28 2015 UTC,If we put this kid on a line with Johansen he's easily going to be a 20 goal scorer. Johansen's playmaking abilities with Bjorkstrand's lethal shot just make it too easy.
BlueJackets,302kgn,andrewdt10,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:39:30 2015 UTC,They'll certainly have a few games to try it towards the end of the NHL season if they're so inclined.

We've got a good thing going finally with our system when the team is healthy and messing with that on a gamble would be really risky. Not to mention the money we would have to pay him.

They literally traded someone who probably won't play again for someone who can. They didn't want to pay a guy $26 million to sit in the stands."
BlueJackets,30371v,Logosmonkey,6,Tue Mar 24 05:08:28 2015 UTC,"Well, they did do a little thinking outside the box. Typically no other team would want a large, uninsured contract for an aging player who will likely never play again.

As good of a player as Kovy could be, the guy is on the wrong side of 30 and has injury issues.

TBH, I think that he had pretty much proved everything that he could prove in the WHL during the 2013-14 season.  That was 50 goals and 59 points in 69 games.  If he had been only a few months older he would have played in the AHL this season, but since he will not be 20 until April he got to victimize the WHL for another year.  :-)  By all rights he was playing one level down from where he really should have been.  It would be comparable to having a hot NHL rookie like Johnny Gaudreau (who made the ASG in his rookie season) playing in the AHL this season instead.  I'm sure that he will do well in the AHL, but I would be surprised if his numbers look as great when he's up against a higher caliber of competition."

I'm not sure how helpful this will be because I don't know how easy this is to replicate, but here you go.  1) I have a hockeystreams account, so that's how I watch live/archived games. Gamecenter Live serves the same purpose obviously. Never looked into a tuner card or any of that.  2) I use FRAPS to capture the video (which does cost money, although I'm sure there are ways around it), though there have to be other capturing programs available. That's just the one I'm familiar with and it allows you to capture at 60 fps, which is what hockeystreams uses.  3) I capture the part I want to GIF in full-screen mode and then edit it using video editing software (Adobe Premiere Pro, to be exact, that I have through work). And all I'm doing is cutting off parts I don't need at the beginning/end, so you really don't need this step if you time the capture well enough. Plus that makes it easier to find cheap/free software because you're not doing a ton with it.  4) Gfycat lets you just throw the video on there and keep good quality, so that's what I use for longer GIFs. If it's real short I'll go through Photoshop and all that (totally different thing) to put on Twitter or something, but lately I've been using this way because it's easier and looks good.  That's pretty much it. It's just getting the video and uploading it to Gfycat at this point. Sometimes people on imgur make guides but I don't know how quickly the GIF world changes (for a while they were big on gifcam, but I don't think we're talking high-res 60fps for that?). Hopefully that helps, thanks and good luck!"

BlueJackets,2zumgs,humpcatting,14,Sat Mar 21 22:51:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe that if we hadn't been absolutely fucked by injuries, we'd be in the playoffs this season. It hurts so much because of how much fucking talent we actually have."
BlueJackets,2zumgs,HermanBonJovi,7,Sat Mar 21 23:00:24 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%.  We would be right there with NYR and NYI fighting them for a spot, and maybe the division."
BlueJackets,2zumgs,AtTheRink,2,Sat Mar 21 23:07:51 2015 UTC,"So true.  Which makes it even more annoying.  Think of it strictly in terms of Bob.  He's played 42 games.  Carey Price, Holtby, Rask have all played 59 and up games.  So let's say Bob was 100% the whole year, like the other goalies mentioned.  He would probably played 20 more games than he has (espec. if we are in playoff hunt)  I could easily see Bob going .500 over those 20 games ( I actually think he would be better than .500).  That's an additional 20 points.  That puts us tied with Pittsburgh and within solid grasp of playoff spots.   I think the past two week has shown that we are a good team and we were ruined by injuries.  I think Richards is safe.  I think everyone is safe.  This season has been a nightmare.  But it seems like we are finally waking up out of it.  The future is so bright.  We are going have an extremely tough line up to make next year if Bjork, Sonny, Wenny, Dano, Rychel and not to mention Boone and Murray are all at 100% and maturing."
BlueJackets,2zumgs,HermanBonJovi,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:36:23 2015 UTC,"Plus more than likely a top 10 pick and maybe Reilly signing.  If the hockey gods dont fuck us over again, we will be a very dangerous team."

Honestly, I'm so fucking excited for next year. I know that's a pretty loser sentiment, but it's true. If we have even 2/3 of the injuries that we had this year, we'll be a great team. Bob is solid, RyJo got flow, Foligno has crazy eyes, and the Marko Dano Pain Train is unstoppable.  This season sucked for a lot of uncontrollable reasons. Come next year, however... Oh man."
BlueJackets,2zumgs,highvoltorb,9,Sat Mar 21 23:01:13 2015 UTC,"So that makes 4 goals in 8 games with the Jackets and 2 goals in 30 games with the Ducks for Bourque. That boarding hit the other night made me question him, but I think he might work out better than expected."
BlueJackets,2zumgs,THECapedCaper,7,Sat Mar 21 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"That's just crazy. Anaheim must not have been a good locker room to him, or maybe he's starting to realize that he needs to step up his game or be sent to Springfield.  Either way, I hope he goes back to his good production days."

BlueJackets,2zumgs,topcopontheforce,2,Sun Mar 22 00:12:53 2015 UTC,Imo it was a pretty clear make-up call for the wacky embellishment call on Gadreau earlier. But theoretically it was that you can't play the puck until you have both feet out of the penalty box and he only had one. I've just never seen that called before in a game.

Happy for Bourque doing some good work lately and I hope it is just that the CBJ locker room is a good fit for him and he generally wants to get back to the star player he used to be. Bob stood on his head and made great saves again. Boone and Mo looked a little rusty but that was to be expected considering they've missed so much time due to injuries.   It felt good to play spoiler to a couple of Western playoff teams these past few days. Fuck the tank! I like seeing the boys win and knocking some of these playoff contenders off their high horses!  It's been a rough season but with all the adversity the boys have faced this season, I hope they can use it to be a monster of a team next season. And yes, I have been drinking (in celebration for a change)!"

BlueJackets,2zumgs,XdefeatsY,2,Sat Mar 21 23:10:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like he has shown to be a solid D-man as of late. I know he's a UFA at the end of the season so I'm not sure if the CBJ will re-sign him or let him go. I'd like to see him stay for at least another year but if they think there is better D talent available in the pipeline, I can live with it if they decide to let him go."
BlueJackets,2zumgs,Noler61,2,Sat Mar 21 23:24:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bad idea to let him walk, especially after one season. Better to have an extra 7th dman, and he's still finding his game, I am sure."
BlueJackets,2zumgs,XdefeatsY,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:41:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If it was up to me I'd like to see him signed for at least another year. Considering he had that injury that kept him out for a while this season and then went down to Springy for conditioning -- ever since he's been back, he has been a solid D-man IMO. Even more so because Ryan Murray is apparently made of glass and as much as I'd like to see him stay healthy, I think keeping a 7th D-man with some experience just to be safe is the right way to go."

BlueJackets,2zrd7d,gonzarro,4,Sat Mar 21 05:58:22 2015 UTC,I guess he had a cut stitched up on his hand recently. Fucking bizarre
BlueJackets,2zrd7d,THECapedCaper,5,Sat Mar 21 00:31:38 2015 UTC,Cut hand + the biological fauna that is the inside of a hockey glove = ewww!
BlueJackets,2zrd7d,gmann2388,2,Sat Mar 21 00:32:56 2015 UTC,So wait would the medical staff not sanitize the area before putting stitches back in? Or not wrap the area before letting him play again?  Ugh.
BlueJackets,2zrd7d,xam2y,2,Sat Mar 21 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna guess the wrap came off (sweat and movement), he took it off(feel/control), or the hockey funk inside of the gloves can still permeate through."
BlueJackets,2zrd7d,Noler61,2,Sat Mar 21 12:17:34 2015 UTC,"The CBJ medical staff has made several very questionable decisions lately. They know better than to do this. It is on them to tell Wennberg what crazy zombie disease he can get if he doesn't keep his cut sanitized or covered up.  Team doctors my ass. A doctor takes the patient's best interest into mind, and with the recent strings of injuries, the opposite has appeared to be the case."

BlueJackets,2zo1y9,xam2y,2,Fri Mar 20 06:35:02 2015 UTC,"Put it on the table, mable!   -Bob McElligott  What the fuck does that even mean?"
BlueJackets,2zo1y9,Swabeky,2,Fri Mar 20 04:38:34 2015 UTC,"He just get's so excited.  and I realized I probably have my announcer names wrong.  Bob is cool, Rimer is the one I could care less for."
BlueJackets,2zo1y9,xam2y,2,Fri Mar 20 04:48:15 2015 UTC,What's so bad about Rimer?
BlueJackets,2zo1y9,Swabeky,6,Fri Mar 20 04:51:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's really passionate about CBJ hockey versus just hockey in general; He's just going through the motions. I watch a lot of Senators games and I think the difference is that the guys who call the sens games love the sens, I think Rimer loves the Jackets as much as his pay check.  I'm sure he's a fan and would always have a soft spot for the team but he doesn't live and breathe it as much.  Dudes smart and he knows hockey not trying to say that and I'm not trying to say he could care less for this team, We just haven't had announcers that grew up as kids watching CBJ games and being fans for life.    edit: I also haven't watched a lot of home broadcasts recently so maybe I should tune back in and see if I'm just being stupid.  But Bob makes me life so that has to count for something.  also it's a radio broadcast..."
BlueJackets,2zo1y9,lonecoachmcguirk,3,Fri Mar 20 04:52:19 2015 UTC,"I sort of agree on Rimer. Jody as the man next to him in the booth is fixing your concern about ""We just haven't had announcers that grew up as kids watching CBJ games and being fans for life."" The franchise is only 15 years old and still the youngest franchise (off the top of my head at least) so it'll be a bit longer before we have announcers like that -- but having Jody Shelley up there warms your heart."

BlueJackets,2zj5hn,Ticov1,22,Thu Mar 19 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"If true, this is huge. I cannot stress how good of a move this would be. NE Ohio hockey fans don't have an NHL team to root for and this will give them a reason (other than the fact Columbus is in Ohio) to pick up the Jackets as their NHL team. This move is long overdue, and should expand the Jackets' fanbase considerably."
BlueJackets,2zj5hn,AKlep,9,Thu Mar 19 00:31:37 2015 UTC,"Really? Because most NE Ohio hockey fans I've ever met are Penguins fans.  Don't get me wrong, I'd love to have our affiliate here in Ohio, but I doubt that it will overturn any particular loyalties."
BlueJackets,2zj5hn,notwhoithink,9,Thu Mar 19 01:32:17 2015 UTC,"It won't overturn existing loyalties. It'll stir up interest amongst fans who don't already have an NHL team or children who go to the Monsters games and want to root for a particular player they see once that player reaches the NHL. Most NE Ohio Pens fans became Pens fan pre-2000 because the Pens were, geographically speaking, the closest team to Cleveland. I think the demographic of NE OH hockey fans will shift dramatically over the next 10-15 years. I could be wrong, but it seems like there are no negative outcomes with this move. It can only increase interest in the club, shorten travel time when the CBJ need to call up a player, and give the AHL players a bigger crowd to play in front of (I believe Monsters were 3rd in AHL attendance)."
BlueJackets,2zj5hn,AKlep,7,Thu Mar 19 02:11:11 2015 UTC,Don't discredit the impact a swing city has on interest in the parent club.  Look no further than the Indians' affiliate in Columbus.
BlueJackets,2zj5hn,nunoveaux,2,Thu Mar 19 02:04:39 2015 UTC,"You'll have to be more specific in your example. As far as I recall, at least half of us in Columbus were Cleveland Indians fans before the deal worth the Clippers."
BlueJackets,2zj5hn,notwhoithink,1 point,Thu Mar 19 10:02:08 2015 UTC,"As someone else said, it's not the current fans we want to convert, it's the new fans who are inspired to follow the NHL team because of the AHL team.  The Clippers as an Indians affiliate inspires the not-so diehards, people who may not follow a team, and especially young kids to pay a little more attention to the big club. This translates into time following prospects who get a call-up on STO, buying merchandise, and even making a trip to Cleveland to watch him play."

BlueJackets,2zj5hn,TheDoubleL27,3,Thu Mar 19 05:11:02 2015 UTC,"For all the hand-wringing about how good this move will be for proximity, part of me is worried that we're going to be losing a stellar affiliate that has helped us produce quality NHLers:  Atkinson, Calvert, Johansen, Moore, Savard, Prout in just a few short years. Not to mention that guys like Dano, Rychel, Anderson, and Madaisky have the golden touch this year.   The first 10 years of this franchise was marked by a lot of prospects moving through the minor leagues and dropping off there, getting the odd call-up and looking incredibly out of place in the big leagues... when suddenly in the last few years we've had some that have finally ""clicked"" and been part of this organization's revival.  EDIT: Portzline suggesting that nothing is set in stone:   Lots of chatter about the upcoming #AHL 'musical chairs,' but told the full picture of who's going where is ""far from settled."""
BlueJackets,2zj5hn,nunoveaux,4,Thu Mar 19 01:33:26 2015 UTC,"While you make a very valid point... Aren't the staff of the AHL teams under contract with technically the NHL team they're affiliated to? In other words, won't we get not just the players but also the coaches?"
BlueJackets,2zj5hn,gmann2388,2,Thu Mar 19 01:58:24 2015 UTC,"This is true, but not every level of an organization is managed by the parent club. For example, Facilities, Ticket Sales, and Marketing are managed by the AHL team.  There are even oddball things like Quality-of-life in a market that can show up off and on the ice. (I'll be very interested to see how the AHL Sharks manage to live in one of the highest housing cost regions in the US)  I'm sure someone here might be far better versed on the AHL side of things that could answer better."

BlueJackets,2zj5hn,nunoveaux,2,Thu Mar 19 14:27:13 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. That makes sense.  I would hope it'd be a good relationship in Cleveland, as the show they give to fans up there is great. I'd also say for a non-hockey town and an AHL team, the Monsters seem to pull a decent crowd."

BlueJackets,2zj5hn,esormaj,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:10:39 2015 UTC,The coaching staff and players signed by CBJ will move with the team. Players signed to AHL contracts won't move. The equipment staff also stay in Spfld.
BlueJackets,2zj5hn,manandaduck,2,Thu Mar 19 14:39:26 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about this proposal as a Jackets fan...  Positives: CBJ-signed players and AHL coaches from Springy would move to Cleveland, Less travel time for players going back and forth, Perhaps the affiliation with a AHL team in Ohio with good attendance would help strengthen Ohio hockey fandom, Jackets fans in/around Ohio could make more regular trips to check out the farm team.  Cons: Some of the leadership in Springy as I understand it are just signed to AHL contracts, Springy has been great for developing our younger players IMO -- so why change a good thing?, What seems like small changes (different equipment staff, etc) might have noticeable effects on players, As someone who spent a good chunk of his childhood growing up 10 minutes from Springy and just happened to move to Columbus as a kid right before the Jackets franchise started up -- I have a kind of nostalgic connection to the team in Springfield as someone who grew up playing youth hockey in that area.  Regardless, I don't see this happening for at least another year considering they're already shaking up the minors, moving some AHL teams to the West to be closer to their NHL affiliate teams."

They use the Schott for OSU men's hockey and they close off parts of the upper deck with a curtain to make it feel like the arena is full.

BlueJackets,2zchv5,flyerfanatic93,4,Tue Mar 17 13:13:42 2015 UTC,"To me, it seems all the questions are on his side. The Jackets have done everything they can to show that they are a desirable organization to play for. It's all up to him.  The questions he has to sort out are whether the Jackets can provide him the role he wants, if he believes this season is a fluke or if he thinks the Jackets won't compete any time soon. He can't be thinking about money all that much, because he will get an ELC wherever he goes. Maybe he's worried the Jackets won't pay when the ELC runs out. Dunno.  I see no reason why he wouldn't. I mean he could pair with Ryan Murray and they could be the dominating D pair in the league in 3 years."
BlueJackets,2zchv5,stupidchange,10,Tue Mar 17 13:29:15 2015 UTC,"All rational points, but don't forget he's a human being who can write himself a ticket to living almost anywhere he wants in USA/Canada. Maybe he's a Wild fan... or maybe he's always dreamed of living in NYC. Maybe he has a girlfriend in Miami, who knows... As fans we only get to judge the empirical/stats side because that's all we ever have access too. I made the same point with Wiz. We'll never know why he was actually traded.  Edit: evidence? http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/2zchx4/mike_reilly/cphqtkd"
BlueJackets,2zchv5,GeekYogurt,3,Tue Mar 17 15:23:03 2015 UTC,Ok I can understand this. Answer one more question for me... what was the point of drafting him if he could just sign with anyone after college? I don't really get that...
BlueJackets,2zchv5,gmann2388,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:11:50 2015 UTC,"This is the million dollar question. What's the point in the draft of these kids can get a free ride through college and then pick* what team they go to afterward?   Why not force them to sign with a team and if they want out bad enough they have to convince the team they want to go to trade something worthwhile to the drafting team? I hope this rumor is false and he just wants to focus on finishing college before he signs with us, I lost a bit of respect for Joey this off-season for stringing it out as long as he did. (yes, I know we don't know the whole story but it still seemed pretty).   *only if they're good enough and will have a desirable position of play for enough teams to become a commodity."
BlueJackets,2zchv5,Millgasm,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:00:11 2015 UTC,That is my reasoning as well. The Jackets have really given him no reason not to sign with them.

Who knows what was said? I wasn't on the bench and I wasn't the one arguing. Someone asked what the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was and I told him that it was for abuse of the officials, and now your stupid ass wants to argue with me about why someone from Carolina chose to argue about the goal.

BlueJackets,2z4mvh,chunkymonkeychow,2,Sun Mar 15 17:02:18 2015 UTC,I have 2 half season and 1 quarter season in the shoot once end lower bowl. The shoot once end is generally cheaper when you buy the packages. Just grab some tickets close to where you want to be before you drop coin on it. I chose shoot once because I like watching Bob do work (section 119)
BlueJackets,2z4mvh,junk-trunk,4,Mon Mar 16 00:52:35 2015 UTC,Exactly. Shoot once = Bob twice.

BlueJackets,2z4mvh,esormaj,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:03:59 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, you should try out the seats. I considered moving next season and asked my ticket rep to switch my seats for a game, wasn't an issue at all. I decided to not renew at all, hopefully once the season starts, but that's beside the point. If you have a ticket (sales) rep that has been in contact with you, you should ask them. They will be more than willing to help you out.  If you still are not sure, I recommend that you start paying for the cheapest option. At the select a seat event in June (or any time later) you can change your seats and just have to pay the price difference. Where if you move from a more expensive section to a less expensive section I believe that you lose the extra money that you've paid. That was my understanding when I asked my rep about it this time last year.  My thoughts on seats is that it really comes down to personal preference. All of the views are good in their own way. I met a few people over the last 2 seasons, wouldn't call them friends, but most of the people around me are 10-20 years older than me, so that's a factor.   With that said, I do think that the club end is pretty reasonably priced, considering the additional amenities you get on that floor. The price point also includes C1, which is a corner view. Mezzanine will give you the same view from the shoot once end. So, if you don't care about the club floor's amenities and would rather see Bob twice, mezzanine is a good option. Or you could try to get as low as you can in the upper bowl. It's a tough call, I'd sample."
BlueJackets,2z388k,hockeyspy,6,Sun Mar 15 03:32:46 2015 UTC,Philly getting McDavid is fucking disgusting.  I like Provorov. I want him or Werenski with our pick unless we're top 5. Maybe then I say we go BPA and take Strome/Marner over those guys but drafting a top end D fills an organizational need.
BlueJackets,2z388k,WannabeFinn,4,Sun Mar 15 06:08:03 2015 UTC,Just watch -- It'll be Bettman's 'gift' to Ed Snider to help the Flyers finally win a Cup in this era.  I for one look forward to Dubinsky beating the tar out of him in his rookie season.
BlueJackets,2z388k,nunoveaux,4,Sun Mar 15 06:40:21 2015 UTC,"I can totally see that, actually. Most likely Metro situation is Carolina getting him, I would have no problem Dubi getting lined up against him like Crosby.  Welcome to the big leagues, kid."

BlueJackets,2z0xu0,flyerfanatic93,5,Sat Mar 14 15:30:03 2015 UTC,The fact his season ended this way bums me out. Let's remember the good times: When Umby blocked a shot a with his face and gave out the primary assist to Foligno during that OT playoff win.

I also do not wish for him to do poorly.  From reddiquette: Moderate based on quality, not opinion. Well written and interesting content can be worthwhile, even if you disagree with it.

The guy has 5 seasons of 20 goals or more. He scored 0.56 points per game in the CBJ sweater. If someone thinks having that kind of production as a mid-1st round pick is considered ""busting"" then they clearly don't know much about the sport.

BlueJackets,2yof4c,Milalwi,3,Wed Mar 11 14:01:32 2015 UTC,Great article. A lot of other teams fans want to talk about how bad we are after they beat us when we are down 6 key starters. It's been a rough season to watch happen but I think given the circumstances the team has stayed strong. Next season should be one to remember as long as we stay decently healthy through it all. Injuries will happen but no way we can possibly have 2 seasons go like this.
BlueJackets,2yof4c,justthetip751,6,Wed Mar 11 16:23:35 2015 UTC,no way we can possibly have 2 seasons go like this.   Do you want to be cursed by the hockey gods? Because this is how you get cursed by the hockey gods.

BlueJackets,2yoltr,flyerfanatic93,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:54:34 2015 UTC,"Answers.com:   The term comes from American sports. A team that has no hope of making the playoffs but still has to finish the season is said to be ""playing out the string."" The origin might be from the American frontier, where men would strike into the wilderness with a string of horses or mules, planning to ride each one until it was ""played out"" (too worn out to keep going), before switching to the next. If such a person was in a lost or hopeless position, he might decide to keep going until the entire string of animals was played out."

BlueJackets,2yn2vn,flyerfanatic93,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"Wennberg seems like he's struggling to adjust to the NHL level of play a bit more than Dano, but he'll definitely get there within the next few years. Both are definitely gonna be 50+ point producers though. Rychel is also very likely to join that category.  Getting McDavid would make this team an absolutely terrifying force in the coming years. I mean, you could say that about anybody, but even Pittsburgh took a couple years after drafting Crosby to start making a large impact. Jackets getting McDavid could see returns as early as next season. I mean, even this season had us performing very well when relatively healthy, just look at December."

BlueJackets,2ykf6s,Swabeky,4,Tue Mar 10 21:52:09 2015 UTC,The more I think and read into the Wiz situation I'm not that mad.  Reilly would be Amazing but if we don't sign Reilly Wiz was over 30 and had a decent cap hit.  We aren't going to be a SC contender next year (playoffs definitely) and frankly would never win a cup with him since I doubt we would of resigned him in two years anyways.  If this team can lock in all these young pieces that have shown flashes of brilliance then we are primed to seriously contend in 3 years.
BlueJackets,2ykf6s,HORSEtheGAME,6,Tue Mar 10 17:50:37 2015 UTC,Sure the trade makes sense but the return is pretty bad. Just because we can afford to trade him away doesn't mean we should do it for pennies!  That being said Reilly will be awesome.
BlueJackets,2ykf6s,Swabeky,2,Tue Mar 10 19:32:31 2015 UTC,Yea but Wiz listed ten teams he didn't want to be traded too and maybe this was all we could get after those ten teams were taken out of consideration.
BlueJackets,2ykf6s,HORSEtheGAME,2,Tue Mar 10 20:04:48 2015 UTC,Yeah you're probably right - it doesn't help that they went public with that info. That pretty much meant we had no bargaining power.
