When you come back from leading your party to abysmal failure in the last election, you have to offer something so people gain a little faith in you. Something to get excited about, like ""a new direction"".  Instead he seemed to announce his return, and then... he went on vacation or something."

ndp,3dmclj,MyNameIsEnzoAmore,0,Tue Jul 21 20:39:00 2015 UTC,With polls that good we might see a Liberal / Conservative Coalition party

ndp,3dkn3s,Eddie_Brock,2,Fri Jul 17 04:16:32 2015 UTC,Why? It's not like it's a secret we'll be having some paid staff on an election.

ndp,3d8ypw,PostsNDPStuff,2,Tue Jul 14 12:54:34 2015 UTC,What's the NDPs position on the TPP. I need to know they are against it before I'd support them.
ndp,3d8ypw,TaserTester,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:39:24 2015 UTC,"There is position is ""We will take a position when someone let's us read the agreement and make an informed decision on a position."""
ndp,3d9k8s,CanadainStrategist,4,Tue Jul 14 15:49:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say a visit to the north shore to secure Acadie-Bathurst is likely and depending how the polls go, he might go to Saint John as it has potential to swing orange federally. There are a few seats in NB where the NDP were in second place last election.   Tom is also on good terms with the provincial NDP leader, Dominic Cardy, so it is at least helpful that a large core of the provincial leadership are 'Tomists' and would be willing to organize a rally for him."
ndp,3d68s6,lurkerdontpost,12,Mon Jul 13 21:11:46 2015 UTC,"Damn. I'm generally opposed to attack ads, but it's hard to disapprove when every word of it is absolutely true."
ndp,3d68s6,steamwhistler,11,Mon Jul 13 23:20:42 2015 UTC,I'm with you on this one. But this is not really an attack ad. This is a wake up call.
ndp,3d68s6,NGeX,7,Mon Jul 13 23:26:24 2015 UTC,"Quoting from my comments in /r/Canada:   In common meaning, it's a negative ad, but it's not an attack ad. It's negative in that it says not-nice things about opponents, but attack ads are negative ads that make criticisms that are irrelevant or personal in nature, which this ad doesn't do.  ...  I don't think it's reasonable to draw the line at people who are running for office this election, especially since the Senate is not elected. The Conservatives made policy commitments about the people they would put in important positions, and the people they selected for those positions caused them to break that promise.  The Conservatives promised voters X. The voters did not get X. The ad uses Exhibits A through I to demonstrate that. It may be a negative ad, but it's not an attack ad.  ...  Advising the GG on appointments to the Senate is one of the primary functions of the PM."
ndp,3d68s6,isUsername,6,Mon Jul 13 23:41:58 2015 UTC,Technically correct. The best kind of correct. But to everyone else its an attack ad.
ndp,3d68s6,EskimoNorth,3,Tue Jul 14 13:35:16 2015 UTC,That's why I stay out of the strategy conversations ;)
ndp,3d68s6,isUsername,3,Tue Jul 14 16:45:53 2015 UTC,How does one get in on strategy conversations? I know I'll be looking for work soon.
ndp,3d68s6,EskimoNorth,3,Tue Jul 14 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"That level of strategy may be a bit above entry level but if you get involved in a campaign now and do a good job, you may be able to make some decisions locally."
ndp,3d68s6,EskimoNorth,4,Tue Jul 14 22:15:29 2015 UTC,Done and done already
ndp,3d68s6,killerrin,3,Tue Jul 14 22:17:44 2015 UTC,Thats a great ad. I think it could wonders if they can manage to get it out there; maybe even make other ones in its style where they go through everything else he has done terribly in his decade of power.
