I'm friends with a seasoned queen and I really believe that his work is not merely a matter of dressing up and looking feminine. He incorporates elements that make one reconsider what is attractive and why we are attracted to these things. To compare him to someone in a dragon costume is disingenuous.

The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the LGBT community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn, located in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.[2][3]  The cops were totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because everybody else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill.""[77] With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, ""Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon."" His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, ""All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously.""[78] The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu kick lines, and sang to the tune of Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay: ""We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear our hair in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair."

By banning drag queens from performing, they are trying to make a point about the exaggeration of feminism on male characters for the purpose of comical, dramatic, or satirical expressiveness pertaining to the controversies around their own sexuality-- not necessarily pertaining to any actual body transformation further than illusion.  While drag queens are an obvious part of these communities, their use of expression is not necessary to convey their sexuality, it actually wrongfully portrays the transformation of transgender-- intentionally.

Not what was necessary, or respectful, or professional, or courteous, or just; she just indulged her emotions and let loose.

In everyday speak, an unlawful detention occurs when a police officer detains you for an unreasonable amount of time without probable cause to do so. This “detention” does not necessarily mean an actual arrest. Unlawful detention may occur if an individual is detained for an unreasonable amount of time    The simple fact that the officers in question in this situation did not even check his picture ID before placing him under arrest is freaking huge. They had no probable cause to actually place him under arrest, they never even confirmed their actions before possible destroying a mans livelihood and reputation and were I on the job still I know I'd be sweating it that I didn't face serious action for that mistake.

offbeat,3dzvqj,Definitely_Working,0,Tue Jul 21 10:03:20 2015 UTC,"they didn't even get to that point. do you not understand that they didn't even get him out the door? the arrested him for a couple minutes until they quickly found out it was the wrong ryan. your being dumb, checking the I.D. would be done after they detain him anyway for a crime like that. think for more than a second about situations before you talk"

I can't guarantee that he would have gotten all the way downtown and into the booking room without one of the arresting officers looking at his license, but it is extraordinarily unlikely."
offbeat,3dzvqj,VodkaGimlet,2,Tue Jul 21 13:40:29 2015 UTC,"No doubt the armies of Internet lawyers will shortly appear but in most cases, arrest is a question of fact, not whether the cops followed the proper procedure to arrest. This stems from the nature of arrest in the English common law. What this means is that whether you are under arrest can only be answered by asking some other questions, e.g. Was the accused at personal liberty to travel elsewhere, was an arrest stated at any time, etc.   Generally in civil courts, arrest can be construed fairly liberally. In my jurisdiction there is a famous case where a man, when informed by a police officer that there were charges against him that he needed to answer, travelled with that police officer a considerable distance without any restraints by the police to the state capital--only to find out that the charges were improperly laid. He brought a suit for false imprisonment. The police answered that it was never stated that he was under arrest nor was he restrained so there was no arrest. The courts held that there was an arrest anyway."
offbeat,3dzvqj,holofernes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:01:23 2015 UTC,"The legal definition of ""arrest"" isn't really important. Regardless of whether this legally qualifies as an arrest, the media doesn't care about the arrest unless it's accompanied by transport, booking, and charges, which never even came close to happening here.  As someone who has been involved in several arrests and ""arrests,"" trust me--the experience of getting transported to a police station, fingerprinted, photographed, and put in a cell is much different than having to sit in a chair for a few minutes while a police officer ascertains your identity."
offbeat,3dzvqj,VodkaGimlet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:06:40 2015 UTC,He wasn't arrested.  . . . they canceled the arrest.    He was in cuffs which means that he was arrested. They can try and bullshit it all they want. That's how the law works. The Supreme Court has said so.
offbeat,3dzvqj,yourexgirlfriend,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:00 2015 UTC,"This would be tricky, because of finding of not guilty or innocent is either by a judge or jury, and the police may not agree with it.  Not guilty and innocent are also very different verdicts.  ""Innocent means that you did not commit the crime. Not Guilty means that there was not enough evidence to determine that you did commit the crime.""  While a full exoneration is appropriate in this case, they are not easy to do, so I would think they would be rare events, typically as part of a settlement with the police department."
offbeat,3dzvqj,WendyLRogers3,2,Tue Jul 21 13:11:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Arrested or not, he was implicated in something by no choice of his own.

Most of the criminal conviction source ""databases"" are not digitized. We hired people in specific counties to go to the courthouse and pull paper files individually.  Because background checks cost employers money, they don't go through the hassle of checking for arrests, only convictions. And they also only target areas where an applicant lives or has lived.

You read this everywhere on reddit and have for years so I've also been asking men I know if it has ever happened--and it never has to anyone we know. And it has never happened to my dad who takes his little blonde grandchildren as a very large Mexican man out to parks and hangs with them everywhere (all in urban areas). Zero problems.  He said when my nephew was throwing a tantrum he carried him out of Costco and was a little nervous carrying this blonde kid under his arm yelling his head off because he thought they might freak out on him--no one even looked up.   Maybe it's better if people believe this just in case there is someone with some strange child thing going on. So maybe I should not report that it isn't true.   The thing is that people do glance at someone askance on occasion. One day there was this one very odd looking guy doing some freaky exercises on a tree with super short shorts and the park is just a kids' park--like 100% kids--not a regular park. So I think people were like--uh what is he doing?  He was crouching down by the tree, then standing, then crouching. The thing that made me realize he was just some exercise fanatic was his incredible muscle definition.  But they didn't call the cops or anything.   I was always getting flashed as a kid--there were so many flashers when we were growing up. I'm not sure that flashing is even a thing these days.  So people really did stuff.

At the end of the day, it's all anecdotes. I saw it in life before I read about it here. Maybe part of the issue is that I know more than a few school teachers, and the crap they go through is pretty crazy. It is the sole reason there are so few male teachers.  Not that I'm really going to live my life differently as a result, especially since I don't have kids. I do think the ""all men are predators"" notion that seems to be floating around is not just peoples' collective imagination."
offbeat,3dwutj,Canadian_Infidel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:47:31 2015 UTC,"It's probably not the reason there are so few male teachers--teaching has been a female-dominated profession for many decades.   I'm sure if it did happen, I'd be bummed for whomever it happened to but it is presented on reddit as if it is some kind of barrier to male interaction with children instead of a very rare event--but anyone who knows men with children will tell you that they are all very welcome at parks, in schools, etc.   My brother in law is a teacher and he did have an issue--but it was not some molestation thing but a claim that he hit a kid as a form of discipline. It really sucked. The kid was lying and eventually he was cleared. However, it's still rare. We don't know anyone who has ever been accused of anything--though a teacher at a friend's school did have a recording device set up in the locker room of the school and was caught and put in jail.   Basically--it does suck when it happens that some man has some issue because he is under suspicion but it is uncommon enough that it should not drive anyone's behavior.   When I read it on reddit about 5 years ago or so I really started to try to find men who felt like this was their reality and I honestly cannot find any who do--and it isn't driving anyone's choices because there are scores of dads in the park, scores of young men as caretakers in my youngest child's preschool and in my oldest child's afterschool.   Obviously, women are just totally reflectively trusted with kids and men might be less so if they are strangers--but men aren't actively suspected--and dads are always with their children without moms--no one is going to question a man who is with his children as being somehow a kidnapper. That's something people on reddit always talk about but I simply do not understand where these people live or what the hell their experience could be--there are loads of dads alone with their kids out in the world."

IT'S NOT STRANGER DANGER YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IN A FOOD COURT, STATISTICALLY. IT'S YOUR OWN FAMILY AND CLOSE FAMILY FRIENDS. (and food poisoning!).  Your kid is more likely to be attacked by a wild animal than they are abducted or abused by that fearsome stranger.  Media, since the 80's have parents believing danger lurks around every corner and we overestimate the danger massively much to the detriment of society. Remember - they make money the more fear and horror they can show - and telling you about every <exciting> child abduction/abuse situation  skews our perceptions of reality dramatically.  Stop perpetuating fear that's not based on a reality that doesn't exist.  The dangers are 1000's of times lower than we treat them and the anxiety this puts all of us through - but especially the kids, is ludicrous.    http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/sunday-commentary/20100326-Joe-Keohane-The-crime-wave-762.ece"

I mean, if I was in the same situation I can imagine being scared for two small children alone at a mall and over exaggerating the story.   The fact is, people need to start actually talking to the kids more before getting the authorities involved. Theres too many stories of parents getting arrested for taking their kids to a park and going across the street for coffee. These concerned parents,instead of getting the cops involved, could easily just ask ""hey kid, where's your mom at? "" if the kid starts sobbing and says they don't know, call the cops.

Unless they all just walked up at the same time. Lastly if she had been shopping, or come back with some bags would the reaction be any different? ""Mother leaves 2yr old and 6yr old in mcdonalds while she goes shopping"" This would be on here for a different type of rage.
