chvrches,3e4way,junkmanserenade,3,Wed Jul 22 00:18:16 2015 UTC,i wish i would've thought of that
chvrches,3e4way,EddieTX,4,Wed Jul 22 01:47:43 2015 UTC,they did a short AMA thing on there earlier today.
chvrches,3e6aos,leniency,2,Wed Jul 22 07:48:14 2015 UTC,There was a post in /r/indieheads saying that most the recordings from pitchfork usually come out the first or second week of August. so probably just have to hold out a bit.

chvrches,3dy4wd,scottheisel,10,Mon Jul 20 14:16:29 2015 UTC,http://chvrch.es/shows/  Click on the Tickets link next to the show you're interested in for its ticketing page. Some link to Livenation/Ticketmaster event pages which will show what the prices are for those dates. The others that link to a SeeTickets page require a pre-sale code (which is unique to each pre-order) to see the prices.  New York's Summerstage show is $42.80 + a $2.50 fee which is applied per ticket.
chvrches,3dy4wd,brouseforaname,2,Mon Jul 20 15:08:48 2015 UTC,"So, when are tickets for general sale?"
chvrches,3dy4wd,TheRedComet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:13 2015 UTC,"Friday morning. Some start at 10 a.m. local time, others at noon. Check with your local venue."
chvrches,3dy4wd,brouseforaname,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"What goes under ""Title"" when you're buying the ticket? I'm really confused."
chvrches,3dy4wd,angelfromthecoast,8,Wed Jul 22 05:34:15 2015 UTC,"I had convinced myself that it'd be okay if I missed Pitchfork since they'd definitely come back to Chicago, but there's no Chicago date :(  Hopefully they add some more shows."
chvrches,3dy4wd,junkmanserenade,11,Mon Jul 20 14:27:46 2015 UTC,I'm assuming a lot of those gaps will be filled in.  There's no way they'll skip Chicago.
chvrches,3dy4wd,interface2x,4,Mon Jul 20 17:34:39 2015 UTC,"I really hope they come to Chicago, I saw them at Pitchfork, but I felt they were playing song after song without much talking to the crowd."
chvrches,3dy4wd,OfMonstersandMenFan,2,Mon Jul 20 23:41:55 2015 UTC,"Seriously? I've watched a number of shows on YouTube, and I felt like there was more crowd interaction at Pitchfork than in any of the ones I've watched. Definitely more interaction than when I saw them in person last year."
chvrches,3dy4wd,eastindywalrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:59:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, maybe it was just me, I felt like their performance went by really quick, but then again it was just 1 hour and I think the other artist shows I've been to are probably longer."
chvrches,3dy4wd,OfMonstersandMenFan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:31:29 2015 UTC,"The Pitchfork set was pretty representative of their performances.  It was probably slightly shorter than what they'll play this fall (as they'll have more new material out) and the light show is far better in their normal shows, but the energy and audience interaction was average for them."
chvrches,3dy4wd,interface2x,2,Tue Jul 21 04:38:51 2015 UTC,"I just hope that Chicago date doesn't land on October 6th, the night I have tickets to see Frank Turner. I've never seen him before and saw Chvrches at Lolla last year, but still, choosing between two of my favorites would be cruel."
chvrches,3dy4wd,junkmanserenade,2,Tue Jul 21 03:03:32 2015 UTC,Same here. Maybe they'll add one later
chvrches,3dy4wd,OHaiEric,5,Tue Jul 21 00:32:54 2015 UTC,October 8th! Woohoo! Does anyone know if the Fountain Ballroom/Masonic Temple in Detroit is a decent venue?
chvrches,3dy4wd,Zeuxon,4,Mon Jul 20 14:45:14 2015 UTC,"I haven't been there myself, but capacity is only about 1000 whereas the Royal Oak Music Theatre/The Fillmore have capacities close to 2000. So buy those presale tickets."
chvrches,3dy4wd,turtlesweater,4,Mon Jul 20 14:52:29 2015 UTC,"Saw Aziz Ansari do stand-up there over the winter; it's a pretty nice place, so this'll be an awesome show for them"
chvrches,3dy4wd,kmmac,2,Mon Jul 20 15:03:39 2015 UTC,"Tickets bought for this show. I am way too excited. Royal Oak was awesome, and I know this will be even better."
chvrches,3dy4wd,eastindywalrus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:08 2015 UTC,Are all of the tickets general admission? I don't want to be sitting.
chvrches,3dy4wd,Zeuxon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:48 2015 UTC,Looked like there was General Admission plus balcony. Not sure of the situation on the balcony.
chvrches,3dy4wd,eastindywalrus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:40:03 2015 UTC,Is GA always standing?
chvrches,3dy4wd,Zeuxon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:39:25 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking. In this situation, it definitely is. Ticketmaster lists General Admission for this show in Detroit as ""Standing Room Only."" http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/08004EEED7415287"

chvrches,3dy4wd,YoshiYogurt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:32:08 2015 UTC,"Make a weekend of it. Thursday and Friday classes? You're sick... cough cough. Drive down Thursday morning, grab a hotel. You could even drive back on Saturday and spend Sunday catching up on homework! Let's be honest, you deserve a break, though. UP life is tough, being so far away from... well, everything."
chvrches,3dy4wd,eastindywalrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:24 2015 UTC,"I don't even have class on thursday and I only have 3 hours on friday  My parent are against me driving over 4 hours for a concert. I have already seen them in royal oak but I want to see them all the time becasue CHVRCHES is one of my favorite bands.  I am probably going to drive to the minneapolis one saturday morning and drive back anyway without telling them. 6 hours there will be easy, but another 6 to come back will be terrible.  At least Lights is in detroit right smack dab in the middle of my thanksgiving break.  Didn't really think about the whole ""missing a ton of shows"" thing when I decided on a college. I'm going to miss Jethro Tull(another favorite) and I'm not sure when Ian anderson will retire, but he picks the worst dates for the US"
chvrches,3dy4wd,YoshiYogurt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:32:28 2015 UTC,This is confusing. The website says it is in the Fountain Ballroom of the Masonic Temple. It looks like Ticketmaster is selling tickets to the main room. There isn't a balcony in the Fountain Ballroom.
chvrches,3dy4wd,gunshipolitico,4,Mon Jul 20 17:07:10 2015 UTC,I just pre-ordered the album.. Will i get a pre-sale code?
chvrches,3dy4wd,sp33drAc3r1591,2,Mon Jul 20 15:06:34 2015 UTC,"You should be emailed a pre-sale code. Hope you get it quick, because the pre-sale periods ends on Wed!"
chvrches,3dy4wd,anarbitraryaccount,5,Mon Jul 20 15:54:19 2015 UTC,"Man, the things I would do for a standalone Boston date."
chvrches,3dy4wd,Lunchb0x812,3,Mon Jul 20 15:54:46 2015 UTC,"I just bought a NYC ticket, but probably would've gone for that as well. I just can't justify buying a Boston Calling ticket only to see Chvrches."
chvrches,3dy4wd,Barresi,4,Mon Jul 20 17:26:38 2015 UTC,Bought my Nashville ticket for $32.50. I am so excited to finally see them!
chvrches,3dy4wd,daddynotthebelt,4,Mon Jul 20 16:10:34 2015 UTC,Do you think they will add more cities later on? For 2016 perhaps?
chvrches,3dy4wd,coolzville,3,Mon Jul 20 17:15:25 2015 UTC,"I would be very surprised if they didn't. Last tour they added Europe/UK dates in December for early 2016, and then the following June they did a second leg US tour for the rest of 2016.   EDIT: there were some US dates announced along with the Europe/UK ones, mostly accompanying their performance at Coachella 2014."
chvrches,3dy4wd,Trololrus,4,Tue Jul 21 00:10:24 2015 UTC,i guess i shouldn't complain since they were just here on Friday at Pitchfork ...but some ppl weren't able to make it :(  :( lol oh well..hopefully they come next year in the spring to the Riv...love that venue!
chvrches,3dy4wd,pattycakezo,4,Mon Jul 20 17:21:52 2015 UTC,"Was hoping that Phoenix would get a visit on the first leg of their US tour, oh well :/ Fingers crossed that they stop by before I leave."
chvrches,3dy4wd,Trololrus,4,Mon Jul 20 17:53:22 2015 UTC,"Dang. I was really hoping they would come back to Miami. Oh well, looks like I'm gonna have to drive to St. Petersburg. It's about 3 hours away, but Chvrches is worth it."
chvrches,3dy4wd,periahdark,2,Mon Jul 20 14:55:04 2015 UTC,I'm rather hurt as a Brit that their new headlining tour doesn't start in their homeland.
chvrches,3dy4wd,JJKirby,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:03 2015 UTC,"I hope they come back to Scotland soon, would love to see them."
chvrches,3dy4wd,Paritys,2,Mon Jul 20 14:53:09 2015 UTC,I'm assuming that they'll do the UK tour during Nov-Dec and then the europe tour Jan-march. They've  done that before
chvrches,3dy4wd,opoipo,2,Mon Jul 20 17:58:21 2015 UTC,Here's hoping!
chvrches,3dy4wd,Paritys,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:00 2015 UTC,No show in Atlanta? :/  Maybe they can fit one in on October 29
chvrches,3dy4wd,VusterJones,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm here debating 3+ hours to Nashville. Typically I go to ATL which is just ~2 hours.
chvrches,3dy4wd,aves2k,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"Charlotte would be my best bet as its about 3 1/2 hours... but it's on  a weeknight. Next best is St Petersburg, but its 7 hours away on Halloween."
chvrches,3dy4wd,VusterJones,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:56 2015 UTC,Yeah! They did two shows in Atlanta last time. Weird we got left out. Maybe they will come back or add the date. Curious what venue they would be at because the venues seems to be getting larger (500-2000)
chvrches,3dy4wd,nickm717,3,Wed Jul 22 11:07:54 2015 UTC,"really wish there was a show in cleveland, don't know if i wanna drive all the way to columbus for a show"

chvrches,3dy4wd,Madcatz7,2,Mon Jul 20 22:08:33 2015 UTC,Really hoping they do an Austin date outside of Fun Fun Fun Fest - I'm not much of a festival-goer.
chvrches,3dy4wd,Nihiliste,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:17 2015 UTC,They'll probably do a late night show during FFF Fest. Just have to deal with a show that starts at 11.
chvrches,3dy4wd,libra989,2,Wed Jul 22 15:05:15 2015 UTC,"Bands always come up the West Coast all the way to Seattle, then turn around before going to Vancouver. Oh well, I saw them last year. Chvrches has been pretty good to us Canadians."
chvrches,3dy4wd,theEugoogalizer,3,Mon Jul 20 23:23:45 2015 UTC,"I foresee more extensive touring next year.  No way they'd neglect major US cities like Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix for long."
chvrches,3dy4wd,EddieTX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:38:11 2015 UTC,"Has anybody bought the presale tickets yet? Curious on the price of them. (More specifically the 10/8 show in Detroit, but any would work to get a feel on price)"
chvrches,3dy4wd,kmmac,2,Mon Jul 20 14:57:47 2015 UTC,http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/08004EEED7415287  Detroit tickets cost $39.80 after fees.

chvrches,3e0g95,Naikers,4,Tue Jul 21 00:25:01 2015 UTC,"On their website (chvrch.es) there's a digital download pre-order.  Haven't seen any FLAC source yet, the best for that may be getting the CD and ripping FLAC later."
chvrches,3e0g95,cardfan205,4,Tue Jul 21 00:40:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are any FLAC sources right now. You'll have to rip the CD. But you can pre-order 320kpbs CBR MP3s from Google Play Music.  If you want to get the pre-sale code for the concert, I think you have to order off Chvrches' site."
chvrches,3e0g95,periahdark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:01:14 2015 UTC,You could also preorder 256-ish kbps mp3s from amazonmp3. But you wouldn't get a ticket presale code that way.

chvrches,3dqdrh,SUP_CHUMP,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:08:34 2015 UTC,"I recorded the audio from the whole set from the pitchfork stream. I tried uploading Clearest Blue & Make Them Gold on to youtube but it would only accept Make Them Gold and blocked Clearest Blue worldwide. Yet people who were actually at Pitchfork fest were able to upload their videos of Clearest Blue. It's really weird that this is happening. Maybe Pitchfork plans on uploading the set, so they don't want anybody else uploading anything from the stream?  I hope so anyways because the audio quality would probably be better that way as well."
chvrches,3dqdrh,ReverieSoul,2,Sat Jul 18 18:39:13 2015 UTC,That would be great if Pitchfork puts the whole set on their channel.  Their Paris show is one of my fav vids.

chvrches,3dqdrh,appelso,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:27:41 2015 UTC,"I recorded only chvrches. It's not really that high quality.... Lolz but thanks. On the full show recording I was trying to figure out what the names were of the songs I had never heard and it recorded that....hope that's all right . I don't have anymore room on vimeo, i ll have to pay to upload more videos but I'll let you know when I get it up"
chvrches,3dqdrh,SUP_CHUMP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:00 2015 UTC,"Ok! Thanks! Actually, I meant the whole show from Chvrches. If it is in 720p like Clearest Blue, it could be great if you can share it. Maybe Pitchfork will upload soon as they did for their show in Paris. In any case, the most important was to get the live show of this new song thanks to you, as well as ""Make them gold"" and ""Leave a trace"" that we can find on youtube."
chvrches,3dp5qo,ReverieSoul,4,Sat Jul 18 02:51:51 2015 UTC,I love love love how catchy this song is! It's pretty much on par with The Mother We Share in that respect if you ask me.
chvrches,3dp5qo,NotTheMoussiah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:36:19 2015 UTC,"I hate myself for saying this. I initially really liked it, but now that I've been listening to it over and over again because I'm trying to transcribe the lyrics, and I just don't know anymore. I feel like there's something missing?  You know what I think it is?  It feels so opposite from anything on Bones and their other singles. Everything on bones was so atmospheric, this track doesn't have that. This track is too happy & familiar sounding. There's something throwing me off about the vocals too, but I can quite put my finger on it.  Leave A Trace & Clearest Blue are a lot more poppy than anything on Bones, but they still have this subtle atmosphere about them and are great tracks overall.  But I feel like there is something missing in the production & instrumentation of these 3 tracks. Everything feels too light and not dark and big enough like it did with the last record.  I suppose things are going to sound a lot different live vs. what they will sound like on the album but I feel like I'm having a musical life crisis over this :/"
chvrches,3dp5qo,EddieTX,3,Sat Jul 18 06:21:20 2015 UTC,"The band said they were going for a more stripped-down sound for this album, but I'd expect the record to sound more produced than the live cuts, particularly the vocal arrangements and effects, so I wouldn't write off the sound of the new songs just yet.   I think Make Them Gold is intended as a slab of pure dance-pop euphoria, with ""uplifting"" lyrics.  Agree it's kind of a jarring change from the feel of Bones.  Not sure yet if this represents the band at their best ... maybe best to reserve judgment until we hear the record.  BTW, this and Clearest Blue sound a lot like early Depeche Mode ... not that I'm complaining.  :-)"
chvrches,3dp5qo,omnomnam,0,Sat Jul 18 07:21:48 2015 UTC,"I certainly haven't written anything off, because they are one of my favorite bands. I have since listened to Clearest Blue again in a youtube video since making that comment and can hear some things that some of the other live recordings didn't exactly pick up in the background. I will reserve full judgement until EOE comes out though. I was just having some anxiety over this to be honest.  Bones and the few singles that came out afterward got me through a really dark time in my life. I feel really connected to that version of Chvrches. I'm just scared that I'll lose my emotional connection to their music with the new stuff, because of the contrast. The largeness/airiness, dark tone & complicatedness of the actual music is what made me connect with their music originally and made me realize that not all pop music is bad. Music is of a great importance to me mentally. It probably sounds silly, but it makes sense in my head."
chvrches,3dp5qo,YoshiYogurt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:13:53 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try my best to withhold final judgment 'til I hear the album version, but I definitely disliked this performance..."
chvrches,3dp5qo,livers,3,Sat Jul 18 08:03:00 2015 UTC,"Well of course it's going to be better, this is recorded horribly and it's probably her first time doing this one live."

chvrches,3do4f6,ReverieSoul,8,Fri Jul 17 21:22:51 2015 UTC,Leave A Trace sounded fantastic there.
chvrches,3do4f6,MattN92,7,Sat Jul 18 00:54:05 2015 UTC,"Not that they were bad before, but they've stepped up their live game, especially Lauren.   They tweeted earlier today about tour dates being announced soon, so hopefully these new skills carry over to the tour!"
chvrches,3do4f6,junkmanserenade,5,Sat Jul 18 00:48:24 2015 UTC,"This. So much this. A couple of great things I noticed:   Lauren is obviously having a ton of fun. I think she always was, but she really knows how to show it now, and that's going to make their live show even better!  Martin is as great as ever with Under the Tide, but Lauren is starting to steal the show back a little with her dance moves. I approve. In writing the new music, I think Iain sat down with Lauren and Martin and said ""okay guys, I need more awesome parts."" He's rocking out like a BAMF in the new stuff. I also approve of this. Speaking of dancing and rocking out - the new stuff is definitely feeling more upbeat. TBOWYB had a dark attraction that we all love, but I know Every Open Eye is going to be so much fun to just crank up and dance your ass off to. Case in point: Look at Lauren up there having a ton of fun dancing. You know that comes from rehearsing the new stuff."
chvrches,3do4f6,eastindywalrus,3,Sat Jul 18 01:22:15 2015 UTC,"It's striking how Lauren's stage presence has changed from CHVRCHES 1.0 ... she seems MUCH more confident and commanding in this performance.  In the past, she often demurely turned and faced Iain during instrumental breaks, but now we see her stepping to the front of the stage, striking a superhero pose, and pumping the mic with gusto.  Her vocals are noticeably stronger, too, with more than a hint of aggression in tunes like Gun.  It's ... it's ... oh hell I'll say it.  It's awesome."
chvrches,3do4f6,EddieTX,8,Sat Jul 18 07:02:50 2015 UTC,Best show I've seen online since ACL. That beachball part was amazing. Not that I needed anymore reasons to be obsessed with this band they go and play this show. Ahhhhhhhh cloud nine duders.

chvrches,3do4f6,red_280,5,Sat Jul 18 01:07:20 2015 UTC,There were unfortunately a lot of nasty comments as well. I just ignored talking to people while the set was going on though but I was secretly really pissed off by some of the stuff people were saying.
chvrches,3do4f6,_teslaTrooper,3,Sat Jul 18 03:09:35 2015 UTC,Rule 1 of internet streams: the chat is garbage and possibly even worse than youtube comments.   You'll know this if you've ever watched a game stream. Unless it's a small (<1000 viewers) stream just disable it and rest assured you didn't miss anything.

chvrches,3do4f6,Daymnusic,2,Sat Jul 18 01:31:08 2015 UTC,The Clearest Blue is my current favorite off this new album so far. So much energy! Can't wait for the tour!
chvrches,3do4f6,eastindywalrus,3,Sat Jul 18 07:41:00 2015 UTC,"Decent gig, new songs sound good.  Lauren a little off pitch sometimes, probably a lil rusty, but seems assertive and assured.  Videography OK, not as good as ACL (but I'm biased).  Audio mix nice.    Clearest Blue and Make Them Gold sound straight outta the 80s.  Not that it's a bad thing.  And, was it just me or was the arrangement a bit different on Recover?  I think it would be cool to hear reworked versions of older songs.  Anyway, good job from the band as usual.    Edit for point of trivia:  the album title comes from the lyrics of Clearest Blue."
chvrches,3do4f6,minusheadup,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:37:54 2015 UTC,I definitely noticed something different about Recover. It sounded good!

But don't forget, those listed on stub hub now aren't even in the hands of the original purchaser yet but that hasn't stopped scalpers from listing early.

chvrches,3dht0b,ReverieSoul,5,Fri Jul 17 01:48:55 2015 UTC,"I love it so much. I feel like Every Open Eye will have a nice contrast with Bones but still have those darker than your average pop song type of lyrics, which Lauren is so great at writing. Bones was dark, very big and bright as far as production goes but it seems Every Open Eye will be a little more lighter, open & crisp. And judging by Leave A Trace the album seems a bit more accessible to mainstream pop lovers.   This could be Chvrches year."
chvrches,3dht0b,Murphy-115,2,Thu Jul 16 14:03:26 2015 UTC,"Quite good, not as catchy as I'd expect but the lyrics are great and I can see the rest of the album having great lyrical content. Looking forward to hearing some better quality videos of the new songs being played live"
chvrches,3dht0b,danyul91,6,Thu Jul 16 18:42:05 2015 UTC,"It clicked with me immediately. I thought the chorus was typical Chvrches stuff, but not in a bad way, hooks are a big part of their appeal. Lauren's vocals are saccharine as ever (those highs), but it sits right and doesn't feel excessive. Very excited for the rest of the album."

chvrches,3dht0b,rotmoset,2,Thu Jul 16 20:29:07 2015 UTC,"I posted this in another thread, but on my first listen I don't like it. It's not catchy like Bones, the lyrics are terrible (IMO). I know this is 100% opinion and most in this sub won't agree with me - but this feels like a step back from Bones.   Or maybe it's just too damn early, I have a headache and not enough coffee in me. Maybe."

I hope they deviate away enough from the last album to make this album stand on it's own."
chvrches,3dj35h,Sup6969,7,Thu Jul 16 17:59:20 2015 UTC,I certainly hope so. I'm now fully expecting Every Open Eye to be pop porn.

In the lower res version at a quick glance, and also when a few tiles were revealed here and there, I thought there were hands/fingers mixed in with the flowers. Some of those petals look very much like fingers. I don't know if I like it more or less now that I know it's just flowers, but... there's that."
chvrches,3di5j1,prof_leopold_stotch,2,Thu Jul 16 14:31:00 2015 UTC,Apparently they are big fans of Power Corruption and Lies.
chvrches,3dkzal,Sir_Knee_Grow,8,Fri Jul 17 02:58:34 2015 UTC,"Nope. I think that it's great because they haven't switched their style up, but with her singing in a bigger range and sounding more emotional, it is a much ""bigger"" song, while still sounding like CHVRCHES."
chvrches,3dkzal,Isthisgoodenough69,4,Fri Jul 17 06:28:20 2015 UTC,"Actually I think she is showing a bit more range here. She sounds great, and it's got me thinking this new album is going to be really good."
chvrches,3dkzal,Yetee,2,Fri Jul 17 15:49:18 2015 UTC,"If by ""lower timbre"" you mean the more delicate, breathy, somewhat, um, youthful sound on songs like Mother, then I can see your point.  The new vox are stronger and forceful, at least from what we've heard so far.  We'll see if any of the other new songs feature the more familiar sound.  I'd personally love to hear more in the style of the Arctic Monkeys cover."
chvrches,3dkzal,EddieTX,2,Sat Jul 18 22:03:12 2015 UTC,"More range, more confidence, and more emotion. I LOVE the newness. Looking back at Bones she sounds very robotic and delicate. I love change and evolution from a band. It's exciting."
chvrches,3dkzal,bagomagik,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:01:31 2015 UTC,"Well on the first verse she's singing pretty low I thought! Maybe it's just the dramatic shift between the low verses and crazy high chorus? Either way, I love both. :)"

chvrches,3dgr3e,EddieTX,3,Thu Jul 16 04:26:12 2015 UTC,"Oooo can't wait to hear it, i love Get Away."
chvrches,3dgr3e,EddieTX,5,Thu Jul 16 06:14:37 2015 UTC,"Unlike Get Away, which I thought a bit lacking in the lyric department, this one has Lauren doing a post-mortem on a failed relationship, taking a strong stand and sounding very confident.  Love it.  The production quality has been taken to another level.  Bones wasn't bad, of course, but hiring the world's best mixing and mastering engineers does help.  Fantastic sound."
chvrches,3dgr3e,red_280,6,Thu Jul 16 07:03:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely a lot cleaner and sleeker sounding. Bones was mostly overdriven saw waves throughout, so the biggest danger was they'd just rehash that sound. Sounds like they've avoided that without completely abandoning it."
chvrches,3dgr3e,EddieTX,3,Thu Jul 16 07:10:03 2015 UTC,Is this the song they're doing on the radio tomorrow?
chvrches,3dgr3e,JadedDarkness,3,Thu Jul 16 07:12:38 2015 UTC,Yes.
chvrches,3dgr3e,ReverieSoul,6,Thu Jul 16 07:14:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely what I wanted from them. Similar sounds, yet different enough that it stands on its own. Great track, can NOT wait for the album."

chvrches,3dgr3e,EddieTX,7,Thu Jul 16 06:11:25 2015 UTC,I really dig the shit out of this song.
chvrches,3dgr3e,leniency,6,Thu Jul 16 06:34:12 2015 UTC,"It's already been removed from itunes. Here's the amazon link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011ECYQC0/ref=dm_ws_sp_ps_dp  Be aware that the deluxe edition with the three extra songs will almost certainly be itunes exclusive, though."
chvrches,3dgr3e,ReverieSoul,5,Thu Jul 16 06:55:40 2015 UTC,"Weird.  It's still on Amazon right now.  Edit: Amazon also has the Deluxe Version album listed, with 14 tracks.  Not available yet, of course."

chvrches,3dgr3e,ReverieSoul,3,Thu Jul 16 07:03:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you, it's only available in the US though :-( not on our page..."
chvrches,3dgr3e,EddieTX,2,Thu Jul 16 07:06:55 2015 UTC,It's actually still up on Itunes if you use the actual Itunes app and go through the store.
chvrches,3dgr3e,ReverieSoul,3,Thu Jul 16 07:26:55 2015 UTC,You mean the desktop application? It's not there.
chvrches,3dgr3e,EddieTX,3,Thu Jul 16 07:34:35 2015 UTC,"That's odd, perhaps it's still there for me because I already purchased it?  There seems to be something weird going on surrounding everything last night/this morning.   The info about the album, the release on Itunes & the band haven't said a thing about any of it on social media. Something's not sitting well with me :/   I feel bad now for updating the wiki pages, should I delete the EOE page and info about it on the main Chvrches page?"
chvrches,3dgr3e,ReverieSoul,5,Thu Jul 16 07:43:23 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry about it.  No point in trying to keep things secret once they go online.  Multiple sources have already reported it all.
chvrches,3dgr3e,droidroid,3,Thu Jul 16 07:46:45 2015 UTC,"I know, I just don't want to contribute to anything negative. I feel like sort of a bad fan now. Hopefully they'll clear things up tomorrow. I just find it strange that Lauren was supposed to go on Sirius radio tomorrow and debut a new single but instead we got it early. Maybe Itunes just really fucked up or something, I'm still not even sure how the album info got leaked last night either. So many bizarre things."
chvrches,3dgr3e,ReverieSoul,4,Thu Jul 16 07:54:14 2015 UTC,"This is the way things go these days.  No worries, bud."
chvrches,3dgr3e,cow_goes_moo,2,Thu Jul 16 08:04:54 2015 UTC,Okay so I just went back and deleted the EOE wiki page out of respect for the band. I'm sure they will update it themselves when they are ready to.
chvrches,3dgr3e,RobsterFresh,3,Thu Jul 16 08:01:57 2015 UTC,You really didn't need to do that
chvrches,3dgr3e,8bitsince86,3,Thu Jul 16 09:10:59 2015 UTC,"I know but I realized the shitstorm the band probably had to go through. I felt just as bad as the leakers :/   I get paranoid and anxious over the silliest things. I'm sure somebody will fix the page, seeing as of 18 minutes ago the band just officially announced the album and probably not by choice either."
chvrches,3dgr3e,interface2x,9,Thu Jul 16 09:24:41 2015 UTC,"Well, that was a quick purchase...  As for 'Leave a Trace,' it's not as instantly catchy as 'Mother' but I also can't smiling while listening to it. Very different than their previous work but getting me very excited for the rest of the album."
chvrches,3dgr3e,JJKirby,6,Thu Jul 16 03:50:49 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I love CHVRCHES so much. I'm getting this as soon as possible.  Edit: i just heard it and it sounds great! Completely agree when you say it isn't as catchy as Mother We Share but thats completely fine. I'm really loving it, i can't wait for album 2!"

chvrches,3dgr3e,pounro,2,Thu Jul 16 15:53:20 2015 UTC,Removed from both iTunes and Amazon now.  Neither link takes you anywhere anymore.  EDIT: It's back up on both now!
chvrches,3dgr3e,allnaturalflavor,2,Thu Jul 16 13:09:36 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone! Love this band so so much and the new song made me have ASMR for the first time, that must mean something right?!   Anyway, regarding the lyrics: ""I gave up on time, just like you said you would"" - what? Anyone care to offer me something to help me understand that line?"
chvrches,3dgr3e,red_280,3,Sat Jul 18 18:34:04 2015 UTC,Is there any link that doesn't require iTunes?
chvrches,3dgr3e,EddieTX,3,Thu Jul 16 06:40:44 2015 UTC,I think they played it live but i didnt hear it. I havent bought it yet so i'm dying of hype.
chvrches,3dgr3e,red_280,3,Thu Jul 16 06:42:45 2015 UTC,I saw the newest live videos already but the sound quality is really bad and I'd like to hear the proper recording
chvrches,3dgiii,ReverieSoul,7,Thu Jul 16 02:20:39 2015 UTC,"I had to stop halfway through. I couldn't ruin it with that quality. If its that awesome a song, with that shitty quality audio, then I'm fucking stoked. I'll just wait to hear the whole thing. Is that the song they're releasing tomorrow?"
chvrches,3dgiii,jambispot,4,Thu Jul 16 02:45:35 2015 UTC,Audio quality :(
chvrches,3dgiii,CoonDude,2,Thu Jul 16 02:32:30 2015 UTC,I know :(   It's still awesomesauce from what I can hear though :D   Can't wait to hear a proper version tomorrrow!!!
chvrches,3dgiii,EddieTX,6,Thu Jul 16 02:37:40 2015 UTC,"Hoping someone else recorded the new songs ... this one has the worst audio I've ever heard.  When will people learn not to bother using their phones for this?    It was good to see the band back onstage, tho.  Couple new keyboards, new backdrop, and Lauren ... well, you know.  ;-)"
chvrches,3dgiii,cpjones_swag,4,Thu Jul 16 03:03:46 2015 UTC,She's really starting to come into her own on stage now. It's great to see!

chvrches,3dgiii,garrettastic,5,Thu Jul 16 02:35:06 2015 UTC,The song we're supposed to be getting tomorrow isn't this one though. It's a track called Leave a Trace.
chvrches,3dgiii,periahdark,2,Thu Jul 16 02:46:47 2015 UTC,"Aw. Well I'm sure they'll play it again at other venues, if there aren't any good shots from this spot."

chvrches,3de2y0,DrTchocky,11,Thu Jul 16 00:36:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think the album itself will be released in a week. The name of the album, the album cover and the released date will probably be announced in a week though. There's no way the only marketing plan they would have would be cryptic images & 5 shows leading up to the release. Although it would be awesome for a release this soon, it just doesn't make sense as far as marketing goes."
chvrches,3de2y0,ReverieSoul,4,Thu Jul 16 00:59:40 2015 UTC,"My apologies--you're right. I mean ""album announcement"". We might be able to download a single then, but I'm positive we'll basically have all the details then"
chvrches,3de2y0,DrTchocky,4,Wed Jul 15 16:09:28 2015 UTC,"Well if they debut a new song tonight at Bluesfest (as well as other shows after that) I bet they might just release a single!  It's a good time to be a Chvrches fan _^   I like the cryptic photo thingies, It's almost like viral marketing just for the fans who pay close attention to their social media pages. It also adds to the hype and excitement of everything!"

chvrches,3cvnfn,Warningsign42,13,Sat Jul 11 03:54:46 2015 UTC,My guess is that they are going to a meeting with Glassnote Records & Virgin Records to talk about marketing for the new album and signing papers and such. This correlates with tweets from the band about leaving Glasgow and being in London which is where Glassnote Records UK division & Virgin Records UK division is located. From there they may then travel to the US to figure out stuff with the American label divisions and then travel on over to Canada to play the Ottawa Bluesfest!   Just a guess though!
chvrches,3cvnfn,ReverieSoul,5,Sat Jul 11 11:47:17 2015 UTC,Release some new damn songs before I piss meself.
chvrches,3cvnfn,red_280,7,Sun Jul 12 06:02:02 2015 UTC,I'd be on the lookout Wednesday or Thursday on this sub and on Youtube!  Chvrches 2015 tour starts Wednesday at the Ottawa Bluesfest!  I'm gonna guess they'll debut one or a few of the new songs then & you just know somebody will record it/them and put it up on Youtube!
chvrches,3cvnfn,ReverieSoul,2,Sun Jul 12 06:24:14 2015 UTC,"Was hoping to see a livestream from one of the upcoming fests, but haven't heard about any yet.  Seeing a vid someone made on their phone isn't my favorite way to be introduced to a new song.  :-)"
chvrches,3cvnfn,EddieTX,2,Sun Jul 12 19:42:26 2015 UTC,"I know right!  But it's better than nothing until we have a proper release. I'm guessing Pitchfork will be recording the fest so we might get some pretty good footage of something new after Chvrches plays their set on Friday, hopefully anyways. They recorded the halloween show last year so maybe we can hold out some hope!"

chvrches,3bc9mv,LesPaul22,9,Sun Jun 28 05:16:47 2015 UTC,Not yet :(  I'm predicting they will debut one of the new songs when they play their first show of the year on July 15th! (Especially seeing as they tweeted that they are rehearsing to play the new songs live)  I assume they'll release said song as a single shortly after & then the album will probably drop a few months later.

chvrches,371nqy,nomorerope,5,Sun May 24 06:49:44 2015 UTC,Lungs is the best.  I love Martin singing the chorus at the end and Lauren does backup.  People are definitely right that he is not a great singer but seriously it still blends in so well with their sound.  and of course the guitar riff. Lauren said it was her favorite song on the album too so she has good taste ;)

chvrches,371nqy,T_Snake451,5,Sun May 24 02:23:41 2015 UTC,Night Sky is great. I think it's one of those songs that would be nice to listen to while cruising around at night. Might try it soon

chvrches,36x2jr,ReverieSoul,3,Fri May 22 20:50:12 2015 UTC,Man I really hope they release something soon. I'll even take a shit quality 5 second bit of a song. Chvrches pls
chvrches,36x2jr,OHaiEric,3,Sat May 23 04:00:15 2015 UTC,I read an interview with Lauren where they asked if they would be debuting any new songs for their first show in July. Lauren said they haven't gotten to the rehearsal stages for any of the new material yet but they are looking to expand their setlist!  So it seems like a slight possibility that we could hear new stuff in a a few months!  My ears crave new Chvrches music so bad!!

chvrches,365udr,ramblotas,28,Sat May 16 12:56:41 2015 UTC,"Woot! my time to shine! Glasgow has a hell of a lot of synthpop bands to offer  First: Prides (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcZNEo9ZKtQ) They're incredible and also from Glasgow. If you like Chvrch. songs that feature Martin you will love these guys. I gotta say I prefer them to CHVRCHES. They're going to hit it big soon and I can't wait  Second: Kloë (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv-inXna9y4) she is another synthpop musician from glasgow. Insanely talented and rising quickly. Quite similar to CHV. but I prefer her voice to lauren's (Kloë's voice is like silk). Keep an eye on this one, she is touring with Ryn Weaver (another crazy talented female artist that is rising crazy fast).   Third: on that note, Ryn Weaver (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM_CrCFRw-k) she isn't all to similar but whatever, her music is good and her debut album is going to hit soon. Pretty sure that its going to push her into stardom. Reminds me of how Haim used to be (haha).  Fourth: Purity Ring (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqw4wo8vdY8) a little on the trap-y or dub step-y side so you might now like that. They're killer live, seriously talented. Really famous though so you probably already know them.   Fifth: Sky Ferreira (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqGhSR0z1fw), kind of a cross between all the artists that I linked to before. She is great, hasn't released music in a bit but yeah very talented, synthpop-y and has a nice voice. Great songwriting skills too.  Sixth: Muse, they're pretty famous but their new single ""Dead Inside"" has some definite CHVRCHES vibes goin on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTcJWhmdzpg  Lastly: WhoMadeWho, they're great. Synthpop all guy band, nice sound, great live performance and stage presence. Pretty polarising though, they're kind of a ""love them or hate them"" band. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1YezTZp6Vc"
chvrches,365udr,bandslikechvrches,7,Sat May 16 13:15:14 2015 UTC,"+1 for Sky Ferreira. I guess everyone assumes she's some crappy pop singer because I never see her mentioned on Reddit... but seriously, she's exactly what I look for when it comes indie-popish type artists."

chvrches,365udr,davis12321,2,Sat May 16 13:57:40 2015 UTC,"For me, there's:   Charlie XCX. You might find her whole image a bit trashy and obnoxious but some of her songs are undeniably catchy. Future Islands. They really go for a new wave sound that is really retro - not in the updated, modernised sound that CHVRCHES do, but music that genuinely sounds like it could've been made in 1985. Still, the lead singer has a fascinating voice and presence and again their songs are quite catchy. Broods. Brother and sister from NZ, worked with the same producer as Lorde. A lot of similarities between the two, but they have a bit more of a textured, organic sound. Grimes. Pretty experimental and atmospheric, melds together a lot of different electronic styles. Again, some of her stuff is weirdly catchy. MØ. Another artist who I've rarely seen mentioned on Reddit. Singer-songwriter from Denmark, her music could be described as a cross between Lorde and Purity Ring. Lots of attitude and swagger in her sound."
chvrches,365udr,red_280,1 point,Sat May 16 15:26:25 2015 UTC,"Charlie is an interesting case. I was a fan of her music prior to her involvement with Azalea and before her first album, when her music was pretty UK-centric. I feel like she has changed a lot, in good and bad ways. The album is catchy but it just feels like she sold out a little (that ""I don't want to go to school, I just want to break the rules"" song is absolutely awful)."

Their self titled album is very 80s inspired synth pop and the closest thing I've found yet to Chvrches sound.   Check out Shiny Toy Guns early stuff as well, you might like them and as somebody else suggested you should check out M83 (their album Hurry Up Were Dreaming is a freaking synthpop/indie pop masterpiece)  As far as bands/artists with awesome female vocals other than Chvrches,you should check out these:  Metric (Indie Rock but also incorporates synth in their sound. Their whole discography is worth a listen. One of my top favorite bands)  Reverie Sound Revue (Dream Pop with lots of synthyness, check out their EP which is better than their album IMO)  Braids (Dream Pop/Art Pop lots of electronic & chill vibes. One of my top favorite bands)   Yeah Yeah Yeahs  (Rock/Art Punk. Their latest album Mosquito is more synthy then their other albums. But their other albums have way more punch. Karen O's vocals will hit you in the soul!)  Beach House (Dream Pop. Very chill with very unique female vocals!)  Carmen Townsend (Straight up Rock. She's a local musician to my city. Her voice is a freaking powerhouse. She's actually opened for Heart before. She needs more recognition)"

You guys might not necessarily agree but eh. Give these guys a try. The recommendations are in no particular order:  Odesza. I linked you to their album opener. Honestly, these guys are one of the greatest electronic music acts to come out in the last few years. Their debut album was sublime; I've pretty much been following them for the past 2-3 years now and I have nothing but praise for them. Check them out.  M83 Great band; they're decently popular. You've probably heard Midnight City by them on the radio or what not.   Broken Bells Can't recommend them enough. It's Danger Mouse and the vocalist from the Shins; they make a great combo, have two albums out and they're both great!  Royksopp. This band changed my life. As over the top as that sounds, it's true; I was primarily an avid classic rock / alternative music aficionado that dismissed electronic music as being repetitive and boring. This band's album (Junior) opened my eyes to a whole world of music that I had been ignoring. Had I never gotten into this band; I probably wouldn't have a taste for Chvrches.  Yuma X These guys just debuted their first song and they're awesome.  Made in Heights Just check them out. I absolutely love their style  Wet They even toured with chvrches about 2 years ago. They're pretty cool  Have fun listening to these peeps. I would definitely recommend going through all of their music and not just the ones I linked to. I tried to make sure that I didn't repeat any band that was already in this thread but sorry if i did. Have fun!"

From their interviews they have made it very clear that they will take their time and not let others opinions influence how they sound or how they work.

chvrches,34er2t,brendo91,3,Fri May 1 03:46:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this will be the first single. They do seem to be taking their time though, which is great. They've been in and out of the studio for about 5 months and I'm sure they had been thinking album stuff even before that. Bones came out 2 years ago, so I don't really see how they are rushing the new album as people are saying. Like you said I would be surprised if they mess this album up. I believe in this band and they have yet to release anything even sub par. They know what they're doing!"

chvrches,32qoh7,Gre3nArr0w,4,Thu Apr 16 20:48:06 2015 UTC,IMO a second album is where a band really proves if they are good or not. Beginners luck is real and I worry that CHVRCHES is going to ruin themselves by putting out there next album too quick and not making quality music. I hope I'm wrong I really do but they've only been in the studio for 4 months and have been moving way too quickly. Again this is my opinion.
chvrches,32qoh7,ReverieSoul,6,Thu Apr 16 04:36:57 2015 UTC,"Musicians rarely go into the studio with empty heads. I'm sure they have been thinking creatively since Bones was released. They probably already had some things in mind way before going into the recording process. Musicians are always thinking of new rifts or melodies or lyrics or instrumentation in their minds on a daily basis whether it's conscious or subconscious and keep note of those thoughts. I wouldn't worry too much, plus they still have to mix everything, get it mastered by whoever and then wait for their label to approve everything and then wait again for their label to do all the pre marketing and marketing stuff. I'd say it's going to be a while until we actually see the new album. My guess is that we might not even see it this year and if we do maybe not until the fall."
chvrches,32qoh7,meowmeowman,5,Thu Apr 16 05:11:02 2015 UTC,"A studio is where you go to record, not write an entire album. I'm sure they wrote the foundation of most of it while on the road."
chvrches,32qoh7,red_280,3,Thu Apr 16 21:38:23 2015 UTC,"Most likely when they start touring the festival circuit, they'll incorporate dead air and the drive song into their show. Release a new single, release an EP with dead air, get away, plus maybe a few songs to see what the reaction is. Start hyping the album art the end of this year for a new tour. Drop a few more singles in December and spring, released new cd early 2016. They're going to tour hard again."
chvrches,32qoh7,Bunyungtung,3,Thu Apr 16 10:58:15 2015 UTC,"Depeche Mode were pumping new albums on an annual basis when they were first starting off, and they were continually improving with each release. The amount of band a band spends on recording an album is hardly a reflection of how good the final product will be."

This music is getting kinda repetitive. minute five: ""okay, there is no way that will play through the whole video.  It'll change"" minute nine:  ""HOLY FUCK IT'S STILL PLAYING""   Look.

chvrches,2za8cc,jamesgaa,2,Tue Mar 17 00:56:04 2015 UTC,Some of the rarer ones are stupidly expensive (like north of 100-150€ and up for the original recover EP) check discogs.
chvrches,2za8cc,OutsideOwl,2,Tue Mar 17 06:48:48 2015 UTC,"eBay and Discogs were my only two sources for everything you see, save for the frames themselves. The 2 standard release LP vinyls (Gun, Lies) come up for sale every once in awhile. I think I paid ~$20 + shipping from the U.K. to the U.S. for each of those. Recover was ~$40 or so, and I only paid that much for a low number, you can get it now for ~$20. The ""bootleg"" of BOWYB was close to $50. I still would love to get 3 more vinyls: the 10"" original Mother We Share, the original release of Recover (not the white sleeve Record Store Day one), and the red vinyl BOWYB... but I don't want to pay the crazy prizes for those right now."

This was my first festival too, and I made it a must for me to go there and see CHVRCHES because they were on near where I live in the North East earlier in 2014, but I found out way too late and missed them.

chvrches,2whov0,keirjohnharry,4,Fri Feb 20 00:09:20 2015 UTC,"As a huge fan of both artists, I can confirm that this is the best thing since sliced bread.    I'd been waiting for this release for over a year.  And the video just makes it even more awesome (pretty sure the cube/visuals are a teaser, having to do with either Eric Prydz' upcoming album or tour).  Love the original.  Love the remix.  The video is of the radio edit of the remix, if you want the full remix, go here  There was also an alternate version of the remix that is not ever getting a release, so if you're interested in that, you can download it free here"

chvrches,2wf72m,carson3000,3,Thu Feb 19 14:24:06 2015 UTC,I actually did that originally but it sounded totally off because the vocals and the music were different pitches.
chvrches,2wf72m,EddieTX,1 point,Thu Feb 19 14:46:44 2015 UTC,"Whoever that vocalist is, she's pretty good!  :-)  Seriously, this sounds better than the Dead Air single, which is actually pitched up a step from the version they did in concert.  Made Lauren sound really weird, I thought."
chvrches,2wf72m,opoipo,1 point,Fri Feb 20 06:00:37 2015 UTC,Wow I really prefer this to the original.
chvrches,2wf72m,KoneBone,3,Thu Feb 19 12:24:07 2015 UTC,"I was really just messing around with a music editor and thought ""Hmm Lauren has a really high pitch voice, I wonder what she would sound like pitched down further"" this was the result and I thought it sounded pretty great. Usually when you pitch down tracks like this with a female vocalist it can tend to sound either ridiculous or masculine, but Lauren's voice is so high and feminine that it totally works."

They're are however unofficial instrumental's for a few of them but they were not done by CHVRCHES themselves but are pretty damn accurate if you ask me.

chvrches,2vhkxu,ReverieSoul,2,Wed Feb 11 01:55:07 2015 UTC,100% agree with you. When introducing people to chvrches I'll show them this video first.
chvrches,2vhkxu,emurf15,4,Wed Feb 11 02:34:56 2015 UTC,Lauren's vocals in this are so much more intense in this version. She also comes off as more confident in this video. She seems to let her nerves get the best of her while performing usually I've noticed and she seemed more hyped up in this video. The crowd also looked a lot smaller maybe that had something to do with it.
chvrches,2vhkxu,EddieTX,5,Wed Feb 11 04:17:39 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure this is from the first ever CHVRCHES gig.  The audio was dubbed from a studio demo.  I dig it!
chvrches,2vhkxu,zeile33,1 point,Wed Feb 11 06:14:55 2015 UTC,It's a pretty hot vid too

chvrches,2veeg2,brendo91,2,Tue Feb 10 08:28:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, one of the best Chvrches covers I've heard."
chvrches,2veeg2,CIGrules,0,Tue Feb 10 15:28:31 2015 UTC,This is heartless and boring. It sounds like they specifically set out to soundtrack a coffee shop.
chvrches,2veeg2,Kameron808,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:07:09 2015 UTC,This is such a strange cover to me. At first it reminds me of bands like The Pixies & The Smashing Pumpkins and then it falls into U2 mixed with pop punk. It's one of the better covers out there but It's just not my thing (I do love the actual Pixies though)
chvrches,2veeg2,ReverieSoul,1 point,Wed Feb 11 04:24:22 2015 UTC,"This ain't bad at all.  Nice production quality, good vocals, pretty cool arrangement.  The guitars are a little too hair-metal for my tastes, but I'm a nerd.  :-)  Good work!"

chvrches,2u0136,Good4Josh2,2,Wed Jan 28 23:26:05 2015 UTC,A radio rip isn't studio quality :(
chvrches,2u0136,popnwave,0,Thu Jan 29 19:43:38 2015 UTC,By studio quality it means that it's the actual track and not a live recording of it from a concert.  This is the only version of the song online without audience noise.

chvrches,2tfao4,clausy,12,Fri Jan 23 17:59:42 2015 UTC,"It sounds like Martin is saying the band is taking a more minimalist approach this time.  If that means production in the style of their ""acoustic"" live performances (including the Arctic Monkeys tune), I'm all for that, as long as there remain some moments of massive synth-euphoria.  :-)"
chvrches,2tfao4,EddieTX,2,Fri Jan 23 22:16:09 2015 UTC,"So I guess there might be more songs like Broken Bones, but not as dark?"
chvrches,2tfao4,brendo91,7,Fri Jan 23 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"Not sure if Broken Bones is what they have in mind -- I think Iain has said they want to keep the danceable grooves, but maybe with more stripped-down arrangements.  Think Billie Jean or When Doves Cry, to name two examples of what Martin may be referencing.    For fans of Lauren's vocals, this is good news -- fewer instruments means more room for her pipes."
chvrches,2tfao4,EddieTX,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:51:52 2015 UTC,That sounds awesome.

The Range at 1:42? Yeah! That must be the best mini-montage of Martin dance moves to date. I approve."

chvrches,2sfihi,farsited,3,Wed Jan 14 19:33:39 2015 UTC,"Google says its ""feeling capable"", but doesn't ""feel incapable"" make more sense for a song called Tether? ""Incapable"" also makes more sense in relation to the other lyrics. I think there's only 3 people that could convince me for sure...."
chvrches,2sfihi,not_a_banana,2,Wed Jan 14 20:57:36 2015 UTC,I know!! it works both ways feeling capable might mean shes breaking off the tether and feeling incapable means she can't let go T___T. Either ways it makes perfect sense and makes me cry everytiem
chvrches,2sfihi,Hantra,10,Wed Jan 14 21:14:16 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell this is a break up song. its a shitty relationship but there is some kinda emotional? tether holding it together. the realization of ""hey I don't need this shit, I can live without it"" AKA I'm feeling capable of seeing the end /saying its over. then the tether breaks and the tempo changes (explodes?) from slow and melancholy to fast and chaotic.  so that's my opinion on why ""feeling capable"" makes more sense than ""feel incapable"""
chvrches,2sfihi,The_Thane_Of_Cawdor,3,Wed Jan 14 21:21:49 2015 UTC,I'm not convinced it's a break up song. I'm leaning toward addiction. But great art is like that. Can have many meanings.

They very well could put out an album before Coachella and just have no plans to tour at that time, or are touring Europe or something. Also I don't know if this is true for Coachella specifically but generally music festivals try to limit the number of acts performing in back to back years."
chvrches,2rjekg,ChainedFactorial,4,Tue Jan 6 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Coachella doesn't allow back-to-back repeats of artists. And they already finished TBOWYB tour, so they're not doing any shows."

I still suspect it'll come out early 2016.  EDIT:Upon further thought, this doesn't even confirm that the album won't be ready by Coachella.

chvrches,2rbzm8,brendo91,2,Fri Jan 9 04:43:32 2015 UTC,Trust - Fits into the darkwave and synthpop genres. What makes him unique is that he regularly switches between falsetto and baritone vocal ranges in his songs.    Are We Arc?  Candy Walls
chvrches,2rbzm8,Good4Josh2,2,Mon Jan 5 16:33:32 2015 UTC,I realize that Deadmau5 is another genre but this song is very similar to Science/Visions: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SSac980qlI&hd=1  It was an earlier version of the track; the final/official/released version sounds very different.
chvrches,2rbzm8,EddieTX,2,Sun Jan 4 23:23:31 2015 UTC,"The intro to S/V reminds me of this: Donna Summer - I Feel Love ... probably not exactly what you're looking for, but the band is undoubtedly influenced by dance tracks like this."

I'm fine with that -- I'd rather wait a year or more for a mind-blowing release than a couple months for something meh, which would be the surest path to oblivion for the band. Most people (and record labels) have no patience for sophomore slumps these days.    I think the band is smart enough to realize all this, though.  They certainly seem to know what they're doing.

chvrches,2qskku,captaincannibal,8,Tue Dec 30 06:41:06 2014 UTC,"They have studio recordings of a few covers, like Tightrope and It's Not Right But It's Okay which are on the 2-CD versions of Bones, but I'm right with you on Do I Wanna Know -- not only should they record that one, but I'd love to hear more of that style on future releases.  Anyone else agree that it's one their best performances?  Nailed nailed nailed it, and apparently all in one take.    Oh, man.  I just noticed that the video of this song has over 2.5 million views.  I guess we're not the only ones who like it.  In case you weren't aware, in addition to that Triple J video on YouTube there's another rendition of the song on the BBC's site: CHVRCHES on BBC Radio Scotland"
chvrches,2qskku,EddieTX,3,Tue Dec 30 07:45:32 2014 UTC,"Some people have pointed that the tripple J take is clearly edited and could suggest multiple takes, not that it really bothers me personally.   I can understand that they probably don't want to be known for their covers and there could be copyright laws in place that would cut into the profit for recording a cover of a band like Artic Monkeys who are active and popular."
chvrches,2qskku,The_Thane_Of_Cawdor,2,Tue Dec 30 14:40:31 2014 UTC,"Well, it's easy to edit a single take by cutting and pasting the video from one chorus to another, for example, but in any case it's a great performance.  Remarkable that it has more views than most of the stuff on the band's own channel.  The band would have to pay royalties on released cover songs, but if they're popular it's still a good move, even if there's not much money to be made selling music these days.  Anyway, their original material is good enough to avoid the ""cover band"" label, I'd say."
chvrches,2qskku,EddieTX,3,Tue Dec 30 20:27:01 2014 UTC,"Don't think so. In fact, at some point they stopped making new covers altogether because they didn't want to be known as a cover band.  I believe the radio station for whom they did the Arctic Monkeys cover did release that performance on a compilation cd."

I hope the best for them.   It'll really be a test of their enduring talent as artists. I generally consider myself a fan of synthpop/electropop music - especially from the 80s - but its really only Depeche Mode that I feel that managed to transcend their genre whilst still closely embracing it. They started off with Speak & Spell, which was just cheesy bubblegum pop - good for what it was, but not my cup of tea. But with every album, their sound gradually diversified, and they were talented enough to never put out a truly terrible album. Then around the late 80s to early 90s, they really started to get comfortable with going beyond synths and brought in guitars and organic instruments, but as with all the other changes they made they were still definitely fundamentally a synth band (and its the era that they made their best stuff).  That basically represents my idealised progression for a 'synth' band like Chvrches. I can only hope they don't take the dreaded MGMT route, but it'd be a shame if they just stuck to a formula and only chose to make a few safe adjustments along the way. Basically, it'd just be great if they fundamentally stuck to making pop music - but felt free to really go beyond what they've already done... to go as far as they could with their music (but not too far?)"
chvrches,2nxr5w,red_280,6,Mon Dec 1 16:12:35 2014 UTC,"i get the hesitance, but what exactly do you propose the alternative is? that they keep touring BOWYB til they drive it into the ground or just stop making music altogether?   of course following up a well received album is a risk, but that's the industry, and it isn't something new.  also i disagree with your haim and phantogram examples. the latter is already five years removed from their first full album (not exactly chvrches' position) and the former had a far more accessible debut album that is not only more popular but way closer to mainstream pop rock."
chvrches,2nxr5w,ps_,6,Mon Dec 1 20:24:57 2014 UTC,"Excellent post!  I think the band has enough talent and smarts to avoid the sophomore slump.  They don't seem to be capable of making a bad song; the only question is what style they want to emphasize, whether it be the anthemic pop of the singles, the dance euphoria of Gun, the emotional catharsis of Tether, the cinematic drama of S/V or ZVVL, the slow burn of the Arctic Monkeys cover, or something new.  I'd like to see some of all these on the next LP.  Whatever they come up with, I suspect it'll be killer.  Nobody's telling them what to do, they're not ones to chase trends, and they certainly know what they're doing when it comes to writing and producing material.  Their grounded attitude and level-headedness will serve them well as they embark on the new project and campaign.  Should be a fun ride."
chvrches,2nxr5w,EddieTX,2,Mon Dec 1 18:08:42 2014 UTC,I agree with everything but Haim. They're staying for good. I saw them recently and they just captured the crowd perfectly (much better stage presence even than CHVRCHES). They're diversifying by collating with rappers and EDM guys and they're following has inflated really really quickly.
chvrches,2nxr5w,opoipo,3,Mon Dec 1 20:44:49 2014 UTC,"I think HAIM doing that is just more proof they're going to be a flash in the pan pop artist. If you're music cant exist on it's own without you doing gimmicky crap with Juicy J or DJ Git Bizzy or whoever, then it wasn't really all that to begin with.   I honestly think they're just doing that for a bit of fun. A few diverse collaborations shouldn't be seen as a concrete indication of where their sound will be going. The reason I like HAIM so much is that they make quality, throwback music that appeases the critics and music snobs but don't take themselves so seriously that they'd actively limit their own musical palette.  In my view, those questionable hip-hop/club collaborations will probably continue but I highly doubt it's something that would ever seriously factor into their main studio releases."
chvrches,2nxr5w,red_280,0,Mon Dec 1 17:53:00 2014 UTC,"I understand what you're saying completely. The obvious counterargument would be that CHVRCHES also uses a hell of a lot of gimmicks (Saw waves everywhere, vocals playing with overdubbed -1oct vocals, maschine-manipulated vocal samples etc...) They're just a different kind of gimmick"
chvrches,2nxr5w,opoipo,1 point,Mon Dec 1 17:59:21 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't say those things you listed for CHVRCHES are gimmicks, that's just how they write songs..."
chvrches,2nxr5w,tuneorg,-2,Mon Dec 1 20:15:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but if they don't move beyond that singular kind of sound then that's when it starts to become a gimmick."
chvrches,2nxr5w,red_280,2,Mon Dec 1 18:05:22 2014 UTC,"Neon Indian is still very good all around...only thing I disagree with  Washed Out, still amazing"
chvrches,2nxr5w,YoshiYogurt,3,Mon Dec 1 18:46:49 2014 UTC,"I definitely see what you're say. I'm not too worried myself though. They've said it themselves, the album may take 4 months or 4 years. They'll work it until it's just how they want it to be. I think the three of them have a really solid grasp on what makes their music special to their audience. It's a total collaboration between them and I think that helps keep things in check.  Plus, their latest singles have been fantastic in my opinion. ""Dead Air"" and ""Get Away"" sound just as great as TBoWYB and that's really what solidified my confidence in their next album. They've kept that '80s electro-pop sort of sound while keeping it feeling current. It's especially the fact that those were songs made for significantly large collaborations (The Hunger Games Soundtrack and the Drive Soundtrack remix) and yet they still kept their own sound without compromising.  Along with that, you can tell from their interviews that they are dead set against letting anything get to their heads. They're going to make the music they want to make and when it all fizzles out someday, so be it. I can't see them changing their ways to fit in with current pop music or something like that.   Another point I have in this long, rambling statement is that they know that an album is more important to put together than just a bunch of singles. They've said it before that they love the ebb and flow of vinyl (with a distinct A and B side, not having the popular singles all at the front and then the rest thrown on the tail end, etc.) and want that same feeling in their own albums.  I said a lot of junk, but basically I think they'll do well. They've been writing on the road and interacting with their fans the whole way through. I trust they know what to make and how to make it."
chvrches,2nxr5w,WhaleyVlogs,1 point,Mon Dec 1 20:17:06 2014 UTC,"their follow up to oracular spectacular is basically a snoozefest   Are we listening to the same album? I thought Congratulations was a really solid effort, and ""Siberian Breaks"" is one of MGMT's best songs. I think the problem here is that you're looking at the band the wrong way - MGMT is a lot more of a psych rock band than a synthpop band."
chvrches,2nxr5w,OmniscientRogue,3,Mon Dec 1 18:54:46 2014 UTC,"This makes me so excited. I'm so curious to see what they do with their sound and how it evolves. Their last couple releases (Dead Air) are pretty CHVRCHES, so let's see what happens now.  Any clue how long this process takes? I'm already sitting on the edge of my seat."
chvrches,2nxr5w,frozen-creek,1 point,Tue Dec 2 00:55:16 2014 UTC,They seem pretty quick. I assume their label will push for a june/july release. They've got two songs in the bag so I think its doable.

chvrches,2nxr5w,frozen-creek,2,Mon Dec 1 17:54:03 2014 UTC,I know these might sound negative but does anyone ever wonder how long Chvrches is going to be around? I feel like they're really pushing themselves with almost always being on tour. Obviously I'm excited for more new music but I'm worried about just how long they'll be around for.. especially since I first saw them at smaller less crowded venues and now they're blowing up to be quite large. Just hope they can meet the demand..   /u/areyoufraid said it the best

chvrches,2nes7w,EddieTX,9,Wed Nov 26 00:22:10 2014 UTC,Woah. I know every male (and female) here adores Lauren but continuously posting pictures of her in this subreddit isn't for the best. Diversity of content people...
chvrches,2nes7w,ps_,7,Wed Nov 26 01:00:33 2014 UTC,"I'm all for diversity of content, but it's not uncommon to see lots of photos of the band's singer in any dedicated forum, particularly when they're on tour and constantly being photographed.  This band has emphasized the visual element of their concerts, and like it or not, the visual focal point is their lead singer, who happens to be quite photogenic.  Totally normal stuff here, I think.  That being said, I wouldn't mind seeing more discussions of the music, lyrics, instrumentation, concert reviews, etc.  The steady flow of new pics and vids will soon dry up, and it would be a shame to have this forum dry up too."
chvrches,2nes7w,insectlife,3,Wed Nov 26 05:13:11 2014 UTC,"i totally agree with you. and here's the thing about 'content diversity,' if you think there should be more talk of this or that, then post something new. i'm not sure how someone can complain about lack of originality when only one person has been submitting stuff of late. i don't think this place has ever been faulted for excessive moderation, so anybody is capable of starting a new discussion or whatnot.  that being said, i don't think photographs are far from normal for a band sub, but we as a group are going to have to pull our stuff together to keep this place active soon, because once this tour finishes (finally), we are going to have a wait between albums. and if it comes down to choosing between photographs or inactivity (or worse, videos of people covering chvrches' songs), i'm going to choose the former. but i hope it isn't just a choice between the two."

It's just that before this week I'd never seen 4/5 of the top 5 posts pictures of the singer, mostly from the same poster (Decent pics tbf). Prior to this I was always impressed by how the board seemed to collectively avoid such activity.  As a pubic forum people can add, upvote, downvote what they want, so I'm by no means complaining. Just commenting what I noticed, and seeing whether or not the sub agrees."

chvrches,2nes7w,MarryMe_StVincent,6,Wed Nov 26 15:41:14 2014 UTC,"I think what the poster is saying is that turning this sub into just being devoted to pictures of Lauren kind of defeats the purpose of the sub.

chvrches,2nes7w,DeadWoodPete,1 point,Wed Nov 26 04:18:59 2014 UTC,"Right, there are plenty of good-looking artists, but without good material and talent they won't attract many fans. It's the combination of all three members that make this band successful.  I'm Captain Obvious, I know, but there are those who aren't aware how essential Iain and Martin are -- without them, there would be no CHVRCHES, and Lauren would still be toiling in obscurity."

chvrches,2myfry,0x537,1 point,Wed Nov 26 00:35:28 2014 UTC,"Wish I could but I only was able to stumble upon the vocal-less Lungs from another youtuber who I think got the official instrumental track, which is why it's so clean, and the Taylor backing track is pretty light in Blank Space so it was easy to isolate, whereas unless I find the isolated Lungs vocals it's going to be hard to separate cause at times the vocals meld with the synth so it's not as easy as saying take out the bass, take out the really high parts. Also I'm doing this all in garageband xD so yeah."

Certainly better than most could. It felt like that act was much less rehearsed and sort of late notice anyways. They really wouldn't have any time to get together and practice that more than a few times prior so it's understandable there were some hiccups. Other than that I thought it was pretty solid.  I really enjoyed their performance of ""The Mother We Share"" though. It was definitely a better representation of what Lauren (and the band as a whole) can do.

chvrches,2kci1e,carlosaguilera,2,Sun Oct 26 04:44:34 2014 UTC,"Does not start with full energy but improves as the set progresses, don't you think?"
chvrches,2kci1e,willionare,3,Sun Oct 26 04:51:50 2014 UTC,"Definitely, I was up in front for that show and it felt like they came in a little slow but by the end it was just an amazing atmosphere. I wish I could go back to that."
chvrches,2kci1e,EddieTX,3,Sun Oct 26 19:56:37 2014 UTC,"Agree, they really hit their stride by the time Recover came around, didn't they?  Under the Tide is another highlight ... Martin was a force of nature there.  Hoping we'll get to see the ACL Fest set again sometime.  That one was pretty great as well, and included Dead Air."
chvrches,2kci1e,pattycakezo,2,Sun Oct 26 20:27:20 2014 UTC,"Aw man i watched this from the hill across the stage...they were good...so glad they came back, got to watch them up close ;)"

chvrches,2k3w3a,Fantasysage,11,Thu Oct 23 16:27:32 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I really didn't mind the vocals on the album version of this track, but these ""single version"" vocals sound pretty off... they're just like distorted and slowed down and ""brought out"" enough to sound weird."
chvrches,2k3w3a,25dollars,4,Thu Oct 23 16:56:39 2014 UTC,"I like both versions of Under The Tide; one sounds like a live performance while the other sounds like a studio version. Give it a couple listens, it sounds initially weird in the beginning because we've all listened to the TBOWYB version, so not liking it in the beginning is not unusual at all."
chvrches,2k3w3a,djrealtalk,4,Thu Oct 23 17:47:51 2014 UTC,"I like the vocal mix, I just don't like the way he slurrs his words in the verses like he does when doing it live. Also don't understand why the main synth is so quiet on the chorus."
chvrches,2k3w3a,Brewster-Rooster,4,Thu Oct 23 18:10:26 2014 UTC,"Funnily enough, I'm in the exact opposite camp. After listening to the single version, I can't even listen to the album version anymore. The vocals just sound washed out with that heavy reverb and multitracked lead vocals.  The single version just feels much more natural to me."
chvrches,2k3w3a,CIGrules,5,Thu Oct 23 17:51:03 2014 UTC,"This. So much this.  I didn't care too much for the album version until the saw the energy that Martin had in the live performances, so I appreciated the original version a bit more. My biggest complaint with the live performances, however, was that his vocals often seemed strained and/or out-of-tune. This single version flows so much better, helping capture some of that energy that was absent in the album version but present in the live performances. There is indeed a much better balance between music and vocals, something that was desperately needed after the album version."
chvrches,2k3w3a,eastindywalrus,1 point,Sat Oct 25 15:37:24 2014 UTC,Agreed.  Was one of my least favorite tracks on the album until I saw them live. The dude rocked it on stage.
chvrches,2k3w3a,Tullamore_Who,3,Sat Jan 17 18:41:24 2015 UTC,Without the reverb and vocal effects it makes you notice even more how Groundskeeper Willie his accent sounds.
chvrches,2k3w3a,red_280,1 point,Thu Oct 23 18:30:44 2014 UTC,They also aren't in key a lot of the time. I'm really surprised that this came this far. The original sounded 10x better.
chvrches,2k3w3a,opoipo,6,Thu Oct 23 17:09:45 2014 UTC,"Nice to see Dok take the spotlight, but it could have used more Iain and Lauren."
chvrches,2k3w3a,jrredwing,6,Thu Oct 23 22:55:51 2014 UTC,"I like this mix of the song, but then I generally prefer the vox up front.  The vid is fun ... yet another sci-fi theme, eh?  Do these ideas come from the band, or the video director?  Hmm."
chvrches,2k3w3a,EddieTX,3,Thu Oct 23 19:08:29 2014 UTC,"I wasn't too sure what to think of this version when it first came out, but after a couple listen I accepted that they're capturing the energy of this song when Martin sings it live. After all, they chose this song to be a single because of how much attention it gets at shows. Martin's vocals don't sound terrible live nor in this version of the song."
chvrches,2k3w3a,SaintTriangleFace,5,Thu Oct 23 17:53:52 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I don't like the music video, That could be said for a lot of the videos though they all have this anime feel to it and that is too nerdy for my liking."
chvrches,2k3w3a,Gre3nArr0w,2,Thu Oct 23 21:34:03 2014 UTC,"the live performance of this song kicks ass! this version (single?) seems to have slightly clearer vocals than the album, took me a second to adjust, but not bad.  as is often the case, the youtube comments are pretty ridiculous, you'd think that martin was some backup singer stepping over lauren."
chvrches,2k3w3a,ps_,2,Sat Oct 25 02:55:31 2014 UTC,"Why didn't they use the album version? Much better IMO, but this is still good nonetheless, just sounds live."
chvrches,2k3w3a,pounro,4,Thu Oct 23 18:06:43 2014 UTC,The vocals are atrocious. Now THIS is my least favourite track of there's by a long way.
chvrches,2k3w3a,droidroid,3,Thu Oct 23 16:32:06 2014 UTC,The mix is definitely different. I have heard this track live a few times and it is much better.
chvrches,2k3w3a,droidroid,1 point,Thu Oct 23 16:33:39 2014 UTC,"I definitely agree this song is much better live but this version, which I assume is the 'single' version is pretty bad."
chvrches,2k3w3a,bferret,5,Thu Oct 23 16:44:49 2014 UTC,How do you agree that this song is much better live but still like/not dislike the album version more than this? The single version is much much closer to how it is performed live.
chvrches,2k3w3a,droidroid,2,Thu Oct 23 22:38:12 2014 UTC,"The vocals on this version just sound strange. I don't like them. It's different live. A different experience also. I can't really explain totally but I just really dislike this vocal take, particularly when the album version was fine as it is."
chvrches,2k3w3a,smiffy124,0,Thu Oct 23 23:06:39 2014 UTC,I don't understand that just because you don't like this song less than the others you are being down voted. Do we have to like every single song that they put out no matter what?
chvrches,2k3w3a,droidroid,0,Fri Oct 24 00:03:25 2014 UTC,I guess it is the second song this week I've been negative about.

chvrches,2juxev,FSR2007,3,Tue Oct 21 15:20:28 2014 UTC,Ooooo yea!
chvrches,2jt5rf,ScottFromScotland,19,Mon Oct 20 18:48:43 2014 UTC,"I actually like it a lot. Definitely different from their other stuff, but I'm liking it."
chvrches,2jt5rf,PbPePPer72,14,Mon Oct 20 22:01:46 2014 UTC,"It took a few listens, but I definitely like it. That chorus is great, I totally see it being on the Drive soundtrack (great movie BTW)."
chvrches,2jt5rf,junkmanserenade,8,Mon Oct 20 22:35:14 2014 UTC,Agreed. This fits Drive so fucking well.
chvrches,2jt5rf,Barresi,7,Tue Oct 21 06:18:06 2014 UTC,"It's got a really great chorus, but I really wish they didn't put so many effects on Lauren's voice in the verses. This isn't close to their best stuff, but it's still a good song"
chvrches,2jt5rf,MEMgrizzlies7,9,Mon Oct 20 23:09:33 2014 UTC,"They should pull a full early 90s Depeche Mode and go pseudo alt-rock with live drums and guitar, maybe start bringing out some strings/orchestration and throw in some experimental sounds while they're at it. It'd breathe a lot of new life into their music."
chvrches,2jt5rf,red_280,5,Mon Oct 20 19:38:36 2014 UTC,I'm with you brother
chvrches,2jt5rf,leniency,1 point,Mon Oct 20 20:06:24 2014 UTC,god yes i've always thought their live show would be amazing with live drums
chvrches,2jt5rf,jaaaared,4,Tue Oct 21 15:21:31 2014 UTC,I like it. It's different enough from TBOWYB that it works on it's own. Would I like whole album with this sound? No. But it's still a great single.
chvrches,2jt5rf,JadedDarkness,3,Mon Oct 20 23:41:23 2014 UTC,"I really like this, despite it's mixed reviews. Certainly not their worst song."
chvrches,2jt5rf,pounro,10,Wed Oct 22 15:45:52 2014 UTC,Not saying it's bad but this is definitely my least favourite Chvrches song so far.
chvrches,2jt5rf,droidroid,2,Mon Oct 20 19:16:37 2014 UTC,"Even compared to ""You caught the light"" and ""Under the tide""?"
chvrches,2jt5rf,Tomvtv,15,Tue Oct 21 02:22:54 2014 UTC,I wasn't that big on Under the Tide until I heard it live. That song kicks ass.
chvrches,2jt5rf,Ellie-okay,7,Tue Oct 21 04:08:25 2014 UTC,"Same, Marty definitely delivers at shows."
chvrches,2jt5rf,shanew21,2,Tue Oct 21 08:03:08 2014 UTC,Under the Tide is a great song. Agree about You Caught the Light though.
chvrches,2jt5rf,droidroid,0,Tue Oct 21 02:52:41 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, yes."
chvrches,2jt5rf,leniency,0,Tue Oct 21 06:31:37 2014 UTC,same
chvrches,2jt5rf,YoshiYogurt,2,Mon Oct 20 20:05:49 2014 UTC,"Not sure how I feel about the vocal effects. They don't take priority and are in the background which I REALLY like, although I am not a fan of them as a whole.   This song is good enough that I hope it gets on the next album. +1 do like"
chvrches,2jt5rf,thismaynothelp,4,Tue Oct 21 22:51:50 2014 UTC,"It's pretty good, except for that hideously annoying intro. I don't understand the appeal of that at all."
chvrches,2jt5rf,coffeefirsttho,4,Tue Oct 21 02:13:42 2014 UTC,"I'm a bit underwhelmed, and it pains me to say that"
chvrches,2jt5rf,opoipo,1 point,Mon Oct 20 19:04:51 2014 UTC,"Agreed. IMO I think that next year we'll be saying that CHVRCHES peaked both musically and in terms of sales with bones. I just don't see this song catching on. It sounds like Lorde, but its Lorde done worse than Lorde. If I wanted to listen to Lorde I would listen to Lorde. There aren't really any bands that sounded like CHVRCHES did on Bones, but what we've heard of Get Away and Richard Pryor just sounds like half baked attempts at branching out rather than innovating within the genre that they're a leader of.  Edit: also jesus christ those drum samples feel like they are raping my ear drums. Mixing/mastering in this track is so strange with Lauren's voice and the constant side chained synth in the back with the drum fills in the front.  edit: TY for the down votes. I'm expressing my opinion. The down vote button isn't a disagree button."
chvrches,2jt5rf,ps_,2,Mon Oct 20 19:56:24 2014 UTC,well you hope at some point they stop this non-stop touring and are able to commit 100% of their energy to their next album.
chvrches,2jt5rf,red_280,1 point,Tue Oct 21 02:28:36 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't judge the mixing/mastering too harshly. It just sounds like some radio rip, one that would probably get a bit more work if it was actually on a record."
chvrches,2jt5rf,red_280,1 point,Mon Oct 20 20:05:13 2014 UTC,"They put it on their youtube channel as it was airing on the radio, it's not a radio rip.  Also on their soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/chvrches/chvrches-get-away/s-jjMXr"
chvrches,2jt5rf,bferret,2,Mon Oct 20 20:10:13 2014 UTC,"I guess not, but its clear it isn't as polished as it usually might be, would hardly cast final judgement on something like that."
chvrches,2jt5rf,ISNT_A_NOVELTY,2,Mon Oct 20 20:32:50 2014 UTC,This isn't bad but is definitely lacking the energy of their other songs. A little too sample heavy and some of the lyrics are a bit... awkwardly delivered?  Hopefully the next release is more like Richard Pryor and less like this.
chvrches,2jt5rf,djsquilz,6,Mon Oct 20 19:47:09 2014 UTC,Its supposed to be in the style of the soundtrack from Drive. I doubt it will be on the album - its just a one-off thing that Radio 1 is doing.
chvrches,2jt5rf,YoshiYogurt,1 point,Tue Oct 21 00:29:01 2014 UTC,"It's just, so close to being good imo. The melodies are there, same with the drums, but it seems like they turned the wrong channels up when mixing. Turn down the toms, bring up the drums, and a put in a nice lead synth arpeggio that follows the chord progression during the chorus and it would be perfect."
chvrches,2jt5rf,goth_bacon,1 point,Tue Oct 21 00:01:42 2014 UTC,"definitely agree about the mixing, it's weird"
chvrches,2jt5rf,jaaaared,1 point,Tue Oct 21 22:52:36 2014 UTC,I think it would've been better if the vocal effects were applied to the whole song.

chvrches,2jkp3t,goth_bacon,13,Sat Oct 18 02:16:00 2014 UTC,Seems more like a Lorde (ya ya ya) song to me.
chvrches,2jkp3t,MarryMe_StVincent,3,Sat Oct 18 02:52:47 2014 UTC,Only in as much that it's reverb heavy synthpop.
chvrches,2jkp3t,foofly,6,Sat Oct 18 13:10:44 2014 UTC,"Kind of in the downtempo synth way. These lyrics are garbage, though."

chvrches,2jan3h,dynomikeyy,3,Wed Oct 15 06:13:09 2014 UTC,"It's alright lol. I had a somewhat similar situation happen to me after I saw them at the House of Blues in Orlando. There's this area off to the side of the HoB store that artists are known to be at after a show and I told my friends we should stick around in case they come out. But they didn't believe me and they were my ride, so we left. As soon as I got home I saw pictures of people with Chvrches in that exact area getting signatures and photos with them... Anyway, back to your situation: Unfortunately Chvrches just wrapped up their US tour so they probably won't be coming back too soon. However it seems like they enjoy performing festivals so I'm almost positive they'll be back in the US next year. And if that isn't enough, Iain confirmed a second album (but it might take a while) so they'll have to tour again!"

If that's even possible. , Energy in the crowd was good from start to end. Not everyone knew every word which was kinda lame but I can hardly talk today from screaming last night. Night Sky and Gun stand out to me from the show. They played a new song, that was really sick. I think its called The Ritz. I got a short clip of it on my phone and keep playing it over and over. Lauren was funny when she said ""This is a new song"", and then after it was over said ""Hmmm prob shouldn't of said that, Martin is giving me a death stare...oh well"". And laughed it off.    Overall I would rate it a 10. I fucking love Chvrches and had high expectations going in from friends who saw them last year when they came, and they did not disappoint at all.  Everyone in my group gave the same rating when were talking later after the show. Once in a lifetime experience to see my favorite band crush it 5 min down the road from my place. Sad that they will not be back in the states for quite a while. Lauren said that show last night was the last small venue performance for that album in the states pretty much for good."

During the interview, the MC asked if anyone in the audience was a musician. Since I play guitar and write my own music, I raised my hand. All three members talked to me giving advice on how to be successful as a musician (Iain's advice was ""Don't do it!""). It was the coolest thing to ever happen to me."

The first time my girlfriend and I got to a show several hours early, and they ended up coming out of the venue to say high to the beginning of the line as well as hand out popsicles for us. They stayed for about 15-20 min signing things and taking pictures.   The second time we decided to wait by their trailer with a few other fans after the show. They came out within about 30 min after the show and took pictures/did autographs.   Both times Iain was not present for anything. But on the bright side I have a vinyl, tickets and a poster signed by Martin and Lauren as well as a few pictures. They seemed happy do it both times, but were understandably exhausted the second time after the show."

Met Martin after their Forum show in March again because he was going out after the gig and he recognised me, didn't see Iain at all and Lauren went straight into a car after the show. I think they've got quite a tight schedule so I understand if they don't fancy hanging about the venue after another show, but the few times I did talk to them, they've been genuinely great. Haven't seen them live since the end of March and I need to get my fix again! haha"

Then after the show, we went across the street to a bar to use the bathroom, came back to walk around the venue and they were in the back by their tour bus taking pics and signing stuff..they signed my setlist i snagged earlier that nite :D ..They are super nice and sweet and Awesome LIVE!"

chvrches,2hc184,Zeuxon,2,Wed Sep 24 14:48:07 2014 UTC,I've seen a picture of the poster floating about on their Facebook page. Hoping they have tees as well this time.
chvrches,2hc184,richardcook,1 point,Wed Sep 24 17:01:54 2014 UTC,"I bought a tee and buttons at a concert, and they have posters on their website."
chvrches,2hc184,hereliesjacob,1 point,Wed Sep 24 17:46:22 2014 UTC,"Same stuff as their online store, with the addition of a pretty rad tour poster. Might I add that tees are 20 bucks cash, versus the 25 + shipping online. Great deal. Picked up two shirts this weekend."
chvrches,2hc184,OstranderN7,1 point,Wed Sep 24 19:38:54 2014 UTC,"Awesome, is the tour poster for their tour they're on right now? Because I know they're currently selling their Europe tour poster."
chvrches,2hc184,OstranderN7,2,Wed Sep 24 19:58:12 2014 UTC,"Yes. I wanted to buy one to get signed, but I didn't want to hemorrhage 60+ bucks in one night. I'm sure the new poster will appear on their online store in a few months.  EDIT: Clarification. The poster isn't 60 bucks, but all the stuff I was buying was getting pricey."
chvrches,2hc184,OstranderN7,1 point,Wed Sep 24 23:36:06 2014 UTC,Is it wise to buy merch after the show or would most of it be gone by then?

chvrches,2h2hja,conman1112,1 point,Sun Sep 21 21:43:13 2014 UTC,I went to the Hollywood Palladium show on 9/19/14. Got in line 2 hours before the doors opened and was only 3 people back from the barrier.
chvrches,2h2hja,SaintTriangleFace,0,Mon Sep 22 00:30:49 2014 UTC,"I went to the recent Fox Theater show and only got there half an hour before The Range went on, and got 4 people back from the barrier. Probably depends on how popular they are in your area though"
chvrches,2h1rd5,Zeuxon,6,Sun Sep 21 17:31:56 2014 UTC,"At their concert in Oakland, they mentioned that the current tour will be the last one in North American supporting TBOWYB. I'm sure there will be another tour, but it'll come after they record their next album. Could be 2015; maybe 2016 depending on their schedule.  I haven't tried to get anything signed by them; for some bands you can hang around by the doors after the concert and sometimes the members will sign and chat, but you might need to wait a while and there's no guarantee. You're probably more likely to get something signed if it's a smaller venue or special event like a record store appearance. Just be nice, bring your own pen and don't bring a ton of items.  How people act will probably vary based on the venue and the crowd. The Oakland show was a little crowded so there wasn't a lot of room for dancing, but people were bouncing in place for most of the show, and sometimes clapping along, fist-pumping, etc.  I hope you get to see them on their next tour - they're great performers and have good stage presence with a wonderful sense of humor!"
chvrches,2h1rd5,cirion5,3,Sun Sep 21 19:41:46 2014 UTC,"Damn, I was really hoping I'd catch them for TBOWYB tour. There is a show at Cleveland, OH which is about 3 hours away from me. Is it worth it to drive that long to catch them on their last tour for the year? Because I'm in love with this album."
chvrches,2h1rd5,cirion5,2,Sun Sep 21 19:51:36 2014 UTC,"If it were me, I'd see if any other local friends were up for a road trip. That's a lot of driving for a single show, but if you can bring a gang along the trip itself could be a lot of fun.  If you're in love with the album, then yeah, it's a great show: I think they played every single song, and the live performance is awesome. If you were to catch them on their next show, though, I'm sure they would still play a bunch of songs from TBOWYB, and their actual set time would probably be longer; they were on stage for about 70 minutes on this tour, and it might be more like 90+ after they have two albums' worth of material to draw from."
chvrches,2h1rd5,cirion5,1 point,Sun Sep 21 21:20:55 2014 UTC,"That's what I was thinking about doing, but the crappy part is that I have class the next day at 8am and the concert's at 8pm, which means I'll probably be back home around 2am. Oh, and how was the sound at the Oakland show, was it really loud or was it perfect so that your ears weren't ringing after the show?"
chvrches,2h1rd5,scoutd,2,Sun Sep 21 21:25:58 2014 UTC,"Yeah, our show started at 8 and ended a bit before 10:30, so 2am return sounds right for you.  The sound at Oakland was amazing. I was about 1/4 of the way back from the stage, it was loud but I didn't need to wear earplugs and definitely didn't have any ringing. They had really deep, powerful, satisfying bass that you could feel but the sound didn't assault your ears too much, if that makes sense. Though, I'm not sure how much of that is the band and how much is the venue. Every show I've seen at The Fox has had incredible sound."
chvrches,2h1rd5,OstranderN7,2,Sun Sep 21 22:04:31 2014 UTC,"The venue near me is a House of Blues, which are kinda scattered around the US. So, if I go, no earplugs? I've only been to one other concert, but it was a very very small venue and my ears rung for a little while after the concert ceased, but that was most likely the venue."
chvrches,2h1rd5,OstranderN7,2,Sun Sep 21 22:10:32 2014 UTC,"I was also at the show in Oakland! They were amazing live and their performance of Tether absolutely solidified it as my favorite song. As you mentioned, it was a bit crowded. Great show!"
chvrches,2h1rd5,OstranderN7,3,Sun Sep 21 20:49:49 2014 UTC,"Got a pic with the trio and my shirt signed after the show at The Tower Theater. Granted this venue was somewhat of a special circumstance. I don't know if this venue was easier considering how tiny it was, but a dude and I just hung around their touring bus thing after, and they came out. They are ultra-fan-friendly, too. Absolutely made my night.   Take the drive to that show 3 hours away, preferably with some buddies. I just got back from deployment, and I went to both shows in LA, which required the 3 hour drive up there from San Diego and two nights in a hotel. Very much worth it, especially for front row and a bit of a meet and greet last night."
chvrches,2h1rd5,OstranderN7,2,Mon Sep 22 01:35:50 2014 UTC,"That's awesome! But, they didn't say they were going to be signing and taking pictures, it just happened? I'll definitely stick around after the show to get something signed and get a picture. So, should I wait around by their bus or the building?"
chvrches,2gwuw9,acrookednose,1 point,Sat Sep 20 00:52:19 2014 UTC,"Tweet at Chvrches, they often retweet people who are selling/need tickets for shows. Maybe they'll hook you up with a ride."

chvrches,2gt77v,coffeefirsttho,3,Thu Sep 18 23:36:05 2014 UTC,"Reporting in from Oakland! Their set tonight was a bit over an hour long, pretty much TBOWYB and some good stage patter. No covers or new stuff, but still a great show!  Oh, and their opener The Range was very good, definitely worth coming early to hear.   Edit: Acronym fail."
chvrches,2gt77v,cirion5,0,Fri Sep 19 05:35:41 2014 UTC,also just got back from the oakland show.  the set list was pretty much identical to their other shows.  I'd never seen them live before and would only call myself a casual fan but they didn't blow me away.  the sound wasn't that great and I didn't think Laurens vocals were loud enough (I was in general admission between the floor and the lower landing area.) .
chvrches,2gk7c7,MarryMe_StVincent,2,Tue Sep 16 14:15:44 2014 UTC,Nope. You're going to be rocking that venue solo style.

chvrches,2gk7c7,MarryMe_StVincent,2,Tue Sep 16 15:06:58 2014 UTC,Probably by not trying to marry her. She probably gets that a lot.  Edit: Maybe try for Martin or Iian? They probably don't get as much attention.

chvrches,2fnzb8,legaleaglebitch,1 point,Sun Sep 7 20:20:19 2014 UTC,"regular has just the 12 basic songs, holographic is special edition and has 8 more songs, also there is no release for it on discogs but i have seen 2 for sale right now on ebay"
chvrches,2fjd2t,radrico,9,Fri Sep 5 09:46:16 2014 UTC,"Chvrches live shows are amazing. The lighting setup is fantastic, the vocals sound incredible and if you've got a good crowd the room will be bouncing (even to Under The Tide, which I never saw as a particularly lively song)."
chvrches,2fjd2t,richardcook,6,Fri Sep 5 09:55:25 2014 UTC,I like Under the Tide so much better now after seeing it live. Totally takes on new energy when you see them play it.
chvrches,2fjd2t,scarecrow-boat,3,Fri Sep 5 18:45:46 2014 UTC,"Whenever I had seen videos of Under The Tide, I had always seen Martin as a little awkward during it, and not really engaging the crowd.   Then I saw it live, and it absolutely blew me away."
chvrches,2fjd2t,richardcook,0,Sat Sep 6 06:21:04 2014 UTC,"Agreed. They were amazing live. Even after they killed the entire sound system TWICE, they still put on an amazing show ...after a short ""dammit this sucks"" break in the back, after it happened the second time. I literally cried once. (Okay twice)  Funny story: I'm a bit obsessed with Chvrches, and have been for a while, and it had been years since I'd been to a concert of any kind (hence the crying, probably) so I was insanely nervous about being in the same room as Lauren,  Iain and Martin, so I had a few drinks while waiting on them to come onstage....and, well, maybe I had a few too many. I didn't black out or anything, but I did bump into a few folks, and was having too damn good of a time to remember to remember the show. Y'know, those ""self, this is important; make a memory"" moments in life. Basically, I remember being there, them being there, them being amazing, but further than that...well, let's just say I'm going to another Churches concert this year."
chvrches,2fjd2t,wheresyourtowel86,2,Sat Sep 6 05:02:42 2014 UTC,"Glad to hear that they got the sound issues sorted out! They had something go wrong when they played Big Weekend but I think they just had the wrong sound levels and it only lasted 1 song.  I have a general rule of not drinking at gigs, so I make sure I remember it. Haha, I'm going to another as well. Seen them twice already this year, and seeing them twice again in November."
chvrches,2fjd2t,richardcook,3,Sat Sep 6 06:25:47 2014 UTC,"Not only one of the best LOOKING shows I've seen but it's one the best SOUNDING as well. Vocals and voice were very clear, something some bands fuck up a lot"
chvrches,2fjd2t,YoshiYogurt,2,Fri Sep 5 11:11:48 2014 UTC,"I've seen them twice. First time was awesome: great set, energy, performances, and lighting.   Second time was meh. They finished really early and the energy was weak. Apparently Lauren had some Torchy's Tacos that weren't ""agreeing"" with her and that's why they wrapped it up early."
chvrches,2fjd2t,byerover,1 point,Fri Sep 5 18:02:31 2014 UTC,Are you thinking of their November show in Austin?
chvrches,2fjd2t,Nihiliste,2,Fri Sep 5 23:14:29 2014 UTC,"Three times - Cardiff University, Primavera Festival in Barcelona and Glastonbury. They're fairly decent live but I was quite disappointed to see three near identical setlists for those three gigs, the same intros/buildups and mid-song habits (e.g. Lauren's fist-to-the-sky move at the end of Lies), but the most significant negative... the crowds. Every time I've seen Chvrches I've been utterly hyped and ready to dance and bounce until my feet hurt, only to be faced with utterly boring comatose crowds. During the Cardiff show I was even told off by one idiot woman for dancing next to her because I was shaking her camera whilst she was trying to take pictures - this being one/two rows from front-centre.   They're a great band who'll no doubt grow into their live shows where everything will flow a bit more naturally, but I hope to god their fans liven up a bit because they're undoubtedly the worst set I've ever encountered."
chvrches,2fjd2t,moz_1983,2,Mon Sep 8 15:04:27 2014 UTC,"Seen them 10 times, they've grown to become one of the best live bands around right now."
chvrches,2fjd2t,legaleaglebitch,2,Tue Sep 9 18:40:28 2014 UTC,"I never knew I could fall in love with them even more. The lights, their sound = on point. The best part of seeing them was discovering that Strong Hand existed. Seeing them a second time was equally satisfying even though there were no lights (Coachella). Seeing them a third time next week."
chvrches,2fjd2t,mvse,2,Thu Sep 11 07:36:09 2014 UTC,"they're awesome! waited early, got best spot in venue and lauren tossed me her setlist after their set. disappointed they aren't doing nyc again this fall, but i'm sure they'll be back."

chvrches,2fjd2t,Nihiliste,1 point,Fri Sep 5 23:14:04 2014 UTC,"I guess I'll be the negative one, but I saw them at a festival in October 2013 and it was pretty underwhelming.  She sounded decent but looked very awkward and uncomfortable, as a whole they had very little stage presence.  I did pick Martin out of a crowd about 30 minutes after the show and talked to him for 5-10 minutes, so that was pretty cool.  He was a nice guy.  It was funny that no one else recognized him.  Granted this was before the album had come out, maybe they have gotten more confidence and figured stuff out since then.  I missed them when they were here a few months ago, but I'd give them another shot since I am fan."

chvrches,2fe23n,Nihiliste,6,Thu Sep 4 16:14:13 2014 UTC,"in her op-ed piece she was really mad about comments people make online about her physical appearance. While I thought she was stating the obvious (something virtually every celebrity goes through) it was still an interesting topic to bring up.   In her ama and in other interviews though, she basically says she does not even try to have a stage presence because its misogynistic to expect her to dance around and ""be sexy"" and that sort of thing. I thought that was too far in particular. She's a fucking entertainer and half the time she is on stage she looks bored or uninterested- to find out she purposefully does that leaves me perplexed. This quote from their Iama really turned me off    Every time someone tells us ""she should smile more"" or ""she should dance more"", I can't help but think that they wouldn't say that if I fronted this band and was male   No Lauren, if you were a male singing upbeat electronic music looking bored as shit and uninterested I would think the same thing.That's basically my small gripe, obviously I still love the band."
chvrches,2fe23n,The_Thane_Of_Cawdor,5,Thu Sep 4 16:27:08 2014 UTC,"I have to agree on this, Lauren and Martin's stage presence is so different and I must admit, I prefer Martin's. I'm not saying that Lauren should be dancing around like a crazy person but a bit of movement would help, aside from the occasional mic wire movement."
chvrches,2fe23n,pounro,4,Fri Sep 5 12:59:48 2014 UTC,Yeah she does not have to do Brittany Spears bull shit or anything but a little enthusiasm would be nice

chvrches,2d3woh,droidroid,2,Sun Aug 10 00:28:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah I guess that it was switched to Lauren at some point, or maybe Lauren always sang it and this was just Martin having a go, idk."

Normally you can pick up a ticket for a gig say +£10 face value which is ""fair enough"" but the £60 third party resellers are charging is extortionate.   On the bright side, the lack of tickets being resold by Joe public suggests that the people who purchased tickets in the first place are actually fans, which is nice considering it isn't always the normative position these days."

Linkin Park's latest album was a result of Mike Shinoda not wanting to make a more pop-synth type of record. That was what the comment was about. Mike is actually a huge fan of CHVRCHES and all the bands he listed on the original interview this article is quoting from. Lauren got baited into attacking Linkin Park because that douche ""Journalist"" asked her to respond to a version of what Mike said that wasn't consistent with his views."

So let's end it here before some circlejerk hate starts against Linkin Park. Both are great bands and CHVRCHES were being baited for an unnecessary retaliation.

With Linkin Park I know that Chester (singer/screamer) did his band tryout over the telephone with Shinoda and got in that way. They haven't had a decent song since their first EP anyway. I'd like to think they're just trying to stay relevant by causing stirs but people buy their music up.  Also this is the 2nd shitty thing I've seen them pull in like a month.

CHVRCHES may be getting bigger but the FAN fan base is still pretty close knit. Just get there ~40 minutes before the show (because this is LA, maybe an hour), and you should be solid. Look for me! I'll be wearing a tan chvrches tour tshirt, would be cool to meet another redditor fan!"

chvrches,29568z,ps_,3,Sun Jun 29 18:10:10 2014 UTC,"i saw them last month in nyc, got there at 2:45 for 7pm doors....totally overestimated it, probably could have gotten there at 5 and been maybe ten places further back in line. anyhow, got best spot front and center on the rail, so i don't regret it. anyhow, i think it varies by venue and would say two hours before doors open is probably the latest if you're going for the rail, maybe some others can chime in..."
chvrches,29568z,ps_,2,Thu Jun 26 14:56:38 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I too, was going to go that early. Were you the first ones there and if so, how long till the next group of people came by and when did it start to get crowded?"
chvrches,29568z,ps_,4,Thu Jun 26 20:20:08 2014 UTC,"i was the fourth one there, and by five there was probably ~20 or so. not a lot by any stretch, but enough that you'd have to settle being off to the side or behind someone. but again i can't speak except for that experience...last week i went to see the band phantogram, same venue, also sold out...didn't arrive until quarter to 4 and i was the first on line. so it's anyone's guess, i'd just err on going earlier, and if anything go grab food or wait someplace nearby if it's empty.  anyhow, from what i saw the crowds started rolling in around 6ish. ny and la are probably similar in turnout size and all too.  p.s. if you get there too early, at least you can console yourself with the knowledge that you'll have this view!!"

Now Is Not The Time and ZVVL. ZVVL was never played live but Now Is Not The Time was played before it was retired around the time of their first US tour I believe.  I'm not sure as to the exact reason as to why, but probably something to do with popularity. IIRC the EP didn't do too well in terms of sales the first time around, even though it was fantastic. Or maybe they just don't sound good live. Maybe they just didn't fit in with album.  As you can tell I know of no definite reason, it could be in their AMA or an interview so check through a few of those."
chvrches,2955ln,bferret,1 point,Thu Jun 26 16:58:39 2014 UTC,"I responded on another comment, that Lauren said they can't sing it without a reason. I also think its because the song might be in their 2nd album and that they're holding off for it."

chvrches,26u86v,Wanderlust3,11,Fri May 30 01:43:02 2014 UTC,They've been on tour nearly non-stop for almost 2 years now... I think it's getting to them.
chvrches,26u86v,bferret,2,Fri May 30 05:26:11 2014 UTC,"no new material, gets boring for them."
chvrches,26u86v,insectlife,4,Fri May 30 16:56:10 2014 UTC,"Just thought about this, and wanted to clarify that it wasn't a ""bitchy"" comment, just fact. Bands who always play the same stuff over a short period of time inevitable just go through the motions. Nature. Truck emotional labour."
chvrches,26u86v,insectlife,2,Fri May 30 18:13:26 2014 UTC,"It's true that it might get boring to play the same songs the same way. However, they could find so many other ways to play the songs, like they do with their ""stripped down"" versions of some of their songs.  It gets boring for the listener as well when all they do is trigger the same pre-programmed Ableton sequence and Lauren sings the same exact way as the studio recordings. That just might be a drawback of being in an electronic band. It would add so much to their performance if all audio output was done live and on-the-fly, but the complexity and potential failure of their electronic instruments probably prevents them from wanting to take that risk.  Maybe they could organize a synchronized light show like purityring, or add a live drummer. Live percussion would definitely help break the monotony of repetition."
chvrches,26u86v,marshmallowwisdom,2,Fri May 30 20:44:55 2014 UTC,"At Terminal 5, they had different visuals for every song. They basically had a big LED board in the shape of their logo and it looked like they had preset patterns that were triggered by an av guy. I'm not sure how to describe it, but the board had the capability for a lot of different colors and patterns/sequences. If the concert was any different for you, I can upload some pics and maybe a video of what I'm talking about."
chvrches,26u86v,Audience,2,Sat May 31 01:03:33 2014 UTC,"They have some awesome versions of other people's songs, though. I was in Primavera, and I would have loved to see them play Do I wanna know by the Arctic Monkeys. Best cover I've heard.   And I'm going to DCode festival in Madrid, on september, just hoping they'll play that song."
chvrches,26u86v,0x537,3,Thu Jun 5 19:58:02 2014 UTC,"I was probably a few rows behind you but more off to the left. It wasn't a bad show by any means but it would be nice to have their sets shaken up a bit. I'd love to see Lauren loosen up a little bit whilst performing - without wanting to sound patronising, perhaps that will come with experience as the timidness gives way to confidence and a bit of attitude (lyrically there's a hell of a lot of attitude in some of the songs which seems a bit too 'restrained' live). From a live point of view, I'd prefer if the snares/beats sounded a bit louder as well. They were great though, I'll be seeing them for the third time at Glastonbury!"
chvrches,26u86v,moz_1983,2,Mon Jun 2 15:25:36 2014 UTC,"I was there. It was great, fun and good quality sound but it was my first time seeing them so maybe you're right."

chvrches,26m8o5,MarryMe_StVincent,2,Tue May 27 23:47:17 2014 UTC,'45 minutes of disappointment'. very true! I think the only sound that the range got from the crowd was when he mixing 'we sink'!
chvrches,26m8o5,ps_,2,Wed May 28 12:43:23 2014 UTC,"so true. He like made us believe that we were going to hear something actually worth listening to, and then crushed our hopes yet again."

chvrches,24pl7q,Audience,3,Tue May 6 01:26:57 2014 UTC,I saw that! I think the dude tried to move forward or grabbed one of their friends.  I was a tall guy who was behind like 6 or 7 people from the stage at the beginning. I managed to get up to the 3rd row and I grabbed the set list that Martin balled up and threw. Hopefully I didn't squash too many people but I really wanted that shit.

I was next to him so I had a view of the fight that almost erupted but where the hat went is still a mystery.   To clarify on what happened, a drunk guy was pushing his way through the crowd and eventually knocked into my friend. My friend then proceeded to smack the drunk guy in the back of the head and called him a prick. Drunk male shows no worry and just continues on his rush through the crowd."

chvrches,248j79,MarryMe_StVincent,1 point,Tue Apr 29 02:04:54 2014 UTC,Added them on the post!
chvrches,248j79,MrAchievables,2,Tue Apr 29 07:33:00 2014 UTC,Do you have the Falling cover as well?
chvrches,248j79,SuffocatingNostalgia,2,Tue Apr 29 09:44:04 2014 UTC,"Nope I don't. If you give me the YouTube link, I could possibly make one."

chvrches,248j79,delicious_dioxin,2,Thu May 1 09:07:07 2014 UTC,I ripped the 'I Would Die for V' cover from Soundcloud if anybody wants it. I also have the Hurricane remix (although that is downloadable from CHVRCHES soundcloud).
chvrches,248j79,mishtram,1 point,Tue Apr 29 20:59:29 2014 UTC,Link it and I can add them to the list!
chvrches,248j79,adapada,1 point,Thu May 1 09:08:37 2014 UTC,"I have them on my computer, they're not posted online...  Except for this: https://soundcloud.com/msmrsounds/ms-mr-hurricane-chvrches-remix"
chvrches,248vs9,SamHinkie,2,Tue Apr 29 03:04:01 2014 UTC,"Tweet at them. They have been retweeting people looking for tickets recently, couldnt hurt right. Also, get ready, I saw them in raleigh last night and it was amazing."
chvrches,248vs9,lowriderbassethound,1 point,Wed Apr 30 03:18:36 2014 UTC,"Good idea, that's definitely worth a try. Glad you enjoyed it, really excited to finally see them live."
chvrches,248vs9,ajsondheim,1 point,Wed Apr 30 03:57:16 2014 UTC,I have 2 tix for saturday show that im trying to sell for face value
chvrches,248vs9,Firocket1690,1 point,Thu May 1 17:20:20 2014 UTC,Looking to get rid of two tickets for Sunday. Almost 40 after fees :/
chvrches,2463gm,rhyminandstealin,7,Mon Apr 28 06:57:07 2014 UTC,Night before terminal 5? Yes yes yes yes yes yes
chvrches,246jno,popnwave,4,Mon Apr 28 12:40:12 2014 UTC,"I heard The Mother We Share in Buffalo Wild Wings the other night. Also, one of the local theaters plays Night Sky while showing static ad images before the movie. They'll be on The Tonight Show this week I think which is pretty damn mainstream."
chvrches,2401iu,interface2x,5,Sat Apr 26 01:46:33 2014 UTC,There are a lot of songs called Tightrope I've noticed.
chvrches,2401iu,treadbau5,3,Sat Apr 26 05:13:49 2014 UTC,"This one is the Janelle Monáe cover, I believe."
chvrches,2401iu,acrookednose,4,Sat Apr 26 14:21:29 2014 UTC,Can someone let me know if the Tightrope is the same live performance or a new one?
chvrches,2401iu,acrookednose,5,Sat Apr 26 17:27:52 2014 UTC,if this is a studio tightrope I'm gonna shit myself.
chvrches,2401iu,bferret,10,Sat Apr 26 17:32:23 2014 UTC,It appears to be from their Alucard (Iain's studio iirc) sessions. So it is in that stripped back style as their latest Recover EP.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/fah2lv4xo5j01li/16-chvrches-tightrope.mp3  enjoy
chvrches,2401iu,acrookednose,1 point,Tue Apr 29 16:40:24 2014 UTC,You're fucking beautiful I love you<3
chvrches,2401iu,anyare,1 point,Tue Apr 29 17:16:19 2014 UTC,Holy shit that sounds amazing. Lauren's voice is on point.
chvrches,2401iu,acrookednose,1 point,Tue Apr 29 23:48:01 2014 UTC,Thank you!!
chvrches,2401iu,unkn0wn1,2,Wed Apr 30 01:29:47 2014 UTC,GUYS ITS A FUCKING STUDIO VERSION SOMEBODY FIND ME THIS
chvrches,2401iu,TonyPulis,2,Sun Apr 27 22:42:35 2014 UTC,"I just listened to it. There's a really beautiful falsetto-y octave change at 2:50.   TL;DR: REALLY SHORT, REALLY GOOD."
chvrches,2401iu,acrookednose,2,Mon Apr 28 04:30:00 2014 UTC,That thing Lauren does with her voice was the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
chvrches,23rz7f,iLuv3M3,4,Wed Apr 23 16:11:14 2014 UTC,"In Reno they had 2 posters, One which was signed (the other had tour dates). 2 different shirts, light and dark.  A tote and also the album on vinyl."
chvrches,23rz7f,popnwave,1 point,Wed Apr 23 17:04:58 2014 UTC,How much were posters going for?
chvrches,23rz7f,popnwave,3,Wed Apr 23 17:30:23 2014 UTC,$30 for the autographed one. I think the other was $20.
chvrches,23rz7f,popnwave,2,Wed Apr 23 18:30:40 2014 UTC,Did they have a very limited amount of autographed? I'd like to add a Chvrches poster to my wall of concert posters.
chvrches,23rz7f,richardcook,3,Wed Apr 23 18:44:56 2014 UTC,"They didn't sell out of them at our show, I am sure they sign a new batch if they run out.   It's a signed variation of this, the text has been changed to reflect the 2014 US tour - http://methanestudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CHVRCHES-POSTER.jpg  And the unsigned one is a variation of this with the current US tour dates on it - http://kierongillen.tumblr.com/image/78445869512"
chvrches,23rz7f,morning_mist,1 point,Wed Apr 23 19:16:27 2014 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the info :]. Can't wait to see them again"
chvrches,23rz7f,morning_mist,2,Wed Apr 23 20:10:29 2014 UTC,In Glasgow most of the merch was just the shirts you can get online. Their tour poster is awesome though! They were selling that for £10. popnwave posted it in a comment in this thread (the unsigned one - they weren't selling signed posters in Glasgow).
chvrches,23rz7f,tunaman808,1 point,Mon Apr 28 19:28:48 2014 UTC,Hmm wonder if the signed posters are a random thing or a US tour thing. Thank you though.
