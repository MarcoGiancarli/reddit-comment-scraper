Unity2D,3e5lr5,BlueCandleGames,2,Wed Jul 22 04:59:33 2015 UTC,"Looks like you just made hitByBall(uncapitalized) private, accessible through HitByBall(capitalized), but your other script is still attempting to reference hitByBall(uncapitalized).  On a side note (and as I kept typing I realized: a series of side notes), properties are awesome if you want some data to be accessible publicly but its exact characteristics may someday change internally (you have a Deck of cards object, at the moment you're just storing its length after you build it, but you suspect you may someday want to return some list<Card>.Count or something, without breaking your hundred other scripts depending on ListLength being accurate. This can also be useful for read-only ""report"" type of variables (RecentlyHitByBall) which are important to know but don't make sense to be changeable from the outside. Finally, having encapsulation (provided by GetVarName() or a property's get{}) is bonkers-important if any other person is ever going to use or even smell your code, but it's not going to kill you (too quickly) if not every single value is perfectly contained. It will make your life seriously easier later on, but if you find yourself writing publicVar{get{return privateVar;} set{privateVar=value;}} without really knowing why you want the extra layer and/or without writing any code to keep security or sanity (and not needing any), you're probably fine saving the forty seconds to compose the accessor.  Oh yeah and minor naming convention recommendation, my team tends to use camelCase for variables, public or otherwise, _underscoredCamelCase for public/private pair private variables, and reserve PascalCase for Class and Function name. That is, however, totally up to you while it's just you, but if or when you become part of a team, you'll want to land on something consistent for everybody's benefit in terms of readability.  Good luck!"

I need to definitely pick it back up sometime.  Only downside I can see nowadays is that most of the tutorials are based around Unity 4.6, and while I'm sure some things taught still apply in Unity 5.1, there may be some things that have changed. Not too certain about that though."

The only thing I predict taking a hit will be updates and responses to questions, though the rest of the students in the class do an excellent job at helping each other work through problems, which is also incredibly helpful.   The other dev went to work on an F# lesson hosted through the same site. It's currently seeking kickstarter funding and last I checked doing fairly well there.

If you really mean that every object with the tag has a line to ever other object with it, then I suppose you could even use one single LineRenderer for all of them. In that case, set the vertex count to the number of objects plus one and set each position to a position of an object. The last and first positions would both be the location of the first object."

There are lots of approaches to FSMs, managing state, transitions, etc. I'm a big believer in KISS so the two approaches I use are stupidly simple (see StateKit for both approaches: https://github.com/prime31/StateKit)  States as Objects (StateKit): the main class that runs the state machine is considered the context of it (could be player, enemy, menu, etc). Each state is a class. That class has access to the context. These scale very nicely. Just add a new class for any new states. Code stays nice and clean in all its state files.  Standard FSM (StateKitLite): states are enums. Everything is in one file so this is best only used for more simple state machines. Single file does keep things simple so that is a plus."

That person might want that game to provide some revenue, and you are just undercutting them.  On the other hand, they provided a development video on twitch so it's not like they were trying to protect their idea.  Basically I think you should come up with your own idea for a game and make that.   If you still want to release the game and not be a cunt, then email the guy you stole the idea from and see if they are happy for you to release it.  I am working on a game, with no expectation it will make money. I am not an experienced or fast Unity developer. Right now I am supporting a wife and child, and can only do personal work like this for about an hour a day. I am learning as I go.  If an experienced dev saw my idea, then made a game out of it in a couple of days and released it for free, I would be pretty pissed off. That's why I don't develop on twitch!"

I don't do game dev for a living, I to have a 9-17 job and bills to pay and can only do this things in my free time :).   I will contact the guy on twitch and talk about what I did, if he is against me publishing the game I will definitely not publish it! Thank you for your input!"

The graphical style is basic but I think that's what gives it its charm.  I didn't have sound on (sorry!) but the trailer seems to work really well - basically shows you the game progressing from dead simple to some of the harder levels pretty well; it's always great to see a trailer jump straight into gameplay video IMO.  The only criticism I'd have (and granted it's a REALLY picky one!), is that the logo right at the end of the video looks a bit out of place, because the font is really crisp, whereas the rest of the game has a pixel-art/8-bit feel.

Unity2D,3dxb3q,Ziik_bg,2,Mon Jul 20 08:32:33 2015 UTC,"Been tackling this problem myself for the last couple of days.  You will see a performance hit using an object for each tile. Each object will have a transform and a draw call (though unity has automatic batching draw calls). Which will add a small overhead which will grow the more objects you have.  Whether you can get away with using single objects depends on your target platform. Your average PC could probably handle anywhere between a few hundred to a few thousand tiles before it became an issue. (There would always be a performance hit using this method, but depending on how intensive your game is elsewhere it may not matter) You could also enable and disable tiles based on whether they are within view of the camera. Ideally you would want to reuse tiles by pooling them rather than destroying them once they are not needed (i.e loading a new level). This would save a massive amount of garbage collection.   Other options include batching tiles together. So say rather than having 1 tile per object you could make textures that have 3,4,5... tiles. That way you cover the same amount of space while having fewer objects. But if you plan on doing random generation this will likely make patterns more obvious.   The more complicated way to do it, but also the most efficient I have found so far. Is is to generate a mesh and a texture at run time. I spent the weekend testing this and was able to build a 100x100 randomly generated tile grid (10,000 tiles) with each tile being 32x32 that uses only 2 draw calls and 4 vertices for the entire thing: http://i.imgur.com/1lCDv2e.png  The way it works is the script creates a large mesh at runtime (which is essentially a giant quad), then it creates a texture. I have an array of an array of colours (color[][]) which stores the pixel data of a tile atlas in 32x32 blocks. I then use a for loop to iterate through the texture having it pick random tiles form the array and placing them on the texture. At this point I could pull in data from elsewhere (such as XML data from Tiled) and then use that to pick which tile/s to use for that specific point.   This may all sound rather complex or like jibberish. But before this weekend I was in the boat of not knowing anything about mesh or texture generation. It's not that difficult to learn.   The only disadvantage to this is the texture is obviously rather large. Though currently 100x100 only takes up about 60mb in VRAM which isn't huge."
Unity2D,3dxb3q,Kinths,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:57:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the extensive answer!  What do you mean by ""pooling"" the tiles?  As far as I understand you get the colors with Texture2D.GetPixels from a random tile sprite, store them in color[][] and ""paint"" them on the mesh?"
Unity2D,3dxb3q,Kinths,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:41 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""pooling"" the tiles?   That is if you decide to use a Gameobject per tile. You could set up some arrays for tiles that you populate on the initial load. It would have a certain amount of copies of each tile. Then have your engine pull tiles from a not in use pool(array/list) when generating and add them to an ""in use"" pool. Then instead of destroying them you disable them and add them to the not in use array so they can be reused. This saves a large amount of garbage collection and loading. It's generally a good idea to do this if you have Gameobjects that get used a lot. For instance bullets from a gun. Rather than creating a bullet every time you fire and then destroying it. You instead create a pool of say 20 bullets (depends on how fast your gun shoots) which you enable and disable as needed. This saves a whole bunch of loading and garbage collection. The same principal can be applied to many things. Such as Tile generation.    As far as I understand you get the colors with Texture2D.GetPixels from a random tile sprite, store them in color[][] and ""paint"" them on the mesh?   For the generate mesh and texture during runtime method yes."

Unity2D,3dxb3q,Kinths,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:06 2015 UTC,Sorry my reply was slightly wrong. You paint them onto another texture that you create at runtime then apply the texture to the mesh. Usually a material.

Unity2D,3dxb3q,Kinths,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:14:41 2015 UTC,"Depends what you are using for lighting. Unity's lighting works as normal.  If you are talking about picking a tile and changing it's colour to dim it then it might be difficult. It's easy enough to change a tile on the fly (or at least should be, I haven't done it personally but all you would need is the texture coordinates for the tile). If you already have a second tile with a dimmed colour you could just replace it with that. What you wouldn't be able to do is say change the albedo of a material to dim it etc since it is all one texture."

I hope this helps"
Unity2D,3dvovi,JavierCaruso,2,Sun Jul 19 23:31:20 2015 UTC,"So I started working with your code, struggled with it for a few minutes and thought about it. This will suffer from a few issues. First, your distance check is a box. So while the you are checking a set distance in the x and y axis, when checking diagonally you are really looking 1.4x that distance. You will also have the same issue with the movement. Moving up and left in the same frame will actually move you 1.4x faster in the diagonal. Luckily, the code to move towards another object is actually pretty simple if you use the vector2.moveTowards() method (there is one for Vector3 as well but if you don't need the Z axis using Vector2 will be faster). It will move you a constant distance to the target point and won't have problems with diagonal movement.  using UnityEngine; using System.Collections;  public class MoveMob : MonoBehaviour {     public GameObject attack;      public float distance;     public float attackDistance;      public float speed;      void Update () {         //get the distance from self to target         float dist = Vector2.Distance(transform.position, attack.transform.position);         //if we are between distance and attackDistance         if (dist <= distance && dist > attackDistance)         {             //calculate a new position             Vector2 newPos = Vector2.MoveTowards(transform.position, attack.transform.position, speed * Time.deltaTime);             //set to transform             transform.position = new Vector3(newPos.x, newPos.y, 0f);         }     } }   I also added an attack distance which is a distance that the enemy will stop when within range."

If you write an app using Unity, you'll have to deal with 3 major disadvantages versus apps made with the native tools:   Unity apps are slow to start. This rules out any kind of quick use app like a todo list. Unity apps take up a lot of space. A nice calender app written with native tools can be 1 or 2 MB. An empty android project built with Unity is about 20 MB. Unity apps eat up a lot of battery power. As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, games run in a different way than typical apps.   And despite uGUI being a huge leap forward for Unity, it is still lightyears behind the ""real"" native UI tools available on iOS, Android and Windows Phone. You'll be able to create must nicer UIs in much less time using the native tools (after the learning curve).  So if you're hoping to compete with other apps on the app store that are written with the native tools, you're going to have a hard time. But if you're making some niche apps or internal-use apps, you could probably make it work."
Unity2D,3du049,Rouxmire,2,Mon Jul 20 04:32:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, it can be done.  I've been doing it for years, though most of my apps are used internally and I can't paste links for NDA reasons.  That's true of many of the Unity non-game apps (if you go to the Unite conference, you'll talk to people who say things they cannot post on facebook or reddit) but those apps are definitely out there if you look around for them.  Using Unity is a great way to build whatever you want, especially now with uGUI and all the 2D support. (though most of my stuff is with ezgui, because that was the only real viable option 6 years ago)  Being able to build it once and deploy it cross platform is a tremendous help.  You may still have to deal with some platform specific wonkiness here and there, depending on what kind of stuff you're trying to do, but it's still WORLDS easier than trying to write the same app in Objective-C and Java.  PhoneGap is great if you're just trying to wrap a mobile website, but if that's all you're trying to do, just make a mobile website and don't tell someone you can make them an ""app"" just because it now has an icon.  Most of the other cross platform toolkits have similar results or difficulties (like Xamarin, which is very powerful, but also very tedious and you can't make really nice UIs in there).  All that to say, yes, it can be done, yes, people are doing it even though most of what you hear about Unity is game related.  Go for it!  :)"

PhoneGap basically covers an app wrapper around a website or static html stored in there.  If you want to make a serious non-game app, that's the LAST thing you need to be doing.  If you want to make a mobile website, make a mobile website.  Don't tell people PhoneGap makes serious apps, because it just doesn't.   Unity is really draining on phone batteries.   That's a really broad statement and not really true, either.  Yes, poorly made Unity apps are really draining on phone batteries, but you could substitute any other tool name in there, and still have a true statement."
Unity2D,3du049,Rouxmire,4,Sun Jul 19 13:51:41 2015 UTC,Games run differently than regular apps. Games (including unity games/apps) work by rerendering and redrawing the entire screen over and over as fast as possible (or 60 times per second depending on vsync). It never rests. Apps written using the native tools will only run and render when something changes. This makes a huge difference in battery life.

I've seen plenty of natively built apps that sucked the life out of the battery.  And there's stuff like Fallout: Shelter (don't know what tools were used to make it) that drains the battery like there's no tomorrow.  He said ""Unity is really draining on phone batteries"" -- which is a little too blanket of a statement for me to sit by without saying anything.  We're still balancing using it vs writing native code in 2 completely different languages and SDKs.  I'll take Unity whenever possible in that scenario."

Applications (and many games for that matter) tend to feature rich user-interfaces and you'd want to do things like present lists, data-grids, have UI's that respond to changes in data and layout, etc. Although uGUI offers a solid foundation (the anchor layout system is great) it doesn't really compare to frameworks like WPF/angularjs/Caliburn.Micro, etc.  So I ended up creating my own framework based on uGUI. It offers a declarative design language (XML) and it utilizes the MVVM pattern. It features data-binding, animations, theming, catalogue of widgets, dynamic content, responsive layout, and much more.  Examples showcasing how intuitive and powerful a proper MVVM framework can be: Features"

Also, I don't see anything in your asset store description about whether it runs on mobile at all or how well.  I would fix those two things (making 4.6 the base required and telling people if it's compatible with mobile) if that's within your capability to do so.  I think you'll sell more if you do.

I would have a uniform start and end across all rooms. Then loop through the width of the room, adding new platforms and setting the x position for the next platform as the width of the current platform + the desired gap, the height of the current platform would be set as the last platforms height +/- Math.Random()*(jumpHeight-marginOfError) You'd want to tune the marginOfError based on the difficulty you want, the smaller it is, the more precise the player has to be in timing their jumps.  If you want to get a little more fancy, you could come up with a few ideas for features you want in the combination of platforms, and then make a enumerator that represents the different features. For example, maybe two short platforms right after each other, and call that DOUBLE_JUMP. Then when you're looping through the width of the room like I was talking about before, you'd randomly select a feature from the enumerator, and then generate the corresponding feature applying the same ideas as before.

Personally, I create the initial animation-clip/animator pair from 2 or more sprites, name them as needed, and all subsequent clips are created by creating a new empty clip within the existing animation-clip/animator pair. Frame-based animations are then selected and dragged into the empty clip. This way the new animation clip is already correctly applied to the animator object.  The ""new"" method is pretty much the same as the ""old"" method.   When you clicked+dragged multiple sprites in at once, you would get an Explorer window asking you where you want to store the file, and the name always defaulted as well.  The new method simply doesn't bother presenting the window... You can still easily rename the file(s), and just as easily navigate to the appropriate folder."

Unity2D,3djrmn,IronRule,2,Thu Jul 16 20:56:25 2015 UTC,Here's a thread with some concepts. I also like the #2 post's method on that same page.
Unity2D,3djrmn,GuideZ,2,Fri Jul 17 02:06:09 2015 UTC,"Don't move towards the center of the province, but move perpendicular to the edge itself. As long as you make sure your edges have the same winding, then you can easily calculate a vector that consistently points inwards. One way to do that is (y, -x). (and the other direction would be (-y, x)). So now you can calculate the normal of every edge. Next you will want to loop over every vertex and average the normals of the touching edges. That way you have a smoothed vertex normal you can use to move inwards."

However I think I may have to still modify this slightly to deal with reflex angles (which will be rare but could happen). I think to cover those cases I might need to create a new vertex in the middle of the angle, inset the same distance. Starting out this seemed like such a small thing lol."

With that said, I would then add an event ([click me]) to the end of each animation clip, calling whatever function I need to for that step in the loop.

Unity2D,3dfap9,zarralax,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:34:20 2015 UTC,"What's happening is that you're still in the activation area when you press the key to advance text, and if the same key is used to advance and to initiate the dialogue then it keeps resetting the dialogue back to the start.  To fix this you could simply add a check into the ActivateAextAtLine script that checks if the dialogue box is open and wont run if that's the case. So within the check for a button press in the Update section you could add something like:  if(theTextBox.isActive) {     return; }   That should free you to be able to use the same key throughout it all :)"

Unity2D,3ddkw9,blindedeyes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:19:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, shaders and the lighting system are the biggest perceivable changes.   However, the actual changelists between unity4 and unity5 are huge. Granted, bugfixes are typically applied to both engines, unless the bug was specific to Unity5 etc.  There has been a decent level of optimisation on both 3D and 2D systems - but nothing earth shattering. Single-digit percents in most areas.  Having android/iOS sockets unlocked without needing their specific pro licenses is excellent though.  If you are looking to upgrade to 5, take the subscription package. Level 11 has been pretty good for assets so far."
Unity2D,3ddkw9,lleti,-2,Wed Jul 15 19:25:11 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, the only improvements made were to 3D rendering. They did optimize the graphics for both 2D and 3D, but unless you're making a huge-ass game it shouldn't be a big deal."
Unity2D,3dcwvn,Empirion,2,Wed Jul 15 07:51:13 2015 UTC,"I would suggest doing it through code.  So lets say you wanted to bring it to a specific y-cord off screen, but want to bring it back to its original position at some point, you could do something like this:  private Vector3 startPosition; //The starting rest position of your main button sign object public Vector3 restPosition; //The position for it off screen. This is public so you can adjust in the editor if you need to public float moveSpeed; //This is how fast it moves off/on screen  private enum State {     MovingUp = 0,     MovingDown,     Resting }  private State state;  Start() {     startPosition = transform.position;     state = State.Resting; }   //Here's where the fun happens. Switching the state of your buttons is up to you and however you want to do it when you want to do it. But once the state has been changed, this is basically how you want everything to work. This is of course working under the assumption you're moving the object UP to a resting place  Update() {     switch(state)     {         case State.MovingUp:             if(transform.position.y < restPosition.y)             {                 transform.position += new Vector3(0,moveSpeed,0) * Time.deltaTime;             }             else             {                 transform.position = restPosition;                 state = State.Resting;             }         break;          case State.MovingDown:             if(transform.position.y > startPosition.y)             {                 transform.position -= new Vector3(0,moveSpeed,0) * Time.deltaTime;             }             else             {                 transform.position = startPosition;                 state = State.Resting;             }         break;          case State.Resting:         break;     } }   It's super early, and I didn't type this in an IDE to see if I made any basic mistakes, so I might have missed something/have some compile errors but if not that should be exactly what you need.

Unity2D,3dcwvn,Dexilles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:55:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the suggestion. I forgot to say... using Lerp on the parent object also seems to break the entire setup, as certain chains become detached, and don't re-attach (like it sometimes happens... if you stretch the hingejoints, they slowly retract to place).   I'm thinking of using Rigidbody2d.moveposition (I'll try it later today) on each individual piece of the menu, because it seems trying to move the parent container be it by animation or code, just screws the whole thing."
Unity2D,3dcwvn,Khael8,2,Wed Jul 15 12:24:34 2015 UTC,"I did a quick test with 2 buttons, 1 hinge joint and 1 parent game object. It seems alright to me. But yeah, usually it's not recommended to ""teleport"" dynamic physics objects especially when used with joints.  Do you need to have the physics running when it's animating? If not, you can disable the rigid bodies and joints during animation using an animation event.   You've mentioned that it's like a chain. Would it be possible just to animate the top of the chain and the rest of the buttons would naturally be pulled up?"
Unity2D,3dcwvn,Khael8,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:54:12 2015 UTC,"my menu has 2 big buttons, 4 smallers ones, and 2 even smaller ones. there's a total of 17 chain links :)  here's the thing... the boards react to being touched/clicked (with a bit of force) and it looks great with all the pieces hanging and shaking. I have tried turning all the pieces isKinematic property on, after clicking on the board, and immediately before moving them, and yes, in that case, there's no issue. But... I lose all feedback and cool looking physics from clicking the buttons. It would be the same as turning physics completely off.   If I animate just the top chain links (there's actually 2 of them because the first boards are kinda wide) it unfortunately stretches everything else behind it. It would need to move really slowly so it wouldn't look like it's falling apart."
Unity2D,3dcwvn,Khael8,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:02:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand. So you want the physics to be turned on while animating? If not, you can just turn off the physics when the menu is being moved off-screen and turn it back on when it's moved into place.   If I animate just the top chain links (there's actually 2 of them because the first boards are kinda wide) it unfortunately stretches everything else behind it. It would need to move really slowly so it wouldn't look like it's falling apart.   I'd think that you'd have that issue even if you go through the non-animation route. The physics engine probably can't accurately calculate when the object is moved with that speed and with that many links. I forgot which variable is more relevant to improving joint solving but you can mess around with velocity iterations and position iteration in Project Settings > Physics 2D. I had mine set to 16 velocity iterations and 6 position iterations."

I'm not sure whether this is applicable to your situation but I do remember that when trying to simulate a chain using a lot of hinge joints, a distance joint with max distance enabled is used to link the head of the chain to the tail of the chain to prevent the chain from being stretched and breaking the hinge joints."

Here's a mockup example of what it might eventually be:  https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/50c125b5c85f20bd68002c90/50c2078a73f544bf680086ef/f022364b026ccb32f1b595bfeb6413c9/WSFlower2.gif  I'm pretty satisfied with everything right now, so I'm going to do the tedious task of going through and cleaning up all the logic bugs and issues. And I need to start getting some actual art. >.< :D"

Now I use FRAPS to record a raw screencapture and then toss that into NixxQuality's Webm converter which is an amazing tool that I use for tons of short videos like this.

I haven't watch this video yet, but is there a way to UIText from another script on another object? I figured a way, but I wanna know if there's a better one.  The way I did it is have two scripts. Script SendText is attached to the object that's my trigger or event. ShowText script is attached to my Canvas Text. Then I basically send the text from SendText to ShowText and it'll work. But, is there a way to just make SendText target the UI Text object and change the .text component without the script being attached to the same object?"
Unity2D,3d6ccy,17waldth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:37:23 2015 UTC,"It probably flips because of friction between the two surfaces creates a torque as you move back and forth. You could try upping the angularDrag on the rigidbody2d, but its hard to say what will work without knowing when you do want it to rotate. Another option is to check 'fixed angles' and spin the block manually when you need it to rotate.  If the penetration is really a problem, you may have to mess with the Physics2D settings: http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Physics2DManager.html  Keep in mind that upping these values will increase CPU usage. Consider carefully whether or not those pixels overlapping is really a big deal or not."

Unity2D,3d6ccy,SacrificeMe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:30:30 2015 UTC,Only way I know how to fix the rotation is to either Freeze Rotation if your v5 or it's fixed rotation I believe in v4. That's all under the RigidBody2D options. Then in the code turn it off and on when needed.Then figure a way to make the rotation back to zero.
Unity2D,3d6ccy,SacrificeMe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:52:48 2015 UTC,"Though /u/Harabeck is right. If you have no friction and don't freeze the rotation it wont spin. But, if you add friction it will cause it to spin. So, either freeze rotation and turn it off and on. Or, add zero friction into the materials."
Unity2D,3d6ccy,Khael8,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:56:44 2015 UTC,It needs to rotate but not when moving side to side on a flat surface if that makes sense. It's hard to explain
Unity2D,3d6ccy,unitor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:51:14 2015 UTC,"Like, the Impossible game? Then either reduce the friction so it won't flip while moving on another surface that has friction, or you can do something like this. Where you turn it off and on. Of course you might want to restrict it a bit more."

Similar to the above, when Naked Snake calls his support team, they will decide that Snake is the winner by default, although Snake feels that he had disappointed The End by failing to face him before his death.

Unity2D,3d5fyf,OnAStick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:30:42 2015 UTC,Step 1: create saving mechanism (or just use PlayerPrefs)  Step 2: have a variable that stores current time (DateTime.Now - or something along the lines)  Step 3: save said variable in PlayerPrefs when you quit the game - OnApplicationQuit (although i'd save it whenver i save progress in my game since OnApplicationQuit is somewhat unreliable if you ask me)  Step 4: Subtract in Start function (any Start function) aforementioned variable from DateTime.now. You can extract the amount of seconds from that result. That amount of secodns is the emount of time your application was off.

Unity2D,3d3ize,brutang,2,Mon Jul 13 10:31:37 2015 UTC,"The short answer, yes. We have considered a stamina trait but have removed it for the time being.   The long answer, in our previous prototype we attempted to use a system that utilized stat points such as stamina, power, speed, etc. We quickly realized that the game was all about number crunching and became a balancing nightmare. We've decided that for this prototype, we'd do away with all of the stats and take a very minimalist approach to the game, which also matches the art style. Think Rock em Sock em Robots meets tug o war. We wanted to start the game out on a level playing field so that each player is equally matched and has the same chances of winning a match. This allows the rules of a match and the strategy of winning very easy to understand. Again, with a minimalist approach in mind, we want this game to be very easy and fun to play. Having said all of that, we haven't completely ruled out traits such as stamina, it can definitely be useful and something tells me we'll sneak it back into the game at a later time.  Thanks for the comment, we'll be sure to keep the updates coming."

Unity2D,3d335p,Smokeswaytoomuch,6,Mon Jul 13 03:23:52 2015 UTC,"Preface: I'm oversimplifying some of this; please correct me if I'm wrong or have anything to add!  I'm not sure there's a ""better"" or ""worse"" in these sorts of scenarios. I think it comes down to code design patterns and personal preference/style, and what is suitable for the required task.   There are probably 3 ways you could initially set this up:  public int gold = 0; //could then do GameManager.gold += 123;   OR  public int gold = 0; public void addToGold(int amount) {     gold += amount; } //could then do GameManager.addToGold(123);   OR  private int _gold = 0;  public int gold {      get { return _gold; }     set { _gold = value; } } //could then do GameManager.gold += 123;   Nothing is ""bad"" about any of those, but option 2 and 3 could potentially be beneficial by lowering the maintenance/change barrier if you need to modify/extend behaviour down the track.  For example, say we want to limit someone to having only 100 gold.  With the first option you'd probably have to start to do something along the lines of:  GameManager.gold += 123; if (GameManager.gold > 100) {     GameManager.gold = 100; }   Not the best if you have many places that can increase the gold value...  With option 2 & 3 you can just extend the function or getter/setter, and any game logic adding gold wouldn't need more work. It'd be something more like:  public int gold = 0; public void addToGold(int amount) {     gold += amount;     if (gold > 100) {         gold = 100;     } } //could still do GameManager.addToGold(123);   OR  private int _gold = 0;  public int gold {      get { return _gold; }     set {         _gold = value;         if (_gold > 100) {             _gold = 100;         }     } } //could still do GameManager.gold += 123;   If you needed some kind of event framework down the track you could add them in to the function or setter as well...  I generally use getter/setter in scenarios such as this because I prefer the notion of keeping code relevant to what I'm dealing with.   That is, gold would be a getter/setter because it's an amount of something, similar to health or armor. Then I would use functions for more complex behaviour such as Hit(hittingWeapon) because that could then affect health, armor, trigger animations, etc, etc.  As far as code compilation goes, I don't really know if one option is more performant than another for my original examples, but even if there was a performance difference it's probably small enough not to worry about."
Unity2D,3d335p,pocketninja,2,Mon Jul 13 04:29:05 2015 UTC,"perfect explanantion, thanks so much... It's tough to know sometimes when you are mostly self taught and trying to make sure that you keep your code clean and future proof.

Unity2D,3d335p,zeelar,3,Mon Jul 13 04:32:51 2015 UTC,"It depends on whether you want the variable ""gold"" to be public or private.  In theory, other objects could modify a public variable so if you want to make sure that only the GameManager modifies the ""gold"" variable, its better to keep the variable private, but have functions to modify it."
Unity2D,3d335p,Zarokima,2,Mon Jul 13 04:00:11 2015 UTC,"I am unsure whether or not it ""Needs"" to be private or public... at the moment it's public as many different things add to it's value, but it got me thinking that this game is getting larger and larger and I wonder if either way offers an improvement in speed or performance issues later on.  Is it better to have the gold variable as private?"
Unity2D,3d335p,tejon,3,Mon Jul 13 04:07:59 2015 UTC,"If you're only ever adding or subtracting values, then there's effectively no difference between the two. But what if you don't want gold to go below 0? Or what if you want to put a cap on gold you can have at one time? What if you want some kind of notification popup whenever your gold value changes? Handling those scenarios (and any other special case you might think of) is much easier if you're using an add and subtract functions, because you only have to modify your code in the one relevant function, rather than trying to handle it everywhere you're modifying the value. This ease of modification is why a private variable with public modifier methods is generally considered better practice than just making the variable public."
Unity2D,3d335p,Zarokima,2,Mon Jul 13 04:39:38 2015 UTC,"yeah i agree exactly what i was thinking, However Unity makes it so easy to accidentally start making everything public as testing is good when you can just change the variables in the inspector, But getting there.

And to be honest, I've had that happen a few times before too and it turned out to be a bug in the physics system. Are you using AddForce() to move your character?    If you're using the physics system to move your character around, you may want to constrain all of the rigid body stuff. It'll prevent random physics events from doing weird stuff. Especially if you constrain the rotation.    Alternatively you can use the transform.Translate() method and see if that works.

You can still store a Vector2 into a Vector3 because the definition for Vector2 contains implicit casts (you can actually see that in visual studio by using ""Go to Definition"" on Vector2).

Unity2D,3cx51x,benetha619,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:38:20 2015 UTC,"One of the first projects I made in Unity was a 2D snake game. Basically just a snake made up a series of sprites that all trail one after the other and the player guides the snake thru a maze (also there's enemies and other stuff). At least in my case I didn't use physics so I set the rigidbody component to kinematic (I needed it cause I used colliders). Point is I don't think you need hingejoints just to have one segment follow another. For me anyway I found the simplest way was to just to have the player control the first or head segment and keep an array of that segment's positions. Then the trailing segments positions were set by reading from that array. So for example the second segment's position was set to the 5th element in the array, the 3rd segment's position was set the the 10th element and so on. One thing about using this method to keep in mind is if you want to keep the segment spacing even you'll have to use either fixedupdate or Time.fixedtime in the snake movement loop."

It requires a whole other layer of code to be added in most cases--if you ever want to reuse the card you have on the field in your hand later, you would have to have another script re-add the Draggable script to your card.   It's also a bit more expensive of a task.  However if you're set on removing the script and/or don't have a plan to reuse your card placed on the field in your hand, the code you'd want to use would be as follows:   Destroy(GetComponent(DraggableScript));   Where DraggableScript is the script you have for Draggable objects."

Unity2D,3coeki,iamallamaa,2,Thu Jul 9 21:52:33 2015 UTC,"The small script under that video is referencing rigidbody. That is one of those properties that are no longer available in U5. You need to use GetComponent<Rigidbody>() to get the rigidbody (which should likely be a Rigidbody2d if you are working with sprites, but for this example it is using a 3d rigidbody). Also, GetComponent is an expensive call performance wise. So ideally you would cache that call in Start to a private/public property. If you are only using the value once or twice though (like this script does) then GetComponent by itself would be fine (as in you wouldn't want to use it in an update function).  So replace:  rigidbody.velocity = transform.forward * speed;   with:  GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity = transform.forward * speed;   Just curious, but are you getting any errors in the console? Perhaps it is not open because you should be seeing something related to that value not existing. You can open it under the window menu and it should show an error in red."

Unity2D,3coxfy,SnakeRy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:29:07 2015 UTC,"having a single game object for every tile is incredibly inefficient. The point of using something like Tiled2Unity (aside from it's easy importing) is that it combines all those tiles into a single game object. Each game object in game has several methods/functions that need to run every single frame. For example if you have a 100x100 map of tiles with one component on each tile with an update function, that is now 10,000 update functions that need to be called in the span of 16.6 milliseconds (one frame). Ideally you would use a collision layer (doesn't require physics to use it) and set that up as an additional layer in your Tiled map. Draw in the places that you can't walk with a tile that is like 30% alpha red (can be anything, just easy to see in Tiled like that). Tiled2Unity will generate a polygon collider that encompasses all the places you can't walk. Then in your game you can use that to determine walkable/not whether using raycasting or physics is up to you. I suggest looking at /u/kreaol's zelda FAT for a good example that does use rigidbody physics but only for the movement."
Unity2D,3coxfy,iamallamaa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:39:21 2015 UTC,Why not just allow each of the tiles that need collision to use the 2d box collider? If you don't want any special physics just don't add rigid bodies to anything. And if there is every any issue with having too many objects in the scene then only render and update what the camera can see. Good luck :)

Unity2D,3ckikr,iamallamaa,3,Wed Jul 8 18:22:18 2015 UTC,Seeing this makes me wonder are you calculating a full path up front or are you moving in that general direction until you can't move anymore and then calculating a path. Or possibly your heuristic is just favoring diagonal movement or even the method you use to find neighbors favors that lie in the general direction of the destination and so in this example the diagonal is the first path followed. I ask because the standard outcome is to move on the horizontal/vertical until you can move diagonal around the obstacle. Just in my experience (which has been a few years).
Unity2D,3ckikr,Eilai,2,Wed Jul 8 18:51:43 2015 UTC,The full path is being calculated upfront. It is preferring diagonal in most cases because of the heuristic. Moving up then right would cost 2 while just moving diagonal would cost around the square root of 2 or 1.4.

This should automatically layer new sprites over the top of the other ones although you may need to add a small change per-tile to the z-depth depending on how Unity handles two sprites at the same z-depth on the same layer  In your example image, the one on the right would be drawn first, then the one on the left as you draw the furthest from the camera first.

Likewise, Game Character Hub seems like it would be ideal if you intended to make an RPG Maker-esq game in Unity.  Although the asset packs are intended for GameGuru and RPG Maker, I would expect that you could also convert and use them in Unity.  Stencyl I've used before.

It will allow your UIs to be more re-usable and sharable.   It really shines if you are presenting dynamic data in your UI, such as lists or collections (levels, quests, inventory, etc). It's easier to create generic content views (windows, etc) that can be re-used. It's easier to create UIs that respond to changes in layout. Theming is a big thing - change appearance, configurations, etc. across all your UIs by changing a single file.   In general MVVM is an architectural pattern that every developer should learn to utilize. It's intuitive and easy to use. Its advantages is apparent even for small UIs and it scales very well with big projects."

The track itself is one picture is divided into 100 lines which in itself move individually much like the mountains that gives the illusion of a curved track. The player does not even control the car but in reality the motion of the image or rather the intensity of the curve motion.

Collision, obviously, force based movement, and interpolation (Collisions are updated in the Fixed Update time, but graphically, they're updated in the Update time).  If you're using transform to move an object, I don't think you get anything out of rigidbody (for outgoing collisions), though while your object is not moving, it may still process incoming collisions.  Not sure if using velocity directly is bad, but combining it with AddForce might get a bit unwieldy, so I'd imagine sticking to one or the other should be fine.  In both cases, rigidbody should be taking care of the movement/update."

There are a lot of complaints about the stuff Unity's physics system (and rigidbodies) is missing, but it's a nice option without rolling your own : )  As for directly using velocity, I'm sure there are some well informed explanations around (not likely on reddit), but it is extremely common to use it in at least one common scenario.  Bouncing collisions, like reversing the x/y or z of the velocity to simulate bouncing off a wall.  Some of that can also be achieved by setting a custom physics material, but I'm not sure all of this is documented that well/fully."

I did look into it more, and directly manipulating a rigidbody's velocity (in 2D, at least) is incredibly common.  One thread I read (UnityAnswers, I think) said that modifying a rigidbody's velocity in 3D can cause unrealistic/unintended behavior, but the 3D physics engine is totally different than 2D, so I'll just assume the best for now ;)"
Unity2D,3cgae1,unitor,3,Wed Jul 8 01:39:42 2015 UTC,"If you're using a collider to detect the projectile's collision, then rigidbody is the way to go. Moving a collider without a rigidbody invokes a high overhead (though it used to be much worse in past versions of Unity).  Setting the velocity directly is fine if you're just firing it. Setting the velocity every frame or as the object interacts in collisions will cause strange behavior.  If your projectile is only going to move in a straight line and it's very small, you might consider just moving a sprite and using raycasting to see if it passed through anything that frame."

But honestly they are worth every penny for at least the ""basics"" up front.   My main apprehension is bringing someone outside my real life circle into the project   I would HIGHLY recommend contacting some other well-known small studios and get their take/tips on bringing outside people in on your project for the first time. I understand the apprehension perfectly: I have brought people in for assistance with, say, creating a logo, but nothing specific to my project(s) at this point.   What I'd like to do is hire someone that has experience polishing up combat and working with enemy AI. We have some good ideas as to what to do with the AI and combat but lack the resources to give it the final push   How often have you browsed a Kickstarter, hoping to find a demo of the game? Even if you do this today, I can assure you that most funder's don't expect a demo but DO expect a good looking trailer. What ultimately drives a funder to provide backing to a no-name game and/or no-name studio is the first 30 seconds of your trailer. Rather then providing a demo, my personal recommendation is to focus all resources into making an outstanding trailer FIRST, and outstanding Kickstarter page second, and finally a good looking website. You're kickstarter would more likely be a success if you focus on your and your games image prior to anything else.  When do you plan to go live with your kickstarter?

I agree we should spend some time on our website as well, so we'll work on that in the meantime - thanks. Our priorities: new trailer, working demo (revamped AI/combat), kickstarter, website. Our goal with the demo is to provide a bit of assurance with potential backers that we do have a real, tangible game that just needs some more funding and time to really bring together that they can actually get their hands on. Trailers can bring a lot to the table, but they can also be faked or use content/scripted events that don't even exist in the real game. That's our thought, anyways, but I definitely appreciate your feedback!  Our goal is kickstarter when the demo is ready, which at this point is a few weeks out after the AI/combat systems are polished up and whatnot.

Unity2D,3cefu9,Kinths,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:48:10 2015 UTC,"The way you ""should"" be doing it totally depends on your animation style:  Frame-Based: Animation is performed via a sprite sheet composed of completed body movements (think Zelda, Contra, etc). To perform a ""crouch"", you attach multiple colliders to your player game object, and turn on the next correctly sized collider for the next step of the animation while turning off the previous collider.  Bone/Segmented Based: Animation is performed via a rigged body composed of multiple body parts. To perform a ""crouch"", you animate the root points of the bones/segments, which in turn animates the colliders automatically.  These are but two ways to do things. Technically you could attempt to adjust the collider's Offset in tandem with the collider's Size, but you may still get some stuttering."

Unity2D,3cfgci,TheGoldenLobster,4,Tue Jul 7 14:29:50 2015 UTC,"This is because Vector2 is a class ""type"".  What you are doing here is creating a new ""instance"" of this class and then using that instance as the player transform's position vector.  For a better example, lets say we defined an ""Hammer"" class.  This is a collective description of all of the properties and behaviours of the hammer: materials[], swing(), etc.  However, in order to actually use a hammer, I would have to use this description to create an instance of the hammer, as the type information is not useful when trying to actually build something.  When creating a new instance of any class in C#, you will usually need to use the ""new"" keyword. That being said, you can still use Vector2 (without the ""new"" keyword) if you are either using a prototypical Vector2 (Vector2.unit(), Vector2.up()) as the class definition comes with functions for returning/creating these, but if you want to create one where you are defining the co-ordinates manually, that ""new"" keyword will be required."

I was confused on the third level when I would beat the goal but would fail to beat the monster in the back. I took a screen shot: http://imgur.com/0RzfruL - I personally didn't notice the monster was a thing until later in the game.  Couple quick questions: -Will the converter orb only change others to yellow?    -Will all the birds / other animals allow special abilities?  I see the green one does vertical, the yellow does converter, and the red does the horizontal.  Otherwise, Keep up the good work!"

Switch ""UI Scale Mode"" from ""Constant Pixel Size"" to ""Scale With Screen Size."" Set your ""Reference Resolution"" to the ideal resolution you want your game to be run at (from my experience too big is better than too small). You'll have to re-arrange your UI elements a bit after doing this initially. Ideally with the screen size being set you shouldn't need to do best fit for text, you should just be able to set a font size and it'll scale properly. Not sure what's causing this? Scaling up instead of using font size?"

What seems to cause the biggest performance issue is the number of GameObjects active in the scene. Depending on how many hex pieces you want, you might be able to get away with individually placing them. I've found around 200 tiles not to cause any problems, though I don't know how many you can have before performance issues start. This might be the easiest to implement, and works well for smaller games.  The other option is to have a single texture used. Sometimes this is generated with code, so you make one big image from all the small tile images. This is much much better performance wise, but only really needs to be done if you are making random maps. If you don't need it generated, you can just make it in photoshop and import the image in. Because the resulting image only requires one gameobject, it runs much faster.  You will need to make some sort of hex-grid system no matter what you use. If you are less interested in the coding, and just want to get to making a game, you can find a some hex-engines on the asset store you could likely use.  Hope that helped!"

Something like [terrible example code ahead] if [ HexTile = Grass      spawn 'Food Sigil'      allow 'Worker' to 'Create Farm' ]  Something like this could probably work, and again, thats terrible coding, but I was thinking I could code it so that I could pick what each hexagon does in the editor. That would honestly make it easier.  My game would certainly have ALOT of objects in it - Hexes (not too many if one img file), hex sigils and tons of wall objects, house objects, and people. So I guess the best way to handle that would be to simply code it so only certain parts of the level load at once? That seems to be what a high majority of even current-gen large games do."

However I would be surprised if your game was actually so big it needed it. Something the size of Wesnoth really wouldn't need that kind of loading.  You will likely end up making a sort of data structure to keep track of data to go with the tiles. For instance, you might use a 3d array to keep track of all the data. So hex[0,0,0] might contain a 'hex' object that has things like a type enum, and if workers can create farms, etc.  I don't know how familiar you are with coding, but if you are new I might recommend starting a bit smaller.

The way I overcame it (after about 900 google searches) was to implement a sort of simple raycasting system that basically checks if there is anything between the last frames position and the current frames position - if the ray hits, there should have been a collision, so you can move the object to the correct position and fire off any appropriate code.  Not sure of the exact code as I don't have it open at the moment, but it should be something along the lines of this (in the Update function):  RaycastHit2D hit = Physics2D.Linecast(previousPosition, transform.position, *layermask if you have one*); if(hit) {     transform.position = hit.point; // moves the object to the collision point     //fire off any additional collision code you have, or stop movement or whatever }  previousPosition = transform.Position;   This should detect 99ish percent (maybe) of any collisions that get missed due to high speeds, as it fires on every frame.

The easiest way would be:   setup a camera and draw whatever you need using GL methods alternatively use the Graphics class or if all you have are hexes just stick some meshes in front of the camera with appropriate materials at this point, you should have your scene laid out and the camera displaying exactly what you want minus the blur render the camera to a RenderTexture next apply a blur to the rendered texture either on the CPU or GPU (doesn't really matter since your only doing it once) and your done.

Unity2D,3bzg4m,IronArthur,5,Fri Jul 3 11:52:03 2015 UTC,"Generating a large mesh and applying a dynamic texture is generally much faster than generating thousands of gameobjects/sprites at runtime.   I went through the very same problem when working on procedural terrain generation, which went through three iterations:   Creating a grid of 100x100 tile sprite gameobjects for each chunk. This was very easy, but the game juddered significantly whenever a new chunk was created. Creating a mesh, creating a quad for each 'tile' within that mesh, and then creating and applying a brand new texture to that that mesh to make it look tiled. This was slightly faster, but because it was creating a brand new texture each time, it was still causing performance issues. The final iteration: creating and pooling meshes with a quad for each tile. Then, instead of creating a new texture each time a chunk was generated or moved, I used an Atlas and UV mapped the tile coordinates dynamically to the mesh. This was 100% faster, and no longer results in any performance drops. I can have my player move at incredible speeds in one direction, generating/re-texturing maybe 50 chunks per second, and my FPS and memory stay stable. Definitely the correct route to take!   Hope this helped :)"

Unity2D,3bw9xg,OhGreyFox,2,Thu Jul 2 17:53:30 2015 UTC,"I don't personally see multiple cameras as a bad decision. The only other options would be multiple scenes (you had load time concerns) or multiple canvases (could have some other problems or not work if you're not using sprites). If it's working fine for you so far, I wouldn't overly worry about it.  Static methods are generally frowned upon, but they do have their uses. Without a better idea of what data you're passing and what other functions are being called between the two it would be hard to say if there's a way to decrease your coupling. If all you're doing is calling one function in the game manager that passes everything to the battle manager for further processing then, without moving that data to a separate data class, there would be no real way to cut down any further. You may want to look at what's called the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern, I find it fits nicely with how Unity is designed.  By turn based do you mean: He goes then I go; repeat. Or do you mean more like Final Fantasy where you have an ""attack"" bar that fills up, and when it's full it's your turn? If it's the first, then you can just drop using the update method to control the flow of battle. Basically, have a function that sets up your battle and one that calls for the next battle turn. Check which players turn it is and call the function that handles their turn. At the end of those function, have it change a variable that controls whose turn it is and then call the next turn function again. Repeat until the battle is over.  If it's the other one, then you'll need to use the update method to control the time and check if it's time to be someone's turn. If you want the turns to be blocking (ie. whomever's bar filled first has infinite time to choose their attack) then have a variable that skips updating everyone elses time until they've made a decision. If you're not blocking, then just keep updating and have the function that handles the units turn reset their timer when it's done.  Just my two cents. Let me know if something doesn't make sense.  Cheers"
Unity2D,3bw9xg,mcimolin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:34:24 2015 UTC,"I'm going to stick with multiple cameras I think. It seems appropriate and that way I can easily modify battle scenes depending on the level the player is on. With that said, I was also thinking of having ui canvas elements tied to the specific cameras so if that works how I'm imagining it, it'll make things easy to maintain!  In regards to MVC architecture, I'm very familiar with it (web development background) but because its not being enforced for me I'm actually struggling to maintain it. Do you have any advice or resources to recommend? I've been using Game managers and similar objects as the controllers and the views and modals are really just the game objects that make up the level (player, pickups etc). Does that seem right?

I've done it that way a few times and it usually works quite nicely.  The thing about MVC that a lot of people forget is the global data class. If there is information that you're looking to be passing between multiple controllers, then this data should be stored in it's own separate model class that the controllers can then update and the view can draw from. With Unity I find it gets a bit tricky as it's really designed to disperse the MVC so that each object is taking care of itself. Again, like I said, if you're only calling a few functions it's probably not the end of the world, but if you have a similar problem to artizens_nash's, then you may want to either look at refactoring or live with it as a design decision."

Have blocks know their row/col and translate that to a position in world space. (You can also use this work backwards, getting a row/col from a transform.)

Mine is more like small hand-designed puzzles. And instead of swapping two gems you just click to remove one.

There are a few things he did that I didn't like and did differently, but it's a good tutorial and he provides the source on github as well.   EDIT: Also, regarding your point A, on the tutorial being for 2D. This one is, but it really shouldn't make any difference. You need to think of the grid and the gems in it in abstract terms. They are represented by a 2D array and all the logic is performed on that array and the gems (like a Gem.cs class or something) inside it. The visuals are completely abstracted away from the logic and should be handled separately. In my game I am using sprites that I load through a script that gets them from a resources folder, but I could easily change this to use 3D models or get sprites from a prefab or whatever and it wouldn't affect the rest of the game at all. All my animations for the gems moving are being handled through a tween library (I'm using prime31's zestkit), so that won't break if I change the visuals either.

Unity2D,3bx6qt,Unity245,10,Thu Jul 2 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree.  Visual novels are traditionally 2D, and their entire purpose is story telling.  With the proper project management, and good artists/animators, you could make fully animated 2D cut-scenes complete with voice overs and lip-sync.  Even if you're using pixel art for your core gameplay, you can have high res images for your dialog moments. Castlevania is another example of this. (Example)  Good animation and sound design are really what makes story telling immersive. Look no farther than the entire genre of animation known as 'Anime' for a prime example of many complex and emotionally gripping stories.. done purely in 2D.  Of course, we live in a 3D world. Well done animation and sound design in 3D is going to be better than the same calibur of animation and sound design in 2D. But I would easily argue that good animation and sound design in 2D can tell a story better than poor animation and sound design in 3D.  The Banner Saga is a prime example of well done 2D in a recent title. The gameplay itself is faux 2.5D isometric, while all of the actual character animations and story scenes are done with traditional 2D animation. Bastion was the same way. Not a polygon to be seen.  As is true with most forms of Art, it is rarely the medium that limits the artist, but rather the artist's capacity for that medium. Thousands of people have made films, but there are only a handful of truly great film makers."
Unity2D,3bx6qt,Clockw0rk,2,Thu Jul 2 23:54:15 2015 UTC,Excellent point. I guess I phrased my question incorrectly. I guess my real interest lies in how to make an immersive 2d story rather than whether it is possible or not.

Unity2D,3bx6qt,Harabeck,5,Fri Jul 3 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"Immersion and storytelling aren't the same thing. Which one are you interested in?

Unity2D,3bx6qt,pupbutt,5,Fri Jul 3 04:02:50 2015 UTC,Your example is hardly linked to 2D.  Text and voice acted dialogue are commonly found in both 2D and 3D media.  It's largely a combination of style choice and available resources.
Unity2D,3bx6qt,AssembledVS,3,Fri Jul 3 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"I think that it is arguable whether 2D hinders immersion. One can make the argument that 2D is less descriptive than 3D, which forces the player to use their imagination more. 2D limits what the player can see, but at the same time, increases what a player may imagine. For example, in a 2D game like Zelda: A Link to The Past, you may be left wondering what is behind a certain house. In most 3D games, you can just go and take a look. Because 2D limits what the player sees, there is always a degree of mystery about what is happening in a corner that cannot be seen."

In limbo, it's not the animation that drives the ability to pull the character up on a ledge or pull an object with a handle: It's the player's direct interaction of pressing a key/button, which creates an event, which then allows the controller to do something.   The animation is just an effect that occurs when the event kicks off. You could easily leave a comment that says ""//hands grab handle here"", and move on to the rest of your controller. Your game WILL (not ""may"") drastically change as you create it, so worrying about dynamic-sprites/animations/etc will only lead you to scrapping the game and wasting a whole load of time.  Make the game fun. Then make it pretty."
Unity2D,3bvasr,GuideZ,-2,Thu Jul 2 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"Hi FrozenImlosion,  I don't want to sound like a jerk, but ""I'm new to X"" and ""but I'm pretty confident about Y"" sounds a lot like dunning-kruger effect.  It is perfectly possible to make animations like Limbo in Unity. It's all quality of sprites, because animation and cropping tools in Unity is pretty much easy and great. For bone structure, you can take a look at Asset Store which have many plugins that does that for you.  Therefore, it is not a very complex thing to do, but I'd suggest you to start with a Mario clone to get familiar with Unity2D tools and workflow.  PS. Note that developers of Limbo use Unity to make their new game."
Unity2D,3bvasr,Tanshaydar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:08:46 2015 UTC,"By new I just meant that I have not worked with it for very long, I have already completed around 12 hours of tutorials on Lynda.com. I have already made a Mario clone with jumping, double jumping, wall slide, wall jump, power ups that introduce fireball powers, running, etc.   My question is not whether it is possible to do. I am asking whether there is a way to make animations change dynamically in scripting. I just want to be able to push/pull an object while also changing the animation depending on the type of object. Surely this wouldn't necessitate creating a different animation for each object, so I am wondering how one would go about this sort of dynamic animation."
Unity2D,3bvasr,Tanshaydar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:30:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, you are asking for procedural animation. I misunderstood, sorry.  Procedural animation is a little tricky, but of course possible. Unity lets you access many components via script.  Right now for my 3D game I'm writing an interaction system. The way I implemented it, when player decides to interact with something, object of interaction decides which kind of interaction will be (open close, drag, pull push, rotate, pickup etc...). You may want to follow that kind of way maybe.  But in the end, procedural animation will need different body parts to be connected via body joints and bones. You may want to check out advanced 2D tools in Asset Store and their documentations."

This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude. Conversely, highly skilled individuals tend to underestimate their relative competence, erroneously assuming that tasks that are easy for them are also easy for others.

Unity2D,3bvtsw,mrsuperbad,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:49:44 2015 UTC,"I recommend not using uGUI to do this, as it will cause all sorts of camera issues in the long run.   2D: Use a white square sprite. Scale it to the size rectangle you want, and shade it to high health color. Place it over the sprite in question (can use sprite bounds * local or lossy scale if you need the boundaries) Via a script change the width as health decreases and the tint color. Make it a prefab and add a script that pops it over the mob's head or put it in your mob prefabs.  3D: You may use the 2D method again since all 2D objects can work with 3D. For a ""pure 3d"" solution. Use a white square texture, and set it to ""Point"" filtering. Create a material that uses the square and an unlit shader that allows you to set its color (if you don't have one you can make one very quickly in ShaderForge, or find one online). Again, scale the quad to be a rectangle.   Create a script that scales it and shades it based on current health of the mob. Also in the script add a reference for a ""camera"" in the LateUpdate function orient the quad so it is facing the camera (transform.LookAt).   If you would like all health bars to be uniform size then scale them based on the distance from the camera. If you would like health bars to not be occluded by other objects use a second camera that just renders the health bars. (you can also use this second camera as a orthographic camera to keep health bars as a single size). If you go 2 camera be sure to set the health bars to a different layer and tell the existing camera to not render that layer while the healthbar camera renders only that layer.  As was before prefab this and either add it to your existing mob prefabs or add it at runtime.  reminder: do not use this.transform in an update. instead store a reference for the transform for speed reasons  You can use a second shaded rectangle as the ""background"" if you want to have a background for your health bar"
Unity2D,3bvtsw,buddingmonkey,2,Thu Jul 2 17:20:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with this answer. Basically, just directly add the UI image I'm assuming you're using for the health bar as a child of your enemy sprite instead of adding an extra canvas.

I'm not very experienced with Unity either, I've only been attempting as a hobby for the past couple months so forgive me if I'm horribly wrong.  But I think what you would need to do is have 2 cameras, set the ""main"" camera's culling mask to every layer except the layer you will use to display the clear menu when paused. Then set the second camera to ONLY that layer in the culling mask. You will also set it to Depth Only, and I believe you need to set the depth level as well so that it renders over the top of the other camera.   Now with this set up, you would probably make this secondary ""pause"" camera a child of the main camera. Apply the blur filter to the main camera. In code you would activate this on pause, so that only the elements on that layer/layers that you can view through the second camera would be clear.   I hope this helps."

I used to roll my own using a rigidbody2D and MovePosition(), but could never get consistent behavior around slopes. My character would get stuck randomly, and I had to resort to all sorts of weird behaviors, like slightly hovering the character above the ground and things like that. After discovering your series, I decided to completely revamp my platforming physics and follow your method since the controls are so much tighter and consistent.  Though, I currently have a problem not covered in your tutorial, and would like to pick your brain a bit if that's alright. It has to do with box collider size changes resulting in collision with walls. It seems when that happens, the player gets put in a bad state, and they can walk through walls. In my particular example, the character to be able to duck and roll. It's possible they can roll into a nook or cranny, and then when they stand their boxcollider clips through a ceiling. That's when the bugs happen.  I'm wondering if you have any solutions for recovering from this. One solution I tried was to check the hitbox change and detect if there is an obstruction (using Physics2D.OverlapArea). Then if there was an obstruction, to keep on waiting until the next frame, until the frame occurred where enough space was available to change hitbox without collision. However, this didn't work well, since the character stands too close to the ground, and Physics2D.OverlapArea would get too many false positives. So now I'm stumped. Would really appreciate your thoughts on this."
Unity2D,3bqmsz,GreyToad,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:45:57 2015 UTC,"Hi, I would recommend using vertical raycasts instead of OverlapArea to do this check (compare hit.distance to how much you need your bounds to grow vertically).

Go with SDL if you want to start from scratch and spend time doing back end stuff before you get to the actual game development. Both are valid paths, just depends on what you want."
Unity2D,3bqv9n,Harabeck,2,Wed Jul 1 14:03:27 2015 UTC,"You're kind of asking for opposite things:  ""Is Unity well-suited for a turn-based, tiled game"" implies Unity has some API for these features, while ""I like to do everything myself"" implies you want to write it yourself.   Since I can't answer an ambiguous question, here are the facts:    Unity does not have any API for a turn-based system.  Unity does not have any support for a tilemap system (though, there is one in development).  You can write both of these yourself, or find assets on the Unity Asset Store that do it (both are very common problems) You would have to write both of them yourself in SDL. You would also have to write many other low-level engine features in SDL yourself that Unity gives you for free ( the 'game loop', resource/asset managers, occlusion/frustom culling, rendering code)    P.S: The distinction between ""low-level"" and ""high-level"" programming, in the context of games, is basically this: low-level is writing code that is generic to any game (import a sprite, process input, render a mesh, play a sound, deploy to Android), while high-level is writing code for a specific game (shooting this guy subtracts 10 health, moving into this area opens that door, this NPC will give the player Quest X)"
Unity2D,3bqv9n,nostyleguy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:00:12 2015 UTC,"Hi Owlbear89;  I'll talk from my experience. I am a Unity developer, I have been working on both 3D and 2D games with Unity. I love Unity, I love how it makes things easy, but at the same time I hate being forced to play by the book (book of Unity) and in order to overcome this, I had to write my own pipelines and editor extensions.  Now, a close friend of mine, also a member of my development team ( /u/aecepoglu ), does not really like Unity nor does he like to work on Windows. In order to test AI systems he wrote, he built his own top down engine with C and SDL. It is an open source project, so I'm sharing his repo: https://bitbucket.org/aecepoglu/aecs-top-down-game-engine (he'd really love if you'd see it :D). Due to contract restrictions, I cannot share my 2D codes for Unity, but there are tons of example out there.  Now, in past I used C++ and SDL, and over the course of years, I came to realization that I'm a high level programmer, I do not like low level, and given the chance, I'd keep my code high level. Aecepoglu turned out to be a low level programmer, he does not like high level, and given the chance, he'd keep his code low level. We interchange positions so I write low level, he writes high level from time to time.  In the end, it is a matter of choice. No one can say that one is definitely better than the other.

Unity2D,3bqv9n,michaelltn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:23:10 2015 UTC,"In programming, ""level height"" is used to describe how far away you are from the commands being issued to the processor.  For a game made in Unity, it looks something like this:   C# scripts use the UnityEngine API Unity's engine is written in c++ which makes use of libraries such as DirectX or OpenGL DirectX exposes the functionality of the graphics card, sound card, input system, and so on   High Level programmers may prefer Unity because they write gameplay logic and don't care as much about how a character is animated and rendered, and prefer to just focus on the conditions that trigger that state.  Low Level programmers want to define exactly how that character is animated and rendered.  Flexibility has a cost, and low level programmers tend to prefer to minimize that cost.  Some simply prefer knowing exactly how everything works and sometimes it's just easier to build it yourself than try to deconstruct someone else's solution."

If it is, set a variable and attach the object to the Touch Position (during move/drag).  On Touch Up, you check the Touch Position, and if it is applicable, you place the object there.

Unity2D,3bii7l,audiolook,7,Mon Jun 29 14:35:08 2015 UTC,"As someone that works on localization for several console games (as high as the 100k word range in some cases), I thought I would give people some advice.  a) You do NOT want to fall back to English in the case of a missing translation. This is because it isn't always obvious now when that English word you see on screen is actually coming from the English language files or if it's actually from your other language files. English is becoming surprisingly acceptable in other languages and regions to the point that ""ON"" and ""OFF"" are considered acceptable in France. So when you see ""ON"" in your game text, is it coming from English, French, or is it actually a string that hasn't been run through the localization system and is hardcoded? You have no way to tell if your localization system falls back to English by default.  b) Create a simple localization debug function that will automatically prefix all localized text with a short and unique  string that you wouldn't normally use in your text. For instance, something like $#$. When you want to debug your localization stuff, if you see a string start with $#$, you'll know for sure that it has properly gone through the localizer and isn't just hardcoded.  c) Make sure that any localization routine you write can handle Unicode and dual-byte characters. You never ever know when you might decide that you need to release in the CJK languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean). Even EFIGS (English, French, Italian, German, Spanish) requires an odd encoding for French (used for the combined OE character most often seen in the word coeur). Having everything set up properly beforehand just in case you may decide to localize in other languages will save you a lot of time later on.  d) If you are using Excel, be aware of certain special character sequences that may have other meanings to Excel than intended. I don't remember what these are offhand but I do remember there being potential issues with single quotes requiring them to be properly escaped for them to be usable.  e) Before you write a single line of forward-facing text the user will read, make sure you disable the Smart Quotes feature of all the Microsoft Office products and anything that you will be using to write game text. Office likes to replace straight quotation marks with curly quotes, and this is bad because that's a different character under the hood. And those characters usually are not properly supported, especially on consoles. Every single game I've worked on over the last ten years has had at least a few crashes because of these unsupported characters so nip them in the bud by disabling smart quotes and auto replace. Make sure that anyone that touches any of your code or text does so as well, including anyone working on translations!  f) Try to make sure no hardcoded english text is ever used in the game at any point. Set up your localization solution as early as you can, prove it out and use it immediately. It is far far better to make sure no string ever makes it into the game untranslated from the start than it is to try searching through every single instance of every single word to make sure it's not hardcoded.  g) When possible, try to send the game itself with your localization to your localizers. It will help them understand the context of your strings and allow them to give you a far better translation. In the case where you cannot provide them with images or the game itself so that they can see the context, you'll want to write a small little blurb explaining exactly how the string is intended to be used.

He has a box collider for his body and circle collider for his head. I thought I might have a corner of the box collider sticking out that was hanging on the edge of the platform collider, but zooming in on the scene window, that doesn't seem to be the case. It looks like the circle collider is sticking to the side of the platform sprite's box collider.  The platform's box collider has is using Slippery (from Standard Assets, 2D, PhysicsMaterials) for a Material. That's Friction = 0, Bounciness = 0. Both of the characters colliders have None for Material. Should I be using some different values here?  *Edit: Just tried changing the character's collider Materials to Slippery as well, but he still gets stuck."

It is quite expensive considering it has just been released and has no reviews and as a small indie I am not sure I would cash out that amount without having some security (ie existing reviews etc).  Also:  1 - Does it work on iOS and Android?  2 - Does it generate much garbage for the Garbage Collector (GC) to pick up?  3 - In general does it perform well for mobile, as I would use it for lists of items, level selects, HUD items in game and it must not be slow.  4 - Am I limited to the views you have provided? Can I make my own controls (ie a slider) and integrate well?  Overall it looks like a great project!"
Unity2D,3bizmh,boxhacker,2,Mon Jun 29 18:35:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. The cost was in the lower end (similar products being around $50-100) considering the size of the extension, but I can see how people may hesitate seeing as there are no rating / reviews yet. I've been handing out some free copies to people who were subscribed to my announcement list, perhaps someone will come back with a review.  Proving the worth of the framework is tricky - I'm thinking about taking on a challenge were I'll create UI widgets requested by the community. It might open people's eyes on its power and ease of use.  As for your questions.  1 - It works on all platforms  2 - No. Most of the UI is generated during compile-time.   3 - I expect it to perform similar to UI's created using only unity 4.6 as it builds on it and doesn't add much in terms of extra draw-calls. I've done most tests on android and windows phone and I've not seen any performance issues. That said there might be perfomance issues that I've overlooked - if any issues comes up I will provide updates and bug-fixes to the framework.  4 - You can create your own views - it's designed for you to create your own views and it will integrate as well the views provided - as they are not given any special treatment by the framework.   I'm considering uploading sample code how the slider is implemented for those who are interested."

Unity2D,3bjqs1,Keith90,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:02:33 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you want the gameobject to be public so you can access it from another script?  An unfortunate feature of Unity is that public variables can be serialized and modified from the inspector. This is cool for tweaking script behavior at runtime, but it means that those public variables don't change when they're changed by code at runtime; they stay whatever is serialized in the inspector.  There are 2 similar solutions to your problem:    Make it a C# property that is backed by a private variable   or    Simply make the variable private, assign it like you do now, and have a 'getter' function that returns the variable   i.e:  class YourClass : MonoBehavior {   private GameObject objectInMyTrigger;    void OnTriggerEnter(Collider col ){      objectInMyTrigger= col.gameObject;   }   public GameObject GetObjectInMyTrigger(){      return objectInMyTrigger;  } }"

So I'm excited to try your methods out.  Thank you for your input and time. I really appreciate it. I'll let you know how it goes.  Thanks,  -- Keith  Edit: I have a question. I have an object already assigned by using the inspector, if I make it private then I'd have to add the object in through code.

Unity2D,3bhb6j,mogey51,4,Mon Jun 29 05:36:25 2015 UTC,"Given that you have complete control over the creation of your tiles and they don't move, any sort of Raycasting or collision detection solution is a pretty bad idea for something like this (Raycasting is extremely expensive compared to your alternatives here).  You really want a solution where you're actively managing your tiles so that it's very easy to look up or manipulate a tile at a specific location.  Generally you want an overall world script that will store a 2d array of all your tiles where the two indices of your array specify the location:  In a WorldGrid.cs:  GameObject [,] tiles = new GameObject[worldColumns, worldRows];  GameObject CreateTile(Vector2 position, GameObject prefab) {     int x = (int)(position.x / tileWidth);     int y = (int)(position.y / tileHeight);      tiles[x, y] = (GameObject)GameObject.Instantiate(prefab);     return tiles[x, y]; }  GameObject GetTile(int x, int y) {     return tiles[x, y]; }  GameObject GetTileAtPos(Vector2 position) {     int x = (int)(position.x / tileWidth);     int y = (int)(position.y / tileHeight);      return GetTile(x, y); }   This example has been overly simplified for ease of understanding.  Generally you want to return some sort of WorldTile behaviour instead of the GameObject, and that you'll want to parent the newly created tile to the world for a better scene graph."

While the Hashset is a short term solution the 2d arrays would give us more control. Thanks again!
Unity2D,3bhb6j,weltraumaffe,2,Mon Jun 29 23:56:04 2015 UTC,Just an idea: Use a Dictionary. Where the key is the hash of the coordinates (or a Coord struct). As the value use the tile you are usint at this location. Lookups in Dictionaries are O(1).
Unity2D,3bhnmi,friicis,2,Mon Jun 29 08:25:13 2015 UTC,"nice question..   So my first guess would be there is a couple ways you could do this.  You could either store all the buttons that get pressed into an array then just plays the button presses back...   But if the level is moving unsure how they would work..  Or you could store the position of the character and add it to an array every frame or second using transform.position.  as for the shadow concept you could just change the opacity fo your character, but depending on how your character is made if it's just a single sprite you could edit it, or animations you could prob change the opacity with a script.  Sorry i know you probably wanted more but without seeing your script, or knowing how your capturing the key presses now and how your character is made really makes a difference.  Hope this is enough to get you started."
Unity2D,3bhnmi,llamarama1st,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:38:47 2015 UTC,"Well i was giving this a thought. So level would be measured in distance, and according to distance enemies/obstacles would be spawned. So the level can be probably saved by distance and position where enemy/obstacle was spawned in that specific distance. As for player just on fixed update register position."
Unity2D,3bhnmi,llamarama1st,2,Mon Jun 29 09:58:00 2015 UTC,Sounds like your on your way. If you get stuck with something specific just make a post and we'll try to help
Unity2D,3bgzl0,1UpBox,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:32:32 2015 UTC,"Well, the current way you have it setup it will find the first object with the tag. So no matter how many objects you have with this script on, they all will be referencing the same object.   There's a really simple way to get around this. You can make goalA and goalB public and set them in the properties panel.  It can be done cleaner,  but that should get you up and running.  I could be misunderstanding what you are asking as well."

Unity2D,3bfob2,MrReynevan2,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:27:18 2015 UTC,Take inspiration from Ren'Py. Take a look at what they did right or wrong and improve upon it.  I don't think ProcessNode() should be a co-routine. It's not CPU intensive or threaded and you're forcing it to wait until the end of a frame anyway.  To control text speed use a cumulative counter of Time.DeltaTime.
Unity2D,3bfob2,-Wire-,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:40:41 2015 UTC,"Good point. Thanks for the tips.  I used Ren'py for a while, but I'm aiming for Windows Store & Phone right now, so Ren'Py won't be of much use.    To control text speed used a cumulative counter of Time.DeltaTime.   Can you show an example? What should I use if I just want to delay an execution? From what I can tell, Unity doesn't support .NET4.5, thus async&await won't work... or will it?"

This solved almost every problem I had when it came to the camera following my character, including particle stuttering and movement.  Because you're moving the particle Group of particles in update, this could fix the problem.  Now, setting interpolation on your main rigidibody may cause other issues with other objects that use physics."

Unity2D,3bfffy,Make7,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:14:53 2015 UTC,"So just to be clear, both of those OnTriggerEnter scripts are attached to the player? And the problem is that the bottom one is happening when the player touches an enemy, instead of just the top one?  If so, this could possibly be fixed with a simple bool. If the bottom should only happen when attacking, inside the OnTriggerEnter function, you could wrap the code in an if statement:   if(attacking) { //check tag and do attack code }   And you would turn the 'attacking' bool to true when you wanted to detect an attack, and to false when the player is not attacking.   Alternatively, you could add a separate child gameobject to the player with its own trigger collider, and attach the second script to that one. Then you could just activate and deactivate that child's collider whenever you wanted it to detect attacks."

Unity2D,3bfstp,Sir_Justin,3,Sun Jun 28 21:04:18 2015 UTC,I had the same issue. In the end I just set up my player object structure like:  PlayerObject ---sprite ---hp bar  It required a small change to my code. Position was handled by the parent object and I flipped the sprite as appropriate. The hp bar was independent of the sprite so it was always facing correctly. IMO it was easier than coding to flip it and it makes it a bit more modular.
Unity2D,3bfstp,IronCarp,3,Sun Jun 28 22:55:24 2015 UTC,Same thing I was going to suggest. Make the health bar and player model sibling objects in a master object. Then just flip the player model when turned around but actually move the master object.
Unity2D,3bfstp,Wisteso,2,Mon Jun 29 02:54:21 2015 UTC,"Is this line of code in the Update?  That would explain why you can't put it back in the inspector.  If that's the case, one simple solution would be to set the scale to ""-1"" for the HP bar immediately after you set it for the whole player.  I've recently run into a similar problem, but I arranged my character this like:  + Character   + Model   + NameText   When I want to flip the character, I only change the Character/Model and not Character or Character/NameText."

Which is not what I'm after.    It kinda is, actually. Generating a dungeon means placing objects, such as rooms, enemies and traps with certain parameters so that the whole thing is playable and makes some sort of sense. A platforming level has different parameters, but it's the same overall process.  You need to decide what characteristics you want your levels to have and figure out a way to make that happen. The needs of your game are probably unique, so even if you do find something close to copy, you'll need to modify it.  First step is deciding what your level needs to look like in terms of platform and object placement. For instance, you probably need to make sure the player can reach the exit or goal(s)."

Put in that piece, and go down to the bottom. Repeat until the level is done.  Then you can go back and throw objects and platforms and things on top of it, similar methodology.

Stuff like coins/collectibles placed out of reach. What similar game are you trying to emulate with this? I ask because ""place platforms and objects randomly"" is pretty broad. There are several different platform style games and each would likely be a little different to generate. I mean you could use a simple maze generation algorithm, use the horizontal walls as floor/ceiling and the vertical walls as side walls and let the player jump through that meat boy style. Some algorithms favor walls in a specific direction as well (such as horizontal)."

Here you have an official series that explains a lot of different parts about the Unity editor. A lot of nifty hints and tricks. After you are done with the beginner series you can start on the intermediate one.  Object pooling is something that is nice to learn. It becomes really useful if you have a lot of objects that are repeatedly used and drawn to the screen.

Unity2D,3b7zuv,Dhinanta,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:55:22 2015 UTC,Well I want one damage texture for all sprites.  The method you suggest would need unique damage textures for every sprite.
Unity2D,3b7zuv,Dhinanta,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:25:17 2015 UTC,As an example here's how it used to be done in 3d: http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shader-NormalDecal.html
Unity2D,3b7nqa,io-error,4,Fri Jun 26 17:03:34 2015 UTC,Regarding your UI problem:  Canvas elements are drawn by hierarchy. Objects higher up in the hierarchy are drawn in the background and vice versa. Here is an example.  Here is how you can change the order at runtime.
Unity2D,3b7nqa,WoolViking,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"I'm still a Unity noob, but in my work developing 2D games so far, I have run into some interesting 'layer' issues.  Remember that even when you're using Unity for 2D, it is a 3D native engine. That means that you have to think about X, Y, and Z; even though you're almost exclusively using X and Y for most things.  I ran into an issue when programming a camera to follow my character, because the tutorial I was using instructed me to follow the character transform on Vector 3. Since it mapped Z directly, this snapped my camera to the same depth that my stage was on and I could see nothing but background when the game was playing.  I quickly learned that the way things had been arranged in my scene was that the background was Z -1, and my game took place on Z 0.  Long story short! You can use Z depth as layers. So, if you want to send your button behind another object as in your example, you'd need your 'object' to be on Z 0 (for example) and the button residing on Z 1. When the button is interacted with, you can use an animation or script to send the button to Z -1, thus sending it behind Z 0.  Does that make sense?  I could be wrong, by all means correct me if I am, I'm still learning too."
Unity2D,3b7nqa,Clockw0rk,2,Fri Jun 26 17:37:09 2015 UTC,"When it comes to non-ui items in game, ""sorting order in layer"" will take precedence over z-index, but items drawn on the same sort order you can use z-index to set the layers.  For UI items, they have a rect transform that only has X and Y, no Z. In those situations, you need to use the hierarchy. Items are drawn from top to bottom in the hierarchy where items drawn before are drawn behind items drawn later."
Unity2D,3b7nqa,iamallamaa,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:49:06 2015 UTC,"For your layering problem, if you're not using the new GUI system, you can layer 2D sprites based on their Z position. It's a bit annoying, but it makes a lot of sense if you're moving to Unity 2D stuff from 3D.  For example, if you have a top-down 2D game, setting every sprite's Z position to be the same as their own Y position will keep everything properly assorted according to their anchor point."

With this you can call functions so basically what you do is you create a function which will have animator.SetBool(""Attack"", false); in it and maybe animator.SetBool(""RUN"", true); or whatever you want to do after the attack.   There are alot of different ways to achieve the same thing but i been recently using this method :)  EDIT: also you might need to turn off the attack animation LOOP you do this by clicking on your saved animation and uncheck LOOP.

Unity2D,3b67uo,NullxPhantom,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:55:43 2015 UTC,"animation controllers have a few different parameters you can use - you are using bools for now. Triggers are another option. Triggers are a bit like bools - when you set a trigger, it is changed to ""true"".  The difference here is important: when a trigger causes an animation to transition, it is ""consumed"" and is immediately set to false.  This should simplify things for you, as you don't have to worry about setting things to false.  The default animation controller for a button is just an example of an animation controller you can look at and potentially copy as it should work well for you"

Unity2D,3b3n2c,Kinoxciv,2,Thu Jun 25 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"Unity will automatically scale it during run-time based on the size of your sprite. For example: You put a 1000x1000 pixel image inside a 100x100 sprite the texture will be scaled to fit inside that 100x100. Vice versa, 100x100 image into a 1000x1000 sprite will be scaled way up (and probably look blurry) to fit inside the sprite.  I should add however that if all of your images are going to be of such a large size that you scale them down in photoshop (or similar) to the maximum resolution that they will be displayed as.   Example: You have a 1000x1000 image, but the biggest sprite that you ever use is 256x256. Reduce the image down to 256x256 to save on in game memory."

Unity2D,3b0xn0,nostyleguy,3,Thu Jun 25 02:28:58 2015 UTC,"The symbols themselves are just called ""angle brackets"" but they signify that a method or class in C# is a 'generic'.  A generic is a generalized blueprint for functionality, but you must provide a 'generic parameter type' within the angled brackets so the compiler knows what specific object you are using.   The most common example is from the System.Collections.Generic namespace, which allows you to define things like List<MyType>, Dictionary<string, MyType>, etc. In these cases, the container generic knows how to do all the List and Dictionary operations ( Insert, Remove, Find, etc ), without caring about the details of what a ""MyType"" object is. It saves having us to all write our own type-specific containers; ie MyTypeList, MyTypeDictionary, etc.  In your case, ""GetComponent"" is actually implmented by Unity in 2 different ways:   Once as a non-generic function with 1 string parameter; GetComponent(""TypeName""),  that uses (I'm assuming) C#'s reflection features to figure out what type of object you're requesting.   and also   As a generic function with no parameters; GetComponent<Type>(), which uses the generic type parameter to know what type of object you're requesting   If the angled brackets don't scare you off, I think the generic version is better practice, because it isn't susceptible to typos in string literals like the non-generic function is. The compiler will tell you that GetComponent<MyTypo'dType> isn't valid, but not GetComponent(""MyTypo'dType"")"

Unity2D,3ax272,1UpBox,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:31:02 2015 UTC,You should be able to change the paddle speed in the options so you can adjust it to whatever feels comfortable.
Unity2D,3ax272,badson100,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:15:56 2015 UTC,Played the web version and like it.  If there is a full screen option would love to be able to move the paddle with the mouse.
Unity2D,3ax272,nostyleguy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:33:39 2015 UTC,"Overall, the game is really polished and fun.  Pros:    The sound effects are effective; the one for the 'invincible' blocks definitely communicates the invincibility to the player immediately.  The gameplay 'feels' good. It has the right amount of feedback and reaction. The UI, overall, is fitting and pretty.    Cons:    I'm not sure why I need to hit 'apply' on the options menu. Seems like a confusing button; just assume I want any options I change to take effect While I appreciate the option, I'm not sure users should be able to change the paddle speed. Paddle speed is an important variable in your difficulty equation. If I tune it down so I can actually control the paddle precisely, then I create situations where I can't possibly get to the ball in time.    I think a better solution would be to lock the speed to 1 constant (for fairness), but add some momentum/acceleration to the paddle so it moved more like humans expect an object to move. As it is now, at highspeed, players will have trouble controlling the paddle, even though they have plenty of time, because they're not used to objects accelerating to full speed, and stopping, instantaneously.  I can hit 'space' to reset my ball, but this doesn't cause me to lose a life. Therefore, I'm just going to hit space anytime the ball starts to seem out of reach.    Worse, I can just constantly reset the ball whenever I need to, to line up the shot on any given target. This removes the whole strategy of playing angles and removes the skill of finally hitting that last, isolated, hard-to-get target.    Overall, very nice for a first game. Congrats :)"
Unity2D,3ax272,Smokeswaytoomuch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:38:21 2015 UTC,"Great feedback and many thanks!  You nailed it with paddle acceleration/deceleration. That is  the detail which i think I have been trying to find to make paddle control feel right.  Yes, hitting space to relock the ball is a bug. I have fixed it already but i did not make the fix public because i was curious if anyone would notice. It makes me happy that someone did :D"
Unity2D,3ax272,Smokeswaytoomuch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:26:17 2015 UTC,"Nice game, Sounds, Ui, graphics all good.  Suggestions:  Remove ability to change speed of paddle, This is a core mechanic and should be only affected by power ups (Or power downs)  does the ball have it's own gravity? I find sometimes it just starts falling back down and it only hit the side wall?  The coins should not stop the ball, maybe make them a trigger rather than a collider?  Other than that, good job on your first game.  I think a Brick breaker clone is a right of passage most Unity Devs should go through."

Unity2D,3awrta,SacrificeMe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:58:29 2015 UTC,Yes. I don't know know how I missed that. But it's still not working. Redid the script.  http://pastebin.com/yWrQAC52  I also tried to hold the button down while the projectile reached its target while using the older script. Nothing :(
Unity2D,3awrta,TheShmoJoe,2,Wed Jun 24 04:25:25 2015 UTC,"Have you considered breaking up the code for the destroying the object onto a separate script on the prefab?? What I think may be the problem, is that it keeps updating the mouse's position over and over. I'm not quite sure if this will help but it is an idea. Also it might be worth noting that if you give the bullet a little wiggle room with the destruction call. Physics might be having an issue with maybe gravity or friction? I'm not sure. You definitely want to get the   if (missilePosition == target)  out of the call for shoot button."

Unity2D,3awrta,OIIOIIOI,2,Wed Jun 24 05:56:55 2015 UTC,Try Destroy(gameObject) instead of Destroy(projectile)? Maybe your destroying the reference to that object instead of the object itself.

Unity2D,3awrta,OIIOIIOI,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:32:09 2015 UTC,I am sure they match. I made it move at a snails pace. Console shows both the positions matching. But nothing happens.
Unity2D,3awrta,SacrificeMe,2,Wed Jun 24 06:34:26 2015 UTC,I think OI is right. I just matched them down to the .001 and the code worked. What I did to more it work better is round. The code worked for me: http://pastebin.com/bSBtqTJn.  More specifically if you remove the rounding part and just do player.transform.position == transform.position then change the object's position to the target's position the code will work because it's exactly on top of each other.

Unity2D,3avw24,Applzor,2,Wed Jun 24 06:31:31 2015 UTC,well it does technically make sense if you read it just as code. you're getting the negative of the right vector and getting the negative of any vector will give you a vector that points in the opposite direction. so the negative of the right would be left.

Obviously in windowed mode any resolution smaller than the screen's native size should be supported, but the system likely doesn't tell Unity that those are available and so Unity doesn't list them. If you read the manual on Screen.resolutions it even says:   All fullscreen resolutions supported by the monitor   However, you could also disable that dialog and set a resolution through code using Screen.setResolution."

Now depending on what the question is, when you click a button, you should have something to compare that button's value to. If they match, correct! If not, incorrect.

You're wanting script B to find object X and destroy it.  I'd start by thinking about it differently.  Script A instantiates object X then tells Script B that it happened.  First you gotta make sure script A knows about script B, and then that it can tell script B when object X is instantiated. Finally script B can do whatever the hell it wants with object X.  Basically in script A have a reference to script B.  private ScriptName scriptB;   Where ScriptName is the name of the class you want to reference. You can make it public and assign in the inspector if you want, but I've also found something like below useful:  scriptB = GameObject.Find(""SpecificGameObject"").GetComponent<ScriptName>();   Where ""SpecificGameObject"" is a designated object with the specific ScriptName class that you want. Keeping variables private keeps the inspector free of clutter.    So script A now knows about script B. Awesome. Next is to make script B able to know which GameObject it should be looking at.  Declare a GameObject:  private GameObject pointOfInterest;   And a simple method in Script B which Script A can call upon:  public void SetInterest(GameObject i) { pointOfInterest = i; }   Script A can then tell script B which object was instantiated after instantiation:  newSpawnThis = (GameObject)Instantiate(Enemy_First); scriptB.SetInterest(newSpawnThis);   And now you can do whatever the hell you want with newSpawnThis in Script B! Woo!"

Unity2D,3arnwg,theBigDaddio,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:37:46 2015 UTC,"oh man you want me to just write your game for you?   You will use the vector you get from the stick to instantiate your projectile with the correct orientation and heading. Then you treat it like anything else moving. the stick no longer matters. That info is on your projectile. Have you done some tutorials like the ones on the Unity site under Learn?  There are multiple ways to deal with what you are asking, one is the vector is nothing more than a heading and does not effect speed in any way shape or form.  You can also normalize the vector (do a google for normalize vector in unity). Another approach is like this:  _rightVector.x = System.Math.Sign(Input.GetAxis(""Horizontal2"")); _rightVector.y = System.Math.Sign(Input.GetAxis(""Vertical2""));   this will make the result -1, 0, or 1, again google it and learn, sign is a .Net method."

If I find similar assets, I always jot down their current feature set, and compare my idea to ensure what I'm bringing to the table is something the others don't.  Nothing sucks more then making an awesome 2D Tile Mapper, only to find out someone has a cheaper/better/vetted alternative already on the asset store."

Most tweening libraries interpolate between the current position the the goal position over a period of time, all with one function call.  It will animate your collisions, too, if attached to your object.  Unity's animation system is even more powerful, allowing you to animate any field in any behavior and to call functions.  You can use it to modify the shape of your colliders if necessary.  I use iTween to change a single variable (typically rotation or position).

So i was playing using the webplayer, this means anytime i right click i also got the right click context menu popping up over the game. I ended up dying a couple of times trying to get the menu to go away again.  Having that switch on the mouse also felt weird because i started off using the arrow keys to move, so that meant i needed to move my hand to the mouse to switch depths. I quickly figured out that A and D also move the character so i could leave my hand on the mouse but that still felt weird somehow.  Lastly, once i figure out the controls, i still kept dying from depth switches because it requires pretty precise timing, which itself isn't a bad thing, but having that level of difficulty right out of the gate was a bit discouraging. Maybe having a platform the player can stand on which doesnt switch depths would help. That would give the player a chance to play with and understand the depth switch without losing lives.

I don't want all loot dropping from all mobs so most mobs have less than 10 different items it drops,  So i just check if random.value is under 0.05 and then the next item might check if its over 0.05 but under 0.07 which might be a 2% drop etc etc. just make sure it all adds up and it should work."

It seems like a lot of effort to get it right but the end result drastically cut the field of actors I needed down by a crazy amount, and fixed the slowdowns and stuttering that would occur once there were dozens of objects on screen (because of thousands of objects off-screen).

Unity2D,3a83gy,dylanwolf,2,Thu Jun 18 02:44:07 2015 UTC,"I did something similar, but to make it easier I created by game objects with a size of 1 and put them into a two-dimensional array where the transform X and Y values mapped directly to the array so the object in array slot [0,0] was positioned at (0,0,0), [1,0] @ (1,0,0) and so on. This meant that the only calculation I had to do was positioning the camera in the middle based on the largest X and Y values so that I could dynamically change the number of rows and columns. I then changed each array value to a List<T> and was able to add custom properties to each of the array entries, such as the game object/prefab, the texture/colour to apply and so on so each of my squares could be fully customised whilst not massively increasing the memory usage  After doing that I optimised further by creating a 1x1 plane for the backdrop and the using screen to world space to add objects to a grid when you click on a virtual square; this meant that I didn't need to maintain a tile for each square, just the ones that actually had something in it, but this would clearly be overkill for most use cases, although it enabled me to have much more efficient memory usage for very large numbers of tiles, particularly by only displaying/enabling the objects that were within the camera frustrum and those small way outside  Edit: I should say that my solution was based on creating a large-scale, block-based city builder game for mobile so optimisation was a driving force. A lot of the objects were static prefabs to allow for batching and so on as most of them would be static once placed.

Unity2D,3a7k58,cynap,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:05:02 2015 UTC,If you're using BoxCollider2D your triggerEnter needs to be   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D col) {}   Then make sure you have a rigidbody2d with kinematic == true and boxcollider2d is trigger == false on your player. Then make sure your pickup item has a boxcollider2d and is trigger is true. Also inside your OnTriggerEnter the if statement does not make sense!

Unity2D,3a36cd,kreaol,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:31:04 2015 UTC,"Here is one that is really simple, but can offer some big bang for the buck. A Minimap. You can see a gif of it working here.  For the demo, I used /u/kreaol's zelda prototype he made for fap #8. For this to work you need to be able to use render textures (Unity 4 requires pro, Unity 5 you can use personal or pro).  The basic gist is to add a camera and have it render to a render texture. Then set the new camera size to really large so it appears zoomed out (you can adjust this later). Then you can add a Raw Image to a UI canvas and set the render texture as the image texture.  You can also play with layers to render different stuff to the minimap such as a red square for the player or enemies. Add a square sprite as a child of the player/mob. Set it's layer to a new one called ""Minimap"" and then adjust the camera's culling mask to not show the player but do show the minimap layer. Then adjust the main camera to not show the minimap layer. Then just add anything you wan't shown on the minimap (icons, whatever) to the minimap layer and it will be seen there, but by the main camera.  Project available here."

Unity2D,3a36cd,iamallamaa,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:28:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed about the camera. I'm sure there might some some other way to just draw a dot and move it around scaled down to an image or whatever, but the camera is just so easy to use.  And since the minimap falls under the UI (it's just a raw image), I just made a circle frame image and a slightly smaller mask image with the render texture under that. They could be a little better by combining them into a single texture and/or PoT, but I was just doing it quick."

Unity2D,3a2hs9,ShoganShongololo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:58:39 2015 UTC,"A bit difficult to say from your description but it sounds like you are working against the 2D system in Unity3D.  You should try to keep things on the same Z-axis, but use physics layers to separate your object collisions. Essentially you want to have different entities on different layers, and use the 2D layer collision matrix to define what can collide with what.  This way you work with the 2D system and can define the collision interactions with the matrix. If an object on a layer moves past another object on another layer and you have set these two layers to ignore collisions then your trigger will not fire.  Hope that helps!"

What is it doing to interact with ""pusher""? Is it moving on its own to one of the color lines to change, or is it static and changes color over time? Or perhaps the user is dragging the circle to the color boxes?   This would be best if you broke it up so each object is handling their respective job:   White circle has a script to handle him changing color and setting his tag (OnTriggerEnter2D should work fine since you're just setting values and not constantly checking) Clickable boxes handle the logic that sends information to the GameManager (E.G <click red box> print""HE CLICKED THE RED BOX!"")

If so, try panning and zooming the camera...! :)  Seriously though, you should be able to script this by changing the camera's look-at position relative to the movement of the camera, possibly using lerp to smooth out the transitions from moving to stopped and stopped to moving. If it's an orthographic camera then moving in the x/y plane should be enough without needing to move the look-at point (unless I am mistaken)  For zooming just changing the FOV setting should work well enough for non-orthographic cameras or change the orthographicSize parameter value for orthographic cameras"

Unity2D,39zlq1,cynap,3,Tue Jun 16 03:07:18 2015 UTC,"Multiply the movement by a certain amount, like:  rb.AddForce(movement * moveSpeed);   Where movespeed is a float. Try increasing it to say 10 or 20."
Unity2D,39zlq1,Randommook,3,Tue Jun 16 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"Input.GetAxis(""Horizontal"") returns 1 if you press right and -1 if you press left and 0 if you press nothing.  So when you press right moveHorizontal gets set to a value of 1. If you press UP as well then moveVertical gets set to a value of 1.  This results in a movement value of (1, 1)  You then apply a force in the direction of (1,1)  The reason the box does not move is that a force of magnitude 1 in the X direction is tiny and cannot overcome friction and a force of magnitude 1 in the Y direction is even smaller and can't even come close to the force of -9.8 that gravity is exerting on your box.  You have 4 ways of fixing this problem.  Option #1: Make your forces bigger. This will get your box to move and overcome the forces of friction and gravity. Just create a value called movementSpeed or something and multiply moveHorizontal by movementSpeed when you create your movement Vector.  Option #2: Lower your box's mass. This will make your box require less force to move it around (Remember you are using Physics to move the box and light stuff is easier to push than heavy stuff).  Option #3: Remove friction and lower gravity. Your box will still move as slow as hell but at least you will be able to move it.  Option #4: Don't use physics to move the box and directly change it's velocity or position."
Unity2D,39zlq1,coffeetablesculpture,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:30:01 2015 UTC,"I think what cynap is saying is that your floats (moveHorizontal and moveVertical) are being set to either 1 or -1 by the number returned by the getAxis function. This means that you are also applying a force of 1 or -1, which is presumably not large enough to move your box. I would suggest multiplying the moveDirection vector by some scalar so that you can get a force large enough to move the box."
Unity2D,39zlq1,SacrificeMe,0,Tue Jun 16 03:35:24 2015 UTC,"Input.GetAxis has a sensitivity value attached to it. More here. So, Input.GetAxis (""Vertical"") would return 1 or -1 depending on which way you go. Your cube isn't moving because you're doing movement = (+-1*+-1) = 1. So, you are moving, but at the value of 1 which maybe 0 depending on any phsics material attached to the floor or globally. Just do what Twixmix said and add Input.GetAxis(""Horizontal"") * movementSpeed. Then set movementspeed a higher value."
Unity2D,39zlq1,TWIXMIX,2,Tue Jun 16 03:37:35 2015 UTC,"Try multiplying movement by a high number like 10. GetAxis returns between -1 and 1, so I'm guessing that your floor or character friction is such that your force isn't enough to move your object. You can also try applying a PhysicsMaterial2D to your floor collider with a friction of 0."

Instead of a single ""character"" sprite that you redraw over and over with minor changes, draw each body portion separately (head, torso, left arm, right arm, etc.) and have your in-game character be a collection of objects with SpriteRenderers.  This way, you could change an individual part of a character without having to redraw the entire sprite for every change."

Unity2D,39yv5p,LoungeAbout,3,Tue Jun 16 00:05:44 2015 UTC,"It's great that you seek to structure your code better, but before googling for game design patterns (you'll find an online book), take a moment to sift through your code and spot recurring pieces of code yourself. It may sound a bit daft, and I mean no harm by it, but it's really beneficial to actually notice yourself that patterns emerge from your code and not vice versa. You can make a proper mess by just applying random design patterns because other people use them.   It's much more helpful to spot the exact things that make your current code a mess, and fix them - so that you'll start spotting the situations where mess tends to happen, and then you can evade it beforehand by applying some common patterns. That way you still know what you're doing, and you can use the patterns that you actually need without making your code unnecessarily complicated.  I also recommend reading Casey Muratori's musings on semantic compression. It was a real eye-opener for me. (tl;dr - write your code as verbosely as you need until recurring pieces of code start to emerge. Then make functions out of them. Rinse and repeat.)"

I'm not at home so I can't test, but the code I supplied worked just fine in my test last night. But I just dragged a sprite out and that script. Nothing else. No collider (which shouldn't affect it) or rigidbody. Also, just make sure there isn't any other scripts giving conflicting numbers.

Unity2D,39vwik,realey21,9,Mon Jun 15 05:53:18 2015 UTC,"Well the first one is definitely using things like masks/blending modes.  The second one is just simple geometric shapes, good color choices, and some nice effects animations like the gradient trail and the animating alpha on some of the circles.  What they both have in common is great color design, animation, and simple recognizable geometry. Great animation is subjective but for these games some things that stand out are they're using easing instead of linear tweens, squash/stretch, and things like trails, wind-up, follow-through to convey motion even with simple shapes.   There's a great talk about ""juice"" in games that you might find interesting. There's also this talk about similar things. You could also look into reading abut the 12 principles of animation as some basic research, even though you won't be hand animating this stuff.  As far as doing something similar. It doesn't have to be a 2D primitive, you could just use a sprite (like a .png) of a circle or other shapes. As long as the resolution is high enough it won't seem pixelated. You absolutely do not need some vector or primitive solution, although it might be cool in the future. The animations for things related to gameplay are all handled to some degree through code. That might mean simple state machines (mecanim) or controlling an objects transform through code (moving a player through transform.position and getting the desired squash/stretch through transform.scale for example). You can do the same thing on collisions and have it controlled through the object's velocity (whether you're using physics or you're own movement calculations).  Hope this helps, I didn't look at both games too closely but feel free to ask anything more specific."

You will be accessing a lot of objects and classes, whatever you drag onto your object , it can be accessed with getcomponet and its name, and the names are usually self explanatory. Lets use rigidbody as an example, I dragged it onto my object and now it has a component rigidbody, meaning I can access all of its options via this.gameObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().gravityScale or other variable or method. Once you understand this , It's very easy to continue and just research more components and later on you will be able to mesh them in. Well I probably didn't understood what you were asking but this is what I think, good luck !"

I'm assuming your Walk and Run functions are basically the same with increased  speed values? Or, is it just a movement function where you take in a speed variable parameter?

I'm basically trying to display text in the sky by moving the camera towards it and would like it to return after the text is shown.  I do sort of get how to display text cus I'm also doing a little separate project trying to make a text based game behave sort of like cmd.exe inside another unity project for learning
Unity2D,39mxly,SacrificeMe,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:55:31 2015 UTC,"Not Kreaol, but here's how I'd do it. This would be instead a script on the Camera. Basically have a bool equal true when your camera is following the main object. When you goes to travel towards the text make the bool false.  Use transform.position.x and transform.position.yto keep track of your camera's location when the bool goes from true to false. So, this:  if(camBool == false){  xfloat = transform.position.x; yfloat = transform.position.y; }   Once you have it at the text you use time.deltatime and a float variable. So, this once it's at the text location:  timedelay += time.detlatime;   Now, just use an if statement and pick the number of your delay.  if(timedelay >= 3f){//3f would be a 3 second delay.    From here just do this:  transform.position = new Vector3(xfloat, yfloat,  transform.position.z);   This should reset the camera to the original location to the time where you set the cambool to false. Also, I'm still new as well, so if I made any mistakes or if this doesn't work tell me."

I started on Episode 1 last night, and I am very glad to find a platformer tutorial which does not use the 2D physics for movement.  One thing I am concerned with is ensuring that the movement in the game I want to make is deterministic, so that it is repeatable. This is important for me as I want to include replays that the player can view.  When experimenting with the 2D Physics I found that the movement of the rigidbodies was not even repeatable on my own machine.  Do you think the movement in your platformer tutorial is repeatable? I understand the problem is caused by floating point errors, so do you think rounding the player position to a certain number of decimal places in each update would resolve that?

By default it is set to 100 which is usually a very small image (smaller PPU == bigger image). There is a correct setting for PPU based on your camera size and target resolution. I forget the exact equation but it is something like targetResInPixels / cameraHeight. The resolution is in pixels and the camera is in units. That should figure out how many pixels per unity your game is and you could set your images to that size and they should be like a 1:1 pixel ratio."

I cant seem to get it right but randomly clicking that a few times all over my   animations suddenly plays my character jumping  EDIT: When I spam the spacebar to jump and tick and untick has exit time in   the transitions between idle and jump and walk and jump my character will freak out   and do some really weird glitchy jumping but none of it stays permanently   it just happens when i tick and untick

Also   Here you are doing the same thing three times :   Healthofplayer = GameObject.findwithtag(""Player"");  target = GameObject.FindWithTag(""Player"");  Directer = GameObject.FindWithTag(""Player"");    Target, Directer and Health will be storing the exact same reference. Making two of them redundant. You only need the one.  If Directer and Health of player is working then target should also be working. So long as you want your Target to be the exact same thing as Directer.   Here is a quick rewrite replacing the redundancy with a single GameObject just called player. http://pastebin.com/invGVqyC   What specifically was it about Target that wasn't working?   Also are you trying to access parts of other script? You set them up by setting references to the components then never use them.

Just an idea :)

Note, this was done before Unity introduced their own UI tools, which might be the best way to get what you want.   Use tags for everything - e.g. UI tag for the 'X' button. Using a raycast, get everything under the touch/click. Create an algorithm to figure out what the player intended to hit (e.g. UI is always on top of 'Game Item', so if the raycast hit one of each, the UI is the intended target.   I created a function called 'GetTopTouch', which returns the object hit according to which is 'highest' on the screen based on tag (and some logic specific to my needs). You should be able to structure your tags and logic to always know what the player actually touched."

If you're part of a team: whatever the lead programmer wants.  Generally I use the following rules:   Everything uses camel case because I find them easier to type and read in almost every case. Instance variables, properties, and methods lead with a lower case letter while class (static) variables and methods lead with an upper case letter. Private variables lead with an underscore.  I do this to help differentiate them from properties.   Example:  private object _instance; public object instance {     get { return _instance; }     set { _instance = value; } }  public static void StaticMethod() {} public void instanceMethod() {}   Some conventions use leading upper case letters for properties.  It's nice to differentiate between variables and properties because if it's a property the getter could have significant overhead and you can determine if you should cache the result before using it or if I can just keep referring to it throughout.  The only reason I don't use this is because I don't use complicated getters.  If getting a property requires any work other than wrapping a variable or performing a simple calculation, I use a method instead.  [Edit: formatting]"

Unity2D,39en4c,pupbutt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:25:27 2015 UTC,All objects are local to their environment or parent in space. If you want to pivot something around a specific point you must use a null or a parent to act as a local reference point of which to rotate.
Unity2D,39en4c,pupbutt,-1,Thu Jun 11 07:42:06 2015 UTC,This is about the origin. It has a parent. I want to change the origin. It has a parent. I can't change the parent.

Unity2D,3977ew,Eilai,4,Tue Jun 9 20:27:56 2015 UTC,"As a gamer, I would rather have my laser fire immediately than have a wind-up time. It creates a disconnect between the button press and the attack. I think that's fine in games primarily revolving around melee or close range combat, but in a space shooter (with an assumed futuristic setting) where ships will mostly fire from range, it's much tighter to have weapons fire immediately.   Now, it is possible to have a near instantaneous charge effect that would be a nice touch, but that's something to be considered later once I know there won't be specific ship adjustments. Right now the game is built in a modular way so all ships can be controlled by either player or AI, and all ships can use all weapons."

It could definitely use some more effects though, right now it's just a blue line that fades out, which is a little bland.  Maybe it makes the ship glow blue, or small sparks shoot out of the muzzle when the laser turns on/off.  Little detail effects like that add a lot.  One option for charge-up, would be to have it fire instantaneously as it does now, but let it grow brighter, wider and more powerful the longer you hold it down."

Unity has built in 2DCollider components that are really easy to use. Unity uses AudioSource and AudioListener components for handling audio. They have a SpriteRenderer component and Cameras for handling Rendering of Sprites. They have recently brought out a great UI system that is very versatile full of great components. They have tutorial videos to teach you how to use all these things.   The scripting can be done in javascript or C# but I'd recommend C# because I like C# more and most the community uses it.  You can easily make your own custom components that are a script you add to a gameObject. They have an Update method that happens each frame, FixedUpdate() that happens each physics timestep, OnEnable/OnDisable  which gets called when a component is activated/deactivated. Collision Detection they have a  OnTriggerEnter2D and OnCollisionEnter2D methods which will return hit information.

Rect rect = new Rect(transform.position.x, transform.position.y, transform.localScale.x, transform.localScale.y);   Then you can create a randomized position based on this defined area, and spawn your entity there:  Vector2 posToSpawn = new Vector2(Random.Next(rect.x, rect.x + rect.width),  Random.Next(rect.y, rect.y + rect.height));   Then instantiate your gameObject, and set its position:  GameObject go = Instantiate(Resources.Load(""PrefabName"")) as GameObject;  go.transform.position = posToSpawn;"

Unity2D,395xfb,kreaol,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:15:06 2015 UTC,"Hey! This is the first of these I've taken part in so far, I'll take any break from doing pixel art that presents itself to me ;_;  So this is my system for dynamic amounts/speeds of jumps: http://pastebin.com/7L6QwZTu  It works so that you can set the max jump speed in the editor as well as a speed decrement that will be applied to the jumps after every consecutive multi-jump. For example, if the max speed was 15 and the decrement was 5, the player's initial jump would be 15 velocity, then 10, then 5, and they would then not be able to jump again.  This also uses an IsGrounded() method I ripped from a platformer concept I was working on a week ago. It basically fires raycasts down from the player's transform that are 0.1f longer than the player itself. This basically just checks if there is something underneath the player, and if so, it returns grounded as true. If grounded is true, the player can start the initial jump. If it is not true, they use the diminishing multi-jumps.  It works alright in an example project I tried it in, though it could definitely have some extra features/polishing done on it (its a pretty janky script).  Cheers for the challenge, look forward to seeing what others come up with :)"

Unity2D,395xfb,TheWarPelican,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:37:55 2015 UTC,Hey!   My first time doing weekly challenge.  I'm kinda still new to unity but I gave it a try ( probably the simplest way but the worst also :P ) a good 15 minutes  here is the code:  http://pastebin.com/Hhrf5hxS  You can ajust the velocity you want and the number of times you want the player to jump. At the same time you can add other tags  like walls and more so maybe you want your player or character to be able to jump from those.   I chose to not do a function to check if the character is grounded by casting a ray since I alredy have a function that is called every time a box collider touches an other!   feedback would be appreciated :)

EDIT: i forgot to say that it can't be done in realtime because the methods that can do that are editor only."

Unity2D,3957hd,jongallant,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:55:23 2015 UTC,"no, that's what i suggest you to do. record the frames from the spritesheet and the estimated time between them, in a List of a custom class with that data, and then cache it in a dictionary for fast access. then make a class that extends from monobehaviour and make use of that data. it will be faster than the built in animation system if done well, because it will not have the overhead of the use of animation curves for every component and gameobject, and only will have to deal with sprites changes. look at the video of my plugin to have a better idea of what i'm talking about: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/34067"

Unity2D,392idm,cynap,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:04:55 2015 UTC,"Whenever I'm using a rigidbody for character movement, I generally tie the input to its velocity. This makes it much harder to say, as I've never used AddForce to move the player. Think of FixedUpdate as Update, but applied at a steady rate, rather than framerate dependent. One would assume AddForce would apply the force every tick, so you might not need Time.deltaTime. Sorry I'm not able to answer this for you!"

Unity2D,392idm,cynap,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:11:50 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the kind of game you are trying to make. I personally (though this might not be optimal) use something like this:  Vector3 moveDirection = new Vector3(Input.GetAxis(""Horizontal""), rb.velocity.y, 0); moveSpeed *= Time.deltaTime; rb.velocity = moveDirection * moveSpeed;   Edit: formatting issues."

Unity2D,392idm,Randommook,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:10:27 2015 UTC,"Instead of doing 2 if statements you can just clamp your velocity at the end of every frame to stop it from going above your max speed or below your negative max speed.

Put all vertices of the polygon in an array or list or whatever.  Order them either by X values or Y values.  Then, for each vertex, until you hit the third-to-last one, take it and the next two vertices.  (So if you have five total, 1,2,3 and 2,3,4 and 3,4,5)  Then for each of those triangles, just plug the coordinates into this formula to find the area.  (Ax * (By - Cy) + Bx * (Ay - Cy) + Cx * (Ay - By)) / 2  Where Ax and Ay are the coordinates of the first point, Bx and By are the coordinates of the second point, and Cx and Cy are the third point.

Unity2D,38w04n,Smokeswaytoomuch,5,Sun Jun 7 08:16:54 2015 UTC,"I honestly think you should start making the basics of the game locally first, without involving networking.   You should make one player script and you should create one instance of the player script for each player. The player script will handle the logic for one player.   Secondly you need to make a PlayerManager / GameManager script that will manage the game and your players. This script will contain an array / list of Player scripts. When a player join the game it will be added to this array. The manager script will handle the game state, e.g which players turn it is etc.  When you are done with the local game, try to implement it using unity networking. Check out RPC, it is probably going to be quite straight forward.   To implement asynchronous multiplayer with such a long time-span will be an entirely other beast to tackle. New problem arises such as when a player exit the application, they will disconnect from the server etc. The easiest way to solve this is to use a master server you control and host. One way to do this would be to abandon unity networking completely and instead connect to a php interface (which in turn is connected to a database) through http calls.     There are many ways program this. This is probably how I would do it. Hope it helps a bit."

How do I set an instance of the player script?  So in each player script I can make functions like bet, raise and challenge. And hold a life value doesn't seem hard. But with the player manager what do I call to make it someone's turn?   Do I need to like set a bool for each player called ismyturn then if true show buttons?  Then those buttons depends on what the latest bet was? Then each player should update latest bet?   That's what comes to my head but seems like it's not the easiest way to do it? Any thoughts?   and I shall focus on making it local first thanks. The php way probably seems easier than implementing unity networking as I just need to store a game room in a database then hold an array with the current game states.  Then when player connects get the values from the database."
Unity2D,38w04n,OnAStick,0,Mon Jun 8 00:51:44 2015 UTC,If you don't know how to do that I would recommend taking another step back with basic C# or java. Baby steps are key if you want to succeed.
Unity2D,38w04n,Roy-Fucking-Mustang,-1,Mon Jun 8 01:51:28 2015 UTC,"I understand i need to take baby steps, I think my previous comment shows that i am trying to break it down. Telling me to take a step back isn't helping. If you do not know the answer than you can just not comment, Otherwise your comment adds nothing of value to the post.  I understand how to make a player script, The trouble I am having is how to determine how many players are in the game.  I could create a button that says Choose how many players, Then say the user clicks 2. How does it then create 2 player scripts?  Do i just call like new Player for each player in the array? I am just unsure of the wording or how to handle this? I have google a multitude of things and have not gotten a simple answer. I presume I want to create an instance of the player class for each person that is in the game, and then each player has it's own ""Life"" value. But unsure how to actually write that."

Unity2D,38s0cq,pigsnoutman,2,Sat Jun 6 18:05:00 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you asked! So I initially thought of the shooting mechanic two years ago, and that's when I first started teaching myself how to use Unity. Unity didn't have it's own native 2D tools yet, so I purchased 2D Toolkit and built a prototype with place holder graphics. In the first version you could only shoot one ball, and if you took a shot while one was already in the air, it would disappear lol.  Once Unity's 2D engine released, I rebuilt my game, paid a friend to create most of the background and player art, and the scope of the game began to increase. I had all of these ideas in my mind that I wanted to put into the game, like a two player mode, and didn't have a clear vision of when I would be able to get everything done. This was around May of 2014.  For almost a whole year I took a break from working on the game, but it was always in the back of my mind. Around February after Unity released it's new UI tools, I got back into it again, but I scaled the game way back to it's core mechanic and made sure that the scope never got too big. I kept it pretty simple with the features but I can say that I'm pretty happy with what I was able to release.  All that and the fact that I worked 40 hours a week at my full time job, in addition to other small free lance projects. So I really only had time to work on it during the weekends when I had nothing else going on.  Thanks for checking out the game! I really appreciate it. Be sure to check out the timed mode as well. Good luck on your own game!"

Unity2D,38ox5v,mister-la,5,Fri Jun 5 17:10:36 2015 UTC,"There are two things:   If you want to keep using Unity's physics system, you should probably make your viewport a small resolution and then zoom it (for example, make your whole game 320x240 and then resize that to the screen). I don't have personal experience with this method, but it seems to result in what you want. ""Real"" pixels. If it's your own physics system, or if you dissociate physics and rendering, just round positions as needed. You'll have upscaled pixels on everything before the final rendering instead, I don't know if there's a significant difference in performance."

My understanding is that's what the pixel snap option is for on sprite materials. But I've not messed with it much.

My sound still plays but it loops indefinitely and when the next sound is supposed to play it adds on top if it, creating an annoying looping sound. I've tried to create a stopping condition where it will only play once but things are working out as well as I had hoped. Here is the code I've tried out:  GameObject player; AudioSource sound; bool hasPassed;  // Use this for initialization void Start () {     player = GameObject.Find (""Bird"");     sound = GetComponent<AudioSource> ();     hasPassed = false; }  // Updated code is below here. Above code remains the same.   I'll take a closer look at how audio can be handled in Unity to see if there is a way to stop the infinite looping of my sound clip.  Edit: I've changed up the code a bit and the frequency of each sound is a lot less, but it still loops over and over and overlaps each other. Here are the code fixes:  // Update is called once per frame void Update () {     if (player.transform.position.x > transform.position.x && !hasPassed)         hasPassed = true;     if (hasPassed && !sound.isPlaying) {         sound.Play();         hasPassed = false;     } }   I have removed the passedObstacle() method for now.  Edit 2: Okay, I've thought about it a lot and I think the looping is happening because it is continuously checking:  player.transform.position.x > transform.position.x    The first time, and every other time, it does this will always be true which is why the sound loops over and over. What can I do to make sure it stops after one play and doesn't continue looping?  Edit 3: I've updated the OP."

Unity2D,38p6v8,nostyleguy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:08:59 2015 UTC,So I can't watch the video but from everything else you are saying it seems like you are using collider's And raycasts for collision detection. Why use both?  IMO the raycasting is better. Will link video later. You have ray casts looking for objects in a certain layer. And when you are right next to it stop moving. That's it pretty much.  The collider way is letting unity handle this. By attaching collider's to all your objects and unity should handle the rest. But you get some glitching if the objects move too far in a frame and yatta yatta.   It seems like you are trying to have collider's and then look ahead with raycasting? I would just move over to using ray casting for all collision. Its better than using collider's and you have more control over everything your character does
Unity2D,38p6v8,Crychair,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:21:57 2015 UTC,"I may not have been clear in my OP, but I'm basically using your raycasting suggestion. There are no rigidbodies on any of my objects.  Of course, I need colliders for the raycasts to hit anything, but colliders by themselves don't detect or handle collision in Unity."
Unity2D,38p6v8,Crychair,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:37:46 2015 UTC,Sorry I got ahead of myself haha.  Well. For the interaction you are looking for I would add it to the enemy controller. There you can have on collision.above if tag=player or something along those lines. And then on below switch direction.  Also when you say you have multiple calls destroying an object I dont this this should be a bad thing as long as you are making sure the object exists before you try to delete it.  So  If player != null Delete(player)  Does this help? If not ask more question because maybe I'm missing the point haha.
Unity2D,38p6v8,loofou,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:32:41 2015 UTC,"Not directly related to your problem, but I recommend putting rigidbody components on every nonstatic object with a collider. Unity regards every object with a collider as static and needs to recalculate ALL static colliders when one of them moves. Rigidbodies handle their collider positions themselves. If you don't need physics, just set them on kinematic. Saves you a a lot of optimisation trouble in the future ☺"

Unity2D,38p6v8,Sycobob,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:42:19 2015 UTC,"When it comes to who should handle it, there is no correct answer. It depends on how you make the game.   As an example, in the sims games they store the information on what the sims can do with them in the objects. This mean that they can keep the sims kinda simple while having a lot of simple objects which together form more complicated behavior. They are also able to easily create and add new objects.   Now I don't know how your game works, but I think you can benefit from the same concept with the player - enemy interactions. Let the enemies handle it."
Unity2D,38lap7,Skaffel,5,Thu Jun 4 23:17:07 2015 UTC,Awesome! How did you do it? Can you share the code?
Unity2D,38lap7,Nefius,6,Thu Jun 4 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, its not much code to share. The little that exists is very ugly, I may share it later. However I will be glad to explain the concept.   Use a chain of distance joints where each node in the chain has a rigidbody. The first node (the one attached to the terrain) is set to kinematic.   The problem with this way of making a rope is if you put something heavy on the other end, the rope will stretch out and won't be stable. The standard trick of the trade is to put a new distance joint between the first and the heavy node (in this case the player) which only limit max distance. This will prevent the rope to stretch farther than the length of the entire rope.   Now we have a nice looking rope, but it won't wrap around objects correctly. When a node is colliding, but the others after it can move freely, the rope will stretch usually making the rope go through the collider. To solve this I made an ugly hack.   I use overlap circle for every node to see if it is colliding. If so, I raycast from the node to the hit collider to get the collision normal. I then get the force applied by the distance joint and project it on the collision normal. If the projection is positive, it means the joint is trying to move the node in a direction which is blocked. In this case I set the node to kinematic, and activate a second distance joint which connects with the player, much like the original (first) node, basically creating a new node fixed into the terrain.  For the most part or works fine, but sometimes the rope can feel a bit like it is glued toward a wall. It is not 100% stable, and sometimes do weird things. The mass difference between each node and the player can't be too big  (in the gif this difference is of magnitude 1000). To make it more stable you can increase the physics iterations of course, but that was not needed for the version I made.   Hope it helps!"

If you are doing something like making a clone of the gameplay for an existing game, that time can be reduced quite a lot. Games that take so long to develop often times go through several updates for stuff like the game engine or possibly even changing the game engine when something better comes along. That all takes time.  That being said, if you know nothing about development or programming. You are likely looking at a few years development. You would be better off starting smaller and working your way up to learn programming and game development as you go. New programmers often pick something that ""sounds"" easy but don't realize how much work really goes into making a completed project. They start big and quickly get overwhelmed. Starting out, you could spend a few months working and polishing relatively simple games."

Work your way through some of the tutorials to help you understand the concepts and how Unity works, then start looking for information on how to create each of the component parts for the game  Do you have any c# experience or will you be learning coding from scratch too? If you don't have any at all then it might be a good idea to go through some coding primers first as it will make it a lot easier to understand what example code is doing..."
Unity2D,38n4m2,exeneva,2,Fri Jun 5 08:01:43 2015 UTC,Patrols are likely always going to look somewhat artificial.  An more dynamic way would be to just to have each ship pick a random direction to move in and a distance to move in that direction. Just use Random.range to tweak the distance. Do this a few times and save the end points as variables and then have it go back through them. Rinse repeat. Unless you would rather they just patrol a set area without specifically backtracking in which case you you don't need to store the variables. Just write a bit of code that sets an area around the object and if a path is ever going to leave the area just create a new path in another direction.   The main problem I could see with your game object Idea would be that if two ships spawn near the same one they will both end up on the same path. Though I guess it depends how many ships you are going to have in certain spaces.
Unity2D,38n4m2,Kinths,2,Fri Jun 5 12:50:06 2015 UTC,"Why are they patrolling? What are they protecting? Maybe it will look more lifelike if their patrolling actually have a purpose rather than just randomly going around an area.  Sorry for not having any worthwhile to say really, but I would look at other games / reality and see how actual patrols look like. Then you might get an idea how to generate a path which looks more lifelike."

Unity2D,38kdp9,PixelTaloned,2,Fri Jun 5 03:54:05 2015 UTC,"very excited about this!  i think that it is obvious to try and make some comparisons to esoteric's Spine, which is arguably the upper-end ""standard"" for this sort of animation technique.  would the dev(s) care to explain how this is different/better?  are there enough distinct features for both to co-exist in a development process, or does Creature seek to flatten Spine into dust?  is the deformation mesh pretty much the same thing as Spine's implementation (or better)?  i'll admit, i don't have a license for Spine yet but i was strongly considering a purchase, probably within the next month or so, but now i might be leaning toward Creature because of the vast feature set.  cost is similar, though spine is about $40 pricier.  i found a discussion on esoteric's forum, but would like some ""rebuttal"" from the Creature team (some trash-talk regarding artists that use Creature and the motor system itself) :  http://esotericsoftware.com/forum/Discussion-Creature-vs-Spine-4614"
Unity2D,38kdp9,PixelTaloned,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:30:02 2015 UTC,"Hello! Thanks for your interest in Creature :) Creature is based completely off mesh deformation at the core, even in the Standard version you get a very advanced skinning and mesh system that allows you to deform with bones. In the Pro version you get even more advanced tools of course! Creature's deformation system is a lot more advanced then the standard linear blend skinning and vertex deformations most competitors offer, you can go take a look at the results for yourself if you want :)  In terms of the competition, I do not like to do any trash talking but would rather show results to let you draw your own conclusions.  Allow me to show a couple of videos done by OTK Games who are now using Creature to make their amazing games :)  Check these out:  Zombie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xbUyKofH48  Devil: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8NMdQu-5-U  Succubus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F-ciNM0QWw  These animations were all authored using Creature's advanced Physics and Procedural animation system. In particular, all the flesh animation/dynamics is driven (with user direction) using Creature's motor system.  As such, you end up with very few key knots (actually in many cases, just 1 single knot) which means it is really easy to tweak your animations.  Plus, churning out the animation like the zombie didn't take weeks or days; it literally took 30 mins to get that out of the door.  BTW, Creature does not ""enforce"" the user to use just automated motors; in fact by default every rig is setup for manual FK and IK animation (Yes, I consider IK manual animation as well. There are a myriad of much more advanced animation motors that qualify as ""automation""). Most of the people using Creature however soon realise the power of the motors because it just saves them so much time; plus the results are very smooth!  Let me know if you have any other questions!"

Is this by any chance done by raycasting between the 'grapple' and the player, and if the ray hits an obstacle, it creates a new rope & ray from that point, parents the player to that rope, and maintains the original velocity?   I may have to try a sample project before the concept escapes my head, this looks real good!"

Unity2D,38g9hx,TheWarPelican,2,Thu Jun 4 11:34:26 2015 UTC,"From looking into it a bit today and from his answer to me, it seems that he creates a DistanceJoint2D at the grappling point, which the player is anchored to. The 'rope' itself is just an illusion, being just a simple LineRenderer between the player and the current grappling point.  Every time there is an obstacle between the player and the grappling point, a new joint/line renderer is made at the point of the obstacle (which you can see as red dots in the gif), to which to player is anchored to. The previously used joint is disabled at the same time.  I'm currently trying to work out how he managed to get it to use previous joints/LineRenderer's when he swings back past the points of obstruction/collision."
Unity2D,38g9hx,LordHamburger,2,Thu Jun 4 12:29:02 2015 UTC,I reuse the same line renderer the entire time while tracking points. The unwrap can be tricky because line of site with a raycast is not always enough. What if you see the previous grapple point but are in a wrap on the other side of the block? etc. For that I track the angles at the point of collisions to compare when swinging.
Unity2D,38g9hx,Kiipo,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:58:56 2015 UTC,Is there any way you could give some tips when it comes to the contact part? Do you use point of collision?

Unity2D,38g9hx,tehyosh,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:02:57 2015 UTC,"Keep track of the current rotation point and the end point. Then just racist to see if you've hit an object. You'll have to do a bit of math to make sure the wrapping point is actually on the corner, and adjust the current angle and swing velocity appropriately.  Edit: also change the rotation point to the new wrapped position.   Are you using an angle and a radius to calculate where the player should be positioned?"
Unity2D,38g9hx,Marmadukian,2,Thu Jun 4 22:37:22 2015 UTC,"i've went in a different direction a bit. i raycast on update() between the player and the end point (after the first end point is created). as soon as another object is hit i add a point there and move the end point there, while keeping the original point for drawing purposes.  for player positioning i'll be using distance joint.  edit: here's a clip with the approach i took to see if the idea works when going around objects.  no distance joint implemented yet tho, maybe tomorrow.  http://gfycat.com/RapidDescriptiveKissingbug"
Unity2D,38g9hx,tehyosh,2,Thu Jun 4 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"A main part of realistic physics your missing, is when a new rotation point is added, the current angular velocity increases. You can test this with a yo yo and a 2x4, if you swing the yo yo at the 2x4 once it starts wrapping, it increases in speed until the yo yo hits the 2x4. Also when a rotation point is removed, the angular velocity decreases. You should study up on circular motion and angular velocity. Also when the length of rope increases or decreases, angular velocity changes. I forget the exact formulas needed, since I did it two years ago. Using builtin tools from unity can only get you so far, the rest will need to be derived from physics."

You could make entire games in one scene or use multiple to store stuff separately. Using multiple scenes clears everything in the current scene when it loads a new scene. You could consider that a benefit (easy to make changes to one scene at a time) or a detriment (having to load and destroy/create instead of object pooling).

The Inspector only shows you your local position, so the position relative to the parent. If the parent is not located at 0,0,0, then his position is added to that of the child. If the parent object is scaled, then that scale is multiplied to the location of the child, to compensate. Make sure your object has either no parent or that it's parent don't have scale. You can also set ""transform.localPosition"" to set it's relative location.  The second possibility is float inaccuracy. Floating point values are by definition not 100% accurate. This inaccuracy shouldn't affect your values though, except your object is very small or very large. And I mean VERY. You can expect float inaccuracy if your value depends on something like the 10th decimal place or if your value is extremely large and you still depend on decimal values. As that is not the case, I don't think you are a victim of float inaccuracy. I still want to give you the info, so you are not confused when Unity is setting your rotation or something to 89.9999999999 instead of 90.  In your case, I think you simply confused localPosition and position, so check your setup and come back if you still can't figure out what's wrong."
Unity2D,38eaqg,loofou,12,Wed Jun 3 17:54:10 2015 UTC,"Your first point was my problem! The two objects are children of another object, and that parent object had a weird position, which was causing the weird offset issue. From a quick google search, transform.localPosition is relative to the parent position, whereas transform.position is the world position?  Edit: My problem has been solved. Thanks for your response!"

But I included it mainly because of the ""transform.position is not very accurate"" point to explain the possible future question of why the position is 1.00000001 instead of plain 1."

I personally am not sure what's causing that; I would guess some other position-related code is screwing with the values. You shouldn't create a new Vector3 every time you reset the positions when the positions don't change though; it's generally considered bad practice. Instead, make a private Vector3, maybe startPosLeft and startPosRight, and assign it the coords you want. Plus, then (assuming you're using Visual Studio, which you really should be) you can watch the values of those variables when you debug."

Sure lessons or tutorial may be game related or something like that, but it will be hard to do something without knowing basic concepts.  To solve your problem You can use 100 different approaches and there no right one.  First can you explain where do You store use selection (rock, paper or scissor)?  You should loop through all the selections and compare them. Or compare one by one since there is limited outcomes."
Unity2D,38e1r5,friicis,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:21:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so currently I have on button press per gaamepad add the player's gameobject to a list of game objects. Essentially, there are three lists:   RockPlayers, PaperPlayers, ScissorsPlayers.   so when a player presses the button that chooses Rock, they are added to the ""rockplayers"" list (and so on for other lists).   What I currently need now is a way for at the end of the round, to CHECK which list everyone is in and delineate points based on results."
Unity2D,38e1r5,friicis,2,Thu Jun 4 16:46:48 2015 UTC,"So this list that game objects are added to most likely is array or at least it should be possible to loop through it.  You should be able to access each specific object and its data from this list.  Here would be a simple example of an array and loop - it will loop through all array values:  string[] list = { ""rock"", ""paper"", ""scissor"" };  foreach (string value in list) {     Debug.Log(value); }   So inside array instead of string variables there can be stored object, numbers e.t.c.  I'm not sure in what kind of list Your objects is stored, but most likely it is array.

Things like what language the game is set to, custom input configuration, etc. The sorts of stuff you see in ""settings"" and ""preferences"" screens. On Windows playerprefs values are stored in the system registry, and on Mac it's stored in a preferences plist. You're performing an unnecessary disk write every single time you update a variable.  If what you want to do is keep an object around during a scene change, you're looking for DontDestroyOnLoad."

Unity2D,386xw3,djgreedo,0,Tue Jun 2 08:39:51 2015 UTC,I believe I'm in 2D mode. It's still pretty clunky.
Unity2D,386xw3,iamallamaa,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:05:22 2015 UTC,"First, what tool are you using for creating Tiled prefabs? Tiled2Unity (free, and the most common) I thought would chunk the map up into smaller pieces, but I use the importer from 2dToolkit and I know their importer does chunk. I believe you can even specify the chunk size but it's been a while since I played with it (already have map imported).  Second, loading/unloading chunks is where I went originally but I found out that it is largely un-necessary and in fact introduced lag. Unity already does ""frustum culling"" which means items that are off screen don't add any overhead to processing. Just as long as you don't have an update function running each frame (and your map likely is for display only so doesn't need one) you should be fine. And now that pro == free in features, you can also use occlusion culling but this is less helpful in 2d mode.  And lastly, what do you  mean by the scene view being ""clunky""? It was originally designed for 3d, and 2d mode is just 3d view locked to 2d. However, I haven't had any issues navigating around in it. You can use the keyboard to select the different buttons in the top (pan, move, rotate..etc). ""Q"", ""W"", ""E"", ""R""...etc select the buttons from left to right. You can hold the ""Alt"" key to quick switch to pan mode from any other mode and drag your view around (in 3d mode alt switches to a rotate view). You can click around and drag stuff easily or select it in the scene hierarchy to select an item in the scene view and double click it to zoom to it in the scene view."
Unity2D,386xw3,iamallamaa,0,Tue Jun 2 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"I'm using Tiled2Unity, but didn't see any chunksize options. It didn't do any mesh optimization, so each 'tile' was a quad. The 200x200 tile map had almost 100k vertices split over like three meshes.   I'd also like to do a bit of this manually to help me get used to unity. I'll probably allow unity to do frustum culling like you suggested, though.  Thanks for the hotkey suggestions, I'm having trouble transitioning since I've used blender for years and it's my only 3D experience. It's just not as intuitive for me.  There's one caveat; I'd like to load a certain tile layer as individual objects. I'm using a 3/4th view and will need to use them both as collision, and sort them so my player and enemies can walk ahead of and behind them based on their y and (fake) z coordinate.  So I'm thinking it'd be beneficial to disable/enable collision chunks, and if I'm going to do that, I might as well disable the drawing for those chunks too."
Unity2D,386xw3,iamallamaa,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"I just meant I don't use Tiled2Unity and thought it did chunks. I use 2dToolkit for importing maps and I know it does do chunking. I think in both cases though, each tile is still a quad. However I don't know if or how much this affects performance. Originally I tried to follow this tutorial on youtube and ""roll my own"" tilemap system. Building chunks in real time while enabling/disabling the chunks ended up being a performance hit every time something was drawn. Using an importer and just leaving the maps in the scene seemed to work MUCH better."

Unity2D,385600,delbin,3,Mon Jun 1 22:51:22 2015 UTC,"Like zenatsu mentioned, there's a few ways to move units around.  You'll then need to worry about things such as:  How does your mouse select a unit, how do you select multiple units, giving orders to single or multiple units, how will skills show up on the screen depending on current selections, etc.    In terms of pathfinding to get units to move around things (transform.translate can be perfect for simple line movement, then you could enable pathfinding when they encounter obstacles between them and their target), you can look at the Unity-specific A* Pathfinding Project asset, beyond that things to google for in general are ""boids, flocking, steering"" etc.  If you're 3D and not 2D, you can probably use the built-in NavMesh but I'm unsure.    http://stormtek.geek.nz/rts_tutorial/index.php  (movement example is one page) http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/collection-of-unity-tutorials-for-an-rts.234490/"

That's like tracing a painting and releasing it as your own.  Sure, using tutorials during the process for small things you may not understand, but you probably shouldn't use a tutorial for an entire game and expect it to turn out. How ridiculous does the question ""Can someone give me a tutorial to make the next viral mobile game?"" sound?  Again, maybe it's just your wording, but it's a bit general.

I've completed a few tutorials already, but there's different concepts at work here than would be in some of those.  Deck building, inventory management, multiplayer, and hidden information come to mind off the top of my head."
Unity2D,382syc,GPow69,4,Mon Jun 1 20:23:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't expect this to be so long, holy smokes. Sorry. I've felt this way about the state of ""game dev learning"" for a long time though, and I need to get it out.  There are a bunch of those tutorials, but there really shouldn't be. It's teaching people how and not why. It takes away a lot of the thinking involved with development, and people get the false sense that you can just bang out a game with no hiccups along the way. It seems that way because the one teaching has already made it, already worked out the kinks and redesigned things, and already knows a quick path from start to finish. You never get to see their nights of frustration only to end up with ""fuck it, we'll toss this entire system and start over. Back to the drawing board.""  You pick up things and have a greater understanding when you piece together smaller bits, connecting them yourself, rather than having someone else do it for you and copying it.   Deck building, inventory management, multiplayer, and hidden information   These are the things you should look into, rather than a one size fits all guide that covers everything, because that'll enforce one way to do it, and as we all know, there's never just one way to do something in game development. If you could, I'd say break these down even further. For example with inventory management, start with creating and answering some questions: What type of thing will this inventory hold? What's the best way to store this information code-wise? Does it need a visual representation, and how should it look? How do we translate the data structures holding the information into visuals? How, when, and where will it be accessed? Who should be allowed to access what parts? How will we prevent things being shown that aren't supposed to be?  There's many more questions, and the more the better. Of course, this isn't the only way to plan a feature. I find it works pretty well, though, since it forces you to think about the interactions within the system before you run into that huge roadblock and have to throw out half your code. Once you've got a decent plan laid out, then is a good time to start looking for tutorials and code samples, to see how other people have implemented each little bit. In this example case, I'd probably start with data storage. I'd take a look at how other people have structured their bits of data, and whether any parts of it are compatible with my bits of data (which they may not be: as a very simple example, if they've got a fixed inventory size and I don't, they may simply store objects in a fixed size array. That wouldn't work for me, since the size of mine changes. I'd need to change it to a list or find some other alternative to better fit my needs.)  If you expect your final product to be anything different than the final product of the tutorial, you may find that making a change somewhere in the middle ruins the entire thing because of how the teacher did something, and you may have to scrap the whole project because you have no understanding of how the bits fit together.  I'm speaking from experience here, I used to learn this way (not only in games, in web dev too), but eventually realized that if I wanted to make my own things, I'd have to really abstract down the concepts to be learned. It comes and bites you in the ass when you've done nothing but rely on tutorials and there's no all-encompassing tutorial for the thing you want to make, but you lack the thinking skills needed to break down the problem into manageable research topics."

Unity2D,380vbl,boyfromda4thletta,6,Mon Jun 1 02:43:37 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I'll definitely do a tutorial at some point. I don't want to put these scripts out there right now, as they're really poorly written, and it'd probably do more harm than good to your learning haha.  I can give a quick run-down of how it's set up, though.  My grapple script starts with a simple check on a bool to see if we're grappling at the moment.  if (!grappling) {    // code for shooting the grappling hook goes here. } else {   // Code for applying grappling tension force, and detected whether the player wants to stop grappling goes here }   The code for beginning a grapple, once a mouse click is detected, is a for loop of Physics2d.raycast tests, looking for objects on my ""grapple"" layer. Right now it measures the angle from the player to the mouse click, converts that Vector2 to degrees, then loops through a series of adjustments to also test for a few degrees (adjustable) in either direction.   Here's what that looks like.  Once it catches something on the layer it's looking for, it breaks the for loop, and goes through the process of activating the grapple (setting up the grapple target vector, determining the rope length based on current distance from the target, deactivating the jump script, and enabling the Line Renderer for the grappling line itself).  On the other side of things, once the next Update() rolls around and ""grappling"" is now true, it'll first check to see if the player has hit either the mouse button or the jump button, in which case it'll deactivate the grapple, doing the opposite of what I just listed above.  Otherwise, it moves on to applying the tension force.  The first thing I do when applying tension is check to see if the player has moved outside the bounds of the ropeLength that I set up earlier. If so, I nudge him back within bounds with a Vector3.MoveTowards the target Vector. Then, a bunch of fancy, poorly written math AddForce's the player in the direction of the target, using a formula for tension in a pendulum that I grabbed off some college physics site.  The last little bit of code updates the position of the LineRenderer, and you get the results seen in the gif above!  As for the lighting of the scene, which /u/Steamwells asked for, it's a pretty straightforward Unity2D scene. Here's the setup from the front.  The elements of the scene are all Quads placed in 3d space, some a bit further back in the z. The lights are pulled toward the camera in the z, so they can illuminate the quads. Fortunately, the z doesn't matter when calculating any Physics2D stuff, so you can place them anywhere you want for visual effect.   Hope that answered some questions. Let me know if you have any more."

Unity2D,380vbl,Alexandreapt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:47:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, the Boolean is really just a way for you remind yourself whether you're grappling or not at the moment.   So in your function for starting a grapple, you have a ""grappling = true"" line in there, to set that Boolean so that when you check it later (in the next update cycle), you know that you are grappling.  On the other hand, when you ungrapple, you're going to set that Boolean as false, so you know you're no longer grappling when the next update cycle comes around.   Now, knowing whether or not you're grappling is pretty important. You don't want to be able to start a grapple when you're already grappling, and you don't want to be applying tension force when you're not grappling.   Did that clear things up a little?"

Unity2D,381s6c,fdt_dev,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:20:41 2015 UTC,I'm really confused here. What's the gain by going with 3D physics if you're not taking advantage of all 3 axis?
Unity2D,381s6c,charlie4lyfe,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:25:36 2015 UTC,"http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/finalfightclones/punisher-arcade.png  look at the screenshot. these are 3 axis. without real 3d, you have to fake the coordinates to make the characters walk up and down. i'm assuming that you want to do a beat em up like the one in the screenshot. if you want to do something like street fighter, a fighting game, then my response above doesn't apply.  In addition to fake the coordinates, you have to manually manage Z order in everything in the screen, something that can be very slow if not managed well."
Unity2D,381s6c,fdt_dev,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:11:09 2015 UTC,"I suppose with careful camera placement that could work. When I worked on a beat em up, we used 2D, as it made more sense to me, but I get your way as well."
Unity2D,381s6c,charlie4lyfe,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:45:44 2015 UTC,"I worked in two beat em ups in AS3 , and with a 2D framework is logical to make things 2D and fake coordinates. But in Unity, the 2D is faked with the orthogonal camera. It makes things more complex to ignore that fact and lose all the visual debugging features of the editor. Positioning characters in 3D can show you without problems if a hitbox is colliding another hitbox, with no danger of create confusions. I don't saying that you have to use the 3D physics, i only saying that it's better to position the objects in 3D. This is an incomplete tech demo of a Beat Em Up i was doing some time ago in Unity 4.5.  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1835309/BeatEmUp2014/web.html Open it with Firefox, Chrome doesn't support Unity Web Player."
Unity2D,381s6c,fdt_dev,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:06:45 2015 UTC,"http://andrewnapierkowski.com/Builds.html   [EDIT] Controls are WASD to move, E to punch, and space to jump  Feel free to try my game as well. The implementation simply used the y position to determine the order in layer. To make jumping/collisions make sense the game used a base object with a circle collider for movement/bounds, then had a child object with the sprite on it. When the player jumped, apply the movement to the sprite but not the origin object. Then for attacking collisions, I used a collision box for the attacker, to be sure the jumping didn't make a false positive, just shoot a ray from the base of the attacker, if it collides with the defender, it's a hit.  Not saying this way was better, just showing my implementation as well."
Unity2D,380ker,Abysinian,2,Sun May 31 23:31:19 2015 UTC,Looks pretty cool!  What's the influence mainly?  I'm feeling some Terraria and Magicite but with Sega Genesis graphics.
Unity2D,380ker,rheidaus,2,Tue Jun 2 04:47:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Those were definitely two big ones (Terraria/Magicite), as well as Maplestory (which TooMuchHam seems to have guessed haha) and a few others of a similar genre like Starbound :]"
Unity2D,380ker,TooMuchHam,2,Tue Jun 2 16:09:21 2015 UTC,Is this maplestory?! haha Get some jumping and falling animations in there and the game will look solid.
Unity2D,380ker,myknees,2,Tue Jun 2 05:15:52 2015 UTC,"Haha, you nailed it. That's been my #1 inspiration. Loved the game so much as a kid/teenager and wanted to bring something of that game to this one.  Thanks for the feedback!  There actually is a jumping animation, but (and I've heard the same thing from a few others) it seems like people are finding it hard to see/it doesn't stand out - I've probably just become accustomed to noticing it with working on the characters so much. So I think I'll get my artist to perhaps re-do it to make it much more obvious, and maybe have something like a somersault to show the 2nd jump of a double-jump."
Unity2D,380u50,Kasc,2,Mon Jun 1 00:49:26 2015 UTC,"Great question! Hopefully more people will weigh in on how they create and use this kind of debug information.  Personally, I think it's overly complicated and you are prematurely optimizing. I don't think there's any reason to worry about one extra object with a few labels on it that you might not need at release.  How I would do it depends on what the data is used for. The vast majority of ""debug data"" that I create is temporary. I use it to troubleshoot a bug and then I delete it again when everything is working fine. For that data, I would just create the object and delete it when I'm done.  If it is data that I anticipate needing to use during testing but not for the gameplay, I would have a single object that I can show and hide at will (for instance, in a menu option, a command-line argument, or even a text command in chat). The object can then be deleted before release, or perhaps just set as an ""editor only"" object so you still have it available but it isn't shipped.  If the data might be needed to troubleshoot issues, I would go with a log file over anything on the screen. The reason being that if a user runs into this problem, you can't see the label on the screen. But you can ask for a log file. Again, the generation of the log file should be on-demand (or it should only log exceptions).  So I guess what I'm suggesting is that you look at where the data is used and design for that. I would not worry about whether or not the data gets compiled into the build (unless you plan to add huge resources just for debugging but that seems unlikely). Just make sure this debug data is isolated so you can easily suppress or delete it, and you can always decide what to do before releasing a build to others."
Unity2D,380u50,Ixchael,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:07:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input.  I didn't want to halt my progress so I just continued with runtime creation of prefabs and I've found it to be quite quick now. I quickly make the prefab in the editor during runtime then switch to my IDE and essentially write out what I've drafted in the editor.  Sure, it takes a bit longer but after doing it a couple of times the speed at which I could do it greatly increased now that I've familiar with what needs to be written in code. I feel this approach is very clean since, as far as I know, all evidence of my debugging tools will be automatically removed from any release builds whilst my tools will still be present in any development builds not run within the editor (which is reason I didn't want to use editor-only prefabs). This is all assuming that I am consistent in my #if UNITY_DEBUG usage!  Perhaps my view will change if I need to make any debug tools beyond simple text displays :P"

Unity2D,37xawe,doctorvonscience,1 point,Sun May 31 15:59:14 2015 UTC,You can change the shape of a polygon collider by holding shift and dragging the green dots that appear on the edges of the collider.  You can also click to create new dots.  Play around with that and see if that helps.

Unity2D,37xawe,goshdarngames,1 point,Sun May 31 16:16:46 2015 UTC,Just make the box collider smaller! There's no need to have a separate object than the one your sprite renderer is on.
Unity2D,37wpfe,GreyToad,2,Sun May 31 01:00:54 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're talking about a 2D game.  If that's the case one way to avoid this problem is just to use the Z Axis.  As for your current problem here's a guess:  You could make an object with a script attached that at Start gets the value of each sorting layer. Each sorting layer will have its own unique number to identify it. Basically you could create an empty object on each layer and your script would check the sorting layer of each of those objects and save them as variables that you could reference later.  For example:  ""Object_1"" is an empty invisible object on the sorting layer ""Background Objects"" you have an empty game object in your scene with a script named SortingLayerManager  on it that has this code on it.   public Renderer object_1  public static int backgroundObjectsLayerID;   Start () {        backgroundObjectsLayerID = object_1.sortingLayerID;  }   and that way if you ever need to check to see what layer a renderer is on you could compare it to SortingLayerManager.backgroundObjectsLayerID and if it matches you know that the renderer is on the BackgroundObjects layer.  This is pretty much all guesswork on my part though as I personally just use the Z axis to sidestep all these problems."
Unity2D,37wpfe,Randommook,1 point,Sun May 31 02:07:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help! I probably won't fiddle with the Z axis stuff since I rely on that for the lighting, but I may use your other solution in the future, especially if Unity decides to change the sorting layer ids again"
Unity2D,37wpfe,iamallamaa,2,Sun May 31 04:13:09 2015 UTC,"Did a quick google and it appears there isn't an easy way to get the sorting layer ids. Found this which tells how, but I couldn't get it to work in a quick try.  Only thing I can think of is that you could set each layer by name one at a time (if you know them ahead) and then get the ids after and store them somewhere (static property of a class maybe).      SpriteRenderer sr = GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>();     Debug.Log(sr.sortingLayerID); //0 (Default)     sr.sortingLayerName = ""Testing"";     Debug.Log(sr.sortingLayerID); //-302023661   Edit: I did get the code in the Unity Answers link to work (missing a using System reference). Seemed to work fine."
Unity2D,37wpfe,kreaol,1 point,Sun May 31 02:23:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the idea! I ended up doing something like this in the end since I noticed the sorting layer IDs remained consistent between runs.

Unity2D,37tbsw,kreaol,1 point,Sun May 31 14:12:26 2015 UTC,"This prompted me to realise I had missed something crucial!   As a bit of background, my terrain is not a sprite, rather it is a mesh that I'm adding tile textures too in chunks, so I can't set it to sprite-diffuse like I would with my other sprites.   Your query prompted me to check the settings for the shader on the ""chunk"" prefab, whilst it was set to ""standard"" I had not opened out the options section and found that by dropping the smoothness down to 0 stops the parallax effect.  I've added some gifs to illustrate what I was seeing in both circumstances.   With smoothing turned up - Note how there's an ""orb"" orbiting the torch With 0 smoothing - Now there is no orb!   This sort of solves my problem, however I still would like to achieve something similar to what wanderlust has (the 3 level light with severe gradient change), I wonder if this is possible with unity's current lights, or if it's possible to make my own light.  It's worth noting that I want control over the diameter and intensity of the light (similar to what I would have with the built in light)  edit - Thanks for pointing out screentogif, much easier than my method of using OBS and a free online converter for mp4->gif..."

Unity2D,37tq9t,NotRocketScieeence,1 point,Sat May 30 08:50:06 2015 UTC,I think Unity scales the resolution according to the size/dimension of your Game Scene and your Monitor.

If I can't seem to find a float value good enough for the jump since the BITalino is very sensitive to interference.  if (reader.asStart && !m_Jump)         {             int i = 0;             foreach(BITalinoFrame f in reader.getBuffer())             {                 float posEMG = (float) (f.GetAnalogValue(0));                  float posEDA = (float) (f.GetAnalogValue(1));                 if (posEMG == posEDA){                     m_Jump = true;                 }                 i++;
Unity2D,37qnwm,gunder_bc,2,Sat May 30 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"Generally comparing floats is better done with a subtraction and comparison to an Epsilon.  EG:  if (Mathf.abs(posEMG - posEDA) < Mathf.Epsilon) {     m_jump = true; }   or, more succinctly:  m_jump = (Mathf.abs(posEMG - posEDA) < Mathf.Epsilon);   You'll probably also want to look into debouncing the input to prevent repeat jump triggers from the same ""button press""."
Unity2D,37qnwm,RedMolo,2,Sat May 30 16:17:39 2015 UTC,"Also, if you can use the enum instead of magick numbers in the GetAnalogValue() call, that'd be a good idea.  If they ever update the library and change the positions of those values your code will break when using the underlying indexes instead of the enum values."
Unity2D,37qnwm,PachowStudios,2,Sat May 30 16:20:27 2015 UTC,"You could try reading and outputting the signals for various inputs, make a note and then use that as the data you compare against for inputs"

Unity2D,37orby,Dawnfall_Games,4,Fri May 29 05:24:19 2015 UTC,"Enemy AI is similar to pathfinding. In A* algorithm, you assign points to the found paths, and if you want the shortest path, you choose the  path with the lower point.   So, in ai-design, you need to assign points to enemy hp, player hp, shoot options (number of bullets if there is any), etc... This is basic attack design.  If you need a little bit more complexity, for instance ai-tanks need to escape or hide behind a structure you need to find positions in the game map where player can not directly see behind.  Don't understand the tanks to split up the map. If you mean squad attack formations, you need to find the positions for each tank to move to for next turn and find the shortest paths to that point or closest point.  Good luck on your project"

Unity2D,37orby,vancity-,3,Fri May 29 22:07:36 2015 UTC,"I'm finding the biggest thing for wrapping your head around AI design is figuring out what the AI knows about. If you want the AI to attack the player, it needs to know about the player. If you want formations with other tanks, it needs to know about the other AI tanks.   So start with the references with other objects. Then choose a small slice of functionality to build. Like finding the player. Once that slice is done, start expanding out with more complicated functionality.   Also, I ended in using an A* plugin from the Unity Asset Store. It might end up saving you some time."

Unity2D,37orby,Cabskee,2,Fri May 29 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"I find AI easiest to implement as a priority list - make this in English first, similar to what you have. Basically, start out from an AI's ideal scenario, check if that scenario is true, then go through less than ideal scenarios, and so on.  For example:  If (in range, have a clear shot, and have enough energy)  then - shoot at enemy  Else if(in range, have a clear shot, not enough energy)  then- figure out what your tank should do in this case  Else if(no clear shot, in range)  then - find a clear shot (using raycasting and the pathfinding)  Else if (not in range)  then - move into range (might need to pathfind)  Once you get that list figured out, all you need to do is convert it to code. Having the tanks split up is just another thing to add to the list - if tank A is within x distance of the closest tank, move away from that tank."

Unity2D,37nsnf,Sephhhh,1 point,Sat May 30 14:24:38 2015 UTC,"This doesn't quite answer your question, but might offer a better solution (I've done something similar before).  This approach will only work if you load your tiles from some predefined or procedurally generated map etc  (as opposed to placing them in the scene view), so they can be indexed with an x/y coordinate.  If so, you could do the following   Place a single 3D Box Collider across your entire tile map. Raycast to find the point in world space that you have selected. Divide that position by the size of your tiles (then Math.Floor() or cast to int). This will give you the x/y coordinate of the tile. Index into your map to get the tile that was selected.   For example:   If each of your tiles has a size of 2x2. And you select a point at Vector2(4.123, 1.002). x = (int)(4.123 / 2) = 2 y = (int)(1.002 / 2) = 0 Then do something like this SelectedTile = TileMap[2,0];   This removes the need to have colliders on all of you static/stationary tiles. You'll still need colliders on any moving objects."
Unity2D,37nsnf,bmanrules,1 point,Fri May 29 01:35:13 2015 UTC,"This is the solution I'm slowly leaning towards. However there are a lot of objects that aren't part of the map, but are on the ""Walls"" layer. For instance, I have mushrooms and barrels that are on the wall layer until the player eats/breaks them.   Right now I'm thinking of making my own pseudo-Raycast method that does two things:   Uses the method you describe to check if there are any walls Uses a simple 2d raycast to check for any objects like barrels that are on the wall layer   It then would return true/false depending on if the space is open.   Would you have any tips for implementing a system like this, or do you think there is a better way to do it?"

I disabled the text inside the ItemInfoPanel to give you the idea the problem I'm facing.   Which of those hierarchy objects corresponds to which parts of the image?   The ActionDialogueInv(Clone) represents the Lists of buttons like Drop, Examine, and Cancel.  The ItemInfoPanel is the one ""behind"" the ActionDialogueInv. The text in ItemInfoPanel is ""in front of"" the ActionDialogueInv, hence the problem.   What is image 3 supposed to look like?   It's just a grey rectangular box with text defining the item info inside it. The game object of this is called ItemInfoPanel.  Sorry for not making things clear in the first place."

Unity2D,37ly2p,KingMoonfish,5,Thu May 28 16:15:51 2015 UTC,"My current game is an isometric view, and I preferably am using the 3D project defaults.  Unity does not have a 2D or 3D engine, unless you want to get into semantics and refer to PhysX/Box2D. Unity has the Unity Engine.  The only difference between ""2D"" and ""3D"" in Unity are the project defaults, notably how new scenes are setup at first and what settings imported textures default to. You can freely switch between project defaults at any point in time. Your only true 2D/3D restriction is when you utilize the built-in colliders/rigidbodies: You must stick to the same type. You cannot add a BoxCollider component to an object with a Rigidbody2D component, etc.   Otherwise you can freely switch between the 2D/3D collider/rigidbody variants, but generally it's good practice to stay in line with what you chose for project defaults to avoid any confusion down the road.   but would it be easier than setting variables for depth and other things that the 2D engine would require?   I think it would be easier to get proper depth of, say, ground tiles in a 3D project, yes. My brain hurts less when I think of a locked-angle isometric view with 3D objects then when I think about one trying to do the same with Sorting Layers/Order. I think if old-school games had a choice, they would have done it in ""3D"" as well, but what they implemented was of necessity, not best-option.   I imagine I'd have to set the angle and foreshortening distances. (90 by 90 by 180 degrees, x and y being 90)   This confuses me."

Unity2D,37ly2p,TheCatalyse,3,Thu May 28 17:43:12 2015 UTC,"Here my opinion, emphasis on that.  We started our game in 2D mode, and 3D mode is very similar in nature to 3D mode with the main difference being that it sets up the camera mode for you along with a few other things.  Now, with that being said.  Our game was doing just fine, till we got into physics.  Initially we didn't have any and were just using transforms to move things.  But once we did we saw a huge drop in performance as compared to 3D physics.  We really have no idea why.  That aside, you can still use all 2D features in 3D mode, but it doesnt go both ways.  A second major point is that all the pathfinding solutions including unities(even for just where your platformer is allowed to stand) dont support the X-Y plane that 2D mode is on.  So what I would suggest.  Is leave the project in 3D mode, and make the camera orthographic on the X-Z plane(default 3D top down) which leaves you with a lot more options since the whole set of 2D features is somewhat new and still needs a good bit of work."

Some third party tools expect 2D like the Tiled2Unity tool (can be hacked of course though to support colliders and not collider2d)  Also there are some things that work better in 3D. Particle collisions don't support Collider2D.

Unity2D,37mp5r,Meerul264,1 point,Thu May 28 22:15:19 2015 UTC,"Your code is taking the object's current position and storing it in a variable called ""lastPos"".  You then calculate the difference between the object's current position and the variable ""lastPos"" and store the result in a variable called ""offset""; ""offset"" will always be (0,0).  This explains why your animation controller is always getting 0 for input_x and input_y.  I think you want to move the ""lastPos = obj.position;"" line to the end of the function like so:  private Vector3 lastPos;  private Transform obj; void FixedUpdate() {   // This line should really be in the OnEnable   obj = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag(""Player"").transform;    Vector2 movementVector = new Vector2(target.x, target.y);   Vector2 offset = obj.position - lastPos;    if (offset != Vector2.zero)   {     anim.SetBool(""isWalking"", true);     anim.SetFloat(""input_x"", offset.x);     anim.SetFloat(""input_y"", offset.y);     transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(transform.position, target, speed * Time.fixedDeltaTime);   }   else      anim.SetBool(""isWalking"", false);    // Store this object's current position for the next FixedUpdate.   lastPos = obj.position; }"

Instead of moving objects with rigidbody2d.AddForce, I use raycasts to detect collisions and move objects directly with transform.Translate. Because I don't worry about things such as mass or friction and instead calculate movement by straight forward distance = speed * time, I'm able to put my movement code in Update thus letting it scale perfectly for varying frame rates."
Unity2D,37i9c3,Cabskee,1 point,Thu May 28 01:27:30 2015 UTC,"Do you have any performance or missteps with this method? I've tried numerous times using Raycasts+Translate over AddForce, and the results are very off-putting. The biggest problem I've had is that sometimes the Raycast doesn't even detect something right in front of it, making it go directly through it - Which is incredibly annoying, and I've never yet found out why. Any ideas, or have you ever seen this before?"
Unity2D,37i9c3,PachowStudios,1 point,Thu May 28 03:16:06 2015 UTC,"I haven't had any major issues with it so far. Performance was actually much better when I switched a bunch of stuff over from FixedUpdate to Update in part because raycasts are incredibly inexpensive to use. Using FixedUpdate with this method can cause issues such as the one's you're experiencing. Another thing to check is make sure your raycasts are going far enough.  If anything though, the biggest advantage I see with this approach is not having to fight against Unity's physics. For a 2D platformer, it's nearly impossible to get tight movement with the built in physics.  I would highly recommend checking out prime31's 2D character controller: https://github.com/prime31/CharacterController2D. It's an excellent starting point and reference for taking a raycast approach.  If it helps, you can also check out the code for the game I made for Ludum Dare 32 which uses this method: https://github.com/PachowStudios/BadTummyBunny The code isn't amazing due to being made in 48hrs, but hopefully it will still help! :)"

Which method do you use?  Haha I've definitely used that asset before. I use probably 3 or 4 Prime31 free tools in each of my projects, and I've bought many of his premium assets. Great guy, and great tools."

The ""days of not allowing people to choose 8f they want to see an ad are dead"". That phrase is too easy and too clichè to say.

Unity2D,37heek,RedMolo,3,Wed May 27 17:29:16 2015 UTC,"If you think there's a chance you may want to scale into something even of medium size, I would strongly advise you to look into abstracting the tile data into an array or a list, and use a static number of game objects to represent the tiles.  That sounds vague and unclear, so maybe an example would help.   I'm working on a game where I instantiate a 20x20 grid of empty game objects and attach a sprite renderer to each. I also have a 2d array of integers to represent the entire map (which can be of any size). When the player moves the map around, the game objects simply update their sprite renderer to draw the appropriate texture that corresponds to the array location that is in view. This is far more efficient than creating/destroying game objects or having a 100x100 grid (or larger!) of game objects.  This is very similar to object pooling that folks do very commonly for other tasks."

Unity2D,37heek,asebist,1 point,Wed May 27 23:22:15 2015 UTC,"DISCLAIMER: I'm a Unity Nub. I've been working with Unity for a month or so now coming from a c/c++ hobbyist programmer background. If there's a better way to do something than what I've explained below, PLEASE feel free to correct me!  I'm doing something similar to what JomDarbert is doing. I have a data structure called MapData[,] which is created at run time. Each ""tile"" in the map is defined by the following class:  public class CMapData {     int tile;      public int Tile () {         return(tile);     }     public void SetTile(int t) {         if (t>=0 && t<256)             tile = t;     } }   I can easily add features to a tile by simply adding another variable (e.g., bool walkable) and then some public functions to go with it (e.g., IsWalkable()).  In my main Map:Monobehavior script that's attached to a gameobject that I stick in the scene I declare:  public CMapData[,] MapData;   and then allocate it like so:  MapData = new CMapData[mapWidth,mapHeight];   I declare it public so I can access it from other scripts.  So of course one of the first things I discovered trying to make a 2d RPG map like this was the 64000 vertex limit for a mesh. Just a relatively small to mid-sized (from an RPG standpoint) 128x128 tile map would require 65536 vertices at 4 per tile/quad. Bleh.   Then I remembered what I had already been doing from scratch with c++. I would have a large map in memory just like above, but I would only display a piece of it on the screen at any given time depending on how far zoomed out I was.   I decided to try this in Unity. I created a ""view mesh"" which would be the piece of the map that would be visible in the viewport at any given moment. This would basically just be a view into the map centered around the player/camera position. I'm still juggling proportions and stuff, but I came up with something that approximately fills the screen based on the current viewport (i.e., windowed vs. fullscreen).  Oh and I also use a 1024x1024 pixel texture for a texture atlas for my ground tiles. Grass, dirt, etc., are all 64x64 pixels so I end up with 16x16 textures in my atlas for a total of 256 ground types.   So say I'm looking at game start at 0,0 and my view width = 12 tiles and my view height = 9 tiles. In my Update() I do this:  for (y=0;y<viewHeight;y++) {     for (x=0;x<viewWidth;x++) {         mapx=x+viewX-viewWidth/2;         mapy=y+viewY-viewHeight/2;         tile=GetTile(mapx,mapy);          if (tile>=0) {             // for uv coords - indexes into tile texture atlas             int tileRow=tile/16;             int tileCol=tile-tileRow*16;              float tx0, tx1, ty0, ty1;              tx0=(float)tileCol/16.0f;             tx1=(float)(tileCol+1)/16.0f;             ty0=(float)(16-tileRow-1)/16.0f;             ty1=(float)(16-tileRow)/16.0f;         }          uv[i+0]=new Vector2(tx0,ty1);         uv[i+1]=new Vector2(tx1,ty1);         uv[i+2]=new Vector2(tx0,ty0);         uv[i+3]=new Vector2(tx1,ty0);     } }   And GetTile() is simply:  int GetTile(int x, int y) {     if (MapData == null)         return(-1);      if (x >= 0 && x < mapWidth && y >= 0 && y < mapHeight)         return MapData [x, y].Tile ();     else         return(-1); }   viewX and viewY can be changed with the arrow keys or by holding down right mouse and moving to the edge of the screen. The mousewheel simply changes the height of the camera to simulate zooming in/out. Right now if you zoom out too far you'll see where the viewmesh ends and the grey scene background begins, but that is easily taken care of by 1) capping zoom out distance and/or 2) altering viewWidth and viewHeight up to a certain maximum (i.e., if you let them zoom out too far while keeping the screen filled with tiles, eventually you'll be trying to create a viewmesh that will exceed the 64000 vertex limit!)  I realize the above may be haphazardly presented and for that I apologize. Heh. But it allows one to scroll around a map of whatever size you want and to zoom in/out. I realize that memory constraints would limit the size of the map, but I bumped it up from the 32x32 starter I was experimenting with to 1024x1024 and it worked fine. I was able to scroll for EVER. Heh. Assuming a tile of around 5 feet square it would take a player walking 5 mph almost 12 minutes to walk across such a map, over 16 diagonally.  I've posted my crap/nub/beginner/hacked code here if anyone wants to see what I'm doing.  Good question, RedMolo! I've spent probably hours googling the same topic over the last few weeks.  Take care.  EDIT: Formatting error(s)."

Therefore our rotation of zero, sits on the X-axis. Then 90º is sitting on the Y-axis. Which means 180º is -X and 270º is -Y.  Most people think North (or up) is 360º. But in math, the positive X-Axis is 0º and the positive Y-axis is 90º  Refer to the interactive circle and watch where the degree's are. 360 is the same as 0 in terms of degrees.  If you want, I can also break down the code for you. But adding   angle -= 90   should not really mess with anything, unless you need to work with the rotation of your playership (since angle is only applying to the object the script is attached to)  I recommend rotating the image of your ship 90º clockwise if you don't want to subtract 90  as a bonus you can remove the ""angle -= 90"" for   float angle = Mathf.Atan2 (lookPos.y, lookPos.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg - 90;   to save lines."

I'll try and dig up the fix and get back to you (unable to look at code right now).  EDIT  Here is how I have done it, I can see a few differences, mainly the Vector3.up instead of Vector3.forward, and how we are working out the rotation.  Here I work out the angle from the middle of the screen (where the player is, as camera is centered), to the mouse cursor and work out the rotation:  temp_vector2 = new Vector3(Screen.width * 0.5f, Screen.height * 0.5f, 0);        temp_vector = Input.mousePosition;  input_rotation = temp_vector - temp_vector2;   Here is another example using an enemy sprite (could be anywhere on the screen) aiming for a player (could be anywhere with reference to the enemy):  target_direction = target.transform.position - transform.position; input_rotation = target_direction;   I then instantiate the bullet with the rotation I've calculated:  private void Handle_Bullets(Vector3 owner_rotation) {     GameObject obj_created_bullet;     Vector3 temp_vector;      temp_vector = (transform.position + (owner_rotation.normalized * .5f));     obj_created_bullet = (GameObject) Instantiate(bullet, temp_vector, Quaternion.FromToRotation(Vector3.up, owner_rotation.normalized)); }   Finally I make the bullet travel in a straight line:  void FixedUpdate() {     transform.Translate(Vector3.up * projectile_speed);     transform.position = new Vector3(transform.position.x, transform.position.y, 0); }   Hopefully this can help you out!"

To get access to it (I'm using Unity 5, but I believe it was the same for 4):    Import your sprite sheet, as it is, into Unity  Click on your sprite sheet in Unity and change the Texture Type to Sprite (2D and UI)  Now you should see a few new options, you want to set Sprite Mode to Multiple  Set the Pixels per Unit to a sensible number for your project (for example I have a tile sprite sheet, each tile is 16x16, so I set it to 16, but it may change depending on what the sprite represents) Click the Sprite Editor button Now you should see your sprite sheet open, you now want to ""Slice"" it, this is in the top left corner. At this stage, it depends on how your sprite sheet is designed, do you have spacing between, if so you might be able to use the Automatic mode. However since it is spaced/sized the same I would use the grid approach to be certain you don't end up with any anomalies  Change ""Automatic"" to Grid, then you'll want to enter the various values into this. Once done click slice, it may take a while depending on your computer and the number of sprites.   Unity documentation - http://docs.unity3d.com/460/Documentation/Manual/SpriteEditor.html"

There's no official Unity implementation yet, only a 3rd party one made by users on the forum. It works well for the most part, but it doesn't support all of Spriter's features and, again, it's 3rd party, so if you have any problems or bugs there's no guarantee it'll get fixed. It's on github though so if you want to build your own features on top of it or fix something you could.  The Spriter team is currently working on a generic C++ implementation, and from there they'll be able to easily port it to any game engine, but they've been working on this for a while and it's probably still a ways away from being done.  For 15 bucks though it's a steal!  If you have the budget, Spine seems more polished and has a larger community and support, but I think given time Spriter will catch up.

I definitely plan on buying unless an alternative comes up. Some things I like about this is that rotating the sprites was very clean and did not distort the image. Another bonus is that you can update the sprites easily by replacing the file without starting over. Lastly, creating multiple animations is a breeze. You can copy animations by keyframe including single animations within a keyframe. You can even enable ghosts that help with creating fluid movements.  There are some things I didn't like however. Changing parent/child/hierarchy is very tedious. So far I haven't found a way to move more than 1 sprite at a time in the hierarchy tree. Selecting multiple objects will not work and it will only move the object you selected last and it can be gruesome to move 30+ objects. Another was that I had to rip and convert the scml files to animation data, I'm unsure if the released version on steam was changed to support this but there are some unity packages that will do this for you."

As C# is a prominent language at the moment I would just go look at raw C# tutorials, like how to make console applications to add numbers together and understand programming constructs then start to try to apply them to game development.  So if I wanted to pick up pixel art I would try doing the simplest of examples first then build in complex colours, shading etc.  If you go get Visual Studio 2015 or whatever they call the free one now and go through http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners  Then once you understand variables, functions/methods, classes and inheritance (although composition is often better) then look at unity and hopefully monobehaviours etc will make more sense. Remember there is a good reason why people spend years in university learning how to program, it is a vast and complex subject (although anyone can pick up the basics easy enough).

I didn't get tooo far in Python before switching to C# in Unity, and for that I started here. I felt that rolling through a good number of those tutorials really helped me get a feel for C# in general. Also, he explains stuff, they're wonderful tutorials.   From there I've just been piecing my own project together. Originally I was hitting up UnityAnswers every two seconds, but the moments when I look stuff up are growing farther and farther apart, and I can write my own code now.

Unity2D,3787ew,eyeswulf,1 point,Mon May 25 18:56:40 2015 UTC,"As a side note all the textures used in this gif are not owned by me but placeholders in the dev process of the game  /u/douglasg14b and I are making an RTS style game together, and he has posted here a few times with his turrets and other systems related to attacking (Branch: attacking), on the flip side of the project I am working on a few different things, with the main one being the building system.  We have been making this game for a while now, and originally we were going to make the game very similar to the standard RTS you’ve come to know now a days, with a preset list of buildings that you can build so every game you grind through the same initial building pattern to get to the juicy fights.  This left only a small realm for differing strategy and the good old zerg rush was always a valid option (google: zerg rush).  During the process of doing just that I realized that if I wanted to really learn something I needed to come up with a new way to do this tried and true method.  From that came the modular building system.  Now obviously the hex grid or even a grid system in general is not completely unique and it has been done time and time again in various games namely coming from minecraft.  The difference here is in the implementation.  Instead of having a blocky world, we are making it so that there is no one good strategy.  A zerg rush may not be a valid way to take out this particular opponent.  What this grid system for buildings allows for is a complete customization of one’s base and generalized strategy.  A bit of explanation on the gif: The first building you see is called the Main Core. Which is the first of many cores(see below) that are the main piece of a new grid system.  Each of these cores can support a set number of the blocks that I create on them based on their type and level.  Each block serves a purpose, from adding more power to the grids generation, to helping produce units faster or providing a surrounding defense layer with armor.  The shape of these grids is completely customizable and your only limit is the number of blocks you can have(upgrade that shit!) and your imagination.  Now since this is on a 2d plane, when attacking no matter what you aim at you will hit the first thing your projectile passes.  So if you have a layer of armor all around you base with the sensitive blocks around the outside your attacker will have to destroy one or more of those armor blocks to get to your inner blocks and ultimately the core.  This also allows for you to make your defense directional, only defending the side that you feel is vulnerable.  Luckily you don’t just get one core.  There are various cores(always subject to change):  Main Core,   Weapons Cores(Likely missile, laser, non-seeking projectile),  Generator Cores  Mining Cores  Intel Cores(Radar/Counter Intel)  Etc  All of these connect to each other with the main core at the center, forming a grid system that is connected and interdependent. More on the grid system will come out soon, and feel free to ask me any questions about the system in the mean time!"
Unity2D,37a812,would_tap,2,Tue May 26 03:11:07 2015 UTC,"What type of game are you trying to make?

Instead, I did it by using a switch (or if statements) with 4 basic options:  your X > their X, your X < their X, your Y > their Y, your Y < their Y  to figure out whether I should be moving up/down/left/right to get closer."

Unity2D,37a812,Storyboar,1 point,Tue May 26 05:48:31 2015 UTC,"Depends, the first bit has a call to the second function, so you COULD use that, or just change the line:  GameObject target = Get_Closest_Player(transform.position);   to be like you've done in your code.  In my game the sprites only have 4 directions they face (you could have more,), so I'm not rotating them, rather I'm moving the position directly (because it's multiplayer I'm handling collision etc myself) with the line:  transform.position += target_direction * movement_speed * Time.deltaTime;   In your case your pointing your sprite in the direction you want to go, then translating it forward. If you remove the rotate part then the sprite will just go the direction it was facing when it was instantiated. If you don't want to rotate the sprite, then you need to find the direction to the sprite (I have that line in my code above), then move it in that direction, rather than just moving it forward (see unity documentation for translate for what I mean - http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Translate.html).

Unity2D,3752yr,nicloay,1 point,Mon May 25 09:46:08 2015 UTC,This solution seems pretty nice and I haven't seen it done this way before. What happens for floating platforms though? It seems that you would need at least two colliders on the platform (one ground layer and one ceiling layer) and probably two more for the sides.
Unity2D,3752yr,mjholtzem,1 point,Mon May 25 13:36:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly I hasn't used this thing in production, just seen this method before in release notes and want to try it out.

Unity2D,3752yr,nicloay,1 point,Mon May 25 21:13:28 2015 UTC,it depends on the speed of the rigid body and the size of your bounds collider  you can see on github page that i have 2 colliders ]bounds+ground_check
Unity2D,3752yr,nicloay,1 point,Tue May 26 05:31:04 2015 UTC,"What I mean to say is that if your collider is the size of your character (and even if it isn't), you're going to have issues with the bool becoming true when the players head touches a ceiling or the side of a platform, as isTouchingLayers would return true in those cases."
Unity2D,3752yr,nicloay,1 point,Tue May 26 13:22:37 2015 UTC,"i'm not getting you. how it would happens. touch event is checked only for circle collider. when you hit the ceiling or sides box collider will fired first, because it's larger than circle, and internal collider won't touch ceiling or side int this case.   I know that physics engine has an issue and can't like if you hight to high speed it can't interpolate the value correctly and miss collision. but this issue would happens for raycasts as well because your check this value in fixed update as well."
Unity2D,3752yr,RedMolo,1 point,Tue May 26 16:25:53 2015 UTC,"Looking at your picture again, I can now see what you are getting at... But wouldn't there now be an issue if the player is on the edge of a platform/cliff? Like, the circle collider would no longer be touching anything (so isGrounded will be false), but your box collider causes you to hang of the edge the cliff, meaning your technically still grounded?"
Unity2D,3752yr,Trevallion,1 point,Tue May 26 18:39:33 2015 UTC,"yes, it's an issue, but it could be solved by different type of collider. rectangle or mesh collider to handle the slopes. or you can add two small circle colliders (like a wheels of the car). Or you can create something like a capsule collider where bottom part would be a circle with ground check and middle pat a rectangle where width would be a little bit bigger than diameter of the circle."
Unity2D,3752yr,RedMolo,3,Wed May 27 05:14:30 2015 UTC,"So I've used the stuff from a game project I'm currently working on but it's still my own work. The code can be found here and there is an image of the object setup so that you can better visualize how the code works here  There is also a small playable demo here  I used the Physics2D overlapCircle because it is simple and returns a boolean which means I can set my grounded variable simply and quickly, the only downside is that if I land on the very edge of a platform the collider will stop me from falling off but the overlapCircle function might still return false, but that is something I will have to fix at a later date. I hope you enjoy my entry  EDIT: So i spent some time adding some more level pieces and implementing a double jump just as part of development, there's also some funky music from Incompetech: 8 bit Dungeon Level.  Here is the new demo"
Unity2D,3752yr,Skaffel,1 point,Mon May 25 13:55:56 2015 UTC,"That's interesting! When I did this before I had 3 different sets of objects in the front, back, and center of my character object. Each set of objects was the start and end of a raycast. The character was considered grounded if any of the raycasts returned true, that way he could still jump for a split second after running off a ledge. I never thought to use overlapCircle but it would have made things wayyyy simpler!"
Unity2D,3752yr,RedMolo,1 point,Mon May 25 14:57:57 2015 UTC,What you could do it use two different overlap circles and then you'd get al the benefits of your method (detection even on partial ground) and the simplicity of overlap circle.  It's always nice to solve a problem and then see how other people solved it differently
Unity2D,3752yr,Skaffel,1 point,Mon May 25 15:05:52 2015 UTC,I am doing the exact same thing as you do except with OverlapArea instead. Is there a reason you are using OverlapCircle?  Edit: The reason to use OverlapArea being to solve the edge problem

Unity2D,37437s,Cabskee,2,Sun May 24 18:40:13 2015 UTC,"The speed actually does slowly increase. The video probably wasn't long enough to see it, but after each one is spawned the speed is increased by 1.1x. Do you think the speed multiplier should be increased so it gets faster quicker?"
Unity2D,37437s,Cabskee,3,Sun May 24 18:54:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think so. The video was about a minute thirty and the speed increase can barely be noticed by the end.  Of course you could always keep the speed how it is, and just start introducing 2 balls - One on one side, and the other on the other, but slightly displaced, so the player has to figure out which is closer and quickly jump in between.  But those are just my 2 cents. I really like quick kneejerk games like that, and this definitely has the potential."

Even if you went on for a long time and it got really fast, yeah, it would be intense, but the visuals and the feel is just... boring.  Maybe instead of the balls just vanishing instantly when they touch a paddle, have a little animation where they burst and the screen shakes a little bit.  Also this reminds me a lot of Planet Plop on iOS. You should check it out, it's a lot of fun, and... really difficult."

Unity2D,373aa9,Sellador_,3,Sun May 24 15:08:20 2015 UTC,"Looks good so far! (Did you rip the mp5 gunshot from Counter-Strike? :P) I'm impressed by the quality of the particle effects and blood decals, the character rotation and the decapitation of the enemies are nice little details. But I think you posted this here for constructive criticism so here it goes, don't take it the wrong way.  Some things irk me when I imagine playing your prototype, some minor and some major. First off and most importantly, I believe the plattforming, especially the jumping mechanics need some tweaking. Your video gives the impression that if you're jumping, your character only stops accelerating upwards after a set amount of time. IMO plattformer feel much more responsive and intuitive when you can vary the height of your jump by tapping/holding the jump button. Also it seems that there is a minor bug at 0:44 when your character descends from the dumpster.   Secondly, and this one is purely subjective, the enemies look way too bullet-spongy. Your blood effects give the hits a nice visceral feel but the amount of shots it takes for an enemy to be killed is somewhat contradictory. You can still tweak the difficulty changing the number of enemies or the damage they deal.   Really try to make the basics of your game as fun and responsive as possible before you spend too much time on less important aspects. Additionally, I can wholeheartedly recommend Mark Brown's video on game feel (and the rest of his series) regarding this subject. He puts all these things way better than I could with my limited experience as a game designer."

Very nice find at 0:44 where the slope multiplier kicks in a bit too much. But it's what I will put my main focus on, and the general feel of the game.

I take computer science at college and one of the things that I find the most annoying and useful is breaking the problem down into smaller and smaller steps. So you want RPG combat, that breaks down into player turn and enemy turn, that requires inputs and AI, the AI might require looking at the enemy health and deciding whether to heal or attack, and then the healing might break down into checking whether the enemy has enough healing potions etc. You break the problem down into smaller and smaller pieces until each tiny piece can be turned into a single line of code, or a single procedure.  A lot of people say start small but I think if you have a project in mind push yourself, tackle each tiny bit one at a time until you realise your project in full. Refer to the documentation and ask questions on forums or reddit (getting some help isn't against the rules). Believe in yourself and see how far you can go!"

Unity2D,3708u8,Abysinian,2,Sat May 23 17:34:08 2015 UTC,This is a common issue with Unity of which I found two fixes.   1) in your sprite sheet extrude each sprite by duplicating the outside pixels. For example if each sprite is now 16x16 you want to make each 18x18 with duplicate sprites on the outside.   2) use the sprite packer feature in unity 5 to handle the above for you automatically. In your sprites import settings you can give your sprites a packing tag name and unity should handle the extrudion stuff automatically. At least it does for me.   I'm probably going to write a blog post on this issue soon as it took me quite a while to come up with a good solution to this.

If you're casting a ray downwards, then when it collides and you're grounded, reset the friction to what you would like it to be when grounded.  When you call your jump set the friction to 0.

If not, you don't even need physics collisions as you can just validate movement against your wall data.  But if there is wiggle room, your polygon colliders should have worked just fine.  Perhaps your player movement is the issue here.  If you move the transform, you can easily force an object through a wall as transform movement doesn't check for collisions.

Show something that will make people feel like a happy supporter, instead of making you look like a desperate beggar. I don't mean any offense by that, it's just a random metaphor..  Hope you succeed with this! Just try to understand how people think. They don't care about your product like you do because they aren't investing the time and passion into creating it that you are. So while you might care about the screenshots because you know how much work went into everything that created them, people on the outside don't care. How long did it take to program the platform jumping? Who cares. How long to create the art work? Who cares. How many times did you get frustrated and want to quit? Who cares. What's the story about? What does this game do that I can't do in other games? Who's this old guy? What's special about the tree? We're in the Twitter age, you have SECONDS to tell me every important thing I need to know about your game before my attention is grabbed by something else.   Using gifs is a good start, but nothing exciting is happening in them. I've seen player movement. I've seen pretty trees. I've seen jumping on the sides of platforms.

I've been working on social mobile apps like this professionally for the past 3 years now, stupid, STUPID amounts of money go into them. I'm speaking of slot games, card games, basically any casino-like game. I've seen some and been involved with some incredibly innovative technology that these ""little"" apps have behind the scenes and their scopes are very ambitious.  My teams have ranged from 4-8 programmers who normally are very senior level engineers and an equal amount of artists. QA, sound, design, and managers to deal with all that as well. A bare bones MVP will release in just a handful of months, depending on scope, with a team like I've described. Easily a few 100k go into that process alone when you think of average salary, benefits, hardware and software, etc.... Then when you bring in UA, you go into the millions quickly if you want to compete with the big players. There are more costs that go into maintenance as well, I've also seen money go into 3rd party technologies and support costs of said technologies, etc...  Many people sorely underestimate what it takes to make games of this caliber and to then make them run on every device and platform under the sun. It's no easy task. Games like this truly have more than meets the eye behind them and are currently one of the most profitable games on mobile devices for that reason.

Unity2D,36tr9g,OhGreyFox,1 point,Fri May 22 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"For pretty much everything you've asked/talked about, I'd highly recommend doing some more research in Mechanim on the 3D side. Afterall, aside from frame-based (sprite sheet) based animations, the system is exactly the same. I believe what you're looking for is akin to avatars, skeletons, and (notably): blend-trees.  Yeah, things still won't work or feel right, but you can get some interesting results nonetheless. And there is nothing wrong with a single animator controller... You'd find lots of games use singular animation controllers: Once you dig down into mechanim more and more, you'll find there's various ways to ""clean up the clutter"" so to speak.   but I can't find any examples of overriding animations with 2D games.   Do you mean overriding sprite-sheet/frame-based animations?"
Unity2D,36tr9g,kreaol,1 point,Fri May 22 05:56:02 2015 UTC,"Specifically, I meant overriding the animation that a body part is undergoing, without stopping the previous animation.  An example would be a common use case of a player running, then clicking a button to swing. The player would still move their legs as though they were running, but there arms would have an animation temporarily ""overriding"". I could of course make separate animations for every combination, but that's not ideal. I'll look into the 3D side a lot more today though, admittedly I haven't given it a serious look because I didn't think many of the features would be available.  I believe I understand blend trees, and I was going to incorporate the blend trees with the overriding layer. Like if a player is running at a speed value of 50, the leg animations would override to the associated animation in the running blend tree.  I hope I communicated my thoughts well there haha but I'm going to look more at the documentation and do some research. I've also thought about making nested states for running, idle, attacking, etc but it begins to get complex very early in development and I don't know how well that could scale!"

Using this animator parameter you can control the transitions from the other animations (walking/idle etc) into the attacking animations (documentation regarding transitions - http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StateMachineTransitions.html).   Usage - set up transition to attackPatternAnimation0 to be when attackPattern==0, attackPatternAnimation1 when attackPattern==1 and so on.  Now that the transitions are set, you now just need to set the attackPattern variable within code, randomising from 0 - totalAttackAnimations - 1 (how to do this in code is also within the animation parameters documentation). You don't have to randomise either, you could set up a pattern to follow (within an array) or simple AI (if far away from player stop shooting and fly towards them)"

Unity2D,36qwkv,contradictorycreatio,4,Thu May 21 12:19:49 2015 UTC,"I am in the middle of a similar game. Without a doubt hand drawn animation will look best. There are some other factors to consider however. As previously stated, you have to consider your budget (time & money) for hand drawn. I don't have much budget so I invested in an animation plugin, Puppet2D. I can't say its the best, it could use some improvements, but its affordable. Its ability to do mesh distortions bridges enough of the quality gap for me to use it rather than hand animate. There are other plugins that could be better, I wouldn't consider any plugin that couldn't do mesh deformations of some sort.  Using spline animation will save considerable time. Unity's state machine also takes work out of animation transitions too if using splines. You can let the engine figure out the few frames that go between standing, running and jumping.  Another thing to consider is performance. Fighting game characters are generally quite large on screen. If you're targeting mobile, consider that some devices have a texture limitation of 2048x2048. If your character is around 1024, that's only 4 frames on one texture before you have to swap. If you can manage a character that's 512, you can squeeze out 16 frames in one texture. Each texture means another draw call, 2d games should keep the number of draw calls to a minimum for best performance.  You can mix the techniques too if done carefully, hand animating part of a character, using splines for the rest. Like you could hand animate a scarf blowing in the wind, but the body is on splines. This has the potential to look weirdly disjointed however, particularly if the frame rates differ. Final Fantasy Record Keeper is an example of this; the sprite characters and retro pixel graphics have a low frame rate, but the visual effects are done in engine and run much faster (took me a while to figure out why it looked strange lol).  Good luck with your project!"

You will need three separate physics layers here:   One for the Circle Collider  One for the Box Collider One for the Box ""walls""   Then you adjust the physics matrix to suite:   Circle layer should be able to collide with Box-Walls layer but not the Box layer Box-Walls layer should not be able to collide with the Box layer Box layer should not be able to interact with either the Circle or Box-Walls Layer (should be already set if you did the above)   In your script for cutting, I assume that you are using Raycasts. As such, you can setup a LayerMask to allow for raycasting against the box/circle layers but NOT the box-wall layers.  That's just an idea: You'll probably have issues figuring out what to do with the walls when the box is cut though ;)"
Unity2D,36nish,theothersteve7,1 point,Wed May 20 19:22:26 2015 UTC,"This could be my solution, box walls shouldn't be too much of an issue if i do this right, cause after cutting the box, level should be fail or success so i might get away with this :) Thanks for the suggestion."
Unity2D,36nish,Harabeck,2,Wed May 20 20:22:02 2015 UTC,"Either I'm missing something or this is really obvious.  You need to make the box hollow.  I recommend four rectangles, one for each side."

Unity2D,36o1zj,LordHamburger,3,Wed May 20 20:03:14 2015 UTC,I would do it as a separate scene. It's easier to not mess up and doesn't really add any/much overhead. You can even load the next scene in the background as an async operation and switch it on soon as the cut scene is done.

Unity2D,36n4bx,HarryHayes,4,Wed May 20 16:27:10 2015 UTC,"For infinite runners, you spawn the backgrounds and other objects to one side of the camera, move them across the camera's view and the speed of your player (who remains stationary), and then recycle them when they're off screen.  (Note: You don't need to do object pooling to get started, but you will eventually.)  First, you need an array of backgrounds.  Each background should either A)  seamlessly connect to any other background or B) know what connector to use to connect to any other background.  A is easier but B is more flexible.  Either way, essentially you simply randomly grab a new background section as you need it and place it at the end.  Renderer.Bounds is your friend.  Next, you need to keep an array of object layouts as prefabs.  The background keeps a reference to a list of layouts it can use and when it's spawned, it spawns one of the object layout prefabs accordingly.  So basically, in update you would do something like this:   Move all backgrounds and objects to the left at the speed of the player For each background and object, when the right side of its renderer is to the left of the left side of the screen1, recycle it: If there are no backgrounds or if the right side of the most recently spawned background is to the left of the right of the screen2, spawn a new background and an object layout on top of it:   Reference code:  1. Camera.main.WorldToScreenPoint(new Vector3(renderer.bounds.max.x, renderer.bounds.center.y, renderer.bounds.center.z)) < 0 2. Camera.main.WorldToScreenPoint(new Vector3(lastBackground.renderer.bounds.max.x, lastBackground.renderer.bounds.center.y, lastBackground.renderer.bounds.center.z)) <= Screen.width"

Unity2D,36n4bx,VicareyG,2,Wed May 20 21:10:43 2015 UTC,Why not just randomly place the obstacles? That way the background can stay the same and loop without needing to change. Just have the ceiling/floor obstacles generate just to the right of the screen and destroy them as they leave the left of the screen.    Edit: have a look at this tutorial by Catlike Coding that generates platforms as a player runs. All you'd have to do is generate platforms at the top and bottom of the screen. The algorithm could be easily transferred to 2D sprites if you're working in 2D.
Unity2D,36n4bx,VicareyG,2,Wed May 20 20:34:13 2015 UTC,"Why didn't I think of that. So I'd just make a background, then the rocky spikes of the ""cave"" in sets of 2/3 spikes each and make them randomize one after the other to merge into a roof/floor. I'll look into it thanks."
Unity2D,36n4bx,iamallamaa,1 point,Wed May 20 20:38:25 2015 UTC,Exactly like that. By doing it this way you'd be able to progressively make the level harder the farther along a player gets by increasing the frequency that spikes are generated.
Unity2D,36n4bx,marksizzle,1 point,Wed May 20 20:41:15 2015 UTC,Sounds like the beta smart sprite feature would work well. Does anyone with the beta know if you can add/edit a smart sprite mesh at runtime? Even if not adding any more vertices but just changing the existing ones.
Unity2D,36n4bx,joshplaskett,1 point,Wed May 20 16:59:13 2015 UTC,I'm new here too but couldn't you just save multiple scenes that contain different obstacles and then load then scene once you hit a transition point?  I don't know how seamless that would be. You don't want the user to know that there has been a transition.  Vets of Unity feel free to teach me if I am wrong because I'm a newb thats trying to learn too.

Unity2D,36kk6h,bFusion,1 point,Wed May 20 02:35:45 2015 UTC,As I am playing through the level i get the players position and store it in an array. Then to make the ghost do the same thing I just go through the array. It seems really simple but i had tried a couple other methods that failed for one reason or another. So when I read about doing it this way I decided to try it out. Works flawlessly so far.
Unity2D,36kk6h,bFusion,2,Wed May 20 02:39:53 2015 UTC,"I am thinking about a game using ""ghost"" recordings as well. Did you save the array as a frame-by-frame recording or do you have interpolation between points in there? I was thinking just recording any inputs at X milliseconds into the game (to compensate for a variable framerate), but I don't know if that will be more or less work to render out in the end. Would love to hear more about this process if you are willing to share! :)"
Unity2D,36kk6h,ricewarrior21,2,Wed May 20 04:20:09 2015 UTC,"Of course. Initially I tried storing the input data the way you mention. The problem I ran into with that method was that if the time the event fired for the ghost was delayed by even 0.01 seconds the playback could have a noticeably different outcome than the original. I couldn't have that in this game so I searched for another route. I store the position in an array every frame from FixedUpdate(). I send the data to a game manager so i can retrieve it easily from my ghost. I don't any interpolation between points, I just set the ghosts position every frame using the array. I have not noticed any kind of performance issues with storing and setting it every frame. I have had a maximum of five ghosts going though so  I am not sure how well it will scale. Any questions I didn't answer please just let me know. Also I can upload a simple script if you would like to see how exactly I did it. Just give me a shout."

It's cool because people always have wanted SVG support with unity, but $125 is a lot for a ""quality of life"" plugin (could always pre-render them) that doesn't support the full SVG feature set.  Also, if rendering is done at runtime only, this means longer game startup time and no use of often essential  texture hardware compression like DXT5, ETC2, PVRTC, etc."
Unity2D,36lop5,Wisteso,1 point,Wed May 20 15:37:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback. We thought that 125$ could be the right pricetag for a technology that took 2 fulltime developers for 1year (SVG parsing/rendering and Unity scripts) based upon a technology that took 2 fulltime developers for 3/4 years (native lowlevel OpenVG rendering engine). Maybe the price could be a little higher for casual indie game programmer, but really low for a company. So maybe we can try to differentiate those cases in the future.  Yes, the plugin could be improoved, features added, ... but I think that at the moment, SVGAssets is quite good in terms of SVG feature, supported platforms, texture packing, execution speed and so on, and it's the only viable solution to render SVG at runtime on the device."

Mouse movement = player movement (which means if you move mouse to the right, the character will move to the right, etc). The character will always face the boss, but you have only autoattack."

Unity2D,36eqxt,kreaol,1 point,Tue May 19 03:05:14 2015 UTC,Maybe Its becasue of the layout error I got when opening the project but is there supposed to be just 4 colored cubes and the C# code in the assets?
Unity2D,36eqxt,kreaol,2,Tue May 19 05:14:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's it really... There should be a scene for you to open as well. Go into 3D view, and you can then better see the eye followers and stuff (there should be some gizmos to help orient current positions of things).  The concept is that the pupil of each eye is set to move within a clamped area of the main ""eye"" for that pupil. Their positions are determined by a few things: Each pupil follows an empty ""pupil controller"" object, with their X and Y position values being a factor of the current Z position of said controller. Additionally, the controller for each pupil will move closer to the center of the ""overall eye"" controller the closer the ""overall"" controller moves towards the eye on the Z axis. This is done via lerp and usage of the ""maxZ"" variable (at work now, can't recall what I used for the variable name). It's the first 2-3 lines in the Update() function I believe.  Conceptually speaking, as an object moves closer to your eyes, your eyes react/move more to keep up with said object. When an object is farther away, your eyes will make smaller adjustments to ""focus"" or follow an object."
Unity2D,36eqxt,kreaol,1 point,Tue May 19 14:00:11 2015 UTC,"Ah now I understand, ya the scene provided in the assets had nothing in the hierarchy at all so I'm assuming it just imported improperly when I opened the project.

The basic idea is changing the sorting layer in the renderer component via code. Yell back at me tomorrow if you still haven't figured this out and I'll post some code.  I believe there is still some requirement on z position for the text to be visible by the camera as well. Again I'll look into this tomorrow when I can get on my computer.
Unity2D,36etpd,charlie4lyfe,1 point,Tue May 19 02:25:56 2015 UTC,I tried something along the lines of adding a renderer component and modifying the sorting layer from there. Then attaching all the meshes as children but I didn't have any luck.  Any guidance would be awesome!
Unity2D,36etpd,charlie4lyfe,3,Wed May 20 00:27:12 2015 UTC,"Basically just make sure the 3D text is in front of the camera (usually just put it at a z of 0, if camera is at -10 make sure text's z is greater than that) and then attach this script to your 3D text object. Then in the inspector type the layername that you want the text to go on. Make sure this is an existing sorting layer and that this is a layer that is in front of the ones you want the text to show up in front of.   using UnityEngine; using System.Collections;  public class Push3DtoFront : MonoBehaviour  {     public string layerToPushTo;      void Start ()      {         GetComponent<Renderer>().sortingLayerName = layerToPushTo;         //Debug.Log(GetComponent<Renderer>().sortingLayerName);     } }   Let me know if this works/doesn't or if you need more help."

Covers branching dialogs. LUA scripting for dialogs making decisions about stuff or setting variables. Importing from industry standard programs such as Articy: draft or ChatMapper (my fav) or even includes it's own node based dialog builder. Comes with a complete quest system for tracking quest status. Support and examples for pretty much every UI system out there plus wizards to set it all up if it is a little much for you.

Unity2D,36c369,Juggernaut_N,3,Mon May 18 04:34:28 2015 UTC,"So it seems like it is trying to get a 1:1 ratio of game pixels to screen pixels so there is no random pixel rounding. So if the camera it is on is orthographic, it first gets a scaling amount by dividing the height by the number of pixels to the number of vertical pixels of the screen. Then it applies that to how many pixels you want to be represented by a unit. Finally it adjusts the height of the camera by this new ratio to get the correct number of pixels per unit. In this code you've put up is 1 unit : 1 pixel.  The thing this fixes is if you have more pixels per screen height on your actual camera, it may distort images and things like that."
Unity2D,36c369,Tortgurt,2,Mon May 18 05:02:06 2015 UTC,"This script is scaling your orthographic camera's height to match the height of specific screen resolution. Scripts like this are often used in low resolution pixel art games.  It's mislabeled as PixelPerfectCamera. This won't display your game as ""pixel perfect"" and won't fix any pixel stretching issues caused by the nativeResolution.y not dividing evenly into Screen.height.  If you'd still like to use this code, this:  public float pixelsToUnits = 1f; public Vector2 nativeResolution = new Vector2 (240, 160);  // Use this for initialization void Awake () {     var camera = GetComponent<Camera>();      if (camera.orthographic)     {         camera.orthographicSize = nativeResolution.y / 2f / pixelsToUnits;     } }   will give you the same result with less math."

Unity2D,36bi8n,Randommook,1 point,Mon May 18 02:19:42 2015 UTC,The FPS controller was intended for people to just drop into a scene and start testing their game.  If you really want to make a 2D controller it would be more productive for you to just write your own basic controller for your needs rather than trying to re-purpose a giant controller that wasn't intended for you.  Writing a simple 2D controller only takes a few lines of code so it's far easier to just write one up for yourself and you'll ultimately learn more.
Unity2D,36bpd5,NonaBona,4,Mon May 18 02:15:56 2015 UTC,"You could just use Invoke instead.  no need to mess around with Coroutines.

Invoke is a super easy way of calling a function after an X second delay.  If you are dead set on using a Coroutine then you have to put            gameOverPanel.SetActive(true);          panelScore.text = score.text;         bestScore.text = highScore.text;          if(scorescript.NewBest)         {             newText.enabled = true;         }   Inside your Coroutine function under your WaitForSeconds function or it will immediately execute.

Unity2D,36bpd5,Randommook,1 point,Mon May 18 02:30:05 2015 UTC,Invoke sounds simpler.And I place it in the Update() function correct?  I tried it but it still doesn't wait for the amount set.
Unity2D,36bpd5,Randommook,3,Mon May 18 02:44:33 2015 UTC,"If you are Invoking something inside the Update function then it is getting invoked repeatedly every single frame.  You only need to call Invoke once. Same with Coroutines. You should not be calling the Coroutine every single frame either.  The way it's usually done is to have a Game Manager object with a script attached to it that has functions responsible for killing the player and respawning the player and so when the player dies the GameManager.PlayerDeath() function gets called and if the PlayerDeath function determines that the player has no more lives left then it calls the GameOver() function. You don't want those sorts of functions just sitting in the Update function.  Here's a simple example:  Hurt Player Script:   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other) {       if(other.name == ""Player"") {            PlayerHealthManager.GiveDamage(1);       }  }   Player Health Manager Script:   public static int playerHealth;  public static int maxPlayerHealth = 3;  public static bool isDead;  public GameManager gameManager;   void Start() {       playerHealth = maxPlayerHealth;       gameManager = FindObjectOfType<GameManager>(); //There is only one of these in your scene so you can just assign it like this  }   void Update() {       if (!isDead && playerHealth <= 0) {            playerHealth = 0;            isDead = true; //Stops this function from getting called more than once            gameManager.Death(); //Call the death function in the Game Manager so it can handle all the little details about whether to respawn the player or call Game Over       }  }   public static void GiveDamage (int damageGiven) {       playerHealth -= damageGiven;  }   public static void ResetHealth () {       playerHealth = maxPlayerHealth;  }   Game Manager Script:   public PlayerController playerController;  public Renderer playerRenderer;  public int availableRespawns;   void Start () {       playerController = FindObjectOfType<PlayerController>();       playerRenderer = playerController.GetComponent<Renderer>();  }   public void Death () {       playerController.enabled = false;       playerRenderer.enabled = false;       if (availableRespawns > 0) {            Invoke(""Respawn"", 1);            availableRespawns -= 1;       } else {            Invoke(""GameOver"", 2);       }  }   void Respawn () {       //Don't have time to write out all this so use your imagination  }   void GameOver () {       //Make your Game Over Screen appear here  }"

Unity2D,36bpd5,Randommook,2,Mon May 18 18:44:25 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure so I did a quick test and the answer is yes.  If you invoke something and set the time to 5 seconds and then set your TimeScale to 0.5 then it will take it 10 realtime seconds before the event is set off.  You can test it yourself by making a ""Hello World"" debug message function and Invoking that function in Start after setting TimeScale to .5 and you will notice it takes it twice as long before it sends the Debug message.  If you want to get around this issue you can multiply the time part of the Invoke function by your TimeScale. So for example if you had Invoke(""HelloWorld"", 5 * Time.timeScale) then it would always end up being around 5 seconds of real time unless your timescale was set to 0. This should only really end up being a problem if you set your TimeScale to 0 or if you change your TimeScale after Invoke has already been called and is still counting down."
Unity2D,36bpd5,Randommook,1 point,Mon May 18 19:02:12 2015 UTC,"So, create an empty game object and attach a GameManagerScript to it.

Also, is there somewhere I can learn more about Game Manager Objects and using it to interact between other scripts?"
Unity2D,36bpd5,Randommook,2,Mon May 18 03:06:51 2015 UTC,I wrote up some example code in my earlier comment to give you an idea of what the code would look like. There's probably some mistakes in it but it should give you a general idea of how to make a basic health and Death/GameOver system.  You should always try to break your scripts into simple small scripts that have clear responsibilities. That way you don't end up with 1 giant script that has to manage everything from the Player's health to the player's movement and deaths and score.   Then check if player has died and call the GameOver() function using invoke.   You should only really have to check if the player is dead if the player has a health system and if the Player has a health system then the player needs a HealthManager script. For any game with instant death you can just call the death function directly whenever the player gets hit.

Unity2D,36bpd5,nventimiglia,2,Mon May 18 03:32:40 2015 UTC,"GameObject.Find(""Name1"").GetComponent<Script1>() searches for a game object on your scene named Name1 and then searches the components of that Object for a component of type Script1. It's good if you have multiple objects that all have the same script but you want to access the script on a specific one of those objects with a unique name.  FindObjectOfType<Script1>() just finds an object in your scene that has Script1 attached to it and the reason I was able to use it was because there's only 1 player in the entire scene and it's the only object with a PlayerController script attached to it (and the same with the PlayerHealthManager and the GameManager) so I just have to tell it to look for that specific script and it will always find my Player. You can't use FindObjectOfType when you have multiple objects that all have the same component you are searching for."

Learning about stuff like Invoke vs StartCoroutine is mainly just personal preference that you'll pick up over time from googling stuff and watching different tutorials.  I would recommend watching lots of tutorials and finding a way of doing things that makes sense to you. For most things in Unity there are lots of different ways you can accomplish the same task so lots of people have their own tricks so watching lots of tutorials will help you find elegant ways to code something.

Unity2D,36b7ik,AniMoney,2,Mon May 18 00:30:35 2015 UTC,I was interested in this topic too. Many games on mobile like Hill Climb racing have this type of curvy terrain.  I believe you can make meshes from splines or bezier curves in Unity but I don't think there's a way to make the splines in the editor. Doing it in code isn't very intuitive.

Unity2D,36b7ik,Kinths,2,Mon May 18 08:16:38 2015 UTC,"The way I usually handle procedural generation is to have a spawner object that places pieces down. In the spawner you have a bit of code that changes the direction the object is moving in. So you have it move right to left and then have a bit of code that randomly changes the rotation by a small amount to create a curve. Set up a clamp on the values so the changes aren't too sudden and so it can't end up going backwards.  As for gaps you have build a timer and once that timer hits 0 just have the spawner not place any terrain. Just remember to destroy terrain once it is out of view otherwise the game will just get slower until it stops.   There are many ways of doing procedural generation you just have to look into techniques and see what works for you.    When it comes to procedural generation the best thing to do is just try different things and see which works best for you.   My process is usually build something simple, iterate upon it till it does what I want and then rewrite it, because by that point the code is usually horrible to follow :P"

This is a bad idea :) You want to use object pooling instead. Instantiating and Destroying game objects will cause your game to slow down over time.
Unity2D,36b7ik,Skaffel,-1,Tue May 19 22:04:41 2015 UTC,"i am not a complete beginner :) thanks for the advice though, i did many procedural generated games in the past, and in all of them i create objects and then ""randomly"" place them based on different rules. Am asking about dynamic terrain generation, the easy way i could think about is to create a mesh, make it curvy, place it in the scene, then create another mesh with different curves and place it right next to the previous one. My question was on how to create that mesh, or maybe another object type since this is 2d but i don't think there is a way in unity to achieve this without MeshFilter. Thanks"
Unity2D,36b7ik,autowikibot,1 point,Mon May 18 00:29:51 2015 UTC,"I made a ""curvy"" procedural system in about a day, so not that hard to do the basics. Each curve is actually just a bunch of line segments. To make each curve I used (Quadratic) Bézier curves.   Here is my code for linearising the Bézier curve. It takes three points and a resolution and returns a vector of points (the line segments). It is a recursive function and has a bunch of other arguments as well, like start and end (which are simply 0 and 1), and left and right (which are simply p1, and p3) for the initial call.   So in the beginning you need to choose three points, lets call them; p11, p12 and p13, to create a Bézier curve. The next step is to create the next curve, using a new set of three points, p21, p22 and p23. The second curve start right after the first, ie p13 = p21. We also want the seam to be smooth, ie the derivative of the two curves at p13 and p21 have to be equal to each other.   The general derivative is:   B'(t) = 2(1-t) * (p2 - p1) + 2t * (p3 - p2)   The two curves are equal for t=1 and t=0 for the first and second curve respectively. This gives:  p13 - p12 = p22 - p21    And since p13 = p21:  p22 = 2 * p13 - p12.    p23 can be chosen completely randomly, but to make it work in a game it will have some restrictions. One common restriction is that p22 have to be placed between p21 and p23 for example.   The line segments you get from each Bézier curve are used to create the colliders and mesh. I use an edge collider for the collider. For the mesh, the easiest way is to create a parallelogram for each line segment (but it depends on the graphics). The tricky part is to get the UV mapping correct for the graphics you want.   I hope I make sense and that it is helpful. Skinning the terrain with different layers and to decorate it with objects etc will of course take longer time.   I also noticed I spelt Bézier curve wrong in my code 0_o."
Unity2D,36b7ik,bryankek,1 point,Sat May 30 23:33:36 2015 UTC,"Bézier curve:       A Bézier curve is a parametric curve frequently used in computer graphics and related fields. Generalizations of Bézier curves to higher dimensions are called Bézier surfaces, of which the Bézier triangle is a special case.  In vector graphics, Bézier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely. ""Paths"", as they are commonly referred to in image manipulation programs,  are combinations of linked Bézier curves. Paths are not bound by the limits of rasterized images and are intuitive to modify.  Bézier curves are also used in the time domain, particularly in animation and user interface  design. For example a Bézier curve can be used to specify the velocity over time of an object such as an icon moving from A to B, rather than simply moving at a fixed number of pixels per step. When animators or interface designers talk about the ""physics"" or ""feel"" of an operation, they may be referring to the particular Bézier curve used to control the velocity over time of the move in question.

For the elements scrolling, make a simple script and attach it to each element. Make a public variable called something like ""movementSpeed"", and give each of your elements a different speed value. In your script, you could have a simple one-liner like:   transform.position += Vector3.left * (movementSpeed * Time.deltaTime);   Also in the script, detect how far to the left the element has moved. When it has moved too far to the left, you can just re-position it to the right again, maybe even do a Random.Range(minValue,maxValue) to the movementSpeed variable to make it have a new speed, and it will automatically start moving to the left again."

For more specific advice, we'd need to know more about your game. Are the tiles all touching? Is every space in the grid filled? Can a point in the grid have multiple tiles?

From there you'll be able to manipulate the vertices/triangles of the object's mesh to achieve the desired effect.  I've not done any Mesh manipulation in Unity myself so there may be others who can give you more specific advice. Perhaps looking for this class being used on youtube might be a good starting point.  Hope this helps!

In other words, make sure you have an idea where you want to go.   As you said, you can do some art... well, that is one part. The other part is the sofware. You will have to learn to write some code. Start a simple dumb project, and give yourself a 'easy' task. For instance, make some objects move, fall or react to other objects. Get some beginner C# tutorials and from there try to create the dumb project. After that, start adding stuff to the dumb project until you think you are ready for the big work. Don't try to create your game if you haven't covered the basics of learning C# first. It's a growing process that you need to do step by step."

Unity2D,363q4c,Nimr0D14,2,Fri May 15 21:16:34 2015 UTC,"That will never reach newIntensity. You have a pretty common misconception about lerp. The arguments you should pass in are better described as:   Starting value Ending value Percentage (0.0 to 1.0) between the start and end values.   Imagine you have to walk 100 feet and each ""update"" you only move 10%. With your code, your first update you pass in 0 (current position) and 100 (final position) and 0.1 (percentage), it will return 10 because that is 10% of 100 (total distance). On the second update you are passing in 10 (current position), 100 (final position) and 0.1 (percentage) but you will only move 9 feet this time because you are moving 10% of the distance you passed in which is 90. See the problem, you are moving only 0.1 of the remaining distance, not the initial distance. After 10 updates you are at ~65 feet along but only moving 3 feet at an update. What you want to do is pass in the same start and end values (0 and 100 from example) but pass in an increasing percentage. Lerp, by itself, isn't supposed to ease or smooth toward another. It is meant to move at a constant rate between two values. However you can use stuff like animation curves on your percentage value to ease if wanted.  Edit: If I were doing this, my script would look something like this (I do not have access to Unity right now so this might not work.  public float startIntensity = 0f; public float stopIntensity = 0f;  public float duration = 0f; public float elapsed = 0f;  void Start() {     //startup our initial values     NextIntensity(); }  void Update() {     //if we haven't reached our final intensity     if(playerLight.intensity != stopIntensity)     {         //increase our elapsed time by the delta time         elapsed += Time.deltaTime;          //lerp the light intensity         playerLight.intensity = Mathf.Lerp(startIntensity, stopIntensity, elapsed / duration);     } else {         //destination reached, get next values         NextIntensity();     } }  void NextIntensity() {     //reset our start to the current intensity     startIntensity = playerLight.intensity;     //random value for stop intensity     stopIntensity = Random.Range(1f, 4f);     //random value for duration (seconds to perform transition)     duration = Random.Range(0.1f, 1.0f); }"

I had no prior experience with IAP but it's not hard to figure it out thanks to all of the questions and answers/video tutorials. The hardest part was figuring out how to make the same script work for both IOS and Android, but once I got comfortable with the whole #IF ANDROID context it's kinda just rewriting the same few lines of code with platform specific cases.  This project made me take an extra week and just make an AdMod prefab as well as an IAP prefab that (should) let me just drag and drop 2 prefabs onto the scene, change out the AdMod codes, the IAP codes and be good to go vs going through the process of relearning integration every new project.

Unity2D,360jvx,itzomeganexus,2,Fri May 15 01:56:56 2015 UTC,"If trying to recreate that game, I wouldn't use physics, gravity, rigid bodies...etc. I would just make each block 1 unit square in size and adjust the transform +/- 1 unit left/right side to side. Then when they press a stop key, have each block raycast down (you would need colliders, can likely sendMessage to child objects under parent container) and if a block isn't found underneath move down until bottom hit, flash and disappear."

Unity2D,360jvx,AniMoney,2,Fri May 15 11:59:51 2015 UTC,"Oh man I used to be addicted to a Stacker machine when I first discovered it on a cruise ship years ago! I later found out they were rigged :(  So you're on the right track with the prefabs, but you won't need rigidbodies at all. I mean you can have them but you're not going to be using the physics engine, so you'll want to set them to kinematic if you have them. You'll want to move your blocks using something like transform.translate, and just move them uniformly in the X direction, as if they were tiles locked on a grid.  In fact a grid of tiles is really how you should approach this, since the game itself is on a grid. Each block will have an (X,Y) coordinate on the grid. Stacker is something like 7 tiles wide by 12 tiles tall. So imagine a grid like battleship going from 1 to 7 horizontally and from 1 to 12 vertically. So your 3-piece block will start off in the bottom center occupying tiles (3,1), (4,1), and (5,1). They way you'd program this is with a 2D array, also sometimes called a multidimensional array. You can google this to figure out how they work, it's not too complicated. You'll also want to use nested for loops to sort through the X and Y.  In each update (or whatever timestep you use), you can have the blocks move left or right by changing their x-coordinate (moving them to another location in the array). Have a boolean for the direction they're moving in (right or left/ positive or negative), and check the if the x-coordinate is ever on either end of the array's length (1 or 7 on our grid, in this case, but since it's an array it'd be 0 and 6 because arrays start at 0), and switch direction. When the player presses stop, freeze that row's location, compare with the row below (current row's y-coordinate - 1) to see if they ""stacked"", delete any tiles that didn't, and start moving the next row.  For the visuals of the game just assign gameobject's transform.positions to match up with the array coordinates * the scale of your gameObject.  I've been up all night so some of this might be a bit sloppy or wrong but hopefully part of it helps."
Unity2D,360gmf,cygn_,3,Fri May 15 01:26:58 2015 UTC,"As usual there are many ways to create an effect, and I can't quite remember how it looks in Reus, so I'll just list some simple ideas you might be able to use based on your needs.   The simplest way might just be to build your world of sprites and rotate them around the planets center. So the player will stay static while the rotation of the planet creates the illusion of walking on the earth. If you actually want to move the player around the surface of the planet, you can just snap his position to the circumference of the planet. Basically you are walking along a path. You can either use a mathematical equation for circle/ellipse or trigonometry as your path representation or if your planet has bumps on the surface you might want to use splines to represent the path and interpolate along them. If you need physics, for instance for a platformer, you might want to look into a variable gravity direction. This will probably take more work, but you'll start by finding the direction from the player to the center of the planet, and then normalize it to the gravity pull force, and then update the gravity continuously.  Disclaimer: I haven't actually tried this. This might just screw with physics calculations."

Unity2D,360gmf,snufflupagus,1 point,Fri May 15 05:03:14 2015 UTC,"As an alternative to what _pstudio has said, you could implement your own gravity.  One easy way to do that is just attach a script to your player that, every update, adds a force vector with the strength of your gravity towards the center of the planet.  If you want to keep the rigidbody code that normally handles gravity, you could, you just have to set its gravity value to zero.  If your camera is childed to your player, that could give you the Reus effect."
Unity2D,360gmf,AniMoney,1 point,Sun May 17 18:47:23 2015 UTC,Well my first question is does your game have physics? Because if you're looking for a Mario Galaxy or Angry Birds Space types physics thing that's very different than just orienting a camera and creating a visual effect.

Unity2D,3606od,Mokaii,2,Thu May 14 23:57:45 2015 UTC,The prototype works well. Though depending on what age group you are targeting you may want to add some additional challenge.   My personal preference would be ramping up the pace of the game to a frenzied fast pace may help add difficulty (force a decision within a few seconds and gradually decrease the time for decisions to be made). Especially if you intend on keeping Fight/Run as the only options available. But I love the four second frenzy style games :)
Unity2D,3606od,AdricGod,1 point,Fri May 15 00:36:12 2015 UTC,I am planning to add the option Dialog and to make the game more humorous. Ramping up the difficulty might be a good idea to implement in a newer version.

In OnMouseDown you should probably be raycasting and seeing what you hit, then if it is a box (e.g. has the relevant tag), destroy it.  I think you need to post more of the main script because it's unclear how you go from instantiating objects to referring to one in your OnMouseDown method.  My suspicion is that you're inadvertently destroying all your boxes at once."
Unity2D,35xge3,djgreedo,1 point,Thu May 14 10:15:57 2015 UTC,"So, i hope i understood well, so I made a public gameobject box, and dragged the prefab onto it, so everything goes well, everything instantiates as it should be, but the problem is after i click the 1st cube, after it adds score and destroys it, unity probably doesn't understand what 'box' am i referring to since it was destroyed (?) anyways here's the the main script since i don't really know how to format this, and the spawning script"
Unity2D,35xge3,ThePedanticCynic,1 point,Thu May 14 10:24:51 2015 UTC,"Try the changes below. I'm not sure if I understand exactly what effect you're after, but I think I see where you're going wrong.  The problem is that your main script does not get a reference to 'box' from the spawning script. You create a variable 'box' in the main script but don't put anything in it, so it is null, hence the error you get.  I'm going to suggest a bunch of little fixes that together should get your project working properly, but it involves a bit of fiddling around...  First, create a reference to your spawn script in the main script so you can access its public members. Add this to your main script:  (at the top with your variables)  [SerializeField] SpawningScript spawner;   Save your script, then drag-and-drop the Spawning script from your hierarchy into the Spawner field in the inspector.  Now your main script can access anything in the spawning script via 'spawner'.  In the spawn script:  I would recommend creating a method called 'SpawnBox' that returns a box.  Rename 'void Start' to 'public GameObject SpawnBox', but keep all the code except for the following changes:  a) Remove the for loop, but keep the code inside it (remove the 'for...' line and the opening and closing brackets so the code only runs once). b) at the very end of the method add this line:     return box;  In your main script whenever you want to create a new box you just spawn one by calling the above method (don't type this code in, it's just to illustrate):  GameObject newBox = spawner.SpawnBox();   Back to the main script Replace the 'GameObject box' variable with a list to hold multiple boxes:  List<GameObject> boxes;   You will also need to add the following namespace to your script/class (at the very top):  using System.Collections.Generic;   You need to initialize the list before you can use it, so add this line to the Start() method:  boxes = new List<GameObject>();   In the MouseDown event, cycle through all the boxes to see if you hit one:  void OnMouseDown() {     foreach(var box in boxes)     {         anim.SetTrigger(""Flashed"");         Vector3 difference = this.gameObject.transform.position - box.transform.position;         if (difference.magnitude <= 1.6f)         {             KillBox(box);             score++;         } }   That cycles through the list of boxes and (once we implement it) will destroy any box you've clicked. Instead of calling Destroy directly I will create another method:  void KillBox(GameObject box) {     if(box != null && boxes.Contains(box))     {         boxes.Remove(box);         Destroy(box);         // create a new box here if you want to spawn a new one     } }   Now the clicked box is both destroyed and removed from the list of boxes.  Let's create another method to create a box:  void CreateBox() {      var newBox = spawner.SpawnBox();      boxes.Add(newBox); }   To bring it all together, add the following to your Start() method (make sure it's after the line that initialises the list):  for(int i=0; i<3; i++) {     CreateBox(); }   OK...I didn't intend to write so much...I hope it helps. Bear in mind I didn't test any of this code in Unity and it may need tweaking, but hopefully it illuminates some stuff. I hope I didn't miss anything, and I hope I interpreted what you're trying to do correctly.  I didn't necessarily show you the best way to improve your code, but it's a start. If you plan on expanding this to have lots of boxes (or monsters or spaceships) you should look into object pooling. I've sort of halfway implemented it, but the key is you shouldn't be destroying and instantiating objects during gameplay if you can avoid it (it will cause skipped frames eventually). You really should be creating all objects at the start, then switching them off and on as needed."

Unity2D,35wmco,djgreedo,1 point,Thu May 14 13:23:20 2015 UTC,"Just do the update the same time the value changes. Instead of changing the value directly, use a little method (or a property setter if Unity can do that...not sure).  Something like:  void AddScore(int points) {     score = score + points;     scoreTextBox.Text = score;     MakeFlashingLightsAndSound(); }   Then to update the score:  AddScore(5); // instead of score = score + 5;   I find doing it this way is nice and robust, and is more readable."
Unity2D,35wmco,djgreedo,1 point,Thu May 14 13:39:04 2015 UTC,"Certainly. But that was just an example.  I was thinking, if I have a HUD with a couple dozen values and stuff, that can go up and down when various gameObjects do their thing, what is the best way to ""tie"" a visible value (Text.text) to some property of a gameObject's script.   Perhaps messages, with a listener in a UIHandler script?"
Unity2D,35vjnv,_Nove_,2,Wed May 13 21:33:57 2015 UTC,"Just from reading around, gfx.waitforpresent is really nothing. It is a ""wait"" time. As in your cpu has finished it's processing and it is waiting for other stuff to catch up like the gpu. When you see the wait take 4.55ms like in your image, that means the cpu finished before the gpu and the cpu had to wait that long before it could start working on the next frame. If you disable some of the settings that eat up gpu such as AA and shadows you would likely see this value drop because the gpu isn't holding up the cpu as much."
Unity2D,35vjnv,iamallamaa,1 point,Wed May 13 23:07:08 2015 UTC,My shadows and AA are already disabled :(  could the problem be that most of the sprite that I am using are semi trasparent? ( I am using the standard  sprite' shader)
Unity2D,35vjnv,iamallamaa,2,Thu May 14 06:12:12 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but did you actually disable shadows in the graphics settings? I only ask because it would be easy to assume that just because you are using an unlit shader and not explicitly using shadows that shadows would be disabled but by default they are not. Try lowering the quality settings and see if you have less problems with the spike/slowdowns (edit->project settings->quality). You can even edit a quality level to explicitly turn off stuff like shadows. Check here for more about quality: http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-QualitySettings.html  It is also possible that your isn't the issue at all. Ignore the waitforpresent call (as I said above, it is nothing but the cpu waiting for the gpu to catch up) and look at what would be causing the gpu to spike."
Unity2D,35vjnv,iamallamaa,1 point,Thu May 14 15:18:41 2015 UTC,"Hi thank you for the answers,  yes, the shadows are already disabled even in the graphics setting,  The quality leven is not the problem because the game run at over 1500fps ( with vsync turned off)   on computer, but even with that huge amount of fps I still have spikes caused by gfx.waitforpresent. In the profiler I noticed that when there is a spike in the cpu's profiler there is another one in the Gpu's profiler, this one is caused by a dramicly drop of Camera.Render (from 32% to 1.2%)  here you can see some extra data: http://gyazo.com/310b57b247f66c8c8c23db54d28d2acc http://gyazo.com/d1c0ee16d252135dec819fba7a367d83  ps:in the second picture  you can see that the the gpu need  16ms but in the overview there is nothing that uses such large amount of time"
Unity2D,35vjnv,iamallamaa,2,Thu May 14 18:30:38 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm not sure what would be causing the gpu spike then if the profiler isn't showing it. I did a little searching around and found that directx on windows has a Present function which is likely what ""waitforpresent"" is waiting for. Essentially Present() will take the current graphics buffer and add it to the graphics device for display. What waitforpresent is doing is exactly that, waiting for the Present() function to be called so the cpu can start working on the next buffer.  All the profiler does is record how long a function has taken to run. That function would do nothing but sit in a wait loop doing nothing until after Present() was called. Like I said above, the issue isn't with waitforpresent. That function does absolutely nothing but wait which would mean it is doing nothing while it waits for the Present() function to be called. Of course the profiler will log that it was running for a while (however long it has to wait for Present()), but as it was running, it was really doing no processing except checking if Present() has run so it can continue.  And switching from directx to something else like opengl won't fix the spike. You would likely just not see waitforpresent."

Throw something like this on the objects you only want to move in the Y direction:      private float startPosX;      void Start()     {             startPosX = transform.position.x;     }      void Update()     {             transform.position = new Vector3(startPosX, transform.position.y, transform.position.z)     }   For dealing with only one touch, grab all your information from touch 0, so, say, Input.GetTouch(0).position... but be sure to convert that to world position like so:      Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.GetTouch(0).position);   But what you might want to do to ""move"" the object is use the Touch's delta position, which you can get from:      Input.GetTouch(0).deltaPosition   Edit: As pointed out by /u/PrototypeNM1 you might want to grab the touch information marginally differently if you want to make sure your game doesn't glitch a little bit--depending on how you want it to work. FingerID is a bit more reliable in most situations. I'm personally using GetTouch because I actually want the effect it creates when you let go of one finger."

Then put your movement code within an if(!canMove) statement.  Using the animation events allows you to use it without having to time you animations.
Unity2D,35v9hr,monegames,2,Wed May 13 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"Setting a bool will work, but at some point you're going to have so many if blocks that your code will be a mess. Consider setting up a finite state machine. There's a good tutorial on doing a FSM in Unity here: http://web.archive.org/web/20140702051240/http://unitygems.com/fsm1/  Time.deltaTime just helps you separate movement speed as perceived by the user from frame rate. You can also just execute that code in FixedUpdate(), which goes off at set intervals instead of as fast as possible, as Update() does. I can't think of a way Time.deltaTime specifically helps with stopping movement. That has to come in with an additional multiplier or by not running the code in the first place via control flow, such as using an if statement or FSM."

Unity2D,35wokq,AssembledVS,2,Thu May 14 03:22:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know the definite answer to your question, but there is one thing that may be helpful (or not, if you're already did that). If you're using this method to sort your sprites and sorting order is assigned in Update() without any condition, then you should consider moving the part that handles sorting order change to the function that handles movement (since you need to change the order only when sprite changes its position).  You could test your current script with profiler if you're using Unity 5 to find out how expensive it is. /u/kreaol just created a post with an example of how you could use it to test your code.Link"
Unity2D,35wokq,rearden_serg,2,Thu May 14 08:51:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information. Moving it into the movement function makes sense.  For a top down game with cliffs, etc., I am starting to see drawbacks to this approach. It is becoming obvious to me that this method may work for some parts of the game, but not for others. For example, a sprite's min bounds are used as the screen point, but a sprite with protruding details on the bottom, or a sprite with polygonal collision that should work on the sides as well as the bottom would not work with this method.  I will take a look at /u/kreaol's link. Thanks."

Unity2D,35tug5,shirtface,2,Wed May 13 13:39:30 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but why would you need a special shader for this? Or even why would you assume a shader would help?  You could just have a pie image with each slice individually and layer them to look like a whole pie, removing one image at a time. Make a few different pie slice sizes and that would allow you to generate almost any number of digits by removing multiple slices in some cases (for example, 4 slices could be represented by 8 or 16 slices total that you remove 2 or 4 at a time). It would just be a case of identifying the common multiples up to whatever your maximum number of slices would be."
Unity2D,35tug5,iamallamaa,1 point,Wed May 13 14:22:43 2015 UTC,"I'll be completely honest with you, I have a very limited understanding of the intricacies of shaders and what they are capable of. For one of my earlier projects I found a shader that changed the transparencies of an in game object. I was wondering if it would be possible to extend that and have it shade a custom shape. The math for subdividing the sections would be simple  For the sake of simplicity, all subsections areas are equal and with that logic their angles are all equal.  Find the intersecting pixel in that subsection. The intersection could be calculated if the current vectors angle is between the subsections minimum angle and max angle with this formula  pixel's direction vector = pixel coordinates - center  u = <1,0>  its angle would then be computed as Angle = acos(v dot( u / (magnitude(v))  pixel intersection is true if Angle is between (subsection s -1 * (360/n), subsection s  * (360/n))  Set that pixel's alpha to 0  The reason I don't want to draw is out of laziness. Drawing isn't my strong suit and automating it would probably be easier on the long run."

Unity2D,35tug5,iamallamaa,2,Wed May 13 15:15:42 2015 UTC,Working on every single pixel is exactly how shaders work. Every single pixel is calculated and draws that pixel based on what the shader tells the gpu to draw. A standard sprite shader just looks up the pixel in a texture and draws it. A transparent sprite shader also checks transparency and draws a pixel based on that.  If this is just a flat top down image such as your image above (as opposed to an angled view where you can see filling on the side of a slice) you could likely do something similar to this http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/14770/creating-a-circular-progressbar-timer.html which is made for a circlular timer. It uses a shader to mask an image based on alpha. You might need to update it a little like the images but it should work.

I have several spritesheets all laid out the same covering several different layers and items for each layer. They all use the same animator. Then when someone changes an item on a layer, I get the animator instance off that layer, loop over the the animations, loop over the frames from each animation and update the sprite to point to the new spritesheet and item. This is something that is a pain with Unity's animation system. It can be done, but you end up using LateUpdate and swapping the sprite out every frame with the new sprite simply because you can't edit the base animation."

I think, in part, it wouldn't look half bad if the rotation were restricted to set 10/15/etc degree values versus everything in betweeb 360.0f.

Unity2D,35swwa,shirtface,2,Wed May 13 17:18:27 2015 UTC,"Just a little tip, I have made it a habit to create a new list inside a C# property to take care of instantiation and calling that property instead of the field.

Another word of advice: Keep your child objects generically named. This makes WONDERS when you want to utilize animation clips for different objects.

The following code is the ""magic base formula"" for tight control:      public float moveSpeed;      private Rigidbody2D myRigid;     private Vector2 horizontalMovement;      void Start(){         myRigid = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();     }      void Update(){         horizontalMovement = Input.GetAxisRaw(""Horizontal"");     }      void FixedUpdate(){         myRigid.velocity = new Vector2(horizontalMovement * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTima, myRigid.velocity.y);     }   The idea is that you should ALWAYS start with the simplest piece of code you can, as your game evolves over time and it might be different from what you originally imagined it would be. Get your core mechanics out of the way: Players will decide if they like your game in the first 30-60 seconds anyways. Dealing with things like platforms and slopes are easiest when your code is ultra minimal.  I'll add it to my personal goal list to research and create an as-simple-as-possible slope control setup for the built-in physics though."

Definitely the way to go if you want to able to control the feel of your character's movement. Physics engines are very unpredictable, Box2D is great but not for this type of stuff imo. All the great nintendo platformers that we grew up on didn't use proper physics calculations, they just made the character move with their own methods."

Unity2D,35r1xo,aedalus,2,Tue May 12 22:34:18 2015 UTC,"The ""Touch"" objects for touch screens would be much easier to work with imo. Not sure if there is a better way to do it, but here is what I would probably do:   When it senses a touchphase.begin, create a new List<Touch> For every update frame where touchphase.moved, add the touch to the list When it senses touchpase.ended, you will have a complete list of all the coordinates the player touched.   I don't know how swipe goes about it exactly, but it seems like there are two things that make swipe ""select"" a button rather than pass over it:   A sharp turn Halting on a button for while   We can then go through our list, and try to see where these things occur. Where one does occur, we will add that position to a secondary list.   A sharp turn should result in two touches where the angle between the deltaPosition vectors is greater than some threshold. So if Vector3.Angle(i,i+1) > theta, that was a sharp enough turn. Get the position of the first of the two touches, and store it in our secondary list. Hovering on a spot should mean that the (Magnitude of DeltaPosition)/deltaTime < x. Ideally we would look for at least at least y frames in a row where the value < x, to allow for a bit of error. Add the mean value of all y frames to the secondary list.   The values of theta, x, and y would probably just require a lot of trial and error to get a good feel.  After that we have a list of possible ""hotspots"" that we should be interested in. I imagine there would be some overlap between the above two methods (halting, but then turning sharply), which would result in two very similar hotspots in our list. If the distance between two sequential hotspots is too small, we should delete one of them.  Again, I don't know if there is a better way to go about it, but that would be how I might approach it."

For the rest, I just did a simple google search of like:  ""making clouds inkscape"" ""making treasure chests inkscape""  You find a lot of other tutorials out there. Once you learn the basics (and inkscape, it isn't hard), you can do almost anything from memory easily.

I can't for the life of me figure out what is going on. Is there an issue with how I have it set up? Why only this wall?   EDIT: Found a solution, copied from below:  Found a solution that I don't know if I'm happy with.  I currently have two rays shooting from the side of the character to see if there is a wall (checking if you can walljump). In fixed update I checked if either of these rays have been collided with, if they were then the Player.velocity.x was set to zero.  if (leftWallCheck == true || rightWallCheck == true)  {  PlayerRigidBody.velocity = new Vector2(0f, PlayerRigidBody.velocity.y);  }  This works, but I wonder if there is a better solution."

Secondly I think he mean that instead of basing the flipping on the velocity you should base in on the player's directional input. I agree, one of the things that makes games feel really ""Unity-y"" is the floaty physics and the fact that you keep flying in a direction after you push the opposite way, try manually cutting down your directional physics forces by some large percentage when the player is pushing the opposite way in addition to adding impulse, I can almost garuntee you this will make your game feel more responsive."

Unity2D,35nqha,cadisguy,2,Tue May 12 00:25:28 2015 UTC,"My game uses around 250mb of memory. Is that too much.   Considering that the profiler reads 190mb memory usage from a fresh and un-touched new 2D project, probably not.   This is where a big spike occurs. Usually at the start of the scene. The profiler says it's calling FixedUpdate?   See bold. Do NOT refer to any data at the start of the profiler. Let the game sort of ""load up"" (3-10 seconds depending on computer speed), and then begin your testing and monitoring of the profiler. Of course there will be spikes at the start of a scene: Your game is essentially initializing in it's entirety. This is why we have loading screens in games: It hides all the background caching and slowness that's going on.  Physics updates are performed within FixedUpdate, regardless of whether you use FixedUpdate in any of your scripts or not. Which also means that you should be ONLY using FixedUpdate for physics based movements (velocity, add force, MovePostion, etc). If your physics adjustments are being done in Update(), your users will have varying gameplay experiences if they have slow/fast devices.  Rule of thumb: Update() for Input and FixedUpdate() for physics changes.   So I'm about to release my game soon and want to make it as smooth as possible.

In older versions of Unity Rigidbody2D was cached automatically but in Unity 5 and beyond it is no longer cached so you have to manually get the component yourself.

Unity2D,35mu58,nngafook,2,Mon May 11 20:17:04 2015 UTC,It depends on what your desired effect is. Scaling would likely work fine as long as you are happy with how it looks. It would probably be a little better performance wise and not need the extra space for the images if you used scaling. Scaling however might stretch your sprite a little if done wrong or even pixel rounding where one column/row of pixels is drawn twice. You can control stuff like that by using a spritesheet and just swapping the images.

Unity2D,35mthn,Tortgurt,1 point,Tue May 12 16:44:27 2015 UTC,We just found it simpler to pause the game that way since we already use persistent game managers in our project. Creating your own time vars would work just as well if that's what you're comfortable with.

Unity2D,35ksli,skinwalkerz,5,Mon May 11 08:42:12 2015 UTC,"[note: self-promotion]  I made a Unity asset that does what you want. You basically define your play area as a rectangle, and Resolution Magic will endure that your game camera scales to show the defined area regardless of screen resolution.  Note: designed for 2D only.  https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/24469  A bit more info here, including the full documentation in case you want to see what it does exactly: http://grogansoft.com/wordpress/?page_id=117"
Unity2D,35ksli,djgreedo,1 point,Mon May 11 09:33:01 2015 UTC,So I only have to set the width to 800 and the height 480 and my game will look the same on every android device with resolution 800x480 and everything above that?
Unity2D,35ksli,djgreedo,1 point,Mon May 11 11:18:56 2015 UTC,Yep. You don't even need to think about the actual resolution. Just enclose the core game area inside a canvas rectangle and the enclosed area will fill the screen regardless of the resolution. There are a few more complex options too.  Resolution Magic mainly just zooms the camera to the point where your game takes up as much screen as possible while keeping your defined game area 100% visible. Because Resolution Magic is resolution independent your game would also work on lower resolutions.
Unity2D,35ksli,djgreedo,1 point,Mon May 11 11:46:25 2015 UTC,Does it work on Android as well ? Sorry I am at school right now and I dont have a good internet connection to read the documentation.
Unity2D,35ksli,suppish,1 point,Mon May 11 12:09:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it works on all platforms (it's all done in Unity - there is no platform-specific code).  I have a game on Android using an early version of the asset ('Game of Clowns' - there is a free version you can check out).   Note that because of the way I designed my game the main play screen has 'black bars' if you play it on a non-16:9 screen. This is not an artifact of Resolution Manager - I designed the game for 16:9 and didn't allow for different screen shapes (the game was built for Windows Phone originally, where all screens are 16:9 or 16:10). Try out the game on any Android device(s) you have - it will scale perfectly to fill the screen. The game does nothing to adjust resolution except implement Resolution Magic's scaling prefab.  To avoid black bars you will ideally have a bit of extra 'optional' content around the edges of your game screen that are only visible if the screen is wider (or taller) than your main desired screen shape. If your game suits black bars you can simply let the black bars stay (e.g. if you need to more strongly control what the player sees)."
Unity2D,35ksli,djgreedo,1 point,Mon May 11 12:40:48 2015 UTC,So if the screen of the device is bigger than 800x480( the target resolution) I have to add some extra things on the edges?
Unity2D,35ksli,djgreedo,2,Mon May 11 13:13:59 2015 UTC,The asset made by /u/djgreedo is great and looks something like this on a game targeted for a 10:16 ratio.  9:16  10:16  3:4
Unity2D,35ksli,boxhacker,1 point,Mon May 11 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"No. Resolution Magic ensures that the game area always fills the screen as much as possible regardless of resolution or screen shape.  It doesn't actually matter what resolution you are targeting (in fact you really just target a part of your game scene) - the game will always fill up as much screen as possible with the content area you define.  Imagine watching a widescreen movie on different TVs. It doesn't matter if the TV is HD (hi-res) or SD (low-res) - the movie will fill the screen if it's the same shape. If you watch the same movie on a 4:3 screen it will fill the screen left-right but will leave black bars on the top and bottom because there is no movie content to fill that extra space. If you watch an old 4:3 show on a 16:9 TV you have the same, but the bars are down the sides. But the TV show's content is always fully visible and always as large as the TV allows.  With Resolution Magic you have the added (optional) ability to put content in those black bars areas so your game still fills the screen even on a device that is wider or taller than the screen shape you designed for.  Your game will look the same on an 800x480 as it does on 1600x960 (i.e. double the res) - it will fill the screen on both or any other multiple of 800x480. If your art is high quality it will look sharper on the higher res.  On a 800x600 screen your game would look the same as on 800x480, but with 60px black bars along two edges (e.g. left/right for landscape).  For a game like Street Figher, where the play area is strictly defined (let's say to an 800x480 fighing space), you would make your scene backgrounds a little bit bigger (say 1000x600). On any device that's the same shape as 800x480 your fighting space would simply fill the whole screen. But on a wider device (e.g. 1000x480) your players would see a little extra background on the sides while the fighting area still takes up 800x480.  In any game where your scene is bigger than a static camera view (e.g. any scrolling game) the camera would automatically show extra content if the screen is wider or taller than the screen size you set up.

I aim personally for around a 3:2 aspect ratio, and thus 960x640 will fit that nicely, while allowing a nice quality/size ratio.  The 3:2 aspect ratio was chosen because it can very easily fit to an iPad and the many android devices without loosing too much 'Canvas' space."

Unity2D,35ksli,shirtface,1 point,Mon May 11 18:31:25 2015 UTC,Have you tried the asset yet?  That essentially maintains your 5:3 ratio (which derived from your 800x480 resolution) by scaling the 'Canvas' window to fit the screen device. Then any remaining space left can be used via the 'Background' window. (both a prefab within that asset).  You certainly don't want to be 'cropping' resolutions as you will lose screen estate.

Same applies to moving up, everything else moves in the opposite direction based on its distance factor.

Unity2D,35i5vk,indiecore,1 point,Sun May 10 20:29:10 2015 UTC,Bringing in Google Play never caused me PC build errors as long as I wrapped my code related to it in those if statements.

Unity2D,35j0vp,Kavex,2,Mon May 11 03:38:12 2015 UTC,"Diablo 1 and 2 both use 2D graphics, of course it's possible.  It definitely is not something you should be pursuing for your first project, though."
Unity2D,35j0vp,Okiesmokie,2,Mon May 11 05:55:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, and a number of ways to go about it too!  Using ""classes"" (programming term not the RPG term) you can set up a base class of item/race/class, from there you can set up your different classes/races with the variations on stats, abilities etc that you want.   Items would have a base class which stores the core information about an item (such as the name, the stats the item has, any unique bonus or ability it provides), which is inherited by an item type (axe, hammer, mace, bow etc). When an item ""drops"" (or is spawned) you can set these stats using a semi-random generator (I say semi-random for reasons I go into below).  The item side of things would involve a bit more work, a lot of games utilise an item level approach, this allows you to set an amount of points for distribution of stats (e.g. a low item level might have 10 str and 10 stam on it or 20 total points, whereas a higher item level would have 20str and 20 stam or 40 total points). Once you have a system in place that scales the level of items (and the amount of points that can be allocated) you can then randomise the stats that the item spawns with. Bear in mind that completely random loot can be frustrating (using Diablo 3 as an example, getting str, dex, and int on an item is generally less desirable than a mix of str OR int OR dex AND stam) so you could adopt a prefix/suffix system (like diablo 2 has) whereby you limit the less desirable options that an item can spawn with (WoW used suffixs like 'of the Monkey' to dictate which two main stats were present)."
Unity2D,35j0vp,Beedlez,6,Sun May 10 22:37:37 2015 UTC,"Favour composition over inheritance. I would advice to just have the base classes (so for example Character and Item).  For example, look at Diablo 2 character. A character is basically a set of attributes (strength, dexterity, vitality, energy) and a set of skills l(whirwind, fireball, etcetera). The main differences between classes is attribute gain upon leveling (barbs get a lot of vitality, sorcs a lot of energy) and what skill trees they have access to.  So just have the Character class have these attributes. No need for subclassing. So the Character class might have a List<SkillTree>, which contains the skilltree objects ""Cold Spells"", ""Lightning Spells"" and ""Fire Spells"". This Character is thus a Sorceress. If the Character's skilltree list contained ""Warcries"", ""Combat Masteries"" and ""Combat Skills"", it would be a Barbarian. And so on."

Unity2D,35j0vp,McRawffles,2,Mon May 11 05:18:28 2015 UTC,"Programming experience isn't necessarily the problem. Even knowledge of the engine. It's time based on how complicated the game will be. Even the best programmers and Unity experts can't fight against time.   I consider myself a decent programmer and decent in Unity and I would say a diablo-esque game with some semblance of depth would take several hundreds of hours to program. And that's not even mentioning art, sound, UI, (possible) story.  If you're looking for someplace to start along those lines (after you initially familiarize yourself with the engine) create a simple isometric game, like a tower defense."

Settings seem vary from project to project and in my experience is normally based around the min spec device along with graphical features needed and other technical limitations that may be imposed for various reasons such as binary size, desired frame rate, etc....  With that being said I normally have some sort of quality manager that helps me configure other aspects of this during run time to help me avoid building multiple APKs. This manager is normally looking for objects that implement an interface to allow for fine grained control over separate behaviors or systems all together.  To answer your two questions specifically, I normally release a fat APK. In the past I've had to force OpenGL ES 2.0 but that hasn't been the case for sometime now, ideally I would like this to be auto. Forcing to 3.0 may actually shrink the size of your user base as market share of 3.0 is pretty low with 3.1 being even smaller yet according to the Android Dashboards  I'm sure this isn't the answer you were hoping for but I hope it helps in some manner :)"

Galaxies are the only ones that come to mind. Not sure what it is about them, even when I was doing mobile app development they were a pain.

I apologize for not having a solution, but rather, I am working on a game and nearing the point where I need an inventory system as well, so I wanted to comment to back you up hoping for a good way to go about this, I really hope you get feedback on this topic.   In the meantime however, I wanted to ask, why is the system you described not working as you intend? I have been focusing on achieving crafting through the use of arrays, (use item on another item, checks arrays for compatible items, and then creates new item from array of result items) so I thought what you described would work.   I looked into object pooling and whatnot to keep from instantiating/destroying objects but it seems that if you're only instantiating on room creation and destroying when you pick up an item, that object pooling wouldn't help you much, if any, to just pool one or two objects per room, only to use them again when you happen to need that item (randomly picked). So I wouldn't worry too much about destroying the actual game items. Maybe it would be beneficial to use the pooling on the elements your generate for each room, that you know will be reused over and over (wall elements, etc.)  Anyway, I'm sorry I couldn't help but I wish you the best!"
Unity2D,35fqyq,Coldn,1 point,Sat May 9 23:54:01 2015 UTC,"To elaborate on the 'not working as intended' part:  To start off, I have a Tile Class that stores information about the Tiles, such as the Type of Tile, if there's a character, Item or Trap present. The interesting part for us is the Item, which is a Variable of ItemBase. When I instantiate an item during level creation, I instantiate a prefab that has an ItemXXX component attatched to it, all of which inherit from BaseItem. THAT component is then stored in the Tile itself, rather than the GameObject itself. If I now come across an Item, and walk over it to pick it up, I do the following: The player has an ItemBase[], which is filled with X empty ItemBase elements. I set a temporary itemBase object equal to the Item on the Tile. Loop through my inventory. If the ItemBase[i] is equal to null, and thus not filled yet, that slot is then = to the temporary ItemBase Object and I destroy the Object of the Item that is visualized in the level. Then, I break out of the for-loop. If I then go ahead and pick up another item, it is put into the first slot of the inventory, even though that one is already filled. My first item is being written over.  The funny thing is, I already looked into it somewhat and made a few Debug.Logs, before and after Destroying the Object - And both point to the exact right Component and as such the array should be filled on position [i] even after destroying the Obejcts, whos component is on said position in the array instead of being equal to null. It is still referenced correctly at the end of the method and after the method call in another script. Yet, as soon as I pick up another item - The previously filled index equals null.  The whole thing is giving me a massive headache. I am pretty sure I overengineered something rather simple and that the behaviour it has actually is how it should be code-wise, as the GameObject is destroyed in the method and the temporary object at the method's end, of course. And since my Array is pointing to a pointer is pointing to a (destroyed) object that makes sense, kinda. Plus, I guess explaining this sounds rather.. weird."

It has many useful support methods.  if you need an example I could prolly throw one together.  As for public / private vars, I tend to try to limit what is exposed on an inspector to only the most relevant items, and then make use of debug mode for when you need to monitor values of other vars. Custom getters and setters do have uses for sure, I use a lot of custom setters for updating ui information when the var they are looking at becomes changed."

Y acceleration as a function of x seconds= f''(x) = -25  //Gravity   Y velocity after x seconds = f'(x) = -25x + C  //Integral of acceleration = velocity   As start velocity after the dash is supposed to finish = 0:   f'(0) = 0  => f'(x) = -25x   Height x seconds after descent:  f(x) = -25x^2 + C   Assuming startheight is y:  f(0) = y => f(x) = -25x^2 + y   Quick algebra to determine how long it takes for the player to fall to standard ground at y = a:  y-25x^2 = a  x^2 = (y-a)/25  x = sqrt((y-a)/25) -> x is always the positive solution as you can't go back in time (sadly)   Now when you have a value for how long it takes for him to fall, you can calculate how far along the x-axis he would travel during this time so you can accuractely determine where he lands (and prevent him from hitting something there):  f'(x) = 10            //Units per second   f(x) = 10x           //The C constant is irrelevant as we are looking for deltaX   Number of units ahead of currentposition by the time it takes for him to land:  f(sqrt((y-a)/25)) = 10 * sqrt((y-a)/25)   And now finally, the action raycasting:  RaycastHit2D ray = Physics2D.Raycast(new Vector2(transform.position.x + 10 * sqrt((y-a)/25), transform.position.y), new Vector2(0,-1,0), *arbitary length to make sure you hit*, obstacleMask);' if (ray.collider != null)      .....

Unity2D,35dx7p,Storyboar,1 point,Sat May 9 19:23:56 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks for the detailed reply! I really appreciate it.   I tried implementing it and it's not completely accurate, but I'm not sure if it's a mistake on my end or with the function. But I still found a way to use it!  So for   10 * sqrt((y-a)/25)       my Y is my player's transform.position.y (or more specifically, the bottom of his collider) right? and a is my ground's y transform (or top of it's collider)? Just checking because I wasn't totally sure if that's what I was supposed to put in.  Well, with those numbers being plugged in, it went too far out in the X-plane before raycasting down, but not waaay off or anything. I decided it was good enough since I want to make sure the player has a bit of buffer space in front of him when landing so he can jump before running into something.  An improvement I made was to use a for loop to make multiple raycasts, from the player's position straight down out to where the function determine's he'll land, that way I know that the whole area in between is safe. Otherwise it might be safe where he was going to land, but not somewhere in between his current location and there, and he'd run into something and die before getting there. The for loop might be a little intensive, but my game isn't that heavy otherwise so it's okay I think.  Here's what the while loop looks like now:  // is it safe to land? bool safeToLand = false;  while (!safeToLand) {     // set dash state     characterState = ""dashing"";      float playerY = transform.position.y + _distBetweenTransformAndColBottom;     float groundY = 1.9f;     float distanceToGround = playerY - groundY;     float distanceTraveledX = runSpeed * Mathf.Sqrt( (playerY-groundY)/(Mathf.Abs(gravity)) );     int numRays = 4;      // raycast multiple rays in increments from player's X location to where he'll land     for (int i = 0; i <= numRays; i++)     {         float multiplier = (float) i/numRays;         //Debug.Log(""multiplier: "" + multiplier);          Vector2 origin = new Vector2( (transform.position.x) + distanceTraveledX*multiplier, transform.position.y);         Vector2 direction = new Vector2(0, 1)*-distanceToGround;          RaycastHit2D ray = Physics2D.Raycast(             origin,             direction             //*arbitary length to make sure you hit*, obstacleMask)             );          if (Debug.isDebugBuild)             Debug.DrawRay( origin, direction, Color.green);          // if our ray collided with something         if (ray.collider != null)         {             // if it hit the floor             if (ray.transform.gameObject.layer == LayerMask.NameToLayer(""Floor""))             {                 // is this the final ray (have they all hit the floor?)                 if (i == numRays)                 {                     if (Debug.isDebugBuild)                     {                         for (int j = 0; j <= numRays; j++)                         {                             float multiplier2 = (float) j/numRays;                             Debug.DrawRay( new Vector2(transform.position.x + distanceTraveledX*multiplier2, origin.y), direction, Color.green, 2f);                         }                         Debug.Log(""Safe to land"");                     }                     // we can land now                     safeToLand = true;                 }                 else                 {                     // this isn't the final ray, so we need to keep checking and make sure the next ray is ok                     continue;                 }             }             else             {                 // it didn't hit the floor                 break;             }         }         else         {             // our ray didn't collide with anything             break;         }     }      if (!safeToLand)     {         yield return null;     }   Anyways, I did some testing with different jump heights, and using the incremented rays (the multiplier) I noticed he always landed in the same spot, between the 3rd and 4th ray, or between .5 and .75 of  distanceTraveledX = runSpeed * Mathf.Sqrt( (playerY-groundY)/(Mathf.Abs(gravity)) ). I'm not sure exactly, it might be 0.667, might be 0.7 of the way. Maybe there's something the function doesn't account for that I/you missed? Either way I don't mind because I wanted that buffer space anyways. But if you figure it out I'd love to know so feel free to post or PM me.  Thanks a ton man, math is fun."
Unity2D,35dx7p,Storyboar,2,Sun May 10 06:49:26 2015 UTC,"Edit: The pictures are extremely small, if using RES you can click-drag them to increase the size...   my Y is my player's transform.position.y (or more specifically, the bottom of his collider) right? and a is my ground's y transform (or top of it's collider)? Just checking because I wasn't totally sure if that's what I was supposed to put in.   This depends on the pivot point of the player & ground. Allow me to paint using my magical paint skills a picture.   P = Playerobject   G = Groundobject  Their squares = their colliders  Each ray's startposition equals the objects actual position. However, where this is relative to the collider depends on the pivot point of the sprite rendered by the spriterenderer.  The blue ray starts at pivot point = top, red at pivot point = center and green at pivot point = bottom.  If your pivot point was set to center x then I might have an idea as to what caused the ray to shoot a bit further than wanted:   New picture  Green is the distance traveled during the descent, cyan is the raycast sent down at that position, red is the player object should he be at the raycast position.  As you can see from the cyan ray, it hits neither blue obstacle even though the actual red playerobject will collider with both of them in reality. It does hit the yellow one, however.  Perhaps a more complete solution would involve making 3 or more raycasts close to eachother at the descent point; one is at the start of the player's collider (currentRayPoint.x - collider2d.bounds.extents.x), the other is at the center (currentRayPoint.x), and the last one is at the end of the collider (currentRayPoint.x + collider2d.bounds.extents.x)  And yes, I know you can't actually pull the extents without reference anymore but I cba write it out."
Unity2D,35dx7p,Storyboar,1 point,Sun May 10 09:30:11 2015 UTC,"Ok I got it working! I made sure to raycast from the right points but that wasn't the problem anyways.

Unity2D,35ciyh,brutang,3,Sat May 9 05:23:21 2015 UTC,"I had a gradient for the water at the surface as it quickly changes, but a little below, I have a water image that follows my camera. The sprites use the shader sprite-diffuse, and the deeper I go, the lower the intensity the directional light becomes. When you get deep enough, the intensity eventually becomes zero, so the contrast of the lighting and the darkness starts looking pretty neat.  Edit: I have a directional light that lights everything which dims the lower you go, and a light attached to Scuba Bot, the intensity on Scuba Bot doesn't change except from going from 0 (surface) to full power a few meters deep."

I just learned about this pattern a few weeks ago, so I thought this would be a good chance to put it into practice.  I know its a bit overkill for this small of a project, but I like testing new ways of doing things.  I actually like the MCV pattern because changing how one thing works doesn't mess up the rest.

Unity2D,35blmu,DeWitcher,1 point,Tue May 12 14:15:01 2015 UTC,"I very quickly bastardized some code from a Unity Physics player controller I'm working on (my first original script in Unity).  I've uploaded a web build to gamebucket.  The whole project is available on github (also a first, for me).  The first main script, BallMover.cs, gives the player control of the horizontal velocity of the ball. It directly alters the velocity of the Rigidbody2D using Mathf.Lerp with a float t that changes. The change in float t allows the player to decelerate faster than he/she accelerates. When no input is provided and current velocity is below 1, the ball will quickly come to a stop (using Mathf.MoveTowards).  The second script, BallVerticalState.cs, uses a sloppy, rudimentary state machine (enum, switch statement, transition functions and statecheck functions). The state machine layer provides valuable control and monitoring of the object's response to input and the physical environment. The height of the jump is directly controlled by how long the space bar is pressed. If you look at ApplyJumpForce (), you can see how I tried to minimize the ""Jetpack Effect"". Ground detection is handled with OnCollisionStay2D and OnCollisionExit2D. Parts of this are hardcoded and can be greatly improved. Friction is removed from the player character while jumping upward. The method I used for doing this is ""hacky"", but it works.  The scripts are separated for no reason. It was just easier for me to copy/paste snippets into them this way.  The state machine may seem excessive for this scenario, but I'm developing this project for a dynamic physical environment and having more control and feedback has really helped with debugging. It will also help with adding sounds/animations and any future additions have a basic template to follow.  Cons:   These scripts have only been tested using a circlecollider2d for the player character. Parts are hardcoded, parts need refactoring, the scripts are unnecessary split. The player character will slow down if it is exceeding maximum velocity and the player presses either directional input key. There is currently no way to reduce changes in velocity while the player is in the air. I whipped this together this morning and there are no comments in the scripts. Sorry. Edit: Added some comments There's a collision bug in the web build that doesn't exist in the editor. Edit: fixed.   Any feedback is greatly appreciated!"

It only shows that you know what you are doing (or at least know how to Google, incalculably more valuable then knowing advanced mathematics and programming), AS WELL AS you know how to follow directions, provide what was requested, and not feature-creep.   Who owns the project after you hand it to them for review?   OP didn't mention if they had to give up the source, but if a company asked me to do a simple game for them I personally WOULD ask for a quick contract that explains ownership and stuff.

I'm pretty sure they do, especially if it involved you using assets/code provided and some sort of NDA signed. For this, it was pretty open ended though and free to do whatever you wanted as long as it resembled the genre in some way. I'm not really going to look into it though since I don't intend to use it for anything, too many other projects going on right now haha."

Some places just do it as a matter of procedure, especially if they're hiring recent graduates.  It's supposed to be a generic request that demonstrates the skills they need, like the one OP was asked to do. As far as I know, you own the project, they can't take it from you and use it since you don't work for them yet. I mean, they can but that is stealing.  When they start asking you to do something really specific that you know they'll try to take for free and use in their own project, then it's time to run for the hills, because they're not trying to hire you anyway - at least in my experience."

I did purchase the Iso builder plugin that was on the madness sale and although it did handle tile placement really well, the way they handle character movement was too different from how I did it to make the effort to change it. Especially since I was very tight on time.  So no, I didn't use plugins.  What helps a lot though is using the snapping feature in unity. So for me, my tiles were x:64 and y:32. Type that into the snapping window and hold control (PC) when you move the gameobject in the scene to let it snap properly. It saved me a lot of eyeballing haha."

So you would have interfaces like :   IActorPhysics - Interface for classes which can recieve input and move stuff IDamageable - Interface for classes that can take damage IExplodable - Interface for classes that can explode   And classes like:   PlayerInput - relies on there being an IActorPhysics present, responsible for receiving input PlayerMovement - implements IActorPhysics and IDamageable, moves player with regular platformer physics (walk, run, jump, etc) CarMovement - implements IActorPhysics, IDamageable, and IExplodable, moves player with car physics (accelerate, brake, etc) PlaneMovement - implements IActorPhysics, IDamageable, and IExplodable, moves player with plane physics (accelerate, pilot up/down, etc) PlayerState - manages what state the player is (on foot, car, plane, etc), takes the input from PlayerInput and tells it which movement script to use, makes sure the player can leave the vehicle,  makes sure the player's sprite and the vehicle's move together, etc   I got the idea from Unity's Good Coding Practices article"

Ultimately this is the communities subreddit, not mine, and thinking about it I've decided that it's actually quite rude that I sometimes insta-reply to new threads.   What. No it's not lol.   There is a large benefit to assisting others: If you've ever skipped a thread/question because you thought I might reply to it or don't have the answer off the top of your head, sometimes just giving a thought is plenty to a struggling dev, even if it's just to tell them to take a walk outside.   This seems misguided, I don't think anyone is thinking ""oh I don't need to reply to this thread because /u/kreaol will take care of it.""

Unity2D,359ybm,Rouxmire,5,Fri May 8 23:12:40 2015 UTC,"Here's my recommended process for the ultra-beginner:   Pick up a good ""Learn Visual C#"" type book, and make sure to check reviews first. Then one I have is called ""Visual C# 2012 - Step by Step"". If you pick up that particular book, I'd say to go up to Chapter 6 initially, and only THEN step into Unity. Read the other chapters in your spare time. Understanding things like syntax, loops and comparisons, etc are essential things: The rest of the chapters are important as well, but you can do very well with just the ""basics"". With C# basics under your belt, the land of Tutorials is both vast and diverse. Some like slow ""real-time"" tutorials, others like fast-paced scripted tutorials. There are some options in the sidebar, as others have mentioned. There is no ""best"" as much as my personal recommendation is to avoid any tutorial with bad video/audio: You're brain will just hurt. Don't live in the land of Tutorials for a long time. You can have 100+ hours of tutorials under your belt, load up a new project, and still be lost as to where to ""Start"". No amount of tutorials will ever be able to teach you how to ""Start"" a game. Ultimately all tutorials are simply teaching you THEIR way to do things: It will be hard at first, but learning how to find things on your own and knowing WHEN to ask questions is ultimately better then any best practice and/or tutorial.   edit  Slightly adding to the last point: I still use tutorials, but unless I really like a certain series, I mainly use them to see how a particular effect is done, skipping through as needed."

Unity2D,3536y2,one_sociopath,1 point,Wed May 6 18:50:03 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you're doing some sort of Y coordinate based sorting?  If so, what you could try is instead of having a Y of 5 equal a sorting order of -5, have it equal a sorting order of -50 (the sorting is negative because higher objects should be behind lower objects).   Now for your player's body parts. If the player is at Y3 (sorting -30), his body parts can be on -30, -31, -32, etc. Also, instead of basing his body parts off of their own Y coords, they would be based off of the player's root position then with their own offset applied. Because your sorting is scaled by 10, you now have the ability to have objects with 10 separate sorting layers appear in front of something 1 unit higher.   There is a max sorting order of 32767 (or -32767), so running out of sorting orders shouldn't be a problem. If for some reason you do need more than this, you could even have objects further separated by sorting layer, with one sorting layer covering 1,000 game units.

If you know basic stuff like variables and functions then you know 90% of what you need to know to start using C# in Unity.  If you just want to do Unity stuff just look through Unity's Documentation. The vast majority of what you know is there.
Unity2D,3514lk,Randommook,2,Wed May 6 07:55:40 2015 UTC,"I just wanna know how to use Unity's code, which is apparently C#. I know nothing about it, I've only ever used HTML or python in the past."
Unity2D,3514lk,orlyyarlynowai,1 point,Wed May 6 09:01:18 2015 UTC,Well in that case most of what you need to learn isn't the particular use of C# but rather the quirks of Unity and how to use it. If you know Python then it won't be that big of a leap to change to C#.  Your biggest problem is that there really isn't a good way to make a tutorial for Unity that doesn't involve using a video. There is a lot more to making a game than just strictly coding. For example setting up Animations is going to be tricky to explain without a video.  If you just want to wing it my best advice would be to find someone who has posted their code on this subreddit and look through it to figure out how they put stuff together. If they use a term you don't understand then google that term + Unity and you should find Unity's documentation on the subject.

Check out the table in this page: http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html  Though, I've heard there are a few cases that are different for 2D.   Is it a good idea to mix raycasts and rigidbodies? Or should all collision be strictly done with one or the other? I'm asking mainly because I always read the two being compared, but never working together.   They are very different tools, but not exclusive at all. General collision should almost always be done with rigibodies and colliders. Raycasting is typically for finding out some bit of specific information. Is there an open line of sight between these two points? How far is my character from the ground? That sort of thing."

Unity2D,3523nt,AdricGod,3,Wed May 6 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"Both /u/sasstag and /u/NickJVaccaro point out the issue that your if-statements aren't executing the logic that you want.  Another issue, unfortunately, may be that you are both applying forces to the rigidbody, and manually moving its transform with this line:  transform.position += new Vector3(x, y, 0).normalized * Time.deltaTime * speed;   Generally, you want to avoid directly modifying the transform of an object that is affected by physics, because it will cause the physics system to behave unexpectedly; you may miss collisions, etc.   The 2 approaches are generally:   Use physics for all movements. Instead of modifying the transform directly when walking either: apply a force, set the rigidbody's velocity, or use Rigidbody.movePosition Dont use physics at all. Modify transform.position as you're doing. If you need collision detection, you can use Raycasts and colliders to detect when things (are about to) collide, but you have to do the collision response yourself.   The choice really depends on what type of game you're making."
Unity2D,3523nt,nostyleguy,1 point,Wed May 6 14:47:18 2015 UTC,"First I want to apologize for not being able to test this out as I'm not at my dev computer, but the following stood out to me:   It looks like GetAxisRaw returns a value of -1, 0, or 1 for keyboard input.  So I believe instead of comparing your x and y around 1, you may want to compare whether they are greater than 0 or less than 0 (not equal). I noticed that you are applying a negative force if y <= 1, but a positive Force if x <= 1.  Is this intentional?   What I think is happening is that no matter where you are moving, x is going to either be -1, 0, or 1.  If it is 1, the third if statement will run, resulting in Vector2(Force, y) being applied.  If it is 0 or -1, the fourth statement will run, also resulting in Vector2(Force, y) being applied.  So I would revisit the logic a bit.  Hopefully this helped! If you need any clarification I can try to help further."
Unity2D,3523nt,NickJVaccaro,1 point,Wed May 6 14:05:27 2015 UTC,"I would guess that your moving-left issue is likely caused by your last if-statement which is missing a (-) in front of the Force value in the Vector2 declaration.  Also, you can clean up/fix your force addition cases by changing all of the if-statements adding your force to:  rb2d.AddForce(new Vector2(x, y).normalized * Force);   This would not just simplify your code, but it would actually make sure that the force is directly behind your character (without having your if-statements add an additional x or y value to the force vector when your player moves diagonally, for example) and get rid of overlapping/cancelling cases for example when either of the Horizontal or Vertical axes are 1 at the same time.  Another note to make, generally with rigidbodies and physics, you want to put any code that deals with updating physics (applying forces in this case) within FixedUpdate since it allows the calculations to be consistent no matter the framerate."
Unity2D,3523nt,sasstag,1 point,Wed May 6 14:17:32 2015 UTC,You have '-Force' for one of the y value conditions.    For x you just use 'Force' on both.  I assume for one of the x directions you want '-Force'?
Unity2D,3523nt,clarkster,1 point,Wed May 6 19:12:10 2015 UTC,"This isn't directly related to your issue, but it should help you none the less.  You should never call AddForce in Update, it should always be done in FixedUpdate. This is because movement can become jittery if physics are applied at an inconsistent timestep (Update is called a variable amount of times per second, whereas FixedUpdate is consistent).  You will still need to get your input in Update however, so make your x and y movement variables private class variables, and add a bool that saves GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space). You can then reference those variables from the FixedUpdate function.  This isn't too big of an issue for you yet though, because you're only applying the force from pressing space one time. Once you start dealing with continuous forces though, this will be necessary.  /u/nostyleguy's comment is also really good advice"

You will hear a lot of conflicting opinions regarding this, but this is the general consensus.  It isn't set in stone of course though. For instance in my game, I don't use Unity's physics system. Because I handle all my own movement and collision calculations, I put it all in Update. Mine is a special case though."

Unity2D,351bpc,Harabeck,1 point,Wed May 6 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"To get a 1 to 1 drag, put this in the Update() of a script with a reference to the camera in camTrans. By putting all positions in world space, the dragging is independent of orthographic camera size, so if you zoom that way (which I do), it still works no matter how far in or out you're zoomed.  if (Input.GetButton(""Fire2""))//or whatever button you want {     Vector3 dragPanning = mousePos.FromMainScreenToWorld() - Input.mousePosition.FromMainScreenToWorld();     camTrans.position += dragPanning;  } mousePos = Input.mousePosition;   FromMainScreenToWorld() is an extension method:  public static Vector3 FromMainScreenToWorld(this Vector3 v) {     return Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(v); }   Define it in your own project somewhere or just call ScreenToWorldPoint directly.  edit: oops, had a statement in the wrong place"

Unity2D,351bpc,Coldn,1 point,Wed May 6 19:32:32 2015 UTC,"Hi, I don't know if this would be any help at all or if you would want this but I thought I'd offer anyway.  A while back for my top down game I was looking for a way to handle moving the camera with the mouse, and came across smooth mouse look, which simply rotated the camera towards the mouse. I wanted something similar but for the camera to stay exactly orthogonal and facing down, panning rather than looking. I wrote a script to do that, and I'm happy with it. I included zooming but since I use tk2D, it's tailored for their camera which should be an easy fix.   The good thing about is you don't have to drag, it sets a distance away from a world point that is its maximum travel distance and averages the distance between your mouse point and that origin point, so you can keep that point on screen if you want while still allowing panning.   If you want the script to try out or anything just let me know, hope you find what you're looking for!"
Unity2D,350npb,Dparse,2,Wed May 6 03:04:42 2015 UTC,"Answer to question 1:  Use the Initiate method to create new objects in the game world, and use a Prefab to do away with the work of things like attaching the correct scripts/Rigidbodies/whatever.  Set variables as public in the Prefab's script, and just naturally modify them.  In my case, I should set the parent of the cell as the grid that made it so that I can move the grid and have it move the cell.  My new GridManager.js:  #pragma strict  // these variables are not currently used, they will be important for me later var grid_width : int = 7; var grid_height : int = 7; var cell_width : int = 16; var cell_height : int = 16; var cell_gap_x  : int = 5; var cell_gap_y  : int = 5;  public var cell_prefab : Transform;  function Start () {    Debug.Log(""Beginning to instantiate""); // Beginning to instantiate    var cell = Instantiate(cell_prefab, Vector3(1,2,3), Quaternion.identity);    cell.transform.parent = transform;    Debug.Log(""After instantiate: "" + cell); // After instantiate: Cell(Clone) (UnityEngine.Transform)    cell.GetComponent.<Cell>().width = 20;   cell.GetComponent.<Cell>().height = 20;    Debug.Log(""Cell width, height: "" + cell.GetComponent.<Cell>().width + "", "" + cell.GetComponent.<Cell>().height);   // Cell width, height: 20, 20  }  function Update () {  }   I made an Empty Game Object called Cell and added a script component, then made an empty Prefab in my assets and dragged Cell onto it. I then set the prefab's script to be Cell.js, and set GridManager's transform variable to be the Prefab. I then deleted the initial ""Cell"" object.  When the game starts, an object called Cell (Clone) is created at 1,2,3 and you can see in the heirarchy that it is a child of GridManager. The Prefab for the cell is default width and height = 16, but the object created at game start has width and height = 20 like I dictate in my script.  Cell.js has nothing important in it except for:  public var width : int; public var height : int;   Issue: Moving the parent grid does not move the cell, looking into solution with transform.localPosition"

You'd just set the offset with something like:    cell.GetComponent<Cell>().xOffset = transform.position.x - cell.position.x;   cell.GetComponent<Cell>().yOffset = transform.position.y - cell.position.y;   Right after you set the width and height."

If you're lazy like me: Probaby just make a red square in photoshop and then turn it into a prefab and then instantiate it where you want. If all your ""cell"" objects are the same size you can just make one red square that will fit them and instantiate it where you want. If they are different sizes you'll have to alter the dimensions of the prefab to make it fit.  Option #2: You can use Debug.DrawLine to make some red lines to create your square. These won't be visible ingame (only visible in the editor) though as they are debug lines. If you want them to be visible ingame you can use a LineRenderer instead."

If I were making Pong, I would look at the ball's Y position, and then move my AI paddle to the same position.  You could vary the ""strength"" of the AI by comparing the Ball Y position and the Paddle Y Position, and then add a percentage of the difference to the Paddle Y Position.  i.e. If the difference between Ball and Paddle is 100 pixels, then you can say ""a strong AI will now add 100 pixels to the paddle Y position"" - or ""a weak AI will now add only 50 pixels to the paddle Y position"".

There is just a slight learning curve to using WebGL and not as many resources (yet) to explain it that much. For instance, you can set the amount of memory for your game in WebGL: too little and the game won't have enough to run, but too much and the browser won't be able to load it up. Once we get more resources/tutorials out there on WebGL it will be better, but right now I think the community is still learning as a whole as to what works best."

Sure I just have to tap to start a new round, then hit back, but this is slightly annoying I like all the visuals, except the planet in the background. It looks too similar in color to the asteroids; sometimes I think its an obstacle.  As a gamedev, I like the monetization of watching a video for a shield, but as a gamer, i can't help but assume that some people are just watching dozens of videos to get the highest scores. It makes me want to compete less. Maybe adding a cap of 1 (or 3? or 5) shields per run would alleviate this.

A way I personally managed those cases is to quickly press jump twice (a unknown bug/feature :P) to quickly go down again, tap the right number, and jump again. the pause menu is something that got in pretty last moment and didn't get as much love. I'll do some more work on that, thanks. Maybe I'll make it a bit darker/lower contrast, so it seems further in the background, see if that'll help.

If this is a singleplayer game and the player really wants to mod a character into the game, then they can probably go ahead as long as you have made your game resources accessible.

Unity2D,34vg3m,suppish,1 point,Mon May 4 22:42:55 2015 UTC,"Short answer : Possible? Yes.  Long answer, You would need them to give you the file, have a script that shows an Open file dialog box, ability to get what they give you, copy it into the resource folder, Change the sprite of the object you are using for the character, Sync image over network (if its a networked game).  That's just for the picture. For custom animations, depending on how you have your character set up, is harder, if you are using a part sheet (each part of the body is separated) then its a tad easier, just save the time states into an xml file or something, but if its a single sprite per state of animation, Then you have more work here."

Unity2D,34vho9,Doom_Unicorn,1 point,Tue May 5 14:37:19 2015 UTC,"The most straightforward answer: I'd suggest you make a game object for each different block (one for each sprite), and then save those as prefabs. There's no real reason to try to have a single game object that changes sprites, unless you're using an animation controller of course. In the script that is controlling the instantiation behavior, have a public variable that is an array of GameObjects. Drag and drop the prefabs to populate that array, and manipulate it in script as needed (using random to generate an index and then take the object from the array that fits that index). The latest tutorial project from Unity (the 2D Roguelike) has exactly what you need in its lessons.  Expanding on the answer: I'd use object pooling instead of instantiation, though that's irrelevant to the core of your question. You can google Unity + Object Pooling for some good resources and tutorials on that."

There is not only a transition going TO JobBack, but a transition from JogBack back to Idle as well. Essentially you just need to ensure there is a transition back to Idle: Don't rely on ""Any State"".  The parameters of the transition is solely dependent on your animation/art style. If there is no blending of animations between the states (ie; you are doing sprite-frame based animation), you would have ""Has Exit Time"" checked ON for the return transition, setting the Exit Time value to ""1.0"" and the transition time to ""0.0"".

The only thing I would change is to not declare an array of sprites, since that will make you depend on an array order just to know which sprite to use. Just declare a public sprite for each animation state you want:  public Sprite idleSprite; public Sprite reactionSprite; // Set these in the inspector.  private SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer;  void Awake(){     spriteRenderer = GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>(); }  void Update(){     if( transition-to-reacting-conditional ){         spriteRenderer.sprite = reactionSprite;     }     if( transition-to-idle-conditional ) {        spriteRenderer.sprite = idleSprite;     } }   If you combine all the sprites into 1 spritesheet, you'll want to import them as a 'multiple' type sprite, and Unity will cut them into separate individual sprites, which you can use in this script. This will save draw-calls vs individual images, which is the main reason spritesheets are a thing. Best of both worlds."

You can then share the same animator controller between all the objects so that you can make the same exact calls to initiate and start/stop the animation.

You could actually make it fly in circles like that by adjusting rotation angle a little and then use transform.up to move forward. ""up"" will take into account your rotation. IMO the easier method would be to fake it by adjusting the pivot point to the side of the item and then adjust rotation to move in a circle while moving along a single axis.

Regardless, what you're really doing is just checking the various states of the character and doing the animation or displaying the appropriate sprite.  You can also save a lot of time by simply inverting the scale of an object along the X axis to make the character look flipped.

So you would have shield in layer 1, character in layer 2 and sword in layer 3. Then when you flip the layers you can flip the layer order (sword in 1, character in 2 and shield in 3) this will make it seem like the character has actually turned and not just flipped."

If you're dead set on using 2 separate animations for right and left you might want to try animating your character's body in separate pieces to minimize the amount of work you have to do but it might come out looking awkward if you don't do it very carefully.

For crisp pixels you need to: 1.) use point filtering 2.) turn off mip maps 3.) set Max Size to largest number available, then back it off until right before it goes wonky--experiment and you'll find the sweet spot. 4.) set Format to True Color.  At that point your sprites should be crisp in-game and in-editor.  If the sprites look good but the size of the pixels doesn't seem uniform, then you need to look at orthographic camera settings.  Hope this helps!"

Unity2D,34mstr,jamiejefferson,5,Sat May 2 19:58:50 2015 UTC,"Camera.main.orthographicSize = Screen.height / (2f * 64);  The reason I'm using 64 is that 32 makes the game far too zoomed out and everything is way too small.   The correct formula is:   Camera.main.orthographicSize =  (Screen.height / unitsPerPixel) / 2f);   You cannot get around this. It's not a Unity limitation: It's a hardware limitation. You cannot force 0.5f or 1.5f of pixel into a single pixel. You HAVE to set the orthographic size of the camera to the correct amount to achieve true pixel perfect presentation.  For texture size, the rule of thumb is that max size has to be equal to or greater then the largest value between the entire textures height / width. So if your texture/spritesheet is 1024x1024, you would set max size to 1024. If it's 512x4096, you need to set max size to 4096."
Unity2D,34mstr,kreaol,1 point,Sat May 2 22:27:32 2015 UTC,"Using the above formula does seem to make everything pixel perfect, but everything is very zoomed out. How would I get around this? Just make increase the pixels per unit value of the sprites I import?"
Unity2D,34mstr,jamiejefferson,1 point,Sat May 2 23:24:41 2015 UTC,"Increasing the pixels per unit won't do anything, since the formula will just recalculate the camera size again.  If you want to have less pixels shown (ie; not have it zoomed out), just limit the resolution itself. You can define the allowed resolutions within the Quality Settings of your project. So 1280x720 will appear less ""zoomed out"" when compared with 1920x1080, as pixel perfect requires physical pixels on the screen and there are literally less pixels to display with 720p.  You can see this easily in Terraria in window mode: clicking and dragging the window larger doesn't actually effect the shown sizes of anything, but everything appears to have ""zoomed out"" because there is literally more pixels to show."
Unity2D,34mstr,kreaol,1 point,Sun May 3 01:01:35 2015 UTC,"To have the right amount shown, the resolution needs to be 640x360. I set this using:  Screen.SetResolution (640, 360, true);  I also set this in the Edit > Project Settings > Player, so the default width and height is 640x360.  The trouble is it now looks really blurry when I play it fullscreen. I expected it to scale and still look just as crisp, have I done something wrong to cause this?  EDIT: The change of res via code was causing the fuzziness. Removing that made it nice and crisp. What I've done is used:   Camera.main.orthographicSize =  Screen.height / 128f / 2f;   This has given me the right ""zoom"" level and also keeps things pixel perfect. However, at different resolutions, the camera shows more (higher) or less (lower) which I wanted to avoid, is that possible?"
Unity2D,34mstr,snuggly_sasquatch,1 point,Sun May 3 18:35:00 2015 UTC,"You can scale the pixel size at integer values (so one pixel of your original art takes 1x1, 2x2 or 3x3 etc screen pixels) with this modification  Camera.main.orthographicSize =  (Screen.height / unitsPerPixel) / 2f / pixelScale; // pixelScale must be an integer   If that scaling is ""too much"" then you'll need to modify your art assets to the size you want."
Unity2D,34mstr,snuggly_sasquatch,2,Sun May 3 08:58:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really recommend this method, because ultimately you are just mimicking a lower resolution. It'd be simpler to just lower the actual resolution of the game."
Unity2D,34mstr,snuggly_sasquatch,2,Sun May 3 14:25:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe I misunderstand, but it sounds like your suggestion is just ""prevent the game running at any resolution other than the intended one""?  Let's say I have a game that's 1:1 pixel perfect at 320x180. This is obviously too tiny to run in a window or web player, and most likely doesn't have monitor support as a fullscreen resolution. It would need to be scaled up to 1280x720, 1920x1080 etc. Ideally it could even be an unrestricted resizable window (like Terraria, but with scale increases at particular window heights). I could just do a quick switch on Screen.height to determine what pixel scales to use, and I could have a game that works at all resolutions and maintains a pixel perfect ratio.  How do I do this without applying a pixel scale to the camera?"
Unity2D,34mstr,snuggly_sasquatch,2,Sun May 3 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"Your method would be the correct one in that case: Limiting the pixel amount would be the ideal if you wanted true pixel perfectness, but ultimately the only other method would be to go with doubling/tripling/etc up the camera. My only concern with that: wouldn't sprites then potentially bleed into other pixels when a half pixel occurs?"
Unity2D,34mstr,DaveCarlile,2,Sun May 3 19:53:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not in front of my computer right now, but as I remember it, the height of your sprite (or is it the pixels per unit?) needs to divide evenly into the height of the camera, so that unity doesn't have to stretch or squish your sprites when tendering--if it does, it will cause subpixel rendering, and the pixel sizes won't look right, and things can get fuzzy.

Unity2D,34mq4s,scandinavian-,2,Sat May 2 15:48:04 2015 UTC,generally you get issues like this when you have a whole bunch of box colliders right next to eachother. You could just stretch one big box collider over flat sections of ground rather than having a bunch of individual boxes for your character to get stuck on or pushed around by.  Otherwise if you really want to stick with individual box colliders then you have to make sure that the individual boxes are lined up perfectly. So the best way I've found to do this is to use the vertex placement tool to line the boxes up perfectly (Hold down V).  You can also use a tool (Like the one in this video) to generate the colliders for you automatically if you use a tile based level system.
Unity2D,34mq4s,Randommook,1 point,Sun May 3 00:47:47 2015 UTC,Search ghost vertices. Either round the edges of your player collider or don't use a ton of box-colliders.

Unity2D,34mq4s,tpsrep0rts,1 point,Sun May 3 04:02:39 2015 UTC,What I ended up doing was adding edge colliders in code to all exposed edges (a flat bit of ground that was 6 tiles long would get 1 collider) - I chose not to use edge over box colliders because I wanted walls and floors to have different physics materials.
Unity2D,34n9o4,TacDrol,2,Sat May 2 18:40:18 2015 UTC,"You can do something like this:      void Start()      {          StartCoroutine(ResetCollider());      }       IEnumerator ResetCollider()      {          this.gameObject.GetComponent().size = new Vector3(2,2,2);          Destroy(this.gameObject.GetComponent(""BoxCollider""));          yield return 0;          this.gameObject.AddComponent();      }   Pulled from [here]. I don't know why they set the size and stuff.... but it should give you an idea of what to do. The reason a co-routine is used is because while the Destroy is invoked that particular frame, the BoxCollider won't really be gone until the next loop.  Creating and Destroying things while the game is in motion is generally a good idea (process intensive), but as long as you are pooling and stuff everywhere else, a create/instantiate/destroy here or there is perfectly fine."

Also since the sprites start out as diagonal I can't use the box collider as it can't be rotated, but if I make it as a child object that would work. I could also make additional children with other collider types if necessary and enable them instead of creating and destroying them constantly.

Unity2D,34m7l1,Wahoozel,1 point,Sat May 2 12:22:19 2015 UTC,I'm think your first problem might be related to the size of the players or the tiles colliders. So i suggest seeing if they actually line up perfectly.  The second issue might be that you haven't lined up the tiles so they are all on one x value.  Hope at least one of my answers fixes it.  =)

Zoom in close and check the tile alignments or just make sure their transform.position.y is the same. Maybe making the collider on the player smaller would help? Are you only using physics for movement and player controls or are you using raycasts too?

I'm pretty sure that  if I re-worked it today it would work slightly different, but it did the job for when I released the code.  Edit - Removed sprint and horizontal movement portions of code to simplify  Edit - Thought I'd explain the mentality here after I refreshed myself on how my own code works. The ""keys to the kingdom"" (so to speak) here are the two booleans playerJumped and playerJumping and the jumpTimer. Both of these booleans become true when the player presses the jump button, and we store the current time of our jump into jumpTimer.  playerJumped is set back to false at the next physics/FixedUpdate, but playerJumping remains true until the player lets go of the jump button OR until the maximum allowed time for holding the button has passed, as can be seen in the GetButtonUp check line in Update().   In FixedUpdate, if the player has not let go of the button (ie; playerJumping is true) and a small amount of time has passed (Time.time - jumpTimer > delayToExtraJumpForce), we can add a bit of extra force to our jump. You basically mess around with the delay and the amount of extra force you want to give until it ""feels"" right.  using UnityEngine; using System.Collections;  public class JumpController: MonoBehaviour {      private float sprintTimer;       //Used in calculating the sprint delay     private bool jumpedDuringSprint; //Used to see if we jumped during our sprint      //Jump related variables     public float initialJumpForce;       //How much force to give to our initial jump     public float extraJumpForce;         //How much extra force to give to our jump when the button is held down     public float maxExtraJumpTime;       //Maximum amount of time the jump button can be held down for     public float delayToExtraJumpForce;  //Delay in how long before the extra force is added     private float jumpTimer;             //Used in calculating the extra jump delay     private bool playerJumped;           //Tell us if the player has jumped     private bool playerJumping;          //Tell us if the player is holding down the jump button     public Transform groundChecker;      //Gameobject required, placed where you wish ""ground"" to be detected from     private bool isGrounded;             //Check to see if we are grounded      void Update () {         //Casts a line between our ground checker gameobject and our player         //If the floor is between us and the groundchecker, this makes ""isGrounded"" true         isGrounded = Physics2D.Linecast(transform.position, groundChecker.position, 1 << LayerMask.NameToLayer(""Floor""));          //If our player hit the jump key, then it's true that we jumped!         if (Input.GetButtonDown(""Jump"") && isGrounded){             playerJumped = true;   //Our player jumped!             playerJumping = true;  //Our player is jumping!             jumpTimer = Time.time; //Set the time at which we jumped         }          //If our player lets go of the Jump button OR if our jump was held down to the maximum amount...         if (Input.GetButtonUp(""Jump"") || Time.time - jumpTimer > maxExtraJumpTime){             playerJumping = false; //... then set PlayerJumping to false         }      }      void FixedUpdate (){          //If our player pressed the jump key...         if (playerJumped){             rigidbody2D.AddForce(new Vector2(0,initialJumpForce)); //""Jump"" our player up in the air!             playerJumped = false; //Our player already jumped, so no need to jump again just yet         }          //If our player is holding the jump button and a little bit of time has passed...         if (playerJumping && Time.time - jumpTimer > delayToExtraJumpForce){             rigidbody2D.AddForce(new Vector2(0,extraJumpForce)); //... then add some additional force to the jump         }     } }"

Unity2D,34f1l4,kreaol,5,Thu Apr 30 16:39:53 2015 UTC,"I recently did one, so I'll just go ahead and leave this here:  http://pausebreakstudios.com/Downloads/TestProjects/MoveTest.zip  There is only one primary script, which you can view [here].  System: This is really more of a ""core"" grid-movement setup then a true-blue completed one. Movement direction is performed by detecting whether or not the default ""Horizontal/Vertical"" buttons have been pressed, which in turn feed the raw axis for the appropriate button (through a Vector2) into a simple function.   I know, it sounds complicated, but looking at the code (minus the comments), it's really only a few lines.   Additional configs:  * Gravity was set to 0  * The Enemy and Default(player) layers are set to not interact in the physics matrix (Edit>Project Settings>Physics 2D). They kept getting stuck to eachother.  Pros:   Pretty simple setup. You don't need much more then this when players and enemies alike ""take turns"" to walk around.   Cons:   Ideally you could just remove any rigidbodies for most games needing this sort of movement. Otherwise you have to do things like setting the the gravity to 0, always eliminating velocity (as kinematic bodies won't trigger collisions with each other), and making an additional call to double check that the positions are always whole/complete numbers. If enemies/player do NOT take turns to walk (ie; real time), then a system needs to be setup to tell enemies/players if an object is already moving from and to a tile. You can see this behaviour easily in Final Fantasy 1: NPCs already moving to a new tile will take up BOTH tiles until the movement is done."

Years of programming, and still re-learning the basics, ;)   Is there a difference between how the code is executed? Performance costs? etc...?   Now THAT'S a hot debate, notably on the performance side. Computationally, casting from one type to another is probably more expensive. But does the memory cost of constructing a new Vector2 outweigh that computational cost? The answer is: Who cares.  The cast cost is so nominal that it really just boils down to your preferred style. I'll probably stick with doing it the previous way, because it clicks in my brain better. For me, it's the same reason why I write ""shootSpeed = shootSpeed + 5;"" instead of ""shootSpeed += 5;"": Arguably the latter is ""easier"" to read, but I prefer the former.

I want to get used to being able to swap out any art assets with final products down the road.  One question for people that do their own tiles, in my video you can see when the player moves to the edge by the water he is partially standing over the water. How would you deal with this? Should I remake those tiles and instead of having the edge tile being mostly land with water at the edge make another one that is mostly water with the edge of land on it and then a collider so you can not walk on that tile?  As it stands right now it looks weird when you are on the edge as the players foot is on the water.  I made the movement very basic, it just moves 1 unit in game which is a tile and I made my script check for getaxisraw going back to zero so that each keypress or movement on an analog controller will only move the player one space.  void Update ()  {     if (!alreadyMoved)     {         if (Input.GetAxisRaw(""Horizontal"") == 1)         {             transform.Translate(Vector3.right);              alreadyMoved = true;                     }         else if (Input.GetAxisRaw(""Horizontal"") == -1)         {             transform.Translate(Vector3.left);                           alreadyMoved = true;         }         else if (Input.GetAxisRaw(""Vertical"") == 1)         {             transform.Translate(Vector3.up);                 alreadyMoved = true;                     }         else if (Input.GetAxisRaw(""Vertical"") == -1)         {             transform.Translate(Vector3.down);                           alreadyMoved = true;         }                    }     else if (Input.GetAxisRaw(""Horizontal"") == 0 && Input.GetAxisRaw(""Vertical"") == 0)     {         alreadyMoved = false;     }            }"

Unity2D,34f1l4,BillyTheBanana,2,Tue May 5 19:45:58 2015 UTC,"Just a thought: You could do something like so in the future:      public void moveCharacter(Vector3 point1, Vector3 point2, Vector3 point3){         if(!LeanTween.isTweening(gameObject)){              LTBezierPath ltPath = new LTBezierPath(new Vector3[]{ transform.position,             transform.position + point1,             transform.position + point2,             transform.position + point3});              LeanTween.move(gameObject,ltPath.pts,0.35f).setEase(LeanTweenType.easeInOutQuad).setOnComplete(CheckTileBeneath).setId(1);         }     }   Then you would just replace your current calls to ""UpRight, UpLeft, etc"" with just ""moveCharacter"", and input the vectors in the function call, like so (pulling values from your current DownLeft function):      moveCharacter(new Vector3(0.5f,0.25f,0),new Vector3(1f,0.5f,0),new Vector3(1f,-1f,0)); //DownLeft   Way less lines of code to mess with, and if you need to tweak something you only have to update the function call itself versus updating four entire functions.   I did this in my current 2.5D game which also uses four directional movements, with the addition of shooting rays in the required direction. The whole ""move"" section of my code is pretty big/robust, but I get to hide it way down below the code and only need to see/adjust the function call as needed. It was that way before I brought in new art assets, and since there were size differences I was easily able to adjust the values on the fly."

If your flipper and ball are moving fast enough in opposite directions, they may miss each other during all of the collision checks. Hope I'm making sense!"

Thank you :)"
Unity2D,34g2gj,kreaol,2,Thu Apr 30 21:28:24 2015 UTC,"You should use MoveRotation for the rotation of the flippers BOTH ways. Additionally, set your ball's rigidbody collision detection from ""Discrete"" to ""Continuous"". Lastly, as the flippers are stationary and the ball is doing the moving, you can set the rigidbodies of the flippers to Kinematic.  AddTorque is similar to AddForce: Both should really be used for small, continuous amounts, not insta-force things. The alternatives are adjusting the angularVelocity (for rotation) or velocity (for movement). Don't believe the silly documentation:   In most cases you should not modify it directly, as this can result in unrealistic behaviour.   It's such a silly statement: Most games are unrealistic in the first place. Reserve AddForce and AddTorque for games that require rockets/planes/cars/etc, things that need to gradually speed up. All other games SHOULD adjust the velocity/angularVelocity directly, or their counterparts MovePosition and MoveRotation."

Two more gifs I found interesting:   http://i.imgur.com/37trKxZ.gif (point defense, and intersecting shots) http://i.imgur.com/3hJhRdL.webm (turret tracking and it's raycast line)     The turrets will follow the target with the highest priority that is within the view range of them. However if any other ship comes within their attack range, it will target it instead.   When that unit leaves it's attack range it will check against all units currently within the view range and select the highest priority one to follow if no others are within range to attack.  You may have noticed how the turrets down't shoot at the fast moving fighters all the time. The turret does not shoot unless some part of the target is in the immediate direction it is facing.    If anyone is interested in a tutorial, I'll probably write one out in several parts to cover how to get basic turret mechanics working.  To Do: Make it so turrets don't always shoot at the center of the enemy unit. Make the range detection work for the entire hitbox of the enemy, not just it's center (ships nose can be within range, but it does not shoot)."

When you let go, divide your distance from the starting point by the total distance possible. That will give you a number between 0 and 1.  Make an Public AnimationCurve and evaluate it at your new normalized distance. Use that returned value as your ""thrust"".  In the inspector, modify this AnimationCurve so that the y values fit the feel you are looking for. The closer the x of the curve is to 1, the y should be the value you want for the ""thrust"" at your max distance. Conversely, the closer to 0 on the x, set your y value to the ""thrust"" you'd like to see at the lowest value."

The most obvious comparison is Doodle Jump - but our game is no where near a clone or copy.  Jump Boy was made by two friends in our free time on the weekends. The goal was to hone our skills, stay productive outside of work, and actually complete a project. Instead of just throwing around ideas and making prototypes in Unity. So we started with a small endless jumping game as our first project and learned a lot in the process. We accomplished what we wanted to make on all fronts and are proud of our game. Our goal was not to reinvent the wheel or make money."

About the copy thing, I only said that because I though again you just wanted money and the easiest way is to make clones of other games.  Last you can call this a clone of copy,  if there is already a game like this then it's a copy,  but again as for a first game it's good practice to copy other games but not to make money out of them.

Unity2D,34d3g6,PlayKiseki,2,Thu Apr 30 18:05:40 2015 UTC,I truthfully don't know why we chose to use Trilinear over Bilinear. I think we assumed more was better and just kept doing it... :P  Does turning off the Generate Mip Maps option make the sprites look better?
Unity2D,34d3g6,PlayKiseki,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:48:59 2015 UTC,"haha hey, I can respect that logic for keeping it :p  I think so.

As you can imagine, this caused a ton of issues with anything that wasn't a high-end device.     In the end, want to know what we did? Cut the resolution of every asset in half. That's right, everything in the game was now 50% smaller than when it first released. The difference in quality was barely noticeable at all, and with some additional atlasing thanks to tk2d, now it takes up just under 170MB of RAM and the APK is under Google Play's 50MB limit.

How do you see how much ram your game is using on your device?   And when you say you cut the resolution in half for every asset, do you mean you physically lowered the resolution via photoshop or whatever, or, in Unity, you just made the assets a scale of .5 for the X and Y coordinates?  edit -   I just looked at your game (love the art btw)  My game also uses a lot of background scrolling. Quick two questions if you do not mind.  1.) Are you Pooling those objects?  2.)

With the white fog/cloud thing.  Man, your game is definitely visually pleasing. I will definitely play more as I am laying in bed tonight.  Well, Object Pooling confuses me because the Unity manual doesn't good a good example of it and when you look online, there are TONS of different ways people do it.  So, I used this example someone posted here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/32s23p/simple_object_pooling_for_unity/  As it is the easiest. Here is all I have to do for his script:  /// Usage: ///  ///   There's no need to do any special setup of any kind. ///  ///   Instead of call Instantiate(), use this: ///       SimplePool.Spawn(somePrefab, somePosition, someRotation); ///  ///   Instead of destroying an object, use this: ///       SimplePool.Despawn(myGameObject); ///  ///   If desired, you can preload the pool with a number of instances: ///       SimplePool.Preload(somePrefab, 20);       So, I changed my code:  Instantiate(enemies[index], enemies[index].transform.position, enemies[index].transform.rotation);   To his:  SimplePool.Spawn(enemies[index], enemies[index].transform.position, enemies[index].transform.rotation);           What I changed is a snippet of my Coroutine that spawns random enemies from an array.  My enemy object is just a single parent-child object. The parent is the enemy, and the child is a small transparent image attached to the enemy and is called ""score object"". it has a collider so when the player dodges an enemy, he hits the score object child and a point is given.  However, the score object is never spawned again after the second pool is spawned >.<"
Unity2D,34d3g6,AniMoney,1 point,Tue May 5 04:07:45 2015 UTC,"Hi, sorry for the late reply!  I'm so so so honored that it reminds you of NiGHTs!!! That was a top inspiration for the game! In fact, I'm sending a letter to Yuji Naka, to tell him about how he was a big inspiration for Sagasu! Hopefully he'll read it and enjoy the game!  When the game launched, the UI was really static and inconsistent and stuff. One night I was just laying in bed and got an image in my head of how to make it better and I did a complete overhaul in like 3 days XD The official UI tutorials from Unity were a really big help!  For the transitions, it's just a big gameObject that has the could sprites attached. When the player hits a certain point, the next stage is enabled and set to the edge of the clouds, and then when the player hits a second point, the previous stage is deactivated.  As for your pooling problem, I'm not sure since my pooling is a lot different (and more rudimentary) than Quill's solution. Could it be that the prefab being pooled doesn't have the child attached? Could you also add the score object to the player, which detects when an enemy is dodged? Sorry I couldn't be more help!"

From there you basically just want to set a PlayerPrefs flag that unlocks whatever you had locked in the free/ad version. Have your Soomla purchase switch that flag and you're good to go.

I wouldn't mind running such a thread if a worthy mod won't be found.  Both /r/Unity3D & /r/Unity2D can have there own subreddits targeting a different way to use unity. This is 2D and we can focus on problems plaguing 2D development. As a community we can find solutions to some of the problems all of us face.  Here at /r/Unity2d it would be cool to see different approaches to 2D specific problems. I'm working on my 2D game, and it would be cool to see how the community develops a solution to a basic problem. One problem I would like to see if this idea ever comes to light would be a : Weapons System. There are hundreds of different types of weapons systems I could make. I want to see how the community would approach such an idea.   For Unity developer who have actually heard of Ludum Dare, we can have a LD thread prior to the event. A thread where everyone can show off skills they want to implement into there submission. This would also be a great idea to spark creativity and learn new skills.  Such a thread would be cool to see here and also in the /r/Unity3D community.   What do the mods and think?"
Unity2D,34bv0h,drock577,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:00:48 2015 UTC,Yea i was thinking to keep it just 2D and if people like it someone else could do a 3d one. I am thinking of making it as its own subreddit though.  That way its dedicated just to unity2D challenges and no clutter from everything else posted.  I am brainstorming ideas and thinking of names and then i will create it.  Your weapon system idea is one of the reasons i want to keep the topics/challenges open to users to submit. That way everyone gets a turn picking what we choose.  I like your comment about seeing how other people implement things to learn from.  People could share their code too if they wish to show people how they achieved something. (Obviously only if they choose to do so).
Unity2D,34bv0h,drock577,2,Wed Apr 29 23:07:52 2015 UTC,"If the mods allow it, and you can target it to the Unity developers, why not hold it here?   I like the idea of its own subreddit, but it would need more content. If you do a subreddit target it to the unity demographic and hold challenges for both 2D & 3D, just starting different days. From there allow it to be a place where developer can request different ways to solve a simple & basic problem. Open it up as a casual collaboration subreddit.

Personally I think a lot of us are busy with bigger projects so maybe having it as a weekly thing instead of daily would be better. Ideally it should be something that could be done as quickly as an hour, but also take the whole week if someone wants to flesh it out.  Have like a simple task, like ""make an inventory system"" or ""make a simple match 3 puzzle game"", and then maybe have optional advanced challenges for people who have more time, skill, or need some direction, such as ""allow items to be combined in the inventory"" or ""add in wild gems (any color) to the match 3 puzzle game"".  It would also be great if free art/sound was provided in the post so people can get started right away. Obviously they don't have to but it would save some time since this is mostly for practice.  Also we could share ideas, code-snippets, .gifs, etc. I think it would be just good to have discussion on how people tackle problems differently. If people want to share the code on github or whatever that's up to them of course.  Having it run on this subreddit is fine, since it's not that busy anyways."

It depends on the size of your sprites and how many frames, but a spritesheet can easily end up megabytes in size, so if you might end up with a lot of them for different characters, and you're running on mobile, the saving in memory could certainly be significant, not only for the sake of main memory space and app download size but for the sake of the GPU having to swap textures less often."

I ended up having to re-write my tilemap importer for my SpriteSomething app to work with padding because of the issue.   I tried every different import setting to try to make it not happen but the only way I was able to solve is the 1px padding.   Maybe you could solve it by writing a custom sprite re-importer that doesn't lose all your sprite names and moved them over by a 1px padding amount. That's what I would do.

Do u know of a method to check the childrens childrens children of the most root object?   If you need to get more specific than the GetComponentInChildren methods allow, you'll have to navigate the children yourself. You can manually look at a transform's children by using a foreach loop to get at the Enumerator (I use C#, by the way, not sure if it works the same in UnityScript).  foreach(Transform child in gameObject.transform) {      //Do stuff }   Use nested loops (or recursion if you're comfortable with that) to go as deep as you want."

Unity2D,345pu7,Harabeck,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:06:23 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah I know there's no real ""right"" answer for this, it's just that all the tutorials I've seen have been for beginners without programming experience. As a result, the way things are done aren't really conducive to a game with good modularity.  Do you think you could give a simple example of when you would choose an interface over a component?"
Unity2D,345pu7,Harabeck,2,Tue Apr 28 15:48:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not sure I see it as interfaces versus components, they aren't interchangeable in my mind. Interfaces are for when another script will need to talk to other scripts, but different things may happen ""under the hood"" for each class that implements the interface. Components are best used when various objects will be doing the exact same kind of behavior.   Examples:  When to create a new component versus inheritance is pretty much the same as any other project. Does it save you from code reuse? In my current project, I have Towers and Creeps that both inherit from Pawn. Pawn handles damage and status effects, while Creep has stuff for moving that Tower doesn't need, and Tower has stuff for animating its turret.  An example of an interface I used in a previous project was for my AI. It needed to evaluate the threat of both the player and other AI (which may or not be friendly to it). As part of this, I wanted to the AI to be able to peek at the target list of the threat. So, I had both the player and AI implement an ITargeter interface. Typically, you use triggers to see what is near a moving object, and that gives you the collider of what entered the trigger, and that has a reference to the gameObject. But, now you need the component that has the information you want. As of Unity 5, you can use GetComponent<>() and pass in an interface to the generic parameter and get any component that implements it (note that in case of inheritance, you can pass in a parent class, of course). So my AI's OnTrigger can use collider.gameObject.GetComponent<ITargeter>() to see if a relevant component exists, and then work with it.  A component example: Going back to my current project, I put some code in Pawn so that Turrets and Creeps would set their sprites' order in layer based partially on the Y component of their transform.position. Our perspective is pseudo three-quarters, so anything above another object on the Y should be drawn as behind it. Later, I decided that my towers that spawn friendly creeps needed a rally point flag, but that this shouldn't interact with things as Pawns do. They don't collide, attack, or have health. Also, this particular bit of functionality only really needs to talk to the sprites, and isn't dependent on other things going on in the game. So, I took that code out of Pawn and put it in a separate component so that I could put it on both the rally flags and the Pawns. With only inheritance, my options would have been code duplication or adding layers to the inheritance tree to make room for something even simpler than a Pawn.  Let me know if you have any more questions."

Rather, the background layers follow the player around the level, creating the illusion?

What I meant by avoiding camera magic was doing weird things like setting up more then one camera, with one camera being Perspective (for ""true"" parallax) and the main camera being orthographic. It can look nice, but can be weird to fiddle with.   does that not mean that the parallaxing effect for each layer moving at a different speed would be lost?   The script accounts for that. Give each ""layer"" a higher value in layerFactorOffset. Give layers a larger number the closer they are to the player. Dividing by the variable will make the positional movements smaller IE; ""slower"" the larger the value is.   Rather, the background layers follow the player around the level, creating the illusion?   Bingo. Typical 2D parallaxing is an illusion anyways, as the general theory of parallaxing is simply that objects move slower the farther they are away.

But what I ended up doing was dropping Unity's animation system and going with 2dToolkit's animations. This way I can use the same animation controller and overwrite the sprite for each animation based on changing clothes/layers. Then I have a base skin sprite with each layer as a child of the skin. When someone changes a shirt for example, I have a script that gets the shirt layer's animation component, get the animations, loop over each frame and reassign a new sprite (sprites are named like SpriteLayer/SpriteName/FrameNumber where the same frame is the same on all sheets like ""walk-down1"" is frame 3). Then the animations just happen like before but with the new sprites. I've yet to have an issue with doing it like this and IMO is better than the Unity method because I'm not having to update the spriterenderer each frame after unity's animation system has already updated the sprite renderer.

This is what my code looks like for one layer, it should be enough to give you an idea:  private Dictionary<string, string> _names = new Dictionary<string, string>(); public string Skin {     get {         return _names[""Skin""];     }     set {         //if value chaged         _names[""Skin""] = value;         if(value != null){             //skin changed, need to loop through animation and set frame ids             //get the library of animationa from the animator             tk2dSpriteAnimation lib = animator.Library;             //if a library was found             if(lib != null){                 //loop over each clip in the library                 foreach(tk2dSpriteAnimationClip clip in lib.clips){                     //loop over each frame in the clip                     foreach(tk2dSpriteAnimationFrame frame in clip.frames){                         //get the sprite name for the current sprite and split into it's parts                         string[] spriteName = frame.spriteCollection.spriteDefinitions[frame.spriteId].name.Split('/');                         //overwrite the frame id with the frame id from the new sprite matched by name                         frame.spriteId = frame.spriteCollection.GetSpriteIdByName(_names[""Skin""] + ""/"" + spriteName[1]);                     }                 }             }         }         //if we are currently standing, restart the standing animation because it is static and doesn't loop         if(_action == Action.Stand){             animator.Play(_action.ToString() + "" "" + _direction.ToString());         }     } }   I use the dictionary _names to map the currently worn item sprite name. I have a sprite collection with all the sprites and a reference to the tk2dSpriteAnimator (named animator) above in the code. When you set the ""Skin"" property on the player's controller (that's where this resides), I get the animations, loop over each clip in the animation library and loop over each frame in each one of those clips. Then get the current sprite name. This would be something like ""MaleSkin1/3"" where MaleSkin1 is the name of the sprite and 3 is the frame number. Where the frame number is the same frame for all of the sprites (like running right frames are frame numbers 11-16 on all my spritesheets; makes it easy to line them up). I then split the name on the ""/"" separator and look up in the tk2d sprite collection the new sprite id by name which would be named ""MaleSkin2/3"" (or whatever the new sprite was named followed by the frame number)."

I meant to mention it last time... I remember when you first posted your castle and day/night transition and REALLY liking it. But as soon as you brought in the characters... It just doesn't fit. Like the scale is wrong (characters too big) and it doesn't seem to fit the mood.  Also: Please do not do foreground trees... It reminds me of the foreground pillars in Batman Forever on Sega. It's not fair that enemies can potentially be hidden behind them and you get hit because they were never visible.

My game isn't as good as on iPads since an Ipad is not 16:9 (which my game is made for)  What exactly is this line of code you have for:  // determine the game window's current aspect ratio float windowaspect = (float)Screen.width / (float)Screen.height;   I know you say it's to determine the current aspect ratio. But I don't see how it gets that info from that line of code, especially since it is the same as the above code where I will put:  float targetaspect = (1920f)Screen.width / (1080f)Screen.height;  Or am I even doing that code wrong?"
Unity2D,33x5vv,cadisguy,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:23:02 2015 UTC,"Using (float) before any variable, simply makes sure that the program reads that variable as a float instead of an integer. This is called casting. When I write :    (float)variableA / (float)variableB   it will return a float result. If I were to write :   (int)variableA / (int) variableB    it's going to return an integer result.   It probably doesn't look like it makes much sense here, since the first variable is already a float, but I'm used to casting just to stay on the safe side.   So yeah, (float)Screen.Width / (float)Screen.height just returns the aspect of the current game window. Optimally, if you want your game to keep the ratio of every screen/device, just use the exact code and link it to the camera. It will get the current screen aspect, and scale your screen to that.   But if you want your app to keep a single aspect no matter where your game is running.    // set the desired aspect ratio, I set it to fit every screen   float targetaspect = (float)desiredWidth / (float)desiredHeight;   if you have numbers then you'll write down :    float targetaspect = 1920f / 1080f;"

And I tried to avoid using update because I used the same code you just provided, yet it would call the spawner for 5 - 6 frames repetitively before realizing that the if statement is false.. Nvm nvm, there were multiple spawners so that's what created this issue. I'll try using your code with a few changes, thanks again :)"

Unity2D,33twj8,shirtface,6,Sat Apr 25 16:19:49 2015 UTC,"To go to your direct question: Look at my pixel-art banner for a project I have.. It's honestly not the best, but doesn't look half bad. I spent HOURS over the course of 2-3 weeks to get that far, NOT including animations. Pixel Artists that do art for a living would run circles around me.  Then look at my logo. I didn't make this (though I now own the rights): I paid an artist $50 for it. He made it in <30 minutes. I eventually realized that my art will never go anywhere unless I spend MONTHS honing my skill, and doing so would ultimately mean doing something I don't really like to do.  As you begin to get more confident in what you are able to do, you need to start deciding what you ultimately want to achieve.  If you're going to be an indie game developer with their own studio, realize that you will not be able to do all you art, sound, programming, design, marketing, sales, legal, accounting (the list goes on...) all by yourself. Even if you COULD do it all yourself, you would have to be a genius to do all of them well.  If you want to work FOR a studio, realize that most studios don't need generalists. Most slightly-bigger-then-small-studios want AI engineers, level designers, animators, etc. Specializing in something puts you above 90%-95% of the game devs out there. Even in specialization, do not worry about ""programmer"" art. Unless you're applying for an art'sy role, the studio wants to see a portfolio of cool things, good looking or not. I have talked to hiring studios: They. Do. Not. Care about programmer art. They don't even care if the game is done, as long as it does something cool.  Even shipping a game with programmer art puts you over at least 80% of the ""game devs"" out there. Put a price on your time: Eventually you'll probably find you'd have wasted less time working a minimum-wage job and paying an artist then trying to do it yourself."

This is essential if you want to propagate your work at a steady rate. When you create a character, draw a template so that you can use that base as a model for a thousand more characters.

I eventually found that I got better results by making models in Art Of Illusion and putting the rendered results in my game, and animating them with code (by deforming the meshes).  There are sometimes code-based solutions to these problems.  Alternatively, look for a style that doesn't require much drawing skill.  That's largely why pixel art is so popular, but it's not the only possibility.  My game Balloon Platform Defense only gave me difficulty when doing the human characters (which is when I used the solution above) - everything else was made of basic shapes.  And earlier I was playtesting a game called Supercoil - I doubt the author of that worried much about his drawing skills either.  Try to find a game theme where most stuff is made of primitive shapes, or where little art is required."

Unity2D,33lz3a,couchdude,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:35:21 2015 UTC,I hope we aren't limited to the XY axis. At the very least I'd like to rotate the finished map. I use 2Dtoolkit because I can rotate the tilemap to XZ because A* Pathfinding Project wonks out when rotating on the XY axis. Don't need this and either way 2D unity colliders don't rotate to other planes.  Also curious if it supports 3D physics on the tiles.

Because I want to make a 2D game :D  I just happen to need 3D colliders for pathfinding.  Right now I have a topdown 2D game. I have A* Pathfinding project grid graph. I have it so the tilemap is the same size as the grid graph, so there's a node on each tile. The pathfinding solution raycasts from above the node through it and if it hits anything that node isn't walkable. Need 3D colliders so my tiles have tops.  EDIT - Also I just got the rotation working. For something on the XZ plane it would seem like just rotating it 90 on the X axis would put it in the XY plane, then rotating the Z axis to turn it while keeping it on the XY plane. No. Well what about Y axis, it just cancels the Z axis. Forums mentioned gimbal lock, I don't know. Point is rotating the graph that sits on the XZ plane so Y and Z are 90 then puts it on the XY plane and allows X to rotate the graph on what is actually the world z axis."

Unity2D,33m8uk,ActionHotdog,5,Thu Apr 23 17:45:43 2015 UTC,"All math is useful for some aspect of game development, even in 2D.  The most useful ones are physics, geometry, trigonometry, and linear algebra. Physics comes in handy even if you aren't using Unity's physics, since it relates on acceleration, velocity, and position relate (as /u/DemFineGlutes mentioned). Geometry is useful all-around as it helps with your spatial understanding, in addition to all those theorems about angles which come in handy for calculating trajectories and whatnot. Trigonometry is pivotal for determining angles between objects, distances to surfaces of objects, etc.  Linear algebra is supremely important. Whenever you change any part of a Transform or have a parent-child relationship in your hierarchy, you're dealing with linear algebra. Understanding how matrices and quaternions work, why order of operations for matrix/quaternion operations matter, and how to visualize the result will really help you even with 2D development. I just replied last night to a separate thread pointing out how to solve a 2D movement problem with linear algebra, if you want to see a real-world scenario for it."

Unity2D,33hoxj,nicloay,8,Wed Apr 22 16:38:21 2015 UTC,In my opinion I think you need some gameplay elements that break up the core mechanic.  It seems your game revolves around puzzle solving and managing movement of the blocks. I would suggest adding in different block types that have different effects. For example:   A block that can only be placed/removed once A block that gives you a higher jump if you place it A block that slowly deteriorates over time A block that grows vertically when placed   I think adding in these types of things to the blocks that you are picking up will add a really nice dynamic to your game and allow for more diverse and interesting mechanics.  Just my personal suggestion though :)
Unity2D,33hoxj,JayOhh,5,Wed Apr 22 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot man!  Your ideas is very awesome. Main problem in the game play that level is very tall and the time required for the level is about 15-20 minutes, and with these elements it could be much more interesting.

In this sort of puzzle platformer, levels are usually relatively short and fast-paced, at least at the beginning of the game. This helps the user get a grasp of the mechanics easily, as well as giving them the rewarding feeling of finishing more levels.  I would recommend maybe cutting up the level into smaller, more manageable and faster levels? I know if I'm picking up a new puzzle game, I wouldn't want to spend 20 minutes on the first level unless I was already invested into it! Just my 2 cents :)"

Unity2D,33jcve,kreaol,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:25:04 2015 UTC,"What you need to do is called a change of basis. You have an arbitrary coordinate system (where one axis is defined by the direction your object is moving), and Mathf.Sin operates in standard Cartesian coordinates.  You can compute your object's position in its local coordinate system by using Mathf.Sin - the longer the object lives, the further away it is, and it oscillates on the Y axis. That's what you have now, essentially.  From that position, you then rotate it to world space. Transform.RotateAround should work for this - your 'point' parameter is the origin, your axis is positive Z, and the angle is Mathf.Atan2(direction.y, direction.x).  Now that you have it rotated properly, you have to translate it to the object's position. Transform.Translate does the trick here.  Note that order of operations matters here! If you translate before rotating, the result is not what you want (but I encourage you to try it to see how different it is)."

You can send values TO an instantiated object by doing (from your enemy ship script):  GameObject tempBullet = Instantiate(myBullet, transform.position, Quaternion.identity) as GameObject; tempBullet.GetComponent<BulletScript>().GiveBulletSpeed(enemyShipSpeed);   In your BulletScript, you would have a ""GiveBulletSpeed (float additionalSpeed)"" function (or a different function to set other values/do other things with the bullet) that then uses the function's additionalSpeed float to add to some default bullet speed.  Honestly though, I don't know how fast you expect ships to go, but I'd find it weird to play a game where the bullets become faster. You'd probably reach the point of un-dodge-ability REALLY fast (if physics just didn't work anymore after that point).  edit  Like /u/JayOhh hinted though: It'd be helpful to have more relevant code.

Unity2D,33irdd,kreaol,4,Wed Apr 22 21:38:50 2015 UTC,"What are their counterparts?   I think you might be referring to what I edited into my message later and shortly removed afterwards: Effectively there are no counterparts (outside of rolling your own code).  What I had meant to refer to was using Rays vs. Rigidbodies. In a top-down game, I'd lean away from Rigidbodies and use Rays instead. This way, we can avoid issues with gravity and colliders while in this perspective. Notably, we don't want players to get stuck when they touch the top or ""head"" part of an enemy. With rays, you would simply have no rigidbodies and all colliders set to triggers, firing rays out to detect collision.  You COULD use rigidbodies, but you would need to set a box collider for the feet of the player/enemy and a second trigger type collider for the rest of the body, as well as eliminate gravity and ensure nothing goes flying off the screen.   Another way is to have a transparent sprite that is used solely as a collider be put on top of the tile sprite.    This is pretty much no different from the first thing you mentioned. Only you don't really need a ""transparent sprite"". You would just create an empty game object, attach a collider, and resize the collider as needed. Using this method really only relys on how you're going to be moving your character around: Normally though I'd just attach the collider and movement script directly to the primary sprite gameobject.   I have read about people doing both and Tiled (which I am not using) has a built in method for doing the latter.   I assume you mean Tiled2Unity, in which case it has the capability of creating a game object that houses all the colliders on a single object for the scene, though in some case you might need to add in manual colliders on a different object or have various layers (like when you need to disable a part of a wall or something)."
Unity2D,33irdd,kreaol,2,Thu Apr 23 03:14:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I have not come across using raycasts for normal collision detection. I am having some difficulty seeing the concept (it makes much more sense for line of sight, etc., than for normal collisions to me). Unity explains it like this:  ""Additionally, this will also detect Collider(s) at the start of the ray. In this case the ray is starting inside the Collider and doesn't intersect the Collider surface. This means that the collision normal cannot be calculated in which case the collision normal returned is set to the inverse of the ray vector being tested. This can easily be detected because such results are always at a RaycastHit2D fraction of zero.""  So the raycast originates within the collider and fills the entire area until it touches the end of the collider and uses those bounds? Would you be able to explain this a little more?   You COULD use rigidbodies, but you would need to set a box collider for the feet of the player/enemy and a second trigger type collider for the rest of the body, as well as eliminate gravity and ensure nothing goes flying off the screen.   All tutorials that I've seen used rigidbody2D for movement and collision, even the few top-down tutorials. Do you think that this is because it is easier to grasp? Also, isn't eliminating gravity as simple as setting it to 0 and perhaps checking ""fixed angle"" in the RigidBody2D component, or am I missing something?  I definitely pondered the feet/rest of the body colliders problem in the context of a top-down game. How would raycasting solve it?"
Unity2D,33irdd,kreaol,3,Thu Apr 23 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"So the raycast originates within the collider and fills the entire area until it touches the end of the collider and uses those bounds? Would you be able to explain this a little more?   No, it's just a fancy way for them to say ""Don't raycast from WITHIN a collider, silly"".   A ray is pretty much an invisible laser beam that generally shoots out from any point in the world and out in a direction that you specify. There's more parameters (like distance to travel, etc), but I digress. Some will use a separate empty game object for the starting position(like a ""gun tip"" for a gun), but you can also just offset the starting position of the ray however you like if you're basing the position off of the center of a collider (like a box collider on your player).   By default, the ray will shoot out almost-infinitely into the world until it hits a collider. You can store the hit information in RaycastHit2D, which itself contains information like the collider that was hit, the distance the ray traveled when it hit, etc.  A lot of people choose to not use rays as they tend to be a bit harder to understand and generally require more code (more or less) then just the drag&drop RigidBody2D component. I'm also under the assumption that many people believe rays are more expensive, but it really depends on how you use them. I'd say you could shoot 50-100 rays a FRAME without much impact to most devices (definitely not PCs).   All tutorials that I've seen used rigidbody2D for movement and collision, even the few top-down tutorials. Do you think that this is because it is easier to grasp?    Yes, in many senses it's easier to grasp the idea of a rididbody (ie; your giving your object a body made up of mass in order to be effected by gravity).   Also, isn't eliminating gravity as simple as setting it to 0 and perhaps checking ""fixed angle"" in the RigidBody2D component, or am I missing something?   FixedAngle would just mean your character won't rotate on the XYZ planes. If you set gravity to ""0"", you would need to constantly remove any velocity due to collider collisions; You've effectively created ""space"" ie; no gravity. Any amount of velocity/force would cause the object to ""float"" around.   I definitely pondered the feet/rest of the body colliders problem in the context of a top-down game. How would raycasting solve it?   So say in your hack'n'slash, when you swing your sword or punch you would shoot a ray in your facing direction. If an enemy was within range, the ray would hit the enemies trigger collider. Example:     RaycastHit2D tempHit = Physics2D.Raycast(startingPoint, transform.right, 3);    if (tempHit)){   So if our ray hit something, it will store it in tempHit. Otherwise, tempHit will be ""null"" and thus result in ""false"" when evaluated. We could then proceed to do a FURTHER check:     RaycastHit2D tempHit = Physics2D.Raycast(startingPoint, transform.right, 3);    if (tempHit)){     //Don't be scared of Mathf.Abs! It just means ""return the absolution value ie; always return a positive value     if(Mathf.abs(transform.position.y) - Mathf.abs(tempHit.gameObject.transform.position.y) > 1)   We're saying: If my ray hit something, check to see if the Y position of my player and the thing we hit are within a certain range/distance. This way, if we aren't closely aligned enough with the enemy, we can ignore the enemy even though our raycast hit the enemies collider.  You can see a simple example project [here].. Someday I'll finish the project... I promise!   All tutorials that I've seen used rigidbody2D for movement and collision, even the few top-down tutorials.    The ""Unity 5 - 2D Platformer Series"" tutorial in the sidebar uses raycasts extensively."

If you set gravity to ""0"", you would need to constantly remove any velocity due to collider collisions; You've effectively created ""space"" ie; no gravity. Any amount of velocity/force would cause the object to ""float"" around.   One of the issues I'm having is a slight ""bounce back"" effect when the player character, using a Rigidbody2D, collides with a static sprite without a Rigidbody. Do you think that this is due to me accessing the player character's Rigidbody via code and creating an effect via velocity? In other words, my movement is created with the Rigidbody2D.velocity method, not through transform.position translations.  Also, if I am not using Rigidbodies, I'm assuming that I should be moving via simple translations like transform.position and not via velocity?  Thanks for the project link - if I decide to use raycasting, I will take a look at the code, as well as that of the default tutorial's."
Unity2D,33irdd,couchdude,2,Thu Apr 23 20:51:47 2015 UTC,"Do you think that this is due to me accessing the player character's Rigidbody via code and creating an effect via velocity?   No, this is due to the Physics ChecksCollision Detection value of your player's Rigidbody. In your players Rigidbody, change ""Discrete"" to ""Continuous"".   Also, if I am not using Rigidbodies, I'm assuming that I should be moving via simple translations like transform.position and not via velocity?   Correct, you would be moving via Transform.Translate or directly modifying transform.position. Both methods would break collisions though, as they effectively ""teleport"" the object. That's where raycasts come in.  You can also view Fap#8 if you want to see simple top-down controls for rigidbodies. [Link]"

Reading up on it, it now makes sense while it would only sometimes happen: ""Continuous: A collision is registered if the object’s collider appears to have contacted another between updates."" Since I'm using the movement code within FixedUpdate(), collision was not detected at certain frames.

In addition to his comments I would recommend the zombies he get pushed back slightly with their hit animation. Feedback when the player gets hit. Same as with the zombies. Could possibly add some screen shake to it to make it feel more connected to the player. Improved UI elements. /u/KenNL has a great UI pack, check it out here Little touches like shadows for the player and zombies (even just blobby shadows) can make a big difference Different hit animations when performed in a row could add a nice bit of flavour as well   Edit:  Forgot that /u/KenNL also has a UI pack targeted towards brawlers / fighters, would work well for your purposes.

You would hit Unity's limits pretty quick (Unity and physics uses 32bit numbers (including before/after decimal) so after 7 digits your transform starts losing precision from milli/centi/deci...etc).  IMO, it would be better to just log the starting position, Do the math for floor(distance traveled/points every X units) or Mathf.floor((start.y-transform.y)/5) (I use c#, don't know if it is the same in JS) and just constantly update the score on each frame."

Each collider has to check every other collider (which makes it about On2 without any sort of culling). There are three four main ways to make it better, in rough order of probable usefulness:   Use less colliders. If your enemies area each using multiple colliders/triggers, try consolidating them into as few as possible. For instance, if you have separate colliders for enemy heads, limbs and bodies, switch it to a single collider. Use only primitive colliders when possible. Circle colliders are the most efficient, followed by box. Only use polygon colliders if you absolutely have to. Make sure you are using layers so that things that don't need to interact have their layer interactions turned off in the physics settings. In your case, consider letting the enemies not collide with each other, and maintain logical separation through some other means within their behaviors, such as steering techniques(do be careful though, a bad steering implementation will also be slow). Find a way to spread them out, so that AABB bounding allows them to not have to consider each other."

If anyone was curious, the specifics of my setup are: - Enemy main body hosts a CircleCollider2D and Rigidbody2D, they are currently all IsKinematic during testing. - Enemy child object hosts the radar CircleCollider2D and an IsTrigger RigidBody2D, which is used for detecting targets. These are also IsKinematic.   I'm going to do some debugging of the performance now to try and find the specific source, if its any specific case (i.e. removing colliders/rigids from the main bodies, then the radar children, then testing code thereafter if any of them appear to the be the primary source. One work-around idea I had considered late last night was to simply remove the radar objects from all enemy units and maintain radars only on the player objects, which have a very small maximum unit count; from there, passing contact information to an enemy that the player detects might effectually act the same as having individual radars on large numbers of enemies."

Unity2D,33g8x6,pastarific,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"Whoops, typo sorry.  The IsTrigger is on the child's collider, which was being used as the detection mechanism to identify mainbody colliders of their enemies that enter the radius.   In total, each enemy has 2 circle colliders and two rigidbodies; one circle/rigid is on the child object, and others are on the parent.    I've been slowly working through isolating where the intense CPU usage is originating, and it appears to not be related to the child's radar specifically; the game still runs at 150-200 fps with 100 units spawned and with their child objects CircleCollider2D + Rigidbody2D and the accompanying radar script activated.  Moving the player unit across the threshold of the enemy radar colliders causes a barely noticable hang and drops the average fps to around 120 if you continually move across the threshold.  The enormous CPU usage appears to originate from somewhere other than the radar children, which was surprising to me.  If I can't isolate it in a better way, I'll either try just using a player unit's radar as the sole detection method for both the players and the enemies, and pass detection information to any enemy in range, or set up a way to temporarily disable most child radar operations when a large group of enemy units is in the same region, and have one enemy set as the leader unit to do all object detection."

Unity2D,33h3dr,jabroni33,2,Wed Apr 22 19:23:01 2015 UTC,"It's scale, not size that matters. What you don't want to have to do in Unity is arbitrarily scale things. When I draw my sprites I make sure the in the exported artwork everything is exactly scaled in reference to everything else. This way when I import them into Unity, if the player sprite is too big or too small, I can resize that and whatever value I resize by will be the exact same values for every other sprite. So if the player is too large and I scale him down from 1 to .5, every other object in the game will also now need to be scaled by the same .5. In the past you would have no choice what size to make the sprites in; 32x32 or 16x16 commonly. Since we don't have those limitations anymore you can make them any size you want within reason. There are memory concerns that come into play for games that are extremely sprite intense where you will stick to specific sizes to best utilize the memory, but you'll likely never encounter that unless you are working on something really large.  For pixel, 8-bit style art it's usually customary to scale the camera thus making the sprites look larger than it's original size. But for other styles of art it's usually better to design slightly larger than you intend to display it. I've been working with 64x64 sized sprites lately but scaling the camera to make it look smaller. I just like the way it lends a crispness to the art, though this varies between art styles and isn't a one-size-fits-all rule."

When trying to transition it into some kind of real light source, I unaware of how to handle sprite transparency issues.   If shaders are the proper solution, I'm willing to learn the language. If they aren't, it's going take me months to really learn them, and if they end up not being applicable for this purpose of selectively applying it to numerous multilayered sprites with lots of transparency.

If it's possible to convert this layered texture into a real light that would respect the sprite transparency that might be feasible. I've been reading about light cookies, but I'm not sure how they respect transparency and if they would shine through the gaps.  Currently, if the foreground element and background element are on the same block, one or the other would receive the wrong light block. If a character's foot is over the sky for example, the foot would need to be dark and the sky would need to be light."

Art is cohesive and pretty cute The main mechanic is fun and feels good   Cons:    You keep asking me for Google Play login even after I decline. I had to stop playing the game because it re-asked me after every round. You don't save the sound setting between rounds Some obstacles, namely the buildings with TNT strapped to them, move way too quickly for me to react. I may just be a bad player, but I had no trouble with any of the enemy fighters/UFOs, but constantly crashed into buildings. Initially, I couldn't tell if I had to avoid the buildings in the background. The parallax helped, but they are a little too close in color to the harmful buildings. I suggest adding more contrast between the foreground and background buildings."

Unity2D,339jbj,Abysinian,3,Mon Apr 20 18:56:59 2015 UTC,"Just some quick thoughts:   For the random movement, find a random point +-x from position, set velocity and check in update if the unit is close enough to the position for it to mark the position as reached. To prevent them from walking off you could create a raycast straight down just in front them and see if it hits ground. If it doesn't, turn and mark position as reached. For the player, set the point at the player position and start a countdown timer after which the point is random (or nothing) again."

Also: I did make a backup of the original and tried copying it in; didn't work. Anyway, since the scripts were all saved as prefabs to start with, I just found the spots where the scripts needed to go and I'm back to where I was when I started, and I've learned something in the process."

For example, say you want to move all the files to a new folder: You can simply do CTRL + A to select them all, then hold CTRL and click the new ""main"" folder to de-select it. Holding CTRL will deselect an item that is selected.  Or, if I need a sub-section of ordered files, I'd just select one file, then click the last file in ordered list while holding SHIFT. This will select the first file, the last file, and all the files in between.  If using thumbnail view in Windows and you need to select files that you can't draw a perfect selection box around, that's where the SHIFT selection method works best and even BETTER then the selection box.  It's always good practice either way to know how to navigate around Windows without a mouse: I don't think most users know that you can pretty much access every bit of windows without it [mouse]."

Back to the menu thing though: As a potential player of your game, I'm telling you it's kinda a big deal to me.   You don't have to act on my opinion, but just saying that when you get a comment about your game, ui, mechanic, or whatever, you should really take the time to consider if the person giving you the feedback is just being a dick or wants to see your game become better.

I'm not honestly on the ""bandwagon"" so to speak (I've apparently been mostly doing things in an Agile way inherently apparently), but there are still some nice guiding principles one can take from it.  I say all that Agile stuff, because honestly I think making a grand big plan/storyboard is kinda silly, ESPECIALLY if you are just a two-person shop.  Use Trello, and start smaller. Define your core mechanics first, and start working on that before making grandiose plans. If this is going to be your first foray into not only a RELEASED product, but a 2D MMO at that, then you should honestly be working on creating the core mechanics of movement, interaction, and network connections.  For instance, you should really just start with like an ""Onion Knight"" or ""Warrior"" type character. You would define how he moves and interacts with the world, and give him a basic world to do so in. Then start setting up how your networking will work: This way, your merchanic code isn't huge, making it easier to diagnose network issues. Once you have a good ""core"" in place, THEN start to build out things: stats, story, magic, etc etc etc  ""Story-boards"" and mind-maps just lead to feature creep. A Trello board run in a KanBan config would be much better.  Personal opinion."

It turned out that because we had a script that rotates the object based on mouse location, that forced rotation combined with the angular force that was applied due to the collision, resulted in the angular force being turned into the small velocity that caused the sliding.  We fixed that problem by turning on fixed angle, since that makes sure that no angular forces can be applied (As far as I know).   TL:DR: Make sure you don't have an angular force that somehow gets turned into a velocity, we ran into that and it was a bit difficult to realize what happened."

Unity2D,333kon,Hiphopopotamus5782,2,Sun Apr 19 04:43:54 2015 UTC,You want to use Input.GetKeyDown instead of GetKey. GetKey will return true for every frame while the button is held down. From the manual (GetKey):   Returns true while the user holds down the key identified by name. Think auto fire.   So what is happening is your value is being incremented once on every frame and you are getting an even/odd value (pretty much at random) based on how many frames you have the key pressed down. GetKeyDown will only return true on the next frame after the button is pressed and false after that until it is pressed again. You only want your value to increment once.
Unity2D,333kon,iamallamaa,2,Sun Apr 19 04:57:03 2015 UTC,"Never mind. I figured it out.

I'll just keep on it, there's just so little documentation with Aaron's astar project in regards to the 2D system. I think I might be able to modify the movement scripts that came with the free version but it's just going to take some time.

I'd love to know how to do what I want to do from the ground up, it just might take a while. Making this game has become a real hobby so I don't see myself giving up on it any time soon. I think I started around five or six months ago with really basic stuff, programming wise, and trying to develop a framework of what I want to accomplish and polishing pixel art style and what-not from then to now. I'm pretty happy with how things are shaping up but I suppose it's about time to go back to the basics and get the main gameplay functions in check.   Again thank you so much for the help and info.

Unity2D,33087e,SilentSin26,1 point,Sat Apr 18 06:42:09 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate on the first point? Our two scripts deals with a list of different words. Object 1 deals with the first set, object 2 with the second set, object 3 with the third, etc (we will be adding more objects in the future). These words are also numbered 0 through x (x being the last word in the set of the last object in our editor). Specifically our problem is that object 2 (we currently are working with just 2 objects) starts the beginning of this count. The first word in object 2 is 0; instead we want object 1's first word to be 0. The way we are numbering the words is by joining all the sets into a master list. But because object 2's script runs before object 1's, object 2's words are in the beginning of the list."

Unity2D,32yotp,gamesplusjames,2,Fri Apr 17 20:33:30 2015 UTC,"Nice tutorial! I just have one little nitpick with your use of Mathf.Round.  Since you're displaying a seconds timer, for clarity purposes each number should be displayed for the same amount of time as it counts down. However, because of how normal rounding works, the 0 is only displayed for half a second before killing the player, while all other numbers are displayed for a full 1 second before counting down the next number. This can be alleviated by instead using Mathf.Ceil or Mathf.Floor to always round up or down respectively, depending on whether you want the timer to kill the player immediately upon reaching 0 or to display the 0 and then kill the player upon reaching -1 (again, respectively). Also, simply casting the variable to an integer will accomplish mostly the same thing as Mathf.Floor, provided the timer is only ever postive and never so absurdly large that it won't fit in an int (the only difference will be that if you pause the game or something on death, say to play an animation, the timer will display -1 on Mathf.Floor and 0 for an int cast, but it will still happen 1 second after changing from 1 to 0).  That's not a big deal at all, just something I felt was worth mentioning."
Unity2D,32yotp,Zarokima,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:27:17 2015 UTC,"If you were going to use a timer more complex than this, it'd probably be easier to just use a formatted string and just not include milliseconds; it'd fix the problem and let you format things in standard time format!

Unity2D,32yotp,MeltedTwix,1 point,Sat Apr 18 06:16:32 2015 UTC,"Mathf.Floor always rounds down, while casting to an int rounds toward zero. So while the variable is positive, an int cast acts like Mathf.Floor, but when negative it acts like Mathf.Ceil. Also, float has a higher range than int so if it's too big (negative or positive) you'll have issues there. Definitely safer to just use one of the rounding functions."

How do we know that the issue isn't the raycast, but actually the part of the code drawing the line/blue-square?  From a personal standpoint, you can use the transform.position instead of specifying the axis for your Raycast. So you don't need to do ""new vector2(x,y)"", just do ""Raycast(parentPosition.position, PlayerRef.transform.position"".  Additionally, you should be casting the ray from a sort of ""gun tip"" of the turret: You're going to be instantiating projectiles from a ""tip"" position/object ANYWAYS, and using that as the origin point instead of parentPosition would mitigate issues with the raycast touching the turret's own collider.  Next up, I'd really recommend limiting the distance of ray... Personally, especially if using Unity physics, I would set a large circular trigger collider around the turret, and use OnTriggerStay2D to begin the next set of checks.  The next set of checks (within OnTriggerStay2D) would determine the angle simply by using Vector2.Angle, [example]. If the player is within the angle AND the trigger, only then would you shoot a raycast.  You can also leave out the math.infinity stuff. Not required generally."

If so, wouldn't it be better to just use:  Vector2.Distance(turret.transform.position, player.transform.position)  (Distance between A and B)  If you could try changing that first and see what happens, that would be nice. Because frankly, I have no idea why you are doing sqrt and pow, unless the distance between them is not what you are looking for (Even though it seems it is). If it doesn't help, then the problem could be in the way that you find your positions (Why is it parentPosition.position? Makes it sound like you have some odd object to determine position, when gameObject.transform.position should work fine)."

The answer to not knowing the source of the problem is always more debug in the right place. Draw a debug ray using the origin and destination of the raycast at all times, not just when it sees the player. Do it with Debug.DrawRay right before or after the raycast, not in OnDrawGizmo to make sure that you're catching any behavior caused by other scripts interfering during the FixedUpdate or something.

The 0's are spots where you tell your game manager to NOT spawn ""gems"" or ""candies"", and the 1's are spots where they CAN be spawned.

If I know the area north goes into a mine/cave, I would use a cliff from the bottom perspective in this direction. Very simple and I can add images that hide some of the cliff wall itself. The direction to the east could be towards a lake as most caves that have been mined out are near a water source.

Unity2D,32t6yi,Kinths,4,Thu Apr 16 14:54:34 2015 UTC,"The more objects you have in your game, the ""larger"" the performance hit.  How ""large"" of a performance hit really depends on one other question: ""Does it really matter?"".   You are increasing the count of one of the most basic things in Unity: The object count. I would say that you could safely have ~1000 tiles in your game and not notice a decrease in FPS on almost any modern mobile device.  If you're still prototyping though, forget about optimization and performance. You should keep your target platform in MIND, but it should not be the FOCUS until you have fleshed out all your core mechanics in game.  For a more granular reply: Work on using separate objects for your tiles and generate ~4 rooms/areas/whatever. Work within that restriction until you have fleshed out all the OTHER parts of your game: Actions, movement, scene changes, maybe even some basic UI. If your game mechanics or idea hasn't changed a whole ton by that point, you can proceed to generate MORE rooms, getting closer to your final product. Only when you DO start noticing performance bottlenecks, then begin to look at what can be fixed/optimized, like combining generated tiles into a single mesh object/texture, fixing up poorly looped code, etc.  Ultimately this is a better approach for most games: Almost any aspect of your game may change as you continually develop your game: A system you spent weeks on creating might be scrapped the following week because a ""super awesome cool idea"" you had turned out to not be as great as you once thought."
Unity2D,32t6yi,kreaol,2,Thu Apr 16 16:09:50 2015 UTC,"There is a soft upper limit to the number of game objects that can be in game. Usually limited by the performance of the computer. Every gameObject has some component. And every component could have a start, update, fixedUpdate...etc methods. These get called every frame. So even while there maybe little to nothing going on, having to call tons of update functions every frame will have some overhead. Now you can have quite a lot of game objects before this becomes an issue, so it is very likely not an issue at all. The only way to know for sure is to try it. After all, premature optimization is the root of all evil. And that is likely what this is."

Normally I'd recommend to consolidate as much as possible however, since you want to do random generation, you'll need to have smaller set pieces to use. Try making them as big as possible but your design necessitates multiple game objects.   Now here's the part I'm not entirely sure about, draw calls. If you can get it so all your tiles load in a single draw call, I don't think you'll have have performance impact vs. just using a single large object in a single draw call. But you'll have to do more research to verify if what I said is accurate. I'm still learning about draw calls myself."

As soon as we release Unity 5, the WebGL tools will be available to free users as well.   The Unity 5 page sounds like it's not ready and I don't remember any news about WebGL:   A preview of the new deployment support for advanced 3D and 2D content in browsers.   However, there is this article from Mozilla about One Click WebGL Export in Unity. I wonder if it really works so easily...  I imagine the reason Google's starting to be a dick about it is that they announced this 1.5 years ago. Hell, they started blocking NPAPI plugins in January 2014, but Unity got an exception.

Google's explanation:   NPAPI’s 90s-era architecture has become a leading cause of hangs, crashes, security incidents, and code complexity.    Maintaining software isn't free. As a programmer, I can empathize with not wanting to support a whole system just for one client with no benefit to 90% of your users.   you seem to think ""do this, or die"" is equivalent to 'incentive'   Not dying is a strong incentive. I don't see how anyone could disagree.   What's effective about it   Do you doubt that blocking NPAPI plugins will end the use of NPAPI plugins? It will be effective and ending NPAPI use in Chrome, but it could have the unwanted side effect of reducing Chrome's marketshare (especially since Mozilla's current stance is click-to-play and discouragement).   Last i checked, Netflix uses Silverlight   Netflix already supports HTML5 video playback and they talked about this years ago.  You seem to think I'm happy with this decision. I'm not; I'm just providing a rationale for why it happened.  Microsoft announced the death of Silverlight in 2012, but they're still supporting it until 2021. That's an easy timeframe for people to shift to alternative technologies (as demonstrated by Netflix). Of course it's a different situation since there are no real alternatives to Silverlight, whereas with NPAPI you can switch to Firefox or IE. Regardless, if they didn't share their roadmap/timeline with those top 10 plugin developers then they're really being dicks. And 1.5 years isn't very much time to develop and polish a new platform target."

I can understand Google's, and other browser developers' reasoning: plugins are dangerous, create added code complexity, and most of all... tend to be buggy. Those issues make their browsers look bad even though they didn't even develop the plugins. It's just not a great solution given that HTML 5 solves, or soon will solve, many of the multimedia functions those plugins provided.  My big issue with this is that it was a surprise, I think. I work with a company that makes its money on people running our Unity player (not a game). These are not coworkers that we can easily educate, they're random people on the web. We are working on a solution for this, but it isn't ready yet. We now have to presume all Chrome users (40% for us!) cannot or will not use our software."

Unity2D,32o8a1,iamallamaa,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:48:58 2015 UTC,Why not just make the item a child of the camera. Then if/when the camera moves it will move along too. The camera is just another gameObject with components so you can add whatever you want to it including other scripts/components and children.

Unity2D,32njit,Pure_Life1,2,Wed Apr 15 05:19:36 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple actually, just have to think about it a different way.  The quick dirty way (to get used to it) is to create an object for the menu and attach it anywhere on your object with a canvas. Then, create a function with an if else statement (which will be the toggle), which the whole thing looks like this:  using UnityEngine;  public class inGameUI : MonoBehaviour {  public GameObject OptionsMenu;   public void ToggleOptionsMenu(){      if(Time.timeScale == 1 && OptionsMenu.GetActive()){          OptionsMenu.SetActive(false);          Time.timeScale = 0;      } else {          OptionsMenu.SetActive(true);          Time.timeScale = 1;      }  }   }  ^ Then, create a button object and assign this script to the onClick(), right in the GUI.   Nice and simple, hope it helps put you on the right road!"

You should only need to do OptionsMenu.isActiveAndEnabled, which requires using UnityEngine.Internal;.  Realistically though, you can do flip it based off of the time interval, or you can setup a flag to track if game is paused or not.  Sorry about that again."

Unity2D,32mdyd,hamtreble,2,Tue Apr 14 23:16:19 2015 UTC,"Some suggestions. You don't need colliders for walking under the bridge if you just disable the wall colliders by default and only enable them when the user hits the triggers at edges of upper bridge. Also, I would add a trigger for the whole bridge. Then you can tell when someone is on/under the bridge. When they leave the bridge trigger, you can disable the colliders again. Don't rely on a trigger before and after the bridge to enable/disable because nothing would stop someone from hitting the trigger and going back. Also, this allows you to do stuff like make the bridge transparent when under."

I can tell you that you of course can't just dump your cocos2d-x code (which is C++ as far as I remember) into Unity and expect it to work, but if you understand the syntax and language differences you should be able to read the C++ and gather what it is doing and write the equivalent C# code to do the same thing. One thing that might get you is that the cocos2d-x game might not have been using a component pattern, whereas with Unity3D it makes sense to do this, so you might have a ton of polymorphism in the game code to trawl through and get working in Unity (not that you can't do that of course, because you can, but I guess what I am saying is that I've found that in a lot of cases it doesn't make sense to use class inheritance with Unity, and is way easier to just use the Monobehaviour and go with that)."

I made a public void moveLeft() and public void moveRight() on my player control script (attached to my player object/prefab) and inside of it, I put in my movement forces. The same code you would put on Input.GetKey(KeyCode.A).  And then I made a button on the UI Canvas and removed the image script component. This will disable the button, for now, but don't fear. Change the size to what you want and attach an Event Trigger. Add a Pointer Click to the Event Trigger, attach your Player Control script and set it to Pointer Click.

Unity2D,32c4gg,ricewarrior21,11,Sun Apr 12 15:33:56 2015 UTC,Unity.  It's a perspective trick using 3D Quads and shaders with a pragma added to them that allows full forward shadows.  It looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/isQsago.jpg
Unity2D,32c4gg,ricewarrior21,3,Sun Apr 12 15:41:27 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by pragma? Did you have to add something to the shader to make the shadows appear? It seems like if you're using the 3D system for lighting you wouldn't need any custom shaders to have shadows. I'm not too familiar with shaders :S  Looks great btw, love the result!"
Unity2D,32c4gg,ricewarrior21,3,Sun Apr 12 17:13:29 2015 UTC,In unity there are different styles of rendering.   The 2 main ones are deferred and Forward.  If you are building a 2D Game (even a faux 2d game such as mine) you will most likely be using the orthographic camera. Unity's orthographic camera only supports Forward rendering. The problem here is that many of Unity's default shaders don't support shadows in forward rendering. This includes all shaders that have a diffuse element to them. If you just use the standard shader you will get shadows but things are fairly glossy and horrible and it's not a nice effect.   Unity has a Pragma that adds this support in (No idea why it's not there to begin with). https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x74w198a.aspx
Unity2D,32c4gg,Scellow,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"I was bored and gave something similar to your scene a shot with the standard shaders, and you're definitely right that there is a glossiness over parts that look pretty bad.

I'm using Unity 5 and it seems like I didn't have any issues with shadows showing up with an orthographic camera.  http://i.imgur.com/tmnb57G.png  Also, there are lines between my meshes, which is a bit strange, not sure how to fix that"
Unity2D,32c4gg,TheWarPelican,2,Sun Apr 12 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"Switch to any shader that uses diffuse (which I want because it gives a nice effect on the colours) and it shouldn't render the shadows any more (unless your camera is set to Deferred at which point it will auto switch to forward when you run the game).  Normal maps wont solve the issue on my style of art. You can use normals on pixel art (and I have added them since I took this screenshot) but they have to be very sutble otherwise they have some really odd effects). I also still wouldn't have diffuse. Adding the Pragma was easy enough.   As for the edges, are you using a Sprite sheet?"
Unity2D,32c4gg,CopperHook,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:24:05 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, I see the issue now. My camera wasn't set properly when using the diffuse shader so it kept changing to deferred, so the lighting was still showing up in the scene view.  It definitely looks like  your pixel art style fits better with the diffuselighting, but since there's a lot of normal map emphasis with the tiles I'm using, the standard shader seems to look fine for me (at least imo). Also, the edges were a mistake on my part, the quads I were using had a weird scale and Unity's auto snap didn't align them properly :X  Anyways, thanks for all the information, great work on your art so far!  You have a twitter or anything I could follow to stay updated?"
Unity2D,32c4gg,TheWarPelican,2,Mon Apr 13 01:26:23 2015 UTC,Ahh glad you managed to sort it.  As for twitter I haven't thought that far ahead to be honest. I only started developing games about a month a go. I should probably get something set up soon.

Unity2D,32dc9r,kreaol,2,Mon Apr 13 00:36:41 2015 UTC,Easily doable with unity. There's a lot of ways you could do it. The old Immediate mode gui is kinda slow but would be very easy way to do this. Or the new uGUI would allow for something a lot more performant and pretty but would take more time.   You'll have to do some homework on it due to how many ways it could be done but short answer: yes
Unity2D,32dc9r,Wisteso,2,Mon Apr 13 00:37:38 2015 UTC,"Sure! If you code it in C#, I can recommend System.Text.RegularExpressions for all the RegEx your heart desires to parse the player input, but for a basic command line input, you can just get what the player types with foreach(char c in Input.inputString) string inputs += c; etc. and then use string inputs for a Gui.text object, and match inputs with if (inputs == ""dir"") in order to get the commands, etc. (this might not be the best way, but it's an easy one that will work)"

Unity2D,32ctz3,Horev,2,Sun Apr 12 18:41:25 2015 UTC,"I think the smarter idea would be to utilize the component that unity devs created just for these situations. Take a look at the ScriptedObject class and find a helper script that allows you to create .asset files for serializing a ScriptedObject.  The other solutions are fine too but ScriptedObjects are going to be the natural unity way to do it, and it won't require having programmers to do what your game designers should be doing. It can all be done in the editor."

Unity2D,32ctz3,OnAStick,1 point,Sun Apr 12 20:53:03 2015 UTC,You can either use unity's playerPrefs or preferably create your own files by serializing data into a binary format. I believe playerPrefs saves your data into a txt file that can easily be accessed and rewritten.
Unity2D,32ctz3,OnAStick,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:24:10 2015 UTC,"How do I manage that data with classes for easy access after I deserialize it from file? If I make a list of ""Weapon"" classes for example, I would need to search through every class in the list to get the name of the weapon each time I wanted to access its properties. Can you suggest a better way to do it?"
Unity2D,32ctz3,Wisteso,2,Sun Apr 12 19:57:13 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of ways to do that. If you want to use a List consider using the hierarchy and apply some form of inheritance to your class.  Inventory(Slot, Bag), Type(Armor,Weapons), then Item(Name, Description) being the bottom.  When you load a players save, load and cache the inventory list in a controller as well. Populate your inventory at this time using basic LINQ operations. If you are unfamiliar with LINQ add the name space at the top of your class  using System.Linq;"

Unity2D,329imx,ricewarrior21,2,Sat Apr 11 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"Camera is perspective. The background is entirely 2D, mountains, clouds, sky, stars.   Lighting(light color, intensity, direction etc) is controlled by a single directional light paired with a script which rotates on a plane.   The fort and the bridge are modeled in SketchUp and the shaders used are the unity default toon shaders.  By any chance, do you do character design?"

Unity2D,329imx,mcmustang51,2,Sat Apr 11 21:20:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate ;) I'm quite new to Unity. Sadly I haven't had the time to write up on the results of my experimentation yet. Feel free to PM me if you want more explanation on how I achieved the aesthetic. In general, The first thing I set up was a rotating sky plane with a directional light source attached. I then wrote a script to keep track of time, and update the light direction, color and intensity accordingly. I used the default unity toon shader for all the models in my project."
Unity2D,32a597,kylerk,8,Sat Apr 11 23:47:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know your game, so i could be wrong. But seems to me that some of those animations could be inside blend trees. Like, you would have a transition from Idle to Lookup, but lookup would be a blendtree that would handle if it is ""lookup_goingup"", ""lookup"" or ""lookup_goingdown"". The same with that crouch sequence. I believe this way you could tidy up a bit the transitions.  But as i said, i don't know your game. For instance i don't understand why the lookups and the crouchs have a sequence that starts and ends at Idle."
Unity2D,32a597,TitoOliveira,3,Sun Apr 12 06:51:41 2015 UTC,"Came to say this. Blend trees are super shit loads handy and the specific animation can be played depending in a factor you set up; eg: if you are just after starting to fall your '-acceleration will be between - 0.01 and - 0.1' can play an animated series of events.   Unity win!   Also,  can we see these in action on ur character plz? Intrigued as you have obvs put alot of work into this."
