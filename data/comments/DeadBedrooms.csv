DeadBedrooms,3e2zhw,Dr_Harden_Thicke_MD,9,Tue Jul 21 15:46:32 2015 UTC,Good for you!  I'm so happy for both of you!    Relationships are hard work.  Trust is hard work.  Communication is hard work.  There must be a lot of love between the two of you for this to have worked.    Here's to your continued relationship success!  Yay!

DeadBedrooms,3e2zhw,LyssaBrisby,4,Tue Jul 21 17:33:45 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness! Before you go for surgery, look into pelvic floor physiotherapy. This is EXACTLY their wheelhouse. I had nerve damage after the birth of my third child, and pain during intercourse and incontinence is the #1 area of expertise for pelvic floor physiotherapy - they had me sorted in a mere handful of visits. There could be a much less invasive, and less painful, method of treatment available to her - and they would also have the expertise to help determine a more drastic course of treatment if it is truly warranted.  My heart goes out to you both (and to your poor wife's junk)! I hope you look into this!"
DeadBedrooms,3e2zhw,dca_member,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:06 2015 UTC,Thank you for this advice - I'll definitely look into this.

DeadBedrooms,3e2zhw,cincofone,4,Tue Jul 21 16:33:16 2015 UTC,"She knows - but due to her upbringing opening up is really really difficult.  I guess she just figured I'd always stay because of the kids.  With them close to being out the door, and me recently hitting the gym maybe she realized how precarious our situation really is?

You beat off.  Your wife can either obviate your need to do so (see: a functional physical relationship) or she can fucking deal with it, the same way you've had to fucking deal with no fucking."
DeadBedrooms,3e3okl,ChimpsRFullOfScience,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:53:11 2015 UTC,"We're all so ready to condemn cheaters...as evidence with the recent Ashly-Madison stuff. It strikes me as odd given the level of self loathing here on this sub that people aren't happy that someone found a way to be happy. In some situations, cheating is the least shitty option. For those of you that need convincing, please see Dan Savage...    As for your situation, the determination to wait out the kids will eventually fall to pieces unless that's pretty near. Eventually you'll leave, cheat, or just be a shitty partner until its your fault and she wants you to leave.    I seem to give the same advice a lot. If you've put in the work to get her on board with making it work and she just doesn't care, give her a time line to get with it or you're cheating or leaving. It'll work or you'll part ways and you'll both be better off, both good outcomes. Becoming an angry shitty person because you were forced into celibacy won't do your kids any good.    My advice comes from experience. My wife finding out that I had a short fling saved my marriage, and she admits it and is happy it happened. I tried everything, but that's what it took to snap her out of it. Does it suck that it took the extreme to snap her out of it and realize that she wanted to keep what we had? Yep, but in the end it was better than divorce. That shitty incident forced us both to really admit what we want out of a partner. We both changed to tame the beast and now sex is often and good for us both.    Now the disclaimer: every relationship is different, YMMV, and most spouses won't react that way to cheating, so don't go for that option unless you're ready to be caught and end the relationship.    good luck."
DeadBedrooms,3e3okl,mysexrdtaccouint2014,4,Tue Jul 21 19:23:08 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your frustration but I'll make the same declaration I normally do on my race to a negative score. If you become an angry shitty person that's on you.  I understand that celibacy sucks but no one makes you take that shit out on anyone else, least of all your kids.  You, and only you are responsible for your actions."
DeadBedrooms,3e3okl,gregnegative,2,Tue Jul 21 21:01:00 2015 UTC,"given the level of self loathing here on this sub    Can't you see that this is the very problem that guarantees rejection at home? It's the absolute dependence on the denying partner which pushes them farther away. It's not the old ""it's my body and I'll do as I please"" routine that everyone here trots out, it's  ""I'm not responsible for the constant care and upkeep of your fragile ego"" that leads many if not most of them to lose interest.   Sex isn't fun with a dependent, needy person, and the farther down into self-loathing and depression you fall, the less likely your partner is going to jump your bones. It might be true that the lower libido person needs a little medical intervention or a marital wake-up call like a horrendous argument and a storm out, but the seeking partner has got to buck up and take sole responsibility for his or her happiness. No matter what. That person rejecting you does not control you unless you permit that to happen."

Though I suppose if I'm a non-functioning wreck in my relationship...maybe that's not as selfish as it sounds. I just know I can never take it back once I say it and I'm afraid to take the plunge and break his heart. I keep hoping I can get my shit together on my own....that hasn't happened yet though..."

We may not be able to impact what goes on in another person's (our SO's) world, but I can say that the good folks on this sub have helped ME (as a lurker and with my own post today) grow and learn things that impact my world at least.

Two men are on a golf course and one of them is complaining to the other.  He says:   When I was in jr. high, all I wanted was a girl with big tits.  In high school, I dated a girl with big tits, but there was no passion. So I decided I needed a passionate girl.  In college, I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency, she cried all the time. So I decided I needed a girl with some stability.  I found a very stable girl, but she was boring. She never got excited about anything. So I decided I needed a girl withsome excitement.  I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She was directionless. So I decided to find a girl with some ambition.  After college, I found an ambitious girl and married her. She was so ambitious, she divorced me and took everything I owned.  Now all I want is a girl with big tits."

I don't know your circumstances in your marriage, but I know routine rejection. It makes you crazy and after so long it makes you do crazy things. I don't know why this guy used you, but I do know that if I went that route, no matter how I thought I would not get emotionally invested, it's hard not too.. Whether or not it's right or wrong is moot, it's what to do now, know that you are going to be OK, you feel like crap but find a person you can trust and confess. Just the act of getting it off your chest can help. I don't know if your husband is the LL or your relationship dynamic makes intimacy non functional, but if you want to stay it looks like you will have to move on in your heart. I wish we all here could recognize that we all would be in your boat if the chance arose, but know that you aren't alone.

DeadBedrooms,3e2b22,camdenhoaker,3,Tue Jul 21 13:56:36 2015 UTC,Thank you so much kind stranger. This really means a lot. I never thought I would become this person. The path seems so clear until you're actually walking it. Life can really throw you some curves. I just wish I had handled it better. :(
DeadBedrooms,3e2b22,camdenhoaker,2,Tue Jul 21 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"Hind sight is 20/20, it's never easy. I tell myself all the time that your situation would be one I would never face, but I don't know what tomorrow will bring so I don't know what would happen. I think that even though you thought your feelings were being separate, you got tied up and confused your current love for your SO with your AP. Yeah that guy was a d-bag and took advantage, but just know that it's done and now go forward. I'm sorry you are having a hard time but it will pass. The only advice I would give is to evaluate your marriage, and see that what happened is a product of the physicality it was lacking. Ultimately you live with a good roommate, you both could choose to live together from here on out but know that this problem won't go away and the sexual dynamic is going to make you always want more. My heart goes out to you and I'm sorry you are having a bad time. It sucks but it will be ok."
DeadBedrooms,3e2b22,camdenhoaker,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:34 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. The support and compassion I've received on this sub is better than I have any right to expect.   I tell myself all the time that your situation would be one I would never face   I always thought the same thing...I've been sexually frustrated for a long time but never even really wanted to cheat before this guy made it his personal project to wear me down. It came out of nowhere and hit me like a ton of bricks. I was ill-prepared to handle it and I fucked it up royally.
DeadBedrooms,3e2b22,camdenhoaker,2,Tue Jul 21 14:34:42 2015 UTC,"that's the thing, i don't think you could ever prepare enough. there is nothing that you could do to practice. its not like you could have practice sessions, its just something no one could ever face until it is in your face. i think that even though i have been through a relationship where my first cheated on me, i still identify with what you are saying and know that the test of ""what would i do"" can never be really answered. no matter what people say in this sub, all of us wants to be wanted. to have rejection given out so readily by someone we love is true mental anguish and abuse. i don't know where you are or what your marriage is like, but i really feel for you.  but can i ask how did you eff it up, if you just had the sex? did he tell everyone at work or take pics or post something?"
DeadBedrooms,3e2b22,grinningbeer,2,Tue Jul 21 14:47:36 2015 UTC,"We met up twice outside of work. The first time I refused to do more than make out. The second time (a month later and much deeper in) I went down on him on the promise that he'd return the favor once we had a better location for it. That promise was shit, he lost interest after that.   I don't know for sure but I do believe he probably told at least one guy at work. But let's be honest. Everyone in the office knows SOMETHING is up when shit like that goes down. I left the job.  The reason I say I fucked it up is because I wish I had stayed true to my partner. The part of me that is my worst self wishes I had at least gotten off once if I was going to cheat. But really it doesn't matter; I'd still be guilty and depressed if I had, just with less of a side of impotent rage. It serves me right that the whole thing was a waste and I got nothing but heartache and guilt out of it. Seems appropriate given my betrayal."
DeadBedrooms,3e2b22,DrLicktenpien,2,Tue Jul 21 15:34:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah that would suck, and yeah you have a right to be mad at that guy. But it could be worse, you could have had full blown sex and I think you would have had more guilt from that. I see what you are saying though, you broke the trust or a section of trust in your marriage. But, the deeper problem is that your marriage is broken, as is many of all ours in this sub. The partner refuses to love you the same as you love them and that is the running joke here we love someone who doesn't love us the same way. My first marriage was like that and this marriage is the same but with zero sex. I know my wife loves me as a ""husband"" but not romantically. So we are all stuck in this rut of being ok with it, you just had a moment where something physical happened, it just wasn't what you needed. I hope you don't spiral out of control, really you aren't a bad person just someone who just wanted a form of love. Yeah I can sit here and anonymously type these words but my heart really goes out to you. It's going to be ok."

The most constructive thing you can do right now is put this behind you and throw yourself into a project that will add value to your life. Do you have any special talents or interests? Any particular charitable cause you could volunteer for? Do you have any health issues you could tackle, or do you need to work more exercise into your daily routine? What positive tasks can you take on that will occupy ypur mind and improve your life?   I'm not making these suggestions because I think you lack discipline, I just want you to know that I agree that adding another shit relationship to a life that already has a relationship problem is a huge mistake.

DeadBedrooms,3e2b22,gregnegative,2,Tue Jul 21 13:23:47 2015 UTC,Self-loathing can be very motivating. Go to the gym and really push yourself (research first if you're new to exercise - /r/fitness is a good place to start).  It will distract you and make you feel better physically and mentally.
DeadBedrooms,3e2b22,incognito_dk,2,Tue Jul 21 18:37:06 2015 UTC,Self-loathing can be very motivating.   I hope I find this to be the case at some point; for me it's been quite the opposite. I'm pretty depressed and don't even want to get out of bed in the morning some days. The pressure of acting cheerful and normal for my husband/my job while I'm dying inside really weighs on me. Other days I'm closer to okay. Not sure why it's different on different days but overall I have been able to find less pleasure in the things I used to enjoy and I'm not motivated to want the things I used to want.
DeadBedrooms,3e2b22,FallenNgel,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe counseling or medication? Even if its episodic, depression can be tough to deal with and can be self-reinforcing.  It helped me a lot to keep busy even if all I wanted to do was lay in bed.  The feeling less pleasure and disengaged is also part of it - like nothing really matters.    It will get better, even if it doesn't seem like it now."

In my fantasy this person becomes a great support to me in all if my DB stress, but this is an excellent warning that you can never judge the motivations if your partner perfectly in this kind of situation.  As I thought about this route, I did find a friend (of the opposite sex) with whom I email daily and talk about our DB situations (she's in one too). We've each put some safeguards in place to ensure we can't be tempted. I've found it to be very helpful, getting some (but not all!) of the emotional support I need without doing anything that makes me feel guilty. (Don't get me wrong, if my wife knew I had this friend and read all our emails, she'd be livid. But it doesn't make me feel guilty and the resulting drama would not destroy our marriage... which I've made a conscious decision to stay in for the kids.)"

I never wanted to cheat...after a long period of resistance and telling myself I wouldn't let it get too far, at a certain point I found I couldn't stop myself. And now that I've had the thrill of the affair, even as disgusting as it seems now, it just highlights the dullness of my marital sexual relationship...sooooo in short, everything looks worse in just about every way possible, thus my current depression.  It's good that you've put safeguards in place...just be careful. It does sound like you're at least talking to someone who hopefully won't screw you over without remorse...not sure if that's better or worse...hah."
DeadBedrooms,3e2b22,Redshoe9,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:32 2015 UTC,"When someone shows an interest in you who you find attractive its really powerful when you don't get that kind of attention at home.  The ""email flirting"" I mention, I passed up on that ""opportunity"" for reasons not worth getting into here, but after having had the fantasy with someone, I'm left with the reality of a DB and will forever wonder what could have happened with my email partner there if things went differently... Even though I'm glad to still have vows intact.  You can't win no matter what when you feel abandoned in a DB. I'm sorry you've gone through this and even had to change jobs.  If you were my spouse, I'd mostly understand and not want you to feel guilty (and then I'd do my best to make up for his mistake in not reciprocating).

I didn't realize how much stake I'd put in feeling that passion for however short a time I had intended...without that prospect, the reality of my DB is a depressing one to look forward to as much as I love my SO and as relieved as I am that the affair is behind me.   I feel like I have every single emotion around this and it's super confusing. At least I know that deciding to get physical wasn't the stress release I was hoping for. It has just made me feel even shittier. Had I gotten off as promised I doubt it would feel much different...much less angry probably but I still wouldn't be happy by any means.

I wasn't romantically interested in the guy I cheated with but nevertheless I got used so hard by him, I thought he was my friend but he betrayed my trust and that hurts. He has a great sex life at home and just seduces women for funsies because he can; as far as I can tell he's a self-absorbed asshole who skates by on his looks and doesn't respect women.

In most of the 'cases' that come through this sub, the responsibility for the situation lies with both partners (and in some cases just the HL's). It's really never that black and white, making it seem that way, like there are two distinct sides, could be detrimental. Support and advice needs to be case by case, there is no one size fits all. Even with the commonalities."
DeadBedrooms,3e11y9,rarelyamused,6,Tue Jul 21 08:59:00 2015 UTC,"I agree that two sticky posts might be a good idea...  But I think it's interesting that the recommended post for HLs is one of support, while the recommended post for LLs is to look at things from an HL perspective.  I think both need both.  Both need empathy and to be able to look at the situation from their partner's eyes.  There have been some good HL success story posts from partners who acknowledge that they were part of the problem, and being more attentive to their partner's non-sexual needs and being less resentful helped the dead bedroom.  And similarly, LLs should be able to get support from others in a similar boat - others feeling guilt from not fulfilling their partner's needs while still being totally untempted by sex, or too busy/tired to enjoy it regularly.  And then EVERYONE should get links to resources:  books and videos that community members have found helpful, info on how to find a relationship or sex counselor, etc."

It's the reason I still force myself to have sex I don't enjoy and pretend I do. This is not to mention that LL partners are also missing out sexually. It makes me feel really uncomfortable how this sub makes everything about the HL partner, like we're not suffering or we're selfish for not having more sex we really don't want.  Separate stickied posts would be awesome cos hopefully it would open up room for LL discussion that is a little more nuanced than ""gf not putting out, clearly doesn't understand/care about my feelings/needs""."

If you have needs and your partner stops caring about them, you're going to be upset. And you never see anyone bashing an LL who's actually trying.   I also think you have to consider that the HL is the deprived one. The Ll is getting all the sex they want and need while the HL is starving. So they tend to have it worse than the LL who feels bad."
DeadBedrooms,3e11y9,livingthepuglife,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:46 2015 UTC,"So they tend to have it worse than the LL who feels bad.   to clarify, who feels bad mostly just because of empathy for the HL     If you go stickied, might as well have two different subs, one complaining about lack of sex and one complaining about being forced into sex.   It no longer qualifies as a support group then and is just a bitchfest for both sides individually."
DeadBedrooms,3e11y9,BangChooChoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:40 2015 UTC,one complaining about being forced into sex.    No one wants that though. That's why forced sex is so looked down upon here under the name of duty sex. What people want is to be desired and their LL to work on their desire.

DeadBedrooms,3e11y9,BangChooChoo,3,Tue Jul 21 18:21:03 2015 UTC,"I think one for LLs that explains that HLs don't hate LLs would be good. HLs hate apathy. Not LLs. An apathetic LL is something no one would like. Because no one, regardless of their libido, wants to be with someone who doesn't care about their needs. But try-hard people should always feel welcome. So maybe a post to welcome, explain that you aren't hated for being an LL, and we hope you'll keep an open mind.

""  They have to be aware of the threat. Some are oblivious. In your wife's case, she is getting what she wants - A husband that doesn't annoy her with sexual advances anymore. She doesn't miss sex, and doesn't miss what ever advances of yours as well issues her rejections caused. She NOW has everything she wants.  Some will naturally notice the change in their SO and respond. Your wife seems to need a kick in the pants. I suggest you have a very frank discussion with her about your self improvement and the motivation behind it.   I also suggest you consult a divorce attorney. NOW. Best thing you can do is consult one a year + in advance of pulling the plug. Find out what you need to be doing NOW in advance of any official filing.  This is to protect yourself. This is to get things in place for yourself and limit the damage she'll potentially do to you in a divorce. Get ten steps ahead of her now.  It might also be part of your discussion.

I also reiterated that it is a deal breaker and if this continues we will be moving more and more towards a divorce.  After i discussed the above i listed all of the different things i have tried to change to improve things. Then i voiced my concern that my SO isn't trying to improve things. I started to get the excuses again the whole list of non valid excuses. I voiced that its been over a year you've had plenty of time to work on things and nothing has changed.

You are really brave and strong to be facing the after effects and wanting to overcome them.  Yes, a good therapist will be incredibly helpful. I think you would probably benefit most from individual counseling. That's not to say that your boyfriend isn't affected--he is, and it's so loving of you to address your stuff because you see how it's affecting him. But the real healing work is about what's going on with you, and it will be important to prioritize that in your counseling sessions. If he needs support during this time he can find a counselor too.   To find someone who is good at this kind of work in your area, I strongly suggest calling a domestic violence or rape counseling resource, even though this current relationship doesn't sound abusive. They will be able to direct you to people who have expertise in working with survivors of abuse and assault.  Good luck."

Most people here will say that communication is key, but what hurts even more is actually hearing ""I dont know, I'm just not that interested in sex"". That's where I'm at now and I'm just trying to wrap my head around my situation. I'm trying to learn about how sex and the brain works in hope that it will make me understand my SO better and nudge her in the right direction. Here's a link to some interesting stuff that kind of made me think."
DeadBedrooms,3dxn8t,2manypints,5,Mon Jul 20 12:43:50 2015 UTC,"Your story could almost be mine (30F HL). It sounds like as the newness of the relationship has worn off, you're now seeing his natural libido ""default setting"" which is just not very sex-hungry.   It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with either of you--you're at opposite ends of a normal spectrum. What it does mean is that you will both have to work hard and communicate about this issue and both your wants/needs to find an ""overlap"" in terms of what will satisfy you both in terms of sexual frequency.  The above is somewhat easier said than done...my husband (30M LL) and I have gone through periods of greater and lesser success in terms of frequency. And even when you achieve this goal, there can still be issues; I've found that even if the frequency meets my needs, it usually feels like ""obligation sex"" where he does it only because he knows I need it, not because he really wants it...which is (for me) unsatisfying no matter how often it may happen. If it's important to you to feel truly desired in the same way you desire him...well, that's an issue I haven't found a solution for in my own situation.  Long story short, being in a relationship where your sex drives aren't well matched is tough even when your relationship is great. With dedication, patience and open-hearted communication, you can improve things, but this issue is still likely to be one you'll both have to wrestle with for the duration of your time together."

Now I have found this interesting that she is now pregnant and the roles have switched for the first time ever, we've been together for 10 years.  I want it like once a week if not more and she wants it like once a month.   Coming on 8 months pregnant.  Not sure what's going on with that lol, pheromones....?   Interested to see once the baby comes out if I'll stay the same and she will come back to her normal or if we will just go back to how it was.   But again I before was always a few times month with sex and was happy, could do with out it every week. Don't know why really something in the brain and cock not connecting I guess, so it makes me not interested in it as much.  Now when we are making love it's awesome and great! I love it.

Hell its hard just talking about it here. It's a dead bedroom sub but it helps me know how she could be feeling as well as maybe finding more out about myself.  Hence the long time lurker status to this sub.  There is also something to the whole not wanting to face real world problems.  But even I admit to 44weeks as to long.

DeadBedrooms,3dxn8t,Civilwar1864,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:16:37 2015 UTC,"it would be nice if it could be discussed without the shaming.  i feel like we can't get a real discussion about it with our men because we have to tread so delicately around this male libido thing.    i probably haven't done the best job of separating the two issues- the shame from the relationship improvement that i seek.  but so many times these arguments are coming from some pretty severe pain.    and there is shame on the female side too.  women are often taught that their whole worth is measured by their attractiveness to men.  this is a lesson that is powerfully taught and ingrained in our society.  men reinforce that idea a lot with their ranking of women solely based on their sexual attractiveness.  so to be treated as though we are undesirable by the one man who is supposed to love us above all others really and inevitably cuts at our self worth, whether it ought to do that to that extent or not.  please, find other ways to assure your wife that you find her attractive.  not that it's your job to keep her self esteem afloat- just to help deal with the rejection that she feels and having to fight all the programming she has been subjected to her entire life.  k?  i might make that point into it's own post..."
DeadBedrooms,3dxn8t,cincofone,3,Tue Jul 21 00:10:59 2015 UTC,"In my case, the answer is a qualified yes. He can get an erection and he can keep it if I'm going down on him, but if we do anything else (aka PIV) it's likely to fade maybe 50% of the time these days (worse than it used to be). Most of the time I can get him back on track and across the finish line by switching between bj/piv but it takes effort and I think as time goes on this has become less and less effective. He will lose the boner every time during stuff not focused on his pleasure, like eating me out...it just doesn't excite him.   A related issue in my relationship is that I am so eager for any kind of sexual contact that I feel a lot of pressure to make it flawless for him when we do it...I don't want him to lose the erection/not have that great a time and then be even less interested in sex in the future. The upshot of this is that our sex is focused on his pleasure, not mine, which has really worn on me over the years. That's why I'm on this site now actually bc I've realized that as much as I enjoy focusing on him in bed, it has left me wanting more;  this approach isn't satisfying nor sustainable for me in the long term."

The difficult part is that his best...I'm afraid it really isn't enough. Ouch, hurts just to think that...but it is what it is.  He does have an inkling, we've talked about it many times, most recently just this Friday...we talked about how my pleasure isn't as high on the priority list as I need it to be, and I told him it's really critical for me to feel desired, and to have my pleasure valued, in this relationship. I suggested we schedule a session just to focus on my pleasure...my only hope is that maybe he could learn to love going down on me the way I at one point learned to love bjs. Doubtful...but I've gotta try, you know? Of course, he agreed to this suggestion (not the first time I've made it) but no movement towards actually making it happen. I'll have to make it happen if it's going to, I think.......same old same old.....I'm honestly not expecting anything to change.

I need to do this...recently he's been dealing with chronic kidney stone pain though, so I'm waiting for that to pass before I push it. Part of me is not sure I have the energy to really push it...I want more and better sex with him, but his lack of desire for me really puts a damper on my desire for him (even though I find him very attractive) so I'm not excited at the prospect of inviting further rejection (or unenthusiastic compliance).   That said, the alternative is divorce I think...and I'm not one to quit before I can at least say I tried everything I could think of first. So I'll keep trying.   it is just hard to bring it up because i know he is sooooo sick of the topic.   Oh man...sure he's tired of it, but I'm certain you are too!! It's not like you're talking about it because those conversations are so pleasurable for you. This is coming up because it's important for you both whether he recognizes that or not. I feel lucky that my partner recognizes the importance of this stuff to some degree, at least to where he doesn't try to make me feel bad for bringing it up.    i am just trying to make this a real and sustainable relationship. is that effort applauded? noooooo.   For what it's worth...I applaud it. :)  Not worth much, I know. I'm glad you're going to therapy--this is the sort of thing a good therapist can hopefully help him understand. You're not being selfish or annoying...you're trying to save the relationship for BOTH of you.   i did suggest scheduling sex today coincidentally. i got a vague response. looks like the weeks continue to accumulate for now.   Yeah I feel this. Scheduling sex has always been an exercise in disappointment for me when the promised sex does not materialize."

DeadBedrooms,3dxn8t,cincofone,2,Mon Jul 20 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"is that substantially related to a lack of sex drive?   Not really--I wouldn't expect anyone to get sexy while in pain like that. Our issues are because we have this trouble while he's feeling fine. Most of the time he's okay but occasionally he'll have a kidney stone attack like right now.   Yeah it's so crazy...it's like you're coming from two different planets with this stuff. It's so clearly critical to us but to them, perfectly fine as an afterthought.

Oh and by ""Helped"" out I mean on the literally 4 or 5 occasions, been laying on the bed, horny out of my mind wiht the tent fully pitched, and eventually she would go ""PFFFFFF fine"" followed by a hurry the fuck up and shoot your load out hand job. If there is jargon for starfish handjob, that would be the definition of it. I wouldn't even enjoy it if it was not for the pre cum. Some lube or spit or fuckin any thing...... Then i think well shit, if i could just get laid i'd be happy, but then the guilt. But wtf , how do you say ""I do"" then condem the one you're supposed to love, to a sexless life...... And expect them to be faithful? Sorry LL people, thats not how this works. And don't get me wrong, i'd be happy with legitimate hand jobs, or a blow job, For fucks sake buy a fucking flesh light and goto town on you HL S.O. Anything is better then nothing.   Speaking of flesh light, has any one tried doing this with your S.O. I had one when i was liek 19, they are decent, its a pain in the ass to get all horny, only to have to put it in the sink with hot water running over it, to make it warm. female LL, can some one try this and report back?

As a HL guy, even if I'm not actively THINKING about sex, I would be down for a shag at any time, any place. Family gathering? Sneak off to a guest bedroom for a bit, or go to the car. Public place? Bathroom, or again car. If my SO even hinted at wanting to have sex, I would be balls deep in her within 15 minutes even if we were in a fucking church.  That said, if you're 100% confident your guy isn't masturbating (or getting his needs met somewhere else) then he needs to go to the doctor and get his T levels checked. He also needs to start fitting the gym and lifting weight into his schedule. Once I started getting into heavy resistance training my libido shot through the roof, and I'm 33 years old...so if he's lost all interest in sex with a hot mid-20s woman at 25, there's something really wrong going on here."

Conversely, treating LL men (with or withoit low T levels) with T supplementation rarely results in siginificant improvement. And my own LL late husband had great T levels.  The exercise suggestion is great though! It raises libibo in both men and women.  Any type, it  doesn't have to be weight lifting, though that can be very effective. Just being in shape via regular exercise is often enough."

It is true that there's usually a honeymoon phase at first. So, it would make sense for there to be a slow decline. However, this seems to be rather extreme.

DeadBedrooms,3dxn8t,LostinAlaska,2,Mon Jul 20 16:27:35 2015 UTC,"This is sadly true.  I've been where you are OP. I met my late husband at age 21 in college,  we got married 2 years later,  and sex became more and more rare. By the time he died suddenly at age 27 (I was 26), we were having sex less than s handful of times per year, and I like, if not need, sex once a day mimimum. The only times we did have sex were bc I initiated, but I got sick of initiating.  It didn't help that we were both sexually submissive but not fully aware of it.  We were totally in love and extremely compatible in almost every other way (exception: I wanted kids ASAP,  he wanted to wait, but I definitely could have pushed that issue) and I can't imagine I'd ever have considered divorce. We were in the process of considering a open or poly marriage, and I'm sure that would have worked out eventually.   What drove me crazy is despite many discussions on the topic,  he never had much to say.  He could never explain to me WHY he didn't want sex/wouldn't initiate. I know part of it was due to his Catholic upbringing,  and there was the whole sub issue which I only realized in hindsight, but primarily I think he just had a naturally low libido, exacerbated by low level depression (dysthymia).  Only drugs or novelty could get him excited temporarily.   I'd consider getting his hormone, especially thryoid levels,  checked,  and be sure there are no mental issues. If those don't lead to a solution, you can consider an open relationship, if you're both amenable. If that's not an option, then decide how important sex is to you.  I've been widowed 8 years now, and despite having had 3 boyfriends (and several partners) who satisfied me sexually, I'd do anything to have my husband back. I'd be fine getting sex elsewhere or even having it rarely if that were my only option. Time hasn't healed my grief, but only made me more aware of what I lost. I fear I will never connect so well with anyone again. And dating at 34 is so much more difficult than in your 20s, let alone college."

DeadBedrooms,3dxn8t,graymaiden,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:20:38 2015 UTC,"Can I just add that your preference for your spouse that passed away over other men who satisfied you sexually is very interesting.  Most who leave dead bedrooms report the opposite. I wonder if not having a choice about the terms on which yours ended influences that? Or that relationship was so much better than what you have come across, even accounting for the lack of sex?  I'll, maybe annoyingly, reiterate that I'm so so sorry for your loss.  I hope your grief is dissipating over time."
DeadBedrooms,3dxn8t,cincofone,2,Tue Jul 21 14:20:44 2015 UTC,"I think my preference is twofold - 1. He really was that amazing, my soulmate (at least one of them) and so was our relationship,  and 2. I had the option to find sexual satisfaction elsewhere (I had already gone on a date before he died, and he was hanging out with a poly Domme) . So I feel strongly I would have found a solution. It wasn't a hopeless situation as many DBs seem to be. And I know how lucky I was to have that option. But even if I didn't have options...yes, I miss him THAT much.  I'm hoping I can help other HLs in DBs via my perspective. Sex is great, I love it, but it really isn't everything.  It's easy to feel overwhelmed  by frustration and resentment when you're in the thick of no-sexland, to the point that it blinds you to everything else that's good in the relationship. I feel strongly that each party maintains his initial status (frequency/quality of sex, keeping in shape physically etc) as much as possible,  and when it ISN'T possible,  I think the the negligent party should be as understanding and supportive as possible, and allow the HL to seek sex elsewhere if desired. It's not a solution for every DB,   but I think it should be more common and acceptable."
DeadBedrooms,3dxn8t,graymaiden,2,Tue Jul 21 14:47:52 2015 UTC,I'm glad for you that you had a really great love. I'm sad that it was taken away too soon. I'm taking your words seriously about whether the underlying love should be enough.
DeadBedrooms,3dxn8t,cincofone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:12 2015 UTC,"That's just how I feel. I AM  immensely grateful that I had the time with him that I did. Right after he died,  I was reasonably optimistic I could find a similarly good man with whom I was also sexually compatible, but that hope has dwindled over time and with experience.  I've also gained a major obstacle which makes meeting people/dating difficult. But I'm not totally hopeless yet. I really wish I were younger though!   Love alone is not reason enough to stay in a sex-starved relationship,  but the entire big picture CAN be. I know I didn't completely realize how lucky I was at the time. I think whether you're married yet or not makes a big difference,  but I'm really anti-divorce personally so that was never even an option for consideration in my case. You've also got to consider how important having children might be, as I haven't met anyone I consider acceptable even as a sperm donor. I deeply regret failing to extract/collect and save some of his sperm while he was on his deathbed (brain dead but otherwise viable)"

But I'm so committed to her/him that I'll lie, hide, and sneak around for sex while keeping this person who doesn't really love me in my life.""   ""Sex is very important to me and my spouse knew that going in.

""Sex is important enough for me to contemplate self-harm, but not important enough to contemplate divorce.""  So which is it? Sex is very important to a sense of self-worth and well-being, but sex is not worth growing a spine and finding a better partner. The lack of sex is eroding my ability to love, so I'm going to go have sex with someone who I cannot love. Sex is so important that it's ruining my life, but I'll do everything in my power to preserve this ruined life, including lying, cheating, sneaking around, and living with the constant fear that I'll be caught and ruined.

For example, if she had stated that her husband still expected monogamy so she just cheats behind his back and that's morally okay because he's SUPER rich, and not doing that would mean she could lose MILLIONS or be ""forced"" into CELIBACY, etc. I would say the millions and the forced celibacy are a moot point, she's still being unethical by lying and manipulating. (I understand that was not the point she was making, but she was emphasizing the amount of money involved and this is a thread about cheating...)   You interpreted her marriage as a strict financial contract with his approval of her extramarital affairs. Well, great, sounds like those are factors to consider when determining if her behavior is moral.

I know plenty of couples who have been married 10+ years who have daily sex.   I suggest you be brutally honest and tell her what you expect out of your marriage. If she balks than she is not the one for you.

Her ligic, if you can call it that, is that they had so much sex it became routine and wasn't SPESHUL anymore, so he didn't see it as something reserved for just them.  Which is probably not what happened at all. He was probably just an asshole.   And I'm all for romance and pampering her and whatever else she wants to do. But sometimes I just want sex. Like I reach over and put an arm around her and kiss her and we have sex. I don't want to have to leave a trail of rose petals leading to the bed, which I've out new satin sheets on, and hire a Mariachi band every time we have sex. Sex IS a routine thing couples do. Sometimes it can be romantic and sometimes raunchy and sometimes a little boring. She can't seem to get her head around that."

It sounds like to me she's one of these types that sex is like a rocket launch as you put it. I personly have always gravitated to girls who have a slight slutty side because I know what I want and there was no beating around the bush.   Look you can't change how a person is and that's the problem here. You want her to be someone she just is not. You want her to be the girl who enjoys being pushed up on a wall on a whim and just fucked like crazy style. That's not this chic. She apparently wants wined and dined.

I understand where you're coming from on your sexual preferences (even though I don't think we fully understand it) and I'd like to go to a few sessions of couples therapy together. I hope you'll agree because I love you and I want our sex life to feel healthy and special for both of us, even when we don't have candles around to light."" because honestly, she sounds scarred and its the best way for you to get a therapist to help her break down those walls. Search in your area for a female therapist so that she feels more comfortable but interview the therapists alone to make sure she understands where you are coming from and why you are seeking therapy. I don't think you can break down that wall alone."

Personally, I would have been out the door right here. You know what feels awesome? When you go up to your partner and say ""wanna go do it?"" and they say ""YES!"". It beats having to jump through hoops of fire.  So my suggesstion would be this. Tell her: SO, I care for you. I love you and I'll never cheat on you. But I won't jump through hoops every time we have sex. That makes me feel undesired and like I have to perform and prove myself every time. Sex is already special because it's something we are doing together and only together. That's all the special I need from sex. If this relationship is to continue, we need to meet more in the middle. Less setting the mood and more enjoying the special thing that only we do.""  If that doesn't work, show her this post and leave."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,SemSevFor,26,Mon Jul 20 20:50:54 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing a lot of assumptions from other commenters here about your SO.  So I want to state the facts from your post.  Which is all the information we have at the moment.   She's not LL, this is not an issue with differing libidos. She didn't always need to set the mood, its because of the cheating ex she is doing this. He didn't cheat because of setting the mood(because of #2), he doesn't necessarily need a reason to cheat.  Some people are just assholes.  And there's no way to know why he did it for sure.  Occam's razor, the simplest solution?  He's a cheating asshole. She's skeptical because of what happened before with the other guy.  She is, to be blunt, overreacting because she trusted someone and had that trust broken.   This is not the typical type of post we get here.  So everyone treating it like one should reread your post and stop reading between the lines and making assumptions on things we don't know.  Ok, OP.  She is scared and afraid that what happened before will happen to her again.  She is projecting the exs behaviour onto you.  But you are not him, and she should not be.  You need to prove to her that you are not him.  The only way you can do that is to talk to her about all of this.  Acknowledge her fear of the situation.  Tell her how you feel.  Explain that you are not a cheating asshole and that you ARE NOT him.  Tell her what you've told us in this post, that you can't go big everytime.  You need to make her feel comfortable so that she can trust you the way she used to her ex.  She's like a little girl who went to pet a puppy but the puppy bit her and now she's afraid of all puppies unless they approach her, and they have not growl, and their tail has to be wagging, and they have to be happily panting, and this and that, etc.  You have to show her you will never bite her, you just want to be petted without having to put on a show everytime.  Hopefully, she can realize all of this and learn to trust you, and open up to you.  Some people can, some people can't, only time and true communication will tell.  She seems genuine from what you've told us.  I had a gf who was very closed off to sex because she was almost raped once, and then lost her virginity to a guy who didn't treat her well.  So I had to gain her trust and help her come out of her shell, which she did in time.  Unfortunately she turned out to be an LL as well, and that along with several other factors lead to our breakup.  But the point is that it is possible.  I helped her change from sex is terrible to sex is fun over the course of our relationship.  She just didn't want it as much.  But enough about me.  I hope this helps OP, I wish you the best of luck.  And I'm rooting that things work out for you. :)"
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,rarelyamused,3,Mon Jul 20 12:35:53 2015 UTC,This is the response you should be reading OP.
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,SkyLukewalker,5,Mon Jul 20 08:34:25 2015 UTC,This is terrible advice. Never martyr yourself to the issues of your partner. Only someone inexperienced and/or naive thinks they can fix their partner. Ditch her and find someone you are more compatible with.
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,SemSevFor,4,Mon Jul 20 10:13:14 2015 UTC,"That's not what I'm suggesting at all.  I'm saying communicate with her and discuss the problem.  Hes not fixing in the sense the he's changing who she is.  She didn't used to be like this, this is her way of reacting to a bad situation that happened to her.  If she is understanding and realizes this is what she is doing, this problem can be fixed.  It all depends on her.  He needs to be supportive and open and honest about the situation.  If she is unwilling to fix the problem, then by all means, leave her.  I'm saying he should be supportive and give her a chance to see that this is an issue.  She my not even realize it's this big of a problem.  There's no martyring or fixing her.  She can fix her negative reaction if she chooses to, and he can help with that, but there's no guarantee.  He can take a chance and try to help her, which may end in happiness for them.  But it could also end in sadness if she is unwilling to make the change.  Not sure why you think I was suggesting anything other than that."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,SkyLukewalker,2,Mon Jul 20 21:20:56 2015 UTC,"You seem to put all the onus on him when she is the one with the problem. You can't fix people, they have to fix themselves."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,SemSevFor,2,Mon Jul 20 21:44:50 2015 UTC,"I'm saying he should support her, and communicate, that's it.  Of course he can't make her change.  But they should discuss the issue.  That way she knows how he feels about it and then decides what to do about it.  If she decides she wants to trust him and change how she wants sex, that's up to her.  He can't demand it, he can't force it, he can't make it happen.  But he can tell her the current situation doesn't work for him, and he doesn't like the situation.  If she seems open to change, he can ask what he can do to help her.  Maybe there's nothing he can do, maybe there's a lot.  That's all up to her as well.  And if she isn't open to change, then maybe it's time for him to move on like he has considered.  That decision is up to him.  I'm only saying he shouldn't make that decision until he gives her a chance to make hers.  The only way that's going to happen is to communicate and discuss that its an issue for him."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,Dank_1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"RE: your numbered list...there's no way to know if she's being honest with OP or just saying whatever she thinks sounds plausible to get out of having sex.  Look at the actions, not the words.  Based on the fact that she's 24 and can go 2 weeks without sex, I'd say she's either low libido or very sex-negative/religiously damaged.  Or both."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,SemSevFor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:44:34 2015 UTC,"This is the information OP has given us to work with.  OP says multiple times in the post and comments that she is not LL.  And this isn't an LL issue.  If you read the post its obvious that she is overreacting to being cheated on.  It is true, there is a chance that she was lying about some of the things.  But we have no reason to believe that.  The leap in logic required for what you propose is ridiculous.  There is a chance that her ex never cheated and died of a heart attack during sex, which caused her fear.  There is a chance that she is secretly a manipulative person and she is playing with OP waiting to see how long it takes for him to crack.  There is a chance she is an alien in disguise with a heavy culture around ritual coitus.  All of these are possibilities, but we have no reason to believe any of them are the case over what OP gave us.  There is no proof of anything other than what he's saying.  Its obvious that she is overreacting to the cheating ex.  It's the solution that makes the most sense and fits with OPs information.  Two weeks doesn't necessarily mean low libido.  There are a million factors in play that we don't know.  Maybe they are a LDR, maybe OP rejected her initiation a few times because he didn't want to put on a show, maybe it was a busy and stressful two weeks for both of them and it slipped through the cracks.  There's no evidence of anything.  You are assuming things that we have no evidence for.  We don't have the full story.  All we have is what OP has told us to go on.  OP said she is not LL and that she enjoys sex.  I have no reason to believe this is not the case.  We can guess and guess at the million possibilities but there's no point to that.  So instead of wildly assuming I gave OP advice based on what was said.  The most logical conclusion one can make based off his post is the one I stated.  If OP provides other evidence that this is not the case. Then I will gladly accept the conclusion made off of that new evidence, and give different advice if I feel I know what that would be."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,SemSevFor,4,Tue Jul 21 02:36:26 2015 UTC,"Don't attempt relationships with mentally retarded people   Wow, words cannot even describe the number of things absolutely wrong with that sentence.  Are you 13?  That is just not ok.   Find someone mature, a real woman, not someone who thinks like a little girl   She is not immature.  I was not saying she was a little girl, because she isn't.  It's called a metaphor.  It's a literary device used to convey meaning through similar situations.  That does not mean she is a little girl or acts like a little girl.  Your logic is so flawed it'd be almost funny if it wasn't so fucked up.  Yes she is afraid because of things that happened to her.  She needs help overcoming this, not to be shunned for it.  You wouldn't tell a friend whose father just died that you want to stop being friends because he's sad and pouty all the time.  They need to get over it, and they need help.  Whether this is something OP wants to help with, is entirely up to him.  Something happened to her that she is not coping with very well.  OP can leave if he wants.  But he claims she's a great girl, and seems very fond of her.  Most people in relationships like that are willing to help the other person through their difficulties and hardships, because they love them.    She is not a child just because she isn't coping well with events that happened to her.  Would you call a war veteran with PTSD a moron for not leaving that on the battlefield?  Treating her like this is a very dickish thing to do.  Some people don't cope well, that doesn't mean they aren't an adult, or don't deserve to be in a relationship, or any of that shit.  Again your logic is so very flawed, it's almost funny.   Do not lower yourself to the point of talking about yourself as a dog   Wow, seriously?  METAPHOR, do you even understand what that means?  Have you ever read a book?  Taken a Literature course of some kind?  How ignorant are you?   Why do you advise other people to fail like you did?   I did not fail.  There's two separate things going on in my story.  One being the helping out of her shell, the other being the relationship as a whole.  I succeeded in helping her out of her shell, it worked for me.  It is possible.  The problem was nothing to do with that part.  There were other factors, unrelated to this that caused the breakup.  I went on a tangent and told the rest of the story, when I didn't need to.  The only part I needed to tell was about her changing.  But I included the ending as well.  For example, one factor was that she wanted kids someday, I didn't.  That was one reason of the several why we broke up, and it has nothing to do with the part I was talking about.  OP seems to be in a good place with his gf, and their only big apparent issue is this bedroom issue.  Had that been the only problem in my relationship, it would have worked out.  I am not advising him to fail like I did because I'm only advising being there for her and gaining her trust, which is possible to do, and something I succeeded at.  The point of my story was to show that it can and has been done.  How it ended, doesn't matter, because that was unrelated to the point I was making.  I succeeded in what I was advising OP to do, which is why I advised it.  It's not perfect, not everyone will be able to open up and trust again, but some can.  The only way to find out is for OP to try.  To be supportive and gain her trust.  Your worldview is very skewed and self-centered.  You don't see the big picture.  OP's gf might open up to him and understand.  She might trust him, and they might work it out.    Yes that's a lot of ""might""s.  It's a chance.  It's not guaranteed, nothing in this life is guaranteed.  Relationships don't magically just work perfectly.  They need work.  OP has to decide whether he thinks taking this chance is worth it to him, if she is worth it to him.  No one can make that choice but him.  You seem to think relationships just work, and if there's any issue, you leave.  That's not how it works.  There are fights, problems, issues, that need to be communicated about and worked through constantly.  Even the best matched couple will still bicker and fight about little things.  That's the nature of relationships.  Some have more than others.  When the issues become too much for the value of the relationship, someone leaves.  There are no perfect relationships, there can be bad ones.  Things never ""just work"".  And if you think they do, you are going to live a sad and heartbroken life."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,graymaiden,2,Tue Jul 21 03:24:13 2015 UTC,"Manipulating a LL to have more sex is not good advice. Not only is it unlikely to work, but even if it does lead to more sex, do you really want to have sex with someone who isn't truly enjoying it? Who is just doing it to please you? That's not satisfying sex IMO (and I've been on both sides of that scenario).  While I don't think you worded it well, I will agree that discussion doesn't serve much purpose with innately LLs, bc they can't change the way they are. It isn't their fault and they're not inferior, and neither is just wanting a baby without much sex (though I truly believe that in most such cases, the woman would be interested in more sex with the right man). As long as everyone is honest with themselves and their partners,  of course."

DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,hab136,7,Mon Jul 20 03:49:48 2015 UTC,"She's not LL. She wants to have more sex too and honestly if I had the energy to recreate a scene from a chick flick every night, she'd probably have sex every night.  I just can't handle it being a big production all the time."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,graymaiden,8,Mon Jul 20 04:48:30 2015 UTC,"Actions speak louder than words.  If she wanted to have more sex, she would.  It sounds like you're having to bust your ass just to get her in the mood.  Is she putting in an equal amount of effort?  Yes, I'd like a 7-course meal at a fancy restaurant.  That doesn't mean I'm going to starve between fancy meals; it just means some meals are going to be fancy, some are going to be middling, and some are going to be fast food.  Eating normal food between fancy meals doesn't ""cheapen"" the fancy meals; that's idiotic."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,AvastInAllDirections,2,Mon Jul 20 18:59:59 2015 UTC,"I strongly agree. I think if she were truly THAT attracted to you, she wouldn't need a fancy set up.  To give you an example...I have OCD and it affects me sexually in that I prefer to be freshly washed in my nether region before sex, bc I find urine gross. But I've broken that rule for some guys bc I was too attracted to them to care. Another example - my default in most relationships has been sex once a day, but with willing partners I was strongly attracted to, we'd have sex many times daily. So regardless of libido,  how much sex a woman has can depend on the man.  Is she on hormonal birth control or any meds? If so, did she go on the pill shortly after meeting you or was she already on it? Bc that could lower her libido and also reduce your pheromone effect on her, reducing her sexual attraction for you."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,Sympathyforthebadguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:54:00 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is, it's not her, it's you.  You've not got the energy for the song and dance. You'd like to get to the sex & skip the things your SO counts as foreplay. Get in, get it on, get off and get out. Answer this honestly: would you, several years into a relationship with a ""normal"" woman (maybe you two are married, with kids), ever do any of the things your current SO wants you two to do so she could prime herself mentally to enjoy sex? (What would those things be?) If the answer is something like, ""yes, three times a year,"" you're wasting your SO's time, and your common future does not appear promising."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,iBeNiko,12,Mon Jul 20 07:17:04 2015 UTC,"Not at all! The idea that someone would be driven to cheat because they were having ""too much sex"" sounds spurious at best. More likely she has come up with that as the reason because it reinforces her already held belief that ""sex is always bad"".   Remember, an LLs perception of "" too much sex"" could be as little as ""any sex at all""."

DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,Mrsdoralice,6,Mon Jul 20 05:00:33 2015 UTC,"Sexual compatibility is a thing.  You need to sit her down and have a serious discussion with her about this in a non-sexual environment.  You need to let her know that you're not happy with this aspect of your relationship and if it goes on that it will lead you to become angry and resentful about sex and that's going to lead to either one of two things.  You'll either end up breaking up, or cheating on her.  Then, if she's willing to listen then maybe you can discuss solutions that are amenable to both of you.

You are dating a little girl, refusing to act like a grown up woman, trying to pretend that sex is something that needs to be always perfect, romantic and pure. Lets cut the crap, sex can be dirty, nasty and spontaneous and THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. Serious? 2 weeks without sex and she wants you to set the mood? thats ridiculous. What happens in the future when you two are married and have kids, jobs, house to clean it, bills to pay it?  Do you still has to set the mood? this is exhausting.   You two should have sex when you desire and many times you desire, this idea to save sex in order to not cheapen it its absurd and childish.

Your writing and expression is so good I hope you are doing it for a living, but when confronted with a wall of speech with several points to address, she probably has all the time in the world to cherry pick the minor points she has a ready response for while leaving the crux unresolved.

Next time you make a move and she counters with that saccharine fantasy speech, tell her she's a pain in the ass or better yet, say ""Nope"" and walk away. Nope is a complete sentence.

Wow this made me laugh really hard.  I could honestly just never be with someone who had that attitude towards sex, man. Sometimes sex is just fucking because you woke up super wet after a hot dream. IMO sex should be dirty and cheap sometimes, sleepy and lazy sometimes too. I have no advice because the problem is quite clearly her attitude - she needs to either change it or find someone else who wants every orgasm to be a serenade to Odin."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,King-Of-The-Hill,2,Mon Jul 20 20:00:15 2015 UTC,"Treating sex like an Aztec ceremony where we have to spend weeks collecting animals and growing herbs.   Oh, you slay me! Seriously, this is a variant of the Disney princess fetish - thinking sex ought to be this holy Union every time. I don't know what the cure is, other than just some years of experience with different partners who will, by reacting poorly to her demand for Holy Sex, show her that her requirements are not normative. Unless she finds one of these Tantric sex people. I hear Sting is single again.  But not only some churchy, pathologically romantic, and/ or spiritually ""advanced"" lovers like their foreplay theatrical. Some players in the BDSM community are into candles (often of red wax), and what is power exchange but a kind of stage setting? Some power exchange isn't too labor intensive (for the dominant partner), and, once you give the signal that it's time for her to mentally prepare for future ravishment (let's say, by warning her she must wax it all off by Tuesday, or that she'd better wear no undies on Saturday, as you'll be checking), you two can go on about y'all's business, giving her time to sautée in anticipation of the moment when you'll manfully take her, without knowing when it may be. Thus hopefully, by the time you feel like having a mostly spontaneous shag, the ""mood"" will have all been pre-set (TRANSLATION: she will have had time to get mentally excited, which will have had time to cause her to get wet and interested in the sexual menu you're offering.) At this point it may not hurt your relationship to look into it (assuming she may like being submissive.)"

DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,LauraPa1mer,7,Mon Jul 20 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, you're putting that all on her?? That seems extremely harsh. She was more sexually open with him, and he cheated on her, that's pretty shitty. And it's not like she's withholding sex in this relationship, she's even the one bringing it up:    She said to me, we haven't had sex in like 2 weeks. What should we do to set the mood tonight?   Why so hard on her? She got burned by a cheater. She deserves some understanding and compassion for wanting to protect herself emotionally whether you agree with how she's doing it or not. She's prioritizing sex, she just wants it to be a certain way. Sure, maybe she could stand to relax a little on her fears about making sure it's special, and OP can work on that with her with some patience and compassion. But I don't think she deserves this kind of vitriol based on what OP has said."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,King-Of-The-Hill,-3,Mon Jul 20 18:36:09 2015 UTC,What she says vs what is true is completely open to interpretation. How many times have we seen where the LL thought they had sex last week when in reality it was two months ago. People wire their minds to fit their own narrative and eventually they brainwash themselves into believing it.
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,thewoooooorst,5,Mon Jul 20 23:05:45 2015 UTC,That doesn't sound like the case here though. LL doesn't seem to be the problem...in this case it's more what she expects as part of sex itself isn't something OP enjoys.
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,King-Of-The-Hill,4,Mon Jul 20 04:51:54 2015 UTC,"She is not LL, Op stated this and from what he says, it doesn't sound like it.  Stop assuming she is.  Just because they are having an issue in the bedroom DOES NOT mean that is a HL/LL issue.  There are other reasons for issues in the bedroom than that.  It's just one of the most common."

DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,King-Of-The-Hill,4,Mon Jul 20 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"Speaking as an HL partner who has cheated, there is no excuse for cheating. Yes, there are circumstances and problems which create an environment where cheating is a greater danger, and it's prudent to be aware of that and address it head-on and without judgment. It's a very understandable human impulse and there are often legitimate issues in the relationship that lead to a person getting to that point, we can agree on that much. But the desire to cheat should be the red flag for taking action to prevent this kind of betrayal (either by resolving issues or ending the relationship). The person who decides to take the action of cheating is fully culpable for that, and it does undermine their credibility to a large extent because it's not okay to break your word like that to someone you love no matter what's going on in the relationship.   Easier said than done, I know, believe me. I wish our culture didn't hold monogamy up as the be-all-end-all-one-size-fits-all-required-solution-for-all. But if you make a promise to someone and fail to keep it without having renegotiated the arrangement, that's not something you can blame on someone else. Just my two cents."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,horses_and_flowers,2,Mon Jul 20 17:53:21 2015 UTC,I'm also a HL that had an affair. I wouldn't of had it if my wife had held up her end of the bargain. Even our marriage counselor saw that aspect after years of counseling.  You are right - We OWN the choice to cheat. THere is no taking that back. Affairs are but a symptom of what is wrong in the marriage and not what is wrong.

I'd be interested in trying it but I don't feel like I need it.   She just thinks that if we get kinky or sex becomes just something we do, then all I'll see her as is a source of sex and I'll suddenly morph into her jerkbag ex."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,thewoooooorst,2,Mon Jul 20 16:41:15 2015 UTC,She went two weeks before asking for sex. That sounds LL to me.
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,thewoooooorst,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:35:36 2015 UTC,"That could all be what she is projecting too. We see all the time how LL partners think they just had sex with their partners last week when it really had been months.   Doesn't mean it's true, but doesn't mean she isn't making excuses either."

Her issues are deeper than you and what she's telling, which sounds sorta fishy. I'm in a DB, and I'm not leaving yet and I want it to work, so here I am being a hypocrite and throwing my stone, but, since you're not married and hopefully not entangled financially, leave her. You probably will not regret forming a relationship with someone who has a healthy attitude about sex and doesn't require Aztec sacrifices or chick-flick reenactments. Good luck."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,thewoooooorst,2,Mon Jul 20 07:23:52 2015 UTC,"Sounds like she needs therapy.  leave her   Or give her a chance to get help BEFORE leaving her. This might be fixable if she's as open-minded as OP says. What in her background might have caused her to put sex on such a pedestal that she interpreted her ex's cheating as proof that sex must always be treated as solemn and sacred? Has she been heavily influenced by a religious upbringing? slut-shaming from her family and friends?  Maybe she'd love to have sex more freely, if she could just work through her fears."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,larocipe,2,Mon Jul 20 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"OR, OP could make therapy a condition of the relationship continuing.    That one is simply defective   Wow. Not troubled or deluded or wrong, but defective. Nice."

Ewwwww. This isn't okay. Like it or not, she IS human and there is absolutely no excuse to dehumanize her no matter how many words you use to defend that notion. No.  It is possible to evaluate whether your own needs are being met without having to dehumanize people you supposedly love. In fact, it's essential to keep their needs in mind while you consider your own, because as soon as you fail to be aware of the other person's needs, you are focused only on yourself and you have ZERO chance of ever connecting and improving your relationship with someone else.   When someone is not performing, they are let go.   Dude, being someone's life partner is not the same as being employed by them.

It's not all or nothing. We need to think of sexual partners realistically, as our equals, with equally human needs and desires. Not gods and not sex toys--just fellow humans worthy of respect.   When you are unable to objectify your partner, you are unable to have sex with them.   I completely disagree. You can appreciate and desire someone physically without literally mentally reducing them to an inhuman object. The fact that you can't conceive of this says more about you than anything else.   Yes, she is a human being, but this is not a good enough reason to treat her like someone superhuman or godly.   Again, not saying he should, and in fact, no one ever said this except you--but she deserves to be treated as a human being for goodness' sake."

But I'm not sure she GETS how big a deal this is to OP. And I do feel sorry for her because I suspect there's a lot of insecurity and shame behind her princess demands. All I'm picturing is a last discussion in which OP is deadly serious, not snarky, and tells  her ""I am unhappy with this situation, it's threatening our future together. I love you and am willing to help you work this out, but I will not keep paying for your ex's cheating, and I can't go on jumping through hoops to prove that I'm not using you.""

And I say this as someone who has cheated. :(   OP's gf obviously has the wrong idea that she's good for nothing else than sex, that's why she is so irrational when the topic crops up.   Some compassion is in order here. Women get this message CONSTANTLY (that we're only good for sex) and have to figure out how to deal with that in the real world, while staying sexually healthy, protecting ourselves from the MANY people out there who are more than happy to mistreat us, all while keeping a good sense of self-worth and being able to trust others while so many other people are judging our actions (on everything from our choice of clothes to the things we say to our choice of partner) from every possible angle, every day, for our entire lives. It's not NEARLY as easy as you seem to think it is, and there's nothing in OP's post to make me think this girl is psychologically unsound. She's been treated badly and she sounds traumatized to some degree.   Maybe OP can make it work and maybe he can't...it's okay if he needs to leave because his needs aren't being met. But either way, she hasn't committed some crime here and she is deserving of respect and a modicum of understanding for where she's coming from.  I think this relationship could be salvageable if OP can have a little more respect and sympathy for her, and work with her to open up, trust him and understand that she's not risking anything by making sex a little less of a formal event. She could warm to that idea in time if he is willing to be both patient and honest with her."
DeadBedrooms,3dwjvu,thewoooooorst,2,Mon Jul 20 15:13:50 2015 UTC,"You need to be completely honest with her in as non-judgmental a way possible. The conflict here is about your different viewpoints on sex and what place you want it to have in your lives. Tell her that you're beginning to be afraid that you're not compatible and you want to have an honest discussion about both of your views on sex in a relationship.   If she's unwilling to have that discussion with you, break up with her. If she has that discussion with you then be honest and free-of-anger and non-judgmental, work on actively listening, and make sure she hears what you're actually saying and doesn't just have a knee-jerk reaction to something that triggers her insecurities. Try o find a real compromise - and if you realize that isn't possible then break up.   Honestly, I would be wary. She has a low sex drive and the last thing you'd want her to do is temporarily amp it up to get you to marry her and then drop it back down to her actual level."

Usually I'm one for ""try this, try that"", but in your case - No. Your sexual needs are SO different, and the sexual element of the relationship is obviously important to you, just go.  It's only been a year and you're absolutely  spewing hatred.  Get out.  Let you both be happy with other people.  BTW, you call her a 'great girl'.  At 24 she's a full grown adult woman, not a girl.

So she feels guilty about making me sad, which makes the matters a bit more complicated. I try approaching it without making her feel pressured, but It doesn't seem to work, since, today, she was the one who brought it up.  She said that it shouldn't be a reason for me to break up due to lack of sex. And that there are some many qualities on the relationship, therefore I should be greateful. She made an analogy as well saying that she wouldn't break up if I didn't want to kiss her, because I was worth it.

So you need to help her understand that sex is important to you. If she cannot, you leave her.  Tell her how you really feel. Sex is important and is a need for you.

Dilators might help or perhaps you need to have your pelvic floor muscle relaxed (there are different therapies for that).   It sounds like you have a wonderfully supportive boyfriend and that you don't want to have a dead bedroom so that's a step in the right direction. What about other forms of sexual intimacy - oral?

And we are capable of having an orgasm, either done by ourselves or each other.   Lately i just found myself in a bit of a sex depression, not wanting to do anything sexual because i just ended up feeling frustrated when i could not have penetration. It felt as if i left every time we were intimate unfinished. I should get started on doing those type of things more, i acknowledge that. It's just difficult.

Its intense energy holds the other particles of the relationship in orbit."

That is a lovely way to put it!  i generally just think of it as helping the couple be close enough to get through all the shit that a relationship goes through.  But the way you put it is much cooler.  And picking up from another thread- thanks for not accidentally using ""it's""."

DeadBedrooms,3dv6sk,cincofone,8,Mon Jul 20 21:49:45 2015 UTC,Hypothyroid is serious...I've dealt with it for 10 years.  A few things really helped me with energy and sex drive.  B12 and vitamin D...staying away from carbs.  Eating whole foods and doing even 5 minutes of exercise a day helps a ton with the sluggish feeling.      Keeping my brain in erotic mode.  I know it sounds silly but indulge in books and movies that turn you on but better books than 50 shades.   There are plenty of great thyroid resources to help you with more tips.  Gg

Just one quick question, if you don't mind:   My TSH levels are ""back to normal"", so they tell me, but I still feel the physical symptoms I had before.   The thyroid supplement you're taking, is it synthetic or natural? My reason for asking is selfish. I'm dealing with a severe loss of libido that started at the same time I was diagnosed as hypothyroid. I've been doing a lot of reading about the issue, and one of the things that keeps cropping up is the difference in patient reactions to the two different thyroid replacement regimens (synthetic vs natural). I'm gathering any info I can before my next doctor's appointment.  Again, I wish both you and your husband the very best."

My advice has been, to all of the HL DB OP's on here to suck it up and work on themselves because no amount of talking to their LL SO will make them wake up and change. It just breeds resentment from both partners, and the LL partner just hears ""I want to use you for sex"", they most definitely do not hear ""I hurt so bad from all your rejections and am now withholding parts of self as a defense against further pain, why don't you love me."" I am glad you made the effort and found this sub. I can only hope my SO does the same thing, and soon, because I am deeper than I care to be in a DB and am already making plans to leave."

Saying something like ""i have done this and that in the house and i want to finish it tomorrow, if you got any suggestions, just tell me"" or ""i starting to repair this and that tomorrow"" leaves room to say something about it in any direction one wants to say something, or say nothing at all (which is better than ""IDK"".  i feel that your relationship has a bunch of different challenges,  this pattern of communication might add to the problem. It's also very interesting what people say if they are not asked, you see it could also happen, that your communication breaks down for a little bit, because you two are so used to have this interrogation game where the whole conversation consists of questioning and answering instead of an open and free talking with each other, where everyone just talks away freely and candidly without the need to ""answer"" something specific. sorry for talking about something you were not interested, but i felt from your post, that your current style of communication with each other might hinder to disclose your problems.  simply put: less questions more statements."

So I did just that, and told her 'my therapist said I should tell you how I communicate so you can better understand me' and that I prefer to communicate in a matter of fact way without emotional bias.  I can foresee myself making a statement such as ""I'm going to do this or that, do you have any input"" and it being interpreted as an attack or maybe a sarcastic twist (maybe not the right words) on what she had said she wanted me to do (ask for her opinion) and therefore end up as a negative in her mind.

She also self-admittedly has no motivation (for anything).  She dropped off anti-depressants right before the marriage saying she felt like she didn't need them anymore.     I think they would probably help her immensely, but she's got what I consider pharmacophobia, and makes a huge deal out of taking any medication.  Her doctors office had just suggested she take something her hereditary high cholesterol and she's having a major depressive episode over that.   I'm sure there's more to her issues than I know, but she's unable to communicate them, so that doesn't help.  It's a shame because I get on well with her family Even my mother suggested that I plan an exit strategy.

Blood levels normal, for the test (but may not be 'normal' for her body chemistry)   And says because she has to take the levo for the rest of her life, she will not take any other medication 'for the rest of her life'.  I asked her if she said anything to her doctor about her drive or how she feels.

DeadBedrooms,3dtn1a,Deadbed5128,5,Sun Jul 19 10:00:07 2015 UTC,"OP. Listen to me. THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. You're a good man and you seem like a good husband. You're doing your absolute best. Lots of women would kill to have a guy like you. You're perceptive, caring, and your trying to take care of a problem.  Please bear with me because this may be a little hard to hear: if she, your wife, was blackmailed into having sex with another man, if she truly felt that the choice was either to have sex with him or to have hers (and your) life ruined--that's very likely rape, not infidelity. Many states in the US (and I don't know that you are in the US) have amended their rape laws to include blackmail statutes. In Canada, it is also considered rape.  If she was ""overcome by fear,"" (even if that is the fear of hers and your humiliation, the destruction of her marriage, etc) that is rape. THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. Its not her fault. Its the fault of the man who perpetrated the act. You cannot blame yourself; and you should not blame her. Place the fault where it lies: with this man who used her vulnerability to harm her and you.  Having a sexual trauma in her life, especially one that is not recognized for what it is, may seriously be effecting her libido.  My advice would be to get help. Do some google searches on extortion and sexual assault. Inform yourself about what might have happened to her and keep the lines of communication open. PLEASE go to see a therapist, either together or just her. Guilt and shame might be eating her alive right now, and she doesn't know how to cope with it.  Above all, please remember, this is not your fault. No one could possibly blame you and you shouldn't blame yourself. You sound like a good husband who is looking for solutions, and that's awesome."

You did see this earlier, but you wanted to the protector and was hoping she would change. Give her the emotional connection she needs like small talk, little pecks and cuddling. Women need that to want sex.  Now is not the time for resentment, there is going to less sex as she is pregnant and tired and since you have a baby on the way and you two need to start concentrating on being parents together."

I haven't brought the sex part up yet, hoping that the therapy itself will work some of the otherstuff out, thus helping the sexual part. Once I calmed down, I talked to her about reporting him, contacting the school, etc. She flat out refused, I think out of embarassment. I am trying not to rock the boat too much right now with the pregnancy and all, but it gets hard sometimes.

DeadBedrooms,3dqsgi,MidnightDemon,3,Sun Jul 19 01:09:10 2015 UTC,Hormonal IUD are 2 parts physical protection 1 part chemical protection.  The shape makes the egg much less likely to attach and typically a small bad of copper does some magic and has been used for non-h birth control since the 70s.  I think it changes the acid levels in your uterine lining to inhospitable levels.  Look into a few ones that are available in your country.

DeadBedrooms,3dqsgi,idobutidont,2,Sun Jul 19 09:47:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, before I lost mine, my current bf (not the previous one I had the DB with) said he could feel the strings sometimes when we had sex. He also said it didn't hurt but that he could feel it, and that it was different. I was concerned about that but not enough to have it removed, then my uterus kicked it soon after so it was a bit irrelevant.  I can't be on any hormone BC because of family medical history, so once I lost the copper IUD the doctor told me good luck and gave me a prescription for a cervical cap. I never got it filled because I found out about FAM before I could find a pharmacy which stocked it. FAM isn't for everyone but if you're out of hormone-free options (there's really only barrier methods and the copper IUD) it's a godsend. It works particularly well for me too because my cycles are a bit longer than some women (34-35 days) so there are a lot of days that I'm neither fertile or bleeding that I can have unprotected sex. There's only 6 days out of the 35 day period we have to use condoms, give or take a few days on the rare instance I get sick and need to play it safe because my temperature readings are off. The technology is getting better for FAM too... I kickstarted a wearable thermometer that once I get it (it's still pre-mass-production) is supposed to allow me to set it and forget it when I go to bed... No waking up at the same time everyday and remembering to take my temperature (and no waking up my bf in the process). I'm hoping when I get it, it works as promised, though I'm going to use it alongside my normal thermometer for a few months to make sure it's accurate first."

We thought we were just hardly ever having sex because we lived at her parents house but since we moved into our own place it hasn't changed. This pill is the best she's used in some ways (the others made her depressed) but it has made sex non-existent. She and I both agree it's the pill which is destroying her sex drive.   For the last month I've asked her to book an appointment with the doctor to talk about trying a different pill/contraceptive. She has still not booked one. I am getting more and more frustrated. Wondering if she cares. I find myself daydreaming about fucking other women a lot.  Feels good to get this off my chest but thinking about the situation gets me down.

We had even had a huge fight (her mentioning divorce and me moving out, all that) the night before we had sex for the first time in about a year. I was sleeping in a different room and everything. Funny how it had got that bad then all of a sudden we're fine.  Good luck my friend. Maybe suggest calling for her, helping make the appointment in some way.

Every single time I've seen a gyno about anything bc related, libido has NEVER come up. I came across that information myself after doing my own research online and the main reason I ended up switching to the non-hormonal IUD was that my hormonal bc started giving me severe moodswings/depression. At first the libido stuff was just some extra info, but later I started taking it more seriously. Maybe try giving your girl info about other womens' experiences? I don't know but it seems you have a big talk on your horizon. Idk if your girl is on reddit but a big motivator for me to take sex stuff more seriously is reading about others men's experiences in dbs.

While there are many positive things about the RP philosophy, one I disagree with is the all or nothing attitude.  I believe a real man can be both  steel and velvet.  I believe there are times when each behavior is needed in a man's life, and one goal of a man is to develop both sides of himself, and be able to control them, and use either trait when needed. One analogy: America has great big battleships and great big hospital ships. We send them out where each is needed. We are capable of great force and great compassion - the issue we have now is where to use what skill. We are coddling our enemies and pissing off our allies. OK, going off the rails. My point is having the skills of both, and being able to use each trait/skill/ability/behavior at the right place and time, is better than only having one or the other.

How he doesn't get pissy if I'm not up for sex, he's appreciative of having someone, if having ME, to sleep next to (I'm average libido, but I'll say no if something is legitimately a no - sickness,  extreme fatigue, blinding migraine etc).  He holds my hand and runs my back.  He's a bit feminine. He's thin and nerdy and well dressed and well spoken and stands with his hand on his hip (I think it's sexy). He isn't afraid to say he loves me and even though I don't know where he is right at this minute I KNOW he isn't out cheating or looking for another plate.  He's a truly nice guy.

He can love a rape survivor who was absolutely convinced there was a strong possibility she'd fall to pieces and possibility walk outside, light a cigarette and go non verbal for like 3 days with no warning. He just said ""All right. Walk me through worst case scenario. What should I and should I not do?"" He doesn't shy away if I'm crying over a deceased pet or a list friendship. He doesn't tell me to suck in up, he brings vodka and let's me get sloppy drunk and doesn't judge (not a regular thing - a drink to calm down turned into half the bottle... oops)  He'll tell a guy who was hassling me and then hands HIM ""I'm sorry, I didn't know she was with you"" that he isn't the one owed the apology.   He treats me like a person, a person he loves. It's ok for me to be vulnerable around him, or weak, because I know he'll hold me up. He feels comfortable being vulnerable around me.  That?

I am actually a former member of TRP and left because there was too much bad mixed in with the good. The good parts of TRP were self improvement, motivation and well, hitting the gym.

DeadBedrooms,3dq3un,NotHoldingMyBreath,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:50:50 2015 UTC,2 and a half.
DeadBedrooms,3dq3un,S-Words41k,4,Sat Jul 18 18:55:27 2015 UTC,"I could have almost written your post word for word, my story is very similar. Married at 18 because she was pregnant. Spent the next 12 years in a DB (3-4 times a year) whit many stretches of 6+ months in between. For a long time we pretty much just hated each other, but being military and having the kids kept things together. One day I just decided enough was enough and demanded we work on it or break up the family (3 kids at that point).    She agreed it was an issue and we needed work. IMO, SCHEDULED SEX WAS PRICELESS in fixing things in the beginning. We started having sex every Saturday night. But, it became stale. We were doing the same routine that we had all these years, just more often. Sex included all the work for me and almost never any foreplay for me. All in all we would be at it for an hour or so with me doing all the work to be able to get PIV. She didn't feel it was an issue because she was convinced that's how sex goes, the man spends all the time pleasuring her then climbs on for his reward. It was never star fish sex, but I just rarely even got touched. When it was clear that it would never change I cheated with a much younger woman. We met 3 times to exchange oral.    Ironically things got better when she inevitably found out, (they almost always do). She realized that it was important enough for my to risk the whole family to get what I needed. So she started giving more, and she found that she liked it. She now says she likes the feeling of pleasuring me as much as she likes receiving.    I also had to get rid of my ""nice guy"" tendencies. One I stopped letting her walk all over me and started taking what I want things were sooo much better. All those years when I would cater to her and give in to everything she wanted we both felt like she was more like my mother than my wife. She now respects me, which is what allows us to have an equal relationship.     Things are good. We have sex multiple times a week now and have discovered that we are both interested in swinging. We'll be visiting a lifestyle club in Vegas on our first ever trip alone in 18 years of marriage in a few weeks. We're both very excited.    I've posted my success story many times too, but it seems like the positive posts get drowned out here. Especially since the form got really popular a few months ago. Now it just seems that there are a bunch of bitter people giving bitter people bad advice. There are a few of use that chime in with level heads and good advice, but for the most part a lot of my comments are called red pill fantasy and dismissed.    I come here every so often in hopes that I can help someone like I was helped here. I was glad to see your post and a few other positives on this visit.     Thanks for sharing!"

Two (three) years of talking about and working the problem.  Fantasies yet nightmares about what might be otherwise.  Increasing my devotion to activities that I enjoy otherwise, and being a badass at some if I may say so myself, while still being as or more devoted as ever to her and home.  More or less regular (more or less scheduled) sex when we're together.  Yet there is...something...some je ne sais quoi that I feel is missing.  I'm just not getting that craving feeling you describe, at least not often.  Maybe it's there (she claims it is) and I'm just not attuned to it, but I feel like the action would come through differently if it was.  Damn, I should not have come here.

How the other person just doesn't know what the problem is so they can't just give you an answer, so you have to look for it together, over days and weeks and months and years. How you have to force yourself to remain cordial and empathetic and dispassionate, when all you really want to do is lash out. How you never get to have the moral high ground even when you feel you deserve it. How you have to teach yourself how to trust and let go, when every instinct tells you not to.   This.

DeadBedrooms,3dre0x,S-Words41k,8,Sat Jul 18 18:51:33 2015 UTC,lack of sex is the least of your issues
DeadBedrooms,3dre0x,LostinAlaska,4,Sat Jul 18 22:09:58 2015 UTC,"When I read your post it raised some red flags about how your spouse might be narcissistic. The two example classic tells were how each time you mention any trouble hers are ten times more, and how she gave you a big fight about how you dared to actually party when you went to a party, rather than pay attention to her needs at all times.  So maybe google around how to tell if your spouse is a narcissist for a few minutes, see around if any of those signs ring any bells to you (hint: you mentioned several explicitly in your post). I'm just a dude from the Interwebz, I know your story just from reading a few paragraphs on Reddit. I might be wrong, but I think this hypothesis might warrant a few minutes to look into.   I've been trying for 15 years to make this woman happy thinking that the next thing I do will FINALLY fix things and we'll be happy   Her mood is her own business. It's not your responsibility to make her happy. She's an adult.   I'm going to start being more selfish.   If my suspicion that your spouse is a narcissist is correct, expect extreme push-back on that. Narcissists thrive on getting attention and need a lot of that to get through with their lives. When you cut short the supply of that sweet sweet attention it is very likely that it will freak the shit out of your spouse.  Again, I'm just a dude from the Interwebz. I might be wrong, but if I'm right, knowing the proper adjective to describe the situation will save a lot of trouble."
DeadBedrooms,3dre0x,t_from_gdansk,3,Sun Jul 19 18:19:59 2015 UTC,Do you actually want sex? It feels like a relationship type of issue here rather than DB. I'm so confused. Can you go into the sex problems a bit more rather than the naggy wife issues? I might have some ideas if I knew what was going on in the bedroom.
DeadBedrooms,3dre0x,PushyBroad,2,Sat Jul 18 20:36:36 2015 UTC,"Ahh, sorry.....Well, I seemed to have doubled down on stupid.  Starting off, her mother passed away when she was young, step-mother was just a horrible human being that we don't even talk to her or her father any more.  So, the issues probably started there.  She grew up religious, spent a lot of time with her grandmother and in church.  She was a virgin when we met, took about 6 months before we had sex the first time.  She was cutesy/playful back then, but pretty walled off to any kind of experimentation.  Didn't shave, no oral, just missionary...and only in bed and after we've both showered.    Anyhow, after a while we had about a week where we had a lot of sex.  She told me that if she didn't give it to me she knew I'd find it elsewhere.  Then after that week we had about a 180.  Then I had to buy her a ring...so I did.  Then we had to get married....so I did.  Then she wanted a house....so we did.  Sex still few and far between during this time...then she wanted a kid.  So we had sex EVERY day.  It was great and all but it was purely reproductive, so almost like duty sex...but she wanted it.  So, we have the kid...I don't think we had sex that entire pregnancy.  After my son was born it took a while, but the slow rationing of sex started again.  Son has health issues, he winds up in bed with us, that didn't help anything, but honestly I don't think it really changed the frequency.    Now, at this point, I've caught on to her shirking responsibility.  Things like I'm doing diapers most of the time, getting up in the middle of the night, etc.  I don't want another kid, I tell her this, but she's got her mind made up that my son needs a sibling because of his health issues.  So, she goes back into the sex every day until we conceive, she gets her wish the first month.  Now...the only reason I get into this is because sex did change a little bit during this pregnancy (and a little prior to it).  She finally started trimming her pubic hair and  let me go down on her before it.  During the pregnancy she relented to 69.  Literally the first time she's done oral on me.  During this pregnancy we have sex more often than pretty much any time previously.  Still, not a ton, but a vast improvement over any prior time.  So, anyhow, we're now back to about once every 3 months.  I have a high libido.  Of course I want sex.  But everything has just worn me down."
DeadBedrooms,3dre0x,Ronaround808,3,Sat Jul 18 20:50:41 2015 UTC,Having sex with a woman that treats us like shit is a hard thing to do. I've been struggling with the same issues you've talked about.
DeadBedrooms,3dre0x,PushyBroad,2,Sat Jul 18 23:04:16 2015 UTC,I'm sorry this is happening to you. What happened before you got engaged/married that may have caused her to feel so insecure about your commitment to her?
DeadBedrooms,3dre0x,PushyBroad,2,Sat Jul 18 23:09:46 2015 UTC,"No idea, just impatient I guess.  We had been together for 3 years and she just started threatening to leave. In hindsight I should have let her go. ."
DeadBedrooms,3dre0x,PushyBroad,2,Sun Jul 19 00:36:59 2015 UTC,"This is a tough call. It's hard to believe a couple that's been together 15 years has just now had oral sex. What religion if you don't mind my asking? If it's something like mormonism or JW, you're screwed, as those are more the ""culty"" religions that brainwash people from childhood. If it's more a mainstream one, you might have an easier time helping her out of it.  You don't sound fulfilled, on the other hand you did marry her and now have basically 2 children together, so there must be attraction there. How forward are you about the problems and the things you want to do? Does your wife work? What is her love language? What is your love language? Can you open up a conversation about some of this so everyone is aware? Your love language may be a mix of touch and deeds it sounds to me from your posts.  My husband's love language is all over the board. He says he can't choose between any of the items. Whether that is because he wants it all or doesn't want it with me remains to be seen. However, if you and she take that quiz it will enlighten both of you as to what things you can do to show your love.  You married her once upon a time! Yes, you have done all the ""right"" things to show you are a ""nice guy,"" but have you truly put yourself out there emotionally? If you haven't, I wouldn't give up until you have tried that for a few months."

She's pretty much detached from church now.  We go occasionally...but she questions a lot of it now.    No, I'm not fulfilled.  Not even close.  I'm not terribly forward with my problems, but when I am I get them thrown back in my face and she always has it 1000 times worse or does so much more than me.  Yes, she does work.  I'm not really familiar with the whole love language thing, so I'm not sure.  I'm starting to tell her more about how I feel.  Especially after the wedding incident."
DeadBedrooms,3dre0x,PushyBroad,2,Sun Jul 19 04:16:31 2015 UTC,"That must have been kind of embarrassing. She does sound kind of frigid and may never change.   You keep saying sex is the problem, but each of your comments revolves around how much you ""do."" Does your wife not get up because she sleeps thru the kids crying? Mine are preschool age and after 4 years of parenting I frequently sleep thru their nighttime wake ups. My husband wakes up, and tends to them. My thought is, if I am sleeping thru it most nights I must be pretty dang tired and I'm ""doing"" all I can ""do."" If you have it in you to "" do more"" then more power to you. Can you let some things go? Does the 3 year old really need you to pat him back to sleep?  Have you hired some help to take the load off of you and your wife? We have had our neighbor's 11 year old mow for us this summer and dang if that isn't nice!"

At some point she just decided that getting up with the kids was my job because I ""fell back to sleep faster"".  Well, I fell back asleep faster because I'm fucking exhausted from getting up with the kids all the time.    Our son has medical needs that are kind of tricky to just dump on someone, so we can't just hire a babysitter.  My parents are pretty much the only people we trust to leave them with and they already watch them during the week.  I hate to ask them to do any more than they already do."

In an ideal situation, most or all of the love you need happens to be the stuff that comes naturally for him, and the love he needs is what comes naturally for you. In a very healthy, good relationship you may never notice or stop to think about it.  Sometimes that breaks down. In order to fix it, both of you have to acknowledge that it's a problem, both have to agree on the nature of the problem, and both have to be willing and able to work on it and produce results. All too often, probably most of the time, someone posting here (or some other relationship problem elsewhere) has a partner who does not acknowledge that it's a problem, does not agree to what type of problem it is, or is unwilling/unable to do the work."

Sounds like you need to decide what is best for you at this point since no solution may be the perfect one. Do you stay with someone you care about knowing you may not ever be satisfied sexually, or do you leave him and what you have already built so as to have a chance of finding more stimulation with a different partner? You care about him. Just a matter of what best works for you. Only you can answer this. That being said. If you do leave, do it for your own self.

What's just starting to work for me with my wife (though the issues are very different) is saying 'look, you say you want to us to work together to sort this out, but I don't see you actually doing anything, which makes me question your commitment. That makes me feel as insecure as fuck. You say you want me to feel better, and the one thing you can do now about that is let me know what you're trying, and how it's going.

When you drop all the hurt feelings and hateful words that you've absorbed when you've fought about sex, and when you've stopped allowing that single person's behavior to control your sense of well-being.   You just have to scrap it all, forgive and forget and start completely fresh. And you have to be honest one last time. ""I'm miserable here. I want to be with someone I can grab and kiss, someone I can have awesome sex with, someone who isn't a huge pain in the ass about sex. Someone fun and spontaneous. That used to be you. I miss the you I fell in love with. Hell, I miss the me you fell in love with. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to be that guy again. You can get on board or not, but I'm going to get my fun, rewarding life back.""   Then you split and you actually follow through. And you do that again the next day. And the next, one foot in front of the other. And you never, ever backslide or show that weakness that helped you both spiral down into a friendship.   You have to be strong enough to let it all go and muscle through the pain until there is no more pain. She's liable to push back hard, maybe even try to inflict some more pain just to maintain the status quo. People like the status quo. But it's no place to be so bust out of it like your ass is on fire.   Just live like you would if you were hoping to find someone new. If she's worth anything at all, she'll join you at some point. You can still be nice, be considerate, be loving and affectionate. You can still enjoy sitting on the couch and going for long rides and goofing around when the mood is right. But keep on growing until you are the person you were in the beginning, or even better than that guy."

Duty sex felt more awful than just not getting laid. I want someone who's enthusiastic to fuck me and who wants to explore kinks and have fun and not take it seriously, or I want no one at all (I can do that by myself). It's not just about orgasms, I can give myself orgasms. I wanted that experience with someone."
DeadBedrooms,3dnz0v,abcde123987,3,Sat Jul 18 05:37:05 2015 UTC,"Yep. Eventually I gave up trying to please her, then I gave up having sex with her. it was too hard to get and not worth getting. I want to make love with her, not on top of her, and she had become so inert and hard to crack that in the end she got what she wants- nothing at all and me earning money and helping raise the kids. You make your choice and I am sure she will be amazed when I leave her, even though we had the talk many times."

Yeah, my SO complained that the breakup was ""out of the blue,"" even though we'd had the talk many times, and a recent time was very ""if this isn't something we can work through, our relationship won't work out because I'm unhappy."" And we'd been fighting like crazy for weeks because she is also very high-strung, and takes her stress out on her partner. She said to me ""I thought we were just having a rough patch."" No, you were treating me like shit because of life circumstances outside of my control, for the nth time, and once my attraction and sexual connection to you finally withered and died so much that I didn't even want you to touch me anymore, it stopped being something I would put up with. I'd never stand a friend treating me that way, and we were basically just friends by the end. (FWIW I'll never stand a partner treating me that way again, either, but it was my first serious relationship. I have learned a lot.)  As for you, flatlining66, best of luck.

With my current DB, my partner enjoys sex whenever it happens. It just doesn't happen enough due to different priorities and interest levels. She has a refractory period (yes, I'm not using that word right, but it conveys what I mean) measured in days to weeks, mine is hours at most.   I have no idea what happens when the partner doesn't enjoy it at all."
DeadBedrooms,3dnz0v,marriedscoundrel,6,Fri Jul 17 20:47:37 2015 UTC,"It only gets ""fixed"" if one partner decides to change - the HL decides to sacrifice sex in order to be with the LL, or the LL changes themselves to get more of a mental/emotional reward from sex that better motivates them to want it.

DeadBedrooms,3dnz0v,grinningbeer,3,Fri Jul 17 22:05:24 2015 UTC,"I have seen someone lose his desire for sex for years because he assumed that it was normal to have a sexless marriage as that was all he knew. We've been back to our normal, which is 5 or 6 times per week, for more than a year now and he's shown no signs of getting bored.   There is a fomer LL poster here sometimes who never gave sex much thought until her marriage hit crisis mode in her mid 30s. She's a sex kitten now, huge advocate of exploration and experimentation. It happens."

DeadBedrooms,3dnz0v,grinningbeer,2,Fri Jul 17 23:16:57 2015 UTC,"I thought the qualifier I used ""our"" normal indicated a relative status. I didn't say anything about resolving our issue was simple, it took months of working our way back to one another. But I had to make it very clear that I was willing to change and willing to leave over the gulf between us if he didn't find his way back, too. No wavering, no crying, no backwards steps. Behaving as though rejection didn't still hurt was very hard and it took a lot of practice. He tested my resolve for quite a while before he had to admit that sex and affection was more fun thae splitting every time things grew cold or awkward. And I had to be the one to do all the emotional work, nearly all the initiating for a long time before he started believing in me and found me exciting again.   Nothing simple about it, it damn near broke me several times. But it was easier than divorce. And now I can safely say we're a team again and crazy about one another."

DeadBedrooms,3dnz0v,cincofone,0,Fri Jul 17 23:38:46 2015 UTC,My hope is that there is some issue that has shut down the desire that we can work through in counseling. Once we're on the same page again we could work on rekindling the feelings.   That's my hope. I don't know if it's realistic our if it even makes any sense.  My bad mood this moment reminiscing on when me and my man first met makes me very skeptical and a little bit despairing.

DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,horses_and_flowers,49,Fri Jul 17 15:53:09 2015 UTC,"I had sex about 3 times a year for 4 years. I came here, read several dozen posts and hundreds of comments on having the talk.   3+ months ago, I had the talk with her. No accusations, I asked if she was still attracted to me, said I felt lost and unattractive, not desired and asked if it was something I did or something we are failing to do. She was mortified. She had no clue it was that bad.   She said we had sex like every week, I pointed out the last 3 times and she realized the last one was about 8 months prior.  She asked if I wanted to leave her, I told her that wasn't on the table currently. I wanted things better.   She had neglected me because she was busy and I was so good at helping her she simply had put our intimacy on the back burner.   So we have worked on it and the last 3 times have all been initiated by her with her saying things like ""wake me up, I may be tired, but I really want some cock tonight."" And once we were just cuddling and next thing you know her hand is on my cock and she is whispering in my ear ""let's go to the other room, I want you in me, now.""  I was lucky, she wanted to save the relationship, isn't making excuses and we are working hard to be a couple. We were always loving, that had just fallen by the wayside. It no longer is.   If your partner is not willing to work at it, I think you may need to reevaluate your current life. Be happy. Leave if need be. It may not be something that can be fixed. If they say they are, and actually put in the effort, it is possible.   There is hope."

If they don't and you know it, it isn't a couple anymore. Your spouse is paying lip service to shut you up, but not following through or doing what will actually help?  Why stay?  It is worse than saying they are done. They are stringing you along.   Give yourself a deadline. If they can't make tangible and obvious progress to an outsider, then walk away. View it as proof that it wasn't that important to them and find someone for whom it will be."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,grinningbeer,36,Tue Jul 21 21:13:35 2015 UTC,Yes. The people who discourage you the most are still in their dead bedrooms and lashing out by sending negative messages into the ether. Ignore the lifers. Good things can happen if you both make positive changes.
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,jakabab,17,Fri Jul 17 16:03:20 2015 UTC,"I needed to read this.   Essentially all the feedback I got about my DB was ""well he clearly just isn't into you anymore"" which has really been.. stuck in my head the last few days..."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,grinningbeer,4,Fri Jul 17 19:29:49 2015 UTC,"Never start with the worst case scenario. That will make you approach him with the expectation that he'll reject you, and you can guarantee the outcome. Start right now and go after what you want with a smile on your face and gums blazing. If he doesn't notice, you can bet someone else will. He does not define you."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,jakabab,5,Fri Jul 17 19:32:23 2015 UTC,"I know he doesn't. I also came to the realization that I perpetuate the negativity and am a huge part of the problem. He is the one I want to be with though and he constantly is telling me how beautiful he finds me, how much he loves me, and how he wants to be with me..  so to come on here in search of reasoning and just be shot down with ""he just doesn't want you"" was really, really rough.."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,grinningbeer,5,Fri Jul 17 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"And the people who say that have a different definition for themselves. That is mean-spirited advice and I'm sorry that's what you found here. It is possible that some people lose attraction, but you cannot know if that is the problem until you feel comfortable and attractive again. You have to start from your best You before you can solve a relationship problem. Pick yourself up and go do whatever makes you feel great and go get a hug. And keep doing what makes you feel good and keep working on physical affection and a sexy, positive attitude until you feel like yourself again."

It came back to a degree that most could classify as normal.   I have a different situation now I'm working through, but I know success is possible at least sometimes."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,TexasVendee,7,Fri Jul 17 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"This is one of those hotly debated topics here. First off there are really any success stories, but that could be because once things get better no one wants to go back here and be reminded of things.    Personally if things got better I would never come back, shit I can only stand popping in for a few days every couple weeks. When I start reading to much and committing I just spiral and get depressed."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,grinningbeer,5,Fri Jul 17 18:07:21 2015 UTC,"That's the main problem with what could be a very supportive and helpful environment. The lead players here have terrible marriages yet spend all their time dishing out negative advice they won't take themselves. You can stay away from here six months and come back to the same people with the same complaints. It's so depressing to see the same people circling the drain that it's hard to ask for help or offer any insight. I used to enjoy the positive Sunday posts, but those are anemic now, too. I think everyone who has done anything worthy of sharing just gives up and walks away and leaves it to the lowest common denominator.   I hate it for all the new people who wander in here, because the moderation beats every other sub on reddit."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,anonbonbon,7,Fri Jul 17 21:11:11 2015 UTC,"Mine did. It was caused by a combo of weight gain causing bad hormonal changes, painful sex due to physical issues, and (the biggest thing) a general early 20s sense of being lost and unmoored and just totally unable to fix my problems. Once I started fixing them (losing weight, gaining some direction and purpose in my life), things got better. Then I had a baby and the physical and hormonal changes afterwards had an unusually positive effect on me, and things really got better. So, they certainly can.   For me, it was never about being low libido, or uninterested in sex. It was that my body had gotten all messed up and I didn't yet know how to fix it. I always wanted to be someone for whom sex was easy, and that was a big motivating factor in making changes to make that happen. So yeah, I think in a lot of cases, fixing it is possible. If both people really want to."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,myrrar,13,Fri Jul 17 22:31:22 2015 UTC,"If you fix the root of the problem, yes.   I've been with my boyfriend 10 years, and was the LL starting about 5 years in. It only got worse as it went but since I was the LL so it never bothered me. We were teenagers when we started dating so I also thought sex dying off was pretty normal. When I finally decided our DB was ruining our relationship I decided to try and fix it. We did, and we've had a healthy sex life for over a year now. I'm not giving him pity sex or just doing it to do it because I know I should. We fixed the problem. We're both on the same page and all resentment and issues we had with our DB are gone. It's kind of like losing weight. If you do temp fixes and diets they aren't going to last, you have to completely change your lifestyle and how you do things.  Reading the posts on here, most of the time the LL doesn't see the problem or isn't willing to change, and a lot of the time the HLs aren't truly willing to put in equal effort.   Most people have a really skewed idea of what causes DBs and approach the problem in realllly bad ways. If both parties can get on the same page and both truly want to fix the real issue, DBs can absolutely bounce back. I imagine most of the people on here aren't seeing bounce backs because they're the HLs. If the LL isn't the one wanting to change nothing you do will change them."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,NotHoldingMyBreath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:54 2015 UTC,a lot of the time the HLs aren't truly willing to put in equal effort.   Genuine question: what would you see as equal effort?
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,myrrar,11,Fri Jul 17 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the time, honestly a majority of the time, LLs aren't just LL. It's not a 100% no libido issue. HLs post about how they ask and ask and ask and do nice things for their SOs hoping for sex in return and things like that. That doesn't work. That only builds resentment.   It makes LLs feel like all you want from them is sex, you only do nice things for them to get sex, every time you get close to them you want sex from them. A lot of people talk about how their SOs don't even want to kiss or be touched. Most of the time that's not because they're unattracted to them, it's because they resent them.  To me, equal effort would be sitting down and talking about the issue, and truly addressing the problems both people have. It's obvious most HLs on here want to fix their DBs but shockingly talking to their SO and truly explaining how hurt they are by rejection and that they are willing to put in the effort is just too much work. Way easier to push and push then whine when that's not working. Maybe I'm just seeing the drama mamas because they're the posts that get the highest but it seems like 9/10 posts I read the HL keeps doing the things that have never worked and complain about it instead of changing their strategy and just talking, then moving from there."

DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,Modevs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:26:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know about others, but for me it's tough because she always seems to find a way to turn things over on me - not that I can blame her for being defensive - and I end up feeling guilty.  It sucks when someone makes you feel bad for your own feelings and it just makes me resent her and makes the idea of trying again very unappealing.  I've tried very hard to impress on her the importance of sex in my life in an honest way but rather than inspiring any kind of change it feels like she's just built an immunity to anything I could say or do that might fix this rut we're in.  To an extent I can't even entirely blame her. I know I haven't done the best job communicating or being positive but at this point it just feels like entropy has gotten the better of me and I feel like even though I hate where I am at least I can sit here and even though I feel alone and miserable most days it's quiet and at least nobody bothers me.  I look inside myself and try to find the energy to be positive, but I've spent so long in this circle of thinking if I can find a way to meet her needs she'll appreciate my efforts and want to meet mine so we can both be happy that I just don't have the strength anymore to get myself out of this rut and make a positive change.  I hate it as much as she does, but I don't know what to do. If I could flip a switch and never want sex again I would in a heartbeat.  I don't even remember what point I was trying to make anymore..."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,myrrar,2,Mon Jul 20 03:37:49 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion, but I think if you have truly communicated about how much sex with her is important to you, you're hurt and are willing to do whatever it takes to fix it and she's still not interested, you've done all you can do.  It kind of backs you into a corner. If you try and change on your own(do nice things for her, be close to her without it being about sex, all the things she probably wants) she'll probably feel like you're just doing it for sex and to manipulate the situation. If you keep talking she'll feel nagged.   I think since most LLs just don't have a libido for whatever reason they just really don't care about fixing the problem. Why would they. You know it hurts your partner but you vilify them in your own head. Why is it alllllways about sex with them. They don't love and respect me they just want to get laid. I think the main thing is too, why should I compromise. I hate sex, they like it, why should I do something I hate to please them. They don't even realize you have already been compromising by cutting down your sex life so much.  Sex is one of those weird things that is really necessary for healthy close relationships but is easily twisted into a bad thing. As a girl you have people squawking at you all your life that sex is bad. Sex shouldn't be important. Not having sex with your husband is completely normal. If the man wants to get laid all the time he probably has a sex or porn addiction.   I know for a lot of LLs couples therapy has been great. It really showed them more about their partners and made them realize how bad DBs really are. I really hope it gets better for you both, I know what it's like to love your SO desperately but deeply resent them at the same time."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,Modevs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:18:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate your perspective.  Maybe therapy would help; sometimes it just feels good to vent without being so concerned about being judged by or hurting your SO.  In the past she's made it clear she wont go to therapy because she thinks her personal life is none of some stranger's business, but we could probably use a more objective opinion."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,Spongeytwo,-3,Tue Jul 21 01:43:13 2015 UTC,"So they're not putting in equal effort, they're putting in more effort?"
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,grinningbeer,2,Sat Jul 18 01:34:22 2015 UTC,"I believe she's stating the they attempt to manipulate and obligate the LL to perform rather than admitting openly that they want more sex. No one wants to be managed in such a way. Not at work, not by peers, and certainly not at home.  Count the posts which begin ""How do I tell my partner I'm not getting enough sex"". It seems that most people aren't direct and instead try to coax sex out of the denying partner by micromanagement and hovering."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,Spongeytwo,-1,Sat Jul 18 04:04:17 2015 UTC,"Trying to get your SO to want to have sex with you more, that's almost criminal!"
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,grinningbeer,2,Sat Jul 18 04:43:07 2015 UTC,"Does manipulation work on you? If you want your oil changed, do you clean your mechanic's parking lot and hope he gets ir or gives in out of a sense of obligation, or do you ask your mechanic to change your oil? How could you possibly think that working someone is better than expressing your desire directly?"
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,NotHoldingMyBreath,0,Sat Jul 18 10:00:11 2015 UTC,"Two reasons for not just saying directly 'I want us to have more sex': the LL often doesn't hear the 'us'. They hear 'you are just a hole/dildo to me'; and secondly, the HL doesn't just want more sex. They want more sex with their partner. LL's truly don't understand why this is important, just as HLs don't understand how sex with your SO can not be important."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,grinningbeer,2,Sat Jul 18 12:10:45 2015 UTC,"How can you defend not being honest and upfront about what sex with your partner means to you? Do you have a proven method of tricking sex out of them? Honesty is the only way to go, anything less and you drive an even bigger wedge between you.   If the lack of physical intimacy is making you miserable, the person who loves you should want to work with you to find a compromise, if she doesnt, why are you with her? You can use the opportunity to ask what she needs to feel happy and loved and ask if you can do more for her, too."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,myrrar,2,Sat Jul 18 14:38:17 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why having a real discussion about it is so important. I felt like my bf just wanted to get laid. It had nothing to do with me, he was loyal and I was his SO and that's why he bothered me all the time. But it wasn't me he wanted, it was sex.   He would tell me he wanted to have sex more and that he didn't like having a DB but not the reasons behind it. When someone is constantly nagging you and you feel like they're manipulating you you don't want to compromise. You don't want to fix the issue.  If you sit down and truly tell your SO how bad a sexless relationship makes you feel, the reasons you want to be intimate, and that you are willing to do whatever it takes to fix the situation and they still have no interest you either need to accept the DB or move on. They aren't willing to change even though they clearly know it hurts you.  You're right, I think a lot of LLs don't see it as a big deal. Most probably don't know why they're LL but since they aren't having the urges there's no reason to change. If they love you they will be willing to work on the relationship no matter what the problem is, sex included. The main issue is most people think sexless marriages is the norm, and a SO that wants constant sex is expecting too much, or a sex addict, or cares more about sex than the emotional bond. Especially if the female is the LL.  It's just something you have to both be willing to work through. Communication is key."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,NotHoldingMyBreath,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:54:39 2015 UTC,"It cuts both ways though. There are plenty of posts where the HL has said 'I'm hurting' and the LL has said 'deal with it' because they've clearly just heard 'I want sex', not 'I want sex with you', and feel hurt. Or, they feel hurt when the HL says 'your actions are hurting me', and close down.  I'm not saying 'lie' - I'm saying communication from the HL has to be handled in such a way the LL doesn't close down, and sometimes that involves not slapping the whole thing on the table in one go, and thinking about how they'll hear it.  Managers do this all the time at work. The commonest one is the 'praise sandwich', widely taught as a feedback technique. If you're going to tell an employee something they'll feel as criticism, put it between two positives, so they're more receptive."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,FOLLWTHEWHITERABBIT,5,Sat Jul 18 15:46:19 2015 UTC,Yes.  Mine has.
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,Esteesmithrowaway,4,Fri Jul 17 19:48:19 2015 UTC,"Mine did. I think about it a lot and I think it helps if, at its core, you communicate well in your relationship. (Even if you don't communicate well about sex.)  When we were first married we always had weekly sex but it slowly devolved to sex every two weeks then monthly etc. The last three years we were down to 2-3 times a year.  I know he wanted more but I wasn't really focused on making sex important. I always put it off if I was tired or busy.  And then so much time passed that I didn't know how to initiate and neither did he. Until one night, in the dark, as we lay in bed I told him we were too young (we are in our early and mid 40's) to have such a screwed up sex life. He agreed. And from them on I started to ask him if he wanted to have sex. He would initiate more confidently and because we were trying to fix this situation I would always agree.  But eventually, I wanted to agree. (He got really good at it.) Our sex life is amazing  right now better than it was when we were first married or dating.  We are up to having sex around 4-5 times a week and we are always trying new things.  We even took a class on kink together. We read books about erotica and sex techniques together.  I'd say it took a year of working on it and now sex is naturally part of our marriage. I'm so happy and grateful that this happened because I honestly thought we were destined to have a dry sexless marriage until one of died or got frustrated enough to leave.  I also think you need to be willing to stop watching tv or whatever is keeping you from putting in the time with your SO. We cancelled cable. I've never watched Game of Thrones and its totally worth it."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,mysexrdtaccouint2014,3,Sat Jul 18 00:27:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's awesome. I admire the way you both handled it. Seems like you were both ready to work on it. That's a great story. Good job on adding sex back into your lives and doing so in a fun way."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,NotHoldingMyBreath,9,Sat Jul 18 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"There can be hope. I spent the first 12 years of my marriage in a DB, 3-4 times a year, once with a 9 month stretch, and now we are very happy and very sexually active. But it honestly depends on both parties.    I don't have your story so I can't really make any suggestions, but the first step is to be sure your SO knows this is an issue.    And in my personal experience, some SOs will NEVER change until they know the relationship is on the line, for real. I see so many people post here that leaving or cheating isn't an option...so why would their SO change? They have what they want, a dedicated SO what won't leave them over the lack of sex.    So without any back story my only advice is to talk to your SO about it if you haven't and make it clear that not fixing it could be the end. Work out with yourself what you need/want and make that clear to your SO. If they are unresponsive, make clear goals with timelines and consequences and follow through. I don't mean be petty, like if I don't get a BJ I won't clean up, but milestones that your SO can use to show progress towards fixing it. Like, you need to be responsive to the majority of my advances up to X amount of times a week by the next 2 months, then we should evaluate where we're at, and if there is no progress then you should see a doctor about your lack of desire.    BUT, threatening to leave over it out of the blue is not going to work. You have to talk about it first and make sure your SO knows its an issue they need to work on.     Only you can know what would be acceptable in your relationship.    There is hope!!! If you want more direct advice on your situation you'll have to give a good background."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,mysexrdtaccouint2014,2,Fri Jul 17 16:40:48 2015 UTC,make clear goals with timelines and consequences and follow through   Why do you think that worked in your case? I can only imagine it building resentment.
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,NotHoldingMyBreath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"This worked in my case because she was willing to fix things. I didn't play it out as well as I suggest here, but we have talked about those years of fixing it and she agrees that had I given more clear goals like that with reasonable time lines that she would have done better at meeting my needs.    I think too often when a couple decides to fix the DB the HL person expects things to happen over night and it overwhelms the ""LL"" person. We agree that this system would have taken weight off both our shoulders in those years.    And obviously ever DB and couple is unique so this won't work for everyone."

I think it will be for me,  but not yet because of our dog. He's in his golden year (years) and I really want his last year to be as awesome as possible, which means staying here with his dad (my husband) and our yard. But after that, I am not sure. Not easy to really leave the person you want to be with the most, but, who wants to live a frustrated life full of longing. The idea of milestones so far annoys him, so I kinda just have to have my own internal ones for now, and for the rest of my dog's life."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,bakkasan,3,Fri Jul 17 20:30:06 2015 UTC,"Speaking from experience it does/can get better. It took a lot of awkward and difficult conversations but our sex life is much healthier than it used to be. We went from once every two or three months up to a few times a week.   We had to work on our communication skills. It was difficult for me to explain how much of a problem it was and it was hard for her to communicate what her hang ups were.  I think the situation really hit home for her when I said:"" I'm in a really vulnerable position here. What I mean is I can go and hang out with friends when I'm lonely, when I'm bored I can go for a bike ride, I can cook  for myself and pretty much take care of all my needs on my own more or less. Except for two things - intimacy and sex which is something I cant/shouldn't go out and get for myself. If it wouldn't make me a douchebag I would walk out that door get some and leave you alone (in the pestering/annoying sense). I depend on you for intimacy and sex, I need much more then I'm getting."""
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,rizzdizzle,3,Sat Jul 18 00:06:50 2015 UTC,"Your woman is lucky if you feel you need her for intimacy. I wish my husband felt that way. He doesn't need me for anything, well, except a blowjob, he can't do that to himself. You wanting your SO to satisfy your need for intimacy and sex is a luxury for her, and I hope she figures that out before you go somewhere else or just shut off completely."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,jakabab,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:46:09 2015 UTC,"She definitely does feel lucky to have a husband who wants her like crazy but, for various reasons sex can be hard for her. Which in turn means that my desire can be as much a source of frustration and guilt as it is reassuring or provocative.  I'd like to reiterate we're mostly past the DB issues. She does her best to meet my needs while providing reassurance when she can't and I do my best to be patient and flexible.  I can't stress enough that with: communication, honesty, bucket loads of empathy and last but not least effort on both sides there are few problems IMHO a couple can't figure out."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,jakabab,5,Sat Jul 18 15:44:53 2015 UTC,Mine has. I still have issues with it that I am seeing a therapist over but my wife has been a stellar turnaround. It only took telling her I was going to cheat or leave to get her attention. Only... Which is why I am in therapy.
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,Redshoe9,3,Fri Jul 17 17:28:21 2015 UTC,"I think it will depend on two things, if resentment has formed and cannot be moved past, and continued effort on both partners parts. But there's a chance the HL is never going to be satisfied, so it depends if the HL will be content because odds are the LL will continue to be lower no matter how much improvement is made."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,jakabab,2,Fri Jul 17 19:10:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, the question of whether the HL, or even if it's not libido per se, just the one wanting to make love, can be satisfied in a non-sexual relationship. It seems like the LL has it easier; he or she is not holding himself back, restraining urges and feeling rejected."
DeadBedrooms,3dmwo3,jakabab,3,Fri Jul 17 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you all for so many thoughtful and hopeful posts. There are so many good points here that I can't address them all. I just really appreciate it. Mrdoe, you said that basically the whole thing rests with the HL, and that is what it seems, and that is frustrating, discouraging, and for me, builds resentment. My husband is the one who doesn't want sex, and it gives him more power in the relationship. He controls when, or if, we have sex, and it gives me mental anguish and it also builds resentment. Jakabab, you said your SO is the one you want to be with, and that is true for me also. He's the one I find most attractive in the world, except for a few movie stars. Other guys don't compare to him in my eyes. I hate wanting his body and knowing he doesn't want mine. He prefers his hand to me. He much prefers his hand - his right hand is my competition. I did not think I'd end up this way."

And I have two sex toys that I hide from him because it's embarrassing. I have a hot guy next to me in bed that is just not interested in me. But, I'm going to believe there's hope.

She is doing the best work on this very topic.  Check out her book mating in captivity as well.     Her theory is that desire needs space a bridge to cross....that couples shouldn't be so intertwined and meshed or the lovers become more like family.      There is something going on within him and you can't blame yourself.  There could be multiple reasons for the lack of sex.   Does he masterbate or have any sex desires that he hasnt shared with you?

Yes, he masturbates at least a couple of times a week. I don't know if he has other unshared desires. He's not as open-verbal as he thinks he is about sex. He gets a little defensive. It's hard not to blame myself (or yourself, the generic ""yourself"").

I prob wouldn't want to make those ""jokes"" if we were making love, sex, more often.

It went downhill from there. It's ""I'm stressed, I've gained weight and don't like my body. Why do you have such an emphasis on sex? Why is it so important to you?"" Then he became insecure. The sex got plainer, shorter, rarer. Then we stopped partying and drinking a bit. He would get drunk and get.. Bad. It's been a whirlwind but.... Idk working it out seems worth it. I've given him openings to leave, I've tried to leave him before.. He loves me, I believe that. He wants me, I believe that. He's made it clear in other ways.

Since you are probably one of the few people in the entire world that knows this guy and how he thinks and how he might react, you are the person to figure out how to talk with him. Does he like the bandages ripped off quickly, or swabbed with a little solvent to loosen the adhesive? Does he need to come to the conclusions himself through your guidance or does he need it slapped in his face? My philosophy is be gentle but firm and be clear. Communicate your needs clearly. Leave no doubt.  IF he loves you, IF you are the most important person in his life, he will do this for you. IF you are not, he will not. Isn't it that simple?

What should always be most important is the fun you have with one another. Try edging and extending perhaps on your end. In order to try lasting a little longer, I mean. I speak of this from personal experience. The anticipation and build-up have the tendency to make it better for you. Plus, she will not have to ever feel rushed. Personally, I think that cumming at the same time can be rather hot."

Talk to her about expectations and either reset your own or talk about the consequences of not meeting them. You should have had that conversation before you got married, to be honest.

I'd rather just work on things on my end.   Talk to her about expectations and either reset your own or talk about the consequences of not meeting them. You should have had that conversation before you got married, to be honest.   We did have this conversation. As I said to another poster, it just wasn't a dealbreaker for me. She knows what I'm expecting and we're both trying to compromise. Honestly just a little more than what I've been getting would make me a lot happier. I'm not looking for my wife to turn into a porn star overnight (or ever, really).   Therapy seems an odd choice to me personally given the lack of an obvious, concrete problem.

Odds are this is only gonna get worse over time.  Sad truth is, there is nothing you can do. She is who she is, and seems to have communicated this clearly.  Your only real options are to accept it or reconsider the marriage.  You are within your rights to sit down with her, lay things out in plain English.

DeadBedrooms,3dohxh,doglover1962,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:37:32 2015 UTC,I can definitely understand that affecting her libido   People who want to have sex find ways to make it happen regardless of their situation in life. in reality your living situation has nothing to do with her libido or lack of it.
DeadBedrooms,3dohxh,MeCruiser,2,Sun Jul 19 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"At the risk of sounding dismissive, I don't think you're anywhere close to a DB if you're experiencing sex at this frequency. Even at age 29 2--3 times a week under good circumstances and every other week under ""bad"" circumstances is about normal.   Here's reality for everyone: moving causes stress. Stress gets in the way of sex. Relax a bit, plan out a stress-free get-away, and get your groove on!  As for fantasizing about other women... you're only human. Your right hand has not ceased to function. Do what you must, and don't be ashamed!  As for actual cheating... don't do it. If you're serious about your SO emotionally I'd reserve other women for a true DB -- i.e. no sex in a year, lots of attempts at counseling, both partners are mutually apathetic, ready to move on in an open marriage or separation."
DeadBedrooms,3dohxh,abcde123987,3,Sat Jul 18 04:05:56 2015 UTC,"You married her knowing she has a lower sex drive than you, so you have to live with it. Did you think it would increase when you got married?  It sounds like she is very stressed right now which is affecting her sex drive, so wait until she moves to be with you and get settled and then odds her desire for sex will improve.  The odds are if you aren't having a good sex life while you are dating you aren't going to have a good sex life when you are married and add in other stresses like money, work, children, bills and in laws and the amount of sex you are getting usually decreases."

DeadBedrooms,3dms2i,Lost-In_My-Mind,5,Fri Jul 17 15:17:18 2015 UTC,"I have no desire to leave her but I also just no longer desire sex with her... Thoughts?   My initial thought was to ask why you choose to remain with her. I'm not trying to be abrupt or snarky. I'm guessing you have some feelings for her and that the balance of your relationship is comfortable. Have you discussed this with her? If so, what was her response?  If my math is correct, you were 16 and she was 15 when you guys got together. Neither of you are kids anymore, and you've probably grown into different people. Sometimes people grow together, other times they grow apart. I don't know where you two are on that path.  You say she's changing, but now you seldom desire sex with her. If you've reached the point where you're feeling indifferent toward her, you both might need to discuss if you want to continue the relationship. In an ideal relationship, you'd both have comfort and passion. It sounds like you have the comfort, but not the passion.  Do some talking and soul-searching with her."
DeadBedrooms,3dms2i,FulminateOfMercury,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:37:22 2015 UTC,I love her and don't really ever consider leaving her.

Perhaps if she continues to change your desire for her will reawaken? Would counseling help the two of you reconnect?   Starting over with someone else would mean all those years wasted away for nothing.   There's nothing wrong with trying to fix your relationship. Having a shared past with someone can be a powerful force. Just be realistic with yourself about wasting the many years you have in your future. You're both very young and hopefully have many years ahead of you. Try to make them as happy as you can.  I wish you well."

One of the reasons people here always cite about leaving is how bad it will be for all of their financial dreams if their wife takes them for a huge alimony settlement or something. You're already paying that price and you're also not allowed to have sex.   I don't even buy the excuse of staying together for the kids because your kids will at least have a chance of having one happy parent if you're getting laid in a healthier relationship.

Not that we no longer have sex, she washes her own laundry, she cooks dinner most nights, the kitchen sink is free of dishes at bedtime, and she no longer falls asleep putting our now 11 year old to bed. There's just no sex and we sleep in different rooms.  After over 9 months of no sex, all that work just for obligatory sex just doesn't seem worth it now.   I still cook a few nights a week, not as good as before though, I clean up, I wash my clothes (not hers), and I still pull my weight. It's just nothing like it was before. Its equal.

Along the lines of, well you can have a fulfilling relationship without a full sex life, if you're okay with that.  It sucks.

My ll wife likes oral sex but won't do it unless she has just showered (personally I don't care but she is self conscious).  In the middle of my DB i was asking her to shower in the evening and still getting shot down. Earlier in the relationship she'd be in the shower in a heartbeat. Once she is showered she loves it and it evolves into a long session for us both.  But she couldn't be bothered showering 'just for me'.  If a friend was coming over she wouldn't meet them unshowered and messy but it was too much trouble for me.  It isn't too much trouble now, apparently, all it took for me was to start packing a bag and saying we needed a break.  Don't let your relationship get the point where you only exert effort because he has shown a will to leave.  BTW coaxing foreplay isn't asking too much.  If you want oral, fingering, a massage or whatever as the primer to sex: asking for it isn't selfish.  If he objects he is probably a little selfish in bed and that needs to change on his end if he is to expect a lot of sex.  It is a 2 person game."

I would highly suggest looking into seeing a sex therapist. When I started therapy in April of this year, I was only comfortable with brief kisses from my husband, and minimal physical contact. In the past 3.5 months, I have progressed to being comfortable with nudity, extended periods of making out, and all types of intimate touch, including the genitals. For the first time in 4 years, I craved my husband's touch! I know I still have a way to go, but the progress (however slow it may seem) makes me extremely happy and optimistic. Therapy has helped me to understand the cause of my low libido, and address each issue one at a time in a way that I feel comfortable and safe. I highly recommend visiting a sex therapist and seeing if you can make any progress. Good luck!"

I was beginning to feel that what I wanted, what I needed, what I felt, was not important to you.  And how could you love me if I was unimportant to you.  But, the fact that you are asking this, tells me we can work this out together.  Dealing with simple motivation issues, I read that we can't wait to 'feel like doing something' we have to get up and start doing it.  Many woman say they do enjoy sex after they get started, so they found that just getting started was a big help to wanting it and enjoying it.  Don't make him always have to coax you. You initiate half the time.  If you do start and feel miserable, does it never feel good or pleasurable?  Are you having orgasims? What can we do to make it feel good and not miserable? Is it just the attitudes getting in the way or are the physical sensations unpleasant?  It's like saying I have to force myself to eat pizza.  It should be a pleasurable experience. Why are you having to force yourself to do something pleasurable? Is he not doing something that would make it pleasurable for you, or doing something that makes it uncomfortable?  Let's get specific.  I mean is he just giving you 2 minutes of rough boobage action then thrusting in? Is he spending the time necessary to get things lubricated? Is your brain getting in the way? (Are you Catholic? kidding) Do you masturbate? If you never feel good, that's a different discussion.  If you continue like this, you will drive a wedge, yes.  So, deal with it now before it becomes a bigger problem between you two.  This is a great first step, good for you!"

DeadBedrooms,3djn7h,LostinAlaska,2,Fri Jul 17 20:32:30 2015 UTC,"I know it's a problem for him.   It's not a problem for you. You will continue to fail for as long as you do not see it as a problem for you. Maybe it is time for you to take ownership of this issue. The fact that you are not seeking pleasure for yourself is a very bad sign. You've allowed yourself to become dead inside, but you don't see that, and you only worry about him being sad about you being dead inside. You feel compassionate to him, want him to be happy, but you have zero compassion to yourself. Refusing to give pleasure to yourself is a type of cruelty you are doing to yourself, but it is spilling over to him. Stop denying yourself pleasure, because it is destroying your relationship.   I don't know what I can do to make things better for him   Have sex with him and feel pleasure for yourself from that. Obviously. And you know it perfectly well. The way you pretend not to know that is really disgusting. Sorry, someone has to tell you exactly how unconvincing and hypocritical your ""not knowing what to do"" is. Just do it!.   Is there any advice any of you could offer?   Yes. Learn to love and enjoy sex for you. Unless you bring yourself to enjoy sex for you, you'll never be successful. If you cannot or do not want to learn to enjoy sex for you, then the least you can do is be a decent person and leave him so he has a chance to be with someone who wants to enjoy herself with him.  If you don't want to enjoy yourself with your man, give him the freedom to be with someone who does. We have a saying in my country - it translates as ""The willing find a way, the unwilling find excuses"". ""I want to but I can't"" - is this a way or is it an excuse?  Because your efforts are never going to be good enough if they are only done for him. If you refuse to seek physical pleasure for yourself, you will remain incapable of giving him pleasure. Learn to enjoy your own body.  And now you know exactly what to do - learn to enjoy sex with him or have the decency to set him free so he can be with someone who knows that her own pleasure is of value. Question is - will you continue to claim you're at a loss even after I laid out exactly what you can do."

You meant ""HL"" instead of ""NL"", which usually means ""no libido"".  Note that the H in HL actually means ""higher"".   Some tips:   Masturbate.  Men who masturbate tend to want sex less, but women who masturbate tend to want it more. Be mindful of the effect that a DB has on the HL partner's self esteem.  You can mitigate this while you're working on things by giving other kinds of affection and attention.  Make him feel loved. But stop feeling guilty.  Look into ""responsive desire.""

But you were 17 and 16 when you got together and it sounds like the upheaval in your own family drove you to bond with hers.  It's totally natural but it also makes it hard to determine where the bond with your SO stops and the bond with her family starts which isn't a very strong boundary.    Hopefully your ex's relationship with them is strong because she's going to need them now.  Perhaps a very brief call to her family to express your gratitude for being there for you and regret that things didn't work out.  Be prepared for some anger, obviously.  If you want that relationship to ever gel into something healthy post-healing then insist that you feel horrible but you'll be OK and your ex needs their support now.  Then go no contact for the foreseeable future.  If you do still care for your ex that's the only right thing to do.  As for your own life going forward you just freed up an enormous amount of time.  Maybe a short term second job to get your head above water and then onto dry land.  After that, school if you haven't already gone that route.  Even if you have...see what else is available.

They will repeat the same questions over and over, not remembering the answer they heard 30 seconds ago. This may go on for several hours.

The LL will often respond with ""We have sex all the time"" or ""We had sex just last week"".    LLs often actually believe, I feel, that they are having sex frequently and that the last sexual encounter, which may have occurred months ago, happened just a few days to a week ago.  Memory is a weird thing that way.  People can sometimes think something happened very recently, when it was actually quite a bit ago.  She may well be thinking that the BJ you got at Christmas was just last week, because that is about how often she thinks about sex: next to never.  You, on the other hand, think about sex all the time, and are very, very aware when the last BJ was.  So yes, she might be knowingly gaslighting you.  She might also be simply unaware of her own error. My guess is she knows it has been longer, but is not really aware of just how long.

DeadBedrooms,3dgbzm,toperuse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:39:23 2015 UTC,"According to the 'L Word', that can happen. Perhaps dirtydreamnumbertwo's anecdote is not the only example of it happening."
DeadBedrooms,3dgbzm,Geney,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:19:17 2015 UTC,"This thread is a great example of the one thing I really don't like about DB. We hear stories of how LLs cause trouble one way or another by not being intimate enough.   There are 14 responses before mine. One of them is ""yeah that could happen"", one of them is ""your wife is lying, but it's not impossible"", 2 don't express an opinion and the other 10 are some form of ""bullshit, your wife is Lady Macbeth"" The responses to this guy paint the woman as Lady MacBeth. That is one possible cause.   The lack of seeing issues from the LL's point of view is a MAJOR shortcoming to DB. How many of you have ever tried to honestly express your complaint through the eyes of your LL?   I get that frustration and neglect make it really hard to do so, but some LLs are not villains.    Imagine instead the post was: ""My husband tells me he never gets head, but I've done it twice in the past month since I haven't been in the mood for sex. He can't remember it and now it's really starting to scare me. I'm trying to keep up with him since he's a HL but obviously not doing a good job if he can't remember it. Help!""  Sorry for hijacking your question, I think you should be trying to ask about the circumstances and see if you can remember any details or determine an alternate thing you might have been doing on that day. If not, start writing your intimacy down on a calendar, but be ready for a fight if you ever show it to her because it's going to feel to her like you're keeping score.  For all of my defense of LLs in this post, it is very possible that your wife is lying you. But if she's right and you're wrong, a direct accusation of lying is going to seriously harm your relationship."

I would suggest she is in serious error, or her husband needs treatment for a very severe brain condition.

You're right....fair is fair and I would wager that one of the exercises that most HLs have been relegated to performing over their years is precisely that in an attempt to get things back on track.    But for your hypothetical post, I'd still bet that a fair number of both men and women would call BS for the same reason, from the guys perspective.  ala...""No guy is going to try to fake his way through 'not remembering' receiving oral sex.  What are you trying to pull?""  An average HL man or woman naturally puts more effort into remembering both recent, and not so recent encounters particularly when they're in a DB."

I doubt you are going to have luck getting her to try anything new."
DeadBedrooms,3dj4hq,doglover1962,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:08:21 2015 UTC,"it would be like having sex with another man   Yeah, except for the whole adjacent vagina, breast, lack of penis thing.  Just because men and women have an orifice or two in common doesn't mean pursuing a ""non-standard"" one is the equivalent of going same-sex."
DeadBedrooms,3dj4hq,Toodark2Read,0,Thu Jul 16 21:36:46 2015 UTC,"She does masturbate... At least if I weren't 100% available whenever she's horny.  No anal is just fine, it was just an example to show she's okay saying NO forcefully when appropriate."
DeadBedrooms,3dj4hq,gregnegative,2,Thu Jul 16 19:19:47 2015 UTC,"If you don't really enjoy sex, having it at all is kind of kinky. :-)  The thing is you already know how she feels about any acts you've suggested, so the best you can hope for is her 'taking one for the team'.  Instead of duty sex, it will be duty kink.  Whether or not that's worth it is up to you."
DeadBedrooms,3dj4hq,ughthatguy,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:27:35 2015 UTC,"She says very consistently she enjoys sex. Just not as frequently as I do.   I don't actually know her opinions. She's had some strong YES and NO reactions, those are easy. But: She says she's good with something but never actually follows through. Is that in or out?  She says she doesn't like oral, but bashfully admits it was nice when we've gotten as far as we've gotten with it. Is that in or out?   (I realize she and I need to talk to figure these things out, you just said ""[I] already know how she feels"" when I don't really)"
DeadBedrooms,3dj4hq,ArthurRobinson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"Some people know what they like and have no interest in exploring.  Not just with sex either.  Food, travelling, books, etc...  The desire to explore must come from within her and anything you propose will likely be met with resistance.  Sharing satisfying experiences with your wife occurs where your interests overlap, not in some fantasy.  Work within her boundaries."
DeadBedrooms,3dj4hq,Toodark2Read,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:29:22 2015 UTC,"But as he's said their interests don't overlap.  Or rather, his interests are an engulfing superset of hers, which begin and end at the quotidian.  OP is looking to discover or expand hers but unfortunately, unless she is a rare unicorn, it just won't happen.  When she:   swears she's not vanilla   She is either lying or she is lying qua OP (perhaps even to herself; I'm attributing no malice).  Edit: Fixed word flow around the quote."
DeadBedrooms,3dj4hq,grinningbeer,-3,Thu Jul 16 19:04:31 2015 UTC,"Work within her boundaries.   I think the thing is with these situations that it's often hard to pinpoint the line between genuinely not interested and nervous and inhibited.  No means no, but...   good but being very uncomfortable to try it again   ...has a lot of wiggle room.  Non-sexual example:  Always wanted to try Thai food...saw a new restaurant pop up and suggested it.  -Nah  Repeatedly suggested it over the next several months. -I really don't think I'll like it.  Co-worker invites her to try it and she sheepishly agrees and enjoys it. -Me....[facepalm]  Cut to a number of years later. -""Maaan....we have got to try that Thai place that just opened up the street."""
DeadBedrooms,3dj4hq,Toodark2Read,5,Thu Jul 16 19:10:37 2015 UTC,"A former boyfriend handed me a paperback full of erotic stories and told me to open it to a random story and we'll copy it. I opened it to a story about anal and read it aloud after explaining that I'm not into it. He spent the next two years convinced that I secretly yearned for anal and pestered me endlessly to try it because he assumed I picked that story deliberately and was too inhibited to admit it. He didn't even enjoy anal, too concerned about germs, but someone somewhere convinced him that all women are inhibited and too shy to ask for what they really want.   The default should be to take people at their word rather than assume we all default to lying. Freud has been proven to be a quack 1,000 times over. We're not repressed simply because some things don't turn us on. If you don't believe that, you trot right out to the nearest Sears tearoom and ask for a dick in your ass and report back. If you say you don't like it, I get to call you a liar until you change your tune.   K?"
DeadBedrooms,3dj4hq,grinningbeer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:20:37 2015 UTC,"The default should be to take people at their word rather than assume we all default to lying   Of course...that's why I began the last bit with ""no means no"".  Your ex was a jerk and Green Eggs and Ham could have gone either way.  I envision a SNL skit where Sam gets the crap kicked out of him shortly after the man in the story (in true SNL style) projectile vomits partially digested, St. Patrick's day green breakfast foods.  But I digress.  It doesn't have to be quite as binary as that.  Plenty of people find that there is something they do with their spouse (both in and out of the bedroom) that isn't particularly enjoyable, but they do it purely because their SO loves it.  I had a girlfriend once who square danced.  I didn't get it, but it was a family thing for her and a great memory so that made it important to me.  My father despises any sort of seafood...can't stand the smell but he'll take my Mom to a nice fish place on special occasions because it makes her feel good and he can always have a good ole' steak.    More directly on topic it's quite alien to me, but plenty of guys don't enjoy going down for some reason or other, but they do enjoy the reaction it gets and that's enough motivation to put their inhibitions or misgivings aside.  It's more of a sliding scale and I'm sure there are plenty of yearning women out there whose SO has put their foot down on giving her oral.  And those women are right to respect his boundary.  The complexities of a deadbedroom cause the HL member to question essentially everything at one point or another and ""Is he/she just shy about ""X"" is one part of the equation.  Again...your boyfriend was a jerk...deluded honestly and it wasn't right for him to put that pressure on you.   Freud has been proven to be a quack   Not about everything...but he also said sometimes a cigar is just a cigar."
DeadBedrooms,3dj4hq,mickjaggled,3,Thu Jul 16 19:47:08 2015 UTC,"He wasn't all that bad, really, but someone somewhere convinced him that all women are too inhibited to know what they like or too inhibited to use direct speech. So he brought up anal just a little too often. I don't know if he ever tried a dick in his ass or not, but I highly recommend it to anyone convinced that every woman secretly wants it.   I just want to go on record that I read ""women don't know what they want"" here too often, and that's the wrong approach if you want an honest dialogue about sex.    but they do enjoy the reaction it gets   Now you are on to something. Anyone can push the right buttons with a familiar partner. But if that familiar partner isn't actually excited about the encounter, it's going to be bland and not worth pursuing."
DeadBedrooms,3dj4hq,OneRedSent,0,Thu Jul 16 20:03:50 2015 UTC,"This is exactly my concern.   When I met her she was adamant that she did not want to use a vibrator. After a bunch of work on my part to convince her to try one, she bought one and once it came she enjoyed it repeatedly."
DeadBedrooms,3dj4hq,LostinAlaska,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:44:17 2015 UTC,"Good luck my friend, you may be in for a tough battle.  My wife would never open up about sexual fantasies, or even tell me what aspects of sex she even enjoyed most.  Ultimately, my wife had emotional baggage that stopped her from truly enjoying sex.  To get to the point where she was willing to tackle her demons, I had to threaten divorce. (That not what I am advocating here).  After counseling and a Rx of antidepressants, we have sex as often as our kids will let us, and we discuss our sexual fantasies all the time.   In fact, its the absolutely the best form of foreplay."
DeadBedrooms,3dgj1a,jakabab,6,Thu Jul 16 02:24:53 2015 UTC,Could be depression. If he is coming off a lot of drugs/going through the steps there's some chemical things happening to his and your body.

DeadBedrooms,3dgj1a,yournotright,9,Thu Jul 16 06:30:28 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm giving you bad news to suggest he just isn't into you anymore. Rug burn on a penis isn't enough to stop most men from fucking a women whom he really wants to fuck.

The things that have preempted any sort of canoodling as of late: the lawn needed mowing, this ""just has to be fixed"" for work and ""we haven't been together in awhile, I just need to get back into it.""
