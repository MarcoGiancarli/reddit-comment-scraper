Here's my list:   Do you have any wildlife where you live? I sometimes put my camera by the birdfeeder or just on the ground waiting for a critter (we have many) to come by. Just set it to loop and keep an occasional eye out. Timelapses are a ton of fun and quite easy to do. Also star trails (if you have moderate or low light pollution.) Get the family involved in creating long exposures at night with any light source. Super slo-mo experiments.
gopro,3dypyj,popsiwinkle,2,Mon Jul 20 21:12:59 2015 UTC,"I think that doing sports or other super cool things is not necessary. You can use your GoPro every time and everywhere you want, I use it during my vacations with my girlfriend, when I ride my bike (unique sport action), when I cook but also when I cut che grass (example here http://youtu.be/l13k7MBVxkU ). I like to use my GoPro and even if yours is a H3 silver you can enjoy it. Can I suggest to use avery mount you have (roll bar, head-strap, chesty etc.) to improve your video? Different POV will change your video positively. If you have few mount, simply buy them or built them; there are many not genuine mount on the web.  I hope that my comment can be useful."

gopro,3dypyj,Stammer20,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:36:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is. The head-mount is very helpful when you had to do use both hands.

Example, my brother and I played wiffelball in my backyard last weekend for like an hour. I took mine out and shot random things: slowmo, timelapse, nice scenery.

gopro,3e13eb,Foreveralone42875,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:57:59 2015 UTC,which one would you recommend instead of the Hero?
gopro,3e13eb,Phillipc96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:16:30 2015 UTC,For starting out I would say get the Hero 4 Silver. It shoots all the way up to 2.7 k and has an LCD screen built it which is actually really nice to have.  If you can afford it. It goes for $399
gopro,3e13eb,sidrx,3,Tue Jul 21 20:52:18 2015 UTC,"Ask yourself this question first, what will I be using it for and how much are you prepared to spend?  Will you need an LCD?  What sort of capture/recording quality will you be happy with?  Would you prefer to have an LCD? Hero+ LCD & the Hero 4 Silver is an option.  Would you want to record 4K? If yes, do you have anything that will playback 4K (4K TV or 4K PC Monitor)?  Mounts/poles would vary depending on what you would want to do.  The only thing I could really recommend at the moment is to get the best you can afford."
gopro,3e13eb,wdoler,2,Tue Jul 21 04:04:49 2015 UTC,I don't need a 4K camera and really don't need to spend the money on the Hero 4 Black :P 1080p is totally fine for me.  generally I'd be using it to film footage of ice hockey and cottage activities like ATVs and tubing.

gopro,3e0ndp,Ritzcarltonsteam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:25:32 2015 UTC,You can most likely find a good comfortable wrist strap like the straps you wear when riding a surf board. As far as I know they make these straps with the mount on top so you can wear the Gopro on your wrist facing towards your fingers.
gopro,3e0ndp,Ritzcarltonsteam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:56:34 2015 UTC,Do you think they're stable while in the water?

gopro,3e0ndp,DanishDaddy69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:03 2015 UTC,all the videos I've seen of the wrist mount have the camera looking to the side of you (if your arms are stretched out in front of you). Do you know what the straps are called that allow it to face forward along with your fingers?

However, you can mitigate those issues with a couple of tips: first, I would slowly ramp the music very subtly. Second, I would either take the audio out completely or edit it according to your music score. In my very humble opinion, I'm not sure the music fits the type of video. I would go for something with a little more ""feel good, indie"". Just my edit style I guess. Good video nonetheless. It looks like you guys had a blast."

gopro,3dxzbq,AirGear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:58:07 2015 UTC,"Are you using it for video or photos? For stills it is a pretty poor camera. Any cell phone should be able to take better, less distorted photos.  I am curious to see some of your pictures. You don't know anything about camera beyond megapixel and say you take good pictures. There is always ruin for improvement."
gopro,3dxzbq,Squirrel_Whisperer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:18:11 2015 UTC,"I am using cameras for both photos and videos. What I mean by ""I can take a good picture but I don't understand megapixels"" mean I have an art background so I can take a well composed and balanced photo and adjust the settings on whatever camera I am using to my needs, but when my friends who are photographers talk cameras to me I don't see the difference in a picture takin with camera x and camera y. dslrs are also bulky and expensive for my specific travel plans."
gopro,3dxzbq,Kogster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:21 2015 UTC,You don't have access to pretty much any setting in a gopro they are as point and shoot as it gets.
gopro,3dxzbq,DolceandGaBanterPLC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"That's not totally true, certainly it doesn't have the extensive range of settings you would find on a DSLR but you can adjust WB, ISO and exposure time as examples.  There's certainly scope to improve a photo if you understand the different settings."
gopro,3dxzbq,Kogster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:01 2015 UTC,Yes you can. But that isn't really how people use the gorpros. Then a regular compact camera might be more bang for the buck.
gopro,3dxzbq,Squirrel_Whisperer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:56 2015 UTC,"What are you using the camera for?  If it is just documenting things and artistic merit isn't a factor then don't get a GoPro.  If the filming is in places where you aren't worried about the safety of the camera, don't get a GoPro.  A mirrorless camera is a great option for size and flexibility.  Their sensors aren't as large as as on a DSLR, so they won't be as capable in capturing detail in shadows and highlights but they take better photos than point and shoots with their ability to easily change shutter speeds and aperature.  The megapixel wars are over.  The top end cameras usually have less megapixels than ""prosumer"" versions.  If you have two equal sized sensors and one is 12mp and the other 24mp, the 12 will have better low light capabilities because each pixel is larger and captures more light.  And having all of those pixels is a waste unless you buy high priced lenses that are very sharp.  People hold on to their lenses and replace the bodies.  Basically an expensive camera body offers flexibility and duraility.  Their flagship cameras have more weather proofing and solid builds.  Their shutters are smoother and last longer.  The sensors capture more information and make editing easier since you can recover detail from blown out highlights or underexposed shadows.  Also the number of auto focus points increase as well as the speed of autofocusing.  I took an older Asian couple's photo with their Nikon D3 (super nice) and the feel of everything was top notch.  Shutter sound, dial placements, viewfinder was large and bright, autofocus points covering the entire view.  Kind of like drawing with a mechanical pencil on printer vs proper charcoal and kneeded eraser on charcoal paper."

I also noticed that the batteries don't last as long probably because of the heat. This is also why I stopped using it as a dash cam. I was too worried the heat was going to ruin the camera. I have the H4S. I would rather find a cheaper camera to use specifically for a dash cam than my $350 gopro.

gopro,3dyms7,LiquidPizza,2,Mon Jul 20 16:29:12 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you're going tandem so you won't be able to fix your gopro to the wing.  I would recommend to use a pole(3 way or telescopic) otherwise you might hurt yourself in take off or landing.  The head mount could do the job but the best picture you can hope for is your and the wing in the same frame. So not doable with a head mount.  Also make sure your instructor is ok with you using a gopole.  Source: I'm a licensed paraglider.

Did you manually do that in GoPro studio? Or is there something that makes it a little easier.  I feel like trying to match up the cutting to the EXACT beats of the song would be very challenging.  Let me know!

gopro,3dxpnf,Preidon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:56:39 2015 UTC,Nice video. I have one suggestion...try MS Hyperlapse for the walking timelapse. It'll make it much smoother.
gopro,3dw2r6,zwang96,3,Mon Jul 20 00:37:45 2015 UTC,"A note on your capture settings:  The gopro's sensor is always grabbing 4k and downscales to whatever resolution you have it set at. Just like stills cameras shooting in RAW but spitting out a JPEG. The only way to increase or decrease the field of view is to set it (superwide, wide, medium, narrow) so 2.7k wide captures the same field of view as 1080p wide.   2.7k's (or 4k's) advantage is sharper images (if your viewer's monitor or TV or whatever can display that high a resolution) NOT field of view. Although depending on the render software you can downscale sharper shots into 1080p from 4k and so on.   Also shooting at 24fps counts out any possibility of slow mo (one of the most impressive things the current gopro's sport these days). Even slowing down the footage by 15% can do wonders for smoother, more cinematic shots without the editing softwares stabilisation having to crop the image. That said taking 120fps shots of action or water or anything really to a quarter speed of real life is a spectacle and a half! Do you think all those hot shot Hollywood movie makers shoot in almost the lowest frame rate possible just because the final movie ends up like that?   It should be remembered that you'll set the export settings to 24fps for that filmic effect, so don't miss out on the option for slow mo and so on by setting your capture settings to it.   The only valid argument for a slower framerate would be battery life and record time. Which is easily doubled, tripled, quadrupled etc by grabbing some more batteries and bigger/more memory cards.  I'm by no means a professional but I would checkout some of the info on the gopro website and professional youtubers/filmmakers' blogs and behind the scenes vids and so on, you've got heaps of great  gear, just need to hone your technique!"
gopro,3dw2r6,spudinthebuff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:28:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, I used to film all the time in 60fps but noticed I never needed the slow-mo, that was just me.

gopro,3dw2r6,tektonnic,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:00 2015 UTC,"The native video output by GoPro is mp4 which is slow for rendering on a lot of editing programs. When editing it helps with playback to convert the native mp4 into avi for Windows and ProRes for Mac (GoPro Cineform works for both). Converting the mp4 into a more editing friendly format makes the editing process much smoother. Nevertheless it is not required, I highly recommend doing it.

gopro,3dtgl6,GoLeePro427,6,Sun Jul 19 08:00:58 2015 UTC,Could you give us some more details about how you made it? I'd like to give it a try.
gopro,3dtgl6,TheDonDonner,2,Sun Jul 19 09:44:13 2015 UTC,A lot of bending and snapping of metal so be careful or just use pvc. I took an aluminum yardstick and bent 20in of it into a U shape. I had a n old Game Klip laying around so I broke off a little piece of it and placed it on top and secured it with tightly wound up electric tape. I took a sticky 3m flat gopro mount and placed it towards the front of the bottom plate. Found a bird perch in my garage and decided to use it as a handle so I cut a little length and fastened it under the top plate and wrapped it tight with electric tape. I thought I was done at this point but when I got to the skatepark and had someone shoot a few clips it was obvious the U needed a brace to stop from bouncing around. I broke off a length of the aluminum to fit snug inside the U. Took another section of dowel from the bird perch and mirrored what I did on the underside of the top plate so the new dowel is placed on the top side of the bottom plate leaving enough room behind the gopro so you dont block its movement. Cut two slits into the fastened dowels then wedge the length of aluminum into the slits completing the brace. It was a snug fit but I wrapped the slit ends with electrical tape too just incase. It was really DIY haha

gopro,3dtgl6,nelisan,3,Sun Jul 19 18:03:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a full second delay. I used to just guess where to point the camera and had no idea if the composition was acceptable until I viewed it when i got home. Its so much easier to compose my shots now its ridiculous. Im using it more like a tripod for now than a rig to shoot lines but when we do get lines we dont use the phone as a viewport. I like that foam tube idea for the handle.

If you want another example go into a sunglass store. There will be a wall of ray bans all different sizes and styles and maybe one section of an off or uncommon brand. If you hold both in your hands you can tell the off brand is studier lighter and more durable. Ask the person working at the store and they will probably tell you that they are hand crafted and made in some other country.

gopro,3du20x,MasonForest14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"As of rinsing INSIDE the housing, I wouldn't do that.  First, it shouldn't be salty inside, it's a waterproof housing. Second, it will introduce moisture inside the housing and unless it dries really well and you stuff it with anti-fog inserts, it will make the camera fog next time you use it.  So just don't rinse inside."
gopro,3du05a,joshm12,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:26:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a great trip you have planned!  So for this I would recommend a suction cup mount for kayaking. Head strap mount for hiking. Wrist mount for scuba diving. For the later two, it's very important that you get a tether and learn how to use it. There are a couple of ways to use the tether. Ideally I believe it goes through the metal door hinge, or you can use this method:  http://gopro.com/support/articles/tethering-instructions-for-housings-without-a-slot-on-the-hinge-of-the-backdoor  Hope that points you in the right direction!"

Video and picture quality is fantastic, the camera in its housing looks sturdy and the touchscreen on the back is very practical.  If you care more about features, image quality and the practicality of a touchscreen on the back then go with the Hero4 Silver but if you need the more compact design with a bit worse image quality then get the Session. You can still use the smartphone app or the remote to control it."
gopro,3dtnab,Eddok,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:22:51 2015 UTC,"The Session does not have a replaceable battery. GoPro says the battery life just shy of 2 hours. Since you have 2 Hero 3s you're replacing, I'm going to guess you're serious about filming. Think of how much more difficult that would be if you couldn't swap batteries, and instead had to wait for the camera to recharge. Note that GoPro did not publish an expected battery life with the screen on: http://gopro.com/support/articles/hero4-session-battery-life"

gopro,3dtnab,tangoshukudai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:38:35 2015 UTC,I just got the Session on Saturday and it's my first GoPro.  I was a fan of the Flip Mino HD back in the day and when I saw the Session I knew it was something I'd want.  I want something to boot up and start filming and it does that perfectly in a really small form factor.  I'm more of a casual/novice when it comes to film.  I've taken a few test videos and it seems to perform well.  I'm not sure if I'd be really appreciating the 4k if I got a Silver/Black and I don't want to be swapping out batteries because of filming at that resolution.
gopro,3dtmdt,blobber109,2,Sun Jul 19 09:47:22 2015 UTC,I would say yes but it's going to depend. I have tossed both my blackout case (same as hero 3+) and also my standard hero 3 case in to the air and had it land into the pool with no issue (probably made it above 10m)  that being said I dragged my 3 case on the concrete at about 75 kph around a curve on my motorcycle and it survived fine. My blackout case was dropped on the concrete and popped open. Those are just my experiences.
gopro,3dtmdt,One_Life_Love,2,Sun Jul 19 09:59:24 2015 UTC,"I have multiple gopro cases one of witch has been shot with a paintball gun multiple 68caliber projectile at around 250to280 fps from a few meters away, even shot on the buttons it was fine for a fair few shots but after a year the case is showing small cracks on the hinge all in all there quite tough I think they would be fine, I'd just be scared of loosing dropping it 10m into water"
gopro,3dtmdt,roadkill435,2,Sun Jul 19 11:15:49 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it. Check this link for a video of a GoPro attached to a R/C plane that crashes into the ocean from about 20 meters up. It actually looks like it's accelerating downwards before the impact, so dropping it into the water from 10m should be fine. Just remember, a GoPro does not float by its self! It needs either the floaty backdoor or a floating grip."

The angle was pretty good. The music was appropriate for the video.  A couple points of feedback. First, the video was too long. You should generally aim for about 3 to 4 minutes to keep peoples attention. There were definitely some lulls that could have been edited out to make it shorter. Try going through your footage and looking for clear highlights, those big hills, big water splashes etc.  About the water spots, sometimes you go out and get some footage and it just ends up being rough footage that's not easy to work with. You have to work with what you got and I totally understand that, but try to learn from it every time. Next time you go out, bring a rag stick or something you can use to occasionally wipe the lens after big splashes. Think of it as an excuse to get back out there and enjoy yourself again!  I hope this all helps you out! Enjoy your camera!"

Image Quality: 12MP Wide Protune: ON Spot Meter: OFF Color: Flat ISO: 100 Sharpness: Low White Balance: Auto Exposure Bias: +1.0      Photos were edited using Adobe Photoshop CS6 and Pixlr Desktop App.      I tried to edit the third photo a bit differently. I wanted to bring out the blue color. In doing so it seems like I created a very HDR looking image with deep blue colors.

Although I should warn you to use original accessories in activities with high risk to lose or damage your camera. And always use a tether. It is must! For example this one: http://www.amazon.ca/CamKix-Stainless-Tether-Lanyard-Session/dp/B00LKX3REC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1437291612&sr=8-2&keywords=gopro+steel+tether

gopro,3dskh0,Caveat53,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:43:04 2015 UTC,It should come with a back door that has an opening too. Basically you have one for indoor shots and one for outdoor / water shots. The closed door / outdoor one will have pretty poor audio but the open one shouldn't be too bad.  It's a little nerve wracking switching the doors but you will get used to it pretty fast haha.
gopro,3ds8i5,invertche_guard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:25:59 2015 UTC,"I set video quality to 1080 and that looks fine but photos don't look so great.       Well, did you take the photo after adjusting the settings for the photo? Video and Photos have different settings.      You can touch up photos to make them look amazing, but the quality is limited by your GoPro's camera. It takes pictures in 12MP wide at the max setting (at least on a HERO4 Black). I suggest trying to touch it up at places like PIXLR.      Another thing you could try is to slice a frame out of the video and use that as a photo!"

gopro,3drzpb,Foreveralone42875,4,Sun Jul 19 00:41:09 2015 UTC,I'm sorry to say this but the plastic on the mount pieces is designed to break before the waterproof case does. It keeps the camera safe. Tethering the camera is really necessary!!!  A floating back door would have been a good idea too.   Since you say you aren't buying GoPro any more I will add this in case your camera finds its way back to you.  Put your contact information inside the waterproof case so WHEN it is found you have a better chance of getting it back.  There are stories of cameras being lost in bodies of water for YEARS and found in working condition.
gopro,3drzpb,Foreveralone42875,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:41:17 2015 UTC,maybe offer a metal mounting bracket.
gopro,3drzpb,SkyShadow,2,Sun Jul 19 00:42:07 2015 UTC,"That would leave the waterproof case as the weakest point, if you used a metal bracket in the water and something broke then your camera would be toast."

gopro,3dr1wl,Dilong-paradoxus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"The side-to-side angle of view of a gopro (hero 3+, for example, gopro lists these specs on their site) is about 120 degrees and the up/down is 69.5 in the 16:9 wide modes.   That means for 360 degree video you probably want to tilt your cameras on their sides so they cover the height with the long side of the video, and use six (360/69.5=5.1) or more cameras to cover all directions horizontally with some overlap.   Brandonjla (or maybe rocketjump) on YouTube has a making-of video for their 360 degree video that shows their gopro 360 setup, and it's similar to what I described. I think an improved version of the mount they used is going to be commercially available from gopro soon."
gopro,3dr1wl,Dilong-paradoxus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:44:56 2015 UTC,"It is possible to transmit a live feed from a gopro for first person view (fpv), but there's enough lag that it will be hard to control.

gopro,3dr1wl,Dilong-paradoxus,2,Sat Jul 18 17:59:00 2015 UTC,"but there's enough lag   I havent looked lately, but the oculus also has (had?) an issue with lag.  Also, after watching many gopro videos, screen shake is pretty bad sometimes. It would need to run through some stabilizing filters which adds a bit of lag at that step too.  Im going to look it all up and do the math and see what kind of lag with all this there would be now, and what amount of lag is acceptable."
gopro,3dr1wl,Dilong-paradoxus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:12:22 2015 UTC,"You can get purpose-built fpv goggles that have very low latency (fatshark and hobbyking are brands I remember off the top of my head) and include the necessary antennas as a kit for way cheaper than an oculus. They won't give as pretty a picture as the oculus would, but they're basically the standard for fpv. Electronic stabilization isn't usually necessary, and the lag almost certainly wouldn't be worth the time and expense to eliminate the shaking.  That said, some people have success with using gopros, but they're not really intended for fpv.   You might want to check out /r/fpv or /r/radiocontrol, they'll be able to give better advice."

A firmware downgrade/upgrade may help.   As to hardware, the lens rings pop off if you pull at an angle. I lost one of mine a long time ago. (Good excuse to modify it for new lenses!) The inside is reasonably well protected if you get nonmetallic and non-liquid stuff in it.  As to battery life, 1/2h is unusual. Could be a symptom of an issue encoding video. (Causing/caused by high cpu/dsp usage)  They're great cameras, looks like you got a dud. Try a firmware downgrade, and if that doesn't work, upgrade again and contact GoPro.

What happens is 1080/30 (or 60) footage looks okay-ish, but at 120 FPS the image quality takes a nosedive down, and it honestly looks like it's being recorded at a much lower resolution and then upscaled, because of how pixelated and jaggy everything becomes, even when the camera is stationary.  I can transfer files via wifi, but it is even slower than USB or using a card reader and simply is not an acceptable option. Besides if I'd have to transfer them straight to my computer, it would connect to the GoPro after disconnecting from my router, leaving me without an internet connection while transferring files.  I never pulled the lens cap straight off, I carefully twisted it, yet the ring around the lens came right off, and it seems like it was only glued on.  The problem with my battery life is it's simply way shorter than advertised. I know there's variations in play just like a silicon lottery for computer hardware, but the battery life I'm getting is just absurd. Two examples are where I both had a full charge is I once only got about 10 minutes of 2.7k/60 recording time, and another occasion I was doing a 4K recording it lasted about 15 minutes until it randomly shut off. It's also worth noting that the camera gets really hot, which is understandable given the processing power required to capture and encode this footage, but it was almost painful to touch.   I don't know at this point whether I'd say a dud or a fugazi, but this Hero4 Black I have is near useless for me.  I've contacted their support on several occasions, and I've mentioned I have the latest software and firmware, yet I get told to update it. Pretty clearly they haven't read a word I've said.  Can't say I'm speaking from experience as this is my first GoPro, but I'm majorly disappointed by the build quality and performance. I've probably mentioned it before, but all the mounting accessories aswell. They're all fragile plastic, and several pieces have broken or bent just from regular use (adjusting, rotating, screwing in the pin, etc).  Forgive me for ranting this much, but I'd expect some more from a camera at this price tag (+ the microSD card and accessories). I find the overall image quality in most cases hardly is better than a phone camera.  http://i.imgur.com/tpo314b.png Here's a screencap of a 4K recording. Yes it is indoors, but I'm right next to a huge window with a lot of light coming in, and it's very bright here. And when I look at this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTcNtgA6gHs) I want to puke."
gopro,3dpphf,MadPatter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:58:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's something wrong with the camera. Here's a shot I just took on mine, on a cloudy day in a dark room. H4B v2.00.00, 4k30, no protein or night mode.   I suspect it's a bitrate issue. In 4k30 without protune, if you record 30s of video, what is the file size? This will estimate whether your device is encoding at the correct bitrate. I'll compare the bitrate to mine to see if that's the case.   Does the audio clicking go away when you switch into a lower-bitrate mode? (Eg. 720p30?)   Are you running v2.00.00?  If you remove the battery, hold the shutter and mode buttons, plug the USB cable into a computer, wait 5 seconds, release the buttons, and wait another 10 seconds, does it show as an unrecognized device in Windows? If so, you've either got a hardware issue with your GoPro or with your computer. (Or a serious gp software issue)  Painful to touch doesn't sound good. It should get hot on the front and top. If it feels hot on the back-right-hand-side (where the wind speed text is) it's possible that the heat has damaged your battery. (Which combined with the fact that all that heat was drawn from the battery would explain the 10-min battery life)"
gopro,3dpphf,MadPatter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:58:40 2015 UTC,"At 4K 30 FPS the birate is about 60Mbit/s, and with a 30 sec recording the file is about 217MB for me.  Took a still photo afterwards with my window open, low ISO and long shutter speed, with the camera set stationary on the window with the suction cup. http://i.imgur.com/haKN1Ca.jpg Yet it comes out blurry and noisy. The lens is clean."
gopro,3dpphf,MadPatter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:16:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, and windows doesn't pick up the camera at all when it's connected via USB anymore. It does detect something's plugged in, but it says the device has malfunctioned and yada yada. Tried the trick with holding the buttons, no help. Firmware is v2.00.00 indeed.  The camera pretty much feels hot all around it's flat surfaces. It could explain some of the random shutoffs it's done aswell, which even happened outdoors in like 5-10C air temps."
gopro,3dpphf,hyzerflip3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:19:55 2015 UTC,"If your camera gets really hot than it's likely that your memory card is not fast enough for the camera, this in itself could be the root cause of most of your quality issues. 1080 120 is not up scaled from 480 although the higher frame rate may cause it to look bad to you if you're not recording in the right conditions. Another problem could be your computer not being able to playback the footage at such a high frame rate to you, especially if it's an older computer.   The mounting issue with the popping and rattling is user error, it's easily resolved by mounting your hardware properly, this includes cranking on the tightening screw if it's going to be moving at any kind of speed, as well as using the white rubber plug they provided with the camera. I'm curious what you're using the camera for if you've broken mounts.  As for the support issue, I've used their support system before and not even for a camera, and they were nothing but attentive, I had actually forgotten to email them back and they sent me a reminder that the ticket was still open and we're hoping we could resolve it.  Honestly it sounds like you're leaving something out of the story here, we all know the shortfalls of the camera but if it really is fucking up this badly then there's gotta be some kind of user error, I use my cameras on a weekly basis and I don't run into any of the issues you're going on about so vehemently here.   If worse comes to worst, you got a dud, tell GoPro, if you have your receipt and it's in warranty you're good to go."

External Bluetooth GPS sends more accurate and precise location info to the phone for timing and speed. Bluetooth OBD2 reader is used to send car's data (throttle position, rpm, coolant temperature, intake air temperature, timing advance, boost pressure) to the phone. Then I used ""DashWare"" program on PC to create guages.  There are other phone apps like Harry's LapTimer that can do data/video overlay directly from the phone (as can RaceChrono), but I prefer the look of DashWare even though it takes more effort."

gopro,3dks89,DanishDaddy69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:48:11 2015 UTC,How did you mount it to the ski? I don't think I would trust an adhesive mount..
gopro,3dks89,doberdann1019,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:48:53 2015 UTC,Suction mount with a tether just in case it gave way. Had the floaty backdoor on just in case. This run it stayed on like a champ. One time when someone else attached it came off during a run - but floated to top w/ the floaty door.  Adhesive mount would probably stay on but would still use the floaty door just in case!
gopro,3dks89,MitchISU,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:20 2015 UTC,"I have tried a bunch of times with the adhesive mount on a wakeboard. The adhesive mount itself is not a problem; it stays on wonderfully.

gopro,3dl6my,CapMSFC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:56:38 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine in the short term, but those cracks are going to get worse.  The way the waterproof seal woks is that black piece puts pressure on the glass, which is pressed against a gasket.  As long as it's still applying the pressure to the glass you're ok.  Cracks won't be enough to cause issues, but a full split could reduce the pressure enough to worry.  The replacement kit is easy enough and not that expensive, but in the meantime I wouldn't worry about using the camera."

gopro,3dmsfg,ollie5050,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:20:21 2015 UTC,"First of all, don't buy gopro branded accessories. There is a reason Woodman is worth $2.3 billion... Go on amazon or ebay and get third party stuff. A lot of times you can't tell the difference, in some cases the non-gopro stuff is better!  For the creative stuff, don't try to just film something, think about perspective. Use your mounts/accessories in different ways to capture different views. Even if you think it might not work try it. And experiment before you are doing it for real. The other day I was putting the gopro all over my mountain bike to try and get different angles and see what looked cool. Figure out where to mount it, what mount to use and what settings to use so you don't get stuck with useless footage and don't do anything with it. Try to keep thinking about the final product.

gopro,3dl5ly,GoProThrowO,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:57:33 2015 UTC,"A Hero4 Silver Edition and a GoPro 3-Way would fit most of your basic needs.  The Hero4 Silver is a great high quality camera for a first GoPro, and the 3 way mount works as a hand-held mount, a pole, and it has a little tripod as well so you can set it off to the side while you drop a knee.  You could also try something like the head strap mount or chest mount if you want to capture the proposal from your point of view.  Don't forget, you'll need a good microSD card (I recommend the Lexar 633x and so does gopro), and it might be good to get a spare battery or two (Wasabi brand on Amazon- cheap and good)."

gopro,3dl3o5,Resvolution,2,Fri Jul 17 05:32:24 2015 UTC,what is spot metering?
gopro,3dl3o5,--007,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:47:25 2015 UTC,"When the camera meters (figures out how to expose the image/video) it will evaluate what it can see based one of two factors.  The first would be center weighted average, which means that it will look at the whole image and average out the best lighting for the whole thing, with a little more attention to the center of the image.  This is the default and is the ideal setting to use for the majority of your GoPro use.  Spot metering uses a different method by which it looks at the very center of the image and adjusts the exposure based on only the center area.  This can help when then interior of the car or house is dark and the outside is bright.  If you use center weighted average, the interior might be fine, but you won't be able to see anything outside because it will be overexposed and almost white.  Using spot metering will make the interior darker, but the outside will be nicely exposed, which is usually the desired effect."
gopro,3dl3o5,Resvolution,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:07 2015 UTC,The H3+ Black as a low light setting that will drop the fps to 24-25 (depending on the resulution). Lower fps means lower ISO and thus less noise.

You can also just plug the GoPro into the USB port and it acts as a card reader. Also, there is a setting in GoPro studio to not have it auto-import so that you can copy the files yourself."
gopro,3dky8s,toozler,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:38:11 2015 UTC,Reading directly from the SD card is faster than via USB cord.

gopro,3dj4sv,GoldLeader66,2,Thu Jul 16 18:10:59 2015 UTC,I'd like to jump in on the question. Is there a huge difference between using a red filter or studio for underwater filming/pictures?
gopro,3dj4sv,dson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:56:38 2015 UTC,"Use the red filter, you'll be glad you did."
gopro,3dj4sv,The_JMO,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:43:58 2015 UTC,Thanks. Mind explaining me why :)?
gopro,3dj4sv,dson,2,Fri Jul 17 05:55:23 2015 UTC,"It will block the excess green/blue and reintroduce the reds. The camera itself can't do it. You can improve unfiltered footage but it will not match the amount of color you get with a filter. Here is a video I made in Indonesia last year, no color correction needed in editing.  Avoid chinese filters, avoid polarpro too. Those were made by people that never dove."
gopro,3dj4sv,toozler,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:31:55 2015 UTC,Ok thank you very much for the input and tipps! Is there a big difference between software edited color correction and filter? If you know by chance :)?
gopro,3dj4sv,dson,2,Fri Jul 17 15:49:06 2015 UTC,"You can improve the color on software, but just a little bit. Once you're past ~10 meters, there's very little that can be done on a computer if no color information was captured for those specific colors you are trying to enhance. If you try to push it too hard via processing, everything starts looking very saturated and weird.  A [good] filter gives better results then correcting on the computer. A little nudge on contrast, on both cases, does help making things sharper in case the water is murky."
gopro,3dj4sv,toozler,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:48:49 2015 UTC,Thank you for the explanation!
gopro,3dj4sv,dson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:57:11 2015 UTC,What was your depth in the video? Those colors are amazing!
gopro,3dj4sv,x98mustangx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:52:19 2015 UTC,Mostly around 15 meters (~50 ft) but 20 meters max (~60ft).   The crazy reef colors and the visibility in Komodo do help a lot! The place is unbelievable.
gopro,3dj4sv,toozler,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:54:51 2015 UTC,What would be a good red filter to use then?
gopro,3dj4sv,Wintergreene,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:25:15 2015 UTC,"I can recommend which to avoid: the chinese filters and the Polar Pro stuff, both are made by people with zero experience in diving and underwater videography and do not color correct at all, just pump in a lot of red and make everything look weirdly brown.  Now, for the good ones, it depends on how much you are willing to spend. There are the SRP external filters that cost around ~$75 and a attach to the outside of the housing. The advantages is that you can remove at the surface/shallow water. There are also the EelVision filters (the one I'm using on the video) that cost around $10 and go inside the housing. The advantage is that it lets more light in (because it's thinner), won't fall during the dive and air bubbles can't cling to it, since it's inside the housing."

gopro,3di5gh,threequartersearth,2,Thu Jul 16 13:43:42 2015 UTC,"I presume this is time lapse video mode?  It's my understanding that in that mode the camera does the processing of the photos, so it would make sense that it reaches a max photo number/filesize if it is going to have to do the processing itself.  Can you just try using normal time lapse photo mode and process the timelapse yourself on a computer?"

gopro,3dg1x4,ap73,4,Thu Jul 16 02:04:57 2015 UTC,"I thinking chesty or 3way tied to your wrist, no way I'd trust the head strap from that height."
gopro,3dg1x4,estlinhaiss,4,Thu Jul 16 00:16:45 2015 UTC,"I just did a pretty high (50ft) bridge jump last week with my GoPro and got this shot!  (It's actually a frame from a 2.7k video).  I'll share my advice.  I would strongly suggest the chesty harness, with the camera angled down toward your feet.  Tighten the mount as much as you can to keep it pointed down, but odds are it'll rotate up against your body when you hit the water from that high.  I regret not wearing mine for my jumps.  What I did is simply hold my GoPole Evo (it floats) to capture myself, the bridge, and the water below.  I let go of the pole before I landed so I could tuck my arm and avoid the smack from the water.  It beat me to the surface all three times I jumped.  I shot in 2.7k 30fps (Hero 3 Black), but you would probably want to go for 1440 or 4k if you've got it in the chesty (also depending on which model you have).  WATCH OUT: The frame I shared is from my third jump.  The first two times, the GoPro had stopped recording when I retrieved it and was showing the file repair icon screen...  The shock of hitting the water from that high interrupted the recording.  I had no idea at the time (and had never seen that icon before), but when I watched later, the videos from the first two jumps were there, but they both ended while I was still standing on the bridge.  That's how much video was lost when the recording was corrupted.  I got lucky with the third video, I suppose.  Letting the camera hit the water on its own probably contributed to the shock issue.  I would bet that holding the pole close on splashdown or wearing the chesty would keep your shot safe, as the GoPro would be entering the water after your lower body has already broken the surface.  Sorry that was long-winded; I wanted share some relevant experience.  Have fun at the swimming hole!"

You need to be VERY close to capure anything remotely interesting.   While it might be a nice musical souvenier for you, it loses my attention really fast.   I too brought my GoPro to a festival this last week (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMZRmIO2Q2o), and used it to work for a little tv/video company. I saw pretty quick that interesting GoPro footage needs to be about the people, not about the music. It needs to be very much in your face for it to be interesting.   Remember the old rule about seeing the white in their eyes. That goes for GoPro too.   That being said, you have some great scenery shots, and I love the photos at the end.   I did read the sign. I didn't realize I wasn't allowed to read it until it was too late. What do I do? :D  EDIT: Added link"

gopro,3dcwk2,bruce3584,2,Wed Jul 15 07:46:55 2015 UTC,it's decent for a gopro but I thought this was with a DSLR so my opinion is already skewed. My only thing is next use a shorter exposure or go somewhere with not that much light pollution.
gopro,3dcwk2,landsharkxx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:17:27 2015 UTC,What made you think that? And ill give shorter exposure a shot. Im not sure why near the end of the timelapse all of my pictures get really bright?
gopro,3dcwk2,landsharkxx,2,Wed Jul 15 17:44:50 2015 UTC,Were you shooting in the very early morning? Or was the a full moon out? Those are things that could make the timelapse/long exposure bright. Also I don't really like the color grading of the first and last clip.
gopro,3dcwk2,landsharkxx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:52:32 2015 UTC,No the moon had already set and it was the middle of the night. What do you mean about the color grading? Is that the kind of orange tint they have?
gopro,3dcwk2,landsharkxx,2,Wed Jul 15 17:55:45 2015 UTC,The fact that everything has a STRONG blue-purple tint to it. I'm guessing that you didn't do any color grading maybe some color correcting but it just looks like the saturation is turned ALL the way up with a blue tint.
gopro,3dcwk2,landsharkxx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, youre right. I was just doing anything i could to make the stars stand out as much as possible. Thanks for the advice :) i guess in the future,  less light pollution, lower exposure, and less color adjustments?"

gopro,3dajh0,avidskier,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:26:04 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll definitely try the time-laps setting next time I'm on a flight.
gopro,3dajh0,js247,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:02:59 2015 UTC,Too many establishing shots of the travel/flight.. cut that to 3 seconds and then get right into the action you had at 1:00-1:16 that was the best part with the actual activities. Would have more of that and less of everything else.  Would put in less selfie-stick coverage also. A few seconds would have accomplished the same thing probably.
gopro,3dajh0,js247,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:16:30 2015 UTC,I agree. The reason I didn't include more activities is because I got the camera as a gift halfway through the trip and didn't have any equipment to shoot my videos properly. The selfiestick I used in this video could barely gold the camera stable.

This would be perfect for GH3 with easy monitor/audio monitoring."
gopro,3d9e9m,witoldc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:16:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as someone who is in the market for a gimbal and does not have one yet, this one really interested me, considering I was trying to decide between the Pround and Feiyu G4 before I saw this. The Z1-Evolution might be the way to go. But since you have a Pround, is it everything you hoped it would be? Easy to use and stays calibrated? Does it have an upside down mode like the Feiyu model? (for perfect low shots)"
gopro,3d9e9m,witoldc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:45:22 2015 UTC,"No gimbal will stay calibrated... at least not anything realistically priced.  Things will throw it off occasionally, like leaving in hot trunk and other things that can screw up IMU, and they all require occasional calibration.  You might go for months without having to recalibrate, or you might go a week.  Overall, I'm happy with it.  Judging by the 2 I have, I would expect this new offering to be high quality.  Zhiyun seems to be doing a good job..."

If it takes special tooling you may never use again for instance. Or the amount of labor you would have to put in is high. I always have my eyes open for DIY projects. I save photos of things I'd like to make.   Doesn't matter that you can ""afford a gopro, but not the handle"". I could have bought a handle but like you I chose to make one from an idea I saw online. I already owned a tripod mount, a long bolt and a paint roller. Cut handle off paint roller, insert bolt, cut bolt to length and boom. Handle. Cheap & effective.   I'm just trying to say that wasting money is wasting money, no matter how much you have in the bank.   Kudos to you. No shame in being thrifty."

Paintballs don't do nearly the damage you think they would to hard things... I'd say this looks more like a defective/poor design of the Session than OP being stupid.

gopro,3d53jo,dodadoo,42,Mon Jul 13 16:35:27 2015 UTC,It is - you just found one of the downsides of unibody construction :-)
gopro,3d53jo,dodadoo,8,Mon Jul 13 16:38:04 2015 UTC,Why are the screws there then? Did the outer case flex but not break and crack the inner camera lens?
gopro,3d53jo,CapMSFC,4,Mon Jul 13 16:45:21 2015 UTC,That's my best bet. There's not even any scratch on the outer case.
gopro,3d53jo,dodadoo,8,Mon Jul 13 16:50:16 2015 UTC,That is a little concerning if they didn't allow for case flex between the lens and the outer glass when it isn't replaceable. I bet the inside camera isn't mounted securely and allows motion forward if you hit it hard enough which a paintball obviously would do.
gopro,3d53jo,CapMSFC,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:57:00 2015 UTC,So you really can't swap out that front glass?  I find that hard to believe.

If the actual lens is broken you can replace that too on all the other models if you really want.

gopro,3d53jo,caosborne,5,Mon Jul 13 22:04:59 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but GoPro has failed once again yet everyone flocks to them like this is a new innovative product. While yes the size is cool and very appeasing in terms of action sports but they are just throwing out shitty products now because they know people will buy them. I've been a huge GoPro fan since they've started and have bought at least 1 camera from each of their models till the 4.   My personal opinion is as soon as they went public the quality dropped. Not only did it drop it really upsets me they stopped doing firmware updates on older models forcing you to either use an old firmware or buy a newer camera. Now that the Sessions price is set I doubt they'll drop it especially if people keep buying them.   While it's hard to move away from GoPro as an action camera I'm finding it more and more entertaining as they introduce models like this.
gopro,3d53jo,ConvertsToMetric,2,Mon Jul 13 22:20:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed seems like they are just milking the rising popularity of the brand, kind of like apple releasing a bunch of slighty different  highly priced products.

gopro,3d53jo,MikeOxmaul,8,Mon Jul 13 22:10:47 2015 UTC,"What could they say that wouldn't completely blow up in their faces? If they replace it, they'll catch hell from other people who only received x% off or had to pay full price again. On the other hand,  If they say ""well sorry that sucks"" , they'd just be restating the obvious and it would just be better that nothing is said at all.  It'd be one of those things where if they were at an event or something and you pulled a rep aside and gave them a rundown and they kicked a free cam your way - there's no record of it to prove that's what happened. On their end, cost wise, you paid for way more than just one camera costs to manufacture but making someone happy, they get the added bonus of having you tell someone of the positive experience (and they end up purchasing a camera) or you yourself would purchase another camera because they did you right.   It's all about keeping a positive spin on the PR. If it turns out there's a design defect and it's on a large scale, you better believe they'd be kicking out free cameras like Oprah but given this is only one person - it's just not a wise thing to do from their perspective.  GoPro is a publicly traded company now and when you have to worry about shareholders and their confidence in your company - whatever charming and friendly quality GoPro used to have went down the drain as soon as they went public. I can't think of any company that stayed as they were before they went public. GoPro had a solid brand and that's what people want when it comes to cashing in - its all about that bottom line."

GoPro does so well because they make a great product that people enjoy using and clearly discussing. Having representatives out in the ""field"" interacting goes a long way even if they're not doing anything special.   The GoPro community is a pretty strong one, so having a public presence has value to them as well, even if it is a simple offer to streamline an annoying process and nothing else."

gopro,3d97h1,toozler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"As suggested, a dive light will help. Place it far away from the camera body to avoid backscatter (i.e. tiny particles floating in the water will look like glitter).   Also, stick with 30fps (or less depending on which 3+ model you have). Lower fps allows the sensor to capture more light. The Black model has an ""auto lowlight"" option that will drop the fps to 24 in 1080p mode.  I'd go as far as dropping the exposure settings in -0.5 so the camera won't bump the ISO very high and introduce too much noise. Personally, I'd prefer the footage a little darker than noisy."

gopro,3d7n63,FatLadInDenial,2,Tue Jul 14 10:10:05 2015 UTC,"It may well provide better quality footage, as 1080p is not the same between cameras. It depends on the sensor. If the sensor was just 1080 pixels tall, the video wouldn't look that good at all from such a small sensor. Hence why they are scaled down, so 1080p out of a basic Hero and 1080p out of a Hero 4 Black will look noticeably different, the H4B has a bigger sensory to capture the image and scale it down, reducing noise and grain."

gopro,3d48zk,jimmy_bones_,2,Tue Jul 14 11:35:21 2015 UTC,For starters you can fix the horizon line and straiten out the video. If your camera is capable try taking a night lapse with 2 second exposure in the same setting. Will make it much more visually interesting.
gopro,3d48zk,DolceandGaBanterPLC,2,Mon Jul 13 13:43:01 2015 UTC,"Out of interest why would he want to use a 2 second exposure?  The shots have plenty of light and he'd just end up with blurry photos.   Personally I think that straightening the video as you said, mounting it outside the car so we don't see the dash and doing some colour work would be fine."

In that case, I'm not sure if you're familiar with Adobe After Effects but you should be able to achieve that with the use of masks, e.g. replace everything except your hand as you snap and then have your hand withdraw from the shot.

gopro,3d3y0d,creeeponthis,2,Mon Jul 13 09:29:04 2015 UTC,I'd go for the Hero 4 Silver.  The LCD is totally worth it and isn't a gimmick at all.  It beats the hell out of having to connect to the camera via wifi any time you want to see what you're filming.  It's great to have any phone's battery is much happier at the end of the day!

If you can afford it I would get one of the main models, black version if you can, without a bundle to bring the cost down and then add to your collection over time, the video quality on the main models are very good and you also have the option of doing all the other stuff if you want to in the future (variety of types of shot make better videos too :) )"

gopro,3d3ehj,3genav,2,Mon Jul 13 05:10:00 2015 UTC,"The actual sensor region used in wide mode is about 4K. The 3+ Silver captures 1080p by skipping lines. Looks like it reads and then skips pairs of lines, even (to make the Bayer filter work). That's never going to look sharp and clean at the same time. More expensive models (AFAIK: 3 Black, 3+ Black, 4 Silver, 4 Black) read the full 4K image and scale down using all samples in most modes. If the 3+ Silver supports narrow mode, try that. It's going to limit your shots, but it should be sharper.  There's also how the 3+ generation was focused a bit closer. Kind of hyperfocal, but somewhat blurry in the distance. On top of that, there seemed to be a problem where some cameras were out of whack with crooked sensor planes. My own 3+ Black is okay in that regard. Most blurriness stems from the resampling kernel (downscaled images are blurrier per pixel than 1:1 images) and bitrate limitations. You can check by using a mode that captures pixels 1:1, like full-res photos or whatever video mode does that on 3+ Silver."
gopro,3d3ehj,footstuff,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:29:40 2015 UTC,Are you using one of gopros recommended SD cards?
gopro,3d3ehj,johnnypoops,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:08:15 2015 UTC,I'm using a Sandisk Ultra 32GB. Didn't know they had a list
gopro,3d3ehj,what_are_you_saying,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:32:09 2015 UTC,Ultra is not quite fast enough for some modes. You need extreme or lexar 600x. A card that can do 45mbps WRITE. They often only put the read speed on the package which is irrelevant and higher then the write.
gopro,3d3ehj,londoncameraman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:01:40 2015 UTC,It look sharp to me. The propeller is blurred in a single frame because it needs to look like a smooth movement when frames are combined together into a video.   I can give you more details if that doesn't make sense?

gopro,3d3ehj,skeetorgandonor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:15:32 2015 UTC,Some from the 3+ generation had issues with the focus. You are also limited by your resolution and usually need to add sharpness in post to get a good image.
