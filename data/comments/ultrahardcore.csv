ultrahardcore,3e45g1,Ratchet6859,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:34:27 2015 UTC,"That could work, but I think the reason they did signups is because people wanted a rough idea of when they would be performing so they didn't have to sit there the whole time waiting, and that gets all messed up when people don't show up.  If you do do signups, you should still let people signup at the event, since posts can get lost in the mythical land of reddit or people might not check the subreddit on the day it's posted and completely miss out."

ultrahardcore,3dzuz9,MegaAltariaMC,8,Tue Jul 21 00:27:11 2015 UTC,It's not considered OP abuse because he opened the chest but because they were helping an individual player within the game.  I understand they were trying to help him fix it but if Robin said he could do it then it would have been less of a hassle. :c
ultrahardcore,3dzuz9,JamEngulfer221,2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:12 2015 UTC,"It actually is and the following points prove that this is a bad host.   As far as I could see in the video, the player has to be within the range of the hole to open the chest so if a player had done it he would have fallen. Hence it is no less than evident that the specs did it. He told specs not to touch the chest, they did, and it interfered his game and got him killed later. They splashed invis on him, which adds on to the offense. They did not listen to his plans after the trap got mistriggered and tried in their own ways to help, which interfered even more"
ultrahardcore,3dzuz9,FDeathCNA,-3,Tue Jul 21 11:16:04 2015 UTC,"That's true, but there's a nice way of doing things, then there's a not-so-nice way.  It was their sixth game. Swearing at them repeatedly in chat isn't going to help anything.  They made a mistake, in one of their first UHCs they've hosted, tried their best to help maybe not even knowing what they were doing was bad, and their reputation is ruined."

ultrahardcore,3dzpfj,ScribLur,22,Mon Jul 20 22:09:42 2015 UTC,"Today marks my 3 year anniversary in this community. It's been a long road since my first game, and even though I have been fairly inactive lately, I still consider myself part of this community after all of the time I have spent here. I have a load of people to thank and I will try to do so in the order that I met them.  Squattamelon - You were my first friend in the community, thank you for inviting me to outcast which gave me the outlet to meet Short and Ab0ve and move me forward into video making and editing.  Shortgamer - You were an amazing friend in the time we spent together, and even though our separation was a bit sour I don't hold anything against you. P.S. you smell bad.  Ab0veAverage - You are one of the nicest people I know, and every talk with you is a pleasure no matter how rare.  Boyce, Dango, neilson, currykitchen, Burtry and everyone else in === Team 4 === for being amazing people to hang out with every night when it was late and everyone else was asleep. The times I spent with you guys were some of the best and you all hold a special place in my heart.  KOKeGoat - For hosting games, that lead to me being added to Ambition and meeting a majority of my best friends today.   KOKeowner - You are a great person, and one of the most down-to-earth people I know. You always know when to be serious and when to crack dumptwuck jokes, and every conversation with you is honestly a privilege.  SolGoat - You are a jerk, but you are a very funny jerk that knows how to be real and see things in a completely different light than most others. You really know how to find mistakes and correct them, even if that is what most others don't want to hear.  Brick and Crimson - For inviting me to Phobia, where I have enjoyed every season I've gotten to play because it truly is a great recorded round with an amazing playerbase.  Epicsackville - You are a loud person with a lot of heart and passion for what you believe in, and I can respect you for who you are, but sometimes not necessarily for how you behave :p.  Vi7155 - You are an arsebag of the highest caliber, but you are without a doubt one of the funniest people I know and its a pleasure to hear you in the channel offending everyone.  miles1baseball - You are a very honest and caring person, with a different sense of humor. Our late nights playing Real Lives 2010 were the best and I think you arrr a really great person.  plant1fish - You are hilarious and your love for offensive jokes and top quality memes always brings a smile to my face.  blindedgamer - You are very kind and soft-spoken, I am glad without a doubt that your mom is getting you ice cream.  Parker, Diana, CopWal, Fraser, Bald, iRe, Lego, and anyone else I met through Luminosity. You are good people and I enjoyed my time in the group.  Da_ChickenMan - You are unarguably one of my best friends currently, and are one of the most real and genuine people I know. You are an amazing person with lot of depth to your personality and you are one of the only people that can force me to get on ts on days when I'm feeling down.   AlexO - You are hilarious m8, you never fail to make me laugh when you are cracking dumb jokes all the time.  Yerru - You are a loud person, but you are a dank meme master and can always bring a smile to my face with your crazy antics.  I would also like to thank anyone I may have forgotten while making this (I'm sure there are a LOT of people). Anyone that has brought a smile to my face has a spot on this list in my mind and I appreciate everything you all have done for me. I would also like to thank everyone else in the community for making this place happen, because without any of you, I wouldn't be here in the first place."

Today I met a kid who has Asperger Syndrome a lot worse than me, he was alone and was moaning a lot. I felt really bad when I saw him. I got him involved with a group of people in Year 7 with him, and I started a conversation with them about Pokemon, and a ton of stuff about it, and although he was still kind of aggressive towards people, he actually seemed calmer and was actually talking to people.  It actually made me feel really proud of myself that I could actually help someone who has something that I have, but a lot more severe. Although it was just a one day thing maybe, helping that kid to actually get into a conversation about something he liked, made my day.  That said I'm not looking forward to the next 2 days since today was so freaking overwhelming for me...  But yeah super proud of myself today, was a really great feeling. :)"

ultrahardcore,3dyamu,ArcherOnSkis,6,Tue Jul 21 03:44:57 2015 UTC,"Opening times for the reason of time slot minipulation. If all games have the same opening time you will never have a problem with something alike to a slave market game opening 45 minutes early, so the timeslot 1 hour back(if they do 15 mins) would have to share players. With this method you won't have the remember the intricacies of each host and can join a game every 15 minutes without fearing a host opening his game the same time as yours."
ultrahardcore,3dyamu,bitlington,4,Mon Jul 20 16:10:34 2015 UTC,"I have recently adopted the opening at start time mechanics.  Some things I have noticed with this is that a host can't say ""we start on time"". This leads people just spamming the host to start the game when you are still preparing to start.   Players won't have to open the match post, meaning they'll read it even less.   Hard truth, but a large number of players do not read the post to  begin with. People just assume a whitelist off time is 10 or 15 mins before for a team game, 5 mins before for a FFA, or 30 mins before for captains. I have had so many people pre game asking, ""Why haven't you opened, its 5 minutes before."" I then need to explain it opens at the start time when it is clearly on the post.  I am all for opening at the time in the title. It keeps multiple games from opening at the same time and keeps fills from being taken by a more popular gamemode. Sure it would take some time to adjust, but so did the implementation of the hosting committee and /r/UHCMatches. People adapt to a new system quickly in most cases."

ultrahardcore,3dyamu,PanicPixel,4,Mon Jul 20 23:49:14 2015 UTC,"I prefer the system with starting at the post time and opening 15 minutes because many more people are used to it, and when hosting, it makes an actual ""deadline"" to start the game. If the whitelist goes off at the title, if it's a newer inexperienced host, they can take as long as they want, possibly making some players restless and leave the game. Also, if the game starts at the title time, you can estimate an approximate time when you will be done, which is good for people with busy schedules. That's just my opinion though."

Before the ""Have to post at least 30 minutes before start"" was implemented, it was actually an hour (for those of you who don't remember).   What's wrong with bringing that back but altering it a little? Maybe have to post an hour before open? Or whatever time you guys choose. 30 minutes before open?  I like the start time in title.

Start time also forces the host to move efficiently, but also not make it so players can be unprepared for the start (e.g. Can go get a drink without the game starting without them)  The argument that it's rarely stuck to is just plain dumb. Hosts should stick to it, because people do the wrong thing doesn't mean that we should change the rule, it means they should change their hosting.  I feel like this list is incredibly biased, missing many of the cons to changing, and blatantly supporting the pro's.  That said, you definitely need to enforce only one time, and imo the start time is the best fit."

ultrahardcore,3dvhjb,MistaUnicorn,6,Mon Jul 20 01:30:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like the way bow pulls back in 1.8, but thats just my opinion :P"
ultrahardcore,3dvhjb,cheesymonkeey78,7,Sun Jul 19 22:03:53 2015 UTC,Tbh I don't notice a difference
ultrahardcore,3dvhjb,CoolestOrange,3,Sun Jul 19 21:46:23 2015 UTC,So I've seen concerns in the past where people noticed that where bows are rendered when pulling back is slightly different in 1.8 than 1.7 (it's lower and too far to the right)   It's really really subtle but it's there (and for some people here it matters a lot in how they aim :p)
ultrahardcore,3dvhjb,upriserryker,7,Sun Jul 19 22:01:24 2015 UTC,maybe if I wasn't retarded I could do this

ultrahardcore,3dy79b,Extreamdeavil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:44:22 2015 UTC,I'll explain step by step   Two players have to be inbetween 20 blocks for this to work. If 10 seconds passes and they dont hit eachother they both get strength 20 for 5 seconds If the strength effect wears off and none of those two players died they both get Wither 5 until they die   Understand it now? ;)
ultrahardcore,3dy79b,Dwarf_Ninnja44,3,Mon Jul 20 14:51:51 2015 UTC,Strength 20 would one shot someone

ultrahardcore,3dvdep,Bubblez97,4,Sun Jul 19 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"Got my report from school today and here's some shit that makes me really angry.  So my grades ranged from D-A in the subjects that i do in school, and my mother started getting angry at me because of the Cs I received (4 or 5) and she was telling me that Cs were bad and stuff.  Like are Cs average? I always thought they were? Apparently I should be working on an A standard and the fact that my mother is saying that I'm not good enough is really upsetting, am I the only one going through this? Or does anybody else's parents get angry over Cs?"
ultrahardcore,3dvdep,MadSainter,4,Sun Jul 19 21:15:59 2015 UTC,"You're not alone.  For the first 10 years of my school life I got pretty much straight As.  in year 10 (11th actual year cos that makes sense) I got a couple of Bs and got progressively worse until my last year. I only managed to salvage my school year through a lot of hard work at the very end of it buuuut throughout the last few years I've always been... at odds with my parents.  I wouldn't worry about it, just know (this ill sound corny and shit) that they're not getting angry at you for self serving reasons. They want you to do well because it will affect the rest of your life.  I really REALLY regret my last two years of school, I put in essentially no effort and fought with my parents regularly. It's no way to live and it has just made doing what I actually want to do now a whole lot harder than it should've been.  tl;dr - just listen to your parents and put in the effort cos in the long run it will really help you."

ultrahardcore,3dvdep,mmmeee04,7,Tue Jul 21 05:11:24 2015 UTC,"Hey guys. When I first joined UHC I never thought I would get so hooked. It turns out that today is my 3 year anniversary of UHC! I remember being a 14 year old boy watching Guude and seeing the first season of UHC and I absolutely loved it. I ended up loving it so much that I actually bought minecraft and when I found out that reddit did uhc's then I jumped on straight away and played it all day. I remember being amazed at people's skills at pvp and I kept watching youtube videos so I could be better. And now here I am, 17 years old still playing UHC. There has been a lot of ups and downs during my time here. I've made friends, fallen out with friends and made up with friends. Its been a great time and I would like to thank all of you for making it so amazing. Now, time to say my thanks to everyone that has made me stick around so long. My memory isn't the greatest so i can't really tell you who i talked to when i was here 3 years ago but i will tell you about everyone i can remember.  I will put everyone i can remember that has given me good experiences even if we have fallen out. I appreciate every single one of you. JonnyJersey, I remember a while back when we used to talk to each other all day, we woke up and jumped straight on ts together and I think i had the most fun playing UHC with this guy. But unfortunately we split our ways and haven't really talked much lately but i still would like to thank him for the amazing memories. Jonny leads me on to the next group of people that made my experience of UHC amazing and that is MrCraftinator, Bjr201111, Praulis, Jaaksminecraft and Milen. I know there is more but for the life of me i cant remember. This group of people were the first group i was part of and had so many amazing memories even though we fell apart because of so many reasons that i wont explain here. I have no idea what im doing or how long this is going to take btw so im sorry guys! Next person i would like to thank who i have just mentioned is Bjr201111. Not long ago, i thought about quitting UHC, i must have been about one day away from quitting UHC and was about to start writing my post to thank everyone. But i saw Bjr in teamspeak, i hadn't talked to him in a while but i knew i could talk to him. He was amazing when i talked to him, and i thank him so much because he got me in Howy's ts. And i think without Bjr doing this then i wouldn't be here typing this to you and still playing UHC.  Next group of people that i would like to thank is every single one of you in Howy's ts. Before i talk about everyone in that ts i would like to thank Howy for running the ts and letting me in. He is absolutely amazing for paying for the ts for us all to use. These last few months from when i joined have been great, they made me feel so welcomed. I will list just a few people that i talk to in there and are making me keep on playing. Its_kane, Bjr, Howy, Hecticity, Boogie, Meghan, Lolzy, Kevin, Hodg5on, Camera, Hammer, Kingsy, Major and radical. Now im sorry if i missed a lot of you but there is a lot of people in there and you know i love you all! I really don't know who else to put because there is so many so i will make a list of everyone that i would like to thank in this list including the people i have spoke to above: Its_kane, Jonny, Bjr, Hodg5on, Craft, Hammer, Fsp, Milen, Praulis, camera, lolzy, howy, Jaak, Meghan, Hect, boogie, kevin, Kingsy, major, radical, Ashleigh, Warlord, Limit, Musa, Seany, JORGE <3, Auri, Jostein, Mentally, Pyro, Isaac, DaPenguin. I am so sorry for anyone that i missed out but this has taken me a while and my brain has gone. Last thing before i end, i would like to thank every single host for doing reddit games for us players to play and for all the admins that do work to make sure we have a fun time. I am sorry if i haven't included you, just reply to here and ill give you a personal thank and maybe a memory i have with you! (This was probably terrible but i did my best!)  Edit: I completely forgot about this but I should really put it in. I joined a random teams game and was put with a player called Fraser. He was from Liverpool and I am from Bradford (West Yorkshire) but one of our teammates said we sounded alike so everyone decided to call me Fraser 2.0. Just thought I would put this is because some people knew me by the name Fraser 2.0 for a very long time. MajorWoof actually thought Fraser was my irl name because he called me it so much!"

Also if you can, check spawners; my friends and I made an orespawn server where most mobs didn't spawn unless there was a spawner nearby. We never figured out the issue, but...  Isn't there something with mobs that can spawn per chunk? See if you accidentally limited how many can spawn in an area?  Near worst case scenario, ask someone if you can use their server(edit the server IP in your post), with worst case being advertise as no mobs/cancelling.  That's pretty much all I got."

ultrahardcore,3du63h,Silver_Moonrox,2,Sun Jul 19 16:22:28 2015 UTC,Optifine version 1.8.7 - VBOs ON - Fast Graphics - 16x16 resource pack   I got a 50 fps increase (30->80) between 1.7 and 1.8 using these settings.
ultrahardcore,3du63h,MasterUrbanda,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:34:56 2015 UTC,"You can't really just ask for advice on which settings to use if we don't have your specs. Different things work for different computers. Some people suggest VBOs, but for me, it'll crash my minecraft completely.  You're gonna want 1.8.7 + the latest Optifine for that version, which can be found here.   Under performance in video settings, you want the ""autosave"" function to be set to 30 minutes. Fast math should be on, smooth fps is up to you; a big problem with fps is having it stutter even if you're getting a high framerate, because the number is fluctuating so quickly. Smooth fps should help with that.  Other than that, start turning things off, animations/details/quality can all be turned off or left on depending on the fps you're getting. Also, personally, I get better fps with 4-6 chunk render distance than 2 due to chunk loading when moving, so try both of those as well."
ultrahardcore,3du63h,MC_Reign,4,Sun Jul 19 17:31:23 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for taking time to do a detailed answer.  Very much appreciated :)
ultrahardcore,3du63h,InfinitiUHC,2,Sun Jul 19 17:59:12 2015 UTC,"I can usually record in 1.8.7 with Optifine at 60+ fps. W/o recording the fps rises to around 120+, but I have a mac, so.....  I turned some animations off in Optifine, turned alternate blocks off, turned VBOs on, and set my render distance to 7-8. That seems to keep my FPS high."
ultrahardcore,3du63h,BlewXwReid,2,Sun Jul 19 18:54:02 2015 UTC,"I usually play with VBOs on and it helps a lot with FPS, of you have VBOs on it unloads any chunks that you are not looking at. So it helps my FPS alot."
ultrahardcore,3du63h,jkderp123,2,Sun Jul 19 21:11:05 2015 UTC,Step one: go on settings and turn render distance to 13  Step two: turn  off computer  Step three: buy better computer  Step four: put everything on minimal settings  Step five: you will now get around 500 FPS for only £1100

ultrahardcore,3dw05r,RobustMech,4,Mon Jul 20 00:14:16 2015 UTC,"Well, first off welcome to the community!    Here is a list of scenarios that you can use to figure out what random words in match posts are. However, most should be in the description of the match post.   As for inside jokes/common phrases, way too many to say.     The major things you should take from the welcome post is be polite in games and on the reddit, if you make a post, make sure it's relevant. For matters of cheating, read the ban guidelines to make sure you're not using any disallowed mods, and don't use hacked clients.  Also general UHC rules apply- don't strip mine, don't try to make regen potions. Be sure to read each match post(if you plan to play a game) since many hosts vary in their rules.    For the most part, you'll see videos of parts of a game someone had(a successful trap, a funny death, etc.) with the occasional group of people uploading a full game similar to Mindcrack(these are Recorded Rounds). Recording isn't required, but you can submit videos if you want to.    Feel free to ask mods of this reddit or r/uhccourtroom about  any concerns, and don't be afraid to take part in discussions or talk to others on the daily community posts."

There is a list of scenarios that people have already given you the link to, so look through that to see what they are, and cutclean and kutklean are more or less the same.    The inside jokes and phrases are difficult to explain, ask around and people will tell you, I haven't been around long enough to know what ""Praise Timon"" means, but a snowballer is someone who gets a lot of kills and golden heads (a golden apple, but replace the apple with a player head from a kill and it heals extra, the amount of health depends on the host) and gets all their lot from that and becomes op.

A lot of people will leave just because they didn't get with someone they wanted, causing you to have to find backups. Now apparently some people think that giving people to whitelist for a backup, means that they get their friend that was willing to be a ""replacement"" and that they can say goodbye to the randy they got. Then there is people who don't come with teamspeak, and you either have to wait for them to download it, or do the whole backup process.  Every random teams game I've hosted,  I've opened 15 minutes before start, and still start late having to deal with the above.

ultrahardcore,3dsrr5,BlazingNeon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:16:39 2015 UTC,"Random team games I almost never host, because it's like a free road to disrespectville.  Ban 1/4 of players for no teamspeak. Ban another 1/4 for disrespect or team killing. Left with half your fill, and it's just far to much hassle.   Host chosen teams, and people join with their teams ready, let others play solo, and everything goes smoothly.  Have you realised that their are not a lot of hosts that host random teams that hosted over 150 games (w/ the exception of /u/_Warlord). They have known from experience, that it's not worth it.  Note: I am not mocking warlord saying that he is inexperienced, Warlord's games are quality and worth playing."

ultrahardcore,3dsrr5,ChipzzyUHC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:53:53 2015 UTC,I would suggest doing sign ups for random games. if only half the people that sign up turn up ban the no shows for the next game and select different people in the future. Hopefully that would discourage people from leaving as they might miss games they wanted to play.

Then, you have to sub anyone who doesnt have ts/a mic, you have to ban people who leave/teamkill and get subs, you have to dq/mute any spammers/cheaters/etc, and if you wanna play the game, thats sorta hard to keep it going smoothly as most of the time of the first ~20 mins will be finding replacements, banning ""REDO"" spammers, etc."

Guess what was not disabled? Right, /near, /home, /sethome, /kit...  EDIT: Oh yeah, DeathBans were also enabled. In spawn. With void holes. I was wondering why people were leaving every time they die.  After finding a way to finally contact them (/essentials:msg Cough) they fix the command issues, but after the game start they are spamming the chat with broadcasts and call us ""ungrateful shits"", constantly muting and unmuting the chat, not understanding that 20+ people at the same time talking is not spamming but just the product of rage building up from having chat muted.  The players had their part, but what did they expect hosting with 70 players on a server that can't hold that amount, plus configuration issues.

ultrahardcore,3drsym,Silver_Moonrox,15,Sat Jul 18 21:08:04 2015 UTC,"I've been saying it for at least a year now, we really shouldn't be allowing just anyone to host here without any idea of who they are, what their server is like, and how well they have it configured (if at all...)"

ultrahardcore,3drsym,silverteeth,9,Sat Jul 18 22:57:29 2015 UTC,"What I think should be done:  All people that are getting into hosting have the option of going through an ""exam"" in order to learn the basics of hosting.  They should be taught how to manage files, have the right configs based on their server, building blocks that make up hosting.  After they are finished with the exam, they will get a little flair assigned to them on /r/uhcmatches that will show that they went through the exam.  If a host has enough penalties against them, then they will lose their flair and have to take the exam again, this time focusing on their wrongs.  That way, this leaves it to the hosts to decide if they actually care about hosting here."
ultrahardcore,3drsym,tempaccount4x,5,Sat Jul 18 21:24:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe a ""verified"" flair? I like the idea.

ultrahardcore,3drsym,silverteeth,2,Sat Jul 18 21:26:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say ""verified"", ""recommended"", or ""approved"" because it would lead to whining, accusations of bias, etc.  Just saying something like ""Passed Exam"" would be fine"

Or would you agree with the flair lowering down Dans to the same ""level"" as a newly host who just passed his exam?  As far as I noticed since I came back, it seems to boil down to a ""double + 10"": A host who has double the amount + 10 games over another can likely provide a better game."
ultrahardcore,3drsym,silverteeth,2,Sat Jul 18 21:34:19 2015 UTC,"I think everyone that frequents this subreddit will agree that dans is one of the best hosts here, as with others.

It is a bad experience more times than it is a good experience.  We got good hosts with time and practice. Many of the newer hosts are much lazier and just do it to feel like they have authority and are better than the rest because they are hosts and have access to their own server.

After their #1 they can ask for help but it is only optional.

For the past 10 games I have played, it has been a new host with a terribly configured server, bukkit:me enabled, spamming broadcasts, and so much more.  Whenever I play these games I end up messaging the host skripts and help, and that takes the fun out of it for me.   I am not saying I aam a perfect host, but I do love my server, and I think it is a good server. The reason is because I spent time, and effort making the server good. That means learning to skript, searching the subreddit for skripts, reading the frickin hosting guide 750 times. New hosts need dedication to make their servers good, and premium. Most of the new servers motd's are just   A minecraft server   Nowadays.

I've thought about hosting a scenario based off of it, called rTo7 Hiker's Special. It would consist of the following:  rTo7 - There were 7 crew members in my crew.  No 0,0 - Hikers can get lost easily.  Large Biomes with lots of Mountains/Amplified - I was in mountainous region for hiking.  Backpacks - It was a backpacking trip. lel  BestPvE - You must survive the harsh terrain.  Endurance - Hikers have no time limit.  So would people like that?

ultrahardcore,3dqexe,Coteup,9,Sat Jul 18 13:09:45 2015 UTC,"This is a big problem for hosts:  I don't care what you say, the majority of UHC players nowadays will prefer to play something easy.  Therefore, a host (usually a new one) will host that scenario because they think better fill = good host.  Now when it comes to ""lost"" scenarios as you have pointed out, some players may feel discouraged to join because they don't know what the game will be like.  I played a golden fleece game a couple of weeks ago and 3/4 of the players died to their greed 30 mins in.  Even with what you leave on the game post, players will most likely not want anything new with some exceptions.  Also, finding the code for these old scenarios can sometimes be a pain.  I wanted to host a self diagnosis game when I hosted and I could not find a skript or plugin at all.  In terms of scenarios like Nightmare Mode, as I said before, people like the game easy nowadays.  Not many people want the game to be as it was years ago, a mix of PvE and PvP.  They want it all to be PvP so they can snowball, get their highlights with x kills, and brag to everyone about it.  You might get some players, but it's usually around 15.  I know it's a matter of preference, but as time has gone on players have wanted the game to be easy for them to play, leading to less demand for these old scenarios.  IIRC most of the old ones did indeed make the game more punishing.  As UHC has grown and reached a wider audience, it has become less and less of what it was before.  On a side note, I think having Vanilla be hosted often is okay."
ultrahardcore,3dqexe,silverteeth,2,Sat Jul 18 14:41:27 2015 UTC,"I agree, although as I've said in the past, nightmare mode isn't really difficult, it's just annoying. A zombie can do 8 hearts to you in one hit. I'm all for making PvE more challenging, but that would be done much better through an AI improvement. Just making them do stupid amounts of damage/spawn other mobs on death is annoying and just makes me want to skip out on PvE all together."
ultrahardcore,3dqexe,Silver_Moonrox,2,Sat Jul 18 15:25:42 2015 UTC,"yeah your comment is precisely why i dont get why everyone's crazy for nightmare mode. it's not a challenge whatsoever, it's a ""block yourself in everytime you see a mob"" aka a time waste"

ultrahardcore,3dqexe,TheRealLampBro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:50:16 2015 UTC,"Simply put, somewhere along the road, standards/ preferences changed, and it's far too late to complain how what is isn't what was. Most active hosts either rarely comment here, or got fed up with pointless whining about gamemodes(""no cutclean,"" ""wtf is dungeoneering, I'm never playing this again(people join without reading the post),"" and the somewhat diminished ""this server is bad, I'm US and have perfect connection(joins an AU/ EU game)"") and stopped hosting those games(if not completely stopping). Somewhere along the road, people thought getting a fill was more important than having an actual game(a 60 man CutClean, tripleore , list of abominations is rarely better than a compensation or PVE based scenario with 10-30 people, yet what do people go for?). Another driving factor is time; people simply don't like waiting for the PVP to start, which is why rush is even a thing, and how many games went from 90-120 to 60-75.     Even looking at the calendar, you have a CC, to4, THS3(this one is rarely seen), a CC FFA, a CC barebones rush aka MU simulator that shouldn't even be there given the TWO CC games before it, a group of scenarios, a CC genie, a CC to4, a to6 superheroes(which many agree shouldn't be a thing), and a 1.8 moles. None of these are appealing to a good amount of us, but so long as there's a fill, why would a host care?"

My strategy in potter used to be to find another mole asap, splash myself with strength, speed and invisibility, go in and exterminate their team. That way I get a teammate straight away and I've already killed off their team.  Works especially well if they picked a kit with gold, in case I take damage.  If I was gonna go the sneaky route though, probably trapper or mobber."

ultrahardcore,3do1jj,Cookiecrumble1,11,Fri Jul 17 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"Played my first reddit game 2 years ago today.  I played a couple of private UHC's with friends before this, primarily elllzman619 and ChunkyBe. They were the guys who introduced me to UHC almost 3 years ago now, when they were playing RR's on the old PlanetMinecraft UHC servers.   They also added me to the AnotherCraft SMP server, where I met a few people from the UHC community, including Schmeon, Czibi, Milen and suma2. I played sporadically for a few months, playing a game or two every month. I also played Calamity with the DerpJMac crew, who have unfortunatly mostly left now :( . Also during this time, I was asked by suma if I wanted to join a group called Newtricy. I accepted. Shortly after that, I left for a while ~6 months.  Then, at about this time last year, I rejoined the community after my exams. I started playing FFA's and rToX games. I managed to pick up the courage to start chatting in the Newtricy skype chat, and even played some games. Little did I know that I was one game away from being kicked out of Newtricy. Considering I met the majority of my friends in Newtricy, that would have changed alot.   I bought a small server to play minigames with the newtricy crew, to replicate what I used to play a year before. I then started hosting, and the rest is history. I hope i've been a positive member of the community!  Anyway, I'd like to thank a few people for making /r/ultrahardcore a really nice place to be.  DrWonkenstein : Helped me get into hosting and one of the first to be friends with me when I came back. Sad you don't play much anymore.   Maj0r_Min3r_98, GlowingNeon, Evilmonkie : Earliest friend group, lads and always willing to carry me in a game.  XFROSTXFIREX, momomimo, awesomemacD, Tvieh, xJamPvP : Another friend group I made early on, we don't play too much together any more, but it was always fun.  Long list of players who deserve a mention : Pepit, adadaddam, alfierobey, BasBs, Naeco, Czibi, FrankieSwift, GoldenOlive, hammer_fan, hannilala, nofear, larsi, schmeon, lolzandpolz, lukegregory, mrcraftinator, python, ruari, swedishmineman, mjdwow, timon, tomochevski, greengecks, cedghoss, gamercool, cybers, joeninety, toot, nightslash, panicpixel,!  Man, that's a long list, hope I didn't miss anyone.   Thanks to everyone in the community for a great time!  Edit: Just realised how long this is :/ RIP"
ultrahardcore,3do1jj,basbs,7,Fri Jul 17 22:21:41 2015 UTC,I think everyone in the eu community will agree with me that you have been one of the most reliable uhc hosts we have known.

Make a skript which allows you to make regions ingame etc, then show me it working on your server, but only then will I believe that skript is better than worldguard."

You Mod couldn't check tps or use /gc to see how badly the server was lagging Your server is really laggy    Players will drop 2 gapples on death.   Only one is dropped."

Water buckets (10% chance of breaking when placing water. Placed water is quickly removed.)  Diamond pickaxe, iron shovel, cobblestone  Trees are randomly generated rather than placed in the same spot. The map will look slightly different every time. The map looks a bit like old alpha terrain because of how they are placed.  Map will reset every 15 minutes. The map reset takes about 1 minute to preform and the server lags a bit during that time. However, the lag goes away shortly after the map resets. Thanks to D4mnX for the plugin that resets the chunks! (I made the tree skript :p)  Removed:  Sounds!   Reduced blocking damage (fall damage is still 50%.)  Bow crit hits  To come:  FFA deathmatch (if enough people want)  Giant two-team duels (again, if people want)  1.7 compatibility    IP: 142.4.212.102:25692"

ultrahardcore,3dibco,MrQamboy,5,Thu Jul 16 15:51:26 2015 UTC,"I like the 1.8 hearts over the percentage stuff because the 100 type of thing always, and still does confuse me. 100% is 10 hearts but 90% is 9.5 hearts, 80% is 8.5 etc.  And 0% is just an enigma on it's own.  The 20-point thing is in between, you forget half the time it counts every half-a-heart but it's definitely less confusing than the 100% system thingy."
ultrahardcore,3dibco,burningtramps,2,Thu Jul 16 15:50:36 2015 UTC,"thats usually caused with something like, someone is on 9.01 hearts, so it rounds it to 90% but it shows you you are on 9.5 hearts because minecraft rounds to up to the nearest 0.5 im pretty sure."

ultrahardcore,3dibco,ChipzzyUHC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:43:53 2015 UTC,"100 because I am used to it, and because tab is fixed in 1.8 so you can always see a players' health.  100 also gives are more accurate representation of a players health.  A tab list using 10 hearts will display a players health as 1 heart, this could mean anything from 6% to 10%, but a tab list out of 100 tell you exactly."

ultrahardcore,3dh0rd,Frostbreath,3,Thu Jul 16 08:03:33 2015 UTC,Is this a sign?  He claims that the 9.1 server is gay and ass. Could this mean minecraft will end at version 9.1 because no one plays it anymore because it's gay and ass or maybe even he simply typed it the wrong way round and 1.9 will be gay ass? We may have found out the near future or maybe even the distant future of minecraft. This man is a time traveller and when he warns us he is banned....

ultrahardcore,3dfeag,Jpgesus,7,Wed Jul 15 21:20:42 2015 UTC,Played my first UHC in a few days. After not getting apples before meetup with 36 gold and 2 gapples I find mrsonicfan and still kill him because of having decent enchants. Jakekub let me get my shit and then kills me because I'm utter shit. UHC isn't as fun anymore. Even when I try to goof around(towering or whatever else) it's just not fun anymore. At this point I'm just too into the community(or a few of the members) as to just leave altogether. Maybe it's just my being bad at the game even though I do try or something and I have no idea where I was going with this post. I suck I guess. Maybe I shouldn't play FFAs since I never do well and playing with people is more fun but I never can get anyone that I like to play with me so that's also nice. Also ever get the feel that everyone else is just putting up with you? Yeah.  Sorry for my misdirectioned rant or whatever.
ultrahardcore,3dfeag,Jakekub,5,Wed Jul 15 21:24:58 2015 UTC,":c  That was my first ffa in ~7 months with a decent amount of kills that i won ( i think i got 5 ), which to some may seem like a long time but others struggle winning one game.

When we were done moving and unpacking stuff we decided to go sit in a field and look at the stars, and for the first time I was able to see the milky way. It was amazing. You never get to see this kind of stuff in the city due to light pollution. I decided to stay the night (her family is like my second family to me) and when we woke up we went horseback riding on her new horses, met all her new cats, and all in all these last 2 days have been amazing."
ultrahardcore,3dfeag,Mr_Norbs,3,Wed Jul 15 21:02:51 2015 UTC,"I put this on the ""what is your uhc story"" thread but I replied late and probably no one read it and I just wanted to share my story again. This is probably boring to people who don't know me and maybe even people who do know me so eh read it or skip it I don't care.  My first game was a rto5 moles game hosted by spork. I was teamed with smellyking, tyler_120 or whatever the guy that was in mindcool's name was, some girl, and TalonIII. Talon helped me install TeamSpeak and was an overall great guy. He became my first friend and we later dicked around on his server with his friend (otter something?) and teamed several times after. I don't know if he realized how bad at the game I was, but we soon stopped teaming and ultimately stopped talking.   I then made friends with camaro, nielson, Einsteinreplica, and some others, but the same soon happened with them. Later, I teamed with Fraser in one of his first games, and we became really good friends. Soon I was in a Skype group with fraser, cybers, mr_toot, frostfire, mentallydisabled, and others. Basically, I was the only American in the group so it made it hard to team with any of them. That group then did a recorded round, which I was invited to but I couldn't record because my computer is poop. That pretty much was the end of my friendship with all of them.   Pretty much every friendship I made started in a random teams game where me and someone else would have good chemistry, then we would do a to2 and they would realize that I suck at pvp and never team with me again. Some people remained friends with me, such as Tvieh and moosh, but most abandoned me. I got sick of this so I left the community quietly by not playing anymore. When I get my laptop for college (which is a gaming laptop from Asus because my school requires like 16 gigs of ram and a good graphics card for engineering students), I will probably start to play again.  Sorry if I forgot to mention anyone by name I still love you"

ultrahardcore,3dg86n,Awesome_Thunder1,3,Thu Jul 16 00:54:28 2015 UTC,"If you were to ignore everything every player in your games said, you'd be an awful host. The fact we have human hosts that help out when their players need help is entirely what separates us from automated UHC servers like hypixel.  This is why automating things with skripts/plugins is a good idea. If you can handle doing everything manually while still answering questions and helping your players have a smooth game, that's great, but for some people that's not feasible. So if you automate things, you'll have less work to do with commands and all of that, and more time to help players."
ultrahardcore,3dg86n,Silver_Moonrox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:59:12 2015 UTC,"off topic, but remember back in the day when people like Fleft who had their UHC match entirely run by a skript and people gave him a bunch of shit for it, saying stuff like the skript posted the matches for him and everything, but times have changed since then"
ultrahardcore,3dg86n,Drake132667596,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:54:21 2015 UTC,"yeah I do, and it's funny how the main people I remember doing that hadn't hosted before/in a long time, before anyone used skript  it was basically ""ew new things! old stuff is always better, nostalgia nostalgia!"" and ""if you have skripts doing everything before you, what happens when skript fails?"" neither of which made much sense at all"
ultrahardcore,3dg86n,Silver_Moonrox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:19:04 2015 UTC,"what happens when skript fails   Which is a valid point. The same also goes for plugins, it's not limited to Skript.

ultrahardcore,3dg86n,tempaccount4x,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:30:13 2015 UTC,"That's more what I meant. A lot of the points people made weren't very valid because it was all hypothetical, not things that are actually issues. Your skripts/plugins could fail, that's obvious and it happens often enough, but if you actually know what you're doing (like fleft does, very obviously :p) then it's not a problem, people just hated on him for any reason they could a lot of the time."
ultrahardcore,3dg86n,Silver_Moonrox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:35:58 2015 UTC,"A good host is someone who is fair and is respectful to the players. Also, being able to handle the pressure of many immature people and to have experience. (To know what you are doing)"
ultrahardcore,3dg86n,smashchicken,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:21:04 2015 UTC,"Learning the commands and perfecting running your game in the technical sense is down to experience and constand improvement the more games you host. The thing that separates good hosts from bad hosts, and they way the hpst deals with human situations, the type of thing automated services like Eximius cannot. You need to maintain order and stick to your rules quite harshly, however show respect to your players if you want them to respect you. I know that the games that went wrong for me early on are the ones where technical things went wrong which led to me losing my rag with the players in game. Players generally know things do go wrong, and if you stay calm with them, they will stay calm with you  Sorry for poor formatting, hope that helps"

Sure, joking around a little bit is fine. No, you don't have to be ""professional"" either as long as you're hosting well and being respectful. But if you're hosting a game for people, you're in a position of authority and responsibility.   If you act like a dickwad like the host in the OP, people will think it's okay to act like a dickwad in other people's games or even their own games if they start hosting."
ultrahardcore,3dbjt6,smashchicken,3,Wed Jul 15 01:30:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly my point! There's a line between a joke and just downright being rude. Hosts especially need to know that line."
ultrahardcore,3dbjt6,Popcane,4,Wed Jul 15 01:36:03 2015 UTC,Solution: Play games from hosts that you know are good.

ultrahardcore,3dbjt6,SpyrojKash,3,Wed Jul 15 01:06:12 2015 UTC,How can a host be this disrespectful? Report him to the hosting commitee immediately.

ultrahardcore,3dbjt6,DankMemeDepot,3,Wed Jul 15 07:14:23 2015 UTC,"I am P1 in this situation. This was a joke, I can confirm. I know the hosts of this game, and all of that was part of inside jokes/banter.  Still, it was pretty stupid and unprofessional of them to do all of that in public chat when I was already in ts with them. Made them look immature and bad overall. How were other people supposed to know they are joking?  I don't think this warrants a hosting ban/UBL for disrespect, they were just joking and I didn't take any of it seriously in the slightest bit.  Once again, there is a standard you're held to as a host, and this is kind of breaking that barrier. But it's not like they were picking on some random host in their game, they were fucking with a friend.  We call each other shit hosts all the time for fun. They learned I was from the south that day and made incest jokes, because that is a southern stereotype.  TL;DR: They really were joking, and although stupid and unprofessional, they shouldn't be punished for it."

ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,12,Tue Jul 14 23:39:14 2015 UTC,"Hello /r/ultrahardcore - it's sluttycow, Head of UHC over at Badlion, but also a long (probably longer than 99% of the people who will read this) vet of ultrahardcore. Probably the most veteran host when it comes to shear time hosting. How old you may ask? Last night at around five am I started doing some digging. I sadly deleted the reddit account /u/sluttycow, which means my original matches can’t be found. However I started hosting around July 10th, 2012. The only proof I found was this video where diamondownage and sepulchr are teaming. As a host I was extremely successful, and probably was the first host to break 100 games (if I include all the impromptus). Even after my ban I was still considered a pretty good host. I loved hosting and before I was UBLD I was the one who started beastboyrolf and Sepulchr’s hosting career. My time on the community has had many ups and downs. I was a member of the UHCS server at it’s prime. This is probably my alltime favorite video from UHCS, and I was also a member of minecore, and the mindcrack reddit server with Ghowden, fairyjuice, etc.   In my 3 years here (I started early May in iTiamos #2, but still can’t find it), I have seen it all. This community just goes on and on about circlejerk and circlejerk, however there are several highlights that came from this. My first time actually getting known was on OG dragonsden. This was before del went and drove it to the ground, but during Jackals reign of success. I was still an annoying ass even back then. Myself, sep, luke (95% sure you cheated too bud) all would x-ray the shit out of that server, and I was probably the only one who was inevitably caught. Fast forward to November 29th and I was caught cheating once again. I still think the alt situation was complete bullshit, and I hope that the mods back then realize how dumb they were to make me banned for 18 months. It’s also ironic since I proposed the idea of having people moderate games (not just host and play) and was a key part of creation of the UBL. Just to continue on this nostalgic trip (I’ve been cruising the reddit for the past couple of hours just finding cool snippets). There is this picture that I found on reddit from November 25th, 2012. There is this picture of someone who I hackusated on the dragonsden server. This was also the dragonsden spawn. Also there was this picture who a really well known /r/mindcrack [sixzolevan or some shit) drew for me of my old skin. Lastly there was this this game which is probably one of my most memorable since I had it recorded, but lost the video somewhere on youtube. Anyways, that was still probably my favorite game of all time. I just want to give a shout out to /user/bergasms /user/No0neAtAll  and /user/sepulchr . As a sidenote to sep – do you remember alc and team black jesus? Now for a bit of introduction on current day me. I currently am a sophomore at the University of Florida. I am head of uhc on badlion, and oversee the games, staff, and future of all things Badlion UHC.  Anyways nostalgia trip aside, there are actual things that I wanted to discuss in this post. I have received permission from the mods to make this, and also did a trial just to see how people would react to such a post, and overall people contributed positively.   So I ask you playerbase of /r/ultrahardcore what improves (don’t be an ass and just shit talk our server) do you want to see on badlion, and do you have any interesting new gamemdoe ideas (not just for uhc)? The current two ideas that I am starting to work into getting them integrated are blooddiamonds and sky high. I am also hosting oldschool games at 4 pm EST (8 pm UTC) that hare headless, absorption less, 64 man, horseless, with a 1k border, and a sudden death."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Drake132667596,10,Tue Jul 14 21:20:33 2015 UTC,"The 10 minute heal shouldn't even be on there anymore. It was only there because back when UHC started out, the game would lag in the beginning because the server wasn't good enough to be stable with that amount of players. Now, with upgraded servers, the 10 minute heal is just there because people like to have a carefree 10 minutes."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,3,Tue Jul 14 21:56:36 2015 UTC,"I've explained this before. People being carefree in 10 minutes isn't a bad thing. I mean look at this from a competitive point of view. It is hard to take damage in the first 10 seconds of the game. We simply reduce the hassle involved and allow the players to accomplish more in less time. They can already be down in a y=11 cave by the 10 minute mark since they could just get their apples and basic supplies, and already head down. For example there is a massive mountain they have to climb down. Rather then taking the extra 3-4 minutes to go down it risk free we allow our players to in a more efficent manner accomplish it. It has become part of our brand and we have zero intention on changing that."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Sarostone98,7,Tue Jul 14 23:29:38 2015 UTC,Why is it better to let people accomplish more on the first day? If anything it needs to be harder to get all the things people like to get on the first day.
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,2,Wed Jul 15 02:14:11 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'll humbly disagree .  Having something be hard isn't really a good thing. Especially when all it does is make things more tedious."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Sarostone98,2,Wed Jul 15 02:36:49 2015 UTC,"While I understand badlion uhc is mainly based on pvp, pve should still have some role in the game, and with how many mobs there are it plays an even smaller role than imo it should. There is no need to make pve an even smaller factor in the game. However I do understand that at this point there would be a lot of hate if you did remove it."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:52:57 2015 UTC,"Coincidentally I found this today   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pxp5NrA-Wg  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7lPcUTGOBo&feature=youtu.be  Mobs do play a role in the game. PvE is not the focus that is being presented on Badlion. When you come on Badlion you can expect the highest tier of elite mineman tryhards in existence, whereas (I also think this is for the better) reddit is the niche for smaller games that have more variety"
ultrahardcore,3datsz,OblivionTU,9,Wed Jul 15 04:58:35 2015 UTC,I think an enchantless game with unbreakable enchant tables scattered around the map at pre determined coords wouls be fun in badlion.
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,5,Tue Jul 14 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"Ohh. I do like that idea. The thing is it seems like it'd be too campy and players would just stay at these and slowly gear up more and more. Once they had enchants they have a major upperhand on someone who doesn't. It also won't take them long to kill enough to get full diamond, so the game will just turn into a bunch of unenchanted iron and diamond players getting wrecked by the same 5~ players depending on where we place the enchants."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,OblivionTU,4,Tue Jul 14 23:27:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe the enchants alternate between the negative negative coordinate counterparts to pos neg to neg pos to pos pos every 10 minutes. That way, you'd have to wait 30 minutes for your coordinates to be even worth camping, while people who are caving can plan to go to the surface when the enchant tables alternate to near their coords."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:34:26 2015 UTC,"Can you think of any other expansions to the idea. I don't mind the gamemode, but having a hypothetical situation is if I leave my cave I don't want to wait 40 minutes to get enchants just because I barely missed it. Also another issue with that is it doesn't really change camping. If anything it'll just turn into a typical border shrink situation and whatever player ends up winning the original fight will now have enchants + the gear of all their foes who they easily beat since they would now have full diamond enchanted.     If this gamemode were to be done the table would have to spawn in random locations, but in a certain algorithm that makes it fair on the greater scale of things. My biggest problem is it that enchants really do give an upper hand in the game. If you fight a bunch of people who don't enchant, you'll end up getting more and more levels and getting to a level where you don't even have to swing your sword because your items became so good.   Hopefully this makes sense."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,OblivionTU,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:45:26 2015 UTC,"It does make sense, yeah, in practice, I can see how snowballing and camping will be even more prevalent.   This one is completely separate, but a game in which enchants are disabled until 1 hour into the game would be really interesting. I'd suggest testing that out to see how the game turns out."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,3,Tue Jul 14 23:49:33 2015 UTC,"Now you're talking.   Okay, how about this. At the 1000x1000 border it waits 15 minutes before another shrink. Then enchantment tables spawn at 500x500 (pos neg, etc) and 0,0. This would lead to some fights, but not make it so that it's camped or anything like that. Also all the players will be in such a close vacinity that they'll be rushed to enchant and could get killed mid process. Kind of like old style mcpvp hunger games and the feast."

ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,4,Tue Jul 14 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"This isn't something that is up to discussion. The way we see it is players now expect it. The 10 minute heal, 10 food, etc. are part of the Badlion UHC brand. If anything the heal actual makes the game more competetivfe since you can be a bit more risky and get down in a cave faster, thus leading to a longer game and more materials to be found."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,friigiid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:26:09 2015 UTC,I'd rather have it be impossible for people to take damage in the first 10 minutes so if anyone falls in lava or runs in a creeper their game isn't ruined.

(EDIT: As a scenario, not a rule, of course :P)  Much more fair fights, and no one gets too overpowered in terms of armor/weaponry. Healing is what would matter most.

Because of this we had to make some work around like changing the schedule to insure that every server had the necessary time to prepare itself.

I'm talking about how caves are just generated on top of each other like crazy to the point where you rarely have to leave y:11. This also results in insanely expansive mine shafts everywhere which I feel should be a bit more rare so you get that excited feeling when you see one.   I'm kind of starting to think I'm going mad, it seems like no one ever mentions the caving at all when talking about badlion. I haven't played a ton, but I'm sure I'm not just getting lucky each time. It gives a much different feel, to me, when it's easy to cave for diamond armor, let alone enchants. But maybe that's just because I've been playing on reddit for a year and a half. I realize it's probably hard to generate the right amount of mobs for so many players too. There may not be a way around that one.   Anyway, I think it'd be super cool if, at least once in a while, there were special games with regular cave generation. But I can understand if the general population wouldn't find much interest in that after the caving they're used to. Just my thoughts. Thanks for reading."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Vawqer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:02:14 2015 UTC,"Mineshaft generation was bugged with 3.0. It has since been fixed and reduced. Sure- it'll make the game less fun for the competitive player, but it brings back to minecraft in its vanilla routes.   Cave generation however has not changed, and I was able to get full damond back then, and am still able too know. Unless I'm going crazy. It is entirely dependent on your skill of caving and your luck."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,4,Tue Jul 14 23:23:14 2015 UTC,"Wait, Badlion cave generation is Vanilla? For some reason I almost never find diamonds in reddit, and I have never gotten full diamond from caving in a non-increased ores reddit game, but I have played only a hand full Badlion games, and gotten a piece diamond armor from caving in each of them. The last one even I got full diamond from caving. Ofc as soon as I crafted it I got mined to by an Xrayer, but for some reason I definitely seem to get more diamonds in Badlion games.  As for my suggestion, if there was a way to watch out for more hackers that would be nice, but without tons of specs that is probably impossible. As well, I always have problems getting into Badlion games. I follow time.is, but from my experience hosts seem to fail to open to time.is, (idk if you guys have a different clock though) causing me to have to spam click the item to get in.  My last complaint/suggestion is that I find it annoying when I fail to get into a game because of the PreWL's donors get. My suggestion is for everyone to get a free monthly PreWL token, that they can use 2 minutes before open, but donors can get in before and get unlimited PreWLs. Therefore those with PreWL tokens still have to compete, but they only get 1 so donors still get quite the edge. So the hierarchy would go Mods>Donors>Those with their monthly PreWL token>Those W/O the PreWL token. As well, maybe you only get a token if you logged x amount of hours into Badlion the month before, as to prevent regular people from using it?

ultrahardcore,3datsz,VishiousRoyalty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:24:21 2015 UTC,No but in uhc there is a distinct way to play risky and cave faster and being able to heal is an essential part of this. I guess it would feel more like mindcrack where you have to be super careful
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:29:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it also discourages fighting. Everyone is just going to do nothing because if they fight they will be cleaned up with no healing."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,2,Tue Jul 14 21:42:48 2015 UTC,Or it leads to a lot more tactical play and being much smarter. The winner of the last game had something like 25 kills. Things start stacking up. It also forces you to use your strengths and brings back a lot of aspects that were important to the growth of badlion. It also puts more emphasis on caving and makes it so that if a player snowballed all game it isn't impossible to kill them.

ultrahardcore,3datsz,bananasash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:37:13 2015 UTC,"I mean with badlions 300+ players skyhigh will lag the server very much. As a host, even with 50ish players, there are a couple lag spikes every minute or so. Imagine that with 300+ :P"
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:44:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm starting to see your point. I think I might scratch that idea for now. Upon reflecting I think it'd be cool if reddit kept these more niche gamemodes that only a setgroup of players enjoy. Badlion will continue to bring in players who are their entirely for the pvp and competitive aspect (which is still fun) whereas reddit can keep these ""uhc is dull what can I do to make it more interesting"" type gamemodes."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Silver_Moonrox,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:37:50 2015 UTC,"Yea i see your point. I can try to scrap up some more ""pvp"" type gamemodes if you would like."

ultrahardcore,3datsz,Drake132667596,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:16:23 2015 UTC,"Similar to Mrcraft's response, although I know you said you're not looking to change that.  In my opinion a much better system would be to just let people with the appropriate ranks in games that have already filled, but have the initial slots open to everyone. This would give people without ranks a fair chance of getting in, while people with ranks are still likely to get in to any game they want. At the moment it's just not fair, most games only have 50-ish slots available before whitelist is off."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,99spikester,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:43:54 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though. We have two hundred players who paid for this prewhitelist, and want to play in that game. The only way we can actively combat this is by letting certain players access to whitelist (but this means you need a friend with lion), and by hosting more and more games. At the moment we are hosting 20~ games a day, and at peek times we are capable of fitting around 800~ players into our uhc. We are doing the best we can. Reddit has issues where not all players can play in all games since they fill up so quickly. We allow a circumvention of that through donations which help keep the server alive."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Drake132667596,2,Tue Jul 14 23:39:59 2015 UTC,We allow a circumvention of that through donations   Isn't that not allowed since the updated EULA?
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:16:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe nerf strength 1 when its enabled?  I like strength being a part of the game and it has that fear factor, but it isn't fun to get 3 or 4 shot when in full diamond.  I like snowballing, but snowballing is way too op with strength the way it is when its enabled."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Piktown,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:49:54 2015 UTC,"I already suggested one thing, but another thing is that you can make ore rates vanilla. I am fairly certain that ore rates are upped, because this is my stats after one game. UHC was meant to be based around not only PVP but also PVE and caving. I know that Badlion is more PVP-based, since it is a PVP server, but UHC should not be people caving for full diamond and 10 gapples in 30 minutes."
ultrahardcore,3datsz,jlaing2011,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:05:49 2015 UTC,That was a bug with uhc 3.0 generation. It should be fixed on all servers starting on 3.1.

ultrahardcore,3datsz,FDeathCNA,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:21:02 2015 UTC,We do have a very good anti-xray plugin where most regular forms of x-ray don't work. However most people are using resource packs (this includes both hypixel and badlion) to cheat. But yeah we do have one.
ultrahardcore,3datsz,Prateon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:14:54 2015 UTC,Huh. This is news to me
ultrahardcore,3datsz,FDeathCNA,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:27:45 2015 UTC,60-100 player games. Maybe if the server can handle it host 3 at once so nearly everybody can still play? Also normal ore mineshaft and overall world generation would fit with the smaller games. Mix in some games like moles since you have smaller games and I think it could be loads of fun.

ultrahardcore,3dexmu,JoshDaNugget,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"The lag thing is not true! 1.8 Was designed for bad computers, in caves i get twice as much fps and i reach about 700fps and on surface in a regular world about 500fps in 1.8, in 1.7 it is about 300fps - 400 fps on surface and same in caves.  The reason peolpe think its bad is because there fps just varies differently, the rendering is different, it doesn't render behind you unless your on surface, in caves it renders behind you in some parts, but in some parts it doesn't render behind you and that's the part you get WAY more fps then usual.  1 Thing I do not like about 1.8 is the fact that pvp just feels rough, not like 1.7. It doesn't feel as smooth, block hitting is a bit weirder and you have to try and do it more normally also hit detection was kinda broken when 1.8 got first launched. I mean i've played tons of uhc's with 1.8 so im used to it completely, and I do not care whether it is 1.8 or 1.7 but if you gave me a choice of 2 different uhc's that have cutclean and 1 is hosted in 1.7, other in 1.8 same host, good host I would most likely choose 1.7 just because I just do better in pvp, might just be a placebo and the rod thing is not true, it just looks weird but in my opinion it looks better. Same with the bow enlargement, looks bigger and better! 1.8 isn't THAT bad."
ultrahardcore,3dexmu,MrQamboy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:42:37 2015 UTC,1.8 was designed for bad computer  1.8 500-800 - 1.7 300-400   Before about 3 weeks ago i played on 30FPS. I tgink you need to think about what is a 'bad PC' coz 300 is most defo not 'bad'
ultrahardcore,3dexmu,JoshDaNugget,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:48:10 2015 UTC,"My computer is gaming, my computer was not an example :P since it isn't bad but i had an old laptop that was ASUS and it had EHH specs and i usually got like 90 fps or so and when in 1.8 that rose to about 200 fps if im lucky but usually 150 fps,  the highest i've seen on my current gaming computer on 1.8 is 800 fps in a sky with no rendering, and 400 on land so."
ultrahardcore,3dexmu,MistaUnicorn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:14:37 2015 UTC,that explains getting average 20-70fps on 1.7 and extreme fps lag spikes on 1.8...
ultrahardcore,3dexmu,BadfanMC,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:26:53 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it really depends on what chunks your loading, heavy chunks will lag you, not as heavy chunks wont. Also if you have a bad computer it can lag on any version depending on what chunk rendering you are on etc."

Unlike Flash, Pietro(Quicksilver) cannot stop going fast, two things happen, he has a healing factor, and he views life with a time delay. Mining Fatigue would go great with him, as he sees life slow.   Hulk can go fast, in full rage mode, he is a Titan running and causing destruction everywhere. Not to mention is impenetrable skin, which would give him resistance, and he would need haste as his strength is easy enough to break stuff quick. To nerf Hulk, just like in the comics, when he takes damage is there a 25% chance he goes rage mode and to nerf him, just as banner had no control, Hulk could get Nasuea.   I could go on and on for each hero, how you could add great nerfs and make it more akin to comicbooks, but I'm too tired."

ultrahardcore,3db2kj,Silver_Moonrox,17,Tue Jul 14 22:09:41 2015 UTC,Don't worry people already do that on twitt. And reddit. And badlion.
ultrahardcore,3db2kj,Crimson5M,4,Tue Jul 14 22:12:45 2015 UTC,When you think about it.  Every single UHC game is about bragging rights.  Who is better? Who got the most kills?  Who clutched the win in the end?  It's all about competition.  Unfortunately just like in regular UHCs players (Communities in this case) tend to have bad sportsmanship and lash out.

ultrahardcore,3db2kj,Crimson5M,-1,Tue Jul 14 22:56:06 2015 UTC,I don't think that was the intention.  I can say that it was a ton of fun and I think most people did have fun.  My team had a lot of fun predicting how to game would go and we had great commentary.  I'm sure most of the other teams felt the same way.  It isn't just about providing entertainment.  It's also just about having fun.

ultrahardcore,3db2kj,Mordon_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:14:56 2015 UTC,"but, why does it matter who is the best at pvp? All the seasons should be to bring the communities together. Like Silver said in the end this will just cause drama"
ultrahardcore,3db2kj,wilsonkong,9,Wed Jul 15 06:12:28 2015 UTC,"When I first heard about the round I was like ""hey look this might be a round to unify our 3 communities"". Instead they turn it into a competition to see which community is the best. Being good in a luck based block game recorded round does not prove that a certain community is better than other rounds. The round should be more about unifying the 3 communities and having fun. However I still think this will be a fun round to watch."
ultrahardcore,3db2kj,silverteeth,-3,Tue Jul 14 23:36:47 2015 UTC,"The point of the first season being a competition was basically to represent where the 3 communities currently are - very seperated, very competitive with each other.

ultrahardcore,3db2kj,EPICSACKVILLE,3,Wed Jul 15 01:34:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe you shouldn't have said it was a competition to see what community is ""better"". Really choosing 12 people from each community who, most of the time, don't play their community's games to battle it out in a luck based, pvp block game is a poor way to decide which community is ""better"" as a hole. I know you had good intentions but when your first sentence of the intro is the oposite of the unifying of our 3 communities, it does against the concept of that recorded round. Maybe if you should have worded it differently, or just explained in the intro. Nothing against you, or the round however. I think unifying our communities is a great idea and I look foreword to it."

ultrahardcore,3d9n17,Jpgesus,6,Thu Jul 16 01:13:43 2015 UTC,"I went to the american school(that I wanna go to till i graduate now) during my ""summer vacation"" of sorts. Well, you had to bring a laptop for some subjects and some people had this curious block game. Minecraft. I kinda pirated it a little till I bought it a bit later and I made a shitty ""castle"" with plain walls that was just a tall rectangle with 2 block high floors. I found mindcrack around episode 2-3 of the zisteau tower incident and watched mindcrack till I came across eximius. There I played a bunch and met this guy named The_Pluper(He's palkia or whatever now I guess) as I found out about the reddit. He was kinda an asshole to his mom and yelled a lot to his family on our calls I just stopped being around him and met Etticey who joined a game thaat no one else joined because it was cancelled and added me on skype after asking if I was a squeaker. I was rather unfamiliar with the term so I said maybe and then we talked a little and yeah. Time went on, I made a crappy subreddit that people denounced was egocentric(well I mean JPGUHC kinda does but still like cmon man) because of the incresing numbers of graser fans I think. Made a lot of shitty scenarios and made a bad name for myself or something. I met smellyking with whom i played quite a bit even though everyoner hated him or something. He told me the berttersprint I was using coud get me UBLd(I honestly had no idea, IT WAS JUST CONVINIENT OKAY? UBL me for this if you want even though this was maybe 1.5 years ago). I made friends with caphynehy and his friends who later kinda ditched me/stopped hanging out with me because of my subreddit thing. A bit after all that happenned, I met Ninjajaja and Sleepingwsirenss, pfamilypfour/rofi on ts(i think there were no passes or custom channels yet but I may be wrong) and asked them to to4. As the time approached my computer had to reset for a windows update and I was so bummed and sad that I basically missed out on having friends to some windows update thing. I did make friends with them though and things happenned, we started hanging out in Ironwolf(so much fun, ty hunterwolf) and made friends with SuddenlyBeagles/Sam who basically ditched us after he became friends with more well known people. Woo. Around this time I met DANINONE in my first ever game that I highlighted after discussing how the game went with him and we quickly became best friends. He was from Brazil and I still miss him. :(. Blah blah blah stuff went on and I played/did well in Connectivity, on of my first RRs. Also skipped meeting tbone who invited me to his first one waaay back but it flopped. It was skyhigh and I think raven/esquimoz/zaenith(?) were the only people I remember were there. Made inb4 and it went badly, tried again and it went badly. Tried again and it went badly, till I made a random comment on the CP to dayna who helped me aorgannize and it went well for once later on, oh man. About maybe 5-6 months from the present a mutual friend introduced me and Thwip and we to2'd on his server's rr in which we got rekt at 00 by a solo and we didn't really talk until later when we became best friends.I also met frigid and more stuff happenned but I already typed like 3200 words so yeah there you go my story on /r/ultrahardcore no ragrets."

ultrahardcore,3d9n17,Crimson5M,3,Tue Jul 14 17:03:26 2015 UTC,I started wanting to play a pvp game that made the game harder after playing minecraft for a bit. I was subscribed to a mr. kurtjmac for a little while and suddenly a mindcrack uhc season 3 comes into my sub box. I began to play around with some friends and eventually wound up playing a couple games here in late 2012. I took a bit of a break and ended up starting back up when a little server called eximius started up. I ended up becoming and losing mod there within a couple months. I then took a much longer break and came back here. And now..... hi am pie.
ultrahardcore,3d9n17,friigiid,3,Tue Jul 14 17:08:10 2015 UTC,"Okay here's the real story.  I was part of a Pokemon forum called The Pokecommunity ages ago (I joined 2009). I was very active there, mostly in the ROM hacking and pixel art sections.  I wanted to watch let's plays of some of the ROM hacks I'd played, so I found MunchingOrange, who I'm still subscribed to but I don't really watch him so much.  Anyway, when Minecraft was in, I think, beta, this guy from my school uploaded a few Minecraft videos. They were kinda shitty.  MunchingOrange then joined a collaboration channel for Nintendo LPs. I can't remember the name but from that I discovered KingDaddyDMAC (who is now on the Hermitcraft server). At the time he only uploaded Pokemon Wi-Fi battles.  So once the Minecraft Adventure update came out, MunchingOrange started a let's play. He mostly used mods and stuff and didn't really upload it too often.  KingDaddyDMAC then started a completely vanilla LP. It was a very technical LP, and he made a huge mob trap which he credited to Etho. So I looked up Etho, and found his single player LP. I watched like, 150 episodes, then realized he had started over, so I skipped to the new world, and continued watching. I also watched a large portion of his Legendary playthrough.  Christmas 2011 came, I got a new laptop that could run Minecraft, but I had no money so I downloaded the cracked version.  Anyway, Etho started Spellbound Caves with Guude and BdoubleO. I subscribed to Bdubs, then found mention of Docm77 on the Minecraft forums and subscribed to him too.  I missed UHC 1&2 because I was subscribed to nobody in Nancy Drew, but when S3 came, the 3 people I was subscribed too, as well as Kurt, were all added. I watched every perspective of each episode and couldn't get enough of it.   I wanted to play some UHC myself, and knew there probably was a place, but I had cracked Minecraft, so instead I hosted a 3 player game on my hamachi server with some friends from The Pokecommunity. I came second, but won the next game.  Then I wanted to play with more people so I had a look on Minecraft forums for cracked UHC servers. And lo and behold, someone was hosting one.  I played for 30 minutes taking no damage and won by default. Then we played Direct Fire, and I met danielsherba. He linked his youtube and I subscribed.  A while later he uploaded the first episode of GGMC UHC S1. I watched as many people as I could, but mainly Blaikie and Gilzor. I found out from the descriptions that they hosted games frequently on the Minecraft forums, but I still didn't have a proper Minecraft account.  At the same time, brianmcn started uploading videos from the UHC subreddit. But again, I knew I couldn't play here either. I was pretty desperate at that point so I did something pretty embarassing: I typed into the youtube search box ""free Minecraft account giveaway"". A youtuber named diehlgames came up, I entered, but thought I had no chance.  I asked one of my Pokecommunity friends (the guy who made the music for my intro) if I could borrow his account for just a day. I was so happy, I signed up for one of iTiamo's games, but I didn't get in. Yeah. Was a little pissed.  The next day, I found out I had won the account giveaway. So, on that day, I joined the GGMC server, and I played my first UHC.  I didn't really play often because my laptop broke and the spare one was crap, nor did I play any team games because i had no mic, but it all changed Christmas when I got a better computer and a shitty headset.  But yeah, I could probably go on, but my fingers hurt from typing on mobile sooooooo...    Edit: Here is the giveaway video, may have actually been a few days before my first game (11th September 2012) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vzg334p9FIg"

ultrahardcore,3d9n17,Lenboy124,2,Tue Jul 14 17:18:34 2015 UTC,"A few years ago, I stumbled upon Pyro's channel and he was uploading Mindcrack UHC Season 7 at the time. (Yes, I came from Mindcrack, start the riots). I honestly had no idea what it was nor did I really care to find out at the time, but I was so hooked I couldn't stop watching. After that season ended, I just kinda forgot about it until I found Etho's channel. He was uploading Season 8 then, and at the time I had no idea about scheduled uploads, so I was constantly refreshing his channel waiting for the next episode. During the long hiatus between Mindcrack S8 and S9, I wanted to start playing myself. I just googled where I could play and found Eximius. I specifically remember my first game I died to suffocation in my first game ever... anyways, I played on there for several months and got quite good (by Eximius standards). Over time, I noticed the frequent players there stopped playing. Wondering where they all went, I discovered the Reddit. Me, being as tech savvy as I am (which is not at all) I couldn't even figure out how to join Reddit games for months... not something I'm proud to admit. It's actually weird what motivated me to figure out how to work them tho - I ran into a someone who used to play on Exmiuis but went to the Reddit (I think it was Wilsonkong?) on Play Mindcrack, and he was there with some other Redditers. They all teamed and since I thought I knew them, I thought I was a part of it too. Yet one of them said ""You're not on the reddit, screw off"" or something, and that got me motivated... somehow... when I eventually joined, I had an old friend from Eximius mythicblade999 (BeyondTheMyths) who invited me to the Ironwolf ts, where I eventually became friends with Guitardoodler, HunterWolf, BushieHalf, BerlinRiver and a few others. We became a group of friends throughout the summer of 2014 (which I can't say how thankful I am cause that was right after the worst time of my life, and they kept me going), I eventually became on Guitar's and Bushie's reddit servers, and I also became a mod on Ironwolf. We stayed friends for a while (but looking back on it, I wasn't really any of their ""friends"" except for Hunter :////) until I went to camp for a few days and by the time I was back, the group had gotten in an arguement and we pretty much broke apart. School had started for me, and I LOOOOOVED my school so it didn't hit me too hard honestly. Somehow, I became friends with GreenDoomsDay somewhere along the way and he introduced me to noir173. Us 3 were pretty good friends and I even meant some people like hunter6333, ProHulk, MoTo and a few others along the way. However, somewhere around February, I left the community as I was really getting interested in my real life and was becoming disinterested with UHC. When summer hits though, all of my real life friends start to ignore me or just stop talking to me for the season. Even my girlfriend who I was really happy with and I thought the feelings were the same with her broke up with me, so not wanting to be antisocial for the rest of the summer until school came again, I came back to UHC. None of my old friends were anywhere to be found so I became pretty discouraged at the start. I joined a Twitter game one day, and there was an old friend I had made 2 years ago on Exmiuis, FDeath. He invited me to a private teamspeak where I met all of my present day friends. Since joining back, I've made more internet friends than I've ever had, I've become a moderator on Twitt, and I've even been invited to a few RR's.

Then after bugging him for a few months with game after game, I met HyperSlayer1514 in a To2 potential hearts.  We did pretty well but lost connections.  I found him on Mineplex and we were best friends after that :D  Then, I met VengefulZed on hypixel UHC.  I buddied him and we played a reddit UHC.  Then I met the smashchockin crew of Lukr59, Gamin, Slib, and Smash.  I became pretty good friends with Smash and Luke.  I play with them and we're a happy family.  Here I am typing this."
ultrahardcore,3d9n17,Ratchet6859,4,Wed Jul 15 02:35:05 2015 UTC,"Okay, here we go.  Part One: Discovery of UHC  A looooooooooooooooooong while back my brother showed me This video.  I didn't think much of it then.  UHC was always in the back of my head, though.  Then, around the time when I was getting bored of Trouble in Mineville, I watched Zisteau's perspective in Mindcrack UHC Season 14.  So the first ever UHC fight I saw was a cave fight >_<.  Anyway, after that I started to binge Burning's Mindcrack UHC montages.  And then, I saw his RnR and AP season 1 montages.  Those were the first ever ""Reddit UHC"" videos I ever watched.  The silly thing is, I didn't know about Reddit UHC so I just thought: ""Oh cool! A group of people organizing a UHC season!  Kind of like the Cube!""  Not proud of thinking that :/.  Also because I was unaware of Reddit UHC I was confused on why AP and RnR had a few of the same people in them.  Part Two: Cube  Ironically, I first heard about Reddit UHC through the Cube.  I decided to watch the Cube UHC season 5 montage because I didn't like the PvP in Mindcrack seasons.  I was basically hooked immediately.  I didn't watch the Cube, or anyone in the Cube, but I started to watch the UHC seasons.  Then, my brother (Again) told me that Graser was playing Reddit UHCs.  I had no idea what those were and I didn't for another while.  Part Three: BrickPlays  One day, waiting for the next Cube season to come out.  I spot a channel called BrickPlays in my recommended channels section on my subscriptions page.  I click the link and I'm taken to a channel with a small 500 subs.  I watch the first few highlights and I'm hooked again.  After watching Brick for a while I decide I want to play a Reddit game.  So I play one, and another, and another, and so on and so on.  This also explains why I used to be a huge Brick fanboy.  Part Four: Frenzy  After playing FFAs for a while I decide to finally ""join the community.""  I start commenting here and there.  I host a game (it went horrible but the community wasn't 70% shit back then so it ended up being pretty fun) and I make a montage of Dibzcraft.  It explodes and stays on the front page for a long time.  I feel amazing at that point.  Then, I get a Reddit message from CoolestOrange.  He asks me if I want to be in this new RR called Frenzy.  I accept and I'm added to the chat.  Season goes pretty well and I make an awesome intro and I go from having no friends or connections to being kind of known within the Frenzy chat.  Part 5: Badlion To4?  At this point, I still haven't teamed with anyone, and I still hadn't really talked to someone in ts.  But in the Frenzy chat, Wilsonkong asks if anyone wants to play a To4 Badlion with him.  I was free so I teamed with him and Dayna (we didn't end up getting a 4th player).  We slay in that game and was pretty fun all together.  Wilson uploaded the game to his channel if anyone's interested.  From then, I just started teaming with people and making friends.  And that's pretty much where I am now.  Whew, that was a wall of text.  Thanks to anyone who read it all! :D"

Found Reddit through his first highlights and I tried to stream my first ever game on the 28th of January, but I failed badly. I played Reddit for a while then got bored of UHC on Reddit, mostly because I was too bad in my mind. But, I stuck around on the Reddit watching highlights and recorded rounds. I played an Eximius because a friend showed me it. I've played that since August last year. Gained first UHC win, kill, double kill a lot of things. I returned to Reddit earlier this year and I got my first Reddit kill and then another 4 kills out of probably the 20 games I've played since returning."

It was Mindcrack's S9, and we watched Nancy Drew's episode 3, where Guude had screamed ""C-C-CREEPER! CMON GUYS LETS GET OUT OF HERE GUYS!"" I like survival type things and we managed to get a group of people playing some games. I later got a personal server and hosted a few for my friends. A bunch either got busy or disinterested during school(most of us hit our junior year in HS) and the rest thought we needed more people (the most we ever had was 7). Anywho my SMP on it(we had regen turned off like Mindcrack's SMP S4), and we stopped UHC. Somewhere in between, I had seen Break's montage of season 5, then I hunted for every season's montage. I saw Burning had made one for 9, and saw his for 10, and subbed to him. I saw his montages for AP and RnR and thought these were cool, so I subbed to some of the guys(I'm pretty sure I saw WMC 8 in Break's uploads, maybe Dibz as well, but never watched it). Anywho I saw AP 2 and then RnR 3, and I eventually checked out Burning's UHC clips. After checking for the other 2 hours of footage in March(I was really busy with school up until this time), I saw the link to reddit. I played a couple of FFA's either in late march or early April(it took me a while to figure out that there was a calendar, but as I said, I didn't have much time to explore everything here until a month later). In late April, I decided to make a reddit account and see how things would go. And here I am today, 1.25ish years later."

I shied away from reddit as I didn't know what it was and thought YouTube was enough.   Then I saw Etho in UHC Season 3, I ended up watching it and wanted to play it myself, so I started using reddit, but I didn't know about /r/ultrahardcore until around Season 7, and whenever I saw it I thought of it as something stupid and went back to watching UHC.   Well, come a long time later (March 5th 2013) I decided to bite the bullet and play UHC. I ended up playing a rto4 with Sepulchr and two others I can't remember, but I ended up winning that game (I was carried in PvP though I did get 1 kill and caving).   After that I didn't play very often or participated in anything related to the community until around late June or early July. When I started using reddit is when everything went downhill for my ""reputation"" as to say. But, I was still able to make some friends including Epicsackville, Blindedgamer, ScOpE_H3ad, SugarPuffzz, and Sepulchr. These guys ended up being people who defined my time here.  Later on in a random teams game, I met Dibz. We became friends then but not very close but we talked every now and then, but right after I met Dibz, I met the DerpJMac group. From there I met Mischevous and we became pretty good friends, and ended up getting added to a group called HypeKewl by Pippiter. I was never really close to Pippiter. Then Ambition came along and I didn't really meet anyone from there that I'm still friends with.   Then we go onto the time after Ambition, where I ended up meeting AfterBurn3r (Zydoxe), Whohaw, CommanderClear, Zanify, and SuddenlyBeagles. We were all pretty close until out little friend group split and ended up hating each other except me, who kinda jumped between each group. I got tired of that so I just decided to stick with CC and Zanify, but shortly after that Zanify left the community, and then CC stopped playing because of College.   I don't necessarily remember anything significant after that other than getting a new computer, joining HIB, and then restriction. I was a last minute sub for HIB7 and ended up bring able to stay, but I was invited to restriction as a memeber by rockonhi5 and from there I met a lot of people from harbored and became a part of it too. I also ended up creating the Mumble group which has been pretty successful and I wouldn't have been able to make it without harbored.  Fuck this was all done on mobile my fingers hurt."

ultrahardcore,3d9n17,buttergolem1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:18:36 2015 UTC,"A long, long time ago, I was browsing through the usual Minecraft stuff, and on my recommended box ""Etho Plays Minecraft"". I start watching, get addicted, and watch loads of it. I see that Etho posted something else other than singleplayer, ""UHC Season 3"". I watch it, and get addicted to UHC. I watched everyones perspectives until season 5, then began the search for UHC. I searched online for ""public UHC"". I promptly find ""Eximius"", on which I play many, many games, xraying in all of them (of course). There is a bit of a backstory to xraying. Around 5 years ago, I played Minecraft with some friends in school. One of my friends got a hacked client when he had his server, and I managed to download one and I told all of my friends how to as well. From this point on, I was xraying. So yeah, never was caught on Eximius (well, at least before I joined reddit UHC). I am playing a game, and I see someone say something in chat:  <coninmm>: anyone want to play nail after this?  I respond: sure! Add me on skype: [insert skype name]. We become great friends, and yeah. I am now playing another eximius game, a teams game, with coninmm Snuggelz007 and thomastinky. I die early on, so I leave the call. Before I left, someone in chat says ""does anyone want to play some REAL uhc?"". I, wondering want this is, say ""sure! what is the ip? and add me on skype!"". It was delqhic's game, a 90-man FFA when the original slot count was 60. It filled like hell, and it was daunting. All of these professional PvPers, and me. A crap player, with xray. This person who introduced me- jameslikesrap. So we start, and I spawn in a jungle. I find a temple, and raid it. Nothing good in it, so I get my tools, and begin xraying. I find a dungeon and dig to the side (""digging to sounds"") and find diamonds. It was an 8 vein, so I make a nether portal (stupid me digging all of the obsidian to get a portal). The portal is trapped, and I die. :(  I carry on speaking to jameslikesrap for the next hour or so, and he adds me to a skype chat. I asked what it was, and it said ""Official Reddit UHC Skype Chat"". There were only around 40 people in it, and people kept putting IPs in chat for around 4/5 months. This is where I was playing my games. My first teams game, I team with Jameslikesrap, Avi_xD and dkemelor. We win, surprisingly. After the 4/5 months of skype UHCs, someone links the subreddit. I can't remember what my original reddit account was, but I originally introduced myself on a game post, on Wednesday 13th February 2013. This is where I played my first game from finding the IP myself. Things happen, I play with xray for around a year. I was never reported for xray, never actually caught. Only once where I was ""caught"", my report for hacked client. I'm pretty sure that I can't be UBL'd for admitting that I hacked in the past, but if I can, then I'll take it right now. I was using a hacked client when I was reported for one. I only stopped using xray and a hacked client around 12 months ago. All I use nowadays is UHC essentials. Anyways, I've typed too much. bye"

I decided to check it out and my first game was Sepple's #4 mystery teams (I didn't have team speak). Luckily I didn't find any team mates. I played a bit until the end of the summer and then I didn't play for a while. I had subscribed to a few youtube channels from here and when I saw Quake's AP Season 1 it made me want to play UHC again. I was a part of Smolocraft (the mumble UHC group) but then I left. Around spring 2014 I played a lot of xhockey & NJ's slave markets and was added to Luminosity where I met most of my current friends.Geo also said I should apply to GGMC and I was accepted. At the beginning of the summer I was added to Cynical. During UHCA I was on the GGMC team but I never played with them and Griffin aka Zenniker asked me to join his team called Illustrious so I did. Then UHCA died. I subbed for Lucrorium Season 1 but that died too. I also played Inseparable: The Sequel. Nothing much has happened since then.

My first game was a rto5 moles game hosted by spork. I was teamed with smellyking, tyler_120 or whatever the guy that was in mindcool's name was, some girl, and TalonIII. Talon helped me install TeamSpeak and was an overall great guy. He became my first friend and we later dicked around on his server with his friend (otter something?) and teamed several times after. I don't know if he realized how bad at the game I was, but we soon stopped teaming and ultimately stopped talking.   I then made friends with camaro, nielson, Einsteinreplica, and some others, but the same soon happened with them. Later, I teamed with Fraser in one of his first games, and we became really good friends. Soon I was in a Skype group with fraser, cybers, mr_toot, frostfire, mentallydisabled, and others. Basically, I was the only American in the group so it made it hard to team with any of them. That group then did a recorded round, which I was invited to but I couldn't record because my computer is poop. That pretty much was the end of my friendship with all of them.   Pretty much every friendship I made started in a random teams game where me and someone else would have good chemistry, then we would do a to2 and they would realize that I suck at pvp and never team with me again. Some people remained friends with me, such as Tvieh and moosh, but most abandoned me. I got sick of this so I left the community quietly by not playing anymore. When I get my laptop for college (which is a gaming laptop from Asus because my school requires like 16 gigs of ram and a good graphics card for engineering students), I will probably start to play again.  Sorry if I forgot to mention anyone by name I still love you"

I watched it, but at the time I wasn't that into minecraft, so I didn't really enjoy it that much.  A few months later in April of 2013, he uploaded WMC season 4, and I enjoyed a lot.  In the description he linked to the subreddit.  Back then there weren't games nearly as often as today, so I didn't get a chance to play my first game until May 17th.

Anyway, Doctor Pong had a dream. His dream was to drop the freshest fucking memes known to mankind.  Alone however he was not enough. He needed a sexy beast of a man who could melt women's clothes with his stare. Enough brute force to cause tremors merely with his flatulence. Intelligence that would parallel his creator.

A couple months later, after being addicted to their UHC videos for that long, I decided to search 'UHC' on YouTube to see if anybody else did UHCs like Mindcrack (yeah I was quite surprised to see much more than just Mindcrackers doing UHC). After watching tons of YouTube videos after months and months of addiction, I stumbled across this guy named xNestorio (he's not very famous so idk if many of you will know him). He linked this subreddit in his description and I checked it out to see if it was cool; it was. I then posted this noobish post where I asked to be in a Recorded Round.

I became addicted to the gamemode, and watched any season I could.  I used to be a part of the SCB Community, and it had a forums page. I asked my followers if any public UHC servers existed, and they said Excimius. I played a couple till I saw BadAnt and dkelmor playing one as well. They started boasting how better Reddit was, and me never having heard of it, I defended Excimius. It was quite childish. My ignorance lasted a couple months till I finally decided to play a Reddit game. That was either March or April 2014, can't remember.

Looked up UHC servers, found the promised land itself, Eximius. Played their about 2-3 weeks, got tired of struggling to get in and paid 10$ for donator so I could always get in. About a week or two later Graser uploaded a video of him playing Reddit uhcs. Thought, why not try this, since I got very tired of being on one server easily.

ultrahardcore,3d67hh,scotlanduhc,24,Tue Jul 14 00:24:19 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone, I need to get this off my chest.  I live in rural Scotland. Sheep fucking is very rampant in these parts as you know, and Wales as well as other united countries began to fuck sheep in Scotland as the assholes are tighter. Little did we know that our so called angels would be our devils. Everyone I know in my country has been affected by the fucking of  sheep in Scotland borders, and the primary perpetrators are tea drinking wankers from England trying to pleasure themselves. Recently, there has even been a case of a small 13 year old boy being killed in a sheep fucking accident due to these hard conditions, who later claimed that the child had any association with being a tea drinking wanker.  Did I mention the series of famines that began to plague my beautiful Christian nation? Interestingly enough, these are also linked to English activity within our borders. Shit football teams and tea drinking follows after everything England does, regardless of they nation they give their so called 'cocks' to. Nothing they do ever gives any benefit to society, they are all bunch of pompous individuals who prey on lesser nations like Scotland and Wales. Out of the ordinary this is, as no other nation even TRIES to stop their sheep fucking tomfoolery.  We, the people of The Peoples Republic of Scotland, despise the actions of the English. Realistically, I'm pretty sure every nation is tired of these twats. Over the past hundred of years they claim to be a great and powerful nation, and while they have done a variety of goods, they have yet to start doing things themselves and quit being lazy bums. Now, I'm sorry that this may not fit here, but as a fellow member of the reddit (I wont give out my name due to the large majority of wankers here), I feel like I have every right to say it.  Glory and peace be with you my friends, in these grand times of despair."

I've been ON the UBL before, and it's not like I hold an upstanding relationship with the community.  Of course, I want to be a good member to it, and plan on being extremely active.

ultrahardcore,3d28ep,ThePurpOfDans,2,Mon Jul 13 01:59:38 2015 UTC,I don't know why people are complaining about the teams so much this is gonna be great
ultrahardcore,3d28ep,Crimson5M,2,Mon Jul 13 03:46:31 2015 UTC,1st team: Definitely reddit  2nd team: 1/2 of the team is Reddit  3rd team: 3/4ths of the team is reddit  I can agree with the rest.
ultrahardcore,3d28ep,MrCraftLP,3,Mon Jul 13 02:07:46 2015 UTC,what sort of drugs are you on
ultrahardcore,3d28ep,Crimson5M,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:39:20 2015 UTC,I want some if they'll help me deal with his ignorance.
ultrahardcore,3d28ep,MrCraftLP,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:17:55 2015 UTC,"Well I mean, in his opinion, some people are on the wrong teams."
ultrahardcore,3d28ep,Crimson5M,2,Mon Jul 13 03:49:33 2015 UTC,"How can they be on the wrong teams?  There are people who play reddit and twitt, reddit and badlion, twitt and badlion.  Either way, isn't the idea to unite people from those three sub-communities?"
ultrahardcore,3d28ep,Crimson5M,0,Mon Jul 13 04:02:33 2015 UTC,"The way they advertised it is that the teams are supposed to be representing which community they are from, but a lot of them can't even be considered apart of the community."
ultrahardcore,3d28ep,Tylarzz,4,Mon Jul 13 05:12:25 2015 UTC,"Then what makes someone ""apart"" of their respective community?"
ultrahardcore,3d28ep,MrCraftLP,2,Mon Jul 13 06:14:07 2015 UTC,Actively playing public games or participating in the actual community.
ultrahardcore,3d28ep,undauntable__,2,Mon Jul 13 07:00:42 2015 UTC,I see those people around all the time and I've played one reddit game in nearly three months.  I seem to recall you doing a lot of complaining when your favourites never got into All Stars either.
ultrahardcore,3d28ep,MrCraftLP,5,Mon Jul 13 07:13:31 2015 UTC,1st team: 4/4 of them play reddit games.  2nd team: 4/4 of them play reddit games.  3dd team: 4/4 of them play reddit games.  All three of them are reddit.
ultrahardcore,3d28ep,dianab0522,3,Mon Jul 13 03:17:24 2015 UTC,i mean i've been here longer than you man

The struggles of fighting against the environment not killing each other, and learning how to adjust to a game that isn’t CS:GO lie ahead for our heroes  0:25 One newcomer, and three others already familiar with the battlefield, their journey to locate and order corn will be treacherous, and long. But with the will of Tony on their side, they may just have what it takes to endure it.  0:30 Plagued by their inability to melee, below average bow skills, and poor scripting, they’re gonna have to rely on luck for this one. They face a tall task, which could prove to be problematic for such a short team. Their fate rests in Shortgamer’s hands.  0:35 the Knights of McDee table must assemble in order to destroy the evil that is known as minecraft. They now have to gather all their knowledge of the game that still remains after their venture through the hills of grovel offensive. Keyboard in hand, they look to reclaim the land.  0:39 With their senses impaired and their backs against the wall, this can only be a success for the team with a dream to win. with the power of an Earth-Quake, the osu! skills to make enemies shake, and half the team half baked, nothing in the world can stop this crew.  0:44 So many questions trouble this young squad. Can Raven stay atop his tower? Is his name ChickMang or Chicken? Can Learning learn to win? Is Scriblur still master of everything ever? Only time can tell.  0:49 With the Burtroop off on vacation, the birch tree himself found replacements, a texture maker, a pirate, and a swede. Their archer skills may be lacking, but its unimportant, a wise man once said, “Dosen’t Matter, Sword rush”.  0:53 After a long hiatus, solgoat returns to once again join his partner in crime for one more adventure. among with them come the blind killer and the man who leaves his enemies useless. They look to step away from their comfort zones of caves and mcsg to bring a long term veteran and his first victory.  KOKE I DID IT"

I feel like the one place I can always trust and talk to is this community, so here's my story of the past 2 weeks.  http://pastebin.com/mVscv2p9  I didn't really know how to shorten it, but if it want a brief idea, I was thrown out of my house 2 weeks ago, I has no other option than to go back home the following day, but after some events, I left the house and i am now currently waiting on a flat to come up.  Soon I will be living on my own, as well as doing school work, and trying to maintain a social life.  I think it will be extremely hard for me to come back to hosting or playing games. I will have very little time on my hands, because I really want to work on my art and music again.  The only reason I first spoke to someone about how I felt was because of this community, and i will never be able to thank it enough. In times of me being lonely, I knew I always had a great group of friends that I could rely on, thank you.  If anyone is interested, Cyburgh will be staying up for as long as the hosts keep hosting. I may return to developing the servers if I get time, but I really can't say for sure.  Thank you UHC community, you changed me, for the better. Here's to a brighter future.

ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,bitlington,5,Sun Jul 12 22:53:36 2015 UTC,"With badlion increased ore rates, 1/2 Ores would be fun, less people would be full diamond after caving.   Always been a big fan of big Skyhigh games, 300 Man Skyhigh might possibly make myself wet."
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,MooshC,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:37:43 2015 UTC,can confirm would be pretty wet
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,Prateon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:39:19 2015 UTC,"I just looked at the scenario. How would that work. Would we have to generate a 100x100 that is already above y-104. I mean sky basing would have to be allowed. Do people go and just bow fight like that, or do I spawn in a giant platform or? As for the 1/2 ores, does it just have a 50/50 chance, or does the server have to check that a player is mining diamonds, and then starts making a tally of true and false for the diamonds they mine?"
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,bitlington,4,Sun Jul 12 23:45:33 2015 UTC,"For 1/2 Ores, every other ore gives drops. 50/50 is 50%. Double or nothing, is when you mine it is 50% you get it, x/, or not.   Skyhigh is fun for the sole reason, you get to tower and sky base. No structure built by host; usually host gives a bow or two strings, and items to make 2 snowmen so players can farm. Good luck slutty"
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,Joesreddit,2,Sun Jul 12 23:57:18 2015 UTC,"A 200+ player skywars would be crazy long, it may well also lag the server and players a great deal!"
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,bitlington,4,Mon Jul 13 00:05:32 2015 UTC,But it would be fun nonetheless.
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,Prateon,3,Mon Jul 13 01:25:29 2015 UTC,I think it would be extremely fun. Not all games have to be 250> players. I personally am in favor of having smaller games on a weekly basis. Yes - less people can get on. Yes - it excludes nondonors/non active badlion uhcers. However it's an interesting twist.
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,Prateon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:48:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah. 1/2 doesn't seem to appealing to me since it'll just encourage x-ray. People on badlion at 100x100 expect diamond filled fights, and I dont want to remove that.   Skyhigh seems fun, and i told gberry and the devs to start up on that."
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,bitlington,2,Mon Jul 13 03:55:10 2015 UTC,"Also make sure to stop lag machines, they hurt people FPS bad. Hopefully you can fight issues such as that.   When you're done, I got some more scenarios which would be epic as badlion games."

ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,Prateon,2,Mon Jul 13 00:43:55 2015 UTC,"Ohh, I'd really like that. I brought it up to devs. This and blood diamonds are going to be in the works as new gamemodes."
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,dans1988,5,Mon Jul 13 03:54:12 2015 UTC,"In UHCs disallow 10 minute heals and remove starter food.  I think you've raised mob caps recently (or I just started seeing more mobs), which I'm quite happy with."

ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,dans1988,3,Mon Jul 13 13:25:46 2015 UTC,I did!
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,Prateon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:26:11 2015 UTC,"The 10 minute heals and starter food have already become so consistent that it is part of what makes badlion uhc brand. In all honesty it just makes the game more competitive since players can be extremely risky and go caving at an earlier point. Watch smqcked or itsdenis or officialchanses streams and you see they don't even bother getting too much food, and go straight to caving the moment they get some apples."
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,dans1988,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:31:30 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it's a mistake to make the game (which is supposed to be a hard one) easier by giving free items/heals to players. That said, those are the only two things that actually bother me on Badlion.     it is part of what makes badlion uhc brand   I can't disagree with this part."
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,Prateon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree completely it's a mistake. I have tried on multiple occasions to change it to no food or heal. When badlion uhc first game out it was extremely laggy, with 250 players there was a constant 12~ tps. This led to damage being given unfairly, so to compensate we gave out starter food and a heal. It was a good idea at the time, but still has consequences today. There is no current plan to remove them, but it's become something that players got too accustomed too, and change is impossible. Plus it does generally have a positive outcome in the game. It leads to people going down to caves faster, and getting back up to surface earlier."

ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,anthonyde726,2,Tue Jul 14 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"The only problem i really have with badlion at this point is that you allow alting, other than that i really enjoy the server.  Though i would like to see some phobia gamemodes so its not all about pvp"
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,Prateon,2,Sun Jul 12 23:52:18 2015 UTC,"The thing is it's extremely difficult to moderate who is alting. We can only ban when people tell us that xx is alting, and all it does is encourage witch hunting (which we hate). For the sake of fairness this policy just makes it more fair for the entirety of the player base. XXX shouldn't get caught alting just because he is known, whereas yyy cheats way more then him just isn't known/has more trustworthy friends."
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,anthonyde726,3,Mon Jul 13 03:56:35 2015 UTC,"Deffinetly see where you are coming from, it's just that the fact that you let people alt... It just makes the players feel as if they can X-ray without caring, because they can just alt if they get caught, I've heard from some people, people have reached up to 15 alts (I know you ip ban after a few inncidents but people use non-blocked vpns or something apperently). Also you should sugarcane, updating gravel, and mineshaft rates as they are very high (though this isn't neccisary it would be something nice to fix) and about the phobia gamemodes, I would love to see pyrophobia cryophobia paranoia or mystery teams on badlion tbh. Thanks for responding and modding badlion btw :)"
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,Prateon,2,Mon Jul 13 04:24:09 2015 UTC,"The thing is people already x-ray without caring. I'm going to be blunt about this but there are just as many cheaters (probably more) on reddit then there are on badlion. Feel free to flame as much as you want. Just like reddit probably has the same quantity of false bans as badlion does (ratio wise). We can't catch people if we don't have proof. I've said it before - I'd rather a hacker play, then an innocent player get banned. I still believe in that. I mean for people who change their ips we do the best we can. We ask their friends, we geolocate, we have people who snitch. But sometimes it just isn't enough to prove. We ban 95% of vpns, and the only ones that are left are past the second page google, and are all paid.   As for the gravel and mineshaft rates  Pyrophobia may never be a badlion gamemode. Same for mystery teams. It's just too big and there is zero real demand for it on badlion. The thing about badlion is that the playerbase is 50% new players 45% regular players and 5% dedicated entirely to badlion adn will tryhard their asses off [shoutout to @badliontryhard on twitter]. We don't want to place players in a situation of shear confusion/difficulty. However we are constantly working of facilitating the new player experience and soon things like /uhc rules, and other automated features are planned to be released soon."
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,anthonyde726,2,Mon Jul 13 05:45:53 2015 UTC,"I agree there are more cheaters, that doesn't offend me, and I guess you guys can't do anything about it  3.1 sounds actually fun again (badlion bores me rn with full diamond every game from people)  Also I can see why you wouldn't host those game modes, but I would just find them fun :P  Tbh cryophobia would be really cool on bl doe"

It gives you some breathing room if you are getting ganked. I mean sure chugging is a horrible thing but I've seen people like smqcked get into the 100x100 border, get juggled by a team of 3 and still survive.   I mean if the demand is enough (I'm posting a similar thread on the July 13th, 2015 community post but I'll post it right at 5 pm est), I am more then willing to add a game or two a day that is absorptionless."

ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,Prateon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:21:27 2015 UTC,"Oh you're right. For this first trial I'm making donor only. It sucks, but that's just how the cookie crumbles. If it goes well then I'm making it so that the moment players are able to join I'll remove whitelist. This means two things. Firstly donors and non-donors have an equal chance of joining. Secondly there won't be a scheduled whitelist off time, so it'll be completely random and whoever is the most dedicated and spamming it will be able to play.   But just to repeat myself - the game today will most likely be donor filled."
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,VernonN,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"These are all UHC-related:  New gamemodes such as Best PvE, Blood Diamonds, Potiental Hearts.  As for improvements to the current games, I would like more variety in having heads on/off, absorption on/off and heads stacking. I'd also like to see starter food removed and editing the saturation fix, I feel like it should stay the same, not make you extremely hungry as soon as you take damage. This will be controversial and you probably won't like it, but: make donators join after normal players. Non-donators barely ever can get in games, especially FFA's, and if you let normal players join first and then have unlimited slots for donators, everyone can play. It might lead to more TPS lag though, which is the problem I can see with it (and more players)"
ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,Prateon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:20:06 2015 UTC,"You've said all the things that we don't plan on changing. I really do make an effort to make games more accessible by hosting a higher quantity of games, adding the ability for Lion/famous/twitch to whitelist two players. As for the whole food ordeal, don't take damage. We have no plans on removing the starter food.  Lastly we will try to add more absorptionless and head on/off gamemodes, but this is something that will have to be planned into the schedule, so you won't see it for a week or so."

The difficulty with badlion is finding something that keeps the game interesting, whilst not angering the playerbase. Hard to find a middleground."

That was a year ago.  For what you have said, it definately seems like he can fit in with people nicely. It is impossible for someone to fit in entirely with everyone, so I think you should probably stick to that group of people with him and introduce new people as time goes, until he works by himself on finding friends in here.

ultrahardcore,3d1u1l,Mrsonicfan3200,2,Mon Jul 13 15:06:47 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck, hosted a rto5 moles mumble game today, I got put on a team with megahero, majorminer, bjrs and Dankei/Gafloff. It was really fun when we started off as mega started playing dank memes through the mic then we split off into our separate ways and I found 17 diamonds and made 3/4 diamond with it, missing leggings.  I then went on to find 45 gold and then my cave ended so I decided to go nether, strength was off though and so was tier 2 so I got 2 rods just to speed up the brewing of speed for us. We had all met up apart from megahero so we started to have suspicions on him and what made us more to think he was mole as people in the chat were saying that they saw him with the mole team.  Me and major got horses and I gave away my diamond boots to Dankei/Gafloff and then we were off to 0,0 but on the way I fell into a ravine so used all my healing up. As me and major has splash speed we splashed our horses so they went really fast.   The first team we encounter at 0,0 was the mole team which were stacked on gear too and also have pots themselves, and we also see our old teammate - Megahero. The fight started off with a bow fight until me and major rushed in on our horses to get short range and as our horses were too fast from the speed it was hard to hit them. I then got in a horse melee fight with megahero and killed him, then went and killed another mole, zachattack, but sonicfan runs.   Me, Dankei and bj chase him but Dankei dies because he was really low and so does bj because I accidentally shoot him in the process of killing sonicfan so he dies, in the shock of it all I don't know what's going on so sonic combos me on 10% and when I hit him it still took 2 shots to kill him because full diamond and God armour = tank.  Then it's me, majorminer (my teammate) and miles, however major is noob and forgets miles is alive so he starts attacking me thinking it's over, luckily I combo' him and ran back telling him miles was still alive, miles then comes out of nowhere and kills major because he and I were really low. I run because of how low I am and then get in a medium range bow fight with miles and kill him then end up winning the game. It was a lot more fucking intense/funny if you were actually there to play it and yeah, that's how I won a mumble game earlier :D  edit: HOLY FUCKING SHIT THAT WAS A LOT OF WRITING"

I took a look at it and thought that something like this could be used as a ""all in one package"" solution for someone who needs a quick and dirty prefix system. Although I do not recommend using a Skript to handle your chat and say that you should use something like PEX/GroupManager and a real chat plugin, this is a good one-stop solution if you just want prefixes and want it now.  Some advice/criticism I would give you:   Keep things inside as few variables as possible, lists are great for this Try not to mix spaces and tabs, your options at the top use spaces while the rest of the skript uses tabs Try not to make everything have a sound. People don't like this. Administrative tasks (like assigning prefixes) should only show it to the command sender, not broadcast it to everyone   If you'd like to see my changes, I published them here.

ultrahardcore,3d006s,Ratchet6859,2,Sun Jul 12 09:35:05 2015 UTC,"Aureus Pupillam's Curse of the Defending Champion  BreakSalad, Winner of Season 1: He found a group of diamonds in season 2, and plenty of gold. He had a severe lagspike which gave him grief throughout the game. It eventually  became a time loop thing where he couldn't craft torches, allowing Joey to sneak up on him and shoot him a bunch. His head was found in lava by Joey :(  BloodStinger745, Winner of Season 1: He managed to use his Irish powers/ luck with caves to get a ton of grapples, and a power 3/4 bow. He participated in the final battle and almost killed Ssiafs(3% away) but a combination of Ssiafs' full diamond, power 4, a failed ender pearl, and most of all, Blood running out of arrows led to his first and only loss.  Ssiafs, Winner of Season 2: He was teamed with team-killer Zarky and Geist. Geist was knocked down to 45 within the first episode. After healing him a bit, they fought a team where both Zarky and Geist shot Ssiafs. A third team came and whittled their health, so they were forced to retreat. Ssiafs started happily killing skeletons, and eventually died to a spider. Zarky and Geist fought Scope's team on the hill(after a brief period of firing at each other), and Zarky shot Geist and died to Scope who had managed to successfully scale the hill.  BreakSalad, Winner of Season 3: He was on team Handicapped, tx and Heralen dug down; Heralen had a baby zombie attack him, tx a creeper that killed him. They managed to get a protection 3 diamond chest for Heralen. The first team they encountered heavily overpowered them and managed to kill Heralen. Break died to Nils, and Tyler avenged him only to be hunted down by Kittens(this sounded much more epic in my head).  ScOpe_H3ad and SeargentGnome, Winners of Season 3: The team antagonized Krenz who was not a happy panda by killing Zarky and CMatt's gaze causing Ssiafs to pull a VintageBeef/DeRockProject. CMatt was knocked down to 4 by Zarky and after a fight, the team was attacked while preparing to anvil. Scope later died when he had a frame drop and Krenz shot an arrow. CMatt was hunted down and mauled by Krenz. Gnome knocked Krenz off a hill but Krenz water dropped and lived. Gnome lagged against Fairy and Krenz resulting in his death. Luke managed to kill Fairy after Krenz forgot how to water bucket, and he later healed up and died to Geist.  sneegsnag, Winner of Season 4: Ginger was almost late to the game. He found a temple with 5 diamonds in the first episode, and they later found a mineshaft with several loot chests. Despite this early luck he and Ginger still died to Eirene and Zarky(dae when Ginger was bad).  Maddognils, Winner of Season 4: Science, Bitch found an early temple and early skellie damage. They found a mineshaft where Nils got poisoned by a cave spider. He healed twice only for them to encounter enchanted Zarky and Eirene who shot him to death before his bow broke. Crimson escaped with battle wounds and healed up a bit(and got enchanted). He tried to enter the final battle, only for Learning to deny him.  FTWkittens, Winner of Season 4: They found a solo, unenchanted Neo and killed him with little damage. Dibz and him later pissed off Krenz(these people never learn). Krenz killed Dibz while trying to escape. Kittens nearly killed Short only for Krenz to take the death, allowing Short to survive and kill Kittens.  ShutUpBrick, Winner of Season 4: He and bag managed to get heavily geared up. They dispatched of Joey and Sugar with relative ease, but Brick decided to melee Sugar and got near death. They escaped Eirene and Zarky  only to run into Bait and Hook. Jake managed to sneak up and killed bag. Brick tried fleeing Joey, but he was unable to escape the laggy Aussie.  Like the montage, pretend season 6 never happened, and Krenz doesn't defy the laws of physics and reddit recorded founds, and fake Joey don't get kills  Krenzinator, Winner of Seasons 5 and 6: He was the first of his team to die, as he encountered an enchanted sneeg and fought him despite being on his own(should've used them status reports). The rest survived until they found WMC Ripoff. Sugar managed to kill Learning, but was whittled down and long shot by CMatt. Fairy enderpearled and killed Winther(the mole), and managed to run. Ryker tried to back him up only for Dibz to combo him into submission. CMatt chased down Fairy and got his revenge from season 2.  TheBestGinger9, Winner of Season 7: He was with Sid and Winther. Sid went by a witch hut and got poisoned. He went caving with Winther while Ginger went on his own. Winther found diamonds with him with her Maw-Ray, and a few seconds later Sid was caught off guard by Zarky(of all people) and died to him. Winther nearly escaped only to run into a Ssiafs, feeding him another kill. Ginger later found a mineshaft and got insane diamond gear. He managed to kill Dibz but lost a ton of health. He later ran into Zarky and Ssiafs  and reduced Zarky to 5% before feeding Ssiafs another kill.  Hollymatman, Winner of Season 7: His team successfully nethered and got potions, but they couldn't make strength, resulting in only having speed. They didn't obtain much gold for healing, which ended up being a mistake. They engaged Brick and Heralen, where Brick managed to kill sneeg with an impressive fire arrow.  They escaped and tried backstabbing Quality Zennikers, only for Holly to fall to Jake(despite Fairy's intervention with an epic 3 heart poison pot on Tommy). Quake escaped and re-engaged Jake(who lost Tommy and Joey to Mad Saint  Potion- Master Juice), who escaped. Quake then fought against Heralen and Brick with Jake trying to sneak in a kill. Quake managed to kill Jake and later Zarky only to fall, get hit with a flame arrow, and die to Ssiafs.     So the tab was quite colorful(every team got a kill!), thanks for another season in addition to the badass intro. Good luck to Zarky, Ssiafs, Kurt, Joey, MoP, and Short(if he plays again), it won't make a difference!"

The struggles of fighting against the environment not killing each other, and learning how to adjust to a game that isn’t CS:GO lie ahead for our heroes  0:25 One newcomer, and three others already familiar with the battlefield, their journey to locate and order corn will be treacherous, and long. But with the will of Tony on their side, they may just have what it takes to endure it.  0:30 Plagued by their inability to melee, below average bow skills, and poor scripting, they’re gonna have to rely on luck for this one. They face a tall task, which could prove to be problematic for such a short team. Their fate rests in Shortgamer’s hands.  0:35 the Knights of McDee table must assemble in order to destroy the evil that is known as minecraft. They now have to gather all their knowledge of the game that still remains after their venture through the hills of grovel offensive. Keyboard in hand, they look to reclaim the land.  0:39 With their senses impaired and their backs against the wall, this can only be a success for the team with a dream to win. with the power of an Earth-Quake, the osu! skills to make enemies shake, and half the team half baked, nothing in the world can stop this crew.  0:44 So many questions trouble this young squad. Can Raven stay atop his tower? Is his name ChickMang or Chicken? Can Learning learn to win? Is Scriblur still master of everything ever? Only time can tell.  0:49 With the Burtroop off on vacation, the birch tree himself found replacements, a texture maker, a pirate, and a swede. Their archer skills may be lacking, but its unimportant, a wise man once said, “Dosen’t Matter, Sword rush”.  Second Time"

But I'm going to give you guys a little insight on my friend, Blaszczak. So over the past month of having a very body draining cancer, he is been pulling massive clutches to hold on and then put up with hate from people for 'faking' it. A few days ago he stopped breathing for about 2 minutes and doctors told me that he won't make It past that day. He's lived 5 more days and is continuing to prove people wrong. But about 1.5 weeks ago. He got paralyzed from the waste down. Today. His legs were removed. He told me yesterday he's fighting just for me now and I've been trying to tell him that you aren't fighting for me, you're fighting because you want to live.   TLDR: Blaszczak is living atm and he's fighting off this horrible cancer and hopefully he can live as long as we hope :D  Blas wanted me to remove a part of it for avoiding things, sorry."

ultrahardcore,3cubfu,NightWolf105,11,Fri Jul 10 22:14:14 2015 UTC,"So, here's something I want to ask you all about.  7 Months and 8 days ago, Iron Wolf went under a temporary suspension due to it being too much of a burden on my life and me not having the ability to run it as well as it deserved due to other things like schooling and work taking over. There are plans to bring it back, but now is not the time for it, and the time that would be ready is unsure.  As such, many people miss the Meetup Simulator for how long it has been gone. Here's my question, what do you guys think about Meetup Simulator coming back on TwittUHC? It would not be nearly as much of a burden on my life as it is now due to their staff being able to handle the cheaters, as well as many other tools that are available to stop cheaters.  The gamemode would not be changed, there would not be any kind of donator benefits on it, and it would be its old classic self. What do you guys think?  (And clarification, when Iron Wolf comes back at some time in the future, Meetup Simulator will be there. <3)"

So in some games I've started to mess around a bit, not like pissing off the host and suiciding or excessively stalking, but doing fun things like making traps, skybasing, or even just making a house at 0.0. So if anyone finds themselves getting bored of UHC. Try doing something I've suggested above, one of the most fun things I've ever done was skybasing with /u/MrQamboy and /u/SambowMC  TLDR: If you're getting bored of UHC, Do something fun in a game :D"

ultrahardcore,3cubfu,bucklakeluki,6,Fri Jul 10 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"The UHC Bible  In a time before our own there was nothing but a great void of darkness. The time before our own was very different to what we feel, see and experience today. There was nothing; no subreddit, no servers, no players. It all began when Aubron the Great created /r/ultrahardcore; a way of life that captured the hearts of its followers.  Aubron said: let there be a subreddit; and there was a subreddit. And it was good. And that concluded the first day. Aubron said: Let there be servers: and there were servers. And they were good. And that concluded the second day. Aubron said: Let there be moderators, and there were moderators, and it was good. And that concluded the third day. The moderators brought a BIG problem to the attention of Aubron The Magnificent; all the UHC games were empty! There was no one to play inside them (except the moderators) This was a BIG problem and Aubron did not know what to do. The moderators advised Aubron that they would need to seek a BIG solution. Aubron pondered in deep thought into the early hours of the morning.  He called for his second follower: Dibzcraft, but Dibzcraft did not hear because Aubron's voice did not produce a BIG enough sound to summon Dibzcraft. He told the moderators that they should share and spread UHC to attract potential players. So the moderators and Aubron did this.  No sooner had they done so, players began to fill up servers and even made servers of their own, however there were still so many empty servers. By a BIG coincidence the moderators bumped into CutClean and Aubron who then asked if CutClean could help. CutClean said this would require a BIG consideration on his part and that we would inbox them.  Players continued to join and on the fifth day Aubron recieved a BIG message from Aubron but his inbox was too small so he could not open the message. Luckily CutClean predicted this and came to meet Aubron and the moderators in person. He told them he had a BIG influence and would use it to attract more players. On the sixth day, so many of the UHC servers were full and they gave praise to the Tremendous Three; Aubron the Magnificent, CutClean and The Moderators. They later became known as the Amazing Three. Players would give tribute, some in the form of throwing themselves into the Amazing Three as tribute, they called this AP after the Amazing Players. The player that the Amazing Three's blessing shined down the most on was a player called xNestorio, he was good and kind and loving. He always gave APs whenever he played without prompt. On the seventh day, the Tremendous Three rested. However, there was evil brewing. Little did Aubron and the moderators know but CutClean had BIG plans. He wanted players only to give tribute to him and to look up to him. There was going to be a BIG betrayal.  CutClean befriended a player called KatManKhaos and whispered poisonous lies into his ear. He told him that he would be an instrument to the rise of a new UHC era and would join CutClean at the helm.  However, Aubron saw the growing power of UHC and feared that one day the players would rise against the Amazing Players and no longer believe in them and show disrespekt. So he went into hiding, only to come out of his shell to appoint a every once in a while in order to lead the people and preach to them the teachings of the UHCBible. Little did he know, in his absense CutClean forged a plan: to create a new era of games...  Thus concludes the Book of UHC: Chapter One"

ultrahardcore,3ctxxo,silverteeth,7,Fri Jul 10 19:25:04 2015 UTC,"What are you gonna do with ginger? he's going to get banned on badlion for xraying... I'm guessing though that he'll get the ban after that game. imo he doesn't desrve to play this game if this is what he do... why would a player like that, that did such awful stuffs lately and stupid stuff should participate in this kind of a big event. and think about it like that, if he wasn't streaming, he would keep xraying and no one would stop him. also, in he's appeal (sort of on skype) he lied about what he did... "" I didn't dig to anything and I didn't benefit at all from it"" http://prntscr.com/7rbmux Lie to someone eles. please don't let ginger play it, after all he did, I don't see any reason why he should play a game like that."

Hereby I'd like to introduce myself a bit; bear with me.   I go by the name of APACHE. Until this point I've only played multiplayer Minecraft on Hypixel. I have great insecurities considering my melee skill and quick mid-fight decision-making, but I try to make up for that with my overall strategy and bow skills. I'm involved in the general development and updating of Hypixel's UHC. I kinda feel however that my time has come to step away from the softcore, quick-action scene and move to the more hardcore, raw pvp experience. That's why I'd love to get involved with you guys!  I'll try to keep my eye on the Match Calendars and who knows.. you might see me with a squad of top Hypixel UHC players appear in a proper UHC game soon! I'm curious how we'd match up ^  See you all around!"

Like she told me to ask my parents as more of a hope thing that'd never happen... Like when she tells me to come over even though I'm in Ireland and she's in Germany... But surprisingly they let me. So I went there... Got to see her house... Her town... Her room... Meet her cat... Meet her family and like wow. I only ever saw her room on Snapchat and only saw her family once or twice. Her cat I only saw on Snapchat too (that cat also seemed to love me so yay), I did not expect that when I woke up this morning. She's still coming here too as well at the weekend so yes ^-^  I'm so happy right now to be honest. It was very hard to get to where she was but so worth it, she was so shocked when I showed up lol. We then sat at a bus stop for half an hour and talked and cuddled and stuffs and then went to her house and her room and yes  Idk sorry for bragging I'm just so fucking happy"

ultrahardcore,3cqk13,SnoopSean,-1,Thu Jul 9 23:52:32 2015 UTC,"Technically, snowball in figurative terms means that the situation gets more and more ridiculous the farther it progresses.  So, let's say someone is rushing mid with iron armor and an iron sword, then he gets enchants from one kill. Then he gets a golden head and eats it, then he kills another guy.  This guy has some diamonds, so he is able to craft armor, and e.t.c.  The reason why it's so annoying is that it's so effective and so widely used, it's not exactly like the 'old days' of UHC, where it was tougher to snowball, but now it's easy and effective, and more interesting for the player."

My depression has been hitting really hard recently, and I've been having some suicidal thoughts. I've gotten fed up. I went to a doctor today and now I've been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Severe Major Depressive Disorder. I can only assume more will come as this was just the first visit. I'll be getting medication tomorrow. Hopefully it will help. I've been going to therapy more. I would like to apologize to anyone I've wronged, made fun of, poked at, or just was mean to. I'm not going to blame my illnesses, that's on me. I'm just trying to become a better person. I don't think that I'll be on Minecraft that much anymore. It's been burning me out. I hate it when I get overtly angry over something that just seems so silly to me now. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm leaving for a while. I'll play the occasional game with my friends and stick around on the community post, but that's about it. Again, I'm really sorry to anyone that I've made feel like I have these past few years.

I simply stood up, told her to fuck off, then left. I found my head of course, who said something I can't remember and then gave me a book with the joker from batman in it. Then joker appeared by my side. The rest of the dream is pretty hazy...  My acceptance letter finally came through this morning though. It turned out it was just a week late, so I can still go back in August.  So yeah all's good on that front."

While mining I found a zombie dungeon with a gapple, saddle, and horse armor in it. After that, I see a witch in a ravine. I shoot it and it drops a health potion. I finally go up to the surface with two gapples. I had the diamonds to enchant, but not the materials. While searching for sugar cane and leather. I see a player name in a nearby surface cave. I go in and manage to kill the person without taking significant damage. I'm able to heal back up to 8 hearts. The person I killed had enchants. So I could enchant myself, and use my diamonds for armor. I do this, get basic tier 2, and head to 0,0. I managed to get 4 kills, and then got backstabbed while combining a bow. On the bright side it was a double kill. I actually sort of did well in a UHC."

Before that, it had been fire114436 since 2011, when I started playing the game. My first Reddit UHC was sometime in 2013 (I had been watching the Mindcrack UHCs since they started in 2012.) So I played a game and didn't come back until around the beginning of 2014, but really started playing in June/July of 2014. I played alot of Fleft's server and later Ironwolf, just trying to get better at PVPing in UHC. I played a lot of games and enjoyed it. I've been kind of off and on in terms of playing UHC lately, but still watch most recorded rounds (WMC is my favorite :D)  I haven't really made any friends in the community (and there aren't many random teams games anymore), but I'd still like to thank everyone here for hosting, playing, and uploading videos. So, thank you."

Can someone like explain what that means? I'm a bit confused, I've played this game for a long time but never heard of that"
ultrahardcore,3ch077,bitlington,3,Tue Jul 7 21:10:25 2015 UTC,"chugging = eating as much healing as you can in attempt to survive (badlion has absorption 90% of the time and it's not uncommon to get half a stack of golden heads/golden apples)  sweating = trying hard  neither of them are actually logical, because in UHC everyone's trying to win, that's the goal, and using the healing you've earned isn't exactly a bad thing"
ultrahardcore,3ch077,MrCraftLP,3,Tue Jul 7 21:13:55 2015 UTC,"Don't know what chugging is, but sweating is basically a term used for people who try their hardest at the game and get loads of kills. I suppose it's the minecraft equivalent to working out so hard that you sweat a ton.  Edit: I'm not sure of this, but chugging may be what it is called when someone is so stacked up on golden apples that they can eat them nonstop."
ultrahardcore,3ch077,Drake132667596,2,Tue Jul 7 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"Chugging is a derogatory term used on mostly on Badlion to indicate that such player directed at is in the act of eating many golden apples.   ""Chugging"" is very frowned upon due to, getting many golden apples in the first place is not always the easiest and for the fact it makes killing the player, a much harder task."
ultrahardcore,3ch077,seanduckman,3,Tue Jul 7 21:15:56 2015 UTC,"Chugging is basically eating as many gapples as you can in a melee fight, and on badlion, you can have up to 10 gapples just from caving alone due to upped ore rates."

ultrahardcore,3ch077,BadAnt,2,Wed Jul 8 01:59:21 2015 UTC,"I don't really know what to do right now :(  My granddad has been hospitalised for the few days due to an infection that he had to his heart. He has had this in the past and had an operation 3 years ago, which unfortunately turned for the worst. He has never really been the same since. He had to undergo about a year of working back up to his normal self but unfortunately he has never got back to being active in the way that he used to. Now forced to use a walking stick, instead of being that man who played football with me when I was young, that man who went on 20 mile hikes every weekend, that man who was always there for me.   The infection that forced him to undergo this operation came back last thursday. My nan took him to the GP and they said nothing was wrong, it was just a fever. However it was not. She phoned the hospital and they sent out a paramedic. I do not want to go into details but basically he is not well enough to undergo another operation. The infection has spread to his brain and the hospital have said that he has a maximum of 48 hours left.  So I just wanted to say this so that you guys know why I may not be myself in the days to come but I'm just going to hope for the best, although it does seem that there is only way that this could go at the moment.  Thanks for reading this i guess."

We then saw some teams fighting, but got sword rushed by a team with potions. They killed one of us, but I killed them all. We then got pretty much everything we needed to win; golden heads, potions, and stronger bows. It was then just us and another 2 team, but that team had full diamond and was camping on a mountain.

He carried me unbelievably hard and got 10 kills, i got 0 with about 1 shot gotten, thus my first UHC win :D    fx was really cool and linked me to brian's match calendar which i used for over a year, fun times!"

ultrahardcore,3cgmru,VengefulZed,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:47:22 2015 UTC,That's good

ultrahardcore,3cgmru,nimmin13,2,Tue Jul 7 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"I've seen a couple of complaints about the 1.9 update, which is odd because I remember people complaining about the 1.8 update and how the enchantment system will be broken for UHC and how easy it'll be to get a level 30 enchantment, etc. Yet I've seen come complaints about the newest update (1.9) and people were complaining about the arrows being updated to have potion effects, or duel wielding swords, and adding shields, etc.   Personally, I think it'll make UHC even more fun! Because it opens up more options for how players, play the game. So it'll be interesting to say the least, and I can't wait to see the differences."
ultrahardcore,3cgmru,HTharaldTH,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:47:38 2015 UTC,"I believe 1.9 will make UHC waaaay more fun! It will cause players to adjust their strategies and force them to use more thinking when gearing up instead of ""I think this game we should hmm go mining and um get diamonds and, yeah, that's all."""
ultrahardcore,3cgmru,bananasash,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:56:59 2015 UTC,"instead of ""I think this game we should hmm go mining and um get diamonds and, yeah, that's all.""   Or   I think we should get some early kills then go caving   or   I think that we should get 2 gapples each then go mid   There's quite a few other strats that you can currently use and 1.9 won't open up much."
ultrahardcore,3cgmru,TheBananaMonster12,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:50:38 2015 UTC,"I was exaggerating a bit but 1.9 will offer a lot more choices for combat, adding even more strategies to the bunch."

ultrahardcore,3cgmru,milen323,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:52:06 2015 UTC,I'm willing to try but i just feel i might be overwhelmed with new things and no one will be able to use the new features properly.  1.9 could see a shift of what people call good players as some players may adapt their strategies better than others.
ultrahardcore,3cgmru,meepsire3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:49:16 2015 UTC,Dragon's Den/Dragon Rush will be interesting with the updates to the End
ultrahardcore,3cgmru,milen323,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:55:59 2015 UTC,No sounds stupid tbh. Like poison arrows? What we're they thinking. So smp people could poisen mobs lol. Not going to play in 1.9 for a very long time

ultrahardcore,3cgmru,milen323,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:51:17 2015 UTC,Meh. Your right but Poiswn arrows are a bit too far. Unless they are super hard to craft
ultrahardcore,3cgmru,meepsire3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:11:20 2015 UTC,Yeah there has to be balance. They did announce at Minecon that they're trying to find a way to balance out the potion arrows.
ultrahardcore,3cgmru,milen323,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:28:18 2015 UTC,"Yea if it requires something like a wither skull to make, then sure let's have it. Same thing with the sheilds"
ultrahardcore,3cgmru,meepsire3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:32:47 2015 UTC,I think most games will still be played in 1.7 but none in 1.8 since there is no need for it. Hopefully 1.9 will have better TPS than 1.8 because most people are complaining about having lots of ping lag and they cant play any games
ultrahardcore,3cgmru,SnoopSean,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:21:59 2015 UTC,1.8 is better for ping...
ultrahardcore,3cgmru,DankMemeDepot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:08:57 2015 UTC,"No it isn't people get insane amounts of ping lag. I have experienced in 1.7 around 90 ping, but when I move to 1.8 the pin says 100=150 and when I get in any server it feels like I am getting around 3000 ping and I can't do anything.

ultrahardcore,3cgmru,TheRealLampBro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:14:18 2015 UTC,Well I can get 120 to us servers and 100 on 1.8 and it feels like I'm on an EU server

ultrahardcore,3cccgi,younggunna642,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:44:06 2015 UTC,"So you use it(I assume by right clicking), and select which trap you want(and it's automagically activated when one of the 4 conditions occurs?)? Or is the effect random? How would you use the trap on someone using a potion/healing, would you use the trap and then have an option to type the player's name?"
ultrahardcore,3cccgi,milen323,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:51:07 2015 UTC,"The effect is randomly chosen when (for ex.) you shoot a player.  So i could drink a speed potion, but it would apply slowness 2 for 15 seconds. Its only a 1 time use and when you kill someone, you get another one. It could be chosen though, in the heat of the moment it would be hard to choose."

Without you, I probably never would have spoken to anyone online.  /u/Fraser_J - My first proper friend in the communtiy. You are an amazingly nice guy, who I feel I can open up to. You introduced me to so many new people in Vitality SMP, I cannot thank you enough.   /u/greengecks - One of my first friends and greatest friends still, you are always there to speak to.   /u/jostein97 - Despite our falling out, you were my bf for a while, and I often found myself looking forward to speaking to you. You also gave me permission to host on your server, so thank you for that.  /u/LukeGregory - Practically hosted my RR for me then accepted my apology after I was a prick to you. You were always a great buddarino and still are.  /u/schmeon1 - You are extremely funny and enjoyable to talk to, even though you do get a little mad sometimes.  /u/DECTHEELITE - Because everyone needs a bud to watch Game of Thrones with.

They all complain about their families. Either their parents are abusive, neglective, or divorced or passed away. Today, I had a fight with my family, it wasn't serious, just everyone was mad at everyone. I waited a while, then made up with them so that we could all work together on our basement. I realized this. I am blessed to have such a family relationship that works out so well. I realized that others aren't as blessed as I am. tl;dr Don't take your family for granted, even if they can be hard at times."

Knowing that I tried to really make a quality video (and succeeded) really gives me a boost of happiness. I know I'll be leaving the community, and UHC in general, eventually, and I don't want to be one of those people that deletes all their videos. When I leave, I'd like to keep my videos and hard work, and be able to look back at them and remember the fun times I've had in (so far the year and two months I've been here).   I don't get much feedback because of my sub inactivity, but overall it's pleasing to make content I'm happy with, good to remember those real ""GG"" games, and know in a couple years I'm sure I'll be watching my videos over again."

Pretty much everyone on the courtroom who puts up with quite a bit of crap yet maintain a civil attitude towards those people. Plenty of people, even some of the recognized people, are underappreciated.  To start, /u/bjrs493: he's founded NDU and kept it running, he and Kampel(another one) made the map for S6. He went from the guy who dies to creepers to nearly winning S4 and S6 and winning S5. Outside of that he's one of the most welcoming hosts I've met, rarely gets as hostile and angry as I've seen so many well respected people here get, and is willing to give advice to anyone who asks.  /u/Squattamelon: another one of few welcoming hosts when I became active in games. During his hosting marathon last December/January, if an issue ever arose he easily solved it and didn't lose his temper with those who kept whining in chat(and the time I was with him as a mole and mistook Floobel and him as nonmoles, he laughed it off as opposed to today's typical reaction)  /u/Cybers_: Well there's the whole thing with Cyburg. But mainly, the fact that he does this with IRL issues, and has always been helpful like this. I remember in December when a host(either dans or TG) had to cancel a match and he was there to back that host up by providing a game. This honestly is why I respect the guy to this day.  TheSonicJoey: despite IRL stuff, he's uploaded his RR's and his individual SSBB play through. When he hosted, he was as level headed as he was aware of cheating(and he didn't have specs afaik).   Ninja edit: Kidfierce/Guyfierce- founded Integrity(granted some people's inactivity/ not uploading got it canceled), and one of the first guys I teamed with who was calm and friendly(thought that could've been his attempt to conceal the fact that he was a mole). In another game that we teamed together, he made sure that we stuck together and despite me getting knocked down to 1 heart by a spider jockey, wasn't hostile or condescending(unlike most people in games nowadays).     Still, most of these posts mean nothing. There are plenty of times where I encounter someone who's ""one of the nicest people here"" and they end up being a complete jackass. And then I see a bunch of people on the community post who are never mentioned on these who make r/ultrahardcore feel like a welcoming place."

It's a bit off-topic, but I think it fits the post well.  My story. The story of, at the time, a 15 16 year old teenager, new to sandbox games.  Around 3 years ago, I started playing Minecraft, offline because:   No money at that time. And yeah, no money.   It was fine. I was never a multiplayer guy - although I met the limits of Survival really quickly. Even on my toaster laptop back then, Survival was never really an issue.  Fast forward 1 year, and I find the Reddit UHC community after watching Mindcrack...I think? Something like that. But oh no, our main character has no real account.  But light shined down as his friend gives him access to his account. ""Eckadt"" was the name, and so was the reddit, that however went unused for all the years.  I do not remember the host of my first game. All I know is that I died unenchanted to SpazzyTheGeek (now known as exetonline I think, is he still even in the community?) in 2/4 or 3/4 diamond, in a cold river under a tree, either Taiga or Ice Plains nearby. The second game I play, a game where I just after joining find out that it is a Teams of Two, I meet him again. Do you want to team? I'm new, looking for some friends...  He said yes. And he carried me, as expected. We unfortunalty died in the first fight, as I was - again, as expected - really bad at PvP. But it was fun.  But...oh no! Our friends account gets hacked! It wasn't a good idea to have the password as the username, but that was not my decision to make. But , the money issue was also solved a few months earlier.  We find ourselfes at the Mojang website and our character thinks of a name.   ""Damn, no ideas, as usual. Hold on a second Paul, you say 'Damn' quite a lot...Shitballs, taken.""  Let's add an X and replace the a with a 4."

ultrahardcore,3c8aso,DaPenguin19,8,Mon Jul 6 03:24:28 2015 UTC,"I have tried for over 5 months to make Blizzard a server that people would enjoy playing on. Blizzard had become a server I loved. But people were giving it so much shit. And I do agree that some games on Blizzard are poorly hosted. That there isnt much variety of gamemodes. I tried to talk to the people who were the reason of all the complaints about Blizzard I have had to read during the past weeks. They dont care about what people think of the server and the games hosted on it. ""We are still getting good fills, we dont see a problem here."" And this why I left Blizzard today. Because I try to improve the server as much as possible, but the other staff just dont want to cooperate."
ultrahardcore,3c8aso,milen323,12,Sun Jul 5 23:10:32 2015 UTC,The reason it's hated is the staff is immature af
ultrahardcore,3c8aso,friigiid,5,Sun Jul 5 23:49:52 2015 UTC,":c  Atleast you know how to fix its problems, I hope you find another server that others will cooperate with you on, you seem to know what you're doing and I wish you good luck in future hosting :)"
ultrahardcore,3c8aso,Itz_Isaac,3,Sun Jul 5 23:47:53 2015 UTC,"well I know im not mature, We all started blizzard to make more friends that was working for a while until I Started getting my temper I Know im not nice and all but I still have a soul, I Have a lot of reasons why I have a high temper I have anger and trust issues That I have been trying to fix for over 5 years but I just cant manage and my parents arean't helping me with there fighting evry minute, I Hope you understand me and think of me differently now, From now on im going to be a new person, I Am sorry for all I have done and will do I hope you forgive me and Gl in future jobs and being a new host. (Even Though we have split up and have our difference you still would be one of the nicest people I met) (I Know notice how much cutclean games I host And i'm gonna start hosting actual UHC Gamemodes but I still will host some USC Games ill just take my time and split up)"
ultrahardcore,3c8aso,Vile_Dragon,2,Mon Jul 6 18:44:52 2015 UTC,To be completely honest I've been feeling the exact same over the past few years.The thing that is worse is that my parents are divorced and my Dad and step mum are always fighting about me spending too much time on my computer and my step dad is just a dick head in general.Most of the time I just hide in a different room to avoid everyone else in my house in case an argument breaks out ;-;
ultrahardcore,3c8aso,andrewbaseball99,6,Mon Jul 6 21:34:15 2015 UTC,"""We are still getting good fills, we dont see a problem here.""   That was because they hosted a lot of cutclean right?"

ultrahardcore,3c6ru1,Wingnut45,2,Sun Jul 5 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"Still doesn't make it bad, sometimes it's nice to relearn something c:"
ultrahardcore,3c6ru1,FSP_Ninja,8,Sun Jul 5 16:39:12 2015 UTC,"I've just looked at 1.9, no thanks. Duel wielding, poison/invis arrows, arrows that make you track people... I think they've gone too far now."
ultrahardcore,3c6ru1,AndrizzlePC,11,Sun Jul 5 14:27:34 2015 UTC,People will adapt to combat these strategies.
ultrahardcore,3c6ru1,criscros88,7,Sun Jul 5 15:29:58 2015 UTC,"The spectral arrows are massively OP, but everything else is kinda neat"
ultrahardcore,3c6ru1,FSP_Ninja,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:45:12 2015 UTC,"If anything the invis arrows will effect the person shooting it more than anything, since it makes the enemy invisible. Or you could shoot it at a teammate, a bit of health to make them invisible for 10 or so seconds. The poison arrows, I don't know. If they have a harder crafting recipe, then that would be pretty cool, or if it only poisoned for like 3 seconds, because the bow (if unenchanted on an unenchanted player) would do 20%, and with the poison for 3 seconds, then it would do around 30-35%, which I guess is reasonable, but if it were any longer it would be overpowered, because it could be like flame, but you can't ""put it out"", unless you have a bucket of milk."
ultrahardcore,3c6ru1,20thPrestigeNoob,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:12:46 2015 UTC,why shoot an invis arrow at someone if the arrow gets stuck in them?
ultrahardcore,3c6ru1,bucklakeluki,5,Mon Jul 6 02:48:08 2015 UTC,"Duel wielding, poison/invis arrows, arrows that make you track people... I think they've gone too far now.   You haven't even given it a chance, if hosts feel like it is a bit too unbalanced (like Strength 2) then they can disable it, but I feel like the upgrade is a needed change and eventually /r/ultrahardcore will be looked at with an eyebrow raised because we are still in 1.7 like 5 updates later.   It's like in the movie Cars where they are stuck in the past"
ultrahardcore,3c6ru1,FSP_Ninja,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"I've just explained about the arrows, but the duel wielding. I have mixed feeling about this. It could work out pretty cool, like having a pickaxe in one hand and a sword in the other, but I was thinking that it might be overpowered as like a lava bucket/flint and steel/fishing rod/negative potion in one hand, and a sword in the other, because then you could do a lot more damage with it. People who are good with fishing rods could do a lot worse combos, since they could be fishing rodding people whilst they are meleeing them. This could create crazy combos. But this is just hypothetical. It could work very well. But this is just my opinion."
ultrahardcore,3c6ru1,bucklakeluki,3,Sun Jul 5 18:20:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, dual wielding weapons is not a feature, anything that has a 'use' feature (right click) can be used along side an attack item (left click), but not 2 'use' items and not 2 'attack' items. So basically when your right click you use the hand designated for the 'use' and left click you use the hand designated for 'attack', so a sword and a bow I will be allowed, but a lava bucket and a flint and steel wouldn't be allowed.    That's what I understood anyways"

ultrahardcore,3c6ru1,Wingnut45,3,Mon Jul 6 06:39:45 2015 UTC,would you rather play in 1.7 forever?
ultrahardcore,3c6ru1,FSP_Ninja,3,Sun Jul 5 15:42:41 2015 UTC,"No, I don't want to stay at 1 update the entire time. To be honest, 1.8 is just bad for those with bad computers, but I think 1.9 has just pushed it. You never know, this community might just stick to 1 update at one point, because eventually there will be a hugely game-breaking update and nobody will update because of it. Technic? Last time I checked it was still in 1.2. Last time I checked was when 1.8 came out."

Courtroom members could still propose rule changes here if they wish to do so.    A scenario post has been discussed many times in the past, but due to several reasons it most likely wouldn't be used much. There's also the issue of only being able to sticky one thread at a time.

ultrahardcore,3c4zdx,Crimson5M,12,Sat Jul 4 21:15:41 2015 UTC,"So in my college course there are 3 years.  I passed the first 2 with flying colours, passing everything on my first attempt (you get maximum of two) with good results, and got along well with all of my lecturers.  Unfortunately they can only accept a few people from the previous year into the next level. Now I was pretty confident that I would get accepted back, and to be honest I kind of need it, otherwise I don't go to university, I have to get a job (I have never had a job and don't have a clue where to begin), and my parents who already see me as just a huge disappointment are gonna pissed.  So anyway, yesterday I was speaking to my friend, and he told me that someone else in our class, who everyone also expected to be accepted back, has been contacted by the college to tell her she has been accepted, as well as three other people.  Now...these three other people, have all failed several assessments on their first attempt, as well as at least one on their second, and two of them had terrible attendance.  Now it could well be that maybe my acceptance letter hasn't arrived yet. However I can't even contact my head lecturer to find out what's happening until the beginning of August, and if I'm lucky some people won't have accepted their place and I'll get in.  But if I actually haven't been accepted, then that's pretty shitty, I was under the impression that to advance to the next level you were supposed to pass the one before it.  So yeah little life advice: No matter how hard you work, how much effort you put in or how good you are, someone worse than you is always gonna achieve better."

Unfortunately they can only accept a few people from the previous year into the next level.   What happens to those who aren't accepted?  Do they retake some stuff or just have to take an alternative course, despite already passing the first 2 levels?    But if I actually haven't been accepted, then that's pretty shitty   And I thought scholarship interviews were bullshit. Is there nobody you can contact/ appeal to if this happens?"
ultrahardcore,3c4zdx,Crimson5M,2,Sat Jul 4 22:24:17 2015 UTC,Nothing. They just don't get in and have to find something else.  And the only person I can contact is the head lecturer for the course but not until the beginning of August.

I have a diamond chestplate, diamond boots, diamond sword and diamond pick, and I have two spare diamonds to make an enchanting table. So I search for ever for cows, forgetting to get rabbit hide, cause 1.8 swagalicious.   Eventually find cows make enchants, then go running around aimlessly looking for another cave, cause like 30 minutes till meetup and no one goes to 0,0 in eximius games.

We're always looking to improve the quality of games, and in my opinion removing the ""oh I got UBL'd, I'll just play on Twitt"" mentality is a huge step forward. Anyone who hacks in one place is highly likely to hack in another, so both of us following the same banlist (with Twitt following an independent ban list as well) can keep our games cleaner and to a higher quality.

But with the will of Tony on their side, they may just have what it takes to endure it.  0:30 Plagued by their inability to melee, below average bow skills, and poor scripting, they’re gonna have to rely on luck for this one. They face a tall task, which could prove to be problematic for such a short team.

They now have to gather all their knowledge of the game that still remains after their venture through the hills of grovel offensive.

Can Raven stay atop his tower? Is his name ChickMang or Chicken? Can Learning learn to win? Is Scriblur still master of everything ever? Only time can tell.  0:49  With the Burtroop off on vacation, the birch tree himself found replacements, a texture maker, a pirate, and a swede.

Water is pouring down profusely.  11:43PM - Water is getting into the house. Only a small amount.  11:44PM - Water is pouring into the house. Emergency services have been contacted.  11:50PM - The entire downstairs of my house is flooded. We're trapped upstairs.  00:00AM - Emergency services contacted again.  00:30AM - Rain stops, water coming through door is slowing down.  00:45AM - We can finally get through the door. Emergency services have not arrived.  00:50AM - Gran arrives at house. She is helping us take things out of our house.  01:00AM - Emergency services are contacted once more.  01:10AM - We go to our Grans house.  01:28AM - At Grans house. Writing this out.

If non-hearing people heard a creeper, you would try to walk away or react to killing it, if you had regular hearing, you do the exact same. If you heard a spider in a staircase to the left and did not have perfect hearing, you would dig to it with the text. If you had regular hearing you would do the same. I think you know what I am trying to say. It only helps them to be like us and be op as shit with op headphones except they have no hearing and they have text, a little bit of a downgrade but they have text, same thing as audio basicly. Also, with people that have no headphones or locational audio, this can help you to, it's not JUST for deaf people, my headphones are a bit out of sync with the left and right so it takes me a bit to know where it is, and I usaully rely on other people to find it unless I just by chance find it but with 1.9 I won't always have to, although I personally find it annoying to have sounds spam my chat but K XD"

ultrahardcore,3bwzbj,TheRealCrazyCallum,6,Thu Jul 2 22:17:06 2015 UTC,"Rant incoming, you've been warned:  Geez man I can only hope that I change schools soon. All of my classmates are just fuckwads for the heck of it and I live kinda far from my school and if I don't get there in time I have to stand in the sun for half an hour until the 2nd period, basically having me be even later if I'm already late. Groupwork is a fifth of my grade for every subject but since it relies so heavily on classmates that really don't give a fuck it's just very frustrating unless I get to be with the people who do care about getting good grades but also happen to not talk to me much. Adding onto that I'm shit at talking to people and saying words or mispronouncing is just so infuriating.   I've said this many times, but thanks to everyone I talk to rather often, you really help me out by just being there and being nice and stuff.   Also my physics teacher was talking about shooting himself in space and throwing cats from buildings so that's cool.  I guess rant over or something"

I said yes, and joined the ts. In this ts I started talking to some of my old friends again and also met some people I always wanted to talk to.  After awhile the people I liked started doing the same shit that made me leave the group in the first place, so I left the skype group completely. During this time I was invited to neonpoop/jamies ts and that is where I usually hang out now. No one in there has pissed me off or made me feel like I didn't belong, and if it weren't for them I probably would have just deactivated my twitter and unsubbed from here.

ultrahardcore,3bu3au,OblivionTU,2,Thu Jul 2 05:34:55 2015 UTC,"That's still good to do since when you do that you super saturate your hunger. Think of there being 20(I think that's the number) extra hunger bars that you can't fill unless you go over the 10 you already have. This can be achieved by eating something like steak when you're only 1 down, so you'll saturate yourself to 13. The other way this is achieved is golden apples, which can push you to the saturation cap."

So when there was the 4 of them left, 32Joe decided to kill both Sleeping and zTaHj for fun, even though they weren't moles. xD Then Eroe comes back from eating dinner and kills Joe. Joe yells at me for not enabling early meetup or permaday (Match length was 90 minutes), and yells at me for being a bad host for sticking to the post. Is this what some people have come to?"

I guess I should start from the beginning, my IGN is SimplySam, you can just call me Sam, and I own Optimus.  We host at least one game every day and currently have a total of 175 hosted, the real reason I wanted to post this is because I wanted some feedback on what the community think of the server and our general hosting ability, I'm also looking for suggestions for the server, if there's anything you think I should add to Optimus, or even an improvement then please, tell me!   I'm still not sure of the date yet, but I'm also going to be looking for a few spectators and possible hosts, the applications will be out soon most likely, but I still have no idea on how soon exactly.

ultrahardcore,3boeb0,KiritoUHC,13,Tue Jun 30 21:58:22 2015 UTC,"Well, there's been something i've needed to get off my chest recently.  Around 3.5 months ago i was dating this girl, she suffered from major depression and should probably not have been in school. For some reason she was super into me, i always saw her as a friend and well, i wanted to help her by going along with it.  We'd been going out for like a couple of hours, and she had already cut her wrist and tried to hang herself, which in all honesty really damn scared me, but i managed to help her get through it.  Until one day. She, for some reason felt like taking her life, by stabbing herself in the heart, which was really damn gruesome to see in hospital. Since it was the easter holidays i sat next to her for at least 6 hours a day, watching her condition deteriorate, knowing that i could have stopped her.  Eventually the inevitable happened and well, i've never felt worse in my life. I started blaming myself for what happened to her, constantly thinking about the ""ifs"" and the ""buts"" every single night since i'll just be lying in bed thinking about the whole thing or i'll be up on my PC trying to forget about her. Hence why i haven't had more than 3 hours sleep since her death.  And hey, i guess i just needed to get it off my chest, the whole things been eating away at me for 3 months and i'm sick and tired of it.  Edit:: On a positive note i have 2 new non-minecraft related series that should be ready to upload this weekend.  Thanks to /u/Learning25 for recommending one of the games."
ultrahardcore,3boeb0,xJesterrr,9,Tue Jun 30 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"When someone has depression it is obviously a horrible thing but there's nothing more you could do man, dont beat yourself up over it. You were there for her.  Talking from experience the thing that helped me most was being able to talk to people and open up. Have someone that I know I could turn to and they'd try their very best to help me out, and those people quite honestly saved my life.  Depression is beyond serious and in some cases worse than others. You should be so proud of yourself for being there for her. Simply reading that made me have a shit ton of respect for you.     TL;DR: Be proud if yourself, you did a great thing and tried your very best. Don't beat yourself up over this cause you did what you could."

ultrahardcore,3bn9ig,Bubblez97,3,Tue Jun 30 16:26:12 2015 UTC,"UHC (Ultra Hardcore) is a Minecraft PvP minigame originally created by Team ""Nancy Drew"" (which is ""Guude"", ""PauseUnpause"", ""VintageBeef"" and ""W92Baj"" - basically a Team inside of The ""Team MindCrack""), where the goal is to be the last player/team standing. Many Features/conditions depend on the host of the game, but NATURAL REGENERATION is always OFF (that means that full hunger bar doesn't recover your health - ""/gamerule naturalRegeneration false""). Taken from Urban dictionary"

I had Minecraft for 2 and a 1/2 years before i found the community but nothing ever gave an adrenaline rush like UHC does. Every time i get a kill or win a game or find diamonds or even have any kind of fun in a game it reminds me why I'm here and why I wont be gone for a long time. I love UHC and all but when i first joined i liked it a little more. I remember around a year ago i didn't have any friends so i played a ton of random teams games. It was really fun seeing the same majority of people over and over again in all these games. The reason i have played so much as of lately? I feel like its coming back. Not to many people play reddit games anymore they never fill. Although this may sound like a bad thing to most? I love it. It's fun getting to fight people that you see all the time. Or getting a rematch fight from a previous game. So lately UHC has been my life. And i really hope that dosn't change."

Umm, this isn't my 2 years of UHC, since I think I've been playing UHCs on the subreddit since about 2 and a half years ago. But I made my reddit account and finally decided to start trying some team games exactly 2 years ago, so that's why I'm making this post! (Also dunno if I still have cake, but if I do, I'm sharing so everyone take a slice) :D  This will mainly be Thank You's to the friends who I've had over the years, but I also wanted to say thank you the UHC community as a whole. You've really made my time here special, and some people may disagree, but I feel I've learnt a lot here that will help me IRL, so no, I don't feel like I've wasted my time here, or that this is simply a way to hide from reality. It's worth it for me:)  /u/DrWonkenstein - I believe you were one of my first proper friends on the subreddit. We teamed in that legendary Rto5 game that Lewis hosted, where we were the only 2 alive within about 20 minutes(on my channel as a highlights still!). I remember thinking that was one of the best games I've ever had, then being sad because I thought we wouldn't ever talk again. But we did! And many, many times from then on, and although we barely ever talk anymore, because you never play, thank you:) And I hope one day you'll play another to2 with me:P  /u/schmeon1 - Although we rarely talk anymore, you were a great friend back in our squeaker days, and I'll never forget our first game together, the mole game with Mr. Canadia and SkiIIBlade. You bully. Anyways, thanks for introducing me to your group of friends, cause that really helped me expand my friend-group in UHC! Also, thanks a bunch for helping me get into TTE along with frost, you have no idea how much that meant to me <3  /u/Maj0r_Min3r_98 - MajjorMinner:D I honestly can't remember how I met you(refresh my memory if you do?), but we've had some great games man. You're such a great guy to laugh with, and I'll never forget the good times we've had! We used to have tamales.. Although we don't team so much anymore, I hope over the summer we'll find a few games to play! Thanks maj:) P.S. Say Hi to henry for me;)  /u/Dark_rust - Dude, the amount of times we have teamed together is crazy:D I met you through Newtricy, after always thinking you must've been a dick, based simply on the reasoning that I never won a fight against you ever.. I was so wrong:P You're a great guy, and I'm happy that even though you don't play UHC as much, we still keep in contact through the odd game, and through our CTM map, which we will start getting some more progress on soon!!  /u/GlowingNeon - You, Wonk, Maj and I used to always hang out in teamspeak, whether it was on PvP servers, or in UHCs, we always had fun:D You're a really fun guy, and I still remember the days when I used to be able to actually put up a fight against you. Then you got your new computer.. :P Still remember the game where you hit me into the hole with lava and an enemy in it(it was my fault dw:P). It's all been fun, hope we can team again soon, and thanks:)  /u/Frostbreath - Hey frost! I remember the first game we teamed in was a mole games you hosted where we were teamed with mazzeltje(say hi to him for me if you still have contact with him?:P) and someone else. We got to being friends after that, which I thought was pretty cool, cause at the time I was a 12-year-old squeaker, and you were 'that cool older guy' ;) Thanks so much for helping me get into TTE, it means the world to me <3  /u/Antonin98 - We've teamed quite a lot and had some great games:) Wanted to quickly say thanks for always bein a fun teammate, and we've never really argued so I always turn to you if I'm looking for a game that I want to be sure I'll have a good time playing!  /u/hammer_fan - We only really started talking when I came back to the community, but we've teamed quite a few times in the short amount of time we've properly known eachother, and I felt like the way we teamed was as if we had known each other for much longer:) Also, thank you so frikkin much for referring me to Bonavento. Without you, I'd still be the only guy in the TTE/Newtricy ts, wondering where the fuck everyone had gone:P  /u/LolzandpolzUK - Lolz:D We've known each other for a long time, ever since schmeon introduced me to you. And it's been a great 2 years, with lots of fun games:) Thanks for alwayssss being fun to team with, you sarcastic guy;)  /u/XeR0x4 - You're never around anymore:( But we used to talk so much man:D I remember being on ttaylor's PvP server, just you and me, and we'd fight for hours when we were bored:P Seeing what the longest shot we could get was, etc. Hopefully, we'll find the time to team again:)  /u/MrCraftinator - Just wanted to say thank you, because you've done quite a lot for me, and even if you don't realise it, you've created so many friendships for me with other people, and I am so grateful for that:)  /u/veryniceryan - Ryan!:D We met through Frost, and I'm so glad we did, because you have been a great friend over the years. Although you don't play as much now, I'm happy that I've gotten you to play some more games with me. Hopefully you'll also keep sending me dank snapchats ofc;)  /u/swedishmineman - Heyo, we have recently started talking and you're a really cool guy, so fun to team with. We still don't team enough, so keep those team offers coming man. You're my badlion buddy;)  /u/Xmjdwow - ""Dood i need a whole paragrath where you say how much of a cool guy i am or its no upvote"" - this. omg such a kewl kid in ts like you dont even know, he is so funny and i think im in love or something.... <3<3<3  Other thank you's - evilmonkie, xfrostxfirex, sugar, adam, nofear, incipiens, goldcap, cybers, jakekub, kevinpirie, toot, caesar/miom, python, milen, stuff, timon, tomo, tvieh, holly, quake, momo(mimo2000) MG/Swyrnd.

The TS' I mainly visit have been entirely full of muted people. The exception being a few moments throughout the day where people weren't muted, but conversations were shortlived, or I couldn't take part because the discussion was secret. I expected such this morning, because today's a weekday, and in my experience, on the TS' I visit, people tend to not show up and have good conversations until like 3-4pm my time. Thing is, it's 5pm my time now, and they're still full of muted people. ;-;  Most of the 9 hours of this day so far was boredom. Sure, I caught a few videos I enjoyed, and I spent a little time on some art, but today was mostly boredom and a tad bit of frustration.   Alright, now here's something funny to lighten this up : boop"

Right now I'm just pushing to master, going to make a dev branch soon.  If you have any knowledge in Java, I'd love some critique - I have been working on this for 2 days now.  From a feature standpoint, the plugin is just missing a scatter, which I will be trying to implement soon. Probably going to do old-scatter-style - load chunks, then teleport people.  If you want to host with my plugin, I can send you a download, but I will restrict that to people I know can handle problems shall they arise."

Its a shame you don't enjoy hosting any more, you truly are a good host. You should try playing other peoples games with your friends and stuff, its always more fun like that. I'm not really sure of how I can convince you to stay.. Like I completely agree with the growth of hackers and disrespectful players. I did notice one thing though; US players are a lot more respectful than EU players. I have no idea how that works, or why its true, but it just is. Maybe you could like host US games idek. Just do what you need to do. Thanks for the past games you have hosted, and thanks for letting me spectate a majority of those I played."

The amount of hosts we have on Blizzard  /u/Gerbs283 said that they don't realize that it isn't all about fill and that it doesn't make you a good host. And i don't know, this may be the case for some hosts, but I made a whole post where i stated that i prefered smaller fills, because the games are more intense and you can provide a better experience for the players that you do have.

I don't like cutclean, I don't like fast paced PvP and I like to take time caving, but other people do like it and that's up to them.

ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,cheesymonkeey78,16,Sun Jun 28 18:18:07 2015 UTC,"that's such a stupid idea though  ""too lazy""  that's like saying you're too lazy walk to school when you want to drive instead.  if there's an easier, more enjoyable route, some people may take it. one has benefits and appeal, but so does the other."

Smelting takes up time, whether you do something while you're smelting or not. You usually take the time while smelting to grind gravel or mine obsidian or do something similar. You often won't go full YOLO and explore a cave, which you would usually do if you didn't have to smelt things. Removing smelting quickens the gameplay which some people like and some people don't, I just don't get why people can't accept that."

ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,nimmin13,3,Sun Jun 28 18:59:05 2015 UTC,"From the perspective of a host, cutclean is easier to host because you won't get the hate from not having cutclean enabled.

ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,BlazeThePolymath,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:18:30 2015 UTC,"No it's not vanilla when it's BestPvE.  You can't host Vanilla and BestPvE at the same time.  Vanilla and CutClean aren't overarching scenarios, it's either vanilla or it's not."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,Silver_Moonrox,2,Mon Jun 29 20:41:59 2015 UTC,It's fun to play so the host hosts what they think is fun is what i meant.
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,BlazeThePolymath,3,Sun Jun 28 21:27:31 2015 UTC,how is cutclean less fun than vanilla?
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,unclebenfranklin,2,Sun Jun 28 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"Well cutclean makes you stay in caves less of the time, which makes you less at risk for any PVE damage that might occur."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,Randall123459,-1,Sun Jun 28 19:18:10 2015 UTC,"Okay? Some people prefer pvp over caving. The majority of the community does, actually. Less caving does not equal less fun, especially when it's just cutclean. If you like caving and it's cutclean, then cave for longer; now you have extra time to cave rather than having to stop and smelt."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,Randall123459,3,Sun Jun 28 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"Woah there lassy, hold your horses. You asked what makes it less fun, so I told you my opinion."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,I_is_cheesecake,-2,Sun Jun 28 19:44:39 2015 UTC,"but your opinion doesn't make much sense  if you like caving, then cave. cutclean doesn't change that, you can still cave, even more than before because you don't have to stop to smelt. you can't blame cutclean for taking away the fun of caving, and that was my point"
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,Sean081799,3,Sun Jun 28 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't say anything about wanting to enjoy caving, I'm saying without needing to stay in caves as long you don't have to worry about taking PVE damage as much, because you can get armored quickly, and can either rush through caves without worrying about damage, or just get in and out."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,ThePurpOfDans,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:11:41 2015 UTC,that too
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,NEONpooP,2,Sun Jun 28 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"Because they always get filled, Usually from non-community members. Not to mention hosts always getting harassed about cutclean in non-cutclean games."

ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,Ratchet6859,2,Sun Jun 28 19:22:55 2015 UTC,"It makes it fast paced (which I don't enjoy, I like the relaxing feeling of caving), and a lot of people like PvP, so they get fills better."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,andrewbaseball99,2,Sun Jun 28 19:04:33 2015 UTC,"There's no way that people are going to have everyone on the same side of the argument. There's always going to be differing opinions. What I've noticed from this subreddit is that a lot of people don't accept other people's opinions and instead down vote them. I personally don't care if the game is cutclean or not, there's not that much of a difference."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,MusaTilly,2,Sun Jun 28 19:41:56 2015 UTC,"oh this again  i think for some it's just a general misunderstanding that more game-changing skripts make better hosts, and for others it's for convenience of playing.  Hosts like to host what they enjoy playing most the time."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,MarcoHanYT,2,Sun Jun 28 20:33:20 2015 UTC,I think I legitimately liked it when I first started hosting (my 1-100 games) also my friends influenced me on that.  It got repetitive after a while so I started hosting other scenarios.  Also I saw that the community didn't like cutclean so I tried to stay away from hosting it.  Currently I'm only hosting vanilla games and the rare best pve or depths.
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,WalshyZGame,2,Sun Jun 28 20:46:47 2015 UTC,Its easy to host and its more interesting then pure vanilla.
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,BrownageHD,2,Sun Jun 28 21:00:16 2015 UTC,Cutclean gets better fills than vanilla
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,KalikaTheCat,2,Sun Jun 28 22:20:20 2015 UTC,"More people enjoy playing CC, because it's less tedious than what UHC is. Really it's strategy more than PVP, but CC takes some of that thinking/time-management out, stuff that we might not enjoy, but is a core part of UHC.  But not many people see that. =/"
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,LordSuma,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:16:09 2015 UTC,But not many people see that   Understatement right there.
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,BrownageHD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:34:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just wanted to cover everyone who, well, you know."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,LordSuma,2,Tue Jun 30 00:27:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what everyone else has said: Fun and/or convenience. With CutClean, people can start go to PVP 10-20 minutes in(which many people enjoy over caving and find is the exciting part of UHC. Outside of funny clips, when have you seen anything similar to a ""PVElights,"" or how often do you see someone showing the damage they take from caves in a highlights?).    Let's be honest, most of the hosts and players here are used to the conveniences(Some people prefer them because they speed up gameplay, others dislike them for that reason. Time can be a factor as well since waiting 20-30 minutes for a game to end can be boring, whereas these types of games end rather quickly in my experience). Starter food, permaday, Cutclean are among those conveniences that some players come to expect every game. Heck, in one of TheSonicJoey's games, people wanted mob rates turned down because we're so used to large games where caves have few to no mobs, allowing us to explore quickly and get out quickly.   Hosting wise, we see a similar trend(not as prevalent, but it exists). There were enough hosts changing game rulse/modes to pander to players that a rule had to be specified forbidding it. Some have early meetups at the last few people remaining. Lastly, in addition to fill(maybe for team sizes or to help gain notoriety among the now PVP oriented community), hosts probably don't want to deal with the bullshit that others due for hosting nonCC games. Honestly speaking, if I was hosting, I wouldn't be in the mood for the nearly ubiquitous spam about how hard a game is without x,y, and z being handed over, so I can see where others would rather skip that part of the game.    All in all, like everyone's been saying, hosting a cc game all but guarantees a fill(somewhere between the foundation of the reddit and the present day, a large fill was considered better than a small fill because reasons I will never understand.), significantly reduces game time(allowing for hosting more games), and will decrease some of the spam and complaints."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,I_is_cheesecake,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:32:37 2015 UTC,The complaints shouldn't give you a reason to give into hosting cutclean because they want you to.
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,MathXv,2,Mon Jun 29 13:50:27 2015 UTC,I will never ever ever ever host cutclean ever.
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,Cross_FireHD,2,Mon Jun 29 00:23:37 2015 UTC,I've been going through the Applications for Eureka and one of the questions were What gamemodes would you host multiple people put Cutclean if people want it and it gets a fill or something a long them lines.
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,bitlington,2,Mon Jun 29 01:04:39 2015 UTC,"Because 90% of my friends enjoy them, including me."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,CubedHeart,5,Mon Jun 29 02:14:44 2015 UTC,"In my honest opinion, cutclean should only be hosted during rush/barebones since they are shorter. Other than that, it's really not that hard to make a furnace and cook your stuff. As cheesy and lewis said, there are many other things you could be doing while you are waiting for your stuff to cook."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,andrewbaseball99,3,Sun Jun 28 18:56:42 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I think.
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,CubedHeart,2,Sun Jun 28 19:17:53 2015 UTC,"Because alot of hosts get impatient and bored (hence hosts doing early meetups often) and it gives them an excuse to host short games, e.g 60 min games. At least that's what I think."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,Shortgamer,5,Sun Jun 28 18:19:23 2015 UTC,If someone wanted to host a short game wouldn't they just host rush rather than a 60 minute game O.o
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,milen323,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:55:22 2015 UTC,"not sure but i presume alot of hosts dont like rush's, and this is why there arent too many being hosted"
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,Silver_Moonrox,2,Mon Jun 29 13:59:01 2015 UTC,"They may realise that more people will join their game if it's cutclean, so will host for a better fill (but not necessarily better players)  Plus they may just personally like it."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,DerpyDoseGamez,2,Sun Jun 28 18:31:21 2015 UTC,"Probably because demand is big, unfortunately. With the demand for cutclean games being so big, hosts tend to host it more, rather than other scenarios, which take out all the diversity. Once the demand for it decreases, new scenarios will arise with big demand, and probably there will be less games with cutclean."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,MusaTilly,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:32:20 2015 UTC,Well the thing is cutclean can go with about any scenario so I don't think its going away.
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,JonnyJersey,2,Sun Jun 28 19:43:30 2015 UTC,"From talking to hosts, they do it because players request for cutclean, and it gives a fill. Some say because they want to host but they don't have 90 - 60 minutes to host a game."
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,supremeshieldon,2,Sun Jun 28 18:36:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly the reason why I host cutclean mostly is that i feel a lot of players get tired of doing the same routine (creating furnaces and smelting their ores). But now I am starting to see the pluses in vanilla (less pvp earlier, not full iron immediately (causing some armor/leather fights), and less snowballing imo). So now I'm starting to host more vanilla games.   Cutclean is really on for lazy people who don't like to make furnaces and smelt their ores/food  edit: grammar and such (bc I'm on phone)"
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,Tarqeted,2,Sun Jun 28 18:40:33 2015 UTC,players get tired of doing the same routine (creating furnaces and smelting their ores).    You could say that about UHC in general.
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,HTharaldTH,0,Sun Jun 28 20:50:29 2015 UTC,Yep that's why now I play a lot of barebones games
ultrahardcore,3bf8q0,MeowNawn,2,Sun Jun 28 23:13:40 2015 UTC,Because they enjoy it and it fills.  What's the big deal about cut clean anyways. It barely changes the game. It doesn't force you to go early hunting.  It doesn't force you to cave longer.

ultrahardcore,3bc5z2,JackerzzUHC,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:28:51 2015 UTC,I don't think it disallows you from doing it. I'm pretty sure it is 1.8 shows you incorrect exp cost in a 1.7 server

ultrahardcore,3bc5z2,xEP1CxUN1CORNx,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:56:40 2015 UTC,"that's correct, but it disallows you from doing it at least in my experience because it'll take your levels but not combine the items and instead just drop them on the ground"
ultrahardcore,3bc5z2,Gerbs283,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:07:09 2015 UTC,no the levels being taken is a visual glitch  if you enchant something for like 1 level it fixes back to the original number minus 1

And I can't keep outputting money to try to fix it, if nothing is getting fixed. (Final decision will take place on Wednesday)  I've had staff offer to take over for me when I can't be available, but that is for a majority of the game, and I wouldn't want to have to rely 80% on other people to do the job that I'm supposed to do.   It does really suck to have to say all this:/ Because I've been getting a lot of messages of how excited people are to play, and trust me I plan to make up for this 100% in the future, but for now, I'm going to have to say that the likeliness of this game happening, solely relies on whether my internet booster will work or not. And if this doesn't work, then rip my hosting career:(  Also, thanks for the one year in this community! I wouldn't have wanted to spend it any other way.

He would always put a smile on my face because I knew I had a friend who cared.  xZyleon A person I am no longer friends with. But he invited me to my first UHC group. We would play many UHCs and have a great time. We played a small SMP together. He helped me improve on hosting. He was my pal..
