I had an OK cupid account, and in my bio I wrote about dog grooming/breeding and the conservation of endangered species, two things I care deeply about. So he messages me:  ""Tell me about how you would groom a panda.""  He's cute enough, so I do. I tell him about their habitat, their thick coats, their behavioral tendencies in capitivity, animal husbandry, etc.  He's dumbfounded and we make little banter after that.  Fast forward three weeks... I'm sitting in English class, and I see him on Scruff, but I didn't put two and two together, I hardly remember talking to him on OkCupid. We talked for days straight.  So we agreed to coffee. I looked like a disheveled mess with all my books and notebooks for school. He thought it was weird that I called him versus texting him about a change of coffee shop.  It was an awkward first date, I was head over heels for him, he was mildly interested but needed me to wow him.  We were saying our goodbyes, he said he was sure we'd just be friends until he saw me lean on my car, like in the movies. One leg on my car, one on the ground, confident.   He asked me for a kiss right then and there."

gaybrosgonemild,3cp9t9,WJ90,2,Thu Jul 9 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that it takes up to 30 mins for the effect to kick in and right after intake, there may be a short 'down' (you can actually use it before sleep). More than 3 coffees per day are bad for you according to many doctors. I tried many different kinds how the coffee was brewed but filtered works best for me. Never use cheap beans/powder. The really good ones can used for both coffee and espresso.  Plus, coffee is a diuretic. Drink something else along or in between. Like water."
gaybrosgonemild,3cp9t9,WJ90,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:09:45 2015 UTC,I used to drink too much coffee. Like a pot or 2 a day. But it was cheap stuff usually unless I wanted to go to the starbucks store and try their exotic brands. But now I only drink it in like dire situations. I try to stay away from stimulants cuz the crash I have after is usually worse than the tiredness I had before!

It just happened randomly, I was studying minding my own business when out of nowhere it felt like someone hit me in the tricep with a bat. From Sunday to Tuesday I lost all use of my arm up to my wrist then on Wednesday when I woke up, my hand didn't work. So after countless doctors appointments and tests I finally got an appointment with Dr. Susan Mackinnon at GWU in St. Louis. She suggested that I have a surgery to fix the issue. Last week I had surgery to release an impingement on my radial nerve. It was 28 mm in diameter as opposed to the normal 5 mm. Then this week, I had a nerve transfer on my forearm and a tendon transfer on my hand. The good news is that I can wiggle my fingers today."
gaybrosgonemild,3bi7hz,thederekharper,3,Mon Jun 29 19:01:10 2015 UTC,"I'll be praying for your recovery man friend, best of luck and im glad to hear you're able to wiggle your fingers."

Take a hot shower to help loser it up and then use conditioner, gently rub it into the hair (the paint will pull your hair while you do it) let it sit in for a couple minutes then start to rinse it out and combing your hair with your fingers. Then apply more conditioner/shampoo and use a fine tooth comb!"

So I posted this long thing about equality and being gay and how it's a movement for treating people with respect and stuff and how is more than just a gay issue it's showing that racial equality is an issue we should focus on. I got text messages from people I haven't heard from in YEARS. Like best friend from middle school when I first started feeling for guys, the girl I went to homecoming with, my friend who I have gone to like 30 concerts with. They all said that they are proud and that they wish I was still around cuz they want people in their lives who aren't afraid to be themselves and he true to who they are. Usually I'm not emotional but I thought all these people would push me away but it just brought them closer and I'm so happy I have people who care. I ass crying all day and emotional eating (I didn't feel like working out) and kinda just reflection on what happened. WE WILL BE READING ABOUT THIS DAY IN HISTORY BOOKS GUYS!!!

gaybrosgonemild,3b4sg4,mab1981,3,Thu Jun 25 23:38:51 2015 UTC,Awesome! Interesting research. you should tell us what your research found!
gaybrosgonemild,3b4sg4,jonathanyoungiii,2,Fri Jun 26 00:34:01 2015 UTC,"Gladly!  The long and short of it is that recent physical activity was more predictive of more positive mental health outcomes in adolescents, rather than early childhood physical activity.  The key message coming out of this particular piece of research is that it doesn't matter if you haven't been physically active a day in your life, if you start today, you'll have better mental health outcomes than if you never start at all.  Seems a bit intuitive, but this is one of the first long-term longitudinal pieces of research that has played this out.  Those who remained consistently physically active over early childhood up to adolescence and those who started out physically inactive and became active were more likely to have better mental health outcome, compared to those who were consistently physically inactive, despite controlling for a whole whack of individual and socio-demographic factors."
gaybrosgonemild,3b4sg4,heymeepo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:55:25 2015 UTC,What sort of interpretations did you propose for your findings? :)
gaybrosgonemild,3b4sg4,txag2014-1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:08:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I make an argument for causality, which is a bit bold, I suppose, suggesting that proximal physical activity may prevent adverse mental health outcomes in adolescents.  That's probably my biggest things.  I don't posit a specific pathway (outside of the scope of my research) but do list off a bunch of things that may be at play both physiological, psychosocial and sociodemographic, but yeah.  Happy to fire off a PDF when I've had a chance to defend."

gaybrosgonemild,3b1asb,loving_embrace,14,Thu Jun 25 04:07:29 2015 UTC,"Don't worry bro.  You are plenty attractive, like forreal.  Places like Grindr and such are the worst thing ever for any kind of confidence building.  Don't go by those.  If you don't fit a cookie cutter mold it's hard to get any kind of attention.  Best thing to do is just say 'fork it, I'm me, and I am going to be me', and love yourself."
gaybrosgonemild,3b1asb,edendream,5,Thu Jun 25 05:14:41 2015 UTC,"You're cute. Serious looking but cute. Cuteness only goes so far. If dating apps are your focus then make sure there is something of substance in your profile. Something I can latch on to after I see how cute you are. Don't say ""Sup"" and don't continually ask ""What's up?"" real conversation goes a long way."
gaybrosgonemild,3b1asb,jdgenntry,3,Thu Jun 25 14:07:38 2015 UTC,"Haven't gotten any messages or replies on Grindr, OkCupid, etc. in a long time. The silence of all those guys makes me feel really shitty.  It's gotten to the point where I just don't want to live in this city anymore. If I hope to develop a relationship with someone, it won't happen here, apparently. I'm just worried that my attractiveness is the real problem, and that I'll experience the same disinterest wherever I go."
gaybrosgonemild,3b1asb,SteelyEyedGuy,8,Thu Jun 25 04:14:14 2015 UTC,"The thing that you should understand is that a lot of dating/ hookup apps can be frustrating if you don't fit a rather narrow type. This doesn't even always equate to attractiveness, either, but to whatever's trendy. Race, height, build, background, etc: there are loads of factors that boil down to how fickle people are rather than how attractive you are yourself. To be popular on those places usually means that you not only have to be attractive, but the right kind of attractive (white-ish, young-ish, and square-jawed). Hell, just ask most people to really let loose and explain their ideal 'type' and they'll write you a damn novel. There's no pleasing everyone.  So no, I don't think that you're unattractive in the least, but using those sites as your yardstick for self analysis is going to lead you wrong more often than not. I wish that I had some easy answer, but it's part of the minefield of dating that everyone has to trek and you're far from alone in that."
gaybrosgonemild,3b1asb,thederekharper,2,Thu Jun 25 09:32:52 2015 UTC,Not sure where you've got that low confidence level but honestly you're not unattractive. You've got looks like /u/jofnj mentioned.
gaybrosgonemild,3b1asb,deadpanxfitter,2,Thu Jun 25 05:50:45 2015 UTC,"You are very attractive with beautiful eyes. I dropped Grindr and OKCupid a while back myself. I want that relationship too and those places weren't the place for it. But yes, you're very attractive!"
gaybrosgonemild,3b1asb,roferg69,3,Thu Jun 25 16:31:15 2015 UTC,"The subject of the photo is attractive; the quality of the photo is utter shit.  The lighting is terrible, the photo is all grainy, it's shot square-on like a mugshot, and you've got a neutral/grumpy expression on your face.  Download a self-timer app for your phone's camera that has a ""burst mode"" that will take multiple pics.  Set it up in a room with ample natural sunlight, and then play with it!  Have some fun making happy/smiling/laughing expressions, and pretend you're having a genuinely fantastic time to make the expressions authentic.  Shoot a ton of pics, and then sort through them to pick out a few good ones.  Crop, edit, and filter as necessary.  The problem here isn't what you're offering up...the problem is how you're offering it up."
gaybrosgonemild,3b1asb,skylerhimself,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:15:38 2015 UTC,Ok my friend I'm not gay but I know what the problem is here. ITS YOUR CONFIDENCE BRO. You look like a normal guy to me and I don't know why it could be. But I'm not sure about men but I know if you don't grow some confidence regardless if you get someone to message you back it will end shortly if you can't show your man you know your the shit.

gaybrosgonemild,3asxpo,Teutophilia,2,Tue Jun 23 06:41:49 2015 UTC,You're perfect already. Confidence is more attractive than any amount of physical beauty.

gaybrosgonemild,3aqxxe,FlexibualSexual,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:01:53 2015 UTC,I saw it at first glance but after a while it wears off
gaybrosgonemild,3aqxxe,sincitybro,5,Tue Jun 23 05:45:39 2015 UTC,Dude...sexy scientist.
gaybrosgonemild,3aqxxe,alan713ch,2,Mon Jun 22 21:53:03 2015 UTC,Lab coats up the attraction level of anyone. It's a scientific fact.

gaybrosgonemild,3aqxxe,flamsterrific,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:48:06 2015 UTC,Lots of time to take them when you're waiting for an assay to run :)
gaybrosgonemild,3aqxxe,flamsterrific,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:00:41 2015 UTC,"True. The equipment I use needs to be wiped dry every time and then preparing the next sample starts right after. Heh anyway, nice pic. :)"

gaybrosgonemild,3aqxxe,c4ldy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:28:33 2015 UTC,Doesn't help that my samples are sticky. That's enough incentive to always wear gloves.

gaybrosgonemild,3am4lt,DanielKennedyDesigns,3,Sun Jun 21 16:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, real looks like it. You went from smiling and happy to looking like you're dead inside.  I'd take before any day, thanks."
gaybrosgonemild,3am4lt,Astaxanthin,0,Sun Jun 21 21:52:42 2015 UTC,"If you think just because someone is smiling they are happy, and because they are posing they are dead inside.   You are deluded."
gaybrosgonemild,3am4lt,Astroman129,-1,Mon Jun 22 09:39:34 2015 UTC,"No, not at all. I'm a person who thinks that when someone is taking a photo they should be showing a side of themselves that's attractive. You? Not even remotely close. I battle suicide everyday and I want to die constantly, I know that smiles can be fake. But a fake smile is better than no smile.   In your photo you look remarkably unattractive. The idiotic filter you've put over it makes you look depressed as shit, you refuse to look at the camera instead staring out at something on the horizon. You have zero emotion expressed, yet you claim to be 'happy'. It's hard to believe when you show zero inkling of it. Maybe if you had actually tried smiling you wouldn't have gotten so massively downvoted, and so many people wouldn't agree with me."

Then once the ink dries on your ""You're hired!"" paperwork, let yourself go back to normal."

All combined has meant I have never had confidence in myself... Like if nobody else likes me how can I like myself... Anyway, I have it better than a lot of people so forget my sob story and don't feel sorry for me... Also --> you snooped for /r/GayBrosGoneWild ???

You just need to take babysteps in terms of trusting folk and coming out of your shell to them. There's no easy fix. Just slowly, slowly. Probably not what you want to hear, sorry! Took me ages to find my confidence. Still don't have that much, to be honest, but I'm getting there. And some nice comments on here helped me, so hopefully they'll help you too.

gaybrosgonemild,38hmyu,redditsucksdiscs,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:12:03 2015 UTC,"I plan to. One of the best parts of the trip was the people. Met many amazing ladies and gents while I was there. The punks I met in Belfast were a blast to hang out with for the night. Though, when they realized I was gay they wrapped up the night pretty quickly. That was a bit of a downer."

gaybrosgonemild,38hmyu,candyperfumeboy83,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:50:34 2015 UTC,"My life is as boring as it could get... Ireland is okay, I guess, there's worse places to live... We get rain, a week of sun per year, but never any truly extreme weather, never major natural disasters so we're safe from hurricanes and earthquakes... We're a neutral country so we ain't got beef with anyone that can invade us, so safe in that sense. There's a lot of greenery outside of Dublin, and bad accents that I can't understand, inside Dublin there's a north and south side separated by a river infested with shopping trolleys and decomposed people. I think it would be a pretty average place to live, kinda expensive, but could be worse, could be a lot better."

I was reading some of your submitted (again, because I'm bored and you strike me like an interesting lad) and i saw that you like bikes, is that right? I've always wanted to travel in a deserted route with one. I never had the chance to buy one tho."
gaybrosgonemild,38atvz,Bedsheats,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:30:14 2015 UTC,"Not too much to rant about.   Just working too many 13-14 hour days and it's kept me out of the gym.  So I'm more on edge than usual.    Yea, I own an old honda atm, and am about to buy my 2nd bike this Summer.  I've been riding for a year.   Best decision I ever made.  Its so freeing, man."

I remember a time when I worked at the docks (yeah), I used to work 12 hours shifts from 7pm to 7am. Needless to say I was pretty much a hermit.  About the gym, I have the context-build similar like yours (I think, i don't know if you're tall or your age), I have a wide back (12 years swimming when i was young helped a lot) but I'm a fuzzy bear with an unequivocal belly beer. The thing is i can't seem to have the will power to hit the gym, at the last minute lazyness takes over me. Is there any way I can trick myself into exercise? Have you ever quit and manage to get back on the run?"
gaybrosgonemild,38atvz,Bedsheats,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:50:56 2015 UTC,"I work out when I can, but im naturally strong, so I don't worry too much.  This job keeps me in decent shape with all the unloading I do, but I want to hit a gym daily.  The 530 am to 530pm sucks cuz it's either get up and hit planet fitness super early or fight rush hour to the gym."
gaybrosgonemild,38atvz,omahamateo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:32:13 2015 UTC,"Right, there's no way i can get up that early to exercise. Having some physical effort may have it's benefits. I now have a desk job and i sat 7 hours straight, kinda sucks."

gaybrosgonemild,37wem8,indominusraptor,1 point,Sun May 31 05:34:54 2015 UTC,"Are you in a bigger city with a lot of younger guys? It's all in the eyes man, if a guy looks you up and down really quickly he is gay and checking you out. And trust me, almost every guy is going to be checking you out. You would be shocked how many gay guys are right in front of you without realizing it.=)  It's more genuine to meet guys like this in my opinion. Meeting guys on Grindr or at a gay club isn't going to get you anything other than sex. Although if that's what you're looking for you could get it within 15 minutes if you wanted."
gaybrosgonemild,37wem8,indominusraptor,4,Sun May 31 05:39:58 2015 UTC,You are beautiful

You can do this and don't forget that you need to love yourself for who you are. You matter."

gaybrosgonemild,36xxu3,Beautifly1,3,Sat May 23 06:24:45 2015 UTC,"Well that's it then. You just need to pop your dating cherry. I have an idea. You could date me, and that would solve everything!"

gaybrosgonemild,36zvcs,AdenJames,1 point,Sat May 23 19:36:55 2015 UTC,"Ooo good luck with blight. Kale, peppers, lettuce probably later on, a selection of herbs, maybe some tomatoes, spinach, and onions depending on how motivated I continue to feel"
gaybrosgonemild,36yjn6,PaperweightRoom,2,Sat May 23 05:03:08 2015 UTC,"You are so fucking hot, it hurts.  Where is that?"

gaybrosgonemild,36yjn6,GetFished,2,Sat May 23 06:53:26 2015 UTC,"It really does... but I can confidently say, from personal experience, that the lack of humidity is priceless."

gaybrosgonemild,36xba9,Hogsguy,10,Fri May 22 21:59:49 2015 UTC,I think your hair would look sexy pushed back
gaybrosgonemild,36xba9,candidd,6,Fri May 22 22:05:58 2015 UTC,Agreed.
gaybrosgonemild,36xba9,AyySL,6,Fri May 22 22:21:56 2015 UTC,You could probably do anything with it and it would still look good.
gaybrosgonemild,36xba9,AdenJames,3,Fri May 22 23:23:12 2015 UTC,I like your hair as is!  Just needs a trim.
gaybrosgonemild,36xba9,footnotefour,3,Sat May 23 03:00:50 2015 UTC,"You have a great face shape OP!  I know this is a bit ""overdone"", but short on the sides (I'd say a 2-3 on the buzzer) and slightly trim the top. Use a matte hair wax to do something with it and you'd look super sexy (not that you already don't, because damn)."
gaybrosgonemild,36xba9,Xop,3,Sat May 23 02:52:14 2015 UTC,I think a buzz all the way around would be cool.
gaybrosgonemild,36xba9,captainstardriver,1 point,Sat May 23 05:47:05 2015 UTC,I would say much shorter. You have really nice features and I think the darkness of your hair could distract them from a bit. Less is more. You could try something where the sides are buzzed and the top is short but still there; but maybe that's risky.
gaybrosgonemild,36xba9,windkirby,1 point,Sat May 23 12:01:42 2015 UTC,You're perfect

I'm in my second year of 5, here in the UK the whole lot is combined and you start uni studying medicine straight out of school and leave 5 years later as a doctor (although you have to do more training while on the job to be properly registered)"
gaybrosgonemild,36mdsz,FlexibualSexual,2,Wed May 20 17:04:30 2015 UTC,"I'm UK too :) I'm a grad medic though as I did a chemistry degree first, so I'm 2nd year out of 4 and 5th year out of 7 overall. I can only faintly remember life before university to be honest, the real world scares me now."
gaybrosgonemild,36mdsz,FlexibualSexual,2,Wed May 20 17:38:37 2015 UTC,"I'm kind if grad... I did 2 years of engineering, but then quit. Total of 4 'gap' years between school and medicine! Where are you studying? I'm in Manchester."

Worked for an engineering firm in the first one, straight out of school, and then worked as a healthcare assistant for a year to get experience and apply to medical school. Ah.. Southampton. I'm from Salisbury, so been down a fair bit. Have certain vague memories of a place called Jesters..."

gaybrosgonemild,36mdsz,monsieurezra,2,Wed May 20 17:49:05 2015 UTC,I totally thought about this during your description.

I've bombed my fair share of finals. I made a 5 on a calculus 2 final, once. Five percent. The problem I got points on, I was supposed to draw a curve. I'm pretty sure my TA was like, ""ef it, that is a curve. Not the right curve, but close enough. You get some points.""    I think my final grade in that course was 18. Which was curved to a D, because the professor sucked. And D is for Done.    But anyway. Good luck on the final! I'm sure you'll do better than a 5."

gaybrosgonemild,35ihrd,gamerdude2323,8,Sun May 10 21:18:10 2015 UTC,"Haha, we may have had a wardrobe change. We really wanted to have at least a few pictures of us wearing our Batman and Superman shirts, but wanted the majority of our pictures to be a little more formal. Since it was a public place, we couldn't wear our matching superhero briefs. :("

From time to time, people on Grindr et al. will send an insulting message about his ears.  He shows me these for a laugh.

gaybrosgonemild,35aoek,thelowcrows,9,Fri May 8 15:04:06 2015 UTC,"Copying from the comments on that post:   I lost most of my weight through diet alone. I counted every calorie and avoided empty carbs as much as possible while upping my protein intake. It was simple really. Meal prep is my best friend. I'm one of those, ""feeling lazy=fast food"" eaters. Having a ready to eat meal for every day is the best. Cut out soda. Drink water. Watch your snacking. Protein shakes helped curb my hunger a lot. And now I lift every weekday. I focus on two muscle groups every day and on Friday try to get some cardio in. I'm trying to get a little more bulky now so I'm eating a lot more with my lifting.  As far as mentally, once I started seeing results it was really easy. I keep an album of guys I think are hot on my phone and look at it before heading to the gym or when I'm wanting to eat dirty. :)"

gaybrosgonemild,35aoek,iamaprettypinkdonut,2,Fri May 8 16:47:37 2015 UTC,The wrong mask can really dry out your skin or make it look dull...so be careful.  Not irreparable damage of course but make sure to do your research and to talk to a cosmetologist.
gaybrosgonemild,35aoek,randomla87,2,Fri May 8 21:05:05 2015 UTC,I did! My friend and I are crazy about skincare. Thank you!

You also suggest that everyone ""get big"".  I congratulate you on your success. It's obvious you had a goal and worked very hard to achieve your goal. You have my respect for that.  The whole premise you are espousing here is what I hate most about the gay community in general however. No, we do not all want a jacked, ripped, and stacked Abercrombie model. To me, you went from a super attractive guy to something I would never glance twice at if I saw you in a room. I'm not trying to criticize you specifically, I did the exact same thing you did with going from thin to muscular. The point I'm trying to make is that there is nothing wrong with being thin.  In fact, some of us really, really appreciate skinny guys. Had you just posted about your achievement I wouldn't be typing this, I would have just upvoted you for your work and moved on. I feel the need to type this out however because of the attitude this post is putting forward - that you're only attractive if you're ""big"". Which is ironically hypocritical given your Abercrombie statement.  I see so many guys on here that feel genuinely terrible about not being a gym bunny. They shouldn't feel that way and no, they don't have to ""get big"" for someone to like them.  I'm glad this helped you feel good about yourself, but it's not a requirement for everyone."
gaybrosgonemild,34zx43,truthful_ibex,1 point,Wed May 6 13:07:08 2015 UTC,"No you took the exact wrong thing from my post. If you gleaned that ""you're only attractive if you're big"" then you got it wrong. The whole point was I'm not jacked, ripped, or shredded like abercrombie models. I'm a powerlifter and just big.   I was trying to convey the message to be yourself and everyone is beautiful. I've had guys tell me they don't want to lift because they'll lose their six pack... So my message was to not be afraid to get big if that's what you want to do.   Thanks for taking the wrong message though, for putting down what I considered to be a big achievement for me, and for generally insulting me overall. None of your response was needed, but instead you went out of your way to make sure I knew that you think I'm a hypocrite.  I'd say you've a touch of hypocrisy in you as well, because you just put me down for being myself."

Coming from someone who has been in both your position and your exs, if he got home after 4 months and went to see his friends first, whatever he had going on in his head about your relationship he'd already made his mind up.   You need to prevent shit like that happening again and to do that you need to communicate better. I know hard it is to take someone's word for it when you're suspicious about crap but if you've a gut feeling about something it's normally because you can't trust them or they're giving you a reason not to."
gaybrosgonemild,34y1ni,BlubberyGiraffe,1 point,Tue May 5 20:45:01 2015 UTC,"yeah he totally made up his mind on the drive.  It was a combination of him being away and doing some things that frustrated me, so i think i subconciously was negative to guilt trip him maybe? idk. all i know is that i was too negative too often and he fell out of love with me for it.    i do wish we talked about it while he was spending all this time thinking about it.  I think reuniting would fix many of the issues, but he was deadset so ive grieved but moved on"

gaybrosgonemild,345um6,firentxxx,2,Wed Apr 29 01:26:59 2015 UTC,"I looked through your history a bit. So you got that big lifting for just a year or two? How did you start out, and what program was most effective?"
gaybrosgonemild,345um6,firentxxx,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:20:08 2015 UTC,"Over a year, yes. Granted I've been pretty physically active at various stages of my life but I had never previously gained much muscle. I think though that primed me for acquiring mass.   I consulted with a lot of friends and I am lucky to have that network. My best friend is a retired MMA fighter and he gave me some great advice which is essentially to pick a program and stick with it. Lots of people sort of fuck around with this or that, and fuck around with their diet, and then they're surprised when they get fuck around results. But if you're disciplined then it will pay off.   I chose to follow Strong Lifts 5x5 as it is geared towards a beginner lifter, it's incredibly simple, and focuses on big compound movements. There's even an app. I did that for 8 months before switching to Wendler 531.  In terms of diet I went from a vegetarian for 9 years to eating meat and drastically upped my calorie intake. I didn't care what I ate before. For lifting, at least for the first six months or so, I probably obsessively tracked my calories just to get used to what a certain amount of food looks like. I consumed about 3500 calories a day. I shot for at least a gram of protein per pound of body weight, more if I could, so I usually got around 200g easily. I didn't care about carbs or fat, they were just along for the ride. I went from 175 to about 200 lbs in maybe four months which is the weight I wanted but not the body composition so that's when I reduced my calories and started changing my macro ratios. Keeping protein high but fewer carbs, also I tried to stick to about 2300 calories a day.   That's maybe more than you wanted but it's what worked for me. Eat a lot, lift heavy things, get a full nights sleep. Of course I'd be happy to answer any other questions too."
gaybrosgonemild,345um6,firentxxx,1 point,Wed Apr 29 10:10:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, that's a lot of good information. I did starting strength for 4 months last year and gained 15 pounds to get to 165 at 6'1. I'm starting up again now that I'm done with my undergrad and will have more free time. But yeah counting calories is definitely important for me as if I don't I could eat as little as 1800 calories on a day and feel fine."
gaybrosgonemild,345um6,psykobomb,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:28:40 2015 UTC,"I hesitate to say that diet is everything but diet is hugely important. Your body is a machine and if you don't fuel the machine, or don't fuel it with the right things, how can you expect high performance?   A quick way to get a ton of calories is protein shakes. Two cups of milk, two scoops of your favorite protein, some peanut butter, bananas, maybe a few berries and some greens. You can easily break 1000 calories with one of those bad boys."

gaybrosgonemild,34158x,Drezus,2,Mon Apr 27 20:26:05 2015 UTC,Disagree. It's harder to see you beauty without some sort of light. But I concur that a lack of a light source would suggest a different approach. ;)
gaybrosgonemild,34158x,blazeroy,2,Mon Apr 27 15:40:48 2015 UTC,... And you look more mysterious ...

The last four workouts help build and strengthen for the compound workouts (squats, deads).  For upper body, benchpress, abs(sit-ups), shoulder press, rows, tricep extensions, bicep curls, and cable cross. Some days I split my back between legs or upper body. But usually legs.

gaybrosgonemild,338wa3,itsinmyface,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:17:52 2015 UTC,What's the best way to do this? I've literally never had facial hair longer than a couple of days before.

gaybrosgonemild,338wa3,hjwj,2,Tue Apr 21 02:58:03 2015 UTC,Get a trimmer that has different length settings.
gaybrosgonemild,338wa3,itsinmyface,1 point,Tue Apr 21 05:21:28 2015 UTC,"I usually just have my barber do it honestly, lol. They'll fix it up for me. but as was mentioned below, get a trimmer if you want to do it yourself. you might also want a razor to line up some parts, like the edges and whatnot."
gaybrosgonemild,338wa3,gonline,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:00:34 2015 UTC,"I like that length, but I think you could go either way. Cleaner definitely would look great. I would say let it grow if you're curious. You don't know if it will look good, so I can't say [as a stranger]. Only way is letting it grow and seeing then. If it doesn't, shave. If it doesn't, keep it and you learned something. Nice pic btw!"
