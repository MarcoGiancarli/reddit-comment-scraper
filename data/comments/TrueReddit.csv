Lack of access to preventative health care due to money/time/logistical/educational factors. More mothers with lifestyle diseases such as obesity, diabetes or heart disease. Lack of access to healthcare, nutrition, exercise, etc. needed to manage these lifestyle diseases due to money/time/logistical/educational factors. Over-reliance on c-sections, although several other countries have higher c-section rates. Higher maternal age.

TrueReddit,3e2qjv,dontpet,2,Tue Jul 21 18:44:46 2015 UTC,"That isn't how this study was performed, it didn't rely on any one country's measurement of maternal mortality:   We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to analyse a database of data for 7065 site-years and estimate the number of maternal deaths from all causes in 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. We estimated the number of pregnancy-related deaths caused by HIV on the basis of a systematic review of the relative risk of dying during pregnancy for HIV-positive women compared with HIV-negative women. We also estimated the fraction of these deaths aggravated by pregnancy on the basis of a systematic review. To estimate the numbers of maternal deaths due to nine different causes, we identified 61 sources from a systematic review and 943 site-years of vital registration data. We also did a systematic review of reports about the timing of maternal death, identifying 142 sources to use in our analysis. We developed estimates for each country for 1990-2013 using Bayesian meta-regression. We estimated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all values.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797575"

While some of the rise in maternal mortality is coming from poor mothers who lack reliable access to both prenatal care and general health care, most of the risk factors for maternal death affect middle-class women as well.  Even middle-class women can have insufficient health insurance, a sedentary lifestyle, a poor diet, and high levels of stress.  Basically, we're seeing older, unhealthier women who are having more c-sections - all major risk factors for blood clots and embolisms, which are the fastest-growing causes of maternal death."

TrueReddit,3e1vl9,Pm_Me_You_Life_Story,8,Tue Jul 21 13:13:36 2015 UTC,"The number one rule I use is always be skeptical so you are doing the absolute right thing but trying to get full information. I will give you my experience which I can not guarantee for everyone.  Basically your credit score is made up on 5 things as you may or may not know. These are:  Payment history (35%) Amounts owed (30%) Length of credit history (15%) Types of credit in use (10%) New credit (10%)  The big thing with new credit cards is that it places a hard inquiry on your credit report. Too many of these and banks may think you are desperate for new credit and there is a small chance they will turn down new applications. I have heard of people with a dozen hard inquiries a year and never been turned down. As it relates to your credit score it is the smallest percentage and my score goes down by about 2 points with each new card. HOWEVER!  My utilization ration goes down because I never carry a balance and now have 3k for example in new credit. Also my payment history is improved.  One more negative is that it lowers the average age of accounts. Rule number one is never cancel your oldest cards because they look at length of your credit history and if you cancel the old ones that goes way down.  In my experience people of churn are very fiscally responsible because they must keep track of spending and always pay cards off. It makes zero sense to get a free flight when you are paying 22% interest on a card. The CC companies give out these bonuses with hopes that peeps will pay interest so don't be that person.  subscribe to r/churning as well. Over there is the holy grail of frequent flyer miles travel. In the next 2 months I'm going to the Caribbean and that cost me $30 and then Oregon and that cost me $11. tl, dr: My credit score goes down with every new hard inquiry but then goes up because of longer ontime payment history and lower credit utilization.

Of course we have different expectations of bankers and bank robbers (and therefore, you can argue that the bankers' action was worse), but it seems to me that stealing depositors' money is either ok or wrong, no matter who does it.

If your private information is made particularly visible, that is a greater violation than if your privacy is made visible along with millions of others. The fact that millions of other people are in the same situation as you mitigates the result of the privacy violation.  Privacy violations are most significant when an individual is singled out.

So... I guess I think they're culpable! Does that mean they deserve to go out of business? See below:  I'm of the opinion that we need higher security standards across the board. Based on this catastrophe and several others, I think unencrypted user account information should not generally be available even to a cleared insider. Highly sensitive information should be uniformly restricted, perhaps only available when several independent actors request them, akin to how nuclear missile controls work. Since I'm not an IT or security expert, I'm not sure how this can be implemented (even the NSA appears to have been unable to stop a dedicated insider from walking out with the house silver), but more and more I'm convinced that no company, no matter how dedicated, can be trusted with some information. I'll be looking closely to see how AM got compromised, but to the extent that they were making security/confidentiality promises that they couldn't keep, they absolutely SHOULD go out of business, and every other internet site should be watching, and on notice."
TrueReddit,3e03qw,Momojo,4,Tue Jul 21 03:27:27 2015 UTC,"Security-minded developer here, sorry for the wall of text, I got a little off topic with the rant but hopefully it's mildly interesting.  What you mentioned about nuclear missiles is called MFA (Multi Factor Authentication), and it's fantastic for a lot of things.   But if you required fingerprints or passwords from two or more employees every time you wanted to use the production code to upgrade the website or chase down a bug people would quickly find a way around it.  If they knew the system even a little, it's child's play to grab all of the data with a flash drive while employee #2 is playing candy crush on his phone (since this happens every few weeks in a perfect world, a lot more in the real world).   Encrypting users's data (with the exception of passwords) isn't possible here.  You can encrypt the data, but at some point the software needs to access the data to show matches, messages, etc.  The key would have to be accessible to the program, so at best it's loaded into memory on an encrypted ram disk (which it probably wasn't), but even then it's just obfuscation and not security.  It's kind of like needing to leave your key under the doormat when you go for a run, you can hide a key to a lockbox containing the house key but eventually someone will find the series of keys and open the door.  So security-wise, it's no better than leaving the door unlocked in the first place, and because of that the efficiency trade-off isn't worth it.   Passwords are a little different, generally they're not stored at all.  Instead, a hash is made by calculating the password to get a one way value and stored with the salt (very important but I won't get into that).  The user then types in their password which is again converted to a hash by combining it with the salt, and boom!  Password is never stored.  So unfortunately encrypting active data is not possible, though obfuscating it is.  Obfuscating just increases the amount of time to get in the door, but doesn't actually make it more secure.  To secure a system like this, you have to restrict access to the system's internals to keep them away from the data being used to run the site.  And that's all well and good, except that generally us programmers (like everyone else) make mistakes and/or aren't good at our jobs.  We all build on each other's work, and so if anything all the way down the chain (even including hardware) has a small mistake that's an attack vector which could potentially let them crash the system, corrupt data, or even run their own code to give them full access.  Even if all the code was perfect, like you said humans are always a weak point.  If just one trusted IT or developer got a job at the company and worked themselves into a mildly trusted role, they could pretty easily bypass an otherwise secure system.  Unfortunately keeping everything moving is generally greatly prioritized over being safe, you'd just have to get a job there and wait for an opening (I doubt it would take long).  My money is on that route because of the subject matter, though I wouldn't be at all surprised if a website like that had glaring security holes.  Security is never prioritized, it doesn't make money...although not doing it right can cost you everything.  Hopefully companies will start to finally learn that after a few dozen more go under because of hacks.  Tl;dr: One of the rules of security-if it's too onerous people will find ways to get around it, and humans are a weak link even if everything else is done right (which it almost never is)"
TrueReddit,3e03qw,dmun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:33:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for contributing that! I never complain about walls of text: real effort is what makes this a good sub.   So, I'd like to ask a few followup questions, if you don't mind. A lot of your comment is essentially arguing that ""perfect security is impossible,"" which I totally agree with. And, as I said much higher up, without knowing exactly what happened here, it's hard to draw any clear lessons from this incident. But it sounds like you do agree that there are a number of reasonable steps that companies can take that will improve (perhaps drastically improve) their security, if they were only willing to prioritize doing so.   I'm an engineer, so for me a lot of this comes down to cost-benefit.  And, from your comment, it sounds like companies are undervaluing the benefit (not being driven bankrupt by one disastrous hack) of implementing best security practices.   So my question is: how elastic is their spending/reward function here? If they increased funding/attention to security by, say, 50%, would they be achieving only incremental gains in security (1-5%), or is there low-hanging fruit that could net impressive gains for a small increase in attention/expenditure? For example, insisting that your IT staff work in pairs during debugging exercises when they have access to critical systems/data would quickly slash the danger of a lone wolf, because she would HAVE to have a particular accomplice. That could reduce the danger of an attack of that sort by a factor of hundreds, while, depending on exactly how the work was normally apportioned, only added a few percent to the operating budget. If this is the most dangerous attack (and it seems to be a candidate for Ashley Madison, based on their comments), I'd call that low-hanging fruit."
TrueReddit,3e03qw,nappythrill22,5,Tue Jul 21 16:06:29 2015 UTC,"but they DO advertise on a lot of other sites, so in that sense they are actively encouraging people who are on the fence to take the plunge, both by planting the idea AND by lowering the cost. So... I guess I think they're culpable!    That's slope many things can slip down-- for instance, does the existence of ""rape play"" or BDSM pornography plant the idea of rape by actively encouraging people to fantasize about doing the act? They facilitate the fantasy of an illegal act.   I suppose alcohol could be the same. Do the existence of bars make alcoholism more likely? Are the bars culpable or are the individual drinkers responsibile? Or both?  But you're absolutely right on a market punishing those who are loose with their security. Trust is rather huge in the cheaters market, I imagine."
TrueReddit,3e03qw,i_crap_on_your_head,5,Tue Jul 21 04:32:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, now it's MY turn to accuse YOU of false equivalence!   I'm not super-familiar with BDSM, but I am certain that practitioners understand that consent is absolutely essential. Similarly, I assume that people engaged in rape play also know the difference between play and actual rape. So I don't think either one is an example of ""encouraging the real thing"", any more than first-person-shooters encourage mass shootings, or Space Invaders encourages, um, alien genocide. From what I know of it, the evidence has not shown a relationship between simulated play and real world action.  But Ashley Madison wasn't facilitating a cheating fantasy, they were facilitating real cheating. It would, I think, only be equivalent to a BDSM community that actually offered you the opportunity to kidnap and torture someone. In that sense, Ashley Madison isn't on a slippery slope: it is squarely at the bottom of the hill.   Your bar comparison is... more problematic for me. Certainly, a bar directly facilitates alcoholism. There are laws about serving the obviously intoxicated, and these seek to reduce bars' direct culpability, but I admit that if I owned a bar, I would struggle with this moral question. I'm not sure I can answer it."

TrueReddit,3e03qw,dmun,4,Tue Jul 21 06:24:40 2015 UTC,"And that is not at all what Savage is talking about.  He is clearly saying that you don't know the details of the ""cheaters"" lives so a blanket condemnation is a puritanical gotcha.  Take Bill Clinton: Millions would vote for him for President right now, saying that he was the best President we've had in a long time, but many of those same people blanketly condemn ""cheaters"".  How can this cognitive dissonance exist?  Because there is a strong puritanical bent in America to condemn all extra-marital affairs, but when one sees a guy who does good things and whose wife has stood with him in their marriage, they conveniently cast aside there usual condemnation.  But, some anonymous fuck who opened an account on Ashley Madison because his wife, whom he loves, hasn't had sex with him in 10 years?  Burn him!"

It's a semantic point you obviously missed-- because whether we know if he had an arrangement with his wife or not is more or less besides the point.

TrueReddit,3e03qw,sar2120,3,Tue Jul 21 04:42:43 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the detailed reality of the CFO guy.  Gawker posted screenshots of his particular texts. They posted clear, well-lit images of the guy's face. They made clear who he was, what his job was, and made it clear that this was a very real individual, who has a wife and three children, and this specific life which you are somewhat familiar with now is being ruined right before your very eyes as you ready this article. And not only that, but the method by which this life is being ruined is by the dissemination of this personal information to a wide audience via this very blog post, meaning you as the reader are not only witnessing the destruction, you are a part of it.  So yeah, of course people felt like shit and got mad after reading that!  The Ashley Madison thing is just a massive data dump. It's just a list of millions of might-as-well-be-anonymous names and numbers. It's not personal at all.  If the hackers were to, one by one, post articles similar to the Gawker article, and introduce you to each person, their background, where they live and work, show you a few photos of them, tell you about their family life, and then go on to detail their Ashley Madison account activity.... you get the idea. The reaction would be much different.  It's the personal, relatable element that changes people's reactions."

Oh, ""and the [c-level exec] who [was] caught? Still [a] cheater.""

I was thinking of the classic cases of ""family values"" politicians not having those values, ""no welfare"" politicians having directly benefitted from public programs, self serving activists, etc..  What separates those situations is that the person has opened up the subject themselves. And in scrutinizing the choices of others they have invited scrutiny upon themselves. At least in equal measure to how invasive their actions are into other people's lives.  Furthermore, these are often issues of public policy.

TrueReddit,3e03qw,Lethal_Papercut,3,Tue Jul 21 02:19:10 2015 UTC,"Since we've already moved away from doing science here, I can safely explore at least my own attitude. I think there are a number of factors at stake here. There's the factor of journalistic standards. Personally, I think both the Condé-Nast executive is a dick for cheating on his wife (if that is the actual case), and Gawker are a bag of dicks for publishing something that has no business outside the private realm of the executive and his wife. Outing someone in the press for infidelities, barring any mitigating news factor (say, a public persona with a record for speaking strongly against infidelity), is sleazy.  I think another factor is the issue of pragmatism in the face of an unattainable perfect morality. As a human, I accept that our morality is something we strive for, and people slip up. Cheating happens. I hate it, but I tolerate it as a part of life. What sites like Ashley Madison do, however, is specifically facilitate immorality. I think there's a moral difference between:    being in a stable relationship and falling in love/lust with a coworker, or being in a stable relationship and making a conscious decision to cheat on your significant other, then subscribe to a bloody dating site designed specifically for this purpose.   So for me, the stuff that happens to Ashley Madison and its clients doesn't inhibit a certain amount of schadenfreude.  Because of the size of the hack, the way most of these people will be exposed will still be mild compared to being singled out in the national press. Barring celebrities caught in this net, most people will be protected from more public exposure by being a tiny blot in a huge pile of data."
TrueReddit,3e03qw,swampswing,9,Tue Jul 21 02:29:05 2015 UTC,"I don't have a particularly strong opinion about the Ashley Madison hack (yet) since the impact is unclear and the attackers' motives are obscure.   But I did happen to follow the mini-story this weekend about Gawker's outing of a corporate executive's gay affair, and, like Dan Savage, I found myself perplexed by the differing reactions to these [essentially] doxxing attacks on cheaters about whom we really know very little.   Right now, I think this article best articulates my evolving opinion, and I think it makes a good contribution to this developing story. As usual with Savage, the writing is crisp, readable, and credible."
TrueReddit,3e03qw,Inebriator,4,Tue Jul 21 06:21:13 2015 UTC,The attackers' claimed motive is that Ashley Madison charged people $19 to delete all their data and then didn't delete all the user data. They're hoping to extort them out of business as a form of vigilante justice.
TrueReddit,3e03qw,yetiman223,3,Mon Jul 20 22:49:51 2015 UTC,"Do you think that's their actual motive, or just an excuse for the attack? I'm not denying it, just curious for your read."
TrueReddit,3e03qw,brandonclyon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:52:12 2015 UTC,"So I don't doubt that they'd be outraged at that. It fits the hacker mindset to be pissed off at people selling security products that don't work. But this doesn't explain what they were doing in AMs network in the first place, it seems unlikely they were in there on the off chance that AM was doing something unethical and if they weren't they'd have just left. On the other hand this is supposed to be the work of someone with inside access, AM were saying they knew who; if this is the case then it's suggests that it's someone who was kicking up a stink about this but got ignored and decided to take direct action."

To take a third example, if gawker had outed a republican senator who voted against gay rights, I doubt there would be much outcry against gawker.  There are many shades of perceived morality. I suspect that people react to what they see as the worst aspect of any similarly complicated situation, this does not mean that the other aspects, considered in isolation, are palatable."

The Ashley Madison thing only interests me from a security perspective.  Maybe if I were paranoid and married, I'd try to search my spouse's name in the data.  The male escort essentially tried to blackmail the executive, and Gawker advocated it by reporting the information.

Discussion doesn't easily take place in the midst of censorship."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,MercuryCobra,14,Mon Jul 20 17:59:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, in the grand scheme of things the marketplace of ideas should work to bend the arc of history towards justice and truth. But reddit is not a perfect speech platform by way of its institutional organization. The fact that you can up and downvote comments completely undermines free speech principles, as do the sorting algorithms. All it takes is concerted efforts by small groups of people  early in the life of a post to propel terrible ideas to the top of a thread. Once it's there it is likely to stay there, since people like agreeing with people everyone else seems to agree to. Even if it does slip, the ideas it contains still have way more visibility and therefore more power. Meanwhile it only takes a handful of votes to bury the opposing viewpoint such that nobody will ever see it. Not only does this mean you rarely get full and fair discussion, but since users see other users rewarded for expressing certain viewpoints it incentivizes those viewpoints to be expressed, which turns whole threads into self-congratulatory posters agreeing with each other and down voting (censoring) detractors. This positive feedback loop eventually drives out dissenters and drives those left behind into ever more extreme positions.  And besides reddit's design flaws, reddit's demographics also tend to indicate that a full marketplace of ideas may not work that well here. Reddit skews exceptionally young, exceptionally white, and exceptionally male. Which makes it extremely easy to stump and/or target messages such that the majority of redditor a will agree adopt certain positions unquestioningly that other demographics might take issue with or argue against. But because of reddit's homogeneity and design, these voices are unlikely to be heard and those positions are more and more likely to be considered obviously correct by those inside the reddit vacuum chamber. The ""young"" portion is important as well. Many redditor a are in high school or college; they may be smart but they're still teenagers, and teenagers are notoriously easy to manipulate based on social cues and peer pressure. They're also the most at risk for being taken in by propaganda from hate groups looking to recruit. And the evidence that those efforts have been successful is all over reddit: how many times have you seen that ""black crime statistics"" copy pasta that was literally composed by Stormfront up voted into the triple digits? It doesn't take much to convince a white teen pissed off about how he didn't get into the school he wanted ""because of affirmative action,"" that no he's not wrong to be angry, and stoke that resentment into racism."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,kahrahtay,6,Mon Jul 20 19:52:21 2015 UTC,"I think you have many valid criticisms and the voting system certainly has it's drawbacks, but that doesn't mean that there isn't value in the current model, or that censorship by a central authority is a better alternative.     This positive feedback loop eventually drives out dissenters and drives those left behind into ever more extreme positions.     My anecdotal observations are that opposing groups tend to react by retreating to their safe haven subreddits, where they simply regroup until the next topic starts the conversation over again. In many instances bad ideas may win out for the reasons that you describe, but more often than not the argument with the best information seems to win."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,baskandpurr,21,Mon Jul 20 20:28:33 2015 UTC,"Would you believe that sexism and anti-feminism are different concepts in fact?

TrueReddit,3dxwvh,MercuryCobra,3,Mon Jul 20 18:22:25 2015 UTC,"They're really not different. Feminism is dedicated to eradicating sex discrimination and leveling the playing field for all sexes and genders. Being against that is to be against sexual equality i.e. to support sexism. You can be against certain methods or theories offered by specific feminists, but to be against feminism generally is to support sexism."

TrueReddit,3dxwvh,Serei,9,Mon Jul 20 22:16:34 2015 UTC,"They are. I've met a grand total of zero people who are against eradicating sex discrimination. Everyone I've met who calls themself anti-feminism is against the actions or theories of various specific feminists, or often of most people who call themselves feminists.  You shouldn't put words into their mouths.  It's like with communists: Most people who are anti-communism are against the actions of most people who call themselves communists, not against the idea that workers should be treated fairly and equally."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,fyrenmalahzor,7,Mon Jul 20 22:40:31 2015 UTC,"Then you still have the problem of unifying very disparate movements into a homogenous one and then going ""I disagree with this, all of it.""   Let's say you're an anti-feminist are you against Liberal Feminism? or are you against Radical or Socialist Feminism? Are you against Radical Feminism because of implicit gender essentialism? What about some radical feminists that address and try to work through the implicit gender essentialism? Do you disagree with them?  Or is it that you disagree with their focus on sex and gender as discursive entities and their use of post-structuralist analysis? Maybe you think ""X"" isn't an example of sexism, which would probably have to do with how you analyze sexism. If you're a liberal, you probably tend to be highly individualistic and atomistic in your thinking, so you would disagree with the way that a Marxist or a Structuralist/Post-Structuralist would analyze social relations. Or maybe you're a Marxist-Leninist with feminists leanings and you think that gender analysis should come secondary to class analysis. I'm enormously pro-feminist but I'm against the ""Beaddel"" movement of trans-lesbian separatism because they've proven that they utilize trans-separatism to entrap and abuse other trans women by socially isolating them, but that doesn't mean I'm against feminism. My problem is that most people I meet that claim to be anti-feminist have literally no idea what they're talking about when it comes to feminism. They whine about ""third wave feminism"" and then describe (poorly and inaccurately I might add) ideologies that were dominant in the second wave. Then when you point this out to them they call you an SJW, which is a useless and completely nebulous term that means absolutely nothing."

Probably a fucking feminist, jew nigger.  Without them seeing that other people, regardless of race, culture, economics, whatever, are just people regardless of the difference, they are likely to ascribe whatever traits they want to people, to keep them in line with their expectations of those groups.  and shit, homes."

TrueReddit,3dxwvh,created4this,15,Mon Jul 20 16:28:13 2015 UTC,"Reddit serves as an echo chamber, if you select your subreddits you'll end up with your views interspersed with mainstream news as if they are equally shared.   Let's say you have stumbled into a room where the people in that room consider all women to be genetically subservient, and the role of men is to rule them. In this room it's ok to do what others would call rape because no doesn't always mean no. For some reason you find this sub appealing and you join the sub, you might not even agree with the content but you like the arguments.  Soon it looks like this is an accepted point of view, it doesn't matter if this community is made up of only 1000 people worldwide, it appears mainstream. Now it's OK for you to treat women like objects because you read it ""on the front page of the Internet""  Hate speech works in the same way, find a group to vilify, and you'll find a Reddit where it's ok to treat these people as if they are subhuman, you'll find news stories that match this agenda, Mexican gangs who rape, black people who murder, British terrorists, 1%ers who mug the homeless. Subscribe and soon your weak prejudice will be reinforced to s raging fire."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,Karunamon,4,Mon Jul 20 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting theory, and intuitively it makes sense, but I wonder if reality bears it out?  I think that the radicals of the type that frequent coontown and stormfront and other racist groups are under no misconceptions that their ideas are mainstream - what you just described right here doesn't require any special arcane knowledge of how reddit works.. it's just one of the most basic things.

It costs $10 to make an account, and $10 to unban yourself. Until you get banned enough times and then you get permabanned.

However, the rest of the subs and sites still function, allowing users to customize it however we wish to see it (so long as we use subs and multireddit, as examples).  This large demographic, though, is what a large number of viewers see, and thus more people are around to talk about what they saw there rather than their own customized front page (as the article states)."

Would another president do an AMA if this site's reputation deteriorates? The more popular a user driven site gets the more I think its users will need to take collective responsibility for its image, beyond just the current written and unwritten reddiquette. Reddit users didn't hate Ellen Pao for being a woman, but upvoting comments that can be perceived as sexist does not help our image. Protesting a fat shaming subreddit by upvoting pictures of fat people on a very popular subreddit hurt the image or perception that certain behavior is isolated.   I don't disagree that reddits public image gets misconstrued outside of its user base but we can be our own worst enemy.

It's gotten to a point where it encompasses just about every fathomable prong of interest, profession, hobby, sport, academia, and western culture imaginable. It's so broad that it's unavoidable that rotten apples will start stinking up a few barrels. Luckily, and like you and many others point out, we have a choice in which barrels we want to dip our hands in.

It absolutely leaks over into other areas. I can't tell you have many times I've been in various gaming subs and seen someone flip their shit on someone else because because they said something even midly socially conscious.   But that isn't the problem anyway. Coontown aren't angry about SJW, they're angry about black people. Theredpill wasn't created out of reaction to SJW antics, they're just sexual predators. Fatpeoplehate couldn't give a shit, they're just bullies. And absolutely none of them keep their bullshit in the designated subs."

The reason you see gaming subs push back against socially conscious ideas is because we've been bitten many times by people thinking they have some sort of moral superiority over normal people who happen to share a hobby. From concerned politicians trying to enforce limitations on a medium they don't understand because thinking of the children gives them a larger name on the ballot to feminists crusading against games because their worldview states that everything is harmful no matter how innocuous, we see it all the time. It doesn't help that the more vocal people who advocate for social justice are also disgusting bullies in their own right (see: tumblr/twitter trends, sites like Gawker, the entirety of third wave internet feminism). Trust me, there's just as much hatred for the corporate establishment as there is for SJWs on reddit. It's why you see just as much if not more pushback against the big publishers like EA and Ubisoft when they do something anti consumer as when some moral crusader tries to gentrify their hobby. You might just be seeing the pushback against SJWs because you agree with them which isn't a bad thing, it's just a matter of perspective.  This is really all I can speak for seeing as gaming subs make up the majority of the content I browse on reddit.

I think the news media thinks Reddit is disgusting because that's the only part of Reddit that is worth covering on the news. They see it all the time, so that disproportionately colors their impression. Much like how ER doctors see broken legs and concussions all the time, when the world is in reality much safer.  Now, there is a problem with obliviously racist or sexist comments. But if you can ignore those, then Reddit isn't half bad."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,redwhiskeredbubul,61,Mon Jul 20 17:16:15 2015 UTC,"Reddit is a cracked mirror. It's not an accurate reflection of social attitudes at large, but it is a reflection of them: there's misogyny and racism on reddit because there is misogyny and racism in society at large. The constant straw-manning and hand-wringing about how Reddit is especially racist or misogynistic mostly reflects the fact that depending on where you live, it's actually easier to filter the existence of that stuff out in real life than on the internet, because real life isn't set up as a system of anonymous soapboxes. In real life you're actually often completely protected from hearing divergent opinions. For example, It's people from rural Alabama talking to people from Portland, and the people from Portland getting shocked.  It's people from stepped-on working class backgrounds talking to people from east coast liberal arts colleges. Once you notice this (that it is a diverse userbase, at least more so than the people who, say, write content for buzzfeed or wherever) a lot of the persistent refrains about x or y problem on reddit make sense as reflections of peoples' life biases.   The most amusing thing is that if there's a single group that is genuinely marginalized, unrepresented, and deplored systematically on Reddit in a way wildly out of sync with the rest of society, it's right-wing evangelical Christians."

It's gone way, way downhill even in the five years I've been here, and racism, misogyny, etc. are huge problems there.   The defaults used to be worth going to, but now rape apologia, holocaust questioning, and ""race realism"" are not uncommon things to encounter, and raging against ""feminists"" and ""SJWs"" is downright commonplace, predominant even.

A lot of the culture around it reflected that, for example using ""fag"" used as a suffix for all users of the site. Speaking from experience, a lot of us who used the site dealt with being called that or worse on a daily basis in college and highschool. Having a place where everyone jokingly used it and satirized its power in real life was liberating and often funny.    Unfortunately, it turns out when you pretend to act like a bunch of dumbasses for a laugh, it makes the dumbasses feel welcome. The remnants of this culture are left over, reddit often still likes to ape phrases like, ""OP is a fag!"" but it's core is dead. OP was a fag because we all were, we were those who had been bullied and labeled that way our whole lives. For you to be the sort of person to be contributing to our community you had to be the sort that was insulted and belittled by others.   Now, 4chan descended into something else entirely. The culture is now obsessed with social justice and has become infested with actual racists, homophobes, holocaust deniers, and facists.

I think a large cause of this is due to a relatively unchanged number of original content creators being drowned out by a huge number of crap posters, and then being voted on by a huge number of people that can't or don't differentiate between the former and the latter.

You have a sense of protection in anonymity of a crowd.  You have the effect of herd mentality.  This is just much stronger online.  You're much more anonymous.

I don't think that the committed anti-feminst types are a majority (and the racists certainly aren't) but they're so loud and active that they frequently control conversation, if not content, in the defaults.  What I regard as the main misogynist and racist subs are all under three years old. There were surely elements before that, but it's relatively recently that it's become entrenched."

There were surely elements before that, but it's relatively recently that it's become entrenched.   I think its largely a reaction to things like /r/shitredditsays (4 years old). There were some racists/misogynists around, a sub was established with the intent of ""bullying the bullies"" and when they felt like they were under attack they started looking to organize. Once the communities were established, they attracted users who were probably not here at all before.   Of course, I'm not sure about any of this and I don't know how well this has been studied. This is all based of my own personal impressions over the last few years.   In parallel to this, the rise of social justice blogging has radicalized a large portion of internet culture both for and against it's ideals and methods. This has provided many fresh recruits from the general reddit population allowing these subs to surge in numbers."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,rocktheprovince,4,Mon Jul 20 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"Shitredditsays isn't really that large- not that active- and are much easier to avoid than, say, fatpeoplehate was. They don't go out of their way to bully the bullies, they just sit in their own area and talk about them. They rarely spill over anywhere else.   You could look at the online rallies white-supremacist sites like stormfront have held trying to get people to come over to reddit. They provide scripts and everything. And beyond that you can chalk a lot of it up to the demographic. From things like theredpill to the immature ramblings in /politics and /worldnews.   But to say this is all a reaction to shitredditsays is, IMO, false, or at least a huge oversimplification."

It's got more popular, meaning there's more of it, is exactly the user's point.  And I agree. I've only been on reddit two years and I feel like things took a huge turn for the worst from about the fappening onwards - it seems like around then the free speech/censorship ""movement"" started along with FPH and suddenly a lot of out of the way subs started seeing that kind of stuff wandering into their otherwise apolitical communities."

Redditors have the same priveledge of just avoiding what they disagree with. I  hope most don't do this.  I agree with some of the other posts on here that say exposing yourself to opposing views can lead to a higher understanding of our human condition.  Reddit is so huge that it can't avoid having some malcontents and assholes. Either engage with them to change their minds or move on. The choice is yours.

Discuss whether value is added to the community (from which you only consume content) when you shut your eyes to the bad parts? Should you intervene and shed light on a more ""noble"" viewpoint?  The irony of pointing out polarizing events on Reddit with your own bias rather than discussing both sides of the issue?

TrueReddit,3dxwvh,waldron76,5,Mon Jul 20 18:09:17 2015 UTC,"It's true that reddit is definitely, to some extent, what you make of it. But there is still a dominant, overriding culture here that is fairly pervasive. Obviously it doesn't permeate into subreddits that specifically prevent it (e.g. many explicitly political subreddits), but in subreddits that are otherwise neutral, there definitely a universal culture that you won't find in more decentralised social media sites like Twitter and Tumblr.   reddit is quite curiously structured - a theoretically infinite number of boards in which all content is both created by the users and, for the most part, curated by the users, boards which are simultaneously separate from each other, but coexistant within the same site structure, and with the same users. It's almost like a megaforum, bringing all the disparate strands of human interest under one roof.  This unique structure is what allows specific subreddits to develop their own individual culture, while simultaneously retaining characteristics of the wider culture of the site. Wherever you go on reddit (once again, with the exception of subreddits that are, for whatever reason, biased against a certain attribute of reddit's overarching cultural climate), you'll find: a vaguely libertarian political and social philosophy; an appetite and appreciation for science-fiction, comic books, and other typical hallmarks of 'nerd culture'; a tendency towards intellectualism, and towards placing more value on logic and reason than emotion; a love of reference humour (especially self-referential meta-humour) and puns; and a tendency towards contrarianism, both against the dominate cultural zeitgeist, and against the current trends of the reddit community itself.  These things, in my mind, are the most obvious hallmarks of reddit's culture. They're not quite constants - there is some dissent in certain communities, as I mentioned, as well as the natural fluctuations that come with time - but they're pervasive enough that I think it's fair to say reddit has an identifiable sitewide culture, albeit one that is vague and changeable."

TrueReddit,3dxwvh,toomuchweightloss,6,Tue Jul 21 02:00:28 2015 UTC,"This is largely my experience with Reddit, too, with even a high level of overlapping subreddits (Hi Tamar, we're in the same ""fight club"", maybe we've chatted). But I also see the racism, misogyny, other bigotry, threats of violence, defenses of the indefensible (see: various genocides) because I am also a mod of a large subreddit and thus get to see the shit everyone else does not. BTW, you can't go into my profile to see what sub(s) I moderate, because this is not my mod account. I had to abandon my mod account to mod actions and use what was meant to be a throwaway, because I don't feel safe connecting ""Reddit mod"" to ""woman"" to ""mother."" The threats and messages I get are already violent and disgusting--I really don't need them to add on threats to hunt me down and hurt/kill/rape my kids. Which has happened to other mods who are women with kids. I would dearly love Reddit to crack down on the hate on this site, because it does hurt people and drive people away. I sure as hell would never have signed up had the defaults been the first thing I saw--they were pretty much ""not me"" even back most of six years ago when I first found this site through a newspaper comments section link to a subreddit. Even though I can see the potential and good side and do absolutely believe that Reddit is an incredibly powerful resource and outlet that's essentially unmatched, I can't possibly tell others to join in good faith, knowing the abuse they're likely to take on the way. I know ""that's just the way the internet is"", but does it have to be? Why?"
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,duffmanhb,10,Mon Jul 20 16:00:05 2015 UTC,"I think that's a huge issue with people online. All those threats and trolls, are completely empty and meaningless. But people new to internet culture tend to get shocked. That some troll will say something offensive, just to get a reaction, and someone will take it seriously as if the stranger actually wants to murder them, or even means what they say.  I think the issue is people unfamiliar just don't know how to handle the nature of the beast, and it all comes as a surprise."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,toomuchweightloss,6,Mon Jul 20 16:15:37 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be threatened, whether empty of meaning or full of it, and I'd bet most people don't want to be, either. I reject the notion that threats online are harmless, because they are silencing. Minorities and women have said over and over and over that they are afraid to be who they are, afraid to speak their opinions, on the internet because of the vitrolic threats and backlash they know they will get. That's not hyperbole, oversensitivity, or exaggeration. It's been documented time and again, and people's unwillingness to listen to these voices betrays the same sort of bigotry and bias women and minorities are trying to speak against to begin with.   And with people actually being doxxed and having their comments on Reddit or other internet forums come back to harm them personally and professionally, you can't just dismiss it as ""trolls wanting to get a reaction."" Yes, some or even a majority of the comments are just that, but you never know when one of them actually is serious, and that's not something I'd like to play around with."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,RedAero,5,Mon Jul 20 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"Hear hear.  I think the fundamental problem is that the internet has so thoroughly invaded real life that people treat it as an extension of reality, as opposed to the completely isolated digital alternate reality it actually is. The barrier to entry is now non-existent, so people who are not equipped to handle the consequences of anonymity also join in, stroll along unaware for a while, then all of a sudden they stumble upon a genuine, unsullied corner of the internet, and then it's all shock and horror, ""Something must be done, won't somebody please think of the children!"".  Back when I joined the internet you couldn't go 15 minutes before someone tried to trick you into visiting a shock site, which very neatly kept the unprepared and the emotionally fragile outside. Now I'm fairly sure I'd get banned from reddit if I posted goatse.cx across a few defaults for shits and giggles."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,duffmanhb,4,Mon Jul 20 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"That's sort of what makes me roll my eyes when someone online complains about all the ""sexism"" and ""hateful"" comments. The average person is pretty good at just ignoring them, because it really is just annoying background noise. But it seems like some people can't just ignore it, and instead focus in on it. Almost to obsessive levels.  It blows me away that there are people who actually take random internet comments from idiots as personal attacks. These people remind me of the whole Amy's Baking Co fiasco. The lady would get trolls saying mean things to her, and she took it literally. She cared so much what these people said about her. It's just mind blowing."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,RedAero,3,Mon Jul 20 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And the funny thing is no one seems to realize that there's a connection between these elevated levels of trolling and their reaction to it. ""Don't feed the trolls"" is one of the main rules of the internet, because any other reaction simply encourages them. And then you get the do-goodies who think they know better, who try and fight trolls with their elevated rhetoric, bless their hearts, and they truly don't understand why it won't work. They truly, deeply don't understand that the way you handle a bully in real life and the way you handle one on the internet are not in any way related."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,BritishHobo,3,Mon Jul 20 17:18:18 2015 UTC,"Nah, I think this is such an easy misdirect, and honestly it needs to stop. People find it so easy to brush off everything hateful and offensive online as just things nobody actually means. 'Troll' has become such a broad label now, it's almost meaningless.  If people are regularly having discussions motivated by racism and sexism, and spreading those opinions over the site, you can't just go 'ah it's trolls they don't mean it'. Yes, plenty of them do. There are racist and sexist people and hey, look, they're posting on the internet just like the rest of us."
TrueReddit,3dxwvh,RedAero,4,Mon Jul 20 21:53:28 2015 UTC,"I know ""that's just the way the internet is"", but does it have to be? Why?   Because that's the way people are when they can genuinely, freely express themselves. Your issue is with humanity, not with the internet. Sure, you can try and fight these things, but you'll just turn the internet into a digital meatspace and in the process you'll lose everything that made the place worthwhile to begin with.

When people say reddit is turning to shit, that it's rampant with racism, sexism, nazis, and pedophiles, they're obviously talking about the make up of the defaults.  The defaults and larger subs are what brings people to this site. Lets not forget that r/jailbait, r/niggers, r/creepshots, and r/fatpeoplehate were some of the most active subreddits on this site during their peaks.  You don't judge something by the minor details, you look at it as a whole. It's like saying that Detroit is an awesome city because of its art scene and the young hipster community, while ignoring the massive debt, structural issues, and crazy high crime rate.  Sure, if you ignore all the bad stuff, the things that the majority of users are interacting with, reddit is great.

TrueReddit,3dxwvh,Thomas-C,5,Mon Jul 20 20:31:46 2015 UTC,"There used to be more comments about how reddit was turning into 4chan. Users from there were purportedly migrating, and thus ""polluting"" reddit with their dumbassery and shenanigans. That attitude seems to have been replaced with a quiet resignation, a sense of ""ah well that infamous hacker 4chanz is back"".  What's funny is that the mainstream portrayal is pretty much the same as 4chan's back in its media heyday. The only thing we need is a lady buying curtains and a dog and it's like coming full circle.  A bunch of sensitive folk getting uptight about how something needs to be regulated because they got their feelings hurt, countered by an exceedingly loud minority of dumbasses.  In the meantime your average user just looks at what they want and goes about their day.   Post-reddit, it will happen all over again. A slightly different veneer over the same dynamic. Reason being, it winds up this way no matter what is ""done"" about it. If reddit starts to limit itself and change its rules, folks will start to leave, until it simply isn't the community it is now (whether that's good or bad is up to you); on the other hand, letting everyone roam free results in the same thing - eventually the community becomes so different, that folks begin to look elsewhere.  In my mind, trying to make Reddit enforce anything is like trying to fix something that isn't actually broken. The community itself will change as time goes on, and reddit will change accordingly. It will also inevitably fade into irrelevance, as 4chan largely has (with respect to your mainstream media folks, that is). Let the social creatures be social - they'll take care of themselves in one way or another. If reddit is doomed to a reputation of being a racist, bigoted cesspool, it is because of forces with which they can't contend. They can try, but pushing against the fundamental ignorance of humanity isn't something they're suited for - that's what the rest of humanity is suited for dealing with, on vastly different terms.  Edit: I realize I didn't make this relevant to the article. The woman who customizes her subs is the example of ""going elsewhere"" I try to point out. She understands the site well enough to do that, and has created for herself the Reddit that appeals to her. She did the ""fixing"", enforced her own brand of banning particular things, people, viewpoints. The same is true for anyone else, and they express it differently - I'm sure if, somehow, r/2xchromosomes became a hive of men's rights folks, she'd unsubscribe. While she can't prevent a bunch of people doing that (however unlikely it is), she can remove herself from it. The same holds true for the site as a whole - it will change, and people will regulate themselves. The folks in charge of reddit cannot do that effectively. They're very much beholden to their users, not in charge of them; the best they can do is along the lines of what they've been doing so far, that is, banning subs whose users commit actions with powerful negative consequences, in the name of that sub. The woman is right - it is like a microcosm. This dynamic is what it was like moving from one site to another several years ago, and now it's all in the one place."

Hierarchies were being leveled out. We were going to do things better.   The lack of self awareness of this guy is incredible. Any literate person born after say, 1800 (and thus the enlightenment) should be able to understand that Twitter mobs were  never  a good thing. I remember the early days of Twitter shaming, before the backlash against it started becoming more widespread. It was always evident to anyone with an iota of conscience that it was disgusting that people rushed to tear someone's life apart based on what essentially boiled down to rumors (particularly the glee and savagery with which they did it). The author acts as if he's unearthed the revolutionary concept that maybe faceless mob justice that ignores facts, context, and rigor is a bad thing. Give him another couple of centuries and maybe he'll give a Ted talk about his astounding discovery of the concept of due process.

TrueReddit,3e3yg1,whatabear,2,Tue Jul 21 19:45:15 2015 UTC,"Submission Statement  The New Age movement began in the 19th century when Europeans traveled the world and constructed new spiritual and/or pseudo-scientific theories out of the fragments of the various cultures they encountered. These were weird and unsubstantiated beliefs, but they were mostly innocuous until the early 20th century when they were co-opted by German nationalists, and, eventually, Nazis. New Age adherents do not generally associate with racist movements any more, but the implicit belief in the superiority of Western civilization remains.  The article claims that Hitler distanced himself from New Age stuff when he came to power, but Nazi ideology was still very much based on it. There is a very interesting documentary by Michael Wood (the guy who did the Story of India series) called Hitler and the Holy Grail which does a great job describing New Age (and extremely absurd) beliefs of the top SS leadership all the way to the end."

The TPP has been negotiated for close to 10 years now by 12 different countries by so many different people representing competing interests.  Multinational corporations don't have people going up to the meetings calling all the shots or bribing anyone (or at the very least there doesn't seem to be any credible evidence for this).  This free trade agreement is being driven by policy-makers, not by corporate representatives.    Not only that, but as far as I'm concerned there are plenty of really good reasons as to why the TPP negotiations have been so private.  If the meetings were made public so that every competing political party of every country and every political pundit and every armchair economist could chime in and make noise about what should be in the agreement and what should be off limits for negotiation, how would anything get agreed upon?  This particular trade agreement is actually no different from most trade agreements in it's privacy.    I'm also linking to another thread in /r/PoliticalDiscussion that generated very thoughtful counterpoints to the general contentiousness towards the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  I think this provides a great deal of insight on how trade agreements really come to fruition, why the secrecy really isn't unusual, and why the negative rhetoric really lead to a lot of misunderstanding about the deal will really do."
TrueReddit,3dzp5i,honorable_doofus,3,Tue Jul 21 05:20:05 2015 UTC,"My take on this is this kind of agreement is negotiated in private because had it been done in public, all the parties involved would have to justify themselves in the media, in front of the public (voters). That means political careerists cannot do what they want (which, let's remind ourselves of that, should be in the interest of the greater good) under the fear of having a negative public image and their careers ruined.  Instead of finding a solution to that state of facts and maybe think about dissociating politics from money making careers and educating the public on what kind of bullshit they read/watch on the media, they just made the deals secret. Secrecy in important decision making, in democracies... How long does it have to take for people to realize they're walking on their heads?

TrueReddit,3dzp5i,OsmoZ,3,Tue Jul 21 19:42:18 2015 UTC,"Perhaps negotiating it in secret is appropriate, but combined with Fast Track Authority, it virtually guarantees that no one (neither the public nor members of Congress) will fully know what is in the treaty until AFTER it is approved.  In my view, picking one (either secret negotiation OR fast track) is ok, because that would allow it to be reviewed. But, trying to do both, which essentially makes a thorough review impossible, hints that they don't WANT it to be reviewed.

That is not an accident, and you have to ask yourself why that would be the case? Well obviously it's because it contains some objectionable measures that would rightfully be contested.   There is an argument to be made for not hashing out every minute detail for fear it will be taken and run with, effectively torpedoing the entire process. That argument cannot excuse the complete and deliberate lack of transparency for the piece of legislation. It is almost unbelievable that a reasonably minded person without a vested interest or ulterior motive in the TPPs passage would suggest that there's nothing underhanded about the manner in which the TPP has been developed. That's exactly what you did. Policy-makers are driving this bill? How naive are you to believe that policy makers are insulated from corporate interests?

These people were sought out by policy-makers in order to better understand what how certain proposals would affect the markets they work inside of, which is a good thing because governments of all countries involved aren't omniscient.    By the way, what's wrong with labor unions being sought out for free trade agreements?  I thought the whole reason why people were opposed to the TPP was because they were afraid it would do nothing to benefit labor.  If the diplomats coming up with the terms are seeking out groups that represent corporate and labor interests, then can you really argue that the creators of the TPP aren't listening to labor?  Hell, the biggest reason why congressional Democrats have been opposed to this agreement is because they are afraid it will only serve corporate interests.    In either case, the real truth is that we don't really know what's in the agreement.  We know what the overarching goals are (supposedly), but the finer details are all just speculation.

TrueReddit,3e1cdn,P_leoAtrox,5,Tue Jul 21 05:03:40 2015 UTC,"This ties into what I do for a living, and although I could certainly write an essay about it, much of what I'll say boils down to two things:   Pregnancy Stressful environments during pregnancy yield low-birth weights, which are correlated with lower brain surface area. At birth, children from poor homes with high degrees of what is called 'toxic stress', have about 6% less brain surface area.  Parent-Child Interactions before age 3 There's a profound link between parental income + education and the amount of time spent interacting (verbally) with a child. Researchers found, as early as 1992, that household income predicted conversational turns with young children, and, in turn, conversational turns before age 3 predicted IQ at age 5   Feeding into point 2 is a growing consensus that the majority of neurological pathway development happens within the first 3 years of life, and that children with insufficient levels of parental engagement will have more poorly developed neurological pathways.  As these children grow older, they will struggle with absorption of new data and processing verbal and mathematical problems for the rest of their lives, and no matter what intervention is attempted, they will never catch up. Their 'window' for development is closed.  Moreover, there has been no single academic intervention we've seen (after age 5) that yields more than a tiny impact on student performance (we're talking 1-2% improvement on a standardized test), and frequently these interventions are not duplicable or transferable.  So, we can shrink class sizes, move the kids to charter or private schools, use computers in the classrooms, hire 'highly-trained' teachers, bust up unions, switch to 'project-based learning', bus poor kids to rich neighborhoods, etc... and none of it has but the smallest impact.

There are numerous strategies to raise wages and reduce poverty. Most are unpopular in the US.  I am completely unopposed to an aggressive refocus toward technical/vocational education at the middle-and-high school levels.

No, it doesn't solidify your point at all.  You said they nitpicked when in reality they didn't even think it worth their time responding to you.  Besides, just about every other thread on here is people discussing this topic, you could literally read nearly any other response.  Instead, I'll 'prove your point' and 'nitpick' him (apparently denigrating legitimate discussion and response by calling it 'nitpicking' is your tactic though).  Let me start by saying that before I ever heard anything Rowe said off-air, I was a big fan of the guy.  Since I saw him give a talk at a convention aimed at getting kids interested in science and technology I've completely changed my opinions of him.  What he said there was very in-line with this article.  My main issues begin with Rowe's disconnect from reality.  His message can be summed up as 'do what gets you paid,' and in so saying he advocates a generally tough life for most people while he himself lives a relatively cushy life (yes yes, I saw the pics of his apartment, hurray, he still has an easy job that pays him well, takes little toll on his health, and most likely provides him lots of benefits).  The problem is, he talks about a lot of jobs that need filling that absolutely won't help people break out of their current shitty cycle of poverty.  He wants people to accept minimum wage jobs, which are unlivable, particularly in many of the locations such as major cities where there are job openings.  Pardon me for thinking that anyone who works a full time job should be able to live a modest life without accruing debt, I must be the crazy one.  He also implies that we should all live our lives revolved around getting paid.  I'm sorry, but that's just not my goal, and I'm sure that's true of many others.  I'm no automaton, and on top of that I have morals, ethics, and principles that guide my actions.  I will not work for an oil company, or a company making weapons for the military, or a company doing major environmental damage, etc.  Again, Rowe's position is basically 'take what you can get that'll pay you' but I'll add 'and ignore the rest.'  This is politically blind advice and inevitably comes back to bite the worker in the ass.  If I think the minimum wage is too low, that sick leave and vacation should be standard, the 40 hour work week needs a return (and even to be lowered to 30-35 hour weeks), and single-payer healthcare should be a right for every citizen, I won't take a job that doesn't provide these requirements or in many cases actively fights these things politically.  You may think I'm just some kid with a liberal arts degree (or no degree at all!) and guess what: you'd be dead wrong.  But you know what?  That doesn't mean I don't think people with liberal arts degrees or no degree at all aren't valuable.  They deserve these same minimum standards, all people do because they're people.  So another thing that bothers me a lot about Rowe is his constant, empty criticism of liberal arts degrees and really university education as a whole.  His whole view point seems to be summed up as 'bury your head in the sand and get paid.'  He even implies that people toiling away their lives for less than they're worth so that CEOs and boards of directors can get stupidly fucking rich is what makes someone a productive member of society.  No no, just put your head down and work hard at something you hate and you'll be fine.  That's the wisdom of Mike Rowe.  Most of the jobs that he's advocating for are probably on the chopping block for automation in the near future too, so there's no longevity to any of it.  Physical labor is the biggest target for automation in all of its forms.  People are far more expensive than nearly anything else in industry.  Seems a little short-sighted to be suggesting that people enter into those markets, doesn't it?  These are just the issues I came up with off the top of my head after reading the article.  I recall being pretty infuriated after seeing him talk, but that was a couple of years ago and I don't remember the details at this point.  I think there's plenty of valid concern over what Rowe is advocating and it doesn't mean that I think everyone should be a winner or that everyone deserves a trophy.  The guy uses the term 'Captains of Industry.'  Seriously, who the fuck says that?  Some sort of corporate puppet?  Or just Ayn Rand fanboys?  He even extols the virtue of Thomas Edison... maybe someone should send him The Oatmeal's comic about Nikola Tesla?  Nah man, I don't think Rowe is right, I don't even think he's a good role model.  And the only thing that changed my mind was listening to him talk when he wasn't handed a script (or maybe he was...)."

Eg it's assumed that anyone can write, with enough practice. They can't.   Just because you love something doesn't mean you are or will ever be any good at it.   By all means ""follow your passions"" with a hobby. When it comes to earning a living wage, aim for something that you can do competently that has value for someone else."

There's probably a job for a double major in Medieval Studies and French Literature, but there's only one in the whole country. So when colleges have droves of graduates with these hyper-specific humanities degrees, even the very skilled among them won't get jobs.

I think that's an attitude that a lot of hiring managers hold but don't necessarily express, especially from the Baby Boomer/Gen X era before even basic clerical work required a BA. Personally I think it's kind of shitty that our generation is expected to plunge ourselves into enormous debt to prove we ""did something,"" and it sets up those who were unable to for whatever reason - some of whom would be far happier in non-academic professions - to feel they're worth less because they lack that piece of paper."

In the past students would often get a job in research or teach, but now there aren't enough jobs for that (at any level: Ph.D, MS, BS).  When I was in college there was the perception that if you didn't major in engineering or science you're never going to find a job.  Now I think engineering is one of the few meta-fields where it's still relatively common that you'll stay in a job directly related to your major.  So lots of scientists are going to jobs in law, marketing, policy, consulting, data science, etc.  15-20 years ago biotech companies had trouble explaining their technology to patent lawyers in the first place; now it's common for patent lawyers to have a Ph.D and have even worked with related technologies.  You can see a similar trend occurring in policy and business related to scientific fields.  Arguably, even in engineering, you're better off salary- and promotion-wise if you move into a non-technical job (note all those programmers that are being recruited from India aren't exactly doing well even though they're in a relatively well-regarded white collar job).

I know a couple of other guys personally who studied something more artistic/liberal arts like Medieval Studies or music, but coupled it with something like math or CS.  And they both are now able to have jobs.  So yeah, bring your passion along with you, but don't have it always be your end-all be-all guide.    As for the French Literature, there are bound to be some Fortune 500 executives who studied something like that in combination with some sort of business or finance degree.  Never just by itself, but usually in combination with something that had some more pragmatic application.    I think studying something like Medieval Studies or French Literature or classical music can be beneficial because you are studying a very different culture and so get used to examining other ways of thinking, which I think leaves one more able to think critically and objectively about problems they must face be it in the work place or wherever.  Further, that all can contribute to a more successful career in areas that require soft-skills and the ability to work well with others.  Finally, studying something like that can help bring meaning to the world.  Studying other cultures, or your own culture, from a high-level view can help make sense of where one fits into this big and complex world."

People think talent means you'll instantly be good at something which is really, really not the case. You have to try and fail at it like anything else.

J K Rowling had imagination in spades (though I am no Harry Potter fan, I enjoyed the first three and didn't much like the rest).   When I see the work of writers and copywriters who are truly successful, they tend to be really talented on all fronts. The prose is there. The ideas are there. The originality is there.   I don't doubt you can shape and hone that. But to develop it from scratch if you never had it to begin with? That I doubt.

When it was my turn I started talking about minimum salary, growth expectations, work life flexibility, etc. People seemed like they were offended by my answer, and some people even argued with me that I was making a terrible choice of things to focus on.

Since that time, I've found myself much happier working even a low paying retail job. I'm back in school now in a field that I'm not super ""passionate"" about, but I love the opportunity to get an education and interact with people. My point is - changing my attitude about what I'm doing and breaking the selfish expectation that people should reward me for doing whatever I want, I find that I can enjoy just about anything, within reason. My focus nowadays on is not how can I find what's going to make me the happiest, but rather how can I contribute the most to society. In approaching it that way, I eliminate the self-centric, self-defeating expectation that there is some special ""passion"" I have that I will excel at, and I find myself better equipped to love any career path.

When it comes to earning a living and being a productive member of society – I don’t think people should limit their options to those vocations they feel passionate towards.   That's sort of where he really began to lose me. Earning a living is important. Well, necessary. Beyond that, the idea that you should strive to become a productive member of society is the same kind of vague 'follow your dreams' bullshit that this article criticizes.   Who determines what being a productive member of society is? If I'm earning a living and paying my taxes, what other 'productivity' do I owe society?  I think more and more younger people are seeking options outside of the traditional narratives, because while those narratives are still in place, the opportunities that sustained them are fast disappearing.   No, not everyone will be the next Lady Gaga, or professional athlete. But there's a lot of room between international pop star and cesspool maintenance man.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that job itself, but it's place in this article is off-putting to me. Acknowledge your lack of abilities and even if you end up as a cesspool cleaner you might find happiness! And then you die. But you were productive!  I'm not very interested in most career advice given by people 50 or older. They have absolutely no idea what it's like out there. Mike Rowe has seen a ton of jobs, but his lecture on just accepting limits comes across as advice from someone who thinks that there are tons of jobs just waiting to be filled out there if only the young folk would put aside their pride and silly dreams.   I'm not interested in working 60 hours a week for the next 40 years at a job I don't like with no pension, low benefits, constant stress, and a disconnect from any sense of purpose. I don't see that as being entitled. We get one life, I'm not going to be pushed into a form of servitude that doesn't interest me just because the people benefitting from the current system have decided it's the way things should be.   The generation before Rowe built a society of growing stability and economic opportunity. Rowe's generation has closed doors behind them, siphoned what they can from the public, reduced opportunity, reduced stability, and fundamentally shifted the economic landscape of the planet to benefit elites. So forgive me for seeing the economic patterns since Reagan and deciding that people giving this kind of sanctimonious advice have absolutely no idea what they're talking about.   I'm going to be working for the next 40 years. I'd rather fight and struggle for a job that is fulfilling or that I'm passionate about than accept my role as a drone that needs to accept the opportunities handed to me by a system that has absolutely no interest in me or my generation.   Whether tech, sustainable development, art, green energy, community activism, whatever, there's a large and growing response to the lack of opportunity the younger generation has in comparison to Rowe's.   So I'd have counter advice for him. Don't tell us to settle for ""realistic"" jobs that we have no connection to because it's required to sustain the ""productivity"" of a system that dismisses us. Your generation fucked it all up. It's our opportunity now to react to that reality in a way that we see fit. That slows the degradation of our ecosystems (kind of a big deal). That provides more opportunity for the generation after us.   People always think that the system they know is the truth, and that younger people deviating from it are somehow naïve or entitled. But they're looking at a very different timeline than we are. There's naivety, but there's also self-centered cynicism.   I'd rather spend the rest of my life fighting for something I want than settling for something I don't, especially when I've seen what that kind of defeatism does for society at large."

Secondly, while demand might drive some jobs and there is spectrum between blue collar worker and Lady GaGa (which I admit the latter is a hyperbole), it would take time for those jobs to form, and it depends on the individuals particular.

The problem with America is that people are lazy and spoiled, young people are narcissists with their eyes glues to phones, and your life is only worthwhile when you produce surplus value doing unpleasant work.  Bullshit. Why do Americans work harder, longer hours than most high income countries? Why are Americans taking the fewest vacation days in four decades? Why is wealth distribution so unequal? Do you really think it's because we are averse to getting our hands dirty?

Do you really think a ""blue collar job"" is more degrading to Americans than 55 hours a week doing peon data entry or retail jobs with a college degree?  He's giving a lazy, uncritical, conservative answer to how to organize your life in late-capitalism: subordinate your creative impulses, produce what the market dictates, don't ask too many questions about why you aren't prospering, and if you haven't killed yourself yet from misery or meaningless hard work then you too can make six-figures and prosper.   Maybe better questions: Why does our nation make so much money but our labor is worth so little? Why are we killing ourselves working 2 jobs, 3 jobs and struggling to pay rent, Healthcare costs and student loan debt? Why is wealth so concentrated? Why do people like Mike Rowe tell us we need to sacrifice our dreams, the things that make life worthwhile in pursuit of false promises of prosperity?   If we asked these questions instead, we would be able to pursue our creative interests without the pressing need to monetize every aspect of our existence. We could work our jobs for a reasonable amount of time, make a reasonable living, and still have enough of a life left over to pursue our passions and enjoy our existence.

Add on to that how much more the health care will cost for those chronic injuries.... Fuck that shit. More Skills gap bullshit when we have a compensation gap in reality."
TrueReddit,3du4xc,fullofwind,450,Sun Jul 19 20:01:50 2015 UTC,"Isn't he saying he ran from it because he sucked at it, though, not because he didn't want to do it? And that other people should be willing to explore those trades instead of just writing them off because they're not ""passionate"" about it?  I grew up thinking I was passionate about writing. The hard part was that the message I received growing up was that we had to have a passion. That we had to find out passion. My university adopted the slogan, ""Follow your passion, find your place."" The implication is that without passion, we won't have a place. And the crushing thing I eventually realized was that I didn't have a passion. There's nothing I'm super into. I enjoy reading, and playing video games, and I like my job, and I love my wife, and I look forward to starting a family, but there's no job or activity that i care so deeply about that I absolutely have to do it. There is no activity that is such a part of who and what I am that I cannot not do it. For a writer, they have to write, and I realized that I didn't. I was doing it because I thought I had to have a passion. Forcing it made me unhappy. Realizing I didn't have a passion left me lost and confused.  Eventually, I got over it, and people like Mike Rowe helped with that. I don't have to be passionate about my job. I just needed to find something I enjoy well enough that helps me do other stuff I enjoy. And overall, as a result, my life is happy and good.  I have a liberal arts degree, and I didn't read Rowe as bashing liberal arts. I read him as bashing unrealistic expectations, which certainly abound. We need to be more realistic, do the best we can, and seek contentment. I think it's out there, but too often we put ourselves in untenable situations, or beat ourselves up, because reality doesn't match what we think it ought to be."
TrueReddit,3du4xc,dmmagic,114,Mon Jul 20 06:36:10 2015 UTC,I think this is a very astute interpretation of what Rowe meant...perhaps more poignant than what he actually wrote.   I feel quite similarly to the thoughts you've shared here.

People get way too wrapped up in the specifics of the job itself, when they should focus on the whole picture of contentment. Some jobs suck but are bearably sucky and can result in more contentment then blindly following your whims. Life has compromise and people need to be able to judge those compromises away from one size fits all advice."

I have a friend who's followed his dreams to be an artist and musician.   Now he's 40.   Like 99% of musicians and artists, he never became a star, and has little to show for it. He's having a serious mid-life crisis about this.  It would have sucked a bit for him to have had to focus less on his dreams of fame and work harder at his teaching career. For sure.  It just would have sucked a lot less than this."
TrueReddit,3du4xc,NoddysShardblade,9,Sun Jul 19 18:01:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah but sometimes never trying and not knowing is a lot worse than trying and failing. I'm not a ""follow your passion"" kind of guy. I believe in a little more pragmatism and intellectual engagement than that. But I can live with honest failure. I can shrug my shoulders and move on from there. But never trying is like a cancer. It eats you from the inside."
TrueReddit,3du4xc,remedialrob,7,Sun Jul 19 20:29:20 2015 UTC,I think Rowe would advocate trying to do both.  Keep pursuing a 9-5 that you can live with and put food on the table while pursuing your art after work and on weekends until it proves to you that it's lucrative enough.  I remember reading about Type O Negative scheduling their tours around Pete Steele's vacation time because he didn't want to give up a good job working for NYC Department of Parks and Recreation.    Many famous and successful touring musicians have to maintain some sort of off stage job especially nowadays in this downloading economy.  At the very least they're diversifying into alternative revenue streams.
TrueReddit,3du4xc,MaxJohnson15,5,Sun Jul 19 22:50:34 2015 UTC,"I once knew a guy in his 60s who was in this position. He'd been playing bar gigs, and had written and sold some songs so he had some royalties from that, and he'd made a living... but now he was in his 60s and had no retirement, and his ability to make an income was dwindling. He couldn't keep playing late nights at the bars.  That's a rough place to be. Another mate of mine is in his 30s and loves to play music, but he works in IT to make money for his wife and kids, and it puts money into the retirement account. I guarantee, when he's 60, he's not going to regret missing a night or two each week at the bar because he needed to be at work the next day."

TrueReddit,3du4xc,enroxorz,10,Mon Jul 20 04:06:33 2015 UTC,Man I wish I could accept my lack of passion like you did. I feel like I am still trying to figure out what my passion is but I just can't figure it out. It makes me feel like I'm just super lazy or apathetic or something.   The thing is I did engineering in college just because I am really smart in math and physics and I was told it was the best way to guarantee a comfortable life. I've been professionally working as an engineer now for 3 years and just feel unfulfilled. I think the only reason I feel that way is because I'm not doing something I am passionate about. But then here's the kicker: I have no idea what I am passionate about. I have no idea what I am supposed to be doing. I gain relative enjoyment from my work and find it pretty interesting and also feel like I am making productive contributions to society but I just do not feel that passionate drive doing what I am doing. Am I supposed to just accept that a mediocre middle class lifestyle is what I am destined to be doing? Am I supposed to just accept that I am not passionate and just kind of nihilistic? Have I maybe just not found what I am passionate about yet.   I think the only thing I am actually passionate about is traveling. But it is extremely hard to make a living/career out of traveling. Maybe I'm just an angsty mid-twenties millennial going through a quarter life crisis. I don't know but I just feel very frustrated.
TrueReddit,3du4xc,N8_Doge,13,Mon Jul 20 01:02:42 2015 UTC,"It didn't come fast or easy. The biggest challenge was feeling guilty all the time for not doing the thing I thought I was supposed to be doing. I was a writer, right? So I ought to be writing. But I'm playing video games. And while I enjoyed playing games, it made me less happy because I felt guilty because I wasn't writing. But writing didn't make me happy either, and neither did anything else.  The problem wasn't the activity, but the mindset. It's highly personalized, but for me I finally had a breakthrough after a long period of very deliberate self-reflection. I'd do something, be it reading, or walking, or playing music, or playing games, or writing, or whatever, and after a couple of hours I'd ask myself, ""Am I happy right now?"" And I started paying attention to what made me happy and what made me unhappy.  One of my realizations was that I had unconsciously associated playing games with being a slacker. I grew up watching my dad play computer games in the early 90s, and he never held down a job and drove us into bankruptcy. My parents got divorced, and my dad screwed up my life one way after another. So whenever I gamed, I felt like a slacker and a failure. Once I realized that it was due to this association, I was able to start healing from it. And once I started logging what made me happy and unhappy, I began to figure out how to balance out my life.  A middle class lifestyle, my friend, is not mediocre. It is miles ahead of the rest of the world. Take this opportunity afforded by being middle class and pursue self-actualization. You have secure shelter, food, clothing, and the capability to try out different instruments, groups, games, foods, travels, cooking, sports, etc. Follow the old improv advice of, ""Say yes."" Within reason, of course, but don't say no to things. Go out and try stuff. And maybe you won't find one thing you absolutely love, but maybe you'll find a few things you like, and you can do those 3-4 things a little bit each week or every two weeks, and now you have a more full and varied life.  I think everyone in their mid-20s and early 30s goes through the same thing. You're not alone. If you don't have any ties to a location yet, you could pursue jobs in other countries. You could also start exploring the area around you. I only realized a couple of years ago how much cool stuff is in driving distance of where I live (southwest Missouri). There are something like 80+ wineries in Missouri. There are tons of great rivers and creeks and forests and hiking places. There are theaters and festivals all over the place through three seasons of the year. And every few years, we go overseas for a couple of weeks, but if we lived overseas, we could travel once every month or two. Engineers can find homes all over the place, so you've got lots of options. If you can't move, really look around your area. If you can, it might be worth checking out."
TrueReddit,3du4xc,dmmagic,6,Mon Jul 20 04:12:08 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the well thought out response, thanks for that. Yeah basically I am starting to try and do some of the things you said above, especially with self actualization. I've been reading a lot more, trying to meditate more, and meeting new people. I definitely get what you are saying about the guilty thing. I always feel like that if I do something that I feel is unproductive but I enjoy I just feel really guilty like I wasted my time. Like I should be learning a new programming language instead of watching True Detective or going to the bar with someone.   Actually when I graduated college I moved to a completely new city that I had never been to for a job. So I guess that counts for something? I have really enjoyed the new experiences I have had here and have pretty much explored every inch of the city at this point.   Ah anyways, I actually feel better after ranting. You're response above really made me feel better too, thanks. I'm just overthinking my situation. Maybe I should stop thinking so much and just start living and appreciating my situation. Petty first world problems I guess."

And because that end isn't something you have to do every day, you can change it at will. Your work could one day finance your foray into painting, and a month later you can drop that and take up carpentry. Your life doesn't necessarily have to have some overarching grand narrative. You don't have to have a magnum opus. You can just live life the way you enjoy it, day to day, week to week, and if at the end you can say ""Hey, that was all right"", that's good enough."

TrueReddit,3du4xc,new_weather,19,Sun Jul 19 21:24:47 2015 UTC,"I prefer 'Follow your nose' to 'Follow your passion.' Follow your passion does imply that there should be something that you absolutely love and can't imagine not doing. As you correctly observed many people do not have this. But 'Follow your Nose' basically means that you shouldn't dismiss your instincts.    Follow your Passion implies you have a passion. Its what you want to do FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE! If you actually understand what the rest of your life means, this is an impossible standard. But following your nose is about doing what interests you. The people who end up with ""passions"" didn't start with them, their nose just led them down a roughly linear path. Others might take a more winding path, that in retrospect seems wayward, but if the person arrived at that path by pursuing their shifting interests they actually did nothing differently from the 'passionate' person.    Those are examples of how you can take either a direct or indirect path in a fulfilling way. You can also take a direct or indirect path and hate yourself. If you're going to law school because ""i'm supposed to"" and you force yourself through three years of shit because someone told you its a good career you're follow the same trail as the passionate person, but you're going to hate it. Likewise you could hop from major to major, career to career looking for your 'passion' because someone told you you should have one and you end up trying everything and liking nothing."

But you can't be dispassionate. I feel all the focus on ""finding your passion"" at the college level breeds some contempt in those that haven't found theirs or just aren't inclined to have one that translates into a career.

Could be true, but it seems to be too subjective to be able to prove.    Basically, if you're a normally happy person, you'll be just as happy as a septic cleaner as you would be as a rock star.   For some reason, I'm very skeptical about this."

The wage potential will rise so that what ever sacrifice is needed to gain that skill will seem less of a sacrifice.

In one of the presidential debates in the last election, this 20 year old student (only a few years younger than me) got up and asked Romney, ""I'm an art major at [some expensive liberal arts uni].  What are you going to do to make sure I have a job when I graduate?""  I would never bash the value of a liberal arts degree, but my gut response was as follows: up until my own undergrad I was REALLY into music (guitar and singing), but knowing that the salaries that music degrees deliver are not great and would leave me a with a fair amount of debt, I opted to double major in biochemistry and neuroscience.  These were two passions of mine as well, perhaps less so than music, but interesting to me nonetheless.  I graduated from undergrad, would have had no trouble getting a job (except that I went directly to medical school), and I still play guitar and sing to this day.  So there's this kid and there's me.  I considered what I loved, considered the alternative, and considered what was the surest way to making money.  I have a lot of respect for those who have followed their dream of making music and art, but no sympathy if they are going to complain that they haven't been able to find gainful employment doing that.  I am aware that I am ignoring large parts of Mike Rowe's and your arguments.  I also know there are other ways to make money with a liberal arts degree besides the ones I mentioned.  I agree with you about the ""millions of jobs unfilled"" bullshit, etc.  I'm really just talking about this specific scenario.  Thanks."

The dude is an Opera singer who became a TV star!    Is he right?  On a personal level, yes.  The easiest way to kill your passion for something is to make it into a business.  All the sudden, you find yourself in a Walmart photo studio taking family portraits of trailer trash at $25/pop wondering WTF happened to your passion for photography.  Job satisfaction is heavily linked to your (1) coworkers/socialization, (2) variety of tasks/work, and (3) stimulation/challenge.  (There might be some other factors that I'm forgetting.)  As long as these criteria are met, people can be very happy with their work.  But...  On a societal level, Rowe is very wrong.  My family and I immigrated from Europe where Rowe's attitude is main attitude.  You know the result?  Stagnation.  Nothing happens.  Very few people are trying anything and their efforts are looked at with suspicion and predictions of failure.  Very risk averse, and it's hard to get anyone to do anything unless they are almost certain that it will work.  The beauty of the USA is the blind optimism of Americans.  People are willing to bet the farm on their ideas.  People are willing to take a few years off to pursue a dream.  You have people going back to university at 40 to get a degree in something.  It's amazing.  Failure is seen as experience - not as a black mark.  Many fail and this is a risky path for any single individual.  (which is why Rowe is right) But for the country as a whole, this is why USA keeps staying towards the top of every metric. (which is why Rowe is wrong.)"

You may have the help of a dual-income from your spouse but it'll be a huge struggle. You will likely have to move to where your career jobs exist. Oh, but you have kids now and they don't want to change schools and lose all their friends by moving three states away.   I see this every time I interview. People who are in their 40s starting fresh at a new career. Most are equally terrible at it as their last one. They complain that they can't afford to feed their family with an entry level job.

All the old welders and machinists are retiring and shops are hiring just about anyone. So why don't we have people going into it? I have some first-hand experience with this phenomenon.   The kids that can afford a school (not expense, loans take care of that, but time is a big one) tend to go to college. Anyone that's even slightly academically inclined feels as though they need to go to college. I worked as a tutor for a bunch of DeVry students. I ended up convincing half of them to switch to community or state school (they had no idea that the colleges were better!) or switching into a trade school. The trade school was a tough sell. It was viewed as lesser than college. No one believed me when I'd tell them the starting rate. But some people are gifted with their hands, and can make a lot of money with them. It all boiled down to the perception of trade school being a lesser path than college.   In high school, no one tells you to go to trade school. Everyone tells you to go to college. And the very poor, the guys working three jobs who'd probably gladly go to trade school at this point, are generally supporting a family member or need the immediate income and can't take the time off to afford school. I went to night school to become a C.N.A. - just about every single person there was supporting a family and trying to better themselves for that family. And although CNAs are in high demand, we still had a low class number. Not everyone with a family can have the luxury of going to school. And the younger generation is so misinformed that they end up at a fake place like DeVry buried in student loan debt.   So yeah, you can have high-paying jobs, but convincing the newer generation to take those jobs while they still lack a family can be a really tough sell, and those with a family don't have the luxury of time or money to go get those jobs."

The primary reason that these jobs pay well (among other benefits) is that employers can't just fill the jobs the next day (or in a week). As soon as the employers get more of the power back, it'll be just another job where employers have workers over a barrel.  Most people aren't pursuing what they love. They've never even figured out what they love. They have never had a chance because they need to survive. They're working retail or working as insurance agents or working at car dealerships or working at restaurants or working as low paid office workers for some random company.

If you follow your absolute passion, many discover that it isn't what they expected it to be, become jaded, and take a long time to recover. But when someone ""arranges"" a marriage to a career for its sensible benefits, they often slowly learn to love it. In the case of careers more so than relationships, you can enjoy some parts of almost any job and then use that to slowly find your way to something you are truly passionate about.  But, like in relationships, a lot of people end up staying with a job they dislike but is convenient, hampering their own growth and leading to decades of regret. Since it often seems like this was the experience of many of the baby boomers, I think this has led to the ""follow your dream"" mentality that was fed to millennials, who will in turn probably tell their kids to just find a steady job and stick with it."

After that I had an interview with LG through my school, and that led to a job testing cell phones for LG. After that contract was up I now work at Qualcomm as a software engineer for cell phones.   In high school I applied to two places: SDSU and an acting college in New York. I was accepted to both and I chose to follow my passion (at the time) to New York. After 2 years and a lot of formal training, I discovered I didn't have the stomach for the networking and politics behind the scenes. I still enjoyed acting and when I came back home I tried to get some traction on it, but after a few months I went back to a real college to get a real degree.  When I went back I picked my major as math, since that was going to be my original major, only to find whatever talent I had in that had atrophied with my time not studying it daily in New York. It took me another 7 years to finally graduate, from ITT Tech, with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. Nearly 9 years after I had decided to follow my dream.

We need people doing things that people need getting done. PAs, engineers, etc. Learn how to learn, work hard and make the sacrifices necessary to be useful to society. I've never felt that loving what I do was as important as having a purpose in society but maybe I'm in the minority.  The other aspect is that I think our generation, the milennials, need to recognize that we can't have the same material expectations of the baby boomers.

I don't know what the implications are if others follow my lead for the greater economy however.  On a side note: f*** the baby boomers. I do blame them. We, wrongfully, used their playbook when it no longer served. But they really have no right to judge us. They would not have done so well in this environment either."

TrueReddit,3du4xc,remedialrob,3,Sun Jul 19 16:18:30 2015 UTC,"There are literally hundreds of thousands of pilots in America that are passionate about flying, AOPA (Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association) has ~400k members. These are people that love flying and in my experience, are extremely passionate about it.   BLS says there are ~100k Airline and Commercial pilot jobs in the US (as of 2012). There is such a disconnect simply because there aren't enough pilot jobs to go around so entry-level regional airline pilots make a shit wage with shit hours. Some others fly for small airlines in Africa or Central America, trading safety for hours behind the stick. Not everybody can live out of a suitcase for years while barely scraping by before they (possibly) break into the majors and land a good job as a bus driver in the sky.  So instead, most pilots fund their passion with other jobs from all walks of life. Some are student pilots who pay for lessons when they can afford it, professionals who buy an old Cessna to fly their families for a $100 cheeseburger, etc.   These are people that followed their passion, but pragmatically found other ways to fund it. I have my own plan to finance my love of flying because I have to be realistic about it.

Mike is more right in some ways because he points out the necessity of evaluating the person. ""Follow Your Passion"" isn't for everyone. And giving that advice on a mass scale is no more flawed than the opposite idea of not following your passion. The truth is that what you do is only applicable to you. Every one of us is a snowflake. And so there is no one size fits all life philosophy.   That said Mike is also off on the whole ""millions of jobs going unfilled"" nonsense. There was a time when trades cultivated their members. Apprenticeship and work study programs are a thing of the past right long with the unions that kept them going. The reason that many of those jobs that go unfilled (and I would argue that ""millions"" is very hyperbolic) remain unfilled because they don't offer the training, job security, benefits and even pay that a  trade job offered thirty years ago. And that doing the kind of work that takes years to master for lousy pay and lousier benefits isn't a job worth filling.   And the people offering these made up jobs know this. And have no problem leaving them unfilled. If they really needed the workers... they would offer better compensation."

A few years ago, I encouraged him to think about alternatives to the 9-5 office job.  ""Think about a trade like plumbing.  You can go get a 2-year business degree, then learn a trade.  You will start at the bottom and for a few years you will be doing some dirty jobs.  Then when you know what you are doing, you can start your own business.  Once you build a reputation, you can hire people to work for you, and that's when you will begin to be wealthy.  In your forties, you can go to work in the mornings and play golf in the afternoons if you want, but if you have done it right you won't be getting your hands dirty anymore.  You will have a job that can't be outsourced overseas, and the only way to ""lose your job"" is if you are incompetent or dishonest, and I don't think you are capable of either.  You will not only work for yourself - a great freedom - but will be providing jobs for others.""

However, the ability to recognize your own limitations as Mike says and decide that your passion might make a better hobby than a career can be so beneficial to your health and prosperity.  I did theater in high school, and come senior year, I had to fight not to cringe when some people told me they were going to a theater school for college and that they were going to make this their career because they loved it so much. It was so clear to me that they were going to waste their money, time, and life on a 4 year acting degree that would lead them nowhere but to waiting tables and community theaters across the nation.   I wish those people could have realized they weren't going to be on Broadway, and had instead gotten a degree in something they excel at. They could still always be in the exact same community theater shows they would have been in anyway, but as a hobby and with a real job that allows them to live comfortably."

TrueReddit,3du4xc,kushmuir,2,Sun Jul 19 15:44:37 2015 UTC,"To me, the entire concept of work as your ""life's passion"" is utter nonsense.  There's literally NOTHING that I want to do 40+ hours a week, every week for the next 30-40 years.  I love to play guitar and write music, but I know I'm not good enough at it to make a living.  Even if I somehow could sustain my lifestyle doing it, I'm pretty sure the ""passion"" would suddenly disappear as soon as I ""had"" to do it.  I once went on a guided fishing trip and it was just myself and one other guest on the small boat with the guide, so we talked a lot.  He gets outfitted by his employer, new boat of his choice every 2 years, any and all gear he wants.  Pretty much any time he needs something, he's got carte blance at Bass Pro Shop, plus he gets paid to go fishing.  Sounds like heaven, right?  Not for him.  He said as soon as he had enough money saved up, he was going to throw all his gear in the boat, set it on fire and never fish again.  To me, the entire problem is the message that you're supposed to live through your work or make your career your life's purpose.   That may work for some people, but it really doesn't resonate with me.  I hate to make broad sweeping generalizations about previous generations, because there are always plenty of exceptions, but it seems that the Baby Boomer generation was far more likely to live this way than younger people.  I know my Dad is still working at age 67, even though he doesn't have to because he just doesn't know what else to do.  He doesn't have hobbies, he doesn't have anything else on his bucket list.  He just works because that's what he does.  I don't know that it's his ""passion"", whatever that means.  Life is what you make it.  Find purpose in what resonates with you.  If that's through your work, great.  If it's through your hobbies, great.  If it's raising the best damn kids you possibly can, great.  If it's doing charity work, great.  If it's something different every few years, great.  So while I agree with Mike Rowe to some extent, because the corporate motivational poster is just a hollow platitude, I disagree that people shouldn't follow their passion.  Just don't expect your passion to necessarily be your career."

I think it's reasonable to say that the advances in geology, astronomy, and biology since then have rendered the literal interpretation of Genesis to be incompatible with science. But the problems don't end there - the modern physics, chemistry, and biology present similar problems for miracles, and neuroscience makes the whole idea of a soul pretty doubtful.  So where does that leave scientifically literate Christians? I do find it a bit puzzling that so many of them are willing to accommodate science when it comes to Genesis but not, say, the Gospels.

I'm not a Christian myself, but most of the scientifically literate ones I've encountered prefer the idea of ""God, The Watchmaker"" where all scientifically understood processes are just mechanisms created by God.  Most of the time, God lets these mechanisms run on their own while he's off doing god-knows-what, but occasionally he'll bypass the scientific mechanism and directly intervene with a miracle.  Not all Christians are strict biblical literalists (in fact, I'd say that the vast majority are willing to accept that it's full of misinterpretations, myths and mistranslations) so it's pretty easy for them to disregard things like Genesis or Noah's flood."

He added that states can have a universal background check law without him feeling infringed upon.  As both a gun owner and prior service Abn Infantryman, I completely agree with Mr. Metcalf.   Owning a firearm automatically comes with responsibilities. Pro-level training matters especially when utilized in self defense. The idea of unregulated/zero-training requirement, legal concealed carry makes me extremely nervous from a public safety point of view.   Mandatory firearms training forces you to think about the power you have within your hands and the potential reprcussions when you pull the trigger. A lack of mandatory training leaves a hodgepodge of holes when it comes to basic firearm safety and people carring guns on a daily basis. This is why the military has such stringent weapon training standards. Ie, force everyone to go through a basic-level of training and thus reduce accidents with guns.

Quite some time ago, schools had target ranges, trap shooting teams, and other things of that nature.  Children were raised in a world where things like having a gun in your locker weren't out of the ordinary, gun racks were common, and the sight of a firearm wasn't an immediate cause for a concern.  Obviously, this is no longer the case.  Sure, some of them are on the upswing again, but thats limited to rural areas.  In quite a few places (NYC, Boston, Chicago, 99% of California) guns are so vilified that bringing them up will get you a swift ""why do you own that THING.""  Anyway...  Then the 60s happened.  Since then, the conversation that we're supposedly not having keeps changing.  (Yes, I'm not going into the NFA of 1934 act, because it had less of an impact on society overall)  It went from ""guns are too easy to buy and sell"" which banned importation of many at-the-time common firearms, to an awkward sort of compromise that kept people who were driving from state to state from getting arrested in transit in exchange for a ban on new manufacture of automatic weapons.  Both of those two acts set up a lot of the laws that are in place today, including the need to go through someone who is federally licensed to sell new firearms, criminal prohibition, and a ban on ownership by those adjudicated as being ""mentally defective.""    Since then, it's been a long series of ""compromises,"" none of which actually gave anything back to the firearms owning community, and most of the laws passed aren't used or enforced.  Most of the laws that people are asking for ALREADY EXIST.  Feel like trying to buy a gun?  You're a felon?  Don't worry, they won't prosecute, and odds are, the NICS system won't process you in time even if you have a felony.  You're a dirty gun dealer that sells pistols for cash out of the back door?  Again, you're probably fine.  Maybe, just maybe, let's actually enforce those laws already on the books meant to impact illegal trafficking.  I doubt anyone would ever argue that trafficking isn't the source of a lot of the crime.  They're already on the books.  No court sessions, no congressional lock-ups, no grandstanding.    So.... what else are we supposed to be talking about?  People who don't like guns are vocally demanding that something must be done.  You, yourself are mentioning additional restrictions, but what are those restrictions, and are you positive that those laws aren't already on the books?  No purchases on Sundays?

It's easy for people to demand mandatory training when they're not the ones who will brunt the cost.  Then there's a complete misconception of laws. People think that fully automatic firearms are readily available, that there's some sort of gun show loophole, or that magazine restrictions accomplish anything.  Want mandatory training before pistol purchases? Maybe let's repeal some worthless restrictions on SBRs and suppressors. Want yearly renewals on concealed carry permits?

The Utah permit process could be a decent model.  It's long, boring, and ultimately a waste of time if you have any amount of common sense, but it's also the most thorough.    Almost every state has conceal carry laws already, and not all of them (read: most don't) mandate training.  There.  Compromise.  See?  I'm not even asking for across-the-board constitutional carry.

TrueReddit,3dxuet,Quouar,6,Mon Jul 20 12:42:20 2015 UTC,"From my perspective of having studied linguistics, the most blatant difference in capability is skirted in this article, and not mentioned in the companion article.  That difference is that humans have a generative grammar.  While other animals have shown a capacity to use and understand words, they have never shown a generative grammar.  A very simple pre-linguistic communication capability might look something like this: adjective noun verb  So from that you can get things like ""red apple"", ""apple eat"", ""two apples take"", and so on. That's valuable communication! But its not language.  Why not? Because it lacks a generative grammar. You can put different symbols into the template of slots, but you can't alter the template. Perhaps you could even have a set of templates, like: Noun verb noun Adjective noun Adverb verb  And so on. But that can't come close to human language. In language, we can have whole structures (clauses, or what we would call phrase nodes in syntax) stand in for each word position. And those in turn can have an element replaced by a more complex one.  We can encounter not only a novel sentence, but even a whole novel syntactic tree and parse it to understand the meaning of each phrase, and then the meaning of the whole. The syntactic trees can be of arbitrary complexity, although we do have processing limits.  No other animal has demonstrated anything like this ability, and it's what allows us to communicate ideas of arbitrary complexity.  It is, indeed, a difference of kind rather than mere degree. Once developing children get past ""telegraphic speech"" (the sort that other animals can manage) and engage their generative grammar, they are very quickly capable of producing sentences of arbitrary complexity. A switch turns on, and our language ability goes from 5mph to supersonic. We don't simply acquire one new syntactic pattern at a time, as we would if this difference were a matter of degree.  Generative grammar is an ability that immediately gives us access to unlimited complexity in speech."

The fact that some animals exhibit some level of linguistic ability does not mean that any of them are going to produce a Shakespeare or a Pushkin or even a Dan Brown. Human language is orders of magnitude more complex than what even the ""smartest"" apes like Koko and Kanzi managed - quite aside from the fact that the average native speaker of English has a vocabulary of 20,000-35,000 words (compared to Kanzi's 500), things like grammar and syntax elude apes. The average human four-year-old has a vocabulary ten times the size of Kanzi's.  So yeah.

TrueReddit,3dvdh0,klcoupe,30,Sun Jul 19 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"No submission statement. Here at TrueReddit, you are expected to start off the discussion, and add some background about why the article is worth reading. You may also wish to link to the original study, for those readers who want it raw. The article makes a false dichotomy. What if there is a genetic basis for risk-taking behavior, and rich families are those that took risk in the past? Then most entrepreneurs would come from money, be of above-average intelligence (their parents were successful risk-takers), and probably have histories of risk-taking behavior as children -- which is exactly what was found in the original study. To quote: ""The combination of ""smart"" and ""illicit"" tendencies as youths accounts for both entry into entrepreneurship and the comparative earnings of entrepreneurs."" In this scenario, some class dichotomy is to be expected (only successful risk-takers have the resources to make familes), but stronger punishments for low-class risk-taking children would exacerbate class divisions. So there are two policy options if the goal is to maximize social mobility: be more forgiving of risk-taking low-class children, or treat all children equally (in either case, eliminate ""affluenza"").  The study focuses on ""incorporated individuals"", whose businesses ""demand comparatively strong nonroutine cognitive abilities"". Why did they do this? What about unincorporated business owners, who still run risky but rewarding businesses? Perhaps they were trying to eliminate self-employed laborers, like taxi drivers, but it seems like there is a chance their sample is deliberately excluding minority or immigrant entrepreneurs in low-capital industries. So to summarize, the linked study makes a strong circumstantial case that entrepreneurship is a result of genes and environment, and the linked article mis-interprets this a little bit to focus on the environmental inequalities. On the other hand, the study may be ignoring the larger subset of low-capital new business owners, and it is quite possible that they bias their result by doing so.   tl;dr: Got sucked into arguing with clickbait title; read actual study; article was emphasizing environmental factors over interaction between genetics and environment; I now understand some of the reasoning behind ""social justice""."

TrueReddit,3dwo0t,libreg,3,Mon Jul 20 03:51:50 2015 UTC,"Future generations will mock the current tendency to view neuroscience as the final arbiter of value and significance, as though nothing were real unless it had been confirmed by neuroscience.   By this I don't mean to say that neuroscience as a field of study is useless or necessarily flawed, but the role neuroscience tends to be given in relation to understanding our subjective experiences as well as in providing grounds for evaluating other fields of study is ridiculous and unwarranted.  I could give several different arguments here, but I'm going to with Hegel's critique of Physiognomy. Physiognomy was motivated and adopted by certain interpreters of science in a similar way to the contemporary use of neuroscience, in that it attempted to derive personality from close observation of the face.   Hegel's critique (adapted for the present case by altering section 312 of the Phenomenology of Mind) is this: We can just as well say that particular mental processes express the inner reality of their meaning too much to leave room for reinterpretation by neuroscience as we can say that they express them too little. Too much because the reality of a mental process already breaks out in the original activity of undergoing that process in the mind, so that no opposition remains between this process and its inner reality. The mental process does not merely provide an expression of the inner reality, it immediately provides the inner reality itself.  Too little because in the speech and action by which the inner mental process is observable, it is brought into a world where the meaning of that process is socially mediated, and thereby abandons itself to the mercy of the element of transformation, which twists the spoken word and the accomplished deed and makes something else out of them than what they, as the actions of the original individual, are in and for themselves. By way of this external influence which is exerted by others, identical actions may have varied meanings and effects on others.  So that if we limit our understanding of the meaning of an act to the individual then neuroscience can provide no input on the interpretation of that act which was not already known, but if we open our understanding of the meaning of an act to its social impact then the picture given by neuroscience is necessarily incomplete and can likewise provide no insight."

So while militaries control territory, the question of ""who do they control that territory for?"" inevitably leads back to the people with the money to support a military. Those who command the economy control the society. It's not right, and it probably isn't the best way to do things, but in our present society, the financiers run the world, by deciding who gets access to credit.

Credit is even more abstract than that - it's the creation of government-sanctioned money through government-mandated institutions. Most of it never even takes physical form, it just has the implicit (or explicit, in the case of crisis) backing of the issuing nations.  This is why governments ultimately side with lenders, because they're the biggest lenders of all. When the banks make stupid loans, it does ultimately reflect on the governments that created them, because the central bank loaned that money to the commercial bank.  Interest rates are supposed to be the borrower's share of the lender's risk plus profit.   Make one bad loan? ""Well, that's the business for ya!""  Make billions of dollars in bad loans? Well that's a systemic crisis that says the government's regulators are idiots, corrupt, or completely asleep at the switch because they keep encouraging the reckless lending habits of financial executives who can't appropriately measure the amount of risk they're creating."

TrueReddit,3dvho5,am3r,3,Sun Jul 19 21:36:16 2015 UTC,"I think this is connected to the veto by Russia of the UN ruling, iirc the Russians vetoed the ruling because of a clause introduced by the UK   Also I agree about the various conspiracy theories but I thought this was also a bit shady   Meanwhile, Serbs insist they have been the victims of the court. They assailed the tribunal for ultimately acquitting Naser Oric, commander of Bosnian Muslim forces in Srebrenica, though they say he is responsible for many deaths. “How many Serbs need to be killed for people in the world to see that Serbs are people, not animals?” asked Rakic, the store owner, who said his uncle was one of Oric’s victims. “Animals have rights but not the Serb people?”  International war-crimes investigators, however, say there is no proportionality in the deaths in Srebrenica or Bosnia as a whole. The say several hundred Serbs died in the fighting around Srebrenica, but the vast majority of them were Serb military forces. Across the country, Bosnian Muslims made up 65 percent of the war dead and Serbs 23 percent, according to prosecutors. Yet Bosnian Muslims made up 44 percent of the population, according to a census conducted two years before the war. Serbs made up 31 percent.  Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb news accounts lay out a different narrative. They report that 1,300 Serb civilians died around Srebrenica, and a total of 3,267 Serbs were “murdered” across eastern Bosnia.   I used to be quite interested in the debate around this and remember a book reviewing the history of the conflict called ""Confronting the Yugoslav Controversies: A Scholars' Initiative"" edited by bigtime  scholars, Charles Ingrao and Thomas A. Emmert, the bit on the verdict on Oric was interesting. Here's a link to the whole book   Local bosniak armed forces captured the village of Dravica and surrounding areas, committing massacres, looting and destroying houses, The prosecutor charged that Bosniak armed units engaged in various military operations against Bosian Serb forces during the period from may 1992 to February 1993, in the course of which ""bosniak armed units in the municipalities of bratunac, srebrenica and skelani, burnt and otherwise destroyed a minimum of fifty predominantly serb villages and hamlets. As a result thousands of Serb individuals fled the area"" Commander naser oric was found guilty in 2006 because he failed to take the necessary measures to prevent murder and cruel treatment in a number of instances. But on july 3 2008 the appeals chamber reversed the judgement and found him not guilty because it could not be proved that he had effective control over the military police that committed these crimes. Like the trial chamber the Appeals chamber also underscored that it ""had no doubt that grave crimes were committed against Serbs detained in Srebrenica...Also the defence did not challenge that crimes were committed against Serb detainees"" Last but not least there is evidence that serbs were also victimized on a larger scale in the territories held by Bosniak and croat forces. According to the...UNHCR estimates, the serb population fell between 1991 and mid 1994 from 43,595 to 5,000 in Western Herzegovina' from 79355 to 20,000 in the Zenica region; from 82,235 to 23,000 in the Tuzla area; and from 29,398 to 1,609 in the Bihac region.    I agree that the deaths are clearly not proportional and  it's also clear that many more Bosnian Muslims were killed in the conflict and the Bosnian Serbs did most of the killing. But I think that the paragraph from the author up there is sort of implying that Oric didn't commit any crimes, when from the book it kind of seems like Oric was acquitted on what seems like the lack of evidence of organisation of his forces (because of their informality), and this seems like a bit of a technicality to me.   I am not saying that the Serb/Bosnian-Serb violence wasn't far worse and  agree that the Bosnian forces crimes were less widespread and less severe in terms of murder (organisation of that) and destruction, but they obviously seem similar in character some of the time and it looks like similar ethnic cleansing going on generally on all sides, with the Serbs being the worst perpetrators and much more extreme in killing and violence generally (at least in the Bosnian conflict). I think that it's plausible that the school of thought that the author represents is kind of going too far the other way from the people emphasising serb suffering and downplaying Bosnian, painting this as a black and white, good and evil picture when it's at least slightly more ambiguous than that."
TrueReddit,3dvho5,lurker093287h,2,Mon Jul 20 14:15:05 2015 UTC,"Great post and great book.  I agree with you: I think only a blind ultra-nationalist Bosniak would deny that crimes were also committed by Bosniaks during the war. Of course they weren't proportional to the violence committed by the Serbs nor were they organized/premeditated (no one has ever accused the Bosnian army of anything even remotely resembling genocide), but I think it is important to recognize that war crimes can be committed in a war of self-defense, a point many Bosniaks don't concede.  With that said, it's always been the position of Bosniaks that anyone accused of war crimes can and should be extradited to the Hague. I don't think you can level an accusation that Bosniaks haven't complied with international courts -- they have done so fully.  As for the Naser Oric case, he was acquitted of war crimes. Whether you or I think it was on a technicality, the fact of the matter remains that the prosecution couldn't procure evidence that showed command responsibility. Like in any court, if you don't have evidence, you can't convict.   I think a big component here was also the fact that the Republic of Srpska banned journalists and media from it's territory during the war, an attempt to hide large scale war crimes and ethnic cleansing. They did this immediately after footage from the assault on Bijeljina in 1992 went out to the world and images like this emerged. Banning the media worked well for their own propaganda -- the Serbs could essentially make up any number of casualties, but there wasn't a way to independently verify anything. That same approach, however, made it virtually impossible for Serbs to produce independently verified evidence of crimes that it now accuses Bosniak forces of.  Ultimately, no war is fully black and white. With that said, for Bosnians, this was a war of survival and of the right to exist as a people. For the Milosevic regime, it was a land grab designed at creating a ""Greater Serbia."" For Croatia, it was an opportunity to expand its newly created state and they collaborated with the aggressors to achieve their goals in the now infamous Karađorđevo agreement. The Serbs almost succeeded in their aims, at one point controlling almost 80% of the territory and expelling nearly 2 million people out of a population of 4 million."

Your opinion isn't really relevant here.  Secondly, the definition of genocide is much more complex than what you make it out to be. Without getting into to much legal jargon, the accepted definition of genocide includes the wording ""in whole or in part."" Another key thing is intent.   Srebrenica is most definitely a genocide as defined under international law. Just answer these questions:   Were victims targeted for identity outside of their control? Yes, ethnic identity. Were victims murdered systematically? Yes; premeditated murder, organized, lists of intellectuals, organized burial and re-burial in mass grave sites, systematic rape of female victims, etc.) Was there intent to destroy, in whole or part, a culture from a given territory? Yes, 600 years of culture was effectively erased (i.e cultural and religious institutions and the entire Bosniak population of Eastern Bosnia were murdered or expelled).   The list goes on and on. Moreover, the ruling is generally actually viewed as too narrow, since genocide against Bosniaks likely occurred throughout the entire country, and not just in Srebrenica. There are numerous examples, but they range from all Muslims in Prijedor having to wear white armbands and then being rounded up and executed (5,000+ killed just in the vicinity of Prijedor) to extermination in concentration camps like Omarska, to the targeting of cultural institutions (why target libraries with incendiary grenades?) and religious institutions (over 1000+ mosques destroyed).  Ultimately, genocide is not about numbers. You can't compare every genocide to, say, the Holocaust, as that genocide was so extreme that even new word had to be created to describe it.

Banks are still going to rush to give poor kids loans for STEM degrees.  But, they'd be batshit crazy to give anyone 250K for an English degree unless it is guaranteed by somebody (either government or the family/student).  The problem right now is we treat all educations equally.  But favoring some fields over others solves so many problems.  It will cut down on enrollment in overcrowded majors, cut down on students who can't pay back loans, get more students into the fields that are hungry for more workers, and (theoretically) cut down on tuition.  Also - as a complete aside, students do have choices.  In state public tuition is already quite cheap (relatively speaking), with all sorts of in state scholarships and public money available.  There's absolutely no reason why the taxpayers need to be backing kids getting a 250K education at a private school.  Thus there's another middle ground here where federal loan money can only be used at in state schools."

Outside of the for-profit sector, which the government is seriously cracking down on lately, you'd be hard-pressed to find a $250K undergraduate program. Whether for good or for bad, pricing for higher education has become like pricing for medical services: institutions are incentivized to throw around artificially high prices but are quite happy to cut nearly everyone a deal to bring things down to ""normal people"" costs.  $250K education bills are so far off the norm that it's not even worth mentioning."

While some like the Ivies have stellar financial aid and dole out need-based aid like candy, others like my alma mater are notoriously stingy with aid. I know people who graduated six figures in debt, and I certainly would have if it wasn't for my incredibly gracious parents. (I graduated with five figures in debt in my own name and insist to my parents that I pay this portion myself.)  I think the current loan system perpetuates an environment where these private institutions are able to pump up their sticker prices because they know they'll get the money. It's far more rampant at the top schools than it is at your run of the mill state schools, and I don't think that's fair to disadvantaged smart kids. There are many many people far more intelligent and capable than I am who are locked out of a top education due to cost. I support initiatives for fully taxpayer-funded state schools, but I don't know a solution to this that could reasonably apply to private institutions.

In actuality, the biggest factor in tuition increases is a loss in public funding of tuition, particularly at the state level. I'm on mobile so I can't link but the percentage of tuition subsidized by public funding has dropped precipitously since the seventies and loans have been expanded to take up the slack. When boomers talk about how college was affordable back in the day, it's because states used to foot the bill.

I was just pointing out to homeworld that they can be refinanced, and that more players are entering the market every year because there is an insane amount of money held up in loans that cannot be discharged currently sitting at ridiculous interest rates.   Seriously, 9.5% variable (which, to be fair, is essentially the legal cap so even if interest rates skyrocketed it wouldn't go up much) on a $40,000 loan virtually immune from discharge held by someone with an 800 credit score and 5 years of on time payments cosigned by a 60 year old home owner who also has a great-to-excellent credit score and Navient/Sallie Mae still wouldn't consider lowering the rates? They deserved to lose my business.   I went with variable because it made sense for me, but I could have easily gone fixed and still almost halve my interest rate. Anyway, depending on how long you have left for repayment it may or may not be worth the hassle. For me, I had 10 years left and dropped it to 7.5 while keeping my payments the same. I've got a recurring reminder on my calender to check the LIBOR outlook so I can switch it to fixed if it ever makes sense to do so.   tl;dr - Know your options, they exist.

TrueReddit,3dsc3e,almostsharona,7,Sun Jul 19 18:59:40 2015 UTC,"This article gives me hope that sometimes powerful people are using said power to make the bigger picture of life better.   With regards to your questions, yes, I think the threshold should be lowered. I also think that they should be discharged during many bankruptcy proceedings, for past loans, and the government should stop backing loans to attend most if not all for-profit universities. I know that President Obama has begun pushing for greater scrutiny on these for-profit universities, which I applaud. But I think we have to recognize these private lenders, making extremely foolish loans simply because they knew the government would act as their ""heavy"" in bankruptcy settlements, were being absolutely predatory and abusing the system in this symbiotic relationship with the assholes over at the for-profit colleges.   Plus, these lenders and ""colleges"" prey on young people from the lower classes, tempting them with quick loans and the insistence that they can get their graduates jobs - pretty much guaranteed. People see this as a way out of the cycle of poverty. And like payday loans, they always seem to find a way to weasel themselves into the working-class neighborhoods.   Essentially, yes, there are lots of these loans out there, but the lenders knew what they were doing when they pulled this shitty move, so I don't feel bad for them.   The bigger issue is that we have sold young people the lie that a B.A. = guaranteed entry into or maintenance of the middle class. We have failed to adjust our schooling for the current economy. Can we all agree that a person who wishes to be a secretary or data-entry office worker or whatever probably only needs an A.A.? Because seriously, I am all for education, but we need to allow some people to make a securely middle-class living with high school diplomas or A.A.s and reserve B.A.s and higher for people who have a drive to be educated. Increase the number of government-funded programs for careers. Shit, give more students the chance to train for skilled labor and white collar jobs in high school."
TrueReddit,3dsc3e,yLSxTKOYYm,2,Sun Jul 19 10:09:47 2015 UTC,"We have failed to adjust our schooling for the current economy.   I have two ways of interpreting this. Either, as you said, we failed to adjust our schooling to meet current realities (i.e., if most jobs require college education, why not cover that material in high school instead?). Or, the economy has adjusted to inflated schooling (i.e., a degree is a quick and easy filter, regardless of whether it's needed or not).  I don't know which one is closer to reality."

It's ridiculous to assume that all art, or by extension humanities degrees, are just a drain on the economy. The mentality that you have to be trained to perform a specific repetitive task in order to be qualified for a job is what devalues these degrees, not something inherent in the subject matter itself. We should be thinking about how to employ a well-educated population instead of stepping on each other to get the most scraps that have fallen down to us."

TrueReddit,3dsc3e,DTMickeyB,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:16:53 2015 UTC,"Nice straw man fallacy, retard. With business loans, your interest rates are based on risk, your risk is based on market factors and such, as determined by economists. Same with auto loans and mortgages,  your interest is based on risk, your risk is based on credit score, and the collateral value of the car or home, how likely they are to retain their value, etc...  Now for determining the risk associated with a certain degree, you simply look at the statistics associated with people who holds those degrees. In doing so, you'll see an engineer is a lower risk investment than an art history major. The engineer should not have to pay the same interest as an art history major, just as home owner buying a home in an area with sky rocketing values shouldn't have as high an interest rate as somebody buying a home in an area with plummeting values.

Hence you call straw man when I point out that when we talk about economics and education we are talking about people and not things. We are talking about people with wildly different capabilities, support, and preparation. There are real lives behind degrees, loans, and bank accounts. You accuse me of being a kid and a retard (I am neither) but you don't seem to notice the privilege behind your attitude ( preparation and support for studying engineering, that you should have benefits not available to others because you were in a position to succeed, that your perspective is on the winning side of a clear right/wrong worldview).

Some people actually use this as justification for some people being ""good"" or useful and others as worthless or uncomprehending. That is a dangerous way to think and it happens more and more every day in the US. These kinds of issues drive a wedge between citizens and is actually a powerful political tool (competing with your brother rather than lifting each other up). Just think about the kind of world that you want to live in (especially in the case that things stop going your way) and how your decisions shape that future.

Classical is actually the name for one period within the development of what we call Classical music. Metal goes through various sub genres and styles (even if the fashion doesn't change much). Electronic or dance music consistenly evolves into things like Jungle, Drum and Bass, Trance, Dubstep etc. Rock was prone toward evolution early on, only Hip-hop evolves relatively little.  I think that some musical forms appeal to conservative tastes. People who's cultural exploration stays within the confines of acceptable for their peer group. I consider these to be heirloom genres. Each new generations believes that it's contemporary music is different to and better than that ""old stuff"" and the older generation believes that the ""new stuff"" is rubbish. The music is objectively identical, the only distinction is the generational context.  In the case of hip-hop I think this is because its become the cultural context for self-concious credibility.

I hate this - I hate the whole ""we'll focus more on your imperfections than on how well you did"". I mean, I don't need a fucking ribbon for tying my shoes, but as the saying goes - if you don't have something nice to say...  I honestly had a tipping point in high school. Our report cards were mailed home (because I went to a shithole school and we couldn't be trusted to walk them home) so we didn't know our grades before our parents. Which was pretty pointless, because 90% of the parents didn't give a shit, but whatever. So one day I walk home and have my dad shove my report card in my face and he says ""look at this"" - A, A, B, A, A-.   I said ""hey that looks pretty good!"" I was actually flattered, I prided myself on good grades, and I felt I did a good job. Fuck was I wrong. No, instead I get a lecture about how 'maybe we need to take away some of your privileges'. (Mind you, I drove a granny car, went to a school I hated, had to be home by 9, and overall my only goal in life was to leave this place.)  At that point, all I could think was ""Fuck this. Fuck all of this. Fuck you, fuck mom, fuck school, fuck everything. I don't fucking care. I work my ass off, and a B is too much. Fuck it."" And I swear, it carried through. I have a master's degree in physics, and I still have a hard time not giving up and saying ""Fuck it"" when someone pulls shit like that.  Sorry, it's a bit melodramatic perhaps, but I think the sentiment is a serious one. Don't belittle someone who's put in the effort.

TrueReddit,3dr6kk,NicholasCajun,33,Sat Jul 18 20:09:09 2015 UTC,"We are only human. Each and every one of us is fallible. There are studies that show that willpower is basically a muscle - if we use some of it here, we are less able to resist something else.  A single mother that works herself to the bone may not find it in herself to resist her child's cry for fast food. A few dollars can buy her respite. Refusing to cave just means her child cries and possibly goes to bed hungry, which makes even more stress for the mother. She might say to herself it's just this one time, but that one time becomes more and more frequent, and before she knows it her child is fat. But the willpower to free her child of obesity just isn't there. She already spends it all just to provide a roof for her kid. She just isn't strong enough to do it. And we can't solve childhood obesity by telling parents to have an iron will. It's like telling teens to just not have sex.  Everyone likes to imagine themselves as immune to advertising. We all imagine ourselves as special, when collectively we are not. You are traffic, I am not. Bad things happen to other people, not me, I don't need to buy insurance. You are a faceless internet commenter, I am a unique, fully realized person. So on and so forth.  Advertising wouldn't exist as an industry if most of us weren't susceptible to it. As authoritarian as it sounds, we sometimes need protection from ourselves. Imagine if you had a way to ""hack"" the human brain - would you simply tell people to resist the hack and that they should accept that people will try to hack them dozens of times on a daily basis? Or would you want people to stop trying to hack others?  Advertising is that brain hacking. Sometimes it's for good. But most of the time it just tells us to buy crap we don't need, and it's stuff that may even be actively bad for us."

Also more attractive =/= more effective.  Marketing and the psychology/sociology that goes along with it is a fairly complex field. A lot of money is dumped into advertising and I think we can both agree that it's not going to happen unless its effective and creating a return.

My generation (GenX) was all about information. With this generation, there is much too much information and it's about getting people's attention.   That's how we've ended up with things like Buzzfeed, that everyone supposedly hates, but consistently drives traffic. The more our attention is focused through the use of emotion, the more addicted we become to having our emotions jolted. Whether it's the awww kitty video or the hate toward (this week) Confederate flag flyers, (last week) gay bigots, (last year) Ebola quarantine avoiders...we need someone to love or hate."

TrueReddit,3dr6kk,irlcheologist,7,Sun Jul 19 00:52:20 2015 UTC,"Attention Deficit Disorder  The afternoon sun angled through a tear in the tent. Ma Bao-Zhi grunted, then shifted his face towards the shade and screwed up his eyes. In the absence of light, the retinal burns from his always-on pupil-tracking HUD-halo danced before his field of vision. He sat up and stretched. It was a new day.  The corner of his visual field that was perpetually occupied by the DistroNet feed blinked. A major announcement was incoming from the most influential association of experts that he had ever been a part of: The Council Of Two Million With A Remit Of Everything.  The upstart replacement of last year's not-hegemon, the Coven of Eight to the Seven; Masters of Knowledge, the Council had, yesterday, consisted of just over 50.3% of the surviving inhabitants of what had once been Taiwan SAR. However, as he scanned the headlines, he noted that an overnight disputation on the meaning of Buddha-nature had resulted in nearly two hundred being purged from the membership roster, and, more importantly, from the Council's ReDistroList. Ma had never posted to any discussion regarding Buddha-nature, for which he was now extremely thankful.  Attention Distribution Cannot Be Gamed, he though, nodding to himself. It was a mantra every child knew, and it was obviously true. 'Gaming' would imply an illegitimate practice, and since the attention economy was inherently legitimate, any practice that arose thereof could not be 'gaming'. The use of randomly-assigned attention redistribution lists to strengthen the network-influence of an association of experts was one of the most powerful practices there was - without it, no modern association of experts could compete.  With the saccadic grace of long practice, his pupils flipped to the updated, slightly smaller ReDistroList, and settled down to start his highly-encouraged ten hours of daily network-reinforcement. Ten hours - ten icons - each one painstakingly designed by the expert it represented. The Coven of Eight to the Seven had highly encouraged eight hours of ReDistroList attention, but the Council's superior attention ethic had led to an expert association network both wider and deeper in links, and thus, far more influential. The Coven defined their area of expertise too narrowly, and left themselves open to a ratio attack. It was a trivial task for the Council to dial down the attention ratio of key knowledge industries overnight, leaving the Coven rudderless and sinking. Ma had been a third-quartile defector, holding out longer than most; his punishment was to enter the Council with six month's half-ratio deficit. Half as likely to be randomly assigned to other experts ReDistroList, he counted himself lucky - the fourth quartile had been exiled entirely. As is, he was comfortably off in a deficit camp outside Taibao.  Ma shook himself; introspection was an audience of one. The first icon belonged to Tracy Liu: 166kg, pink highlights and moderator by acclaim of a yaoi fandom for the ancient classic, Glengarry Glen Ross.  The minutes ticked by, and as the completion bar for the first icon flipped over into green and Tracy's hand-drawn icon faded from sight - young Al Pacino gently cupping young Jack Lemmon's testicles on a bed of index cards - Ma decided that he would treat himself with an hour of free attention. He rucked the covers back from his legs and withdrew his 75MHz future-proofed laptop from its pouch.  Minutes later, halfway through the boot-sequence, Ma heard the unmistakable whirring of a Bother-Gyro. He dug rapidly through the contents of the tent for the thick blanket he'd found the week before, to muffle the fans of the laptop, but the blanket had been redistributed. It was too late anyway: the Bother-Gyro's tracking software had heard the fans.  ""Go away!"" shouted Ma.  < Hello Friend And How Are You And Woo! >  The Bother-Gyro hovered just out of Ma's reach.  ""滚蛋!""  < Would You Like A Comestible?! Marmalade Is In This Week! >  ""Fuck off.""  Bother-Gyros were increasingly common, flying over the water from the Penghu Collective, and Ma had tangled with them before, when he was a high-ratio member of the Coven: an attractive target. The Collective were Min-speakers, and the language barrier was starving them of culture-based attention, and forcing them to desperate measures. He knew that while they would advertise to any moving object, their main purpose was to gain the attention of the victim. Even compared to the average camp member, Ma's influence ratio was low...  ""Hey! Bot! There's a high-ratio family just over that wall! You can bother them all at once! Think of the attention gains!""  Unfortunately for Ma, the Bother-Gyro was also running off a 75MHz chip, which did not support voice recognition. Even more unfortunately, what little resources it did have to bring to bear were mainly concentrated on measuring the direction of gaze of the victim, and Ma's gaze had briefly moved from the Gyro to the wall he was gesturing at. The Gyro aimed a module at the RFID tag on Ma's halo.  pffffsss  ""Fuck!""  Pepper-spray will catch anyone's attention.  Whilst Ma rolled around in the dirt, the Bother-Gyro gently settled on the ground next to him, conserving battery. Proximity was worth less attention than direct eye-contact, but it was still worth something. After a minute, the database updated the Gyro on Ma's uninspiring attention value, and it buzzed off in search of less deficient prey.  The afternoon was nearly over before Ma's eyes stopped watering, and the pupil-tracker started to update correctly. Luckily, his HUD-halo was undamaged - it could still receive and transmit audio, video, pupil-tracking data and, indeed, record everything that Ma did. Nine hours of ReDistroList remained on his schedule, but he had bigger things on his mind. Of all the places, his deficit camp was lucky enough to be in viewing distance of a celebrity battle.  It wasn't entirely by chance, of course. Celebrity Mechas were very power-hungry, and required tethering to the grid network, and deficit camps had the tendency to spring up in unused land along grid lines. While city dwellers might have had the massed influence to force such a destructive event outside their municipal margins, a deficit camp by definition could not face up to even the most minor celebrity's choice of land-resource.  This particular battle was between the gigantic robots piloted by a pornography magnate and a man who was extremely good at making videos of cats. Hovering cameras darted about the provided every possible angle around the machines, while in-cockpit vision was granted by cameras attached to both control modules. There were no adverts - the battle itself drew all the attention the participants needed.  The pornographer had outfitted his mecha with water sprinklers, providing the substrate for projected holograms of noted starlets and their riveting performances. The cat man, showing disdain for the practice of up-attending, had a far more stripped-down mecha, bowing to demand only by having a control module shaped like a cat's head. While his initial surge in influence had been off the back of a pet British Shorthair, his true power came from his decision to breed several thousand of the creatures and lock them in a vast complex filled with pastel colors and assorted common household items. Cuteness, too, can be brute-forced.  As the two machines started to stride towards each other, Ma watched camp-dwellers who sought influence more than health run between the legs of the mechas. Like so much in the attention economy, it was a dual payoff. Simply being near a mecha guaranteed a proportion of the attention that the pilot was constantly exuding, and that was worth the risk of injury in itself. But, if a camera tracked by millions happened to autofocus on a lucky expert? Why, a single second's worth of attention was more than the expert might otherwise see in a lifetime.  The battle was joined, and as the mechas stamped to and fro, they came closer and closer to the western edge of the camp - the edge furthest from Ma. Even those experts in the camp whose lack of attention ethics had placed them dangerously close to exile from their associations could not help but pay heed. Lasers flashed, missiles flew, and clouds of smoke emerged even when not strictly necessary. In fact, the battle, like most battles, was more bark than bite: it was considered bad form to actually kill another celebrity, not least because it tended to alienate part of your potential audience. After all, who didn't enjoy both pornography and cat videos?  The din didn't just attract the attention of experts - from miles around, Bother-Gyros wheeled in, guided by the very human tendency to correlate decibels and attention. Ma gazed in wonder as a two flocks of gyros of different manufacture, bathed in the proximity wash from the mechas, each mistook the other flock as the source of attention. Overriding the normal guideline that led them to disperse for maximal coverage, the gyros spiralled madly in ever decreasing circles as they sought to increase that flow.  As he watched, the gyrating super-flock, consisting of nearly a hundred Bother-Gyros, whirled into the cloud of spray being produced by pornographer's mechanical contraption. A hundred automatic protection circuits flared into action, and the mass of gyros punched in the opposite direction - straight into the air intake ducts of the cat-mecha."
TrueReddit,3dr6kk,sacesu,5,Sun Jul 19 01:41:18 2015 UTC,"One gyro would have been unfortunate. Five would have led to an emergency shutdown. But no mecha-designer had considered such a freak occurrence as the emergent behaviour so briefly displayed by the gyro-flocks. Admittedly, QA and Safety were neglected disciplines ever since the advent of the attention economy - who would dedicate their lives to a discipline that involved something so unquantifiable as preventing rare occurrences? After all, it's not as though someone might lose their accumulated attention - just their lives.  With a massive crunch, the flywheels at the center of the cat-mecha broke apart, releasing a torrent of kinetic energy, and sending parts of the mecha in every direction. The pornographer tried to backpedal his mecha away from the burning debris, but his attention elsewhere, he stepped directly on one of the experts that had been trailing his footsteps. As his machine overturned, the pornographer clutched at the control panel, seeking the emergency eject key, but by chance also fat-fingering the steam overcharge system. The porn-mecha's control module blasted off the chassis - straight into the side of one of the few fixed-wall buildings in the camp. The steam explosion, while softer, was far more deadly.  Ma had hit the ground as soon as he saw the first gyro sucked into the air-intake - luckily so, as burning debris had taken out several of his neighbours. Now, his view obscured by what remained of the same three foot-wall he had urged the gyro to surmount earlier that day, he flicked his eyes to open a newsline. The events of the past minute had gone viral - his feed was already filling with commentary from the other side of the world. Every last survivor would soon be bombarded with requests for commentary on the death of the celebrities.  Celebrities plural? The feed from the cat-mecha was still active. In fact, the explosion had blown the control module right over the camp, landing to the east, far from the screams of the scalded and poisoned camp dwellers. Ma held a rag over as much of his mouth and nose as he could reach through his HUD-halo, and levered himself to his feet.  The cat man was alive. In fact, he was almost unhurt - a mere fractured collarbone. He was, however, trapped inside his module, and mouthing something - the audio feed from his cockpit had cut out. Ma tore his attention from his HUD-halo and looked out, directly at the smoking module in the distance.  Never mind proximity attention - to be the man who saved a celebrity from almost certain death? To be the only source of an audio feed for the sole celebrity survivor of what the international feeds were calling the Disaster of Taibao?  Ma started to trot towards the control module, avoiding the prone bodies of those less fortunate survivors, around some of whom flames still flickered. He tore his foot away from the grasp of one, whilst muttering thanks for the last few seconds of absolute attention they granted him. He stepped over a corpse, then briefly glanced behind him. The least concussed of the able-bodied camp survivors were already moving after him. Turning his back to the setting sun, Ma broke into a run.  -by Cefte"

If a product needs advertising, it's probably not a good product.   Let's say we banned advertising. We'd end up with a marketplace of only the objectively best products. We'd probably have a superior society as a result."

TrueReddit,3dr6kk,TriangleDimes,6,Sat Jul 18 22:39:08 2015 UTC,"Personally I think that if advertising were outright banned, and activity like that was illegal, there would be less of it. Right now, I think it's safe to assume that any publication that takes advertising is under some sort of pressure from those advertisers. If you study the way publications that don't take advertisers protect themselves, it's quite drastic. Consumer Reports comes to mind. Like you've pointed out, pressure can some from covert means. Sock puppet accounts for instance. In the past, fake hate mail campaigns. Individual reporters can easily be compromised. Roger Ebert wouldn't accept the typical movie reviewer trips studios offered.   I think there's an argument to be made that advertising doesn't constitute speech in a 1st Amendment sense, and at the very least should be banned from publicly-owned airwaves (violation of government propaganda laws?) but no one has so far made this argument."
TrueReddit,3dr6kk,maxitobonito,5,Sat Jul 18 22:52:17 2015 UTC,"advertising is just what happens after you do proper marketing and then reach out to your demographic. That's how they find out about things, that's how you build a buzz. Advertising is letting people know a sale is on or that a certain product has changed.   A movie trailer is an advertisement, so are sponsorships. It's not just commercials you don't like and junk mail, it's how a indie game company builds up momentum (this is actually really important in attracting investors; you can do it without paid advertising but some form of outreach and hustling is generally required which is basically the same thing) it's how a shoestore stays in business, it's how an electrician attracts clients. When people say ""advertisers"" they think of big ad agencies, but it's clients. Ad people serve clients, it's the clients who are running all of this; the businesses themselves and their desire it to let people know about this thing they do, usually something they poured their lives into."
TrueReddit,3dr6kk,flippy3,4,Sun Jul 19 03:32:11 2015 UTC,"I couldn't disagree more. You will still have makerting, of which advertising is a tool. Branding, labels, pricing, logos, packaging, PR even distribution to some extent, all that affect the behaviour of consumers, perhaps, at least to some extent, even more than advertising itself. And companies, even those that sell good quality stuff, need all that to catch your attention, especially in cluttered, highly competitive market."

I'm not promoting the re-introduction of the economic system made the no-advert environment possible - I'm just saying what it felt like when I dipped a toe into a less consumerist society. The overall tone of the article is spot on. It's obviously touched a few nerves in order to deserve the point by point rebuttal above.

It detracts from the point and lets pedantic nitpickers pick at the trees instead of seeing the forest.  Question is (and yes, it's asking for ideals and not realistic stats)... how much do you value your time - your limited time on earth, your health? And hence, how much do you value your brainpower and attention? Those are easily manipulated.  And more so, is it OK for someone to manipulate you for free? Yes, they're buying your attention - but not from you. They're buying from a 3rd party that undervalues it anyway. But you have no say in that.  You can effectively walk down the street, not notice the brand names on the billboards... but if they're in your field of vision, your brain processes that neon orange sign regardless. That's mental bandwidth used up.  Sure, you can stay indoors, turn off the TV, ignore the internet and sit in a sealed vacuum. And thus, going outside is you consenting to giving away your attention to advertisers? It shouldn't be. Let me ask you for a moment of your time that will profit me over you, What's your answer to that? I bet it'd be along the lines of ""**** you, pay me.""  But, that's how the system's currently designed.  Is there an alternative? None I know of.  But it's a damn good question - how much do you value your time/health... and thus how much do you value your own attention?"
TrueReddit,3dr6kk,AbbyJaneway,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:57:04 2015 UTC,"God, this is just the dumbest. I work in advertising, and like everyone in advertising, I am more cynical than you are about our product. Fuck this, it's late—DEEP DIVE.   Advertising is a natural resource extraction industry, like a fishery. Its business is the harvest and sale of human attention. We are the fish and we are not consulted.   Sure, why not, I almost agree. But your salmon isn't wild caught, you bastard, it's farmed. All that delicious fish food you're eating comes from somewhere. Plankton isn't spontaneously generated in your tank.   Two problems result from this. The solution to both requires legal recognition of the property rights of human beings over our attention.   Gah, you don't like it, turn the fucking TV off. Nobody's writing ""Crest WhiteStrips"" on the fireflies in your back yard.   First, advertising imposes costs on individuals without permission or compensation. It extracts our precious attention and emits toxic by-products, such as the sale of our personal information to dodgy third parties.   Your permission is implicit in using/visiting advertiser supported (read: free to you) media. If your attention was so precious you'd be reading nonfiction or hand-building kayaks, and if you care about your information an ad blocker and privatized facebook account will do most of the work for you.   Second, you may have noticed that the world's fisheries are not in great shape. They are a standard example for explaining the theoretical concept of a tragedy of the commons, where rational maximising behaviour by individual harvesters leads to the unsustainable overexploitation of a resource.   This is a standard example of a straw man argument.   Expensively trained human attention is the fuel of twenty-first century capitalism. We are allowing a single industry to slash and burn vast amounts of this productive resource in search of a quick buck.   The premise that human attention sans advertising is inherently productive is nutso. If you deleted all the advertising off the internet, consumption of kitten gifs would not budge. Advertising isn't slashing and burning human attention spans, the trees are leaning towards the saws and matches.    A classic market failure   The advertising industry consists of the buying and selling of your attention between third parties without your consent. That means that the cost of producing the good - access to your attention - doesn't reflect its full social cost.   Your consent is implicit every time you get enjoyable content for free. The market failure here is the economic and moral hyper-valuation of your attention.   Movie theatres, cable channels, phone apps, bill-board operators, and so on price the sale of your attention at what it takes to extract it from you - namely, how easy it is for you to escape their predations. This is often much lower than the value to you, or to others, of directing your attention to something else.   Billboards are garbage and should be outlawed. The rest of these things, his argument is that they deliberately make them enjoyable to keep you paying attention? The horror. The shame. Oatmeal and Chaucer for everyone.   Since advertisers pay less to access your attention than your attention is worth to you, an excessive (inefficient) amount of advertising is produced.    Again, if your attention was worth so much you'd be living an ad-free, subscription only lifestyle with a remarkably narrow viewpoint. A surfeit of advertising is produced based on market inefficiencies—engagement is low, so CPMs are low.   We are all continuously swamped by attempts to distract us from what we actually want to do - like watch a movie or listen to a song - with messages we don't want or need. Being constantly addressed in this way changes how we think and behave: it makes us harried and irritable, and we try to cope by closing ourselves off from the world and each other.   Oh god fuck you. If you want to watch a movie or listen to a song free of advertisements, you have that option—purchase of a product at full retail price. And don't pretend your right to watch fucking Minions is a sacrosanct social good. ""I want to be entertained for free"" is not an economic argument.   It's a classic case of market failure. The problem has the same basic structure as the overfishing of the seas or global warming.    Only inasmuch as you presume that being forced to consider switching deodorants is going to return Micronesia to the Pacific.   In economics language, people's attention is a common good.    Have you ever met actual people?   Taken moment by moment it is a finite resource, like a sandwich, whose consumption by any party means that other parties can't consume it, including the person themselves (rivalrous).   I can only assume this is some sort of rotting six foot party sub."

TrueReddit,3dr6kk,BrutDiddly,3,Sun Jul 19 08:55:06 2015 UTC,"At the same time, our current institutions make it difficult for any party to prevent others from consuming it (non-excludable). Our attention is a valuable commodity and a vast number of businesses are determined to dig it out of us and sell it before someone else does.   ""Your attention is valuable and I'm mad it's not being subsidized in a direction of my choosing""    Why now?   Advertising is an old racket, but these days it feels as if we are almost drowning in its insidious manipulative bullshit    This phrase makes me wonder if the author has an undisclosed bias.   inside novels, in airplanes, on concert tickets, on poor-people's foreheads, on eggs in grocery stores, on public trash cans, on the inside and outside of public buses, in police cells and on police cars, on the back of toilet doors, inside newspaper ""articles"" and on and on and on. Why is this so? A number of reasons suggest themselves.   Most of the ads I've seen inside novels were a) inside bad novels and b) for other bad novels, which only reinforces my belief that he mis-values human attention. How many ads have you seen on poor people's foreheads? Eggs? Transportation advertising is an attempt to create value from otherwise blank space. You know why they need that value? A lot of transportation companies are rackets, but that's not what we're discussing.   First, as we have become more wealthy our consumption decisions have become more valuable. People can now be induced to pay much more for a carefully branded and positioned beer product than the competitive market price of the mere commodity of ""beer.""    Yes, because Bud Light and Heady Topper are inherently the same quality of product. Fuck this guy.   We desire and can afford a more interesting consumption experience. As a result, supernormal profits are available to those who can persuade consumers to buy their version of beer.    Or the broader distribution of advertising allows smaller companies to effectively target people with an interest in their product, democratizing both beer and beer advertising at the same time...   Of course, economics wins in the long run: the promise of those supernormal profits both attracts competitors and finances increased spending on advertising to compete to attract customers' attention until economic profits fall back towards zero. But in the meantime, a vast quantity of advertising has been produced.   ""I don't want market competition or different types of beer. Politbïer and media silence for me, please.""   Second, a shift in social norms has made it more acceptable to sell other people's attention.    Source?   Increased prices [ed: of?] have spurred the development of a sophisticated market for our attention, together with an entire industrial sector of attention miners. Anyone in a position to access our attention, like the managers of pubs or hockey arenas, will be approached by multiple companies offering to pay a fee to install their advertising screens, banners, or cookies.   If you go to a pub or hockey arena and have your attention monopolized by a banner featuring the logo of the beer you're probably already drinking—you're your own problem.   Advertising has become harder to ignore. Advertisers can hunt us more assiduously and individually as we browse the internet, their banner ads and pop-ups following us around no matter where we go.   Or, advertising has become more targeted, and is more difficult to ignore because the products you're being presented more closely match your self-identified shopping behavior and lifestyle.   Simultaneous to the appearance of this new opportunity for rentier profits has come a weakening of our moral constraints against exploiting this kind of power over people. Whether you call it neo-liberalism or something else, we are certainly living under the domination of a cult of market individualism.    I have no idea what restraints he's talking about or when they might have existed. This is sloppy sentimentality masquerading as academic research and the majority of the attention being wasted is mine.   The result is not only that it has become morally acceptable to sell off other people's attention without their consent in the name of free market economics.    You know what we sold off before we sold off people's attention? People.   But, in addition, anyone who refuses to do so is considered an economic idiot - someone who leaves money on the table. If she is an agent for the owners, like the manager of a city's public bus fleet, then she is guilty of neglecting her moral duty as a trustee to secure and advance their financial interests.   ""I can put an ad on the side of the bus the poor people ride or charge the poor people more money to ride it. Morally, I must insist they pay more for the privilege of not having their attention diluted during their commute.""   Thirdly, technology has made advertising even more intrusive. Not only is it now possible to print advertisements on grocery store eggs and to put digital displays above pub urinals.    I can only imagine the social good my mind would have been calculating whilst buying eggs and/or pissing into a trough.   The digital age has added an extra level of exploitation. Every moment we spend on the internet or with our smart phones is being captured, repackaged and sold to advertisers multiple times. Advertisers (and other third parties like credit rating agencies) will pay a great deal for our profiles because the better they know us the greater the effectiveness of their advertising. That's another way of saying that their advertising becomes harder to ignore. They can hunt us more assiduously and individually as we browse the internet, their banner ads and pop-ups following us around no matter where we go.   Yep. But cut the ""Think of the children!"" of ""exploitation."" If you're dicking around, you're being advertised to. The notepad where you write shitty alarmist hand-wringing articles masquerading as economic analysis doesn't have ads, so you're safe, Thomas Wells.    Counter-counter arguments: How economists defend advertising and why it isn't enough   The existence of the advertising industry poses something of a challenge to the ideology of free market economics since it seems to go against the principles of consumer sovereignty and consumer welfare (efficiency). Two justifications are prominent in the defence of advertising. First, that it is directly valuable for consumers because it communicates valuable information. Second, that it funds universal access to ""club goods"" (like television shows and internet services) whose production is socially valued but would otherwise not be financially viable. There is some merit to both of these, but I think they are far from sufficient.   ""Advertising tells people about things they might like and subsidizes their interest in other things but it's crappy because they sometimes have to look at it.""   3.1. The direct value of advertising  Several mechanisms are usually appealed to at this point by economists. First, that advertising gives consumers valuable information about the sellers and prices of products they want to buy. The favoured example here is the classified ads section in newspapers. This saves consumers the attention it would have cost to do their own research and encourages producers to compete more strongly on price, thereby allowing consumers to make more efficient purchasing choices.   This is one thing advertising does, sure.   Perhaps it was the case in 1961 that consumers struggled to find such information for themselves.    Was it or wasn't it, Wells? You're the expert.   But it is hard to see how this can still be the case in the internet age, where price comparison websites centralise such information in a far more convenient format than billboards and classified ads.   Find me one of these that isn't advertising-supported.   (Incidentally, this is something which many companies resist, for example, by deliberately offering complex and non-comparable service packages.)  This argument also seems to neglect the fact that information has costs as well as benefits, especially when you consider the difference between publishing information for consumers to find and advertising as we know it. Advertisements do not concern what the consumer is interested in finding out,    I thought we did a better job targeting user interests than ever, thereby making our product harder to ignore?   but what the producer wants to sell. That is why producers pay to access consumers rather than the other way round.   Consumers pay access to producers every time they buy a product. On what planet would people pay to view ads? (Hint: Probably not Earth)."
TrueReddit,3dr6kk,OriginalStomper,2,Sun Jul 19 07:07:25 2015 UTC,"Advertising can be used to reduce competition: high spending by rich established players drowns out information from smaller newer competitors and thus creates an entry barrier, converting markets to oligopolies.    Or, advertising can promote media fragmentation, allowing challenger brands a chance at market relevance that would not be available in a more narrowly tailored media landscape.   And advertisements are deliberately constructed to manipulate consumers rather than to inform them, by exploiting our cognitive biases with misleading headline prices, statistical fallacies and so on (behavioural economics research has been very influential here).   People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, Thomas.   Heavy processing by consumers, and often further research, is required to make this ""free"" information usable for decision-making.  Second is the counter-intuitive claim that brands communicate their trustworthiness by their conspicuous expenditure on advertising not by what it actually says. When considering which version of the generic washing machine to buy, the rational consumer has to weigh up lots of claims about quality against the objective fact of price. If a brand can demonstrate that its quality claims are credible that makes the consumer's decision much less of a gamble. Like banks housed in grand marbled buildings, companies which pour vast amounts of money into advertising campaigns must be supremely confident about the quality of their products and its long-term sales. Otherwise they couldn't afford to burn so much money on ridiculous Super Bowl ads.   Half correct, but it's not quality and trustworthiness, it's awareness and affinity. If an ad can make a certain number of consumers discover and consider a product, it has paid for itself and those profits can be reinvested in the company (or an ad budget that can attract W+K).   In effect, advertising tries to do our practical reasoning for us, shaping and ordering our inchoate desires into actionable preferences for specific products. But will buying those things really make us happy?   Probably not. But ranking advertising as a prominent source of pain in the human condition does us too great a service.   This argument rather reminds me of John Maynard Keynes's suggestion that in a recession caused by a collapse of aggregate demand one could solve the problem by burying bottles filled with bank notes and then leaving it to private enterprise to dig them up again. Once again, it is not that this argument makes no sense at all, but that it takes no account of opportunity cost - the fact that we have better options. As Keynes put it, ""It would, indeed, be more sensible to build houses and the like; but if there are political and practical difficulties in the way of this, the above would be better than nothing.""   Yep, because burying money and advertising products to potential consumers make the same amount of economic sense. Also, to whom? God jesus, don't study economics at Groningen, for your own sake.   Companies wanting to demonstrate their confidence in their products don't have to waste so much of our time to do so. There are all sorts of more constructive ways of spending money conspicuously.    These examples are going to be super tasty.   For example, any large company these days has enormous discretion over its effective tax rate. A company prepared to pay billions more in tax than it can get away with must be very confident of itself and could communicate that fact to customers by publishing it prominently on its products.    What!? Your marketing strategy is to pay more taxes? Who would give a shit? Furthermore, how would they find out without advertising-supported media to cover the story? Also, your competitors would immediately have an enormous capital advantage over you and would exploit it mercilessly. This is literally the worst idea I have ever heard in the history of business. This man should be put in stocks and pelted with rotting fruit by economists whose entire trade has been discredited by this abortion of an article.   Or, to reassure customers of its very long-term viability, it could switch to a defined benefits pension system for its employees.    Which would in no way impact its ability to react to market forces in the future   Or it could give large amounts of money directly to hospitals and schools and publish its philanthropy [ed: WHERE?] as a proportion of revenue - perhaps it could make this specific to a certain product by promising to donate the first $50 million in sales.   C'mon. Corporate philanthropy already exists. It's reasonably, though not especially, effective. I can assure you that the ROI of donation-first marketing budget is lower than the ROI of a solid marketing campaign, which makes this unsound from a business perspective, and furthermore this would simultaneously cripple the publishing industries that Wells expects to carry these companies' water, while also making it almost impossible for businesses to differentiate themselves from the competition. I get that he's making a point, I just can't tell if he's an idiot or ideologue.   Third, is the social status that advertising can confer on a product and its consumption. What's the point of buying a Rolex or Mercedes unless the people around you know that it is expensive and are able to appreciate how rich and successful you must be? The business logic here is sound, but not the moral logic. After all, what this comes down to is that these companies deliberately waste the attention of the 99% of the population who can't afford their products just so those who do buy them can bask in the knowledge that everyone knows the price of what they are wearing and driving. Such advertising constitutes a regressive tax imposed on the rest of us by luxury brands in order to increase the value of their products to rich people.   Half true. More than 1% of the population can afford a Mercedes, and have the opportunity to choose between Mercedes, Audi, and BMW, which is why Mercedes advertises broadly. Also, a huge portion of luxury brands don't advertise to the 99% at all.   There is one further argument that occurs to me although I haven't seen it made by economists: that advertising creates value by spinning a story around a brand that customers want to buy into. They turn a mundane commodity item, like shoes or a computer, into a choice of lifestyle and a means to further your conception of the good. A kid puts on a cape and imagines herself a crime-fighting superhero. This is a crude version of the socially sustained illusions that adults can build our whole lives around and which are nowadays sculpted, in part, by advertisers. Their products become an end worth pursuing in themselves, rather than merely a means.   The fact that Thomas Wells hasn't heard this mentioned by economists should tell you everything you need to know about Thomas Wells, Economist.   I think the fashioning of these illusions - turning clothes into fashion; turning food into health; turning diamonds into love - is the most significant way that advertising creates economic value, as real as the transformation of steel into a car or cotton into cloth. But I am dubious of the worth of its achievement. In effect, advertising tries to do our practical reasoning for us, shaping and ordering our inchoate [ed: using the same five dollar word twice isn't worth $10] desires into actionable preferences for specific products. But will buying those things really make us happy?   This is the second time you've posed this question and the second time I'll answer: probably not, but without fleeting illusions of happiness crippling nihilism results in some combination of hedonism, fundamentalism or fatalism. Pick two and start your advertising-free death cult.   3.2. Financing public goods  Advertising is the financial model for many pure public goods like terrestrial television and radio, as well as club goods like newspapers, Google's search/email and Facebook. These are goods that tend to have very low variable costs - meaning the cost of serving an extra individual is almost nothing.    Yet the conception and production of these goods was predicated on the assumption of wealth from serving a large number of individuals.   The socially optimal level of production is universal access at the marginal cost of zero.    Free Facebook is what we're aspiring to, now?   Yet there are still significant fixed costs that must be recouped if producing it is to be financially sustainable. In cases of pure public goods, it is implausible to charge individuals for access.   No one has ever paid for public transportation.   In cases of clubbable goods, one could take a subscription approach, but its transaction costs might raise the price well above the profit maximising price.    And indeed would.   In addition, the profit-maximising price of a subscription will exclude most people from access (the path chosen by the academic publishing and pharmaceutical industries), meaning a deadweight loss in social welfare.  Advertising provides an alternative revenue source that makes it possible to profitably provide such services universally at the marginal cost of production - that is, zero. Advertising thus solves a problem the invisible hand couldn't reach and thereby makes us collectively much better off.   By ""the invisible hand couldn't reach"" you mean ""literally the definition of the invisible hand as laid out in The Wealth of Nations, right?  Quoth the Adam: ""and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.""  The greatest variation from the invisible hand isn't the creation of public goods, it's the pretension that the motive isn't just profit. This is mostly a lie."

That's not correct. To apply a label to a type of idea or analytical framework etc as intellectual shorthand does not mean that the person(s) associated with that label is credited for being the only human, who ever had that thought etc.   For example: Some number of mathematicians through history up to the present have espoused a belief that math is real---like part of reality. We might say they have a Platonic understanding of mathematical truth. Is the word ""Platonic"" supposed to mean all these mathematicians are just dopes repeating Plato? Of course not! It just means their viewpoint on this subject is similar to Plato's description of Form etc. It is shorthand.  Again, lots of people might have had ideas about interpreting parts of the human experience through the prism of class structure. But Marx was the first and most thorough in critiquing the modern liberal state in terms of class struggle. So the name has stuck.

TrueReddit,3drq9u,Bartek_Bialy,0,Sun Jul 19 21:34:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything here.  Democracy essentially doesn't work at all.  Or it doesn't do what it tells us it's supposed to do.  The propaganda is that democracy (tm) is supposed to allow the people a voice in government and to prevent powerful people from running all over them.  That the freedom of any individual is sacred as are his rights to speak, think and within reason act as he wishes are benefits of living in a democracy.    First of all, no society is propagandized like a democratic society.  Since any change must be made with our consent, billions upon billions of dollars are spent manufacturing that consent.  What you think about any social issues matters a great deal to those who want you to agree with them.  And great public pressure will be applied to make sure that the popular people and those who have influence express the proper opinions.  A democratic society made a man apologize in tears for daring to launch a rocket while wearing the wrong shirt.  After all, the proles must never see their heroes in anti-feminist shirts.  A democratic society forced a CEO to resign from Firefox for funding a DOMA initiative on the ballot of California.  It's a perfectly legal campaign, and given that the ballot issue passed at the time, it was popular.  I don't agree with either of these guys, the shirt was ugly, and DOMA was a stupid law, but my point is that this type of thing is something that democratic propaganda would say of totalitarianism.  The image of Soviet Russia we were fed in the 1980s was the show trials and forced apology campaigns that are common news in Western Democracies.    While other systems aren't always better, I find it hard to believe that an old European monarch would have wasted much time or money telling average people they have to agree with his reasoning.  The only thing that they cared about was loyalty to the crown and obedience.  A medieval king legalizing gay marriage would have issued a decree saying that it was the law, and that would be it.  No debates, no campaigns, just do it.  And he probably wouldn't care much what ye old cake decorator thought about it.  You could hate the idea, you could love it, but King Sven the Fabulous made a decree, and you're going to obey.    The second lie is that voting gives the people a voice.  But it's not actually true, as the article states.  It takes loads of money to really get heard even at the state level.  There are studies showing that the bills that actually pass are those the elites favor.  There's a revolving door between being in congress and later working for the companies they ""regulated""  -- often for millions.  The millions required to run for office come from somewhere, and it's not the average worker.  But voting, imo has a different function.  It's not about ""giving the little man a voice"", as the propaganda says, but about keeping them invested in the system.  There's a famous rat experiment that shows that a rat will spend more time poking a lever if the treats are given randomly.  And that's what voting is.  People spend time watching and debating about which guy should win, they pull the lever, and tell their buddies to do the same.  Every once in a great while, they get something from the effort, but even if they lose, they just resolve to pull the lever even harder the next time.  Which puts other options off the table.  After all, they can still vote, right?  But I think the average person was better off under a monarch.  A monarch cannot be bought, he's already rich, and he doesn't need a re-election war chest.  That makes him independent enough to be able to say no to lobbyists.  Therefore if there's a regulation, it's not written by someone who expects a million dollar parachute.  It's to reign in the excesses of that company.  The average guy is also much freer to find ways to get the monarchs attention.  Voting is easily manipulated, but large protests get attention from any ruler.  A single riot at a New York gay bar changed more about American culture than 50 years of voting.  Riots in ferguson got people to pay attention to ferguson, yet they've been voting for generations and getting nowhere. Or if the ruler is religious, excommunication can be a good way to get leverage."

Some of it is just silly, like the discomfort that not all money exists in physical form (paragraphs 5-6). Some of it sounds dangerously naive, like the suggestion that central banks should print money to fund more government spending (paragraph 8)."
TrueReddit,3dr0hj,joe_navark,6,Sat Jul 18 17:54:06 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that the discomfort with fractional reserve banking, at least the way OP phrases it (a scandal uncovered!) is silly.  There are a number of ways for a banking sector to work.  Fractional reserve is one, the system expoused by Wolf in the linked FT article is another.  More exist.  Each, including fractional reserve, has with its own pros and cons.  (For example, the cited government committee that determines optimal levels of money creation for economic growth in the Wolf article sounds strange to me.)    The second point, that QE is focused on conveying value to the financial sector and that value in turn has gone to risky investments that only have a positive IRR because of low interest rates instead of loans to small businesses, has been elsewhere more eloquently by others.  QE could be directed elsewhere, e.g. the government could give people interest free loans that are used to refinance credit card debt, student loans and mortgages, or to buy municipal bonds, or to lend to private actors on the condition precedent that it be used to fund a submitted job creation program, or any manner of ideas.  As always, each plan has its own pros and cons.    What OP maybe misses is that central banks are subject to political constraints, and the decision to provide liquidity to banks by purchasing MBS's, which in turn would fund additional lending to the housing sector to in turn lift home prices was the idea that had broad enough political support to enact.  It's a sop to bankers and homeowners, but Congress isn't going to strip the Fed of its independence because voters are unhappy about rising house prices."

It's a discomfort that money is virtually fabricated from thin air, without being backed by a real value. It's a discomfort with the fractional reserve system that allows banks to fabricate money up to 8 times what they really have as deposits. You may refer to Martin Wolf's opinion herein: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7f000b18-ca44-11e3-bb92-00144feabdc0.html As for your second point, central banks are increasing the money supply regularly (through quantitative easing and other mechanisms). That's technically ""printing money"". Yet, that new money goes exclusively into banks' pockets. Instead, it should be used to fund governmental development programs. And that's not naive at all.

Or that putting money into the market works something like Say's law in that more money means more consumption?  Don't overlook the fact that most money is created through debt--(except QE) so the act of creating money and with it growth is also the act of increasing leverage. The amount of this leverage is a vulnerability--the risk of default increases proportionally with the amount of debt.   So with the growth economies covet also comes the instability of market failure, which they never expect.   Unlike the author, im not bothered by this kind of money model. In fact im comforted by it--because with money so easily created, the potential to fix debt problems in the world is great. We are not now bounded by a lack if resources--like money--we are now mostly bounded by will.   We have that going for us, which is good."

TrueReddit,3dr0hj,thewilsonline,3,Sat Jul 18 21:19:44 2015 UTC,"To observe that money is created from nowhere is true but only interesting in the sense that it disrupts the illusion of finance as material reality. What's rather more significant is to observe that the money created is always in the form of money which is owed to the bank (generally a privately owned corporation), along with any interest that might accrue on this created money. So it's not only money being created from nowhere, but debt to a privately owned corporation is created from nowhere, along with all the power inequalities and one directional obligations that are synonymous with debtor/creditor relations. After all, debts have to be paid, don't they? And surely it's absurd to talk of any kind of debt forgiveness. . .  So we see that modern finance is an astonishing machine whose outcomes are social inequality and the accumulation of wealth and power by those who have enough existing capital to lend it out to others."
TrueReddit,3dr0hj,BeABetterHumanBeing,2,Sat Jul 18 22:16:42 2015 UTC,"Debt is only created when you go to the bank for a loan.  Let's say we are bartering. 1 bushel of corn for one chicken. You want to barter for ten chickens but only have enough corn for 5 now. But you need ten Immediately because you are making some of your corn Into cornbread for further bartering. If you paid me 10 now you wouldn't have any corn for cornbread which has better barter potential for other goods you want.  I agree to give you ten chickens now for 5 bushels of corn now, and the promise of 7 more bushels down the road.  The reason I ask for 12 instead of 10 bushels is you want or need the chickens now and I take some risk you may never pay me back.  Voila. Debt and interest created without banks or money.   When you get a car loan, you need the car now to get to your job and you don't have 16000 in a bank. The bank loans you money. and you pay back more than the vue because the bank is taking a risk you won't be able to pay it all back and also because you need the car now."
TrueReddit,3dr0hj,BeABetterHumanBeing,2,Sun Jul 19 00:33:19 2015 UTC,"Since I did not once suggest banks or money are required to create debt, nor does your stating the ostensible mechanism of a loan change anything I said above, this reply is little worth a response and I generally wouldn't take the time to make one. Still, I want to take a brief look at the general form of your analogy.  This kind of construction of a barter narrative is always an attempt to grant an economic process a fundamental basis and legitimacy drawn from everyday existence. We see that financial activities are virtual and abstract and at great distance from the basic expression of everyday human need and desire, so we try to show that those financial activities are really just shortcuts for that basic experience.   The problem is that no society has ever been observed which used barter for daily economic activity, with the sole exception of sub-societies whose members have already been heavily acquainted with the use of money but have been denied any coinage (ie. prisons). So instead of the financial activities being a shortcut for basic human experience which would otherwise be accomplished through barter, the barter narrative is itself secondary to and derived from the original financial activity it is trying to justify, and justifies nothing at all."

That's what virtual means: made out of information. Even in the case of physical money, its value is still virtual. The value of gold is (mostly) virtual; gold has some practical uses as a material, but that's not gold that's backing any currency. Money is a concept, and its value is virtual.

TrueReddit,3dr0hj,MrDannyOcean,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:47:30 2015 UTC,"Money is indeed a concept. But who has the right to 'expand its supply'? Central banks? Private banks? The question is how to make sure that this 'concept' (that helps people do value exchange) comes from a source that is credible, fair and reliable to guarantee an efficient, stable and fair exchange. I just think that private banks prefer to gamble instead of caring about the steadiness of the 'concept'. Even when we let central banks, in their current form as independent private entities, do the job, it still has many backlashes.  What I want to say is that economists must dare to challenge all the attributes and mechanisms of the current system to come up with more sustainable and inventive paradigms."

Our money is (as well you know) not backed by greenish bits of linen any more than it is backed by gold. Is there some enlightening part of fiscal policy I'm not understanding here? Money's value is debt. If I lend you my house, and we pretend the house is worth a billion dollars, I haven't manufactured a billion dollars, but I have created (between us) a debt of a billion dollars.  As for fiscal creativity, I'm all for exploring 'longer term and inventive paradigms'. My doubt is whether any non-fiat currency can prove efficient, stable, and fair.

""Steadiness"" could be replaced with something more descriptive. Try ""steady-state"" or ""mass adoption"". A sample correction would be ""The problem with complex systems is that once they reach mass adoption, they become too difficult to control and any changes become too risky.""   And in terms of complexity, ...   A better phrase for an introduction might be ""The most illustrative example of such a system is the modern banking system, with its baroque procedures and horrific complexity...""   This money creation process obeys to the fractional reserve banking system.   ""obeys to"" is rarely used in English.

The real problem is that a lot of jokes that are offending crowds are generally still making the butts of the jokes the people who get the short end of the stick instead of what comedians are historically really good at joking about, which is our sometimes ridiculous and equally stupid social structures that create these situations for which comedy is supposed to serve as an effective and comfortable lens of addressing our flaws and imperfections."

TrueReddit,3dp1m5,wutcnbrowndo4u,23,Sat Jul 18 11:53:41 2015 UTC,"While the article is fluff, the concept is interesting: why have we seen a dramatic rise in cultural intolerance? My belief is that this intolerance is a direct response to polarization.   Take gay rights. For 20 years, polarization was the name of the game. The internet gave those who didn't support gay rights a way to find each other and interact. Whole industries grew up to generate ""science"" to support those viewpoints, and mainstream media networks found it necessary to align with their base or die.   If you're a gay rights advocate, how do you combat that? Those with a polarized viewpoint want nothing more than debate and engagement, because it reinforces their existing belief.  One of the only effective ways to combat polarization is societal shame. Direct engagement (""you're an idiot"") doesn't work, but societal engagement (""your boss/neighbor/wife thinks you're a bigot"") can shame people into change. The trick is to sell the issue in a way society will accept.   Social media has allowed us to propagate information through the hive mind in a way that has never been seen before. The Confederate flag flew more than 50 years in S.C., yet it took only a few weeks for the cultural zeitgeist to shift.   It's a really interesting area of study. Looking forward to seeing what polarized issue (fat shaming? men's rights? vaccine avoiders?) will be next subjected to the laser of societal group intolerance."

TrueReddit,3dp1m5,potatoisafruit,2,Mon Jul 20 19:04:13 2015 UTC,"It is also a direct result of internet giving voice to the minorities.   Earlier, a transgender person would never ""come out"" simply because:  1) They have no idea what the response would be.  2) Due to so few transgender people being known, people had no knowledge about them and hence were phobic.  3) Phobic people further forced transgender people into seclusion.  This is in direct contrast to experience of racial minorities. It became a social taboo for a white person to call a black person the 'n-word' long before it became taboo to pick on most of the other invisible minorities.  Post giant community websites (reddit/tumblr/pinterest) more and more minorities are realizing that it's ok to speak up against prejudices and more and more 'majorities' are siding with them (and they repeatedly invoke the prejudices against racial minorities as a direct comparison).

TrueReddit,3dp1m5,pinkottah,28,Sat Jul 18 14:02:53 2015 UTC,"Of course the title is about a trans person.  Here is the summary: when you were young, you learned about men and women but you did not learn about transgender people at the same time.  Instead you learned about us places like comedy movies (Ace Ventura, the Hangover, ""you slept with a man!  yuk yuk yuk""), and talk shows like Maury or Jerry Springer (""turns out she's a man!  yuk yuk yuk"").  Or even if you saw some exposure where trans people were not the butt of the joke, it was still very primitive (how are your genitals doing?).  You learned that it is appropriate to call trans women ""men"", so you feel entitled to do that and you think it's funny, etc.  Chances are you got a very insulting introduction to trans people, whenever you first encountered us in life.  Maybe you saw one of us on the street and your parents said ""that's a he-she, a tranny, a man.""  At some point, you learned to hate us, laugh at us, pity us (and later you probably learned to jerk off to us, but that's another story).    So to really do this properly we have to rewind the clock.  Just as you were told that men and women are respectable people, you should have learned the same about trans women and trans men.  When you were told that women and girls are called ""she"", you should have been told that trans women are also called ""she.""  You should not have been told that trans women ""are men"", because thats an over simplification - we are trans women.      So Dave Chappelle, you are not participating in my self-image by calling me by female pronouns.  Rather you are correcting for your own ignorant upbringing.  It's just that you are of an age where learning something new is too painful.  You'd rather shut down and keep repeating what you learned as a kid: men, women, and laughing stocks for a comedy routine.  Teaching a kid that trans women are ""men"" is like teaching a kid that african people are animals (referring to past history centuries ago). That was considered to be a ""scientific"" view of the time.  Language is so powerful, that it not only is used to discuss the world but it also shapes the way we see concepts in the world.  I may have XY chromosomes, but that doesn't make it scientific for you to call me a man or refer to me as ""he"".  Everyone deserves respect, and it's time you update your language to follow through on that ideal."
TrueReddit,3dp1m5,iyzie,13,Sat Jul 18 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"I largely agree, but you also have to recognize how silly this sometimes gets. Asking for basic pronouns that reflect the gender after a transition isn't too much to ask, but there are lots of people who fall into a crazy k-hole of gender self-expression. They only want to be referred to as trans(asterisk), for example. I'm not excited about the asterisk, as an asterisk has a specific meaning (it means ""look at the bottom of the page for more info""), and it's not necessarily anything you wish to assign to it. I mean, you can assign another meaning, but if I don't want to play along with the new thing you made up, how upset should you reasonably be?  I get it, people are assigning gender labels to you that you don't agree with. But what about the non-binary genderqueer who is pissed that you didn't automatically know and use the preferred bespoke gender-neutral pronoun ""they""  or ""ou"" or ""zir"" or ""zhe"" or whatever crazy bullshit they pulled from old English or Esperanto or Elvish or Swahili or whatever? (And, no folks I didn't just make that pronoun list up, some people actually want you to use that and get pissed if you don't).   So the question of how much or little we should play along isn't always one of ignorance or lack of empathy. Some trans people get super pissed off if they think you have clocked them. But I'm not lacking empathy, I'm just not blind - some people can pass better than others. It doesn't mean I get to be rude, but again how much of your anger at me is reasonable for my correctly identifying you are trans and not cis gender male or female?   Define yourself all you want, but there has to be some limits to the expectations of others to follow your preferred thing."
TrueReddit,3dp1m5,watchitbub,6,Sat Jul 18 13:43:49 2015 UTC,"Just wondering though, have you ever actually met a non-binary genderqueer person in person who got upset because you used the wrong pronoun?   Because sure, some people might get upset on the internet, but I find that's either because a) they're a troll, or b) they're participating in an online community which maybe for the first time makes them feel normal, and in which they are the majority.  From my experience, if I mis-gender someone and use the wrong pronoun, they politely correct me (if they correct me at all), and I immediately apologize and use the correct pronouns."
TrueReddit,3dp1m5,immaculate_affection,9,Sat Jul 18 16:12:52 2015 UTC,"First of all, the asterisk has a longstanding meaning in computing and symbolic manipulation: it stands for a wildcard, a placeholder for any character.  This can be seen in windows search, for example.  If you search a folder for *.txt , it will match all the files that end in .txt .  So trans* is a sensible abbreviation for all of transgender, transsexual, trans woman, trans man, etc.    As for non-standard pronouns, my first question is whether you've met anyone in real life who asked you to use non-standard pronouns.  If not, isn't this kind of a straw man?  I've met a lot of non-binary people, because I've spent years of being involved with the trans community in US cities with large trans populations.  All the non-binary folks I've met are fine with being called ""they/them"", and the few who have asked to be called zir's and xim's made it a polite request, and will also accept they / them because they know it's much more realistic.  I get that its fun for some people to facepalm about teenagers on tumblr, or to point to a mentally unbalanced person who flips out at not being called ""zir"" (I bet you can't even find such people on tumblr), but don't blow this idle form of entertainment out of proportion and act like it is a major trend, or represents even a large part of the trans population.  As for clocking people, of course you can't help but to clock some of us some of the time.  But is there some reason you need to acknowledge it?  If you are calling attention to the fact that a person is trans, you are probably doing it wrong.      Define yourself all you want, but there has to be some limits to the expectations of others to follow your preferred thing.   Personally, I don't really see why.  My mind is flexible enough that I'll play whatever game people want to play, out of respect for that person - as long as its not hurting anyone else."
TrueReddit,3dp1m5,iyzie,5,Sat Jul 18 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"I actually did have people get pissed that I used ""she"" instead of ""they"" a few times when I worked in a gay bar. It happens in real life, no straw man needed. The other ones I've only seen in articles and whatnot, but some people are advocating for that, and very sharply. They also really exist. If trans people don't relate to what they are saying to define the trans community, they should call out that silliness because those people are way overrepresented in the trans dialogue relative to the actual number of trans people who seem to actually agree with that."
TrueReddit,3dp1m5,watchitbub,2,Sat Jul 18 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"Using ""she"" instead of ""they"" is different, because ""they"" is a standard word.  So you screwed up that person's reasonable request, and I can see why they were upset.  Just like I would be upset if someone called me ""he"" or ""they"" instead of ""she"".  Don't generalize that upsetedness to think it also applies to non-standard pronouns.  I don't really buy the point about over representation coming from within the trans community, again I think it is because of communities like TumblrInAction who make a hobby out of mocking people on the fringe of the trans community."
TrueReddit,3dp1m5,iyzie,3,Sat Jul 18 16:55:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but again ""they"" has a standard meaning - it refers to multiple people. This was a situation of one person standing in front of me, clearly irritated that I didn't guess ""she"" preferred to be a ""they"". It's not a my mistake it's (i guess) their mistake for expecting that as anyone's default.   And if this was a one-off then fine, it's one person overreacting. But it happened a few times, and they all seemed to think the burden was on the rest of the world to know their preferred pronouns. Being trans seems to be pretty rough compared to a lot of other things, but it creates a lot of over sensitivity and the kind of expectations that come with living in the bubble of your own personal experience."
TrueReddit,3dp1m5,watchitbub,2,Sat Jul 18 17:01:42 2015 UTC,"It sounds pretty unreasonable for them to get upset at you not being psychic enough to know that they prefer 'they"".  Granted, I've learned to use ""they"" for any gender non-conforming people  whose pronouns I don't know yet.  It doesn't really hurt me to do so.    Your point about the standard of meaning of ""they"" is only half true.  It is also standard to use ""they"" in a gender neutral way.  Check out definition 3 of ""they""."

I certainly don't have a problem whatsoever with trans people, not at all. But I noticed the other day, in a thread about Caitlyn Jenner, how quickly everyone had switched to calling her ""Caitlyn"" and ""she"" and ""her"". Which is obviously great that society has come this far this fast, at least in more liberal areas like Reddit  But part of me, deep inside, felt like something was hanging in the air, that there was an elephant in the room and everyone was just trying so hard to not look at it or talk to it.   Perhaps it's immature or mean...but sometimes you get a fleeting feeling that everyone is sharing this, I dunno, hallucination, and it all feels a little absurd sometimes.   I know how that comes across, believe me I do, but I am just being honest and I can see how someone like a comedian, who has very strong opinions and views on the world, could find it hard to ignore the obvious and play along."
TrueReddit,3dp1m5,Bingo-Bango-Bong-o,5,Sun Jul 19 19:26:49 2015 UTC,"I know all about the elephant in the room.  When I came out, after talking in person with my direct supervisor I sent an email to the 30 or so people I work with on a regular basis.  That email got zero replies.  keep in mind, my appearance had changed drastically in the last year and although I continued wearing male clothes, it had been pretty obvious for a while that I was changing my gender (most strangers were calling me ""she"" without prompting at that point).    I came to work the next day, presenting fully female, and everyone called me by my new name and pronouns.  Or at least tried to.  But nobody stopped to actually talk about it, they acted like nothing happened.  The big question on my mind is, how do they feel about it?  But those conversations never happened.  For the first couple months I felt like I was dying of shame.  I'm sitting there in women's clothes, but everyone thinks I look like a confused man.  I could barely work, every 5 minutes I looked at the big glass window and wanted to jump out of it.  Not because I regretted my change, but because everyone pretending like nothing had happened made me feel like I was left in the dark - what are they really thinking?  I felt like they were embarassed of me, or maybe even hated me for this burden I gave them of calling me ""she"".  My friends in the trans community told me to give it 6 months, that things would get better.  They were right.  The memory of my male persona faded from my mind, and I could tell it faded somewhat from other's minds too.  They started getting more comfortable around me again, and resumed inviting me to lunch or to drinks after work, etc.  They resumed making eye contact, smiling at me, and got to the point of using my new name and pronouns without looking like it was a huge mental burden.  Even more time passed, and some old people left the work place and new ones joined, and the new people had an even easier time accepting me: maybe they knew I'm trans, but they only ever met me as a woman so it was easier for them to call me ""she"".   So anyway, I know that the elephant in the room is really tough to deal with.  And I am sorry for inflincting that distraction on the people in my life, I was patient and I did the best I could at being a woman to try and make it easier.  Ultimately I inflicted this on people because I had no choice, I had to transition to make my life worth living, to have a future I wanted to live to see.  So in the case of Caitlyn, she has only been out for less than two months  (counting time since the vanity fair cover, since she was still bruce for the dianne sawyer interview).  The memory of bruce is still very fresh, and it takes a mental effort to remember to call her caitlyn and ""she.""   I feel the same way as all the rest of you.  She has been a celebrity since before I was born, so we have a lot of memories of bruce and it may take a long time for those memories to fade and to really naturally think of her as caitlyn.  But based on my experience, it will eventually become natural.  Fake it until you make it - it's healthy for our brains to learn something new."

For it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all.""    H. L. Mencken"
TrueReddit,3dp1m5,apjak,-1,Sat Jul 18 06:15:52 2015 UTC,"I don't buy it. The only reason that Mencken quote has any currency is because it's a cute counter-intuitive thing to say. There are plenty of scoundrels out there who are far from victims on the human freedom scale, in fact scoundrels are usually the ones proposing and enforcing oppression. I wouldn't mind seeing the ""defend to the death your right to say it"" folks using their own freedom to take a positive stand against these agreed-upon evils like racism or sexism instead of ducking into the meta-conversation whenever confronted with them.  Another thing I dislike about that quote is the assumption that the only way to curb oppression is to keep it from beginning. Granted, that's when it's easiest and Mencken was all about pithiness, but it seems a rather conservative interpretation of things, like the oppressions of the status quo are immutably The Way Things Are and that reform is the true enemy."
TrueReddit,3dp1m5,sammythemc,34,Sat Jul 18 08:02:11 2015 UTC,"You don't buy it because you don't get the idea. The idea is to push back against the natural will of people to oppress others. It's unlikely in the next few thousands years to ever exist a time of true freedom™ where society is free from all forms of oppression, including punishment. But it's more likely that if care is not taken society goes back to being less free than it is today. As such, you have to take an ideological stance that makes sense. The ideological stance that makes sense in order to push back against the more likely situation (of going back to a considerably less free society, one we had only a few hundred years ago) is one that pushes forward in an almost naive way. As such, the general idea that oppressing people in any form is a bad thing is a reasonable stance to take and is a stance shows one way of progress for society.  You might take issue with the statement that it's the way of progress, but consider this: are people more willing to contribute to society if they are restricted in what they can do and how they can act or are they more likely to produce value if they are relatively free to choose their own path and act as they think is best? I think the second is true. We need to be able to feel in control of our lives, and the moment we don't is when we feel frustration and when resort to bad behavior. In a society where everyone has freedom to do what they want, most people will act in a nice manner. The Internet is some proof of this. Are there bad people abusing it and trying to ruin it in various ways? Yes. But most people aren't and everything on the Internet mostly works and it has provided immense value to society so far. The point is that most people are genuinely good and under the correct circumstances they are valuable, so the ideal stance to take is one that pushes towards a world that allows more correct circumstances to occur, and oppressing people is generally not the way to achieve this."

There's always going to be a little ""oppression"" in terms of limiting behavior and speech, and it doesn't have to come from a central authority to be effective. Is taxing a rich person so a poor person can go to college an increase in the freedom to choose one's own path or a decrease? Similarly to how the poor person might see ""freedom"" in that instance differently than the rich person, how do you think black people or women feel about the openness of reddit's dialogue?

I think you're absolutely right, but, as one of the aforementioned ""free speech absolutists"", I feel we shouldn't limit people's access or ability to express unpopular or even vile views and opinions in a forum like this. Reddit seems to have found itself in a unique position in regard to free speech and the immense boon of interconnectivity and connection the internet provides. Like it or not, Reddit seems to have become the best public venue for people to come and honestly share their thoughts and ideas. It seems to have the right mix of anonymity and accountability to where you're free to express your true opinions and ideas without social repercussions of people knowing your true identity thus yielding more frankness and interaction of opposing viewpoints than Facebook. Yet having a profile and account history on Reddit tends to breed more sincerity than in a place like 4chan. Limiting anyone's ability to express an opinion here would be tragic to me. It would prevent someone's thoughts from potentially evolving either through affirmation with like-minded people or through criticism and correction from an opposing school of thought. If anyone is to grow intellectually, they need access to a broad range of perspectives, good and bad.  Obviously, this adherence to free speech as a principle doesn't result in a utopia: many people have stubborn, hateful views, emotions often run high, and often like-minded people tend to form echo-chambers on the internet where groupthink and positive feedback only entrench their perspectives. We see this with any social network: Facebook, Twitter; and Reddit is no exception. But as Reddit is currently structured, I think it provides the best chance at approaching an intellectual environment as described above where people hear a litany of different ideas, arguments, and perspectives, and, though they may not agree with them, in understanding their origins, these people can nurture a textured, nuanced, and well-considered, argued opinion/idea on a given issue. If we have to put up with some ignorant, hateful bullshit in the process for the sake of a fraction of those hateful bullshitters becoming less hateful, I think it's worth it1 ; at the end of the day, if the worst you've suffered is having to read some repulsive words on a screen, it's a small price to pay.  That's just my 2 cents. Obviously people disagree, and that's their right. But I tend to sympathize with that Mencken quote. I end up defending the rights of people who I think are morally in the wrong more often than I care to (and it's not that often, really. Most people are genuinely good). But as long as they are not responsible for having done anything to explicitly violate another's civil rights, their rights should be protected as well.  1 - Comment/edit here: obviously no one has to agree with ideas they deem shitty; there are many ways a community can discourage speech they disagree with without banning it wholesale across a forum: mockery, dissent, putting them down. on Reddit there ar downvotes, or just ignoring them. You don't have to endorse/agree with someone's views, but you should respect their fundamental ability to say it with the knowledge that you can say whatever you want in response."

I'm not trying to call you out specifically cause I think your general message is fine but since you used the phrase I'd like to share some thoughts I've been mulling over about the phrase ""choosing your battles"". Basically I've come to think that it's a suggestion that is only useful to people with ___ privilege. For example, when you have cis privilege you can indeed ""choose your battles"" when it comes to transphobia. You can look out on the world and decide which fights you want to jump in and help fight, do a cost/benefit analysis and only fight where it seems worth it. If you are trans, however, you don't get to choose those battles in the same way—the battles are brought to you. They would be more accurately termed invasions or attacks. You can't opt-out of that battle someone already decided to bring it to you by saying or doing something hateful. The best you can do is choosing to fight, surrender or retreat. Having a choice of whether or not to become involved is a fundamental part of privilege because people without that privilege are involved simply by virtue of existing."

The real problem is that a lot of jokes that are offending crowds are generally still making the butts of the jokes the people who get the short end of the stick instead of what comedians are historically really good at joking about, which is our sometimes ridiculous and equally stupid social structures that create these situations for which comedy is supposed to serve as an effective and comfortable lens of addressing our flaws and imperfections."

In an all-or nothing refusal climate, you can either serve both the Westboro Baptist Church and gays, or neither... which eventually excludes everyone who've made their views, orientation, lifestyle or anything else known. In a selective refusal climate, whoever has the support of the majority/political climate can be served (let's say gays in this example) and anyone vocally opposed (say, the WBC) can be refused. And that can be applied to both local and national (even international) levels.  On what grounds someone can refuse to do service/do business with someone? If any form of refusal is allowed, then this polarizes society to the black/white segregation the US had in the past. /u/watchitbub's gay farmer might have to go to a pro-gay backhoe lender (that just sounds wrong), whereas the anti-gay farmers might have to find an anti-gay farming outlet for their supplies.

We're not advocating violence against gays and lesbians — far from it. We're not going to invade your bedrooms and toss your same-sex partners in prison.

Wives are no longer considered servile to the husband. So on and so forth. Incredibly few Christians today marry and conduct a marriage as prescribed a literal reading of the Bible. And if we're not reading the Bible literally, then there's no statement concerning gay marriage in the bible.  What religious people approve or disapprove of also affects others when they try to influence politics - he supports gay marriage, I would never vote for him.

TrueReddit,3dlzcx,quantum-mechanic,64,Fri Jul 17 12:26:58 2015 UTC,"Please see my response to u/truth1465 . If higher pay did actually offset the protections of being an employee, then this would be a fair tradeoff. However many ""independent contractors"" hired by Uber and other sharing services aren't really anything of the sort, and they don't make the extra pay that justifies the tradeoff.  It's also often really hard to judge the actual costs of the benefits you're giving up. With driver's insurance, for example, it is much cheaper for a centralized company to pay for a large number of drivers than an individual driver to pay on their own. (We aren't really seeing the effects of that yet because insurers still don't actually insure individual drivers for commercial passenger vehicles, which many Uber drivers find out the hard way when they get in an accident.) The same logic works with retirement funds and health plans -- the cost that the company would pay is much less than what you as an individual pay, so even if they pay you more dollar-for-dollar, you're still losing out. The short of it being that slightly higher pay can be an appealing form of instant gratification, but it doesn't easily make up for the long-term value you're trading in.  So yes, while it would be ideal to have more freedom and higher pay, at the expense of fewer benefits, it seems as though a lot of VCs and tech startups are capitalizing on workers' desire for that ideal in order to cut them a very raw deal. Uber for instance has spun being a driver as ""like owning your own business,"" to entice enterprising young individuals, but it's really nothing of the sort. If you own your own business, you can't get fired for getting a low customer service rating or speaking out against one of your ""clients."""

There are many positions that NEED a certain schedule because they depend on others for some portion of their job.

Then you're not only stuck paying for the damage -- you probably won't be able to find someone else to insure you and you'll be permanently off the road, or you'll at least be paying MUCH higher premiums. Plus the passenger can sue you and you will have to pay the legal costs yourself. (And let's not even talk about how bad it could get if you're actually at fault.)  As much as I see the appeal of that freedom, you really have to appreciate that you're in a pretty tenuous position without some basic job protections. If something goes wrong on the job, Uber does not have your back, and you can't actually afford to cover your own because you don't actually have a real business. Most independent contractors have those kinds of protections, but they aren't offered as part of the ""sharing economy"" -- which is why it seems like Uber drivers and AirBnBers homesharers are not really independent contractors at all. It's also part of why at least one state court has ruled that they actually aren't."
TrueReddit,3dlzcx,omniclast,84,Fri Jul 17 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed.

Insurance companies do not offer commercial passenger insurance or hotel insurance to private contractors, and certainly will never do so at the rates they offer to large hotel chains and taxi companies because the economics would never work. In most cases if an Uber driver gets in an accident, and the insurer finds out they were driving for Uber, it will yank their insurance (which will also cost them their job since Uber will just dismiss them for not having insurance).   Ironically the solution is probably for Uber drivers to form an independent contractors union, which could allow for collective insurance (as well as negotiate for higher wages, something independent contractors that work for AirBnB and Uber have no power to do on their own). A couple of Uber drivers in LA are actually trying to do that, but a lot of full time drivers are too scared to join because Uber can just fire them without cause.

But I guess the other way to interpret your point is that there's no way any union would be able to cajole better contracts out of Uber since it plans to get rid of them all anyways.

At the moment we are a very long way from an economy that can support a large population that is not part of the labour force. For the time being the drivers who will be put out of work by autonomous cars will need to retrain or find unskilled labour in other markets; not working is clearly not an option for them.  Ideally in the long term we will hit zero marginal cost and at some point adopt a universal basic income to support the unemployed majority of the population. But I think that will require a massive cultural shift as well as a technological one, which will likely take generations. So long as the attitude that U.S. majority has toward work and social supports remains in place, I can't see any way that universal income could be a reality in for our generation. In the interim it will still be very important for workers to fight for fair treatment from the companies they rely on to support them, including Uber."

I can't buy health insurance across state lines because it's illegal. This law is in place to insulate insurance companies from competition from outside the state. In any other case we are allowed to buy stuff across state lines. The most notable being buying stuff from amazon and ebay.   Another government law prevents companies and individuals from bulk importing drugs. This once again insulates companies from outside competition.   In Arizona a new law passed that allows anybody to order their own tests without doctor involvement. Thanks to this law, testing companies like Theranos can now charge 50-80% less.   The Surgery Center of Oklahoma offers no-insurance, flat-priced common operations where the price is known before the procedure is undertaken and typically winds up costing 80% less than a hospital charges for the same procedure. How are they able to do this? Since they don't deal with Medicare and health insurance, they don't have to deal with the high price controls set by these organizations."

Sure you can look up the normal ranges online and compare them to yours if you're smart enough. But good luck interpreting your own chest X-ray or knowing whether to test for MRSA or candida in your biopsy without a medical education of some kind.  Really I think the best solution to the price problem is not to remove the healthcare workers from healthcare. It is to give the patients more bargaining power to leverage against the healthcare system - and this can only be done by aggregating the patients, whether into insurance pools, a government-supplied bargaining pool, or a single payer system."

I happen to work for a company that employs a lot of freelance writers, and reliability is a huge problem-- even if we can get someone with strong qualifications, we still can't really control whether their work comes in on time or what quality it is, and that's a very expensive risk in our business.

Soon, by the time a company acquires a startup, the innovation they bought will be outdated.  More than likely, most things will become opensource and will be continually updated and improved from people all over the world. Companies will not be able to own these opensource products because if they try to take it, people will just clone the project and continue working on it elsewhere.

I'm not trying to disagree with you, just in the last two words, then I'm building on your argument. The take away I get from the essay is that these sharing business models could be in a race to the bottom, the way music apps have gone. (this is my own observation here) from Pandora, turntable, to Spotify etc these apps find creative ways for people to listen to new music for free and each one succeeds at the expense of the last if customers get more for less. So the best one will be one where it's the best and free. Look at tinder compared to other dating apps.   Getting rid of the middle man is the pattern here, using technology. So how much of the essay is accurate? Does all this extrapolate to backyard farming where people can get their food locally grown without going through a corporation? What would our civilization look like with all these innovations? I think it would be marked by a huge class divide; people with the self-driving cars, nice houses, etc would be able to not work. The rest would have to come up with money somehow. And we're back to the political question of welfare and wealth redistribution. Let's assume the author is suggesting that we get past that political point (a big what if), and will be where Scandinavian countries are now. Would that combined with the sharing economy be a success and would it take off? I guess this is where the prediction falls apart."

TrueReddit,3dlzcx,basilwhite,119,Fri Jul 17 14:44:52 2015 UTC,"For anyone who found this article as painful to read as I did: the same thesis has been developed, and better said, in ""The Economics of Star Trek"" by Rick Webb.   The problem with the OP is that the author's thesis gets diluted by a jumble of over-generalizations, tossed together like a garden salad.  For example, talking about how countries in what I presume are Europe and US handled the recession since 2008:   The solutions have been austerity plus monetary excess. But they are not working. In the worst-hit countries, the pension system has been destroyed, the retirement age is being hiked to 70, and education is being privatised so that graduates now face a lifetime of high debt. Services are being dismantled and infrastructure projects put on hold.   That reads like all those things are happening at once, and in the same place, somewhere.  Where?  I want to know, in which country has the result of the recession been all of the following:    the pension system has been destroyed the retirement age is being hiked to 70  education is being privatised  graduates now face a lifetime of high debt  services are being dismantled  infrastructure projects put on hold   For example, not even in US, famous for its expensive universities, can it be truly said that ""graduated now face a lifetime of high debt"".  Some few might;  Most don't.  Three out of ten students graduate college with no debt. For those who do, the average college debt is around $30,000 (source), hardly ""a lifetime of high debt"".   Some of the arguments are done purely for pathos, and don't stand up to analysis.  For example:   Information is a machine for grinding the price of things lower and slashing the work time needed to support life on the planet. As a result, large parts of the business class have become neo-luddites. Faced with the possibility of creating gene-sequencing labs, they instead start coffee shops, nail bars and contract cleaning firms: the banking system, the planning system and late neoliberal culture reward above all the creator of low-value, long-hours jobs.   The ""neo-luddites"" term has negative connotation; the purpose of this argument is to show how reactionary most of the business-class is to this threat of free-flowing information.  But is a gene-sequencing lab really comparable to a coffee shop?  The former requires lots of startup investment and narrow expertise, and it's not clear what the demand is and what the profits will be.  Meanwhile, a coffee shop needs but a small fraction of startup investment, expertise needed is much more readily available, and it's much easier to gauge the demand.  Besides, as Matt Nassim Nicholas Taleb pointed out in ""The Black Swan"", if you want to guarantee yourself a steady if modest income, don't go for the jobs where the lucky few strike gold while the majority toil in obscurity.  That is, go for jobs that are not scalable: even the best doctors can serve only so many patients, while the best authors can be read by billions.  Furthermore, the author uses obscure terminology that covers up familiar activities, making it seem that what has been happening in the past decade is somehow brand-new.  For example:   You only find this new economy if you look hard for it. In Greece, when a grassroots NGO mapped the country’s food co-ops, alternative producers, parallel currencies and local exchange systems they found more than 70 substantive projects and hundreds of smaller initiatives ranging from squats to carpools to free kindergartens. To mainstream economics such things seem barely to qualify as economic activity – but that’s the point. They exist because they trade, however haltingly and inefficiently, in the currency of postcapitalism: free time, networked activity and free stuff.   ""Networked activity"", like carpooling to work and leaving your kids with the neighbors.  That's neither new nor unusual.  What is new and unusual is that more people with middle-class incomes could forego such ""networked activity"".  (Edit: word and name.)"

Corporations always make themselves look so professional, and make things look like you need super-fancy equipment and shit. But it isnt always actually so. For instance, software and 3d printing.   By building business models and share valuations based on the capture and privatisation of all socially produced information, such firms are constructing a fragile corporate edifice at odds with the most basic need of humanity, which is to use ideas freely.   Yeah, it could be the other way around. The companies clearly try to block such free use of ideas. And with use of twitter etcetera, the control of opinion is potentially also  more fine grained. They can literally control the lists that are news sources. And they know more about the readers.  Hell, wikipedia relies on sources with some authority, even though they're often extensively biassed.. I guess there is quite a lot of variety, perhaps enough, and i dont know an alternative. All this shit could be used to make a convincing ""reality"" just like media control does.  I also wonder, at what point does capitalism lose its capital? How can things separate themselves from capitalism without getting un-owned. That is the bloody problem with privatization, of course. It is one-way to getting even more power to capitalists.

TrueReddit,3dlzcx,meltmybrain,10,Fri Jul 17 17:30:48 2015 UTC,"You are right, it's Nassim Nicholas Taleb.  And I misspelled ""scalable"".  My brain-fart.    His point on scalable jobs, roughly, was as follows.  An event is scalable if it's just as likely to gain a percent increase, no matter its current size.  Wars are like that--it's just as likely for a skirmish to kill 1% more people than it already has as it is for a world war.  Music record sales are like that: it's just as likely for a small hipster band to get 1% more listeners as it is for a popular boy band.  Live music performances aren't like that; if the venue is sold out, it's sold out.  A scalable job is one where, no matter how much you are currently earning, it's just as likely that you can make 1% more.  The distribution of scalable events follows what is known as the 80-20 rule: 20% of the events account for 80% of the amount (e.g., 20% of battles account for 80% of battle deaths).  So it's not always 80% and 20%, but it's always ""x close to 100%"" and ""y close to 0%"".    And that's where the issue lies with scalable jobs: there are a few huge winners, while the overwhelming majority get next to nothing.  So going into such a job is a dreamer's folly: it's the kids who practice basketball, dreaming of the NBA; it's the teenage girls starving themselves, hoping to make it as a runway model.  Top basketball players and top runway models have fame and fortune.  The overwhelming majority get a raw deal."

One of the consequences is that capital gains tax primarily affects the 1%, while income tax primarily affects the 99%.

Any accident, glitch, or manufacturing error has huge potential for lethality and destruction dwarfing that of ground vehicles.

Clean energy would be an unlikely option considering the amount of power needed to maintain flight for an object that heavy with the necessary fine control manipulation.

I'd be very intetested to know if his book defines capitalism, because he seems to infer the definition that suits his argument. For example, I'd say the defining feature of capitalism is private ownership and freedom to transact without interference. Seen this way all these 'postcapitalist' developments such as uber and airbnb are definitely capitalist. Information technology has simply enabled better use of individual's personal and human capital. Certainly, if you read free market economists like Ludwig Von Mises and FA Hayek the underlying principles they identify in capitalist economies exactly match up to the sorts of things we are seeing now. This is probably because their underlying principle is one of individual freedom, and technology is increasingly enabling people to transact freely without state interference. So, it looks like Paul's post capitalist theory is in many ways misinterpreting the direction of travel. If capitalism means freedom and private ownership we are moving to a re-capitalist society.

When means of production and surplus value is dictated by the top (as in capitalism), you don't end up with a friendly brotherhood of equality and liberty, you end up with wage slavery and enormous inequality, where workers are marginalized and alienated."

'Second, information is corroding the market’s ability to form prices correctly. That is because markets are based on scarcity while information is abundant. The system’s defence mechanism is to form monopolies – the giant tech companies – on a scale not seen in the past 200 years, yet they cannot last. By building business models and share valuations based on the capture and privatisation of all socially produced information, such firms are constructing a fragile corporate edifice at odds with the most basic need of humanity, which is to use ideas freely.'"
TrueReddit,3dlzcx,fuckCalhoun,33,Fri Jul 17 12:48:49 2015 UTC,information is corroding the market’s ability to form prices correctly.   Wat? The whole point is that prices are supposed to convey information about the relative value and scarcity of goods and resources. Feeding more information into the system means that prices will more accurately reflect the value and scarcity of whatever is being priced.   That's a pretty atrocious statement by the author.

Is it possible for a company's long term plan to seriously include encouraging this sort of freewheeling individual-centered neovu-economy? If it is, can a majority of companies all think this way?   Something else to consider - if we supplant a large portion of traditional production with home production, will we be able to support the displaced labor? It takes a certain aptitude to take advantage of these technologies (even if ""taking advantage of"" ends up meaning ""using the newly found free time to create something entirely different that you couldn't do before""), and there will always be people willing to work but unable to figure out how to make these things work well enough for them that they can sustain themselves that way. I think that this is a distinct question from the one that arrises from the automation of traditional production, both because the location of production is moved and because home production methods aren't necessarily automated in the same way. Will we force more people into hard labor? Will we get more artists? Will traditional production still exist at the same level, now only creating these specialist products that you can't build at home? Will warranties and customer support become demanded enough in their own right that companies will start to center themselves around them rather then using them as just another line in the feature section?

If they are answerable to the public, then they have to be seen to be able to secure convictions, instead of them being answerable to the idea of justice itself.  If they are always trying to convince the public that they are tough, it removes the motivation to see justice done, in order to curry public favour.

What the author should have done is argued that inequality is growing, because of the usual suspects (automatization, globalization, college debt & star player effects). These keep down wages and impede the ability of citizens to build wealth or gain the skills needed at exactly the right time. Dealing with these challenges means, society can't afford to have more dumb people, because they will worsen the trend and we'll end up in a cyberpunk dystopia.

Let's suppose for a moment that IQ really is a thing. When I clicked the link I was hoping for an article that showed that the 21st century requires a highly intelligent workforce that will lift anyone towards a better life, regardless of other categories (including inequality at birth). I find that hypothesis to be at least plausible.  Instead I started seeing references to Charles Murray and nonsense about Human Biodiversity and realized it's basically a racist screed."

TrueReddit,3dqe7j,Fremen13,13,Sat Jul 18 13:01:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah.....I studied econometrics and this is a classic case of correlation vs. causation.    Basically the argument is that because an IQ proxy (which is a horrible measure of intelligence in objective terms) is correlated with educational outcomes that it is somehow casual.    Econometrics and statistics teach us how to differentiate and assign causality and when you apply analyzing rigorous analysis to this problem you find similar results BUT parental income and socioeconomic status cause a much bigger variation than any other factor period.  Additionally,  IQ tests and SATs are super biased towards people with high incomes and parents that stress educational outcomes even though they are supposed to be measured of intelligence.   This whole argument is based on really flawed analysis that doesn't accurately distinguish between correlation and causation and IMO is essentially just justification of racism and xenophobia.    We have proven time and again that programs like the EITC and SNAP increased educational outcomes,  long term earnings and psychological well being as well as the flawed measures of IQ this article uses.   If it was really some inherent/genetically predetermined factor causing different educational outcomes then progressive programs wouldn't have even close to the positive effect that they do."

TrueReddit,3dqe7j,Schlagv,2,Sat Jul 18 14:45:09 2015 UTC,"I won't comment the article, but your comment.  IQs are much more than just social reproduction through social life.  Many methods have been used. Twin studies (variation between true and false twins) have shown the inherited part of many many psychological features, from autism to IQ. Adoption at birth from a poor to a wealthy family doesn't compensate and the adopted children still have a much worse IQ despite being well educated.  Now, some say ""but there is prenatal epigenetics!"" ... If even a giant social push like adoption at birth to a perfect family cannot compensate and you need to do this for several generations to remove epigenetic influence, the issue is just the same.  Denying intelligence is just crazy. I studied science in the French elite ""prepas"", most of us were from upper middle class backgrounds and selected on math/physics skill only. Even with this you could just see a huge gap between those who were on the top and the least brilliant ones. And the poorest were not the worst ones. Education and family were not the issue. Work and motivation were not the issue. Some of us were just smarter, a lot smarter for the first of the class."
TrueReddit,3dqe7j,Fremen13,2,Sat Jul 18 19:20:54 2015 UTC,"My argument isn't that IQ plays no role at all, but econometrics/statistics is all about figuring out which independent variables affect the dependent variable the most and from applying those fields to this issue shows that while IQ and SAT scores play a role, the biggest percentage of variation in success/income/life outcomes is due to your parental income/socioeconomic class/status.    Additionally you don't respond at all to my argument using the evidence from EITC and SNAP programs that show insane increases in educational attainment and wouldn't if IQ was a main determinant in success.   I'm not saying it's not there, just that it is irrelevant compared to other causes when you look at the statistics.    Also, your argument has always been true for the exceptionally smart, but why do you think the 10 or 100 smartest people in the world are representative in any way of the general population?  That's just straight anecdote and doesn't really make any difference when we're talking about socially determined definitions of success."
TrueReddit,3dqe7j,Schlagv,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:40:51 2015 UTC,"I was speaking of selective higher education because it removes the social class issues as you mostly have either upper middle class people or middle class people with great parents.  I don't know about EITC and SNAP, but what I remember is that early education intensive help experiements increase reading skills significantly, but once the program stops, the grades falls and by the time they get out of high school it doesn't make any difference on SAT or dropout rate.  Also, the most extreme social program you can imagine, adoption at birth, doesn't make such a big difference despite being sustained and comprehensive. So I am not against those. I just say that differences are much bigger than what any social programs can do.  And when you say that parental social class is the most important, I also read the opposite: if you are born in median income family with bottom 20% IQ, you are likely to end up below the poverty line. If you are born below the poverty line but have a median IQ you are likely to earn more than poverty line. The thing is, the large part of the low income parents also get low IQ children and median income families also get median IQ children. So IQ is more important than social class.  I take those arguments from the The Bell Curve. The book has been criticised for making unconfortable conclusions, not for having false data."
TrueReddit,3dmr2q,HisLordAlmighty,2,Fri Jul 17 15:09:39 2015 UTC,"Vox interviews  Aaron Stein, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at the Royal United Services Institute, in order to make sense of the technical details of the Iran Nuclear Deal. In terms of non-proliferation, Stein views the deal as very robust, citing the unprecedented amount of oversight given to the IAEA for inspection and accounting purposes. According to stein, if Iran tries to build a bomb under this agreement, ""the likelihood of getting caught is near 100 percent."" As a result, ""it makes the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon in the next 25 years extremely remote."""
TrueReddit,3dmr2q,tinlizzey12,8,Fri Jul 17 15:16:12 2015 UTC,"There was actually never any actual evidence of any nuclear weapons program in Iran, ever.  Iran's nuclear program is in fact legal http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace  The ""Iranian nuclear threat"" was always just another exagerrated pretext to pressure the regime in the hopes of toppling it, as was ""WMDs in Iraq"" -- in fact the policy was brought to you by the very same Bush administration people who continued to serve in the first Obama admin. (read up on Dennis Ross)  Iran's nuclear program, which started at the encouragement of the US, for justifiable economic reasons despite Iran having oil http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3983-2005Mar26.html  http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/14/opinion/14iht-edsahimi_ed3_.html  was in fact quite legal. http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace  Nevertheless, Iran had historically been making significant compromise offers on its nuclear program, that the US ignored or even actively killed off, in order to prevent a peaceful resolution and to keep the ""Iranian nuclear threat"" alive.  http://news.antiwar.com/2011/04/20/elbaradei-us-europe-werent-interested-in-compromise-with-iran/  http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/opinion/05iht-edzarif.html?_r=0  These offers were either ignored or even actively undermined  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/17/AR2006061700727.html  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10007603/Iran-how-the-West-missed-a-chance-to-make-peace-with-Tehran.html  Even in the first Obama administration, Iran agreed to the terms of a deal negotiated on behalf of the US by Brazil and Turkey according to which Iran would have exported its enriched uranium in the hopes of receiving the reactor fuel it had been denied, only to see the Obama administration pull the rug out from under them AFTER Iran had said yes, upsetting the Brazilians and Turks so much they publicized the letter Obama had written to them just a week earlier endorsing the same terms that Iran had agreed to http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_brazil-reveals-obama-letter-in-spat-over-iran-nuclear-deal_211443.html  The Bush administration had started out imposing  an unrealistic and illegal demand called ""Zero Enrichment"" -http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/10/24/2823381/hawks-enrichment-war-iran/ - which would have required Iran to give up her sovereign right as recognized by the NonProliferation Treaty to be able to make their own reactor fuel (which thanks to US sanctions, Iran was not able to import as usual.) This was a deliberate policy of the Bush admin, to prevent any deal by making demands that no country would accept.  The second Obama admin eventually dropped the zero enrichment demand, and signaled that it is willing to resolve the nuclear issue, which is what we're seeing today. The significance of this is not in the details of the nuclear deal itself, but in that the US and Iran are finding ways to get along rather than continuing towards a conflict.  That's why there are many forces opposed to such a deal and insist that the US and Iran should not be talking but that the US should be attacking Iran instead, including Israel and the proIsraeli lobby in the US which has been pushing for a war for a while now.http://www.uscatholic.org/culture/war-and-peace/2008/06/iran-spam  There are others who say that the US should not listen to the Israelis and should instead ""Go to Iran"" just as Nixon ""went to China"" and decided to open up relations with those countries rather than continue the emnity. http://www.amazon.com/Going-Tehran-America-Islamic-Republic/dp/1250043530  So you see the nuclear issue is not really about nukes but is just a part of a larger political dispute. There are no Iranian nukes just as there were no Iraqi WMDs In reality, Iran's ""capability"" to make nukes is hardly unique -- 40 nations were already capable of quickly making nukes if they wanted to, back 10 years ago. More now, presumably. http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html  That's because the ""capability"" to make nukes comes with becoming technologically developed, not because these 40 nations want to make nukes. If you listen carefully you'd see that even the US only accuses Iran of ""intending to acquire the capability"" to make nukes, not actually making nukes. There is a significant difference: the capability to make nukes is not illegal. In fACT the NonProliferation Treaty is actually also intended to promote nuclear technology (which has to be shared ""to the fullest extent possible"" and ""without discrimination"")  -- thus having the ""capability"" to make nukes is not a violation of the NPT but actually an inevitable part of following the NPT.Nukes are actually more of a liability than an asset  There's no reason to just assume that Iran wants nukes either. http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ten-reasons-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb-7802  There's zero evidence of any Iranian nuclear weapons program, ever.   Despite growing international concern about Iran's nuclear program and its regional ambitions, most U.S. intelligence shared with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency has proved inaccurate, and none has led to significant discoveries inside Iran, diplomats here said. http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Most-U-S-tips-fingering-Iran-false-envoys-2646358.php   According to IAEA Director Elbaradei:   I have been making it very clear that with regard to these alleged studies, we have not seen any use of nuclear material, we have not received any information that Iran has manufactured any part of a nuclear weapon or component. That’s why I say, to present the Iran threat as imminent is hype. http://svaradarajan.blogspot.com/2009/10/elbaradei-interview-language-of-force.html   And   With respect to a recent media report, the IAEA reiterates that it has no concrete proof that there is or has been a nuclear weapon programme in Iran. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-sb-idUSTRE58G60W20090917   and   The IAEA is not making any judgment at all whether Iran even had weaponisation studies before because there is a major question of authenticity of the documents. http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article28114.ece   Even the new, US-backed IAEA Director   The incoming head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Friday he did not see any hard evidence Iran was trying to gain the ability to develop nuclear arms. ""I don't see any evidence in IAEA official documents about this,"" Yukiya Amano told Reuters in his first direct comment on Iran's atomic program since his election, when asked whether he believed Tehran was seeking nuclear weapons capability. http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/03/us-nuclear-iaea-iran-exclusive-idUSL312024420090703   and lets remember that Iran has bent over backwards and has actually allowed more inspections than legally required   ""Any country, I think, would be rather reluctant to let international inspectors to go anywhere in a military site,"" Mr. Blix told Al Jazeera English about Parchin in late March. ""In a way, the Iranians have been more open than most other countries would be."" http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0420/Iran-s-Parchin-complex-Why-are-nuclear-inspectors-so-focused-on-it   Claims that Iran blocked legally-required inspections were denied by even the IAEA http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/11/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSKRA15680720070511  So lets see, that's ELBaradei, Blix, and even Amano (who had actually secretly sworn loyalty to the US  http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/nov/30/iaea-wikileaks)  And actual arms inspectors   Iran has mastered many technologies in the uranium-handling and enrichment areas, such that if they wanted to go ahead, they probably could do it. That would make them a threshold state. We can name any number of other states in the world with the same level of technology and expertise. It's the intent that you have to worry about. We don't see intent to this case.   http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=13286  And 5 European ambassadors to Iran say that too http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/09/iran-nuclear-power-un-threat-peace  And actual nuclear experts http://original.antiwar.com/yousaf-butt/2014/06/18/what-is-the-quality-of-scientific-evidence-against-iran/  Oh and the actual international community also says it http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/india-with-nam-in-slamming-iaea-report-on-iran/  Nonaligned states protest Israeli attacks on IAEA http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/22/us-nuclear-iaea-nonaligned-idUSL2187147520071122  The US has been pushing some documents as proof that Iran supposedly engaged in nuclear-related studies (Called the ""Alleged Studies"" by the previous IAEA director, and ""Possible Military Dimensions"" by the new, US-backed IAEA director) until 2003 however the evidence -- to the extent the US has actually let anyone including the IAEA or Iran to see -- has been laughed at/ There have also been a variety of half-baked leaks of ""proof"" of a nuclear weapons program in Iran,  for example the ""AP Graph"" http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-exclusive-graph-suggests-iran-working-bomb  which turned out to be a hoax http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/29/ap-iran-nuclear-program-graph-explanation  as was the general quality of the scientific evidence against Iran http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2012/1205/Flawed-graph-weakens-case-against-Iran-nuclear-program-video  This book is all about that http://www.amazon.com/Manufactured-Crisis-Untold-Story-Nuclear/dp/1935982338"

Chickens require sunlight for vitamin D3 production and can suffer serious ill affects and stress from unnatural light.   I think you're confusing the fact that chickens (barely) survive their confinement in factory farms as evidence that those conditions are perfectly fine for them. It's not, they have absolutely zero quality of life crammed in a barn, in a cage, their entire lives. The stress levels and neurotic behavior displayed should be evidence enough that their natural instincts are being heavily suppressed.  Chickens are natural foragers and nesters, anyone raising free-range chickens with a modicum of empathy for them will realize they go outside all the time, on their own, to satisfy their natural instincts."
TrueReddit,3dih8e,vmlinux,2,Fri Jul 17 18:11:05 2015 UTC,"You don't understand what I'm saying.  Many chicken operations that are free range only give the chickens an option to go outside one they reach a certain maturity.  Almost none of the chickens actually take the option and the chicken lives it's life indoors just like any other operation. For a farm chicken sure they enjoy leaving the coop to go outside, but they had a mother hen that took them outside to eat worms in the yard or whatever.  This has been discussed a lot on reddit, and I'm surprised you missed it since you seem so passionate. There is no such system on a lot of chicken that is labeled free range.  Many producers just use it as a sales gimmick to get a higher price.  Yes it's dispicable.  I seem to be having a difficult making a clear point today or something.

Food, water and (some) light are all put within a few steps, making walking around, or even going outside, unnecessary. Am I correct?

TrueReddit,3dih8e,InfinitelyThirsting,3,Fri Jul 17 03:15:38 2015 UTC,"It certainly can, although some of that demand should be rethought. The American diet is far too dependent on meat, which is both unhealthy and bad for the environment. Which is not to advocate vegetarianism, just a reduction in meat consumption.  With chicken and poultry, though, actual free-range, pastured birds are often out and about in the fields--not when the plants are young, because they'll scratch them up while digging, but later on, birds make very good natural pest control. They can also be kept on the land that's being left fallow with cover crops for soil health, rather than using up extra land.  It'd also be great if we saw greater emphasis on quail, rather than chickens, because quail are actually more productive and more efficient than chickens. The eggs are smaller, but a pound of quail eggs takes less feed and resources than a pound of chicken eggs, and that's before you take space into account (since quail are much smaller).  But in general, yes. In fact, non-industrialized organic farming is more productive in less-fertile areas than industrial farming."

This has nothing to do with farmers or this mysterious poultry industry that's purposefully keeping prices low so that they can make profit on ""chemicals"". Very correctly you said it's the American public that drives the consumerism. We want cheep abundant meat and this is the only method to do so.

Show or hide the answer   No.  Hormone-fed beef is banned in the EU.  That will not change under TTIP.   Tough EU laws designed to protect human life and health, animal health and welfare, or the environment and consumers will not be changed because of TTIP.    Will TTIP force the EU to change its laws on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)? Show or hide the answer   No.    The EU has a strict system for deciding whether to allow companies to sell any given GMO in the EU.  This is entirely separate from trade negotiations.  The EU basic law on GMOs - including the European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) safety assessment and the risk management procedure - is not up for negotiation.  It will not change as a result of TTIP.  Scientists at the EFSA assess all applications to sell GMO products in the EU.  EU governments then consider their findings before deciding whether to approve the application.  So far, they have authorised 58 GMOs.  Regulators in the EU and US already exchange information about GMOs - on policy, regulations and technical issues. TTIP could help them do so more effectively.  This would help limit the effect on trade of our different systems for approving GMOs.     Will TTIP overrule EU laws? Show or hide the answer   No.  TTIP will not overrule, repeal or amend EU legislation.  The EU's 28 member countries and the European Parliament would have to approve any changes to EU laws or regulations in order to liberalise trade.   How will TTIP uphold the EU's strict standards that protect people and the environment?

The approach taken to current rounds of trade agreements is rotten and corrupted by vested interests that see consumers as fodder.  EU to lift ban on importing chicken from the U.S. which has been washed in controversial acid disinfectant   The EU is set to lift a ban on imports of chicken from the United States which are washed with a suspect acid disinfectant.  American producers routinely wash raw chicken following slaughter with a substance called peroxyacetic acid (PAA) to remove harmful bacteria.  The practice has been banned in Britain and Europe for many years because of a determination to remove harmful bugs at source, rather than using disinfectants to clean up carcasses.  There are also concerns that reliance on these washes could put consumers at risk by playing a part in the creation of superbugs.  However, the European Commission has signalled that it plans to lift the ban following pressure from the American government and US chicken producers.   Don't believe the hype: Greed is not Good."

TTIP will too. These guarantees mean EU governments can't be forced to privatise. They remain free to keep public services public – even if they open up other services to foreign competition. Governments can decide, or change, who delivers a public service at any time. This means there's no so called 'ratchet clause' for public services. TTIP won't affect governments' ability to: operate public monopolies or grant exclusive rights to a particular private supplier; decide how to run water distribution services, or publicly-funded education, health or social services; or subsidise these services. These guarantees work. EU trade deals have protected public services for 20 years.   Earlier in January 2015, Commissioner Malmström had already confirmed personally, in writing, the EU's commitment to protecting public services in its current and future free trade agreements, including TTIP. Letter confirming this : http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/july/tradoc_152665.pdf with specific reference to the UK's National Health Service (NHS)  Seriously why not read the EU commission FAQ?    Will TTIP force EU countries to privatise publicly-funded services like healthcare and education?     No.  Neither TTIP nor any other EU trade agreement require countries to liberalise, deregulate or privatise public services at national or local level.  This includes:  public health state education public transport water collection, purification, distribution and management   In its trade agreements, the EU always underlines its commitment to protecting public utilities at all levels of government, including the local level.  Any decision to liberalise, deregulate or privatise such services is entirely up to national governments and local authorities.  Trade agreements will not change that; TTIP will not change that.  Nor will TTIP require EU governments or public health services to put anything out to private contract.  Some EU countries have chosen to allow firms from countries outside the EU to provide private education and health services; others have not.  This is entirely a choice of each national government.  If an EU government decides to renationalise a service that it or a previous government had privatised or contracted out to a private company, it is free to do so.  It would, of course have to respect its own national laws and EU law - for example, by paying compensation for expropriation.  But TTIP will not allow US companies to sue the government for lost profits.

TrueReddit,3dih8e,sanitate_throwaway,2,Thu Jul 16 22:26:00 2015 UTC,"Most chickens are incinerated because they are stacked in cages and there isn't much there to compost them with, but turkey are on the ground with bedding and are generally composted."
TrueReddit,3dih8e,GMNightmare,12,Thu Jul 16 22:32:30 2015 UTC,"Free range chickens are at more of a risk than your typical ""factory farm"" chicken because they're more likely to come in contact with wild birds in some way, which spread it.  So this article is unfounded and is just a display of the authors ignorance. He wants to attack factory farming and will attach anything to do it.  And hey, I'm not a big fan of factory farming myself, which is why I pay 2-3 times as much for those cage-free free-range eggs. But there is no need to lie about the situation. The issue with factory farming is the treatment, not the outcome. We already know the outcome: money. You're not going to change that until you pay up for the difference between the two, and that requires a change in how people think and spend their money. Or government intervention, hey, I'm fine with that route too, but I hear a lot of people don't like that."
TrueReddit,3dih8e,ansiz,3,Thu Jul 16 19:07:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry but I have to completely disagree with that statement.  Considering factory farmed chickens were almost exclusively the ones hit by the disease how could you possibly still try to claim they are at a lower risk than free range chickens?    And by free range I assume you are referring to true outdoor raised chickens and not the ""free range"" you see on egg cartons."
TrueReddit,3dih8e,GMNightmare,6,Thu Jul 16 19:49:14 2015 UTC,"how could you possibly still try   Because I actually know how it spreads? And also know an anecdote does not define it?  If next time, ONLY free range chickens were effected, what would that say? Nothing. Nothing at all. Increased risk doesn't mean it's ONLY going to hit the chickens at greater risk or opposite.  Not that I'm even trusting your claim. ""Almost"" exclusively? What does ""almost"" exclusively mean? It means not exclusive thank you. Did it probably hit more factory farm chickens than others? Sure, simply because we have more factory farm chickens. I guess I should add I think of this as a category event, does it hit your group of farm chickens or your group of free range chickens?   true outdoor raised chickens   Hello, no true chicken fallacy."
TrueReddit,3dih8e,ansiz,0,Thu Jul 16 19:56:54 2015 UTC,"Free range, at least by meaning of an egg carton is basically meaningless.  A lot of the time the definition allows the birds to be housed in extremely high population buildings and not given direct access to the outdoors.  So where is the contact with outside birds coming from?  Both battery cage and cage free are at high risk from the closer quarters the animals are in."
TrueReddit,3dih8e,GMNightmare,10,Thu Jul 16 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"It's meaningless in terms of government regulation. Whether or not you trust the company isn't lying to you is the question. It's the same question you need to ask if you get your free-range eggs from that local farmer. Just because he's local doesn't mean he's trustworthy.   So where is the contact with outside birds coming from?   Can be trucks and any kind of moving, or even people. Wind blowing in contaminated feces particles and so forth. This is your typical viral transmission stuff, same thing happens with humans.  Nothing about the ""closer quarters"" changes anything about initial contamination of a group. And if a chicken on even a ""true"" free range gets sick, more space isn't saving them at all.  Advice to lower the odds your chicken gets avian flu? Limit contact and keep it indoors. Why? Because people know how viruses go around."
TrueReddit,3dih8e,ansiz,-1,Thu Jul 16 21:11:46 2015 UTC,"That still doesn't show why a free range chicken would be more likely to be infected than a battery cage chicken, the same factors you mention as methods of contamination exist in both."
TrueReddit,3dih8e,GMNightmare,6,Thu Jul 16 21:23:05 2015 UTC,"But they are more of a risk for chickens outside.  I don't quite get what you're trying to argue. Are you seriously proposing that viral transmission is more likely if you limit contact to outside influence by being indoors?  I don't get it, really. That a chicken is more likely to interact with wild birds and these methods is why they're more at risk. That's it, that's the reason why. That's just how virus transmission works. Do I need to discuss with you what viruses are?"
TrueReddit,3dih8e,ansiz,-1,Thu Jul 16 21:26:56 2015 UTC,"Factory raised free range chickens don't go outside, the free range is just from allowing them to wander around inside the building they are in.  The minimal outdoor access producers give the birds is frequently a cage about the size of an automobile attached to a building housing 300,000 chickens."
TrueReddit,3dih8e,GMNightmare,6,Thu Jul 16 21:37:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you're trying to argue semantics.  You want to change the definition out from under me? Not very fair, not very honest.

Any reasonable person without an agenda and bias up to their neck would have interpreted my first post with, and all subsequent posts as well. It was obvious.

I was just trying to point out that from a chicken flu perspective both methods are highly vulnerable.  I probably failed to explain my point clearly because I truly wasn't sure what you meant with ""free range""."
TrueReddit,3dih8e,virnovus,2,Thu Jul 16 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"So where is the contact with outside birds coming from?   Wild birds are quite fond of picking through chickens' leftover food, especially when there are open areas like in ""free range"" farming.  Also, ""free range"" and ""factory farmed"" are not mutually exclusive.  ""Factory farming"" just refers to farms that use similar mass-production techniques as factories, and is not very well-defined."

You contribute so much money to a local economy when you shop locally. It's pretty cool to think about. Your ability to influence the economy locally is orders of magnitude greater than your ability to influence Tyson's bottom line.  I pay 5 dollars a dozen for eggs that actually taste like eggs.

Likewise with having meat become more expensive but with more sane production policy. If someone can't afford it, they shouldn't buy it. If they buy it and push themselves into the poverty line, that's just foolishness. The nutrients obtained from meat can be easily replaced by cheaper alternatives so it's not a matter of someone going broke just to avoid malnutrition or a lack of protein in their diet.  You make it seem like raising the price of meat by 50% would render half the US broke, starving, and dying. That's hyperbole and an unfounded assumption.

Not really efficiently though. Without taking bioavailability into consideration, Mat Lalonde has a great talk presenting the results of his analysis of the nutrient density of the various foods in the USDA nutrition database. It's not very surprising when you consider biomagnification, but animal products are significantly more nutrient dense on most counts than non-animal products.

Lack of meat does not cause malnutrition - your comment states that animal tissue is nutrient dense. This doesn't mean lack of it causes malnutrition. The Western diet consists of more animal products than any other, the majority of humans throughout history and in today's world do not consume as much animal products as we do in the West. Meat is comparatively more expensive than many other food products - this is a broad statement but rings true for the most part. You state that you have little doubt meat is more cost efficient in a nutrient to unit of currency basis. Is this consumer price of meat? If factory farming were to be abolished, is this taken into account? Is there any actual research demonstrating this? Does this take into account environmental damage caused through meat production (and especially of intensive meat production)? Increased meat prices is unlikely to cause an economic catastrophe and famine as the person I responded to seemed to indicate - factory farming ought to be abolished. The consequence for doing so are minimal compared to the unethical nature of the practise."

You can find beans, lentils, and chickpeas for way cheaper and make meals with tons of veggies/quinoa or other sides you prefer for a fraction of the cost.

Eating a wholly vegetarian diet can (and often is) more healthy than an omnivorous diet - but this is not the point I was trying to make. The cause of malnutrition is twofold; studies done in the UK repeatedly show that a vegetarian diet is more expensive per-calorie than a diet containing meat-derived foodstuffs; furthermore eating a balanced vegetarian diet also requires a greater amount of dietary planning as well as a greater investment in time for food preparation.  Given that in the last year over a million Britons have already using foodbanks to subsidise their grocery shopping I find these types of comments to be rather obnoxious - we're talking about harming real people who are already struggling to provide food for themselves and their families.  As I said originally, I agree in principle that we should not rely on these unethical farming practices, however other steps would need to be done to alleviate poverty before the suggested course of action could be considered the ethically right course of action."
TrueReddit,3dih8e,Hell_Libertine,2,Fri Jul 17 11:00:35 2015 UTC,"A balanced vegetarian diet does not require a greater amount of planning than an omnivorous diet. Cooking and prepping a vegetarian dish is on average less time-consuming than a meat-based dish. Yes, lack of familiarity is a concern, but it's truly a pretty simple shift to vegetarianism from any other diet (an argument of health and nutrition education vs financial well-being).   Also, the first link in your post is unspecified. Regardless, it depends on what you buy. If you're just buying meat/dairy alternatives, then yes, it will be costly. If you're buying beans, vegetables, and fruits (once again, type matters), then you'll save a lot more money.   Here it shows that in raw form, that a vegetarian diet is significantly cheaper than meat-based products.

This means a hike in prices isn't likely to push people into poverty, it just means they'll eat less meat if they can't afford it.

Whether the bird are in an open pen or in a barn doesn't matter once the virus hits the flock all those birds are going. The virus is pretty wicked and hops around to different barns quickly through carrier birds. Doesn't matter if it's a few chickens in a coop or 150000 in a barn.  Plus the reason they cull so soon is that insurance is based on the live remaining bird population. Either way the virus spreads quite quickly in a barn.

TrueReddit,3diqus,j8sadm632b,152,Fri Jul 17 07:13:17 2015 UTC,"The degree to which substantive arguments have been replaced by arguments over what words we are allowed to use against which people is, as far as I know, completely unique to social justice. Why?   Because social justice is informed by feminist theory, queer theory, and other academic disciplines, which have, like all academic disciplines, idiosyncratic vocabulary in order to make distinctions that general English doesn't.  And because those distinctions are very important if you're trying to grapple with how society really works.  I mean, I know it's annoying when people say 'racism is structural' or 'minorities can't be racist' - but there is a fundamental difference between white prejudice against blacks and black prejudice against whites, because of history, culture, different degrees of power, structural bias in government and media, etc., and it's really, really important to use terms that recognize that, or you're likely to go down the Dylan Harris 'blacks are the worst racists in America' rabbit hole.    And also:  because there's a large group of reactionary/conservative scholars and commentators who are strongly invested in opposing social-justice definitions of terms, because, ideologically, they prefer to focus on people as independent individuals, minimize the influence of society, and dislike positions which assume inherent structural inequality.  A feminist scholar would say that misogyny is real, and misandry is not, because the relative positions of men and women vis-à-vis society are not the same, and the factors that encourage contempt for women's inferiority do not exist in support of contempt for men's inferiority.  The conservative, anti-feminist position begins with the assumption that structural factors are irrelevant, and that the position of men and women vis-à-vis society is equal.  From that viewpoint, ""a man who considers women inferior"" and ""a woman who considers men inferior"" are obviously equal and opposite, and the social factors that support the one position but not the other are irrelevant.  It's annoying, especially with the term 'privilege'.  Unlike 'racist', 'privilege' wasn't a common term before academics started using it to define a particular social phenomenon.  'Having privilege' generally referred to being upper class, as in 'wealth and privilege'.  Nobody seriously talks about 'poverty privilege', you know?  But once feminist academics and sociologists started talking about male privilege, reactionary commentators dragged out the old dictionary definition of 'possessing advantages' and started playing games with words, claiming that there couldn't be any such thing as 'male privilege' because they could think of situations where women possessed advantages too, so everything was completely fair and even and nothing about society needs to change...  Seriously.  If you start out with the assumption that there's no such thing as society, of course you're going to reject the idea that social factors make, eg, anti-white prejudice different from anti-black prejudice.  That's one of the huge reasons there's so much argument over what definitions to use.     There's also so much argument because people don't like having negative terms applied to them, even if the terms are accurate, and so prefer definitions of the word that don't include them.    ""Racist"" is certainly a negative word.  I could call a Klansman a racist.  I could also call my Republican neighbor a racist.  The former use of the word is accurate and correct; the latter is (probably) not.  But both of those people would strenuously object to being called a racist.  And here's the problem:   If I am right, then people’s response to these words should be a frantic game of hot potato where they attack like a cornered animal against anyone who tries to use the words on them, desperately try to throw them at somebody else instead, and dispute the definitions like their lives depend on it.   Sure.  But this will be the case whether or not the claim is accurate.  It will especially happen if the claim is accurate. Why?  Because society thinks it's bad to be racist, and everyone knows that, including the actual racists.  So how do you determine when 'racist' is being used as a stick to bludgeon opponents, and when it's an accurate description?  Hint:  you don't do it by accusing your opponents of a malevolent conspiracy to silence criticism.  One last note:   There is no way to get a quicker reaction from someone in social justice than to apply a social justice term like “privilege” or “racist” to a group that isn’t straight/white/male. And this is surprising.   Privilege can be applied to any number of groups, because privilege exists among more than one axis.  There's racial privilege, gender privilege, wealth and class privilege, and yes, cis privilege.  A wealthy black man is privileged along some axes and unprivileged along others (he can afford health care that a poor white man can't, but he's still likely to be stopped for driving while black), just like everyone else.  What privilege does not do is go in reverse along the same axis.  A woman can be privileged in some ways (wealth, class, race, etc), but that does not mean that 'female privilege' is an accurate depiction, as explained by the many links that Alexander posted (and dismissed as SJWs raving ""with desperation in their eyes"" - as if linking to an 'Explanatory Article' is a bad thing?).  (Also, snarkily:  I love how Alexander pretends that his ideological opponents are 'angry', 'desperate', 'fervid'.  Why doesn't he just say 'hysterical' and go for broke?)"
TrueReddit,3diqus,aescolanus,154,Fri Jul 17 12:18:46 2015 UTC,"Because social justice is informed by feminist theory, queer theory, and other academic disciplines, which have, like all academic disciplines, idiosyncratic vocabulary in order to make distinctions that general English doesn't.

I think one of the primary reasons you see so much hostility toward this is because these academic discipline are unlike other academic disciplines, in that they are not held to the same rigorous standards of empirical evidence, objective scrutiny, or peer reviewed methodology. Much of it seems to be born of a Conclusion-First, Supporting-Data-Second approach, which doesn't bode well for people expecting a firm basis for a discipline claiming to spell out the ills of modern society. What have these disciplines done that should give us confidence in their ability to describe our world accurately? What do they offer that we can't get elsewhere?   Feminist theory and queer theory have no monopoly on discussing the negative aspects of how our social interactions go. The problem arises when social justice advocates interact with everyone else as if everyone else must be obeying and following the fundamental codes and rules of feminist theory, without providing a convincing reason why.   As far as I know there's been no monumental discovery by these disciplines, and these disciplines alone, that enthroned them with the authority to control the way we talk about inequality, or rather, define how we can and can't use words. Therefore, there's no fundamental reason why discussions should play by their rules, use their definitions, or follow their philosophies. When someone criticizes feminist theory or queer theory for using a weird definition of racism or sexism, it's perfectly sensible. These are not the definitions of these words that anyone is familiar with outside of these theories, and so why would they be appropriated and changed to describe things they were not originally meant to, when other, new words would work just as well (probably better, due to lack of misunderstanding)?   Specialized language serves its purpose within the realm of those theories. But when it's used outside of that, to a regular audience, there can be no surprise when it alienates, confuses, or makes people disinterested. Nor should there be surprise if it causes people to take the discipline less seriously, if it's constantly telling us ""These things you think you understand are wrong,"" without giving objective or empirical support."
TrueReddit,3diqus,BukkRogerrs,17,Fri Jul 17 13:04:33 2015 UTC,"I think one of the primary reasons you see so much hostility toward this is because these academic discipline are unlike other academic disciplines, in that they are not held to the same rigorous standards of empirical evidence, objective scrutiny, or peer reviewed methodology.   I'll be honest, I thought the same thing about these fields.  Coming from a heavily scientific background, I thought: how can someone do academic work just based off of ideas and conclusions in their head?  Where's the data?  The evidence?  I have since changed my view.  One quick thing to address - there is actually quite rigorous peer review in modern feminist, queer, critical theory literature and the like.  See journals like Signs, Ethics, etc.  Ethics has a lot of articles from scholars in these types of fields, and that is a very high impact journal that publishes work from a diverse set of domains (political science, economics, etc.).  I'm not an expert in these fields but I'm sure someone could chime in on the best journals.  But for the moment, let's put this concern aside.  Academic fields that are theoretical are inherently different than scientific fields.  There are certainly fields that are in-between that take ideas generated from the pure theory fields and measure them (using rigorous qualitative methods from all the long established social science fields).  Look at anyone doing Sociology, Anthropology, etc.  I'm assuming that you're on board with those fields, even though they aren't hard science per se.  Your objection is more like, why should we care about the theoretical fields (specifically feminist, queer, critical theory and the like) that are not at all empirical? What exactly are their contributions?  What understandings are they providing that has tangibly changed parts of our world today?  My first point would be that theoreticians are there to inform the empiricists who do experiments.  This type of dissemination of ideas happens even in the hard sciences: for example, in physics you have theoreticians and experimentalists.  Sure, physicists develop theories using lots of math, but a lot of what they do relies on creative ideas generated by how they see the physical world, and then someone down the road can perform measurements.  It's the same in feminist theory.  They come up with ideas (intersectionality, etc.) that can actually be measured by social scientists.  For example, you can actually measure, both qualitatively and quantitatively, how people discuss gender in online communities and what kind of impact it might have in say, participation or diversity of thought.  Those kind of experiments were informed by theory, are backed by empirical evidence, and are rigorously reviewed.  My second point is that even with that contribution aside, you can draw a clear line between some very abstract theories and real life changes.  My favorite example (not in the fields you are criticizing, per se, I'll give an example there later) is postmodernism.  I used to think this field was total garbage.  Like, have you ever read Jacques Derrida out loud?  What the fuck is that guy talking about?  But you can draw a direct line from postmodern theory to authors like Thomas Pynchon, David Foster Wallace, Dave Eggers, etc.  People who write really interesting stuff.  That type of literature, heck even a lot of the good TV we watch today, I don't think would have developed without the ideas from postmodernism (unreliable narrators, fractured storytelling, etc.)  In terms of applications of feminist theory, let's take intersectionality as an example.  Know any social workers?  I know a bunch.  One of the things that they are trained for is that when counseling victims of domestic violence, you have to look for easy to miss details when urging them to report.  For example, women living in areas with a history of police brutality may be scared to report for fear of reprisal.  Acknowledging the different systems of oppression at play is the very definition of intersectionality.  Now you might say, heck this is common sense.  Smart people have probably been doing that already.  But there is absolutely value in putting a name on these ideas and developing the theories behind them.  And developing these ideas can and will lead to changes in how people act in the real world."
TrueReddit,3diqus,nxmehta,4,Fri Jul 17 13:15:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the insight. These are good points. Some of this I knew, some I didn't. My own field is physics, and although I try not to compare feminist theory to scientific disciplines, I can't help but question some of the ways they come to conclusions, which are vastly different (understandably so), but to such a degree that I'm left skeptical. Admittedly, most of my experience with feminist and queer theory is through second hand accounts, through the people who advocate it and talk about it, but not via the people doing it. I've read articles that were written by the people involved, and none of them were thorough enough in their treatment to give me a big picture idea of how they go about studying the things they do. What little I have seen of it, though, wasn't impressive from a research standpoint. But perhaps it wasn't enough to inform me on an entire academic discipline.  On the point of postmodernism, my feelings are a mixed bag. While I have appreciation for some literature labeled postmodernist (Borges, Dick, a few others), and unpleasant feelings toward some of it (namely Pynchon, Burroughs), and I value plenty of  films and pieces of music that would be labeled as such, once we leave the realm of the arts I find much of what constitutes postmodernism, or my understanding of it, to seem shallow and silly. I do see value in some of its approaches to understanding art, but with understanding people and society I feel it falls short of providing anything valuable. This may be my own lack of understanding of its ideas, but I've looked into it seriously for some time and never found much to take away from it. I came to my own conclusions on it via many avenues, and have read the input of others who have given it the same fair chance and came away feeling the same way. So it's not that I'm discounting it right off the bat, but I haven't found it to satisfy my intellectual curiosity on the things it typically deconstructs.   As for your last paragraph, I agree entirely. I see these as good, necessary things. If these are the things those theories are working toward, good.   But I question the ways in which feminist theorists or gender researchers come to certain conclusions, and whether or not they are entirely honest or viable ways. For instance, the talk about wage gaps and gender inequality in America is rife with dishonesty, and I've yet to see gender researchers or feminist theorists try to dispel the mythology that is considered common knowledge. This is kind of their field,  and they're responsible for making this misinformation widespread. They don't correct anyone when these ideas are discussed. Instead they seem to back it and say, for instance, that lack of gender parity in STEM fields is due to stereotypes, sexism, and a hostile environment toward women, which are conclusions made before studies are done. These excuses are derived from a worldview that they look to confirm, not a hypothesis that they are interested in falsifying.   When it comes to this topic, these researchers don't seem to acknowledge the inherent differences in male and female brains, or interests, and try instead to chalk it up to societal expectations, environmental factors, just about everything except natural reasons. The insistence with which they chase this idea seems fanatical and far outside the realm of honest research. Gender research has become (or always has been?) less about actually researching fundamental aspects of the sexes or genders, and more about studying the role society and environment play. These are surely interesting, but they're not the full story. And without the full story, the full picture, a field of research lacks some seriously important things."

TrueReddit,3diqus,aescolanus,2,Fri Jul 17 14:28:38 2015 UTC,"The example you gave is a flaw in media, not a flaw in academics. Academics have basically no control over what studies get picked up by the media and almost no control about how these studies are presented. A bunch of news sites deciding to write about some shitty research doesn't mean that an entire field has a problem with academic integrity.   There exists bad social science. But don't think that entire branches of social science are filled with nothing but garbage because a newspaper reported on a shitty study. I mean, I the amount of unbelievably bad reporting about my field (CS) is astonishing but that doesn't mean that there isn't excellent research there too."

No sociologist would draw their conclusions solely from a study on a blog survey, it sounds like you're mad that it's being reported by journalists as significant, not academics, which is a problem in every field."

TrueReddit,3diqus,Phokus1983,29,Thu Jul 16 23:43:11 2015 UTC,"I think that this lays out the con side pretty well, but I still have some objections.  On terms applying to one group but not the other:    Individualist vs. collectivist thinking: Suppose bad thing X happens to groups Y and Z at different rates, 10% and 95%, respectively. It's entirely correct to say that the climate is very against group Z (collectivist), but X sucks when it happens to either group; it sucks when it happens to group Y as well, and any individual of X is probably not too happy about hearing that X is a problem for people of group Z but not Y (individualist objection). A lot of people on either side don't make this distinction, and and we end up in this sort of conversation. Example: ""Most male rape victims have male perpetrators, so men are doing it to themselves.""  Framing: The way issues (especially around gender) are framed is a pretty big objection of mine. Most people who pay any attention to the internet gender debacle have heard that misogyny is the cause of male issues. Example: ""It sucks that men are subjected to harsher sentencing, but that's just a side-effect of women being viewed as weak/patriarchy/misogyny."" I object because, unless you can prove that female gender roles came before male roles, you're just playing semantics at that point. You could just say ""Women being looked at as weak sucks, but it's really just a side-effect of men being punished for showing any weakness, so sexism against women can't exist."" Unless... History: ""X group used to have it worse than Y group."" This isn't quite so clear for sexism. In fact, I don't think it's as accurate as ""different things expected from different genders."" For racism, it's very clear indeed. So let's roll with race. Suppose that in 10,000 years, there exists a society in which whites will be the slaves of black people and have no rights (and keep in mind this is a thought experiment, not an indication of what I think life in the future will look like). Would we still say that racism can only be against people of color? Depending on how many mental gymnastics you want to go through, you might say that black people (in this hypothetical which isn't an accurate description of our society) were so upset that they decided to rise up and punish whites by enslaving them. In this case you could even say that white supremacy came first, and therefore this matter is really just White Privilege Backfiring™. But clearly, whites get to win the oppression olympics in this scenario, so whole thing falls flat. Whites are oppressed here. Things change: So we've got our racism spectrum. I'd argue that things are still pretty bad for blacks (collective). And we have some spots of Bad Things Happening To Whites Because Of Their Race That Isn't Racism. Like getting beat up at school in neighborhoods that are majority people of color. We have subcultures in which it really actually does suck to be white. And we could take the collectivist view and say it isn't racism, or we could take a different collectivist view and say that in these pockets, a ten-thousand-years-in-the-future-esque sort of mood is starting to seep through the door, and it hasn't filled the room yet, but maybe we should give it a bit more credit than we do in view number one. The oppressor-oppressed dichotomy: Why does it have to be that there are the ones who are really oppressed and then the oppressor class? You mention something the the tune of early Marxism, but we have intersectional feminism these days. Our understandings have evolved. We can say that while being black is a disadvantage, being male is an advantage, so that's why black males get longer prison times than black women. Wait a minute. That makes no sense. The problem is that while there are multiple axis of privilege, each one is unidirectional. Which completely fails to explain things like the above example. So this post has gone on much longer than I intended. But my conclusion is that we really want to model things accurately. With our current framework, in the 10,000 years in the future example, what would it do? Would they one day proclaim, ""Okay, at midnight racism can't happen to blacks but can happen to whites.""? That seems like a pretty poor way of doing things. I think our understanding of privilege needs to evolve past intersectionality. As things become different, groups diverge, and time goes on, it will be harder and harder to keep things straight with the collectivist attitude of prior groups being ""the oppressed ones."" We should abandon that view, and allow racism to be against whites, and sexism to be against men (the historical context wasn't as clear here, anyways). We need to let the tools evolve to fit the world as the world changes, rather than trying to hammer in a screw. ""Racism is only against blacks"" doesn't fit as well anymore, and we need to look to the future when trying to make stuff fit.   P.S. He was talking about equivocating different kinds of racism. I don't think your post got it. I was going to write about that, but fuck it, I've been sitting here too long."

This is why a lot of 'SJWs' get frustrated when people come into a discussion about the 90% and start asking 'what about the 10%'?  Black prejudice against white people is not the same phenomenon as white prejudice against black people, and people who come in and try to draw equivalencies are both changing the topic (because the two prejudices are different) and being dismissive/trying to minimize the problem (because acting like X is the mirror image of Y ignores the structural factors that make X so widespread).   Example: ""Most male rape victims have male perpetrators, so men are doing it to themselves.""   Good example.  All rape is heinous.  Full stop.  But the structural factors that help cause, justify, and encourage male-on-male rape (most notably our horribly broken prison system) are different from the structural factors that do the same to male-on-female rape and still more different from the structural factors that do the same to female-on-male rape.  We can't have a discussion about 'rape' in general and pretend those different factors don't exist.  It's not honest, and it's not useful, which is why 'what about male rape victims' is derailing in a discussion about female rape victims.  (Again:  no one should be raped or sexually assaulted, ever, and (almost all) feminists are happy to recognize the structural factors which make society hold male victims in contempt.  But those factors are different - that aspect of rape culture is different than the aspect of rape culture which targets female victims - and the discussions generally need to be separate ones.)

I object because, unless you can prove that female gender roles came before male roles, you're just playing semantics at that point.   How so?  Looking at history, your example is demonstrably accurate.  Western law draws on a long tradition of women not being allowed to be moral actors in their own right (for which I blame the patriarchy), possessions of men (ditto), not capable of higher moral reasoning and closer to children than adults (ditto), not being capable of violence/not legitimate threats (ditto, and this is why domestic violence and sexual assault by women on men is taken less seriously, because Western society has always defined 'violence' as 'strength', as the flip side of a positive quality, and denied that positive quality to women)...   Suppose that in 10,000 years, there exists a society in which whites will be the slaves of black people and have no rights (and keep in mind this is a thought experiment, not an indication of what I think life in the future will look like).    Okay, this gets me a little frustrated.  American society is not a thought experiment.  It's not difficult to point to hundreds of ways that black people are disadvantaged and fucked over by a society which sees white as default and black as 'other'.  Here.  Now.  Pure reason is all very well, and ten thousand years in the future who knows what will happen - but there are people alive today who were beaten and imprisoned for trying to vote or go to school.  There are entire communities sunk in crime-ridden poverty because the explicitly racist government and society of prior generations kept their fathers and grandfathers from getting the kind of advantages that suburban whites are born with.  When I talk about historical factors, I'm not talking about some nebulous historical once-upon-a-time, I'm talking about provable, demonstrable ways in which black communities are still being fucked over by past racism.

That's the problem with a lot of anti-social-justice arguing - they cherry-pick specific factors where privileged group X seems to have it worse than underprivileged group Y and use those out-of-context examples to critique the entire concept of privilege.  To go back to my comments above:  strength is generally a positive, and the capacity for violence is one way that society defines strength.  Men are expected to be strong (in many different ways) in order to both promote and justify their benefits in society.  Unfortunately, the idea that men are strong and women aren't (male privilege) runs headlong into the idea that black people are more dangerous to society than white people (white privilege), resulting in harsher prison sentences for black men than for black women.  Compare the prisoners' dilemma in game theory - the interactions of competing incentives cause an apparently paradoxical result.   As things become different, groups diverge, and time goes on, it will be harder and harder to keep things straight with the collectivist attitude of prior groups being ""the oppressed ones.""   That would be nice!  But we have to deal with the world as it is, not the world as it could be.  In America, right now, right here, white prejudice against blacks is defended and encouraged by entrenched structural factors, and black prejudice against whites is defended and encouraged by a backlash against those same structural factors.  (Fuck, man, if I grew up in a shitty ghetto where every person I saw with my skin color was dirt poor and every person I talked to had legitimate stories of being fucked over by people with a certain other skin color, I'd hate white people too.)

It's the individualist perspective talking. Sadly, on such issues (90/10) what ends up happening is 99% of help goes to one side and the other is left in the dark.  To your next point: this also applies. Even rape victim advocates end up downplaying male rape. This isn't exactly male rape, but here's an example of what I mean. In this case, it does make sense to ask about male rape victims, though I certainly understand the frustration from being unable to talk about female rape specifically without someone chiming in.  Edit: Accidentally hit reply too soon, more incoming in a minute.  Edit 2: To continue to your next point...   How so? Looking at history, your example is demonstrably accurate.

And this is where I really have to disagree. Men have always had roles alongside those of women. I actually explained my thinking here in the very next sentence after the one you quoted, so you might want to respond to that before we go any farther.

The present situation is more important than the past. You say that black communities are still being fucked over by past racism, and I agree; we can then say that racism is still negatively affecting blacks and go on how bad it is for blacks now rather than relying on the past (and yes, the past helps explain why things are bad, that's not my argument). I'm disappointed that you didn't respond to my thought experiment. You say that American society is not a thought experiment, but I don't think that is a very good argument against using one. That famous though experiment isn't literally what abortion is, but it's still extremely influential, and for good reason.

Imprisonment is arguably the biggest problem facing the black community today. I can take these examples, because as time goes on, there are going to be more and more of them. You're looking at the issues in black and white (no pun intended). You describe the world with the theory, you don't take a theory and try to mash the world into it. It's no paradox at all, you just have to acknowledge that it isn't as straight-forwards as an oppressor-oppressed dichotomy.

TrueReddit,3diqus,matt_512,6,Fri Jul 17 06:32:14 2015 UTC,"and (almost all) feminists are happy to recognize the structural factors which make society hold male victims in contempt   Your experience with feminists may be different from that of other people, and of course, we have the problem of definitions (very well described by the article), where several different groups of people with widely varying beliefs all call themselves feminists.  However, one very common way in which modern feminist theory ""recognizes"" these structural factors is by blaming patriarchy - which is essentially the same response as to many other inquiries.  But ""patriarchy"" is frequently presumed to be a tool that is both created by, and benefits, males - usually abbreviated to all males, or at least all white straight cis males, and as such, they automatically lose any ability to complain, even if the specific male that gets shafted by one of those factors had nothing to do with establishing it. ""You got a super long prison sentence for a fairly mundane crime, and are now getting raped without any recourse? Well, too bad that your fellow men made this system; you should work with them to dismantle it, which will benefit you in the process."" Or, ""You got expelled after a false rape accusation? Well, you should have taught your fellow men not to rape!""  In other words, (pretty much all) men are responsible for all of the societal evils created by any men, as if all men, as a group, make collective decisions.   This is obviously false. It's also very obvious that these evils were, and are still, being made by a small group of very powerful people - yes, mostly white straight cis men - that make them for their own benefit, and benefit of others like them, and that takes no input from other members of their supposed privilege category. The abhorrent state of the American criminal system, for instance, was not made by men for the privilege of men and at the expense of women, nor by whites for the privilege of whites at the expense of blacks - but by the ruling class for the its own privilege and at the expense of everyone else.   The only real privilege groups - if we're talking about modern Western societies, not 1950s and not Saudi Arabia - are those constructed by class and wealth, and pretty much nothing else. To the extent men still have privilege over women, whites over blacks, and straight over gay (and it's questionable whether those, particularly the first, still exist), those pale in comparison with the real privilege - of the wealthy and upper-class over everyone else. And it's this conversation that should inform the societal discourse."

If we're talking about patriarchy, this is completely incorrect.  Patriarchy isn't an Illuminati-style conspiracy theory; it's a descriptor for a set of social norms which, inter alia and in general, privilege men and male things over women and female things.  These social norms operate through everyone and at every level of society.  Do you really think a handful of rich white men convinced the world that women shouldn't be educated or allowed to compete for the best jobs?  Or that those same rich white men fooled women in dozens of conservative cultures throughout the world into reinforcing rape culture (by teaching their daughters that women are responsible for men's desire to rape and only 'bad girls' allow/provoke men to rape them)?  The American criminal system - which, I agree, is utterly abhorrent - wasn't built by a handful of rich people sitting around and deciding to shit on blacks; it was built democratically, one piece at a time, each step accompanied by thunderous applause.  Patriarchy was not created, and is not enforced, from the top down, and won't magically disappear after the plutocrats are put up against the wall.  It developed from the roots of society, and can only be altered by a transformation from the roots up.   Or, ""You got expelled after a false rape accusation? Well, you should have taught your fellow men not to rape!""   That's a strawman and/or troll.  I have heard a similar argument - or, at least, an argument using similar words - and it goes like this:  ""We're sorry that you were expelled because of a false accusation, and we hope that the injustice done to you is rectified.  At the same time, a university is not a courtroom.  With rates of sexual assault on campus being as high as they are, and the rates of false accusation being as low as they are, we respect the university's choice to err on the side of protecting assault victims.   In other words, (pretty much all) men are responsible for all of the societal evils created by any men, as if all men, as a group, make collective decisions.   So I posted a link a little while ago that deals with exactly this misconception.  Alexander's essay talks about it too.  Activists say ""you, as a man, are benefiting from male privilege"".  Men hear 'you, as a man, are guilty"".  Then they reject the entire concept because they don't want to feel guilty.  Let me be blunt:  despite what anti-feminist activists and regressive commentators like to claim, the existence of patriarchy does not mean that all men are responsible for evils done by men and to women.  Feminists do not claim this.  It is a strawman used to discredit the entire concept of patriarchy by making it sound like a personal attack on all individual men.   To the extent men still have privilege over women, whites over blacks, and straight over gay (and it's questionable whether those, particularly the first, still exist), those pale in comparison with the real privilege - of the wealthy and upper-class over everyone else. And it's this conversation that should inform the societal discourse.   They still exist.  Things are getting better, but they still exist, as you would know if you listened to, e.g. women, non-whites, and gay people.  It sounds, honestly, that male privilege, white privilege, and straight privilege don't affect you personally, and so you're dismissing those concerns to focus on something that does affect you - wealth and class.  Which is why feminism needed intersectionality in the first place - because it was focused on the concerns of upper-class white women and acting as if those concerns were representative of all women.  Feminism has grown since then.  Marxism needs to catch up."
TrueReddit,3diqus,aescolanus,4,Fri Jul 17 15:01:04 2015 UTC,"Patriarchy isn't an Illuminati-style conspiracy theory   I never claimed that. I do, however, claim that the societal evils commonly blamed on rather abstract patriarchy (as if developed by many, or most, men to favor themselves over women) can in many cases be explained by specific policies made by a handful of specific people to benefit themselves over everything else.  Consider, for example, the American criminal system, which seems to be one of the few points we agree on. Rather than resigning its horrors to white people deciding to fuck over black people, one can instead analyze the history of its creation, and see quite clearly that some of the primary objectives, which are still being served, of that system is to provide constant stream of profit and to control the lower class - not women, not blacks, but the lower class and the poor.   Do you really think a handful of rich white men convinced the world that women shouldn't be educated or allowed to compete for the best jobs? Or that those same rich white men fooled women in dozens of conservative cultures throughout the world into reinforcing rape culture (by teaching their daughters that women are responsible for men's desire to rape and only 'bad girls' allow/provoke men to rape them)?   Are we still talking about modern America? If we're instead talking about 1950s, or the Middle East (mostly excepting Israel), then we don't need to continue this conversation, as I'm in agreement with you there. There's definitely a structural, established, and prevalent system that benefits men over women, and this system should be dismantled.  But in the 2015 America, it, with minor exceptions, has been dismantled. There's no rape culture in any reasonable sense of the word. There's no glass ceiling - almost all of the difference in salary between sexes is due to the personal choice (and yes, it is a problem that many women choose to not go into careers with potentially higher salaries, but to blame that on patriarchy is quite misleading, as this comic shows pretty bluntly).  Speaking from a personal experience, as someone living in a major (and very liberal) city, none of my friends are misogynists, sexists, or homophobes. No one needs to taught not to rape; everyone understands that women's dress choices do not in any way count as permission to engage in sexual intercourse; no one thinks that blacks just need to work harder, that gay people are abnormal and need to be fixed, that women need to be subservient to men, or any other such nonsense. None of the major (or even minor) publications even hint about that, and no part of that is anywhere within the Overton window. There's simply not much to fix anymore.   That's a strawman and/or troll. I have heard a similar argument - or, at least, an argument using similar words - and it goes like this: ""We're sorry that you were expelled because of a false accusation, and we hope that the injustice done to you is rectified. At the same time, a university is not a courtroom. With rates of sexual assault on campus being as high as they are, and the rates of false accusation being as low as they are, we respect the university's choice to err on the side of protecting assault victims.   This is problematic, to borrow a term from people we're discussing, on many levels. To wit:   and we hope that the injustice done to you is rectified   That's rarely part of the statement. Almost always, the falsely accused guy (and especially a falsely accused guy that was able to proof his innocence) is vilified, either because ""he obviously did it but got away on a technicality"", or the even more amazing ""maybe he didn't rape her, but he must have done something bad to her to deserve this"" argument. Very rarely is the assumption that the guy may have been innocence is even raised. Consider the mattress girl - she became a national celebrity while the guy was bullied on campus, even after the university, which we seem to both agree was trying to at least be very attentive to signs of possible rapes, failed to find any. Or consider the recent Amherst case, where the university didn't even allow the guy to present evidence of his innocence.   With rates of sexual assault on campus being as high as they are,    The rates of sexual assault on campus are lower than outside of campus. From the source - which is a US DoJ report, not an MRA site -    The rate of rape and sexual assault was 1.2 times higher for nonstudents (7.6 per 1,000) than for students (6.1 per 1,000).   So it's actually safer to be on campus than outside, and both rates are pretty low - at less than 1% chance, way below the commonly cited 20% figure, obtained from a very non-scientific poll by a biased author, as you're likely aware.   the rates of false accusation being as low as they are   According to who? The commonly cited 2% statistics is almost baseless; the actual numbers are very hard to find, because they depend, in part, on a bunch of definitions that differ between the authorities - and specifically depend on how much of belief that an accusation is actually false do you need to label it as such (i.e., should an accusation that's 80% likely to be false count as one, or as an unknown case? what about a 60%?) This list gives estimates as low as 1.5% and as high as 90%, with quite a few data points around 25%, not a low number by any reason, given what the consequences of such an accusation are. Onto that -    we respect the university's choice to err on the side of protecting assault victims.   Even if all of the above was not true, this should never happen in a modern society. The very idea of crime and punishment that's basic to Western civilization is that punishing innocent people is a much worse perversion of justice than failing to punish guilty ones. I'm aware that a university is not a court of law - but when the penalties it accesses are as severe as they are - an expulsion for sexual misconduct, while less capable of ruining one's life as a rape conviction and subsequent incarceration, is still extremely damaging to one's job and social prospects, and in that light, the university's ""choice"" to ""err on the side of protecting victims"" (that are, obviously, not victims in cases of actual false accusations) becomes indefensible.    Let me be blunt: despite what anti-feminist activists and regressive commentators like to claim, the existence of patriarchy does not mean that all men are responsible for evils done by men and to women. Feminists do not claim this. It is a strawman used to discredit the entire concept of patriarchy by making it sound like a personal attack on all individual men.   Again, there are very different groups that all call themselves ""feminists"", and your choice of the subset of that movement, specifically the more reasonable part, may not be very reflective of reality. Nevertheless, even the more reasonable factions usually make this argument in a slightly different way: ""all men are not responsible for patriarchy, but all men do benefit from it, and thus it is all men's responsibility to fight the patriarchy, or else, by your inaction, you become partially responsible for its evils. So, go ahead and teach your fellow men not to rape.""   They still exist. Things are getting better, but they still exist, as you would know if you listened to, e.g. women, non-whites, and gay people. It sounds, honestly, that male privilege, white privilege, and straight privilege don't affect you personally,    It's interesting that you automatically come to thinly veiled conclusions about my status as a member of those groups purely by my stance on these issues, as if no reasonable woman, black, or gay person may object to at least the more controversial tenets of third-wave feminism, such as patriarchy and rape culture. (Or, if they do, they get accused of having ""internalized"" misogyny, racism, or homophobia, respectively)."

I have read so many testimonials by black people, speaking about their experiences with racism - especially this year, with the Charleston shooter and the many high-profile killings of unarmed black men by cops - that I don't understand how anyone who's paying attention to the conversation could deny that racism is still a tremendous problem and white privilege is still a thing.  Similarly, when women, gay people, and trans people speak and write about their experiences, I believe what they write, and recognize the challenges they face to help me understand the level of my privilege as a straight man.    And patriarchy and rape culture are quite unexceptional tenets of second-wave feminism, and, again, demonstrably accurate descriptions of modern American culture (though, again, they are less harmful than they used to be).  The problem comes when people use false definitions of patriarchy (""all men are evil"") or rape culture (""all men want to rape"") in order to discredit feminism in general."

I really like Scott Alexander's writing, but I think he has trouble completely understanding some issues you hit on.  I don't feel you touched on his core point.  (edit: or I don't understand how what you said applies to it.)   Let's define racism by the technical institutional definition of the word.  (I see it as the equivalent of using ""hacker"" in the tech sense instead of the ""illegal"" sense.  Most people will get the wrong impression, and it's obtuse to pretend they understand you.)   The modern definition of ""institutional racism"" - the SJ/structural one - definitely applies to our Republican neighbors.  It is definitely not unusual to call the Republican platform or those who support it racist - shit, that's an obvious case compared to some of the crap I've seen on this site.  I've seen just supporting the principle of free speech in general decried as racist because of the structural effects of unrestricted speech on Reddit.  It applies to every white person, to varying degrees.  Calling someone a racist is not exactly meaningful.    But when you call someone a racist, in general conversation, you don't mean that, as part of their status as a white person, they scored weird on an implicit association test.  You mean the Strom Thurmond sense - ""that person is a prejudiced asshole.""   I feel like some people are being extremely disingenuous in their use of language, often unintentionally, because they really don't have a clear picture of what the word means - between the technical SJ definition and the one everyone uses 90% of the time."

I think there's definitely a difference between racist as adjective and racist as noun - ""this belief is racist"" is different from ""you are a racist"", and the individual definition obviously predominates when talking about individual human beings.  Which is one of the problems Alexander identifies, albeit in not so many words.  'You hold racist beliefs' is not a personal attack.  'You are a racist' is.  Lots of people on the receiving end of the former reinterpret it as the latter - because some people don't want to be considered racist, some people are openly biased against other races but don't want to admit it, and everyone dislikes having bad terms applied to them.  Again, though, the solution has to be an open discussion about - and an unbiased attempt to understand - what the words mean and how they are used.  Alexander's interpretation, that whenever SJWs bring up racism they're calling people racist to shut down discussion, is simply wrong - but lots and lots of people, who don't want to think about structural racism and how they benefit from it, are happy to believe that SJWs are using content-free words to silence dissent."
TrueReddit,3diqus,aescolanus,45,Fri Jul 17 04:58:25 2015 UTC,"To me the issue isn't that things like white privilege don't exist. It's not that racism on the part of white people is far more damaging than racism on the part of black people.   It's that the people wielding these weapons have very little interest in these concepts. White privilege is not used as a tool to educate people, it's used as a bludgeon to silence critics.   Take the concept of privilege. It is a wonderful and powerful tool that has open my eyes to the many ways my life is easier than a person of colours life. But this tool was abused by people who instead saw it as a way to get people to shut up and always be right. The same with the concept of racism = power+predjudice. People have run that concept into the ground by misrepresenting it. Too many people took it to mean ""If I'm not white and male I can say as many shitty things as I want, and it's not bad.""   That's two tools that could have been used to educate people instead used for personal gain, to the point that no one can now use them. And worse, their overuse often causes a violent reaction in people the other way. People that could have been talked to in the past about privilege and racism are now unwilling to talk about it.   So yes, many of the concepts in the Social Justice movement are correct. But then, many concepts the Bolsheviks professed were correct too. The Proletariat was being oppressed by a brutal ruling class that profited from their work. Overthrowing the Tzar was probably a pretty good idea. But how did that turn out? Did the Bolsheviks professing to believe this concept, promising that things would be different ACTUALLY believe it? Did things actually turn out different? Or was one oppressor simply swapped for another?  And that's the danger of many SJWs. Yes, yes, you'll call me dramatic. Maybe accuse me of a variation of godwin's law. But I would counter - those that do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. And history has shown us that powerful ideas can easily be co-opted by bad people.   IMO, social justice is a force of inevitable change. And in our love and support for this change, we are letting FAR too many people get away with being shitbags. The more we allow radicals to control the movement, the more we allow them to represent the movement, the worse the outcome will be."

In the vernacular, it means something that is bestowed upon you that's better than the norm. My not being pulled over by the cops for shits and grins because I'm white isn't privilege, it's just the way everyone should be treated.   Most of what's called ""privilege"" is just a subset of people being treated in the way that everyone should be treated. It's correct to say that other people face discrimination or oppression in this or that way, and that they should be treated better, but calling getting fair treatment ""privilege"" carries the implication that the privileged should also be treated worse. It lowers the bar and sets everyone up to lose out in the long run.

It's not a malevolent conspiracy, just the output of the weird incentive structure that's been built around liberal memes. linguistic defectors get to call innocent people racist. This gives them power with little cost, so in practice we see the terms used as weapons. None of these incentives require coordination.   The difficulty of coordination is what makes ""conspiracy"" a bad explanation in most cases. I presume you're a believer in the patriarchy, which you have to admit has an uncanny resemblance to many conspiracy narratives. For example, the alleged pay gap, if the result of sexism, would require economically counterproductive coordination among employers, as any defectors would be able to exploit the market inefficiency for cheap labour, which would drive wages to male equivalence very quickly.   So I wouldn't be throwing stones.    (Also, snarkily: I love how Alexander pretends that his ideological opponents are 'angry', 'desperate', 'fervid'. Why doesn't he just say 'hysterical' and go for broke?)   Scott takes extraordinary pains to treat his opponents fairly.

Instead its a combination of a zillion factors including implicit bias and cultural expectations that lead women to get paid less than men as a population. But even though it isn't overt sexism that doesn't mean that it isn't real or that it isn't a problem.   This is one more example of what the excellent post at the top of the thread was talking about.

I am black therefore I cannot be racist. I am a woman therefore I cannot be sexist. I am young/old therefore I cannot be ageist. Say what?  It's an idea pulled from thin air which is what makes it such garbage. The article says it best when it says people should have come up with another word for discussing structural oppression instead of trying to bastardize a word that means something wildly different.  Also, the examples you use don't mimic the same mutation that academics are trying to put racism through. For example, when you talk about organic, the underlying theme in all of your definitions is something that's natural/naturally occurring. The point is, that argument you're making is extremely superficial and doesn't dig deep enough into why the rebranding of racism is illogical. It's not just about whether or not a word can mean more than one thing - pointing that out is pretty trivial to the overall argument.

To use your organic example, what if it was fertilizer companies trying to tell gardeners that using refined nitrogen fertilizer is ""organic""? If suddenly and without explanation a fertilizer company sought to use the word ""organic"" to describe generic nitrogen fertilizer in ad copy, gardeners would rightfully demonize them for deliberately misleading consumers.

TrueReddit,3diqus,nbseivjbu,-5,Fri Jul 17 04:49:16 2015 UTC,"Again, the problem is individual versus collective and issues of definition.  The social and cultural aspects that tend to privilege men over women (which we define as 'male privilege'), in certain contexts, do lend women advantages.  For example, women are seen as weaker (in many different ways - physically, emotionally, mentally, logically) than men.  But 'strength' is closely linked to 'violence', so the same construct which considers women weak and inferior also assumes that men are more dangerous, so women aren't taken as seriously as aggressors.  Thus, women as a class can receive, in certain situations, advantages from a construct which in general disadvantages women.  This has been dubbed ""benevolent sexism"".  The issue isn't that privilege goes two ways.  The issue is that society is really, really complicated, and privilege interacts with lots of other things.  (The reason this is important, btw, is because solving the problem requires understanding the problem.  It's not enough to complain that the justice system is biased in favor of women in some situations - you have to understand why that bias exists in order to take positive steps to eliminate it.)"

I have heard this argument put forth before, mostly in regards to patriarchy theory, but I've always found it wanting. I don't think it does a very good job of explaining how the world works and leads me to see it more as a narrative that can be changed by ideology rather than evidence. When something that would be normally be considered an aspect of privilege but applies to a generally disadvantaged group it gets dismissed so as to keep 'privilege' as kind of a sacred concept.  I think every class of people can have privilege based on context and that no theory has been able to adequately explain all of them in all of the complexities we see. Coming from a different social science I think finding solutions usually only needs to define the problem and then come up with viable solutions. Things like anti-discrimination laws are a good example where you don't even have to understand why the bias exists necessarily, just that it exists, to start fixing things especially because why is not always agreed upon. My experience is Privilege Theory has some validity but isn't useful in actually changing anything or even recognizing all of the problems and is limited in even finding out the why."

For starters, a lot of people do not consider ""queer theory"" or ""feminist theory"" to be in any way legitimate academic disciplines. They are no more valid academically than if I created an entire academic department ""banhammerred theory"" where everyone who participates debates about what they think I think and how they can best conform to my opinion. I could even make up my own terminology to go along with my made up discipline but that wouldn't make it any more legitimate. You've probably already stopped reading, but just in case you haven't let me say why I feel this way. Almost all those ""academic disciplines"" theories are unfalsifiable. They are in no way confirmed except by the shared self interest off all the various individuals who identify themselves with each respective academic theory set (queer, femiminist etc). So feminists benefit from feminist theory, and they all benefit from it being legitimized by academia (even though it doesn't belong there).    Feminist theories are taken seriously because feminist academics come up with them and feminists enact and push them forward and feminists (read: women) benefit from them and so on. This is a bit like McDonalds Hamburger University being take seriously in academic circles and publishing glowingly positive papers on the health effects of eating Big Macs. Next thing you know the food pyramid has a lot of Big Mac content in it. Your doctor starts asking you: ""Are you getting enough special sauce in your diet?""     It's annoying, especially with the term 'privilege'. Unlike 'racist', 'privilege' wasn't a common term before academics started using it to define a particular social phenomenon. 'Having privilege' generally referred to being upper class, as in 'wealth and privilege'.     That's still true. A lot (or almost all) feminists are bougie white women who have the luxury and resources to pursue a degree in Gender Studies or somesuch, despite the fact that such a degree doesn't provide or indicate having any marketable or useful skills. It does however say a lot about the holders politics however, so they probably enjoy some ""liberal privilige"" when they get a job from fellow socially liberal / socialist hiring managers.     ""Racist"" is certainly a negative word. I could call a Klansman a racist. I could also call my Republican neighbor a racist. The former use of the word is accurate and correct; the latter is (probably) not     That last part is the key. Our Republican friend can't prove he's not racist. You can throw that word at him and there is literally nothing he can do to defend himself. In Kafka-esque fashion the more he tries to defend himself the more guilty he seems! Yay!     So how do you determine when 'racist' is being used as a stick to bludgeon opponents, and when it's an accurate description? Hint: you don't do it by accusing your opponents of a malevolent conspiracy to silence criticism.     You answered your own question: you can't! That's why it's so effective as a social weapon. There is no effective defence (except being a PoC or gay or some other untouchable group). You can label somebody who has something you want, or something you both are competing for, in other words, whenever there is a zero sum outcome, the liberal plays the race card on his white male hetero opponent. Bam! The guy is nuked. If he defends himself, it only gets worse! Checkmate. The entire liberal social justice lexicon is full of unfalsifiable concepts that are all excomminicable offences, in that they will get you excommunicated from your job, society, friends whatever."

But wouldn't that be true for almost any kind of academic study which is not related to hard science?

That's not a valid argument.. We have decades of great research on communities on any axis, great useful debates in academia about how things are and why they might be. These fields are being dismissed for what seems like no reason to me.   We don't have to speculate about power, trends, statistics, societal mechanisms - there are rigorous studies out there that use the scientific method and that are held to standards of validity and rigor already. Is everyone just saying the fields are worthless because of bogeymen giving them bad names, or are the fields being dismissed because society is too soft to study like a science? Because it's not.."
TrueReddit,3diqus,helloily,41,Fri Jul 17 07:03:55 2015 UTC,"It's the overreach. When people bandy about theory as if it perfectly describes the truth and structure of society, there better be some damn good evidence to back it up. Often in social sciences there's not. Qualitative descriptions of statistical patterns in a system don't tell us anything about their origins, mechanisms, or purposes (if they have any).   Often, social systems are impervious to meaningful statistical analysis due to their messiness and complexity, and moreover researchers can't conduct what could potentially be enlightening controlled experiments due to ethical concerns. Still many of these disciplines lack a defining feature of the natural sciences: their theories lack falsifiable predictions. How can we know your ideas are true, actual elements of reality, if we can't put them to the test? In that regard, they have the same flaws as Marxism.  Much of what i said applies in particular to sociology and more so to gender studies and feminist theory. This is not meant to mean that these disciplines and other social sciences are not worth engaging in and studying, but when you accord them the same weight in their pursuit of truth as the natural sciences, you get ideologues that use the nebulous theories and ideas from those disciplines and impress those ideas upon others with something akin to a religious zeal. Why might this be a bad thing? Working under the assumption of being able to manipulate a system that you think you understand but likely don't often leads to negative unforeseen consequences. For instance, as most of these disciplines deal with groups of people, societies, social engineering has often ended up with less than ethical results usually limiting personal freedoms and creating outgroups unjustly.  However, we should still explore the ideas associated with the social sciences and social phenomena albeit with a little more humility regarding their validity/truth. When the basic particle of the systems you study is a human being, much of your theories won't conform to reality as you tackle with the tangled complexity of social systems. We see it all the time with economics, the most quantitative of the social sciences, and psychology, arguably the most scientific of them. Their relative importance in their pursuit of truth should be relegated to that of philosophy and literature1 , where one must grapple intellectually with the ideas being presented. Working through them on your own, whether you believe them or not, you're better off for having been exposed to them.  1 - an edit here; I'd like to say that there is a spectrum here regarding the ""truthiness"" or maybe ""verifiability"" of a discipline. I don't think we should throw all of the social sciences under the same umbrella as psychology and economics seem more sound than subdisciplines of sociology; I'd say the more speculative the field, the less ""truthiness"" one should grant it."

TrueReddit,3diqus,UncleMeat,0,Fri Jul 17 16:55:39 2015 UTC,"Almost all those ""academic disciplines"" theories are unfalsifiable. They are in no way confirmed except by the shared self interest off all the various individuals who identify themselves with each respective academic theory set (queer, femiminist etc). So feminists benefit from feminist theory, and they all benefit from it being legitimized by academia (even though it doesn't belong there).   I'm confused by what you consider an academic discipline and what you consider academia. Just because something is ""unfalsifiable"" does not necessary mean it's incapable of generating knowledge or insight, and just because a subject isn't quantitative research doesn't mean it's not academic. Do the Humanities simply not exist to you, or do you consider half the tertiary education system in the past thousand years (longer in China and the Middle East) to be valueless?  I'm willing to bet that you've never read any actual feminist or queer theory scholarship, or spoken to anyone remotely qualified in those fields. The idea that those fields exist simply to stick labels of sexism or homophobia onto people is like saying the entire discipline of Chemistry exists to help Pantene customers achieve sleeker hair with more volume."

If you take any proposed counterexample to your theory and are able to handwave it away by theorizing an explanation as to how said counterexample is actually the result of your theory, you're not being scientific. It's impossible to know if your theory reflects reality if it doesn't make testable predictions.  Now being unfalsifiable doesn't mean an idea/theory lacks philosophical value. It can absolutely lead to insight by broadening our intellectual perspective. That alone is academically important, but if we ascribe the authority of truth to an unfalsifiable theory that we do to something like general relativity, we're being epistemologically rash, and possibly blinding ourselves to alternative points of view that legitimately challenge/critique the theory."

I would also guess that feminists donate a lot of money to Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights organizations, which are focused on providing services to poor people (the rich hardly need to go to public clinics) - and reproductive choice and family planning are two very strong factors in helping people break the cycle of poverty...  I would also also guess that people who are feminists are not, in general, one-trick ponies.

From that viewpoint, ""a man who considers women inferior"" and ""a woman who considers men inferior"" are obviously equal and opposite, and the social factors that support the one position but not the other are irrelevant.

TrueReddit,3diqus,sarcbastard,20,Fri Jul 17 08:20:42 2015 UTC,"I've always been kind of apprehensive of ""Privilege"" as a method for breaking down and interpreting social inequality. I think it's correct, but it frames dialogue in a way that makes things personal, and encourages some to invalidate the experiences of others. I've seen so much dialogue turn into a slap fight between two people arguing that their interpretation of social injustice is more accurate for the subset of injustice they face. Privilege, in that context, turns into a blame game, where people reach for tenuous branches of their identity to support their ideas, or feel validated.  Anecdotally, I'm trans, I'm predominantly white but a little Caribbean, more-or-less middle class, more-or-less gay. I am in a position where I have a lot of privilege, and a lot of dis-privilege. In the trans community, there are often arms races where people argue that their increasingly specific subset of the community is more important, more maligned, more vital, more attacked, etc than the rest of the trans community, and as a result deserves a more central role in dialogue. This not only paints inaccurate pictures of all of our struggles, but also encourages people to further radicalize and create factions, and drives a considerable amount of flight from the community. These sort of arguments, generally centered on discussion of privilege, drive the community apart (Seriously, you want to see the trans community tear itself apart, say someone has or has had male privilege. Doesn’t matter who.)  Unfortunately though, there isn’t a particularly good solution to this problem. Privilege is an important part of understanding social order, and inequality, but as it stands, the popular discourse around privilege weighs too heavily on the side of attacking and invalidating the experiences of the “privileged,” which only serves to push people away from these movements. Being attacked for something you can’t control isn’t going to drive people to be introspective about what good has come to them, it’s going to make them associate movements with the personal attacks they faced from their members. And ultimately, the whole discourse turns into people arguing that they lack certain privileges, or people arguing that their privileges don’t matter or aren’t relevant, both of which are terrible for the discourse.  In the end, I don’t think any of this is relevant to the anti-SJW circlejerk. I think that’s a movement born from good old fashioned racism, sexism and homophobia that has been taken up by people who want to be angry, and don’t want people to judge them or say that they aren’t the good guys. Then they turn it all into a conversation about censorship and whenever anyone calls them out, the retreat behind the “No, we aren’t racists, we’re trying to talk about ethics!” bastion they’ve built so no one can touch them. They go off on terms like “privilege” not for the valid shortcomings in discussing disadvantage through that lens, but because they refuse to admit that they have things pretty good and aren’t in some constant fight for their rights and freedom.  TL;DR: Long rambling post. “Privilege” has a complicated place in discourse that I think isn’t totally positive, but that opinion is irrelevant because the anti-SJ crowd only hates it because they can’t admit they’re not the underdogs fighting the good fight."

That seems remarkably uncharitable after you yourself explained how the situation can be way more nuanced.   A lot of these modern fault-lines like gamergate vs. SJWs, mensrights vs. feminism, atheism vs. atheism+ (or whatever that conflict is called), etc. seem to me as a bystander something like authoritarian-left vs. libertarian-left. Of course some conservatives and right-libertarians wander in and take common-cause against their perceived enemy (which is just ""the left"" to them), but the majority of at least those groups I mentioned seem to be generally unpolitical mildly-left/centrist liberals to full-on left-libertarians. Here's apparently a plot of a bunch of gamergaters' political compass results. I don't think the political compass is quite tuned to pick up this distinction (I think their version of authoritarian is somewhat tied to 'traditional social values' rather than maybe more modern 'you're with us or against us' / 'ends justify the means' / bullying / silencing / shouting-down / etc. authoritarianism). But at least it's something like that.  This split causes a lot of cognitive dissonance, and not because those left-libertarians are all closeted misogynists & racists. Most of them will usually say 'yeah I thought I was mildly/solidly left/liberal/progressive before, but now I don't know'. They see this new wave of people coming in with rather unpleasant attitudes, black & white unskeptical logic, and mob bullying tactics, who certainly call themselves the left (wearing it as a badge of pride). Meanwhile the right-wingers are all too pleased to agree and call those same new wave of social justice twitter activists 'the left' (using that group to tar the left generally). And the authoritarian-left (or whatever, maybe there's a more charitable way to phrase that) takes the lazy (/smart?) route of just declaring everyone who isn't with them as bigoted right-wingers.  Anyway I just meant to say that the plain left-right spectrum seems woefully inadequate to capture the nuances of this subject.

TrueReddit,3diqus,triplehelix_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:43:44 2015 UTC,"Her speech wasn't about just the US, so I'm a bit confused on who you mean, can you elaborate?"
TrueReddit,3diqus,bisonburgers,4,Fri Jul 17 18:43:34 2015 UTC,"her speech is honestly not at the forefront of my mind after the time that has gone by, but i remember the overall feeling that she talked about how men need to work with women to better the situation for women, and effectively brushed over any issues men face as a means to benefit women with no ""formal invitation"" to women to help men, while framing the whole thing as a push for gender equality.  she effectively did what so many individuals and movements that are supposed to be about gender equality, she focused on women and any aid to men is a means to the end of helping women, all while propping up the bigoted perspective of male oppressor, female victim:   We don’t often talk about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes but I can see that that they are and that when they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence. If men don’t have to be aggressive in order to be accepted women won’t feel compelled to be submissive. If men don’t have to control, women won’t have to be controlled.   it is an offensive perspective on gender equality when one gender is so massively overvalued and the other continually painted as a villain.  women need empowerment and opportunity, men need to be taught that they don't have to be overbearing controlling pieces of shit.  i agree that globally in many countries women face real oppression, and change is needed.  anyone helping these women move beyond being property, helping girls get an equal education, etc, has my full and unwavering support.  i absolutely disagree that women haven't achieved equality in the US, or emma's native UK as she offered.  both genders face issues, and the most likely will unto eternity.  i'd argue that the issues men face in the US are more dire than those that women face, and deserve attention in their own right, not as a means to further aid women."
TrueReddit,3diqus,triplehelix_,2,Thu Jul 16 20:21:46 2015 UTC,"I personally would not have phrased my sentence the same way Watson did, I agree that her speech was focused on women, and I agree that men face challenges that need to be eradicated, and those should not be ignored. There were also a lot of critics saying she did not specify gay or trans people or people of color in her speech either, whether their inclusion was implied or not depends on the perspective of the listener (though I do think she could have made more of an effort to mention them, personally). Concerning her focus on women rather than men, her speech was for a campaign called HeForShe run by the UN Women division, and I'm sure you are not forgetting the forty-nine other countries besides the US and England that she is representing as an ambassador. I cannot say that her campaign is inherently sexist for having a focus on women, in the same way I cannot say a movie that doesn't pass the Bechdel test is inherently sexist. Having said that, I believe you might be interested in this Times article that seems to fall in line with what you are saying. I quite enjoyed the article, and I think you will too. In the end, I think we want the same thing, but we find it so easy to get offended when someone is going on a slightly different path, and especially when we are not personally represented in that person's chosen path. I think Emma Watson's speech is a really really great step in the right direction, and I also agree with you that it could have been more progressive. But I will not dismiss it so easily simply because it falls just a bit short of what I would consider the best (although it is important to talk about where it falls short, I think, like we are now).  Also, somewhat relevant, I will add, in conversations of race, I do feel sometimes like my opinion as a white person is simply irrelevant. I think this must be similar to how men feel in gender issues sometimes. If it at all helps to bridge a gap between how I feel and how you feel, I've come to realize, after thinking about it a LOT, that there is so much I can't possibly understand having not gone through the same experiences. Things can be explained to me, sure, but it is not the same. I try to be an empathetic person, and yet it has taken me an embarrassingly long time to realize how little I really understand about what it's like to not be white (at least in the US). Race and gender issues overlap, but of course are not the same, so I'm not saying ""as a man, you can't possibly understand!"" (I've been assuming you're a man, but wouldn't it be funny if I were wrong!), but what I'm saying is we can't assume we know the ""other side"" as much as we think we do, and I think both sides forget this more often than not.  You will have to try harder to convince me that HeForShe is a bad thing. I've come to realize that although I, as a white person, am not the focus or center of race conversations (and I don't think I should be), it doesn't mean I'm excluded from them. I think it might be a good thing if everyone became a touch more humble and accepted that he or she will not be the center of every issue and accept that sometimes not being at the center is a good thing."

The issue comes when people conflate the academic sense of a word with the common usage. People are guilty of doing this all over the political spectrum and their rains fit doing so range from an ignorance of the difference to a wilful misuse for political gain.   Let's talk racism. ""Black Americans"" as a group, cannot be racist against ""White Americans"". They lack the institutional power. However, a black person can be racist, even against a white person. You make a good point about many conservative arguments seeing people as existing in a vacuum, but at the same time, many liberal academic arguments get lost in the macro. Individuals of any background can hold negative prejudices and to say that that isn't racism because racism=power+prejudice comes off as weasel word semantics to a lot of people."

I think that the larger issue is that many people see the first example, ""Black Americans"" vs ""White Americans"", as an example of weasel words as well.  Words have power, that's the whole reason why this argument exists in the first place. And ""racist"" is one of the most powerful ones we have, coming complete with feelings of bitterness and connotations of real evil. When someone like me labels the new, social justice definitions of racism as weasel word semantics, it's because the only practical effect that I can see is to relieve some groups of the discomfort that comes with those words, for the purpose of rationalizing the same hateful behaviors. It seems pedantic in the best light, and more often just seems malicious.  The same social and academic distinctions could be made with modifiers to the word racism. The creators and purveyors of this ideology chose not to do that. Why? My instincts say because in that scenario the ""R"" word would have applied to them as well. The conclusion that I draw from that is that the entire purpose of the philosophy of conflating racism with structural power was to weaponize the word without giving up the philosophies it would cover.  I'll be honest, I don't know enough about the origins of this field to know if that analysis has any basis in reality or not. And I'm open to being proven wrong, maybe the language plan really does work better this way. I do think that it's suspect, and that the burden of evidence should fall on disproving weasel-word intentions. But in any case, it's why by BS-meter spikes into the red whenever I hear the arguments, I think it's why a lot of other people feel the same way."

I wonder if you can answer this for me, because I find I fall into a somewhat strange situation in life.  I am white, male, cis, straight, the whole thing. I am not overly paranoid, but I recognize that I am not the favorite flavor of person for some groups. However, I am also trying to become a kindergarten teacher. I am part of a teacher's union and work in an environment that I recently saw listed as being 99% female. (Oh shit, I just realized that I'm the 1%!)  I don't like to bother even thinking about the ways in which I have the cards stacked against me, and I sometimes wish I could be better at something else, but this is a job I like, so I'm probably just gonna stick with it.  Anyway, my question is: what are the power dynamics in my specific situation? Strangely, I sometimes feel like if I were a different race, I'd have a better chance. If I were a different gender, I definitely would. If I were gay, I am unsure of any advantage since many of my student's parents are fairly conservative immigrants from various countries that don't like gay people.

The assumption that the appropriate role for women is taking care of children, which screws women over in the job market as a whole, benefits them here.  Similarly, because 'women's work' is seen as lower status than 'men's work', people (men and women alike) will wonder why you, a man, are accepting a lower-status job, and look at you suspiciously.  Nevertheless:   I don't like to bother even thinking about the ways in which I have the cards stacked against me, and I sometimes wish I could be better at something else, but this is a job I like, so I'm probably just gonna stick with it.   Good for you, man!  That's exactly the attitude you need to take.  For yourself, you do you, and you do what makes you happy.  For society as a whole, your choice is fighting back against the shitty 'men's work' and 'women's work' traditions and the classist assumptions surrounding them.  A woman being a miner or construction worker, a man being a kindergarten teacher or nurse, both challenge entrenched gender roles and, drop by drop, make those stereotypes weaker and weaker."

Somehow SJWs are ""controlling language"" as a weapon yet anyone else who uses specific language isn't? It's like, folks come up with certain terms to articulate ideas, that's kind of how all language works; it's not unique to social justice. But you know, folks will go to great length to absolve themselves of responsibility.."
TrueReddit,3diqus,silent_h,39,Fri Jul 17 06:34:46 2015 UTC,"The problem comes when these terms are used to dismiss or derail an argument. If I were to say my female employer is sexist because she offers preferential treatment to my female coworkers, there's little value in discussing how she can't be sexist because she's not as privileged as men. At best it adds very little to the conversation and at worst it's used to distract from the fact that she's prejudiced.  It's no different than using specific language of any study out of context to change a conversation, it's the difference between connotation and denotation. Colloquially we use a lot of words out of context, it takes the ability to judge whether or not there's any value in correcting the speaker or if you're just being pedantic."
TrueReddit,3diqus,ChefCrunchyRoll,27,Thu Jul 16 19:32:18 2015 UTC,"You're right, but the issue is that SJWs aren't using ""specific language"". They're taking already existing words like 'racist' and 'privilege' and turning them into something else. Doing this means that the other group of people in the discussion will inevitably use these general terms and the whole discussion will get sidetracked so that, instead of discussing the issues at hand it turns into an argument over definitions.  A good example is happening with the gay marriage discussion that's going on right now. There's a lot of people saying ""we shouldn't even be using the phrase 'gay marriage', it's just marriage!"" Which is correct. 'Marriage' applies to straight couples and gay couples. But 'gay marriage' is still a useful phrase, since there is a difference between a man marrying a man and a woman marrying a man. The difference is their gender. Specific language is good. General language is also good. Gay marriage is marriage, but marriage is not necessarily gay marriage.  Similarly, 'structural racism' is racism, but racism is not necessarily structural. Sure, we could call black-on-white racism ""Disenfranchised Racial Frustration"", but it's just a euphemism for racism."
TrueReddit,3diqus,hallflukai,-2,Fri Jul 17 08:26:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, anyone can use social justice language in anyway they want but when you're familiar with the discourse, it's clear that there are certain ways these words are used and they articulate specific concepts. I get that fighting over definition is a bit of waste, though. I wonder though, are they taking words that already exist? Or, were these words created as part of the social justice discourse and have since been redefined by dominant culture? I honestly don't know so maybe my point is wrong here. But, at least for me, the ideas of liberal humanism (that everyone is/ought to be equal or treated equally) caught on much faster than actual practice. Did people talk about eliminating systemic forms of oppression for marginalized communities and come up with terms to articulate this oppression first, or did philosophers decide that all humans are ""equal"" and then created terms describe discrimination first?"
TrueReddit,3diqus,silent_h,25,Fri Jul 17 16:01:08 2015 UTC,"it's clear that there are certain ways these words are used and they articulate specific concepts   Here's the clear point. Language is based on common usage and general acceptance of terms. If I could magically make everybody starts using the word ""teakettle"" to a baseball field, then teakettle would mean the exact same thing as baseball field.  The words SJWs are arguing about already have common acceptance of definitions. Racism is generally accepted as 'race-based discrimination'. Privilege, although not as steadily ingrained in the common vernacular, is generally accepted as a set of advantages you get from some factor. ""Class Privilege"" is the social advantages you get from being in a certain class.  The issue is, SJWs aren't just saying we need a new word for black-on-white racism, they're saying black-on-white racism doesn't need a word because it's not a real thing, and that racism may as well be used only to describe systematic race based discrimination. Since black people are not in control of the system, they cannot be racist.   On your second point, like the author of the article said, the origins don't matter, what matters is the current commonly accepted usage. This is why ""nigga"" is such an interesting word. It's origin is ""nigger"", of course, and I don't think I need to go into explaining the original connotations of that term. But now, the common definition of 'nigga' is shifting. Its racial undertones are still present, but far lessened. And black people being okay with white people saying it isn't the effect, it's the cause!   The thing about the rebranding SJWs are doing to these words is that it's not an organic cultural shift. In internet terms it would be a ""forced meme"", which is actually a terrific way to put it if you use Richard Dawkins' original definition of ""meme""."

If a word is defined one way in science, and differently when speaking colloquially, no one is claiming that one usage is wrong and the other is right. They coexist and are acknowledged as being reserved for different contexts. The problem with many disadvantaged people is that they aren't willing to make that same compromise or to compartmentalize contexts.

It seems like it's impossible to have a civil conversation (including well argued disagreement) on the internet without some idiots derailing it, be it either the SJW or the anti-SJW variety (for the lack of a better word). There were some legitimate counterarguments to 'motte-and-bailey' raised there when suddenly some men became 'triggered' and getting into the useless discussion of whether rape or genital mutilation should be discussed for one gender only.  I think we have to be careful that we don't use terms like the hereby introduced ""motte-and-bailey"" as a non distinguishing weapon just like some of the mentioned SJW sites use ""privilege"" or ""racism"". As an example, when activists are trying to discuss female genital mutilation and some guy interrupts with but what about circumsition, shouldn't we... and the group shuts him down with arguments on why this isn't relevant, it's too easy for something like ""motte-and-bailey"" to just become another thing to shout from the rooftops.

If they'd only target actual ""SJW"" I wouldn't have an issue with it, but it seems like they're trying to derail ""normal"" feminist discussions that aren't out to label or attack anyone - just like SJW seem to target legitimate MRA groups.

(I think I first noticed this when reading the debates surrounding ""elevatorgate"": feminists fighting for their right to be left alone, men fighting for their right to start conversation, and nobody willing to give up any ground, empathize, or seek compromise.)  That said, the problem is that it is difficult to separate each camp  into the ""rationals"" and the ""crazies"": someone who believes in social justice and the existence of patriarchy may be a perfectly good person, or they may believe that all men are rapists. Someone who tells men not to get married may support divorce law reform, or they may be trying to turn themselves into a psychopath in order to get women. (Sometimes, they are perfectly good people within their own communities, and when they meet someone they disagree with all hell breaks loose.)  And of course, within each camp the crazies often couch their rhetoric in something that sounds reasonable, but signals radicalism: ""women are adults, too"" or ""rape victims should be listened to"".

TrueReddit,3diqus,Godspiral,22,Thu Jul 16 21:53:10 2015 UTC,"He isn't talking exclusively about Tumblr or any online community, he's talking about social justice movements as a whole, and the mindsets that are common throughout them. You may find it insulting that he lumps these people together as one monolithic thing, but anyone who's observed the goings on of social justice movements lately cannot possibly believe that there are a wide and varied set of political thoughts or combative tactics that are used--it's almost always, without fail, the same narrative, the same opinions, the same accusations, the same general ideas over and over again without much change. I'd be interested to find a medium where social justice people are disagreeing with one another, challenging one another's views, allowing their own views to be challenged by outside sources, or fairly participating in conversations where they do not control the discussion. Since this thing is so hard to find, and what we generally see is a big singular mass opinion that is shared unanimously throughout the movement(s), it's easy to lump everyone together. For a group to not be treated as a monolithic entity, it usually requires a show of openness to alternative viewpoints, the lack of a singular, homogenous base set of opinions that everyone shares.   Literally how GamerGate and the Men's Rights movement operates, only instead of disagreement and memes and pushing for equality and fair treatment, they insist on maintaining an agenda that is both a symptom of and responsible for the systematic oppression of women, minorities, and the underpriviliged.   This is bogus and so far out in wrong-territory it's not worth addressing. It's strange that you even bring these things up, since Scott made no mention of them and doesn't back either of these camps. If you can't adequately address a criticism of social justice without baselessly attacking two other unrelated groups, then it suggests you're lacking substantial defense. These things  have nothing to do with what he's talking about.    If you're tarred with the brush of being a racist, priviliged, elitist jerkbag and can't defend yourself - you probably are. And if you're not, then anyone whose opinion is worth considering will recognize that.   This misses the point entirely. ""If you can't defend yourself"" is exactly the thing he is talking about. In my 11 years of experience, I've not once met a social justice crusader who is fair and level headed enough to sit and listen to someone they've just accused of being racist or sexist try to defend themselves against slander or abuse. Not once. That scenario goes one way, and it's met with loud, obnoxious insistence that a person is inherently sexist and/or racist, and no amount of honest rebuttal will appease the accuser.  The kinds of people Scott is talking about are the people who throw around words like they can invent the meanings after the words land, arbitrarily assigning meaning to them once they see how that meaning will be most beneficial. He's not talking about honest, fair people who delightfully engage in open and  honest conversation about ideas, or people willing to see more than one side of every issue.   He's made it very clear who he is talking about, and the problems associated with their tactics. If you're not guilty of the same 1984-ish tactics that he's talking about, then don't take offense. Those who are guilty need be the only ones taking this to heart."
TrueReddit,3diqus,derpyco,6,Thu Jul 16 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"To address just the first point,  White privilege doesn't actually exist. Legitimate complaints about affirmative action aside, Black oppression DOES exists.  Whites may enjoy the lack of oppressive incarceration rates, military membership, police attention, fear-based avoidance, concentrated ghettoization, innadequate education systems, violent environments of desperation, and welfare traps placed around them to keep them poor, all of which are systemically intentionally inflicted on blacks and somewhat on other ethnic groups.  But a lack of oppression is not privilege.  To call it privilege is to call a perfectly fair outcome one where whites are oppressed just as much.  On an unrelated note regarding privilege, having a job is a privilege if other people would want your job, and could obtain it if you were removed.  But its an individual privilege that is not automatically oppressive of everyone who did not win the job opening.  The definition for privilege that the author accepts as ok, is very wrong and dangerous.  ""You are derailing what I am talking about by bringing up counterpoints"" is me making a claim that I have the privilege to talk and you have the oppression of being forced to listen to me.

If its oppression we talk about, and you believe you're not an oppressor, then you don't have to reckon with it. It's not your fault, so why engage.   Do you get that that itself is the very reason the word privilege is used? So that everyday folks with privilege - white people, straight people, the able-bodies, men - can see that their inaction adds to the status quo, which puts others down, and effectively supports the oppressive norm.   To say it isn't privilege is to completely miss the point. Fixing the issue isn't about silencing the nasties. It's about getting the masses to realize their acquiescence to the system that oppresses certain others is as bad and problematic as doing the oppressing themselves."

TrueReddit,3diqus,Godspiral,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"My feelings about privilege are similar to how I think plenty of Christian/religious people view being ""blessed"" - whatever their situation may be, they're blessed and fortunate to have what they have, and they feel a duty to help the less fortunate. I think it's a useful way of thinking in terms of being a moral person, and (as a straight white dude) I feel fine with the general concept of privilege being used as the sort of secular equivalent, but it's too bad that it seemingly gets used as a weapon so much that it drives people away.   Myself, when I started hearing about privilege I also thought it was stupid and counter-productive and tuned it out, but I guess I've been warming up to the idea over the years. I think it's a convenient concept to use when you look at, e.g., Jeb Bush saying the problem with the American economy is that people just don't work long enough hours. This is a guy who is unfamiliar with the struggles of the average/poor American because of his privilege of growing up well taken care of. It's not bad that he had all he had, it's only bad to be unaware of it, because it leads to that complete lack of empathy.   And for ""normal"" people, yeah, I grew up lower class in a single-parent household, but I was one of the lucky people who was healthy and smart and had support and yada yada. I could complain that I worked to get everything I have after growing up without much, which is inarguably true, but it doesn't mean I understand the far greater struggles of people who had even less than me - I'm still privileged in a lot of ways, and acknowledging that is important for me to be able to understand e.g. the struggle for gay equality or the riots over shooting of black people. Not acknowledging that is saying ""We're all the same, what is all their whining about?"" and prevents me from actually understanding what other people are going through, or being able to meaningfully contribute or at least not get in the way."

There may be people born with unfair advantages, but its not a race-based privilege to be that lucky.  We can discuss policies that equalize opportunity, but anyone's disagreement with you is not automatically invalid because they are less oppressed than you.  The main and most important point is that accusing some one or class who is less oppressed than you are of being privileged is an argument of petty jealousy.  It is not an argument that you are oppressed, and that you should stop being oppressed.  Its an argument that is solved if I get oppressed just as badly as you are.  Its a demand that I owe you my stuff only because I have more, or even the more absurd, I owe you something because my class has more than your class.  There are excellent arguments for redistribution at /r/BasicIncome .  They are equalization of opportunity, the freedom from desperation as a life motivator, and the freedom from obtaining permissions to survive, and there is a funding flow primarily from the successful to the less successful.  But its not an argument for equality of outcome, or that you deserve my stuff just because you have less stuff.  To OP's topic though, SJW accusations of privilege is nazi supremacism.

TrueReddit,3diqus,TheCodexx,2,Fri Jul 17 03:39:31 2015 UTC,"I have found a concrete example of where words are used or interpreted quite differently from their commonly held definitions, the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (IRMA). Scoring the scale is quite simple, the more you agree with an item the more you accept rape myths and support rape culture.  I am going to use expanded definitions in place of the words being used to describe a concept to have a closer look at the IRMA.  In terms of definitions I think that everyone can agree on the most part about the terms rape and acceptance, so what is a myth? According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) a myth is:  > 1. A traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining a natural or social phenomenon, and typically involving supernatural beings or events. > 2. A widely held but false belief or idea. [1]  First things first, is the term being used consistently with it's common meaning?  > Within the traditions of psychology, sociology, anthropology, and philosophy, the concept of myth is theorized to constitute (1) false or apocryphal beliefs that (2) explain some cultural phenomenon and (3) whose importance lies in maintaining existing cultural arrangements. When this idea of myth was then combined with the cultural theory of rape, the following definition was proposed: >  >>  Rape myths are attitudes and beliefs that are generally false but are widely and persistently held, and that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression against women. (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1994, p.134). > > Such a definition of rape myths bears more than a coincidental similarity to the notion of stereotypes. Like stereotypes, the importance of rape myths lies not in their ability to truthfully characterize any particular instance of sexual violence; rather, the significance of cultural rape myths is in their overgeneralized and shared nature as well as their specified psychological and societal function. [2 pp 29-30]  The answer is clearly no, the term myth has been redefined as synonymous with stereotype, for which the OED definition is:  > A widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing. [3]  There are a couple of items in the IRMA that I take an issue with, the first is question 22:  > 22.Girls who are caught cheating on their boyfriends sometimes claim it was rape. [4]  Let's look at the OED definition of sometimes and it's synonyms:  > Occasionally, rather than all of the time. >  > Synonyms: occasionally, from time to time, (every) now and then/again, every so often, (every) once in a while, on occasion, on the odd occasion, at times. [5]  Substituting the synonyms gets you:   Girls who are caught cheating on their boyfriends occasionally claim it was rape. Girls who are caught cheating on their boyfriends on the odd occasion claim it was rape. Girls who are caught cheating on their boyfriends at times claim it was rape. etc   So is this item actually a myth (in the dictionary sense of the term) or a stereotype? Looking at numerous reports in the media (Daily Mail, St. George News, Daily Mail, St. Paul Star Tribune, Folkestone Herald, Grimsby Telegraph, Metro UK, and many more), no it isn't either. The unfortunate reality of it is that women sometimes, occasionally, or on the odd occasion do make claims of rape to cover up infidelity.  I don't know how you can even score this on a scale of strongly agree to strongly disagree, it either happens sometimes or doesn't happen at all, it can't have anything other than a yes or no answer. What I take issue with is that if I strongly agree with this item when there is strong evidence to support my position, I believe in a rape myth. If the item was written as ""Girls who are caught cheating on their boyfriends claim it was rape"" or ""Girls who are caught cheating on their boyfriends often claim it was rape"", my answer would be strongly disagree and we wouldn't even be having this discussion. What a difference one word makes.  I also have issues with item 6, but that is a discussion for another time.  Other rape myth acceptance surveys have similar issues, such as the Acceptance of Modern Myths About Sexual Aggression (AMMSA). The AMMSA scale is another positively scored research instrument used to research the subject and uses not only things considered false or stereotypical, but those considered ethically wrong.  >  In rape myth methodology prior to the Acceptance of Modern Myths about Sexual Aggression (AMMSA), a minimum stipulation was that rape myths needed to be demonstrably false. Significantly however, the AMMSA and others move away from this: for their purposes, ‘it would be more expedient to define rape myths not as false, but rather as “wrong” in an ethical sense.’ [6]  Then you have a look at the research instrument itself:  > 6. It is a biological necessity for men to release sexual pressure from time to time >  > 21. A man’s sexuality functions like a steam boiler – when the pressure gets too high, he has to ""let off steam"" [7 pp 2-3]  I mean really? Doesn't everyone get sexually aroused or feel horny at times, sometimes with no rhyme or reason, and is masturbation ""wrong"" in an ""ethical sense""?  Sometimes I wonder if these people even live in the real world at all.   Oxford English Disctionary - Myth Payne, D. L., Lonsway, K. A., & Fitzgerald, L. F. (1999).

TrueReddit,3diqus,OfficerMudkip,20,Thu Jul 16 19:51:59 2015 UTC,"I think this was a good article, but I also think the use of words as weapons is not limited to the social justice movement. It's everywhere, and context is everything. Calling something or someone ""liberal"" can be a completely objective, harmless description or it can be derogatory, depending on context and usage. Same with words like feminist, conservative, Republican or Democrat. Or you can make mention of habits or behaviors that do the same. For example, from my experience, indicating someone uses Tumblr on Reddit is essentially the same as dismissing them and their opinions, and I see the reverse happen as well on other sites regarding Redditors.   I don't think it is controversial to say that this subreddit leans ""anti-SJW"" in terms of posts and comments that get voted on, so I would just caution readers to be aware of their own biases. Much of what Scott Alexander describes in this post describe the actions of people besides those in the social justice movement.   What we are really talking about here is co-opting terms for the use of in-group vernacular that simplifies dismissing the opinions and experiences of other people. Words like racist, privilege, sjw, or feminist are helpful for cementing your ties to the rest of your in-group, because it quickly demonstrates your allegiance (and the rest of your in-group rewards this sort of thinking through the incentives of the internet, be it likes, shares, upvotes, or whatever). But this sort of usage is also exclusionary, and is at cross purposes with reaching an understanding. Focusing too much on who is right or wrong is a dead end, ""us vs. them"" mentality, when our goal should be listening, understanding, and working for everyone's mutual benefit."

Now women are accounting for more than 75% of new OB/GYNs. Considering the interest levels of men and women getting into the field and the comfort level of some patients being affected by the gender of their doctor it's easy to assume that the equilibrium would be heavily favoring more women OB/GYNs."

TrueReddit,3dms2w,Ahhuatl,3,Fri Jul 17 22:53:25 2015 UTC,"I watched the section in question, it doesn't demonstrate anything particularly groundbreaking - certainly not anything that supports the thesis being forwarded here.  The fact that biochemistry influences the rate of development for certain social skills and in turn behavioral tendencies is not controversial nor does it demonstrate that complex decisions like career choice are rooted in biology.  Quite the opposite, I'd question the framing of the experiment we are presented with.  A newborn looking at faces or looking at a ""mechanical object"" (whatever that is) does not inherently say anything about gender, even if there is a sex disparity in the results.  The researchers have simply selected two subjects which we - the enculturated masses - associated with one gender or the other. Our gender biases leads us to associate women with socialization, men with the mechanical, so when we hear that female babies like faces and male babies like machines, we interpret that as a demonstration that our gender constructions are innate.  We can however catch these biases by changing altering the associative connections we are making.  In fact, we can even invert what the conclusions of the experiment seem to suggest about gender roles.  Suppose it is revealed that the machines these researchers showed these babies were, sewing machines, hairdryers, and a vacuum cleaners. Suppose it is revealed that the faces shown to these babies were those of athletes, scientists, and politicians.  With this new information, what now do the results of experiment imply?  That male babies are predisposed to the traditional domains of women and fashion?  That female babies have a strong interest in athleticism, science, and politics?  In both the vague experiment we are shown in the documentary and in this refined hypothetical the subject matter is the same (machines and faces) and the results are the same (a sex divide) but what has changed is the framework we use to interpret the results.  A newborn has no grasp of the social role of a machine nor what the social perception of a face is.  All an experiment like this establishes is that there may be a sex divide in what babies pay attention and that can be interpreted in any number of ways which have nothing to do with gender roles.  Interest in differing kinds of geometry, sensitivity to movement, differing reactions to spatial orientation, heightened attention to sound, and number of factors could account for the responses of these babies.  Both the framing of the experiment and the conclusions that are being drawn here strongly hint of a confirmation bias; that the researchers went looking to substantiate their preconceptions about gender, (unintentionally) built an experiment that would lead them to believe that the results proved those preconceptions were correct, and then jumped immediately to the conclusion they were looking for without looking for other interpretations in an objective manner.  Actually, that isn't entirely fair.  If you pay very close attention to the video, the researcher being interviewed actually forwards an interpretation that is counter to the thesis you're defending here. Starting at 24:43:   ""...we found that the children who had higher testosterone have more difficulties with empathy, with recognizing other people's emotions, or taking other people's perspective.  But they also have a much stronger interest in systems and understanding how things work. So even if you ignore what sex somebody is and look at their hormone levels you can predict their patterns of interests.""   What is extremely important here is that he is not talking about sex at all but rather how a certain hormone impacts the development of all babies.  In fact, just prior to the quoted section he discusses how female babies can have levels of testosterone which lead them to behave in the same manner as the male babies.  This explicitly demonstrates that the biological component of human development in this circumstance is not an immutable and rigid function of sex but rather a spectrum of hormonal levels which can lead females to, in the words of the researcher, have very ""masculine"" preferences and conversely influence males to have feminine preferences.  The implication of this is very much in line with Feminists argue.  The association of certain behaviors with masculinity is a social construction, one which describes not divergent differences rooted in sex but rather a selective bias.  But lets contextualize that last statement before going forward.  The reactionary, anti-egalitarian individuals among us look a gender disparities in professions and say ""there are more men in X profession and more women in Y profession, that means that men like X and women like Y.""    In actuality, the fact that there are ANY women in profession X or ANY men in profession Y empirically demonstrates that such generalizations are false.  In actuality, neither sex has an inherent predisposition towards either X or Y but rather socialization and biochemistry produce a spectrum of predispositions that don't fit into the unscientific gender binary.  All of the above is of course me giving the experiment the benefit of the doubt - we are presented no information about the sample size or the exact methodology so there is little grounds to concretely scrutinize the experiment.  I have seen nothing in this documentary that weakens my initial suspicions about it.  The documentarian misframes the research and takes it a direction that grossly exceeds what the experiment actually demonstrates.  The conclusions that underpin the documentary are both unscientific and a terrible disservice to humanity.  What is the documentary-maker fails to highlight in this piece is that the researcher in question speaks of development delays, slowed progress, and varying levels of interest.  That biochemistry impacts the rate of how each sex develops is a totally mundane observation.  The fact that one sex develops certain skillsets at a slower rate than others is less important than the fact that all sexes eventually reach developmental maturity in adulthood (collectively speaking).  Likewise, having less of an interest in something during a period of development and hormonal fluctuation does not mean that an individual won't eventually become more interested in something or that the level of interest they do show isn't enough for them to pursue a particular career.  Anyone arguing the contrary is simply using some very sloppy reasoning and very selective interpretation to make their point.  There are countless examples of women discussing how gender boundaries have prevent them from entering fields and countless studies that reaffirm the cognitive biases which underpin that.  There are also comparable stories from men, but unfortunately the so-called ""Men's Rights Activists"" are too busy trying to enforce traditional gender roles to help the men who have been victimized and humiliated by them.  Regardless of how one interprets their experiences, these people would not say that they were forced into careers their penis/vaginas apparently hate by ""le evil SJW/Feminazi/Cultural Marxist/Man-Hating/American-hating/liberals"".  They would say they pursued (and have struggled unjustly) certain careers of their own accord.  Far from nullifying my overall position, if we take the science presented in the experiment you highlight as valid, then my position is valid.  If we do not, my position is valid.   All that is missing is evidence of your interpretation, which this study does not present.  ""We followed these kids up until their eight years old"" is not an empirical substantiation of the claim that the biological trends noted here persist until adulthood."

You've pulled the same kind of BS that all deniers of anything do: claiming the lack of 100% conclusive evidence is proof of the opposite.

TrueReddit,3dms2w,Ahhuatl,0,Fri Jul 17 19:29:33 2015 UTC,"You've pulled the same kind of BS that all deniers of anything do: claiming the lack of 100% conclusive evidence is proof of the opposite.    Not at all. As I stated in my post, if the conclusions of this experiment are correct then they actually jive quite well with what I believe.  When I explore the possibility that they are incorrect, I do not say ""that demonstrates that biology has nothing to do with gender"".  I actually state:   ""All an experiment like this establishes is that there may be a sex divide in what babies pay attention and that can be interpreted in any number of ways which have nothing to do with gender roles. ""  They keyword here is ""can"".  We can interpret the data in a number of ways, come to a number of conclusions, that don't have to with gender.    ender traits of course exist on a spectrum, but that doesn't mean we can't acknowledge trends.   Quote me where I say we cannot acknowledge trends.  There is a difference between acknowledging a trend and building a gender around it. When a boy is disinterested in sports, is not muscular, and wants to pursue a career in fashion, society's reaction isn't ""oh, he is an outlier, how interesting.""  Its ""he isn't a man, he is a pansy.""  The subsequent bullying and ostracism that boy experiences is the direct result of how we construct gender.  Not biology.   It is not the acknowledgement that there are trends and that there is variation, it is an oppressive denial of variation that teaches males that they somehow are wrong, that they are not men, because they aren't part of the trend.   If high testosterone leads to a certain set of traits, we can call these male traits; to argue otherwise is to claim that men aren't taller than women because Gwendoline Christie is taller than me.   The logic behind your argument is not sound.  I am rejecting the absolutism of the claim ""men are taller than women"".  There are many cases where this statement is not true, therefore it is not accurate to use it as a categorical indicator.  Lets tackle this another way.  If I were to say to you ""flying is the trait of an insect"" you would recognize that statement as problematic.  Not all insects fly and not all flying organisms are insects. The claim does not accurately describe the subject, nor all related subjects.  Now suppose you point this out and I respond by saying ""Yeah well the majority of flying creatures are insects, so we can call that an insect trait"".  Sure we CAN call it an insect trait but doing so serves no purpose, it has no value.  It doesn't help us understand flying creatures or insects.  It in fact poses us another questions: why is it so important that we call flying an insect trait?  Why the obsession with making that delineation even though it is not accurate and leads the uninformed to have an incorrect understanding of insects and flying?  Or to put it another way, why is one trait categorically meaningful but another is not?  You're more or less defending the gender binary, but why aren't you articulating a height binary?  Aggression, lifespan, physical capability, and even some mental attributes are related to height, so why is having a penis enough to justify some admittedly obtuse yet hard division of society but not height?  There is of course no good reason beyond the fact that we are familiar and comfortable with gender divisions but not height ones.   This is not denial of anyone's right to do anything (despite your claims to the contrary and attempted shaming)   Your argument is merely wordplay, so let me turn it back on you.  Show me where I  state that a recognition of sex-trends is a denial of rights.  You won't be able to but the reason why you made that argument is ironically the same reason why what you're claiming here is meaningless.  Just because a statement doesn't overtly say something, that doesn't mean it can't be interpreted to mean something.  So the anti-egalitarians out there have observed that recognizing gender differences isn't rhetorically the same as promoting inequality, good for them.  An objective and honest thinker will recognize that in the real world, people build on and reinterpret claims.  Just as you've unintentionally built on and reinterpreted what I said in a way that leads you to think I meant something I didn't, so too do people do the same with the averages business.  War and sports are a perfect example of this.  On average, females are indeed muscular than men.  But if people are only interpreting that as a trend, an average, not an absolute statement on what women can do, then people should be entirely open to the possibility that there is an outlier among females that would make an athlete that is just as capable as a male athlete.  I challenge you to go to any of these anti-egalitarian subreddits and make that claim.  I challenge you to say ""Women can be just as fast and as strong as men, and therefore the gendered division of sports is wrong"".  You won't be greeted with thumbs up and nodding heads.   You'll be bombarded with arguments that conflate the average with an absolute to the point of absurdity.  You'll have plenty of scrawny men with low testosterone asserting that men are invariably better than female athletes and that they could defeat any female Olympian if they wanted to.  That isn't an acknowledgment of differing biochemistries and a recognition of a trend and any argument to the contrary is either made by a dishonest or woefully naive person.   Given the dismissive and downright hostile nature of much of this post, especially the last couple of paragraphs, it would behoove you to spend more time examining your own clear biases instead of vomiting pseudo-intellectual nonsense onto the internet   A charming display of hostility and hypocrisy which signals the end of this conversation.

There are countless societies where what we define as feminine is the domain of men and what we define as masculine is the domain of women.

TrueReddit,3dk79u,binarywizzard,14,Thu Jul 16 22:55:01 2015 UTC,"World-wide, there are 967 businesses founded prior to the year 1700 (and dating as far back as 578) that are still in operation today. Astonishingly, 53% of them are located in one country: Japan.  Japan contains eight of the world’s ten longest-running businesses (all founded prior to the year 800), including the world’s oldest hotel, Nisiyama Onsen Keiunkan, a hot spring that has been in continuous operation since 705. But what has allowed these businesses to survive for so long?  One possible answer: adult adoption. Today, a whopping 98% of Japan’s 81,000 adoptees are males between the ages of 25 and 30, many of whom are businessmen who are legally adopted by the owners of corporations and put in management positions. This way, the “family owned and operated” claim technically remains intact, without the risk of passing on a legacy to a less-than-capable son or nephew."

Are you freakin kidding me?!?!  That little two inch buck knife you keep in a pocket as a matter of habit, yeah, you're a criminal in the NYC. Obviously this statute has been kept on the books as a means to charge people when the NYPD has neither a decent case on other charges or nothing else to charge someone yet still wants to leave a ""lasting"" impression.

TrueReddit,3dg4sj,BorderColliesRule,94,Thu Jul 16 01:49:47 2015 UTC,"What I inferred was that they are supposed to flick it with the blade closed. I would not doubt that police would test it that way in the field either in ignorance or malice. The hinge screw on the knife could always be loosened later to secure a conviction, but most people don't have the resources for a proper trial anyway.  This is what bothers me the most. Everyone involved is not adhering to the spirit of the law. This paragraph of the piece was telling:   If it takes repeated tries to get a knife to open, maybe it's not a gravity knife after all, they argue. But the statute doesn't say a knife has to open easily with a wrist flick, or that it has to be designed to open that way. Even if an officer can't reproduce the ""flick"" in court, that's not always a successful defense. On the witness stand during a trial in 2003, a police officer demonstrating a knife's ""flickability"" managed to get it open on only two out of eight attempts. The defense moved to strike the knife as evidence, arguing that the failures were prima facie illustrations that the knife didn't meet the definition. But the judge denied that motion, ruling instead that the knife had simply ""malfunctioned."" That defendant got six years in prison when he was convicted.   There are supposed to be safeguards in the justice system. When the police, the DA, and the judge are all on the same team, its 3 against 1 for those accused. All it takes it 1 person in the chain to stop an unjust conviction; The police, the DA, the Judge, or the Jury and all of them fail to see what is blatantly wrong.  Common sense is abandoned for arrest numbers and conviction rates. The story had one judge who saw through the bullshit and nullified a conviction in the interest in justice. The world needs more people like that, and more people should educate themselves on the topic of Jury Nullification."

JOHN LOCKE (Second Treatise of Government): ""Yet the legislative being only a fiduciary power to act for certain ends, there remains still in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative, when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust reposed in them....And thus the community perpetually retains a supreme power of saving themselves from the attempts and designs of any body, even of their legislators, whenever they shall be so foolish or so wicked as to lay and carry on designs against the liberties and properties of the subject.""

The entire NYC NRA debate alreadsy happened, and was front page news in every newspaper and mass media outlet for a couple of years. ''four punks threatened and attempted to rob their victim, but enclosed within that graffiti encrusted rail car the ""hare turned around and bit the hound"" he fired his Smith and Wesson 5 shot 38-caliber revolver into his would-be muggers. The bumper stickers were everywhere in NYC - ""Ride with Bernie -- he Goetz 'em""! The crime rate in the dangerous subways plunged dramatically -- so much so the authorities even held back the numbers -- the truth hurt too much.  Bernie Goetz wasn't caught immediately. It was a brief hiatus allowing the incident to grow into an international media sensation. During a White House press conference in early January Sam Donaldson asked President Reagan his position on the ""Goetz shooting."" The next day a young NRA political director held a news conference at the Park Terrace Hotel on 7th Avenue with Roy Innis, National Chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and State Senator Chris Mega from Brooklyn declaring, ""A government which cannot protect its citizens has no right denying them the means to protect themselves""! The famed journalist Murray Kempton asked if he was urging vigilantism? His retort, ""when will Mayor Koch provide the same level of protection to the citizens who ride the subways and pay their taxes that he enjoys surrounded by a phalanx of New York's finest, oh with guns at the ready""? '' http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-feldman/bernie-goetz-the-subway-g_b_6369128.html Sorry to burst everyone's hopes that the NRA will waste time thinking about the most racist and closed minded city in the US, or bother with them in any debate. It happened long ago and NYC voters are all about Nazi control. I'm 51. I remember when NYC was an awesome place filled with interesting people. Now it is all super uptight rich people who want everything to be like Mr Rogers, in a major city. Most of them want hunderds of new laws to be passed, both republican and democrat.

Some blog coverage of it all here with links to the Village Voice.  The NRA, and the Second Amendment Foundation (notable for not blaming violence on videogames, to my knowledge), both really seem to concentrate on guns. I dunno why, it seems like banning knives, or brass knuckles, or whatever, and banning guns goes hand in hand.

The point of the article is that the gravity knife law is so old, people don't know what it means anymore, so it's being misinterpreted to arrest and convict people who are not actually carrying gravity knives.  FTA:   When gravity knives were banned under New York State law in the 1950s, the legislature actually had a very specific style of weapon in mind -- a foot-long terror that bears no resemblance to a knife like the one Neal had. True gravity knives, for all intents and purposes, have been extinct for the better part of a century; today they're relegated mostly to the antiques section on eBay.

Well, there is, the right answer is that the jury is supposed to act as they are designed to do: uphold the law as it is written.  Jurors are screened for preexisting biases that could influence the case for that specific reason.  While you could argue it's morally just all you want, nullification really is just you putting your own opinions and standards over that of the law. 12 people shouldn't be allowed to just make up the law as they go along.  For every 'bad case' thrown out because of nullification, how many innocent people are jailed because 'well he looks like a nigger', and 'well guns are evil, and that guy owns guns, so fuck him'? They both are essentially the same thing.   Maybe the person who voted to send a black guy to death row mostly because of the color of his skin was also influenced by a lengthy list of priors, and the juror was concerned with accidentally letting a dangerous killer free who could kill again. Maybe the person who wanted to jail the 'gun nut' really does believe that guns make people evil, so fewer gun owners ultimately makes all of society safer. Both could rationalize their decisions in ways that could be seen as 'morally just'.  They're the same thing, and for every person who wants to let a black guy rot in a hole because he's black, there's probably a person who wants to let a black guy off scot free because 'blacks have it so tough already and the cop is white'. Neither of these people is correct."
TrueReddit,3dg4sj,TotesMessenger,3,Thu Jul 16 11:14:04 2015 UTC,"Jury nullification is not contempt of court, if it was you could be jailed for it.    If the only thing the jury is for is weighing evidence, why not just have the judge do it?  Judges are supposed to be impartial after all.  Law is important but sometimes morality trumps law.  If I'm on the jury for the trial of an escaped slave, I'm probably going to acquit."
TrueReddit,3dg4sj,_ernesthemingway,10,Thu Jul 16 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"This right here is why we have a problem with law enforcement in this country. It's all a matter of incentives and annual reviews. And really it's a problem in every industry, but in this industry in particular, it ruins lives and gets people killed. Everyone wants to be good at their job. Every manager wants an easy way to measure if someone is good at their job. It makes their job easier because then you can just look at some numbers, instead of actually interacting with your employees and watching what they do. So how do you tell if a cop is doing a good job? You count how many tickets he writes, you count how many people arrests.  As an employee, who is given goals (not quotas of course because those are illegal) you do what it takes to meet those goals. If you give someone a number, they'll find a way to meet that number, even if that number really doesn't tell if they are doing their job right or not. So you want to meet that number, but there just aren't enough bad guys out there for you to arrest? what do you do? you find some other reason to start arresting people, or writing more tickets. and you are rewarded. and others see you get rewarded and want to get rewarded as well. And then you have laws like this that are nothing more than harassment and excuses to raise some number. These people aren't dangerous, they don't deserve to be arrested, and certainly don't need to be incarcerated. But it gives the cops more arrests so the cops can say they are doing a good job. Then the police chief can say that he's doing a good job, and the DA can say that he's doing a good job, and the politicians can say they are doing a good job and everyone is happy, except for the people who are getting screwed over so that so many others can get raises and pats on the back. If we want to stop the violence, and the harassment and the negative image the police have, we have to change the entire culture.  Police are taught that they are there to catch the bad guys and take them off the street. Then everyone who is not a cop becomes a potential bad guy, and everyone who isn't a cop becomes afraid of the cops. Police are there to protect and serve. When they approach someone they should be thinking how can I help this person, not I wonder if I can arrest this person. Once you make this change, the world becomes a much nicer place."
TrueReddit,3dg4sj,URSOMAD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:57:29 2015 UTC,This. Fixing the law around knives misses the systemic problem of incentivising police to overreach in the name of meeting numbers and providing them with the right to conduct invasive searches.
TrueReddit,3dg4sj,_ernesthemingway,51,Thu Jul 16 15:00:56 2015 UTC,"Well, much of the point of stop-and-frisk was to run a police state (for some) where non-whites could be searched at will by police and arrested for piddling offenses.

Many poor whites are in the same boat as poor colored people and treated the same.  I don't deny that color is a factor, or that racism exists, but I believe the police oppress those with lower socioeconomic status. What skews the statistics is that most poor people in urban areas are colored.  I thought this graph was more accurately illustrative of the racism, while this graph is likely skewed by the demographics of the poor neighborhoods.  This is always a touchy subject, but I sincerely feel that we should confront issues of official oppression as something that can happen to anybody. White people should not feel immune to this."

TrueReddit,3dg4sj,LennyPenny,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:35:28 2015 UTC,"The original motivation seems to have been the now largely discredited ""broken windows"" theory, that visible minor disorder gives people the impression that no one is in charge and misbehavior is normal, causing people to commit more crimes. By the time it was implemented, the overt rationale had shifted partly to the idea of ""quality of life"" policing: cracking down on nuisance behavior.  As stop-and-frisk played out over the years, it seemed that the sustaining motivation was really that police could make lots of arrests and confiscate lots of guns and contraband, on the theory that ""taking guns and criminals off the streets"" would improve safety. Stop-and-frisk made it a lot easier to rack up seizures by effectively legalizing police searches without probable cause. The crime rates of 1975-1995 were terrifying to many Americans, and New York was a rough place. It's very hard to jail criminals if you afford people all of their constitutional rights. It's a lot easier if you (usually accidentally) wrote the laws so that everyone is doing something illegal. Then you can haul in anyone you suspect."

The kitchen knife one is an example from an actual client. I guess a more common example would be carrying a sheathed knife on your belt. If your shirt accidentally becomes untucked and covers the knife, then that can count as concealing it."

They had belt clips on the back of them that you could unacrew and take off if you didn't want it.  But that screw would also loosen the blade, and you could loosen it so that you could flick your wrist and lock the blade."

A privilege is inherently unfair and it should ideally be abolished. What white people experience shouldn't be presented as a privilege, it should be presented as the norm, and what non-white experience presented as a disadvantage. The problem is not ""white privilege"", it's ""non-whites disadvantage"", because what we call ""white privilege"" shouldn't be taken away from whites, it should be given to everybody. By changing the rhetoric you wouldn't alienate poor white people by telling them they are ""privileged"" but you could still make the point that non-whites aren't treated fairly.

Privilege implies that someone has something they shouldn't rather than experiencing something everyone else should also experience. It's backwards thinking, like crab mentality.  Do white people have an advantage? Yes. Should they? No. Do they have a privilege? Only if you assume that being mistreated should be the norm and everyone should be treated equally poorly.  In my opinion, we should lift everyone in society up to the best possible situation in terms of equal justice, equal rights, and fair opportunity rather than trying to pull everyone down to equal misery and unfairness through poorly chosen terminology."

I've lived a relatively privileged lifestyle vs a poor white person, because I haven't faced the financial difficulties that they have. I've had educational opportunities that white people in poverty have not had access to. You could argue that class privilege/socioeconomic privilege is more of a life-determining factor than racial privilege, although the two are often inextricably linked; if you and I were walking the halls of a newborn nursery in North Baltimore, I would be able to predict certain facets of those babies' futures simply based off their last-name/skin-color with a fair degree of confidence, and that's a major problem.  On the other hand, I'm fairly certain that poor white person didn't get the flak that I got(and continue to get) after 9/11 based off the fact that my skin is brown, and I'd be willing to bet that police judge me quite differently than they judge him/her.   I'm straight, so I've never been discriminated against on the basis of my sexuality. I'm a man, so I don't have to worry about many of the issues women have to worry about(although there are obviously certain areas where women enjoy privilege relative to men, such as in paternity hearings or paternity leave). I'm able-bodied, so I don't face many of the issues that disabled individuals face.  When people say ""check your privilege"", it's a cry for practicing conscious empathy. Before you make any judgments, really put yourself in that other person's shoes and try to understand the obstacles and disadvantages they've had to overcome in their life.

Some people really can make the best of a bad situation.   At the end of the day, I've accepted that I fall on a continuum. Some people have it better than me and others have it worse. So long as race doesn't factor in to the ability of someone to take advantage of an opportunity, I'm fine with the fact that some others get opportunities I don't. Sometimes you have to be in the right place at the right time and only one person can be there.   Instead what I see is people blaming others for their shortcomings.

The idea that the well-connected and extremely wealthy are the only ones who can buy their way through things is an easy perspective to have when you're a part of the middle class.  Someone growing up in a poorer urban neighborhood probably looks at the access to better-quality public schools in the suburbs, or the ability to pay for a public university, or the ability to not have to work while in school as unfair advantages that the middle-class have access to in the same way middle-class people look at campaign donations, private schools and debt-free graduates.  Edit: Also worth pointing out things like the paragraph above this one are what people generally mean when they criticize someone else for 'being privileged.'

In most of the cases where someone claims that their whiteness meant that they couldn't have an opinion, it happens in a specific set of circumstances that are justified. There certainly are kinds of knowledge that white people will not acquire just by living their daily life (just like without listening to Tibetan monks' accounts of their lives, I can't know certain thing about what life is like for a Tibetan monk, by virtue of who I am and where I live in the world).  So, it isn't that white people can't have opinions about political or social things involving ethnicity. If that were true, then there wouldn't be hundreds/thousands of well-respected white scholars who speak about ethnicity.  Here are some examples of things that one can't know by virtue of being white: ""microaggressions are made up because I don't see them!"" (microaggressions are invisible to people who are not the targets and don't care about them) ""When I think about american black culture, I think it's bad and needs to change!"" (a stable and monolithic ""black culture"" only exists on the television-- there are as many diverse ways of living for black americans as there are for any other group. For every black ""gangster"" who looks down on education, there's a white ""gangster"" who thinks the same thing, or a white neo-nazi, or a white homophobe).

What it means, though, is that if a white person's argument for one of these things revolves around their ""experience,"" i.e., ""I don't see how slavery is important, so racism is over"", then their opinion is not a very good one (because of the nature of knowledge and experience-- I could here bring up Levinas's ""face of the other"" (hey, a white* guy!))."

I just think that it's a notion coined by and for the habitually offended, and whatever power it has is rooted in the deliberate misrepresentation of the intent behind colloquial speech.  It is, at its essence, the most pure form of irritating ""GOTCHA"" - almost nobody committing a ""microaggression"" means any offence, and in fact given a chance to flesh out their words and clarify exactly what they meant it usually won't amount to a ""microaggression"" at all.   And that's the real source of irritation: nobody wants to talk like a wordy, annoying SJW. Nobody wants to have to focus on filtering every single word before they say it just so that some hyperoffended weiner won't jump up on a technicality. And to the extent that you try and force people to do so, you're going to get significant backlash against the very idea of ""microaggression.""

You're referring to things like ""hold on a cotton-picking moment"" (which is a messed up phrase, but could be said innocently).

TrueReddit,3dgg4j,strangedelightful,83,Fri Jul 17 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"Good article. When I got my Bachelor's degree (first in my family, second to finish high school!), I happened to be dating a girl who was legally blind. We owed about the same amount in student loans, but she magically got about 2/3 of her debt wiped for being blind and a girl. Meanwhile, I was pumping off job applications like a machine, and lucky to even get a response (i.e. rejection letter). It took a few years to get over this idea that the biggest thing holding me back was the fact that I'm a white male, with no obvious handicap -- no grants for me, no affirmative action, no doors open. It seemed unfair that, in the position I was in, it was assumed that my frat buddies would just hand me a job, that doors would open; but that wasn't the case. Why is she (nearly) debt-free, while I have this massive burden of debt and no easy fix?  Well, like I said, it took some time, but a couple things happened: first, I came to realize that everything this article describes is true: even though I didn't have this ""good ol' boys"" network behind me, I was starting from zero, not the negatives. Second, just because I was in the debt I was in, and had agreed to, didn't mean she should be dragged down with me: I should be happy that she had her burden lightened, regardless of the burden on my shoulders. But most importantly I think, is that it made me think hard about class, as well as intersectionality (I don't think that was a word then). My struggle was similar to that of many others, but also different. Begrudging her wouldn't help me or her.  Class is a difficult concept to get a handle on in these times. But our class never negated the privileges I was receiving (hard as they were to notice) as a result of my gender and skin colour. Eventually those things helped me, for sure. And in the end we're all just trying to do our best. It's not a zero-sum game."
TrueReddit,3dgg4j,cranktheguy,26,Sat Jul 18 07:18:29 2015 UTC,"Class is a difficult concept to get a handle on in these times.   It's really not. It's far more quantifiable and concrete than the concept of privilege could ever be. There are a couple of definitions that vary somewhat but the similarities are more predominant. It's no longer a formalised system like in feudal times, it's very much in the realm of economics and realpolitik now. You may ascribe to the classic Marxist definition of ownership of the means of production or the more specific working/middle/upper model. Basically your net worth is the highest indicator of class. That is perfectly quantifiable. Do you live paycheck to paycheck, with only your vocational skills to pay for your living expenses? Do you own a home? Do you own companies? So basically it's your wealth and what your wealth can facilitate that determines class. This then extends to sway over politics and ability to impact on the economy. All this affords you the ability to have influence over people. The more of that you have, the higher class you are.  Privilege on the other hand is far more nebulous and in my view a useless political analysis tool. So little of it is actually verifiable and sounds more like the language around bs corporate speak like lost profits and opportunity cost than credible political theory. It's entirely based on assumptions about the person you are having a debate with and none of it is easily proven. Do I know for sure that you were handed opportunities when others weren't? Do I know that cops don't give you as much of a hard time as I imagine they do to others? Hell no. Those things I infer when talking to you completely based on my own prejudices and info I found to back those up. You know, like a bigot would. This is even more absurd when it comes to arguments via text like right here on reddit and other communication platforms where all you really know of the person you're interacting with is words on a page that they give you."

In modern America class has significantly more to do with the opportunities you'll have and the hardships you'll face than race or gender. Don't get me wrong, there's totally shit that a middle-class black guy growing up in suburbia will have to put up with that a middle-class white guy won't, but that probably doesn't even amount to a tenth of the bullshit that the poor black guy growing up in the inner city has to deal with that neither of the middle class guys do."

Some of the points she makes are good (not being singled out) but a lot of others don't make a lot of sense. My Irish heritage didn't form this country, nor does it matter to me what race I can hang out with. Additionally, seeing my own race on the news doesn't change anything if it's about a white guy shooting up a theater. Regardless, no one can deny there is some advantage to being born white. It is a case-by-case basis for each individual, however, and can not be equally applied to the entire race itself.  White people (such as myself) do not need to be ashamed of white privilege, but they should recognize it. Just like a male should recognize that there is certainly some degree of male privelige in the world. How much is actually out there is subject to debate, but it is present. Females receiving female only scholarships or disabled having debt wiped away (as another commenter stated) are also priveliges that the individual should be aware of.  Am I saying it's better to born x race or y gender or z orientation? No, rather that all of these areas can experience varying degrees of innate advantages that they should be aware of, but not ashamed of.

Here's the thing: white people don't really care when a white person has committed a high profile crime, because they just call that person ""mentally ill"" and have done with it-- they don't have to carry around any social baggage.  When minorities see a high profile crime committed by a minority, they often have a sinking shitty feeling, because they know what the mediascape will be like for the next month (i.e., ""thug culture is getting out of hand!"" ""he/she committed this crime because of his/her culture!).

Do the people whose hands get chopped off need to be aware of their privilege over the people who get their hands and feet chopped off because they're born to the wrong tribe? Where do you draw the line?   In my opinion, the concept of ""white privilege"" seems to be an easy crutch used by activists to invalidate the opinions of others because their views can simply be written off as the products of privilege.

You can help the problem by working on your denial. It is natural to feel defensive when a group you see as your people (however you choose to define ""my people"") with is spoken of negatively. Recognise that defensiveness isn't going to help, it isn't about you personally, you are not under attack, and try and come to a place of calm acceptance that the problem exists.   Listen politely, with your new calm acceptance, when people who are differently privileged talk about their experiences and don't feel the need to tell them they are wrong or try and change the topic to how your group have it worse.

I would never argue that AS A WHOLE white people have it bad but there are certainly situations where they are treated unfairly or at least perceive to be.  There are also things that are truly CLASS issues that are mischaracterized as RACE issues simply due to the fact that there are more poor black people. I think it is unfair to poor whites when the solutions are targeted at race and not the source of the problem which is class. I think this is the problem Bill Burr sees as well.

White people have the privilege to interact with the social and political structures of our society as individuals. You are “you,” I am “one of them.” Whites are often not directly affected by racial oppression even in their own community, so what does not affect them locally has little chance of affecting them regionally or nationally. They have no need, nor often any real desire, to think in terms of a group. They are supported by the system, and so are mostly unaffected by it.  What they are affected by are attacks on their own character. To my aunt, the suggestion that “people in The North are racist” is an attack on her as a racist. She is unable to differentiate her participation within a racist system (upwardly mobile, not racially profiled, able to move to White suburbs, etc.) from an accusation that she, individually, is a racist. Without being able to make that differentiation, White people in general decide to vigorously defend their own personal non-racism, or point out that it doesn't exist because they don't see it."

The story you link to makes perfect sense to me.  Cops came to the location to investigate reports of a person having a gun, and came to a scene where a kid was in fact brandishing a gun that looks exactly like a real gun.  Maybe when it is your ass on the line you will approach an armed person to check things out and only shoot when they point a loaded gun exactly at you, but not everyone wants to put their life on the line to ""investigate"".  By the time you get to this scenario, it's a matter of tactical semantics.  The real problems - kid with airsoft gun brandishing it in a high crime, high gun area - came before that.  This is not a failure of cops.  This is a failure of parents, who brought up a kid who has access to unmarked airsoft guns and hangs out in parks brandishing said guns.  Ghetto culture = ghetto results.     they won't immediately think they need to shoot him instead of controlling the situation and properly assessing risk   I lived in the ghettos of NYC and DC.  Cops will stop thinking they need to shoot poor people in the ghettos when the ghettos stop being infested with criminals.  These are high crime areas, with tons of drugs and tons of guns and shootings.  I've lost count how many people have been shot within 5 block radius of me during my lifetime.  Think about that for a second.  Cops act similarly on edge when they go to white trailer park trash areas.    It has very little to do with race, and everything to do with socioeconomic status.  USA is a very unequal country and the ghettos/trailer trash parks/etc that are unmatched in the developed world.  It is ridiculous to expect cops to act the same way in Ghetto/Trailer Park as they do in Picket Fence, America.  The risks are different, and policing is going to be different as a result.  The biggest problem in America is not race, but inequality.  (And that includes poor white people, too.) If you solve that issue, there will be no race issue."

TrueReddit,3dgg4j,zombie_toddler,17,Thu Jul 16 12:53:32 2015 UTC,"I define white privilege to be [...]   A lot of people believe fetuses are humans (and therefore, abortion is murder) not because they are, but because their communities defined it that way. A lot of people think marriage is between a man and a woman not because that's what a marriage is, but because their communities defined it that way. Every time a Republican stands up in front of a crowd and says, ""I define marriage to be a union between a man and a woman,"" is your opinion changed? Or do you sit back and say, ""Well actually, your definition is stupid and wrong. That's not what that word means."" That's what is happening right now.  Most people have a good working definition of the word privilege. They use it in everyday language and people understand them. They can tell their kid their playtime privileges have been revoked. Their lawyer can tell a judge that they have attorney-client privilege and he can pound sand if he's subpoenaed to testify against his client. They can look it up in the dictionary and say, ""Yup, that's what that word means."" Here's what that dictionary says:    a right, immunity, or benefit enjoyed only by a person beyond the advantages of most:  the privileges of the very rich. a special right, immunity, or exemption granted to persons in authority or office to free them from certain obligations or liabilities:  the privilege of a senator to speak in Congress without danger of a libel suit. a grant to an individual, corporation, etc., of a special right or immunity, under certain conditions. the principle or condition of enjoying special rights or immunities. any of the rights common to all citizens under a modern constitutional government:  We enjoy the privileges of a free people. an advantage or source of pleasure granted to a person:  It's my privilege to be here. Stock Exchange. an option to buy or sell stock at a stipulated price for a limited period of time, including puts, calls, spreads, and straddles.    None of those apply very well. #1 obviously doesn't apply since most people in the US are white; being white doesn't grant me an advantage over white people. #2 and #3 are legal jargon. #4 doesn't apply for 2 reasons, 1) because white privilege isn't all that special (because it could only ever afford me an advantage over a relatively small percentage of the population) and 2) because it isn't an immunity. I still have to bust my ass to keep the power on. #5 doesn't apply because ""all citizens"". #6 might confuse people, but the example sentence clarifies it; they're talking about privilege as the stupid platitudes people say, not actual privileges. #7 is .. well yeah.  That's what the word means to average white guys like me, who went to average public schools and got average grades and got average jobs. A privilege is something very special and very powerful. A privilege is something which dictates your position relative to your peers. And white privilege is none of those things.  Basically, you're the megachurch pastor on the radio whose argument is, ""Well actually, abortion is murder, because it's defined that way!"" to thunderous applause. And here's the thing; that might be a perfectly good definition for you and yours. But to me and mine, you might as well be claiming that the sky is green. And if you want to stay in your echo chamber and complain about the world, while people like me go about our business oblivious to you and your plight, the fact that your argument is completely, totally, utterly meaningless to my worldview is perfectly fine. But if you want to change my worldview, if you want to change my perspective, if you want to influence my actions, you will need to stop speaking your language and start speaking mine."

So if you're a poor American Asian and sit around thinking about how much you hate white people and treat them like shit any chance you get, you're apparently not racist.

TrueReddit,3dgg4j,skiff151,9,Thu Jul 16 12:58:56 2015 UTC,"Very few, class privilege is typically of larger magnitude, but even rich black people get hassled by cops a lot. They still get treated with suspicion by people in everyday life. If you're white, as long as you don't look extremely poor, you'll generally get left alone. Employees won't follow you around stores, security guards won't glare at you, etc."

TrueReddit,3dgg4j,reactor4,2,Thu Jul 16 09:30:53 2015 UTC,"Well, there are some advantages. A poor white kid probably won't face racial hatred from the majority of society, won't be mistrusted by the majority of society when simply walking through a store or walking down the street. I can hear you now: ""But neither will a black kid in a nice suit."" Not always true; how often do black guys get pulled over because they're driving a nice car and they're assumed to be drug dealers? How often have you heard the good ol' boys black joke, ""What do you say when you see a black kid riding a bike? Answer: Thief!"" But let's say that blacks are usually treated well when they're well dressed and well-manored: the point is that blacks shouldn't have to be twice as good and half as ""black"" to be treated well by whites.   But set all of that aside if you don't like it.   Let's say the poor kid has no advantages over the black rich kid.  It's still good to recognize as a white person in this country that you are only in as good a position as you are (whatever position that might be) because of this country enslaving and disenfranchising blacks for generations. My family may never have been as successful as they are if for generations they had not been considered the only people who deserve jobs and land and voting rights, as well as all of the tax advantages and other class privileges which, for a long time, were only available to whites, and which even today are disproportionately enjoyed by whites, because it's so damn hard to dig one's self out of the ghetto.  If I'm a poor white kid looking up at a rich black kid, I'm looking at a triumph of that black family against all odds. Our families' stories are not equal. Their family didn't get rich because of an advantage they had over mine historically: they got rich despite a severe disadvantage. Whereas if the roles were reversed, it would be very likely that the black family could just as easily have ended up rich if they hadn't been oppressed.   Should we congratulate ourselves that America has progressed to the point where there are some black people who now tower over white people in terms of money and authority? Sure! It's a big deal! But we can't forget that the statistics we all know about the ""black community"" in America are not created in a vacuum. Even though many of these young gangbangers grew up in the Obama era, they're still products of the poverty and ghettos whites relegated them to in the past. Just because we didn't do it ourselves doesn't mean we shouldn't recognize that we benefit from it: we wouldn't be where we are now if not for that pillaging and racism. And if we don't spend serious time and effort and even money attempting to make up for it, then we are, if not racists, then accepting of racism. And I'm not saying it's easy to get out of that. It's a burden no white person born today should have to face, because they didn't do anything to deserve it. But if your father stole your neighbor's life's savings from their house safe before you were born, and used it to put you through college and buy you a car and your first house, all the while that neighbor's child grew up on food stamps making ends meet with dead end jobs in a rat-infested studio apartment, and then you found out about it, wouldn't you have some responsibility to do something about it? Even if you lost all of that money in the stock market and were no longer rich, wouldn't you have some responsibility to help that neighbor's child? To help them up? To, at the very least, admit that you still, even today, even in ruin, had more chances in life because of their misery?"

On the contrary, there's a bunch of people like yourself who remind the rest of us whenever they get the chance.    isn't that about not hurting black feelings?   So here's a thought: systematic discrimination in hiring, housing (and thus by extension education), finance, law enforcement, etc. inevitably have the result that blacks perform worse than whites on a variety of measures. This in turn justifies further discrimination (""why should I give this guy a loan when no one will hire him?"" etc.), thus creating a vicious cycle.  So maybe it's about ""feelings"" than it is about the concern that some might use it as a justification for racism - the sort that creates a self-perpetuating vicious cycle."

Why do you feel comfortable saying negative things about Indians that you wouldn't dare to say about blacks?   As for your accusations, yeah we are ""backwards chauvinists"". We're realists. We come from a harsh part of the world, you have to deal with reality as it comes or you suffer the consequences.   As far as body odor, some of these people come from places where they still shit in holes in the ground. Why would you be surprised that their hygiene is still lacking?   Here are the facts. Blacks are 12% of the population, they commit some 50% of the murders, rapes, and assaults. That's reality. Blacks in the 90th percentile of income commit more violent crime than whites in the bottom 10th percentile. That's a fact.   It isn't poverty, or lack of opportunity. It's an endemic shitty culture, that glorifies violence and ignorance. More programs and money aren't going to fix it. Promoting the myth of black victim-hood only makes it worse.

I'm not really worried about being murdered by blacks or by whites. It's still a rare thing. On the other hand assault, robbery, and harassment aren't. I've lived in heavily black neighborhoods, harassment by blacks is a daily fact of life. I went to a high school that was 80+% black, it was horrible and violent.   I can count the number of times I've had problems from white people on one hand. Blacks were a daily annoyance or threat. My neighbors were black drug dealers running a dog fighting operation. When they had a lot of people over I'd seriously have to wonder if a bullet was going to come through my wall.   I'm a racist because I've spent more than a decade of my life around them.

When reconciliation is necessary, each side starting by airing their grievances almost never completes the process.  It usually just ends with everyone leaving the table in a huff.  It precludes understanding and empathy because each side feels misrepresented and mischaracterized.  Starting with places of agreement, like how the police are over-militarized and targeting citizens, to build common ground, and then allowing each side to examine and voice their own introspective criticisms is usually a better way to go.  Allowing an uninvolved third part to then make observations on internal consistency and fact-checking in a non-confrontational manner is about the only way for every one to listen.

Despite what the Charleston Massacre makes things look like, people are dying not because individuals are racist, but because individuals are helping support a racist system by wanting to protect their own non-racist self beliefs.

Despite the fact that where there's presumably no racism - in Africa - life is even worse for blacks. Maybe life sucking for blacks is due to the poor ability of blacks to cope with life. Life is an IQ test, after all.  If individual whites are racist against blacks, it's because blacks are racism-worthy. Because prior and collective experience with blacks gives them a reputation that makes reasonable people, without yet knowing anything about the individual, lean toward a negative outcome from whatever the interaction with the black is.   edit:   within a racist system (upwardly mobile, not racially profiled, able to move to White suburbs, etc.)    Now having seen what he claims is systemic, I don't see wtf he's talking about. Racially profiled because you happen to be part of a disproportionately criminal race; that sucks, I can partly sympathize, but the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. The rest, well, it just says that blacks can't succeed on their own. A recent comment by Jesse Jackson made it clearer - he was talking about how white businesses move out when a town gets too black (and said there should be a law against it!). Well, if blacks are so equal, why can't they just step up? The same thing here. ""We blacks are pitiful and helpless, we need to be near whites, getting white help"". As an ugly racist expression goes, blacks are all 'gibs me dat'."

TrueReddit,3dg0xm,klafka,5,Thu Jul 16 07:40:11 2015 UTC,"I understand and agree with many of the comments posted here about how the article barely scratches the surface of the issue. Obviously, many of the SF housing market distortions are ultimately responsible for soaring real estate prices, however well the city's original intent was to uphold affordable housing stocks. But in my mind, I feel that Airbnb and other similar innovative vacation rental services are unfairly being turned into a lightning rod for criticism, all the while the major elephant in the room is overseas Chinese investments. I mean this as wealthy citizens/residents from Mainland China heavily investing overseas, not Chinese-Americans or Chinese citizens who are living/working here in the US.  China (the country) has capital controls and an increasingly shaky economy that is contributing to capital flight overseas. As a result, the SF/Bay Area is seeing a surge of wealthy Mainland Chinese investors flocking to park their assets in real estate, driving up local housing prices, all the while leaving them uninhabited. It is frustrating as hell for actual Bay Area inhabitants in need of housing while a Mainland Chinese investor show up with suitcases full of cash and easily overbid those looking for a roof over their heads than an investment vehicle. Aside of individual real estate agents actively courting real estate buyers from China, the City of SF even has a dedicated economic development office to court overseas Chinese investment, which certainly seems to be in direct conflict with their mandate of protecting their own residents.   My opinion is that the city will need to choose their battles wisely and start putting restrictions on foreign investment properties, not on local residents who are trying to make their ends meet with rentals or on tourists that are helping to turn the local economy. Money is a helluva drug, and its certainly the cause of creating housing scarcity as well as an artificial inflation in value (not based on local market value)."

The problem is that all forms of media ""re-present"" the information as they are not primary sources, ie. introduce bias, give a preferred reading etc. This means they're really not good sources to make decisions on since you're more susceptible to the bias presented. It's always best to find the primary sources and see for yourself, if possible."
TrueReddit,3ddftl,Shledge,2,Thu Jul 16 14:02:13 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree. I mean, I definitely see your point, but I guess I have a strong feeling against the word-concept of ""bias"".   To make a simpler analogy, suppose you are thinking of watching a movie. Somebody else (a secondary source) tells you that the movie sucks. You disregard it as it might be biased and watch it anyway yourself (a primary source). You think it sucked. Then another somebody tells you that the movie was actually good because something you missed in your intepretation. You watch it  a few years later and you think that's spectacular.  So, what happens? Every reading of a part of reality is ""biased"", we all construct perspectives and perspectives of perspectives and so on. A secondary source, a reading that's not your own, might give you an insight or connect pieces that you miss on your very own reading, which is never going to be really ""unbiased"" since you also ""present"" things to yourself by intepreting those. And conversely, sometimes all the critics say that the movie sucked but when you watch it yourself, you actually find it was misunderstood."

Then another somebody tells you that the movie was actually good because something you missed in your intepretation. You watch it a few years later and you think that's spectacular.   Poor analogy. The bias in media is determined by how it is presented - ie. how the film is portrayed rather than a review of said film. If it's a review, it's obviously an opinion piece, but if an article says the film director slept with one of the actors simply because a photo could be interpreted as such... then that's bias.  This can be done in more ways than simple text - the use of colour, choice of photos etc. can determine the preferred reading the journalist wants you to follow. A perfect example of this is broadsheet and tabloid newspapers - broadsheets use more ""proper"" language and rely more on statistics, while tabloids rely on bluster and slang - which alone is enough to change how the story is presented.   So, what happens? Every reading of a part of reality is ""biased"", we all construct perspectives and perspectives of perspectives and so on.   Not if it's empirical. That's why primary sources, ie. the findings in a research paper (quantitative and qualitative data, usually), information written in verbatim etc. is more important than a few online articles - they are written down exactly as they were found. You can argue that bias can still be introduced, but that's why there are safeguards for this, ie. peer review (even if it can be hit and miss), experimentation to see if results can be replicated etc.   A secondary source, a reading that's not your own, might give you an insight or connect pieces that you miss on your very own reading, which is never going to be really ""unbiased"" since you also ""present"" things to yourself by intepreting those.    No real insight can be gained to be honest. However, it is a good way to get a brief gist of the information if you're having a lazy sunday afternoon or whatever like most people. If you value accuracy, go to primary sources.   And conversely, sometimes all the critics say that the movie sucked but when you watch it yourself, you actually find it was misunderstood.

Not everything can be measured. There is no such thing as raw evidence, evidence always needs to be interpreted. For example in this case, harrasment, what counts as harrasment and what doesn't cannot be simply measured, eventually it needs a finer reading. Someone insistently disagreeing with you on twitter is harrasment? Why? Why not? You could have two different people read all the unedited, raw tweets between these people and come to different conclusions. Even if you take metrics (I'm not sure what kind of metric would be appropiate in this case), there is no way to measure quantitatively if a metric is appropiate and/or relevant, you need to interpret it with reason.

TrueReddit,3ddftl,niviss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:17:52 2015 UTC,"Not everything can be measured.   You'd be surprised on what can be measured - thematic analysis, conversational analysis etc. are all methods to measure qualitative data, ie. conversations, a media analysis of a news article etc.   Empirical evidence can simply be audio transcripts in verbatim, numbers in findings etc - once it is recorded exactly as it was presented, rather than a slant be put on it. This is hard to do, but again that's why said safeguards exist.  Your view on how we interpret the primary source is correct, but it is a conclusion, not what the primary source actually presents. Any sort of primary source simply does not present any viewpoint, ie. the primary source merely only presents the information at hand. It's up to us on what to make of it, or interpret. Apply that to an online article, where an interpretation is already made by a journalist, then you're going into dangerous territory of bias.   For example in this case, harrasment, what counts as harrasment and what doesn't cannot be simply measured, eventually it needs a finer reading.   Which is down for the decision of the judge, based on the very same primary sources. He/she does not read an online article to make that decision.   Someone insistently disagreeing with you on twitter is harrasment? Why? Why not?   The evidence is that the argument happened between them (primary). To say whether it is harassment or not is the interpretation of that evidence (secondary). To put it off as harassment, with the pretense that it is fact, can be potentially bias.  A judge can be biased, but again, he/she will be looking at the primary sources, rather than secondary. Also, law is incredibly weird, even if we managed to be completely neutral.   You could have two different people read all the unedited, raw tweets between these people and come to different conclusions.   Correct. But to make conclusions on an article that already has a conclusion or some sort of bias is a different matter. To agree with a premade conclusion because it fits your own biases or viewpoints, rather than the other premade conclusion, without looking at the primary source, is where this confirmation bias can come from.   Even if you take metrics (I'm not sure what kind of metric would be appropiate in this case), there is no way to measure quantitatively if a metric is appropiate and/or relevant, you need to interpret it with reason.   Again, you'll be surprised. The tweets can indeed be measured qualitatively, ie. via thematic analysis. The simple occurrence of words in a certain frequency, the themes of the conversation etc. can give measurable findings.  However, to decide whether it is harassment, I already suggested to read the actual tweets over the online articles and make your own decision from there.   Again, you might read the primary sources and still fail to interpret something until someone else points it out to you.   To change your mind on something because someone points it out is another form of preferred reading, ie. they want you to interpret it in the way they did. This is fine once it's from primary sources, but as you said yourself, dangerous when it comes to secondary sources."
TrueReddit,3ddftl,catchandthrowaway,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:47:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can measure a lot of things on a conversation. But you cannot measure whether those measures or the thresholds you apply are meaningful and relevant, that's an additional, non-measureable interpetation. See for example how Steven Pinker thinks he can measure ""freedom"" and ""tyranny"". Sure, he can take a lot of sources and plot and crunch a lot of numbers, but his conclusions aren't ""objective"" and ""empirical"" just because he crunched a lot of numbers, they're still up for debate.  I agree that making up your mind about something based on what ONE journalist says, without thinking that there might be additional relevant information that you haven't taken into account, is a bad idea."

TrueReddit,3ddftl,ottawadeveloper,22,Wed Jul 15 19:04:19 2015 UTC,What? The word defense implies asserts that it's a two way street. He absolutely does have the right to defend himself against anyone. Especially confrontational activists who are admittedly the type to have a meeting where the goal is to plan an internet lunch mob to ruin someone's life.  He's not only entitled to defend himself. He's expected to.  These types of people will start an internet hate mob inciting violence and threats but when someone fights back it's harassment? That's not the way the world should work.
TrueReddit,3ddftl,Godspiral,9,Wed Jul 15 19:53:02 2015 UTC,"Canadian law (which is what matters here) talks about what constitutes harassment, so let's look at that for a moment (disclaimer: IANAL):  Criminal harassment     264. (1) No person shall, without lawful authority and knowing that another person is harassed      or recklessly as to whether the other person is harassed, engage in conduct referred to in      subsection (2) that causes that other person reasonably, in all the circumstances, to fear for their      safety or the safety of anyone known to them.     (2) The conduct mentioned in subsection (1) consists of         (a) repeatedly following from place to place the other person or anyone known to them;         (b) repeatedly communicating with, either directly or indirectly, the other person or anyone known          to them;         (c) besetting or watching the dwelling-house, or place where the other person, or anyone known          to them, resides, works, carries on business or happens to be; or         (d) engaging in threatening conduct directed at the other person or any member of their family.   In my mind, this means that the important questions are:   Does he know their behaviour impacts them? It seems like this passes (and so meets the ""knowing""). Does his behaviour on Twitter meet 2b (obviously a, c, and d have not been met)? This seems to pass as well, since he communicated with their audience via hash tags (it might be different if he did not). But it will be interesting to see if they consider this to be true, as it might set the standard for how Twitter behaviour is related to real life communication). Did they have ""reasonable"" grounds to fear for their safety? This seems sticky to prove and will probably decide the case.   From the tweets I saw, he seemed mostly interested in contradicting their point of view (a form of counter-propaganda), not harming them. Twitter provides enough of a boundary, in my mind, to make this acceptable behaviour - in real life, if I followed you home with a protest sign, that might change things, but that is because I am there and presenting a threat. If there are examples of threats, this also might be a different story. He didn't pursue her to other social media sites, he didn't bombard her Twitter account; he just replied to things he could see. And I suspect that this all means the answer to 3 will be ""No"", their alleged fear is not ""reasonable"" and therefore he is not guilty.  On to my personal viewpoint, with less law.  I, for one, would be worried if ""countering somebody's philosophy on Twitter"" became a criminal offense. It would mean that the type of campaign they were organizing, and many other types of activism on Twitter and other social media platforms would become crimes under Canadian law. I doubt the plaintiffs in this situation would want that (but I think it would be amusing, if they won, if the original target of their plans then pursued a legal case against them)."

Any of us who disagree with any politician or any of their supporters in what are PUBLIC internet forums would face this persecution by police and crown attorneys sympathetic to whatever group wants to silence everyone else.

Not a tough ruling at all, really. BUT for those who thrive on the drama and confrontation and use Twitter to push their agenda, it would seem seriously punitive.   Problem is, I doubt there is any way this could be enforced, and I have no idea if the judge would have the power to rule/enforce such a ruling."

For example this guy is getting charged for what amounts to having a long running and childish disagreement on twitter, while Ms. Guthrie openly and admittedly harassed the guy who made the anti-feminist game.

I feel like a person who wants to publicly state an opinion on this subject should know the difference between those things and not try to hide the differences. You're comparing things that can happen on a windy day with a high UV index to a gene that a bacteria got successful with because it helped the bacteria kill its host and feast on the deathly nutrients being inserted into our food so that farmers can increase pesticide usage and makes food more expensive.  And lastly, being against GMOs that allow farmers to dump glypohosate everywhere is not the same as being against GMOs on any other principle. You show me some GMOs which reduce water usage overall, increase nutrition, do not interrupt the wild genomes, and maybe some other positive traits and I'd be cool with it."

TrueReddit,3ddujb,outsider,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:50:38 2015 UTC,Hybridization is a way to promote traits found in one set of plants with those in another set of plants which are closely related at the species level. GMOs take genes from other species and inserts them into a foreign genome. Hybridization is basically how evolution works except humans are generally trying to select the traits that they want to get emphasized. Hybridization is also something which occurs in nature as well.
TrueReddit,3ddujb,Madmusk,2,Thu Jul 16 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it doesn't follow that hybridization is inherently safer. For one, it is less controlled in that we can combine closely related plants, but we can't predict exactly what we'll get. If I put the gene from Bacillus thuringiensis to produce an insecticidal protein in corn DNA, then I know the only trait I will have added is that which produces that protein. We already use Bacillus thuringiensis on crops as an organic farming pesticide. All we are doing is adding the trait of that bacteria which we already use in organic farming to the plant in a more efficient and targeted way.  Further, if one wanted to they could produce a toxic potato or tomato using only hybridization and selective breeding. It's entirely possible that our tinkering with plants through breeding could have unnoticed but nevertheless unwelcome effects on us. A more mild example would be that of hybrid varieties that are less nutritious than certain heirloom vegetables, yet people aren't asking for labeling of modern hybrids as such even though you can actually produce evidence of the nutritional deficiency of modern varieties."
TrueReddit,3ddujb,outsider,0,Thu Jul 16 19:53:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it doesn't follow that hybridization is inherently safer.   Why are you trying to rebut things I haven't claimed? The thing is that yesterday you thought hybridization and GMOs were basically the same when they aren't.   All we are doing is adding the trait of that bacteria which we already use in organic farming to the plant in a more efficient and targeted way.   Or how I look at it is that a gene which helps bacteria feed on the rotting insides of insects it kills is now in our food plants.   Further, if one wanted to they could produce a toxic potato or tomato using only hybridization and selective breeding.    Yes, and the lenape potato is a good example of the FDA regulating those lines.  I'd have had more concern for what you wrote if you weren't trying to confuse people by making it seem as though hybridization is a GMO technique."
TrueReddit,3ddujb,Madmusk,3,Fri Jul 17 09:50:02 2015 UTC,"Why are you trying to rebut things I haven't claimed?   When you say something like ""Hybridization is basically how evolution works except humans are generally trying to select the traits that they want..."" that implies that genetic manipulation that is more similar to evolution is in some way preferable to genetic modification performed more directly. Why would you point it out if you didn't think it made some sort of point?    Or how I look at it is that a gene which helps bacteria feed on the rotting insides of insects it kills is now in our food plants.   So yes, you obviously have an agenda, you just don't want to come out and say it for fear of having to defend it. That protein which is produced is so selective that it doesn't harm the majority of insects that ingest it. Even within the specific type of larvae that are targeted there's a wide range of effectiveness. We simply don't have the specific protein receptor that the Bt protein binds to. Not only that, like I said, we already use Bt in organic farming since the 1930's, so to eliminate it would be to eliminate one of our safest and most proven insecticides and would lead to more drastic methods being used which I'm sure the public would be less in favor of.   Yes, and the lenape potato is a good example of the FDA regulating those lines.   Yes, I'm glad you brought that up because it clarifies my point. It took years for the FDA to realize they needed to pull the lenape potato, at which point people had already been harmed.   When you breed for pest resistance through traditional methods you don't necessarily know what specific trait you're modifying. In the case of the lenape, they were taking a pest-resistant toxin that already existed in potatoes and affected a wide range of species and greatly increased it. That sort of thing would never slip through with a GMO crop. Both the EPA and FDA specifically test and approve the insecticidal GMO crops we're using. Good example!"

So yes, you obviously have an agenda, you just don't want to come out and say it for fear of having to defend it.    No you're paranoid. What I wrote is literally what that gene is for. The bacteria it is found in has had biological success because that gene kills insects when the insects eat something contaminated. A little while later the bacteria has killed the insect and in its decomposition its nutrient changes allow the bacteria it divides and divides and divides.  Here is the Wikipedia entry for it:    Cry toxins have specific activities against insect species of the orders Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), Diptera (flies and mosquitoes), Coleoptera (beetles), Hymenoptera (wasps, bees, ants and sawflies) and nematodes[citation needed]. Thus, B. thuringiensis serves as an important reservoir of Cry toxins for production of biological insecticides and insect-resistant genetically modified crops. When insects ingest toxin crystals, their alkaline digestive tracts denature the insoluble crystals, making them soluble and thus amenable to being cut with proteases found in the insect gut, which liberate the toxin from the crystal.[10] The Cry toxin is then inserted into the insect gut cell membrane, paralyzing the digestive tract and forming a pore.[13] The insect stops eating and starves to death; live Bt bacteria may also colonize the insect which can contribute to death.[10][13][14] The midgut bacteria of susceptible larvae may be required for B. thuringiensis insecticidal activity.[15]    That's a lot more brutal than what I authored.   Yes, I'm glad you brought that up because it clarifies my point. It took years for the FDA to realize they needed to pull the lenape potato, at which point people had already been harmed.   It is not your point. You continue to dodge your point and have only succeeded in losing any benefit of the doubt I was wondering if I may have owed you. The solanine was partially bred for, because it imparted a higher blight resistance. It didn't take the FDA years to pull it either. It was yanked immediately after the harvest went into very early production and later they found out why. It's still used today for hybridization, it just doesn't actually become our food.  Your point as you stated it earlier was that hybridization and GMOs are basically the same thing and you are wrong for a fore-stated reasons on that topic."

Yet it is handled by third parties. Why isn't the kosher label government mandated? No good scientific reason, no mandated label.

Instead of having to use 2-3 different kind of pesticide that target each time of weed, and having to use them many times in the years since they are so weak, one pesticide is being used (Roundup in the case of Monsanto). The safety profile of roundup is much better than many other pesticide on the market.   Regarding Organic food, it's not always the case that their cultivation is less damageable to the environnment. For one, they are also allowed to use pesticide, as long that they have not been synthesized in lab. For instance, the use of nicotine is often allowed on organic food, even if it's highly toxic. They are allowed to use Salicylic acid (aspirin) if it was bio-synthesized, even if it's the same damn molecule as when it's chemically synthesized.   My sister is an agronomist and one way farmers cultivate organic apple is by surounding the organic plantation with non-organic ones, and doubling the pesticide dose in those ones.

Now you sound like a Greenpeace rep. GE is unique I that it can enable the poorest people to better feed THEMSELVES. And do so with less water and with tolerance to conditions that cause local food shortages and starvation. Not to mention that GE will enable the world tomfeed the 10 billion soon to be with us without destroying the planet in the process.  You want to ignore an emensley powerful technology because you fail to underdtand it. GE is safe, effective, and neccessarry. It can enable us to respond to rapidly emerging threats to our food supply, wait for it, rapidly. Something traditional breeding cannot do. Traditional breeding would not have saves Hawaii's papayas. GE did. Traditional breeding cannot produce a rice to supply the worlds poorest with vitamin A. GE can.  So far you have presented no arguments against the technology other than the fact you incorrectly think we don't need it. So what else are your concerns. And would you, once again, please read the damn article so I can stop refuting things already thoroughly refuted by it."

Especially when food grown in healthy soil show farm more nutrients.  The UN and WHO have both released reports detailing how local sustainable ag are the only way to feed an ever growing planet. you may think GE tech allows poor people to be given food, but you are mistaken, the royalties, spray fees, and fertilizer cost are all wrapped up in the cost of GE. Additionally you have yet to indicate how commodities markets and global shipping would not continue to make food prohibitively expensive.  You dont know anything about threats to our food supply. You are making hyperbolic claims that do not reflect reality of agriculture, or the scale of chemical pesticide application on conventional crops.

Mandating GMO labels doesn't provide any extra information, it just attempts to scare people away from GMOs.

This is covered at the end of the story. One of the author's salient points is that GMOs can't be all classified as bad (or good). It's really dependent on what the modification is. The GMO papayas are an example where genetic modification was able to reduce pesticide use, however the roundup ready GMOs result in the exact opposite, more pesticide use.

In this case a soy or corn GMO that is planted to cover thousands of acres can be wiped out in one fell swoop.  Planting smaller quantities or staggering strips of land will act as a natural buffer to prevent disease or pestilence from being able to thrive in an environment where there food source is everywhere.    Dr. Fred Perlack offered this as a response in an AMA a week or two ago.  ""Genetic diversity/biodiversity are important concepts in a sustainable agricultural environment. Monsanto markets worldwide over 500 different varieties of hybrid corn on an annual basis. These differ by maturity, disease tolerance, plant architecture, and other attributes, which are valued by the farmers for their specific locale. Farmers have learned long ago, not to plant a single variety across their field. Many farmers will plant there own tests of not only Monsanto's material, but of other seed companies to compare performance. This is a very competitive field with very astute customers. If you are a farmer in Central Illinois you probably have access to 50 or more varieties of corn that could fit your farming operation. They all may have the same biotech trait, but that represents significant diversity""    Is a different variety per monoculture enough to prevent current or future pestilence or disease? I don't have the answer but what I think makes OP and I uncomfortable is if there is enough food source to potentially create a hockey stick growth pattern we can be certain of only one thing, the hockey stick growth cannot last indefinitely.  I think biodiversity can cull this potential."

That being said, I have two diversity concerns. In a general sense GMOs are going to, to some degree, crowd out natural species on non-agricultural land. To be fair, all agriculture does this. But it does introduce an unknown into a vastly complex system.  The more immediate concern is diversity of the food supply. Lets say there's 500 kinds of ""roundup ready"" wheat. They all have a different combo of other traits that make them suited to the environment they were designed for. They are different enough that they don't all get the same blight or are liked by the same insects, and they keep people from starving and it's pretty cool.

I'm happy meat is safe and healthy but I don't feel the need to sneak bacon into my vegan colleagues lunch.   Again, what the hell are you talking about? Who here as advocated putting ""non-GMO"" labels on GMO products?   The correct response to fear mongering is more information, not less. If the case for GMOs, vaccines or 1001 other things is so good, make it publically, don't force it down peoples throats because we know better.

Vote with your wallet - don't try to legislate more shit when there's zero conclusive evidence of health effects.  Soy, wheat, gluten, nuts, shellfish, etc. - yes, please, label those, because they cause allergic reactions which can make susceptible people die. Organic, GMO-free? Pure woo.

As mentioned in the article, there is a ton of disinformation. If a label is likely to scare away people who would otherwise benefit due to  AND at the same time economically damages efforts to improve nutrition and reduce pesticide use, then the label itself is counterfactual to actual information (like those blinded or worse by vitamin deficiency who could have benefited from Golden rice, but did not because of apparently purposeful disinformation.)   Food labeling is typically voluntary and as long as there are people protesting GMOs, you can be sure that some will voluntarily label for a boost in that market. There is your ability to choose. Mandatory labeling may be more harmful, since many consumers don't really understand what that label means."

Why should companies be forced to put labels on their products that, while meaningless, will affect the consumption of their products?  Do you also want labels assuring consumers that no unicorns were harmed in the process of making fruits? Because that kind of label would be about as useful as these GMO labels."

The truth is that ""every dollar you spend is a vote on the sort of world you want to live in"".

Sugar made from GMO beets is identical to sugar made from non-GMO beets. So GMO labeling is the same as other voluntary and non-mandated labels.
TrueReddit,3ddujb,lizzietishthefish,8,Wed Jul 15 18:47:47 2015 UTC,"In my mind it comes down to this: when the government enforces a GMO label, it implies that whether or not something is a GMO has substantial health implications, because otherwise there's no reason the government would have to step in.

It just so transpires that all vodka is gluten-free despite being made from grain (typically), but the subtext is that this vodka is fine but all the competing products contain gluten.  Most people pick up on this sort of subtext immediately and unerringly, but you can't legislate against it because you're not technically lying in the text."

Labeling it as such and continuing to allow the fear of GMOs to propegate contributes to increase use of pesticides on the additional non-GMO crops that will need to be grown. Pesticides are generally way worse, for both the environment and your body, than Roundup and similar products used to keep GMOs pest-free. Since non-GMOs yield less per acre there are issues with using additional water to produce the same amount we previously did, additional oil to drive tractors longer and further. With lower yields per acre and GMO fields being converted to non-GMO fields, costs will also increase, potentially driving costs up in the third world and literally killing people.

Mandatory nutrition labels cost the US economy $2.3 billion, and mandatory GMO labels would probably cost even more. Cost categories include administrative costs, which are the costs of interpreting the rule and deciding on an appropriate action in response to the regulation plus the costs to become and remain certified; costs of testing to determine the GMO content; printing costs, the costs of changing the printing plates or other printing mechanism; inventory costs, the dollar value of the labels in inventory that cannot be used due to the rule; reformulation, changing product recipes; and the sanitization and production line separation to prevent cross-contamination between GMO and non-GMO products. Companies change their labels when there's a marketing advantage to do so. Mandatory GMO labeling is a regulatory burden far above just redrawing a cow on a milk carton, and there is literally no valid reason to do so. ""GMO-Free"" and ""Certified Organic"" labels continue to be allowed, and consumers can also use one of the many apps or websites that identify foods containing GMOs.

They act differently and have a completely different demeanor than the rest of us. It's not just Jews. It is all hook-nosed people.  I was blind to this for most of my life. I think it was because many actors are hook-nosed and play nice people on TV and in movies. I was probably just brainwashed. Considering Hollywood is run by hook-nosed Jews, I am now certain this brainwashing was deliberate on the part of the evil media producers.  But the difference is night and day. If you haven't noticed, try paying attention. Notice the way hook-nosed people turn their backs to you as you pass them on the sidewalk. Notice their rude demeanor. Look at the behavior of hook-nosed people in your lives, versus that of the others.  Yes, Jews are the ultimate example of this. But I think the issue is biological, and not religious. In fact, the non-hook-nosed Jewish people I encountered in Austria were some of the best people I've ever met.  The difference transcends race. Hook-nosed blacks are generally pieces of shit, while blacks with streamlined profiles and upward-turned noses are typically great (although still black).  This rule applies to Indians, Asians, and all other ethnicities. I have found no exceptions. None.  It is almost as if hook-nosed people are a purely evil race. I have also noticed that they are fully aware of their evil nature, and most non hook-nosed people are not. It is as if hook-nosed people are part of a silent conspiracy of evil.

They sit there and scream that all the correlations in the climate record, all the proxy records are all bullshit..but a single solitary event in history correlating to a single solitary event in the sun, all of which MEASURED WITH PROXY DATA.. there was no direct measurement back then and fuck.. measuring sun spots.. in the 1600s. and this shit is the word of god, and all because of sunspots?  You really cant prove anything with an event of 1.  i bet you dude proud of his downvotes thinks the little ice age is the word of god and caused by sun spots.. wont be able to tell you a single scientist involved that even coined the term maunder minimum but he sure as shit will tell you it in fact caused the little ice age.  it was more than a media failing.. you have a known liar lying about a subject they always lie about, making radical claims about that subject that sounds like the exact opposite of what everyone else is claiming..... well you might want to take a second look.  i'd take a second look at shit dailykos claims about republicans.. i demand a source. because despite being left myself i know the publication is biased and i want the truth.

It was your denialists who choose to make climate change the perfered term.  and over night all republicans obeyed, they dropped the term global warming from their lexicon  and thats why climate change won out over AGW... despite in papers its still about 50/50   The phrase ""global warming"" should be abandoned in favour of ""climate change"", Mr Luntz says, and the party should describe its policies as ""conservationist"" instead of ""environmentalist"", because ""most people"" think environmentalists are ""extremists"" who indulge in ""some pretty bizarre behaviour... that turns off many voters"".

He actually addresses this:   Private firms are cherry-picking lucrative services like cataract and hip replacement operations. This will lead to further dismemberment of health service. Instead of surplus money being put back into the system to be spent on patient care, it is siphoned off permanently to boost corporate profits. This means a smaller pot of money to provide comprehensive services at a time when healthcare costs are rising. In other words, CCGs will find themselves between a rock and a hard place, leading to more rationing. Within the first 6 months of the Act, 1 in 7 CCGs had brought in new restrictions over what treatments people can get, according to a survey by the British Medical Journal.

So answer this: Which spends more on its military, Saudi Arabia or Iran?  According to this, the Saudis spend 13 times more on ""defense"" than Iran does.

They are to act as temporary gallows for a public execution...Under the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the number of executions has increased dramatically...Amnesty International says the figures are up from 200 executions in 2006 to about 300 last year, and there have been more than 30 in the first month of this year alone.   Here's a more recent source from this year:   Executions in Iran have soared under president Rouhani, according to an Oslo-based Iranian human rights group, with an average of two now being carried out every day.Among the findings, the groups have found that 753 people were executed in 2014, a 10% increase compared to 2013.  In most cases, public executions are carried out using cranes   You can't be this brain washed, self-deluded, or retarded, surely?  There has to be a limit.  The Iranian government didn't even deny it, they said it was ""necessary"".  Are the Iranian government all a part of Israeli propaganda too?

There are even videos of recent Iranian public stonings.  I'm not going to link to them, but they can be found using google.  You can masturbate to that stuff as you doubtlessly enjoy, but you'll have to search for it yourself.   Iran-Iraq war.  Again, the Iran-Iraq war. It's hugely tragic but it's a fail when you're trying to slander ""the Iranians"" with things that happened 30 years ago in that war.   Has any of it ever been condemned?  Have the Iranian authorities sought to investigate the matter, or apologised for the conduct, which was incredibly widespread and pushed by the government and religious authorities?  Face it, martyrdom is a pivotal part of Shia mentality.  It's a cult obsessed with death.  The culture of suicide attacks is still a part of Iran.   The importance of Martyrdom in Shi’a Islam has brought about the existence of a type of “cult of martyrdom” in Iranian society...Additionally, the themes of martyrdom are evident in children’s textbooks from a very young age, with as much as 10% of the texts depicting themes of death and martyrdom...Often martyrdom meant suicide missions on the battlefield, such as the famous example of the 13-year-old boy Mohammed Hossein Fahmideh who strapped explosives to his body and ran under an Iraqi tank. Such actions were widely publicized and praised as martyrdom.   Source.  So, the suicide attacks by children are still praised as an example of martyrdom in modern Iran.

Between the high production value and socially positive material (alongside scenes of gore and fear) this terrorist organization creates the impression that it is not only a band of extremists living out of caves, but a legitimate ideological alternative to the main stream. I recommend clicking on the link to ""Dabiq"" to see how professional their magazine looks to get a sense of what I'm talking about.

While a receptor for a drug might be on one type of cell and allow the drug to exert effects on that cell type, receptors are also on other cells and therefore the drug stimulates multiple cell types and you get a side effect at that other cell type.  Some types blood pressure medications cause congestion or cough by this mechanism.  Other drugs have side effects because they essentially work too well.  Taking an external drug does not usually allow for the fine control that our body can produce.  For example, low blood glucose levels are a result of taking insulin to reduce blood glucose, blood pressure medications can make people more likely to pass out from low blood pressure when they stand up quickly, and antibiotics are pretty good at killing beneficial bacteria in our guts, vaginas, and other areas.  All of these things lead to side effects.  There are a lot of reasons why drugs cause side effects.  Sometimes it's because of a racemic mixture, but often it's much more complicated and reducing side effects requires developing drugs that are more selective for receptors, better delivery mechanisms, and avoiding taking the drugs unless they are absolutely necessary."
TrueReddit,3d90oi,whatdyasay,9,Tue Jul 14 16:42:52 2015 UTC,Side effects can even vary between formulations and manufacturers depending on the mix of filler that's used.   Edit: Not making it up. For example

The author doesn't mention which maintenance inhaler his wife uses so that someone could fact check the $300 figure he throws out. If it's the Symbicort 160/4.5 that's pictured, that inhaler retails for around $350 BEFORE insurance. The average wholesale price (AWP) is $329.66[1], which means their insurance is doing almost nothing for them. The author concedes that the insurance plan they chose ""wasn’t the most expensive plan,"" but I don't buy it. They probably bought barebones coverage or they have a deductible they haven't met.

I can't think of a good excuse for it other than pure simple greed.  Edit: as many people have rightly pointed out, UK healthcare is not technically free, it comes out of our taxes. However, I think the portion of tax that goes towards the NHS is generally still lower than an average monthly insurance payment in the US, and there are no restrictions (I believe) on the NHS healthcare we have access to.

TrueReddit,3d90oi,chadcf,59,Tue Jul 14 16:50:27 2015 UTC,"This crusade against the word ""free"" bothers me.

""Free"" means, and always meant, what said economists would more narrowly describe as ""free at point of use"". So what you refer as ""single payer universal healthcare"" is in fact ""free healthcare"". To say the opposite is just to repeat the rhetoric and talking points of the anti free healthcare lobby.  Edit: In the end anyone who say it is not free healthcare is using an equivocation between two specific meanings of ""free"":   ""Free"" as in ""free healthcare"" or ""free lunch"", a age old meaning of the word, meaning that people can just walk in and use it, no strings attached, no quid pro quo. ""Free"" as in ""There ain't no such thing as a free lunch"", a meaning that describes literally (and I mean literally) nothing in the whole universe, an abstract concept useful only as a classroom tool in the field of economics."

Medication is cheaper than the US but you still have to pay for it. Some specialists are not covered (psychotherapy, massage therapy, chiropractor, physiotherapy - that kind of stuff). The wait time for non-emergency work and organ donations is long-ish and you can't buy yourself a place ahead in the line easily without going out of the province.   But most of what I mentioned is ""free"" (free in that we pay for it on our taxes, but we pay one third per capita what Americans do for healthcare and live longer, so I'm convinced it is a better deal). With my employer's healthcare package (which costs me about $70 a month, and includes life insurance as well as the optional ortho/dentures package), I pay $5.88 for almost every prescription (I have found one exception, and I take a pretty new medication) and get a lot of the other things covered.

TrueReddit,3d90oi,StabbyPants,37,Tue Jul 14 21:13:56 2015 UTC,"I can't think of a good excuse for it other than pure simple greed.   This may help explain it.  Assume the absence of Universal healthcare that Europe and others enjoy and pay for through high taxation.  When you are not a medium or heavy consumer of healthcare, it is insanely cheap to you, the individual.    Not quite 20 years ago, I grew up, moved out on my own and  started having to pay for my own healthcare.  My employer sponsored plan for a young, single, non-smoker, male was only $16 per month subtracted from my take home pay (after taxes).  I don't know how good or bad the insurance was, I can count on two hands how many times I had to go to a doctor in those first 10 years.  All the time I was paying $16/month my female co-workers were paying close to $100/month.  The insurance justification was childbirth costs, again, I didn't see it reflected in mine.  Laws were changed some years ago equalizing this.  Also, rates in general rose over time.  At the time of equalization, I was paying about $110/month and so were my female coworkers finally.  Even now, that is a very small chunk of money as healthcare has improved in what is offered and what is covered.  This savings to me, individually, represents hundreds and thousands of dollars I have been able to improve my life, education, and lifestyle.  I've never had any serious injury, never been hospitalized, and don't take any regular prescription medications.  My experience is what most people think they will have.  This is why they still champion our private healthcare model. Unfortunately, that isn't reality.  I know I have been extremely lucky so far, and most people aren't.  A single surgery in the past would have wiped me out financially for decades.  A reoccurring illness would have bankrupted me on trying to buy prescription medication.  The regular treatment of a physiological disorder would have stolen my future from me.  I got so lucky, and I know it.    I am an advocate for universal care.  I understand that even though I have been lucky, most of us aren't.  We grow strong with the strength of our community and that means everyone needs to have access to affordable healthcare.  I'm quite fine if that means my take home pay shrinks noticeably to pay for it.  All of us will be better for it."

I didn't realise that - thought it was just the greed of the drug companies and hospitals, etc.  It's so bizarre to me though, the concept of having to think about whether or not to have an operation (for example) based on financial concerns. God knows our NHS is far from perfect, but at least I'll never be turned away from potentially life-saving healthcare because I can't afford it."
TrueReddit,3d90oi,JangoF76,8,Tue Jul 14 16:11:49 2015 UTC,"Greed and rent seeking does have something to do with it, it's just not the only thing. Take for example that health insurance is mostly regulated by the states so you have fifty different sets of rules and it makes it easier for companies to have influence and harder to have national policy. Then you have the battle against  'Cadillac' insurance plans which covers some unions health plans, unions who have made wage concessions to have these premium health plans. And that's just two aspects of the system. The whole system it so complex that the inertia mean that it is hard to change anything."

You're right, though, that it isn't a huge majority, and it wasn't always this way. As recently as 2007, approx. 69% of Americans believed that the government was responsible for ensuring that its citizens had healthcare coverage: http://www.gallup.com/poll/4708/healthcare-system.aspx. Basically, the idea of universal healthcare was pretty popular in America right up until Obama ran on a platform of universal healthcare. At that point, the Republican base reversed course since if Obama supported it it must be evil, even if they agreed with him earlier that year. Hell, the structure of Obamacare originally came from Republicans, as an alternative to single-payer healthcare when Hillary was pushing for it back in the early-mid 90s.   As with all things in this country, once the issue became political it became divisive, because a bunch of people can't agree with common sense if the 'other team' is backing it.

Every major healthcare legislation concocted by congress and the states over the past 60 years has purposely been crafted to maximize healthcare costs in the country (banning HMO cost controls in the 90s, banning drug reimportation, banning Medicare drug price negotiation, banning price consideration in Medicare reimbursement decisions, >$50B in Medicare fraud per year, crazy fee for service pricing, creating and ossifying the employee based healthcare system, mandating all sorts of services in insurance programs, etc.).

Also, this article is about someone who signed up for health care under the ACA (""Obamacare"") and got confused by the details and made a bad decision on coverage.

Our country is a mess and if it doesn't get straightened out through the political system soon you're going to see more rioting. There will either be legitimate change from the system or there will be forced change similar to the civil rights movement where citizens demand human rights, like being able to go to a fucking doctor and take time off when you get sick and have a vacation once in a while.  All that being said, I do agree with conservatives on one major point, the US subsidizes half the worlds military and the tax burden that comes with this is ridiculous. We spend a tremendous, ridiculous, amount on defense spending and part of the reason is because other countries can't or won't spend significant amounts on their own military. A portion of US military spending is waste (building tanks no one wants that we don't use and can't sell because some senator protects the program because it provides a thousand jobs in his district) and those things definitely need to be addressed, but we also spend a lot on shit like keeping aircraft carriers constantly on station, maintaining foreign military bases, and supplying discounted arms to other countries and we do that because if we didn't the world would be a much less stable place."

As it is now, the US basically subsidizes drug prices for most other places in the world. We pay such high prices because many other countries won't let them charge very much, so to recoup R&D costs someone has to pay more. And it's us!   If suddenly drug companies were no longer allowed to charge as much for drugs in the US, I think there's a chance it would mean either less drug development or rising prices for the rest of the world.

The cash price of this drug is around 300 (It's a bit less in my region, but symbicort is still several hundred dollars a month cheaper than advair).   The issue is probably that their insurance deductible didn't kick in, or that symbicort was not a covered drug and they should have used advair or dulera."

Curious if anything has actually happened to anyone in a situation like this. If you need a prescription for it, then it is a controlled substance, but AFAIK you are only charged for possession etc. if it you have a scheduled substance like amphetamine. Is the buyer actually at any legal risk for controlled, non-scheduled substances, or it the seller the only one liable (i.e. selling without a pharmaceutical license or w/e)?   the process of setting up and using the nebulizer takes around 15 minutes and the machine itself is incredibly loud.   Have a nebulizer, but only use it for vaping ethanol. It takes all of 2 minutes to assemble and plug in, and the mixing chamber for where you'd put in your medicine is super easy to measure out. Can anyone elaborate on why she has such an intense-sounding nebulizer, when she can usually use the maintenance inhaler just a few times per day?  Also, this wasn't the main topic, but it stuck out to me, nonetheless   These markets have gained a pretty nasty reputation because of the items they sell. Ross Ulbricht, the man who ran the Silk Road dark net market, just received a sentence of more than two lifetimes in prison; before his sentencing, family members of people who died from overdosing on drugs bought on Silk Road wrote letters to the judge asking for justice.

The first thought that came to my mind was that they just got a new plan. Many plans have deductibles that have to be paid before coverage kicks in which means she would have to pay the full price on those drugs until a certain amount was paid. That $300 price tag was probably the full price, although that seems just a bit too high for most of the maintenance inhalers on the market, if my memory serves me correctly (assuming a 30 day supply).   It has always struck me as irresponsible when people don't know these things about plans that they pick. Why would you enter into a plan without first checking on the coverage of the drugs you need?  Edit: for everyone replying that it is hard please check out the information from one of Kentucky's health exchange providers. https://mykyhc.org/Individual-Families/Pages/default.aspx  I looked at the silver and gold options. The information is simple, cleanly and clearly laid out. The only thing she would be required to do is call and find out of the drugs she was on were covered. This is a case of a deductible that she had to pay first. She didn't look up this info first (which is presented when you sign up) nor did she read the info that was mailed after she joined (which probably came with her insurance card)."

For someone as well versed as me in health insurance, sometimes the health insurance companies literally do not have the information or it can change while you are stuck in the plan.  In the last two years, in October I called the insurance company and said ""Are these doctors going to be in network?"" and ""Are these hospitals going to be in network?"" and the answers are ""We don't know."" Call the hospital, they say ""We're in negotiations."" This year one health insurer didn't get to an agreement with the hospital until near March. They often all don't reach agreements until after the calendar/deductible year has started. The other insurer that had the agreement with the hospital at the beginning of the year, they have a history of ending their contract in the middle of the year and removing it from the network for multiple months during renegotiation. How are you supposed to pick a plan with information like this?  You can't change plans and maybe you are already a good way through your deductible and perhaps you've even met your max out of pocket. Similarly, the formulary changes all the time, including in the middle of the year. Contracts get renegotiated and the $10 generic you are looking at can end up being $50 a month later."

We used to be able to excuse our imperialism based on an invented threat that the USSR was going to take over the world. But since the breakup of the USSR what's our excuse now? Again, why aren't we allowing the UN to do the job that we invented the UN to do? (We know the reason, because we're a rogue state and the UN won't do exactly what we tell it to do.)  Of course, that would mean the US government would have to stop seeking ""full spectrum dominance"", start treating other large powers as equals, and to stop trying to take over the world. That would be a big change. But the upside would be a more peaceful world and stopping the impoverishment of the American people from the debts of all of our insane wars.   ""Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial establishment would have to go on, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."" -- US ambassador to the USSR and State Dept. strategist George F. Kennan."

I tend to agree with your sentiments, but the USSR wasn't even subtle about their moves in that regard.  Maybe they never had a chance to take over the whole world and maybe they didn't, but they did a stellar job of turning ""influence"" in a given country into ""control"" and the reach into Cuba and central america was plenty to combine with the communist manifesto and the actual actions of the USSR to make me question the use of ""invented"" here.  Oh, I don't disagree that the reaction that followed was a shitstorm of salivating greed as the US screwed up one country after the next to fight the spread of communism, but at the same time I think it's important to acknowledge that there actually was a threat involved.  At a minimum it was a direct threat to close allies and certainly came close enough to the US for me to have been concerned about it on the home continent."

Your quote at the end suggests to me that you hold some strong opinions about the US military.

""Militaristic Propoganda"" seems a bit strong, no?   No, I don't think so. In an age where we routinely attack other countries and our military commits the most heinous war crimes with impunity, it takes many forms of nationalism and propaganda to whitewash the morals from people's minds to allow them to passively accept nullifying our civil liberties and the military's role.

TrueReddit,3dbn78,howstrangeinnocence,5,Wed Jul 15 00:39:16 2015 UTC,"The question that ethics is attempting to answer may be ""can we act better?""    ‘The kids who always talk about being fair and sharing,’ I recall him saying, ‘mostly just want you to be fair to them and share with them.’   So, it seems that for both the ethics professors and children ultimately their actions are a kind of selfish reciprocity. It is a relative decadence compared to the high minded ideals of the ancient (ascetic?) philosophers. Like the author feels, it could be that those old idols were just as false as ones who claim to be so today. Maybe it is more authentic to be like Jefferson once you know that there might be a better way. To know that we can act better but to roll around in the muck happier than a pig in shit anyway.  Ultimately to be in the former or latter state you have to be of the mind that you've answered the question and have a satisfactory answer. If you've got the answer, the logical consequent is to do. But modern philosophy looks caught up in a feedback loop of meta-analysis. That's where I think this problem is truly rooted. Maybe this is because it really is the case that the old ethical wisdom holds a sense of truth about human beings: ""Do not do to others that which angers you when they do it to you."" The answer has been there for thousands of years but our lives are too short and we like pleasure too much to bother actually doing. So we run in circles trying to find an easier alternative.  I'm reminded of this biblical section:    I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. And I set my heart to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been done under heaven. It is an evil grievous task which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with. I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun, and behold, all is futile vanity and striving after wind. What is crooked cannot be straightened and what is lacking cannot be counted.  I spoke with my heart, saying “Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who were over Jerusalem before me; and my heart has observed an abundance in wealth of wisdom and knowledge.” And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind. Because in much wisdom there is much grief, and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain.   On the greeks, I'm also reminded of another phrase:    It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and honorably and justly, and it is impossible to live wisely and honorably and justly without living pleasantly. Whenever any one of these is lacking, when, for instance, the man is not able to live wisely, though he lives honorably and justly, it is impossible for him to live a pleasant life.   Which is to say, knowledge of what is ethical is useless if one does not practice it. And more, if one doesn't practice it, it probably isn't knowledge at all."
TrueReddit,3dbn78,antihexe,3,Wed Jul 15 06:41:13 2015 UTC,"Modern and ancient philosophers have different goals. Ancient philosophers wanted to essentially be leaders, which required them to actually live the kind of lives they preached - if they didn't do that, no one would follow them and their reflections on ethics were forgotten.  Modern philosophers want to publish, gain academic status, get professorships. Their main duty is to create abstract ideas, not actually live their philosophies."

For example, are actions inherently good or bad, or is it just their consequences that matter?  This is the kind of thing ethicists ask.  The author's premise is a little like saying, if a sports writer isn't better at sports than a typical person, then he's a hypocrite.  It makes no sense.

TrueReddit,3deqhi,mrnovember5,2,Wed Jul 15 20:47:19 2015 UTC,"The author is plainly overlooking the point of art for most people. Art-afficionados might appreciate the technique, or the symbolism, or the particular set of circumstances that led the artist to create this particular piece. The average person appreciates art at an aesthetic level only. For you to say ""Well, what about oil painting?"" implies that oil painting should be promoted because it's ""better"" in some way, even though the primary audience wouldn't appreciate it at all, hence why they gravitate to Ai Weiwei.  But that's irrelevant to the issue at hand. ""The crowd"" didn't select Ai Weiwei, the Royal Academy selected Ai Weiwei, and then attempted to use interest in the artist to pre-fund the exhibition. This is not any different than selling tickets to a gala event in order to finance bringing in the piece that the gala is ostensibly held for.  The author pre-supposes that there is an inherent value to art aside from the enjoyment of consuming it. That there is some inherent value in art, even if it doesn't appeal to anyone. That art isn't expected to please people, or that pleasing art is somehow more base than art that adheres to ""principles"" in some fashion.   The danger of crowdfunding is blindingly apparent. It subjects artistic endeavour to the whim of many people.    No, it doesn't. Artistic endeavour is undertaken to satisfy the artist and his/her need to express themselves. Nobody is telling you that you can't paint oil paintings because they're not as popular as photography. But you don't need a pedestal to stand on just because you have expressed yourself, and there's no reason to believe that you should get that pedestal if a reasonable population doesn't appreciate your work.  Anyone is free to be artistic, but people who want to have their expressions displayed at the Royal Academy should probably consider if people who visit the Royal Academy want to see their expression, and if not, find a different expression that suits that goal."

TrueReddit,3d93u7,twixonurface,33,Tue Jul 14 13:41:44 2015 UTC,"What's amazing to me about the general conservative stance on Iran is the insane lack of maturity.  The conservative side is consumed by the idea that Iran getting nuclear weapons -- a supposition in and of itself -- will be the end of the world.  There's no recognition that Iran is a self-interested actor, and it is assumed that they are not rational, despite a cursory survey of the country's recent (100 years) history and a basic examination of Iran's actions since 1979.  There is also the charge that Iran obtaining nuclear weapons will lead to an arms race, as if somehow Israel having them has not, in fact, historically caused the same in Libya, Syria, and Iraq.  Then there's the whole insane trampling of sovereignty -- the conservatives want international (read: U.S.) inspectors to have access to ALL Iranian military sites -- who in their right mind thinks any government anywhere ever would accede to such a ridiculous demand?  The last part is the whole attitude towards Iran, especially with regards to diplomacy.  They conveniently ignore tyranny in places like Saudi Arabia, citing oil, as if Iran hasn't got any, while screaming about the Ayatollahs and people saying ""Death to Israel/Death to America"".  They seem to think that freezing Iran out totally will produce superior outcomes to actual diplomacy.  Someone once wrote that the ultimate beauty of democratic capitalism is that it is easier to seduce with it than to bludgeon, and it's remarkable that conservatives who have a fetish for the idea of the American Dream don't see that."

Even if we assume that because Iran is a self-interested actor, they will not launch an offensive nuclear strike (because it will lead to their own demise), there are still reasons to be worried. It is no secret that Iran funds paramilitary Shia groups that are participating in the proxy war raging all over the Middle East. One major concern of a nuclear-armed Iran would be the uptick in nuclear weapons floating around the outskirts of a major war-zone. Using a weapon of this magnitude almost certainly would illicit a major backlash against the entity deemed responsible. It would seem possible to me that using these weapons would be a great way to crush your enemy (by framing them as the perpetrators, or by someone with access seeking to displace the current regime in Iran, etc.).   I don't believe the end of the world would follow from a nuclear-armed Iran, though I do think our chances of a catastrophe are non-trivially worsened. It is in humanity's interest to keep such powerful weapons out of this region for as long as possible.   What I am driving at is that I believe the neo-cons are right when they fear a nuclear-armed Iran. However, I am not sure they are right (in their rhetoric anyway) in how they would prevent this from occurring. You are on point when you say ""freezing out"" Iran is a horrible idea, but I think you are downplaying the dangers of Iran gaining these powers."
TrueReddit,3d93u7,voiceinthewildernes,16,Tue Jul 14 15:57:14 2015 UTC,"I think that their funding of paramilitaries is a symptom of the disease though -- they cannot militarily engage Israel / Turkey / Saudi Arabia / USA, but the actions of those other parties mean they can't sit still either.  It's true the proximity to warzones is troubling, but I think Pakistan is even less stable than Iran, and we're not exactly pursuing disarmament with them.  In terms of access to said weapons, I doubt if anyone with even a modicum of dissent in their pedigree would be let within miles of a nuclear weapon -- the staff, from the generals that oversee their weapons program (assuming that's what it is), down to the civilians that deliver pizza, will be hardliners.  In this instance, it seems it's actually a boon for Iran to have them in the first place.  One thing I take issue with in your argument, which is part and parcel with the first point above in my reply, is that nuclear weapons are already in the region.    Iran is basically pinned in place by a regime that has nuclear weapons, has demonstrated a willingness to launch pre-emptive strikes, and has issue with Iran for no good reason.  You know that stuff about Ruhollah Khomeini saying ""Israel must be wiped off the map""?  The thing that every Iranian politician ever has said since then?  Well, it turns out that sentence is somewhat contentious.  If you were assailed by the regime that insists on parroting that, and their sole-superpower backers, would you sit pretty, or maybe make use of domestic upheaval in Lebanon and Syria (and much later Iraq) to peddle influence?  At present those militias are a problem, but only because Iran has been left with no other option to pursue its interests in those arenas.    Remember that while the US and Russia might have significant interest in stability in the region, they have fundamentally different ideas about what that looks like and how to achieve it, and this is all next door to Iran.  They're playing big-power politics with a regional-power toolkit, and they have nowhere else to go, because retreat from the situation will worsen the outcomes for Iran.  Let's remember that this whole mess started with the US invading Iraq in 2003.  That was the first acute step on the road to this mess.  US invades, topples Saddam with only 150,000 troops to ensure order in a country of 36,000,000?  And disbands the military and says that any Baathists are now legally, politically, and socially persona non grata, leaving no prospects for 2,000,000 men with military training and easy access to weapons?  And when the sectarian militias started slaughtering one another, the US was singularly ineffective at stopping sectarian cleansing and segregation.    Would you trust the US to make good decisions in Syria and Iraq the second time around, or would you throw your weight in and try to claw out some less-bad outcomes?"

Pakistan won't give up weapons as long as India has them. That's why the US is pumping millions into the country to maintain influence and some semblance of stability.   Iran is basically pinned in place by a regime that has nuclear weapons, has demonstrated a willingness to launch pre-emptive strikes, and has issue with Iran for no good reason.   Other than Iran funding/training/arming terrorist organizations that target Israel/Israelis/Jews while calling the country a cancer/tumor and talking about how it will be destroyed.   The thing that every Iranian politician ever has said since then? Well, it turns out that sentence is somewhat contentious   If you read /r/conspiracy level garbage like the kind of stuff you find on globalresearch.ca it might be. From The Official Site of the President of The Islamic Republic of Iran   President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said here Monday that the Zionist Regime of Israel faces a deadend and will under God's grace be wiped off the map.  ""O dear Imam (Khomeini)! You said the Zionist Regime that is a usurper and illegitimate regime and a cancerous tumor should be wiped off the map. I should say that your illuminating remark and cause is going to come true today. The Zionist Regime has lost its existence philosophy... the Zionist regime faces a complete deadend and under God's grace your wish will soon be materialized and the corrupt element will be wiped off the map,"" said President Ahmadinejad.   That seems pretty clear to me."

But behind his drive for an Iranian nuclear deal is the effort to make American foreign policy “solvent” again by bringing America’s ends into alignment with its means. That means recognizing that the United States cannot bludgeon Iran into total submission, either economically or militarily. The U.S. tried that in Iraq.  It is precisely this recognition that makes the Iran deal so infuriating to Obama’s critics. It codifies the limits of American power. And recognizing the limits of American power also means recognizing the limits of American exceptionalism. It means recognizing that no matter how deeply Americans believe in their country’s unique virtue, the United States is subject to the same restraints that have governed great powers in the past. For the Republican right, that’s a deeply unwelcome realization. For many other Americans, it’s a relief. It’s a sign that, finally, the Bush era in American foreign policy is over.

Sometimes a small pack that you can scoot with is best, sometimes a larger quantity of things that you have time to load into a car if you still have roads...keep in mind that some offroad capability in your vehicle can be a life-saver.  If you're running pure street tires it's a waste and most AWD crossovers etc aren't worth a damn, so if you're actually concerned about it a light truck with some ground clearance and big stupid tires that can be made fun of is actually terribly useful."

TrueReddit,3d56s0,djak,157,Mon Jul 13 16:52:28 2015 UTC,"If you divide ten thousand by forty-one, you get two hundred and forty-three, which is Cascadia’s recurrence interval: the average amount of time that elapses between earthquakes. That timespan is dangerous both because it is too long—long enough for us to unwittingly build an entire civilization on top of our continent’s worst fault line—and because it is not long enough. Counting from the earthquake of 1700, we are now three hundred and fifteen years into a two-hundred-and-forty-three-year cycle.   and an audible ""oh fuck"" was heard throughout my neighbourhood"
TrueReddit,3d56s0,ryannayr140,49,Tue Jul 14 08:04:16 2015 UTC,"I did some searches and found that there have been intervals between 300-900 years between Cascadian earthquakes.

I would hope that the military bases and housing are  stricter on their standards, given the need for military personnel after a natural disaster of this magnitude, but hey....we are talking about the U.S. gubment here."

TrueReddit,3d56s0,scottfarrar,22,Mon Jul 13 21:15:19 2015 UTC,I think that's going to depend on how many are still on the ground when the quake strikes.
TrueReddit,3d56s0,jhobag,46,Mon Jul 13 21:56:56 2015 UTC,"I'm always a little annoyed at the talk about the average on recurrence levels.  At least this time the article's next paragraph actually talks about this:   It is possible to quibble with that number. Recurrence intervals are averages, and averages are tricky: ten is the average of nine and eleven, but also of eighteen and two. It is not possible, however, to dispute the scale of the problem.    But to go further, 9 is also the average of {1, 5, 2, 28}.  The true distribution is probably not as complicated as that, but it is also probably not as simple as 9, 9, 9, 9...  That doesn't take away from the need to be prepared, but the simple average of earthquakes holds very little predictive power and while we are learning more about earthquake patterns I'm not sure if we can claim ""overdue""."
TrueReddit,3d56s0,scottfarrar,11,Mon Jul 13 22:32:05 2015 UTC,how much is the estimated interval off by? a couple decades? irrelevant because the catastrophe will occur and little is being done to reduce its impact
TrueReddit,3d56s0,YoungsterJoey99,29,Mon Jul 13 23:02:09 2015 UTC,"According to wikipedia's list of ""great earthquakes"" for the region: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_subduction_zone the intervals have been (in years): 780, 210, 330, 910, 400, 250.  The average is 480, thus the residuals (how much each interval is off by) is: 300, -270, -150, 430, -80, -230.  So the interval is off by decades or centuries.  Using a different list of intervals found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1700_Cascadia_earthquake we see intervals: 315, 390, 500, 410, 570, 530 years: average 435.  Residuals are then -165, -90, 20, -70, 90, -50.  So the interval is off by decades.  But you are right that when a great earthquake hits Cascadia it will be catastrophic if we are unprepared. I mainly want to make sure we aren't satisfied with simplistic and inaccurate prediction models. I think the New Yorker's writers and readers are educated enough to process a little more statistical information."
TrueReddit,3d56s0,Redpaw_Designs2,4,Tue Jul 14 00:39:10 2015 UTC,"But you need to also remember that anti-earthquake and anti-tsunami measures, at least ones that make a significant difference, can takes decades to be put into place, possibly upwards of a century, seeing how ignorant a lot of the north west coastal governments seem to be.  So to put it in perspective, sure the earthquake most likely won't happen for another 100+ years but also in those 100+ not much will be done and the coastal regions will still most likely have the lack of preparation that they have today"

Then let's have some more optimism and say 1 person per every two collapsing buildings dies. That's 25'000, double their estimation, from the quake alone. That doesn't even account for the Tsunami, you know, the thing that actually killed the 18'000 people in Japan. Japan's or Washington's overall density isn't really that important - what's important is the density of potentially affected areas close to the coast. I don't have any numbers for coast towns and villages, but at least looking at the bigger cities in the area, Portland has a 50% higher density than Sendai, Seattle is even twice as dense.

There's a lot of debate about how the Sound would be effected by a tsunami. A 100' wave slamming into the coast obviously isn't just going to smash right over the Olympic peninsula and crash into Seattle. It will have to go through the straight, then the Salish sea, turn south between Port Townsend and Whidbey Island, around the Kitsap Peninsula where some energy should be funneled into the Hood Canal, and then down to Seattle. That's a lot of distance to lose energy over and a lot of coast line to provide resistance.  There isn't enough water in Puget Sound to cause a tsunami the way we imagine them hitting the coast. There's just not enough mass and room to build up energy. But there's not a solid consensus as to how serious a coastal tsunami would affect the mid and lower Puget Sound areas because nothing on that scale has really been observed. Every article I've read about relevant computer modeling has turned up inconclusive.  No doubt there would be some affect. I imagine some ripping currents and some very low and high tides from the flux in coastal sea levels but the real tsunami devastation this far in from the actual coast is still a bit of a best guess."

I went looking for inundation maps for Puget Sound right after the Tohoku quake... there's just nothing out there for a Cascadia event.  But, though the article didn't talk about it, Seattle has its own potential nightmare with the Seattle Fault, which could create a seiche (technically different than a tsunami, but still causes massive flooding) in Puget Sound and local lakes that would swamp low-lying parts of town. The ultra-bad news attached to that is that the water could be coming in before the shaking even stops, so no chance to evacuate.  There is speculation that a Cascadia event could also trigger seiches quite far inland also, but again, almost no good models to project the severity."

Actually, I'll give an example:   http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/fatal-distraction-forgetting-a-child-in-thebackseat-of-a-car-is-a-horrifying-mistake-is-it-a-crime/2014/06/16/8ae0fe3a-f580-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html  You could never forget your baby in a car all day, would you? What if you would never have that problem because your kid is noisy and chatty? Don't be so sure.    British psychologist James Reason coined the term the “Swiss Cheese Model” in 1990 to explain through analogy why catastrophic failures can occur in organizations despite multiple layers of defense. Reason likens the layers to slices of Swiss cheese, piled upon each other, five or six deep. The holes represent small, potentially insignificant weaknesses. Things will totally collapse only rarely, he says, but when they do, it is by coincidence -- when all the holes happen to align so that there is a breach through the entire system.   A number of things happened for this woman to forget her child. She had been up late at night. Her noisy kid was sick and uncharacteristically quiet. He was in a different position in the car, in a different car seat than before, unseen. She was driving a different car, so different habits. Diaper bag reminder was in a different place. Babysitter got a new phone and only one number for mom. And Mom got a phone call near the end of her drive and was distracted when getting out of the car.  Any Single One of these totally insignificant errors could have prevented a tragedy. But since they all lined up, the unthinkable happened. :-( I imagine the jetliner analogy runs on similar lines.   I read somewhere the the Japanese nuclear plant failures were actually impressive that more of them didn't fail. But the plan is, there are disaster plans and then there are backup plans and then there are backup plans for the backup plans. So for the Fukushima failures, six or eight plans in a row had to fail for their disaster."

TrueReddit,3d56s0,zirzo,79,Mon Jul 13 18:26:01 2015 UTC,"Well, for the Pacific Northwest the spring has already been loaded, in a sense. The whole North American continent is compressed like a spring and ready to pop loose. So there's no way to gradually uncompress that.  But more generally, fracking induces very small earthquakes, around magnitude 3 (if it causes them at all!) That's quite literally a million times less powerful than a magnitude 9 earthquake. With fracking, sometimes small faults shift a little bit in response to the injected fluids. But I don't see any way fluid injection could possibly affect a subduction zone that stretches over hundreds of miles.   A magnitude 3 earthquake is to a magnitude 9 earthquake like 0.1 lbs of pebbles are to your entire 100,000 pound house. You can move around some small pebbles by blowing on them, but you're not going to move your house that way."

A tiny human injection well isn't going much of anything to relieve that pressure."
TrueReddit,3d56s0,5np,11,Mon Jul 13 18:31:54 2015 UTC,"For avalanche mitigation, humans have set off controlled avalanches with TNT. The actual energy dissipation is much larger than the input TNT because the TNT merely acts as a catalyst.  No idea if this is applicable for earthquakes, but perhaps tiny human injections at precise locations can set off smaller quakes to relieve some pressure. A hundred 6.0 quakes (if we can get that precise) is probably preferable to one 8.0 quake."
TrueReddit,3d56s0,mmmkunz,16,Mon Jul 13 18:39:30 2015 UTC,"But that's not quite how it works. The truth is we understand what causes earthquakes poorly, but we think small earthquakes can be triggered by weakening existing faults after fluid injections.   But an earthquake of that magnitude is caused when a massive fault finally gives way and miles of rock are sheared off, allowing an entire continent to slide past. Imagine your continent is like a stuck gear that finally comes loose when the little plastic teeth break - but in this case, the ""teeth"" making it stick is miles of underground rock. We know so little about faults, as they're often buried beneath miles of rock and even getting a tiny window into them costs millions (i.e., drilling a well). I doubt we could find the precise range where the continent is ""stuck"" and weaken that.   I studied geophysics in college but not this particular topic, so I'm kind of shooting from the hip. But just knowing the incredible magnitude of the forces at play and the vast amounts of uncertainty, it seems more like science fiction to me. It's possible to weaken small faults. I doubt it's possible to weaken a really unimaginably huge subduction zone.   But, as /u/buzzkill_aldrin (very appropriate username) pointed out, setting off a massive earthquake would never be politically feasible. People are stupid, especially when both science, lives, and property are involved. If you set off an earthquake that destroyed the Pacific Northwest, even if it saved lives and money in the end, a considerable segment of the population would think you were worse than Hilter. A natural catastrophe of the highest order is probably more politically feasible than controlled demolition that would be a million times better, statistically speaking, and just take just a handful of lives. People don't get numbers, but they sure are good at assigning blame to people."

Maybe, but I don't think so.  Different mechanisms.   Earthquakes are just vibrations in the earth caused by movement deep underground.  Think like the water rippling in jurassic park. Giant earthquakes like the one discussed in the article are caused by hundreds of miles of land slipping at once.   The frackign earthquakes are relatively small, and are caused, in part, but us breaking up large chunks of subterranean rock to extract oil. It removes support from above, and laterally if there's pressure, so you get lots of small earthquakes as the oil formations collapse and shift."

After a massive quake there will be no power, no water and, very shortly, very little food- especially in a place like the PNW and Seattle specifically, where almost every calorie eaten has travelled to the city via multiple bridges and elevated highways.  It will not be possible for FEMA to airlift enough food to feed the city, so we'll be on our own for weeks or months.  $200 worth of beans, oil, rice and sugar at Costco could make a very big difference.

And those 10 billion will be striving to live American-large sucking down far more resources as they become more affluent, a process which will take many generations if not 100s of years in places.  Also in Sub-Sahara Africa, people are still above replacement rate even when affluent. The affluent=low birth doesn't hold true everywhere.

Pao never stood a chance here, and she wasn't around long enough to really see if she'd have been any good at the job. With the vast amount of hatred towards non-whites, feminists, and women mixed with a general disdain for authority, topped with a guy like Alexis shoving her under the bus and holding her there while it backed up again pretty much guaranteed she'd fail. There really isn't anything she could have done that wouldn't have been attacked by a loud faction of hateful people. Banning a subreddit dedicated to hate just motivated them even more.  The drama filled turn over and power of unpaid volunteers to shut down the most popular parts of the site are going to hamper recruiting. What are we on, CEO 3 of the last 12 months?

TrueReddit,3d9or8,TheCodexx,4,Wed Jul 15 19:19:03 2015 UTC,"Text:   REDDIT is either a robust bastion of American-style free speech, pushing the envelope in all directions in the interest of exploring difficult ideas, or it is a bottomless cesspool, depending on whom one asks. It could be a bit of both. But unless changes are made, the latter could suck the former into its murky depths.  Ellen Pao, its boss, resigned on July 10th under what has been described as mutual agreement. She said that she disagreed with the board’s vision, which called for faster growth than she thouht was realistic. But it would have been hard to miss that she had become an object of hatred for many of Reddit’s users. They had been clamouring for her resignation since July 2nd, when she sacked Victoria Taylor, who had headed its extremely popular Ask Me Anything (/r/iAMA) interview section. Some of them exploded in a mixture of sexist and racist jubilation when her dismissal was announced.  Reddit calls itself the internet’s front page. It is better understood as the successor to Usenet, a clutch of discussion groups born of an earlier internet, when the network was mostly used by academics. It also resembles a collage pasted to the door of a student’s dorm room—a reflection of its demographics. Like Usenet before it, Reddit is very young and male. A survey conducted in 2013 by the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank, found that whereas 6% of all American internet users had visited Reddit, 15% of all men aged 18 to 29 used it. They were joined by only 5% of women their age, and by 8% of men aged 30 to 49. By contrast, a Pew study found that 71% of all Americans online visited facebook in 2014; 42% of American women frequent Pinterest.  Reddit’s fundamental problem is its reliance on unpaid labour, a difficulty shared with other community-run sites like Wikipedia. But for Reddit, this is complicated by its for-profit status. Reddit has roughly 70 paid staff, who handle the site's infrastructure. An estimated 20,000 volunteer moderators help manage over 9,000 active boards, which play host to 164m unique users a month, by the firm's most recent count. The subreddits are created around topics of intense interest, whether for good or ill. Reddit has long relied on users' ability to “upvote” and “downvote” given posts to help police the site, but the wisdom of crowds does not always keep objectionable content buried. Moderators have generally helped to keep the site functioning. A plan to distribute $5m in shares to these “redditors” at its October valuation has yet to be firmed up.  Since Ms Pao’s departure, both of Reddit’s founders have returned to manage the firm. They regard the site as a self-governing sucessor to Usenet and its tradition of (nearly) unfettered speech. The firm is majority-owned by Advance Publications, which also owns Condé Nast, a giant media group. It attracted $50m in new investment last October from top-tier Silicon Valley venture capitalists and celebrities such as Jared Leto, a singer, and Snoop Dogg, a rapper.  After Ms Taylor left, ad hoc protests by angry moderators took sections of Reddit down for days. Many of the moderators had supported her, and many others said they were protesting a general lack of communication from the company. They would have appreciated advance notice of her dismissal, they suggested, and also better tools to do their ""jobs"". Redditors have long sought site-based controls to help them block persistent “trolls” (who register an endless series of disposable accounts to post abuse and nonsense). They also complain of the inordinate time it takes to shut down “raids”, in which the participants of one subreddit bombard another—usually due to some perceived slight, to make an ideological point or just for the “lulz”—that is, malicious glee at the discomfort of others.  Beyond the valley of the dudes For years, Reddit allowed a board that hosted images that strayed close to the legal definition of child pornography, which was only closed in 2011. A quasi-successor focused on non-consensually posted images of women, /r/Creepshots, was banned in late 2012 after an exposé by Gawker, a magazine, of violentacrez, a popular redditor involved in both boards. Other offensive boards were removed in subsequent years, all for “behaviour, not ideas”, as Ms Pao stated recently. They had engaged in the manipulation of Reddit; harassment of individuals outside of the boards; or, in the case of /r/TheFappening, the posting of stolen nude images of celebrities. One of Ms Pao’s last moves, on June 10th, was to revise the definition of appropriate behaviour and effectively ban several more boards, including /r/fatpeoplehate.  Thus Reddit’s great contradictions: it is a for-profit operation with investors to satisfy, but which relies on volunteers’ giving their time free of charge. Reddit would no doubt prefer to leave the contradiction unresolved, and to accept hate speech as the unavoidable cost to being a haven for free expression. But investors, and the great mass of typical users, may demand something different."

I am sure it is ricocheting around Europe today. One of the more explosive things I've read in a while...  Here's another equally stunning 30 min interview he gave to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation today: http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/2015/07/lnl_20150713_2205.mp3  It seems increasingly clear that the extremely harsh deal for Greece is primarily about scaring the shit out of Italy and Spain, whose debts make Greece's look like nothing.   The Euro and its administration are basically destroying European democracy.  Germany has just shown its true colours and it's clear that underneath the talk of Greek 'responsibility' and 'tax reform' etc is the bad Germany, once again. Where did the cosmopolitan, ecological, social-democrat Germany go?"

TrueReddit,3d596s,deadlast,18,Mon Jul 13 19:33:18 2015 UTC,"Ye know, it is worth taking things with a pinch of salt.  Clearly Varoufakis has his side of the story, as would those with whom he had a conflict, and we should evaluate whatever is said carefully.  But I don't get the sense you did that either. I get the sense you were expecting a blame diatribe, and you luckily enough you found one. What a coincidence!  If any of the things he said are true, it's a huge deal. We're talking about an autocratic core to this big democratic project, and a core that could subject us to any conditions it wants, and who will destroy anybody who gets in their way.  You cheapen the implications of these things, given by someone who was there, by applying the bias it appears you had when you came in. You simply and reduce them to fit what you already believe. So in that sense, you're not doing any better than the one you criticise.  Moreover, from the most high-level perspective, I can say that everytime Syriza capitulated, the Creditors demanded more. Twice they had plans given to them that were 95% or more of what they asked. Twice they demanded more.   The plan Schauble came in with yesterday, with 5 year temporary exit etc was considered to be insane, by people who were there. Nobody thought it was an actual policy document--just read the journos threads about it from the day before.   Then, however, it unexpectedly ends up as the dominant draft position, and rather than accepting the package Syriza offered, which was 100% complete concession, the entirety of remainder of the meeting was instead fending off an even more austere, even more humiliating, even more vindictive notion. The kinds of demands of Syriza are not that far off the Treaty of Versaille and it's crazy to think the Germans were the ones demanding it.   Thus, you may think he's bitter and childish, but at least he's been coming around with the same narrative, and we keep getting more and more indications that he was right. The more details we get about who said what to whom and when, the more of this 'agenda' you lambaste him for arguing becomes apparent."
TrueReddit,3d596s,tones2013,-4,Mon Jul 13 22:22:14 2015 UTC,"It's ironic that you have projected onto me that i project onto the piece.  Varoufakis has been deeply unprofessional from the start, from repeatedly failing to recognise his countries weak position to his public personal comments about specific negotiators.  Now he says the whole thing, literally the whole EU, is a giant conspiracy against him personally. You're right: if 5% of this were true it would be amazing stuff. But with zero evidence and a much more plausible explanation (that he is a fool), why should we take anything he says seriously at this point?  He's a washed up politician who only got power by promising more spending, lower taxes and less borrowing. When he failed to deliver he not only lost his job, he left Greece in an even worse place than when he started. Best he keep quite before people notice how badly he ripped them off."

He said:   In Varoufakis’s account, the Troika never genuinely negotiated during his five months as finance minister.   The whole thing, the IMF, the other EU leaders, national governments, they were all in on it together:   “There were people who were sympathetic at a personal level, behind closed doors, especially from the IMF.” He confirmed that he was referring to Christine Lagarde, the IMF director. “But then inside the Eurogroup [there were] a few kind words and that was it: back behind the parapet of the official version. … Very powerful figures look at you in the eye and say ‘You’re right in what you’re saying, but we’re going to crunch you anyway’.”   So despite failing to keep his job, failing to negotiate a settlement, failing to keep the banks open and failing get any sort of relief for Greece, he still thinks he was right.

TrueReddit,3d9d9n,libelecsBlackWolf,11,Tue Jul 14 14:58:35 2015 UTC,"I feel like Arthur Chu, whether he likes it or not, fills the palatable ""safe"" version of the ""reformed nerd"" image, while at the same time completely validating every mainstream fear of nerds as dark bitter and anti-social individuals, tapping away at keyboards in a dark basement, and who are barely keeping back from stalking and raping everything with a vagina.  A lot of his words, I think, are just pandering to non-nerds' fear of what they don't know.  Reading him, I find it his dark description of nerds extremely hard to reconcile with my own experience.  I, too, was raised in a socially conservative Asian home, didn't go on a first date until my Senior Prom, and didn't have a girlfriend until I had graduated from college.  My friends and I played dungeons and dragons, devoured science fiction books, and larped with homemade wooden weapons before we even knew what larping was.  I had never ever felt any misogynist feelings, nor any urge to rape anyone even when my high school crush (who, in hind sight was open to me and probably driven away by my own social blundering) invited me to her house for a swim and ended up falling asleep in her bed with me as the only other person in there (I think her mom went to drop off some of the other kids).  In fact, the most misogynistic things I heard came mostly from my jock friends who regaled me with stories of copping a feel on cheerleader's breasts after football practice, or which popular girl was particularly slutty.  I've never ever felt the kind of bitter darkness that Chu describe beyond a deep pang of loneliness and later on desire to improve my social skills which manifested in starting to work out and taking up social dancing where I ultimately met my wife."
TrueReddit,3d9d9n,sylkworm,6,Tue Jul 14 17:20:43 2015 UTC,"Yes the ""mainstreaming of nerd culture"" has been much talked about in the wake of Eliot Rodger/Gamergate/Aaronson. And nobody seems to get that the otherwise normal, happy people who happen to like RPGs and superhero movies and the people who are overcome by their anxieties and fixate on safe-but-boring hobbies are not all the same people.  That's why stereotypes like ""nerd"" do more harm than good and are best left in the high school cafeteria with the disgusting tater tots getting soggy in a puddle of chocolate milk.  It is both unfair to the ""pop culture nerds"" to lump them in with truly dysfunctional individuals who share the same interests, and it's unfair to people with real problems to say ""you guys are on top now, what more do you need?""  And who do you think is letting the nerds who get away with raping, stalking, and assaulting women do it? Chu seems to think the burden was on him, self-appointed nerd king. It's actually the police and judges who by and large aren't nerds by any means.   As you said, there is just as much if not more misogyny and actual aggression against women among ""jocks"". This is the ""boys club"" from which the police who do nothing about rape complaints come from. Some of them played D&D too, it's not simple.  Then there is the implication that if nerds are automatically unsuccessful with women entirely through faults of their own (being ""nice guys"", etc) then the ""normal"" guys must automatically be doing something right, and if someone gets married and you don't it's because they ""respect women"" more than you do. From there it's a short distance to the opposite stereotype that girls only like assholes.  Then again there are also lonely jocks and bitter jocks and jocks who go on shooting rampages where they kill their entire family. But they are just isolated incidents whereas nerds are bad because they are nerds and so of course they also do all this other fucked up shit. How is it that on one hand you have the domestic violence problem in sports and on the other you have sci-fi club alumni sleeping with freshmen and this is a thing for ""nerd culture"" to tackle? Have you never heard of football players sleeping with freshmen?  That's why Chu and Dr.NerdLove and so on are so offensive. They are just perpetuating this idea that if you don't feel loved you must be inherently unlovable and there is something very wrong with you.   That is not the message that we send to depressed young women who often self-harm or develop eating disorders and often believe that nobody will ever love them (or accept abuse and mistreatment as love). So why is it that the message aimed at men who feel the same way is ""take a shower and go to the gym, you disgusting pig? How dare you expect that anyone will love you when you've done nothing to earn it?"" And then of course the next message is, ""love/sex is not earned, it must be freely given, you entitled piece of shit."" And then, ""quit whining and do something about it you loser."""

MK Ultra is a bit of an odd case to bring up because it wasn't implemented by politicians, it was CIA crazies at the height of cold war paranoia.  It was actually found out and ended by politicians.  And even then, under the absolutely horrible paranoia that the US felt at the time it was conducted, if you had asked a random American how they felt about the CIA drugging a few undesirables in the pursuit of important mind control research that the Soviets could already be closing in on, the answer would have probably been pretty depressing.  We love to talk about how evil and inhuman our politicians are because it makes us feel better about ourselves.

Under our current structure where appropriation and funding are not separated powers, politicians, i.e., legislators should not be deciding or even influencing where, e.g., the military puts its troops or weapon systems, or where and in which state federal money is spent for what purpose. Politicians, i.e., legislators should only be focused on setting strategic, process based legislation in place that sets up systems rather than this micromanagement bullshit that we have now where every piece of shit is out passing and injecting their own special interest legislation."

And the politicians who can speak extemporaneously or write off the cuff don't get rewarded.

Hell, we even had an actor as President and many people are convinced that he was a great guy and president even though he was an actor with direct connections into the Hollywood imaging making machine. It's TV and movies come to life now in America, it's as if people believe what they see on TV and in the movie theater must really be what those actors are like.  In the case of actors it's usually a byproduct that many of them want to shake and some take advantage of for self promotion, but in politics it's almost the inverse, where they desperately try to buy and fabricate an image in order for you to believe something that isn't so; which is pretty much a basic type of fraud in how it happens in the USA today. ""Fraud - A deception practiced in order to induce another to give up possession of property or surrender a right"" What else do you think it is when politicians ""write a book"" or ""make a speech""? They don't put the author's name on the book, they don't announce that the historic speech they are about to give was written by a speech writer and the politician is basically nothing more than the speaker that translates the text signals into auditory ones."

And secondly, as this very article points out, politicians actually have an extremely large amount of input on what their writers put out.  They may not come up with the actual words, but it's weird that an article entirely about how a governor was overly controlling of his speechwriter would make you think that they are just teleprompter monkeys.

Why are so many people supporting this stupid argument? Is it because you subconsciously attribute the speeches someone else writes to the politician and you simply haven't separated and properly attributed them in your mind?  Following that logic, plagiarism should be perfectly fine, because that is essentially what you are talking about but even worse. Not just plagiarism, but someone else writing things for you. It's quintessential fraud. I guess we should allow people to pay others to write their university papers and dissertations? And journalists should be able to pay jobless English majors to write their stories?

Subsequently the Governor reappeared and reported that he had been in Buenos Aires, Argentina with a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair. He stated that in 2001 he met and became friends with this woman and that they started having a sexual relationship in 2008. His wife, Jenny Sanford became aware of the relationship in January 2009, and it was later revealed that two weeks prior to June 24 Sanford and his wife had begun a trial separation.

I like that sentence in particular, because I think many get distracted from the real problem by assuming intelligence where there isn't any.  American politicians aren't malicious overlords because they aren't good enough at what they're doing to be deliberately evil like that. They're mostly stupid, unconcerned, and busy themselves going through the motions of keeping their jobs. The problems we face as citizens are derived not from the efforts of a well oiled machine bent on our subjugation (that would be somewhat easier), but rather the combined effect of thousands of foolish people with more power and responsibility than they are capable of handling, fumbling like your grandmother with her first smartphone.  I don't doubt there are some out there who are intelligent, who work toward nefarious ends deliberately (similarly, I'm sure there's at least one out there who genuinely tries to do what they think is right for their constituents), but I do doubt that such an attitude characterizes the American government as a whole.

A humanitarian problem, like food scarcity or climate change induced droughts, pandemics etc., can results in mass death etc. Once the initial causes are in place, they are unavoidable. Even if we shut down all emissions this second, carbon already in the atmosphere is going to continue pushing climate change.   However, this issue is political and economic. Will our institutions find ways to keep living costs for young people low enough? Will they find ways to reduce youth unemployment? Etc. Looking at the greying advanced countries, these are the issues the young face. (They get advanced degrees, but can't get work, can't afford housing, because older populations are not retiring and bidding up prices) Will we increase retirement ages quickly enough? Americans, living longer and increasingly without pensions or sufficient savings, will work longer out of necessity. Working longer will both keep many Americans healthy longer AND it will reduce the strain on Social Security and other parts of the safety net. (Sounds terrible but it's true) Politically, there are many ways an elderly bloc of voters could slow down necessary legislation. However, there are also many reasons senior citizens will not vote as a unified group. For instance: poor Americans live shorter lives AND are less likely to get the deferred maximum amount from Social Security. (They also far less likely to find crazy loopholes that net them extra 100,000 dollars) It is not unreasonable to suppose that affluent senior Americans, would vote for legislation that raises retirement ages if it means they get an even better deal.   Generally, we hear constantly that ""Social Security is bankrupt!"" However, by most technical accounts, this is at best a misleading refrain. Even our catastrophist, Gordon Woo, acknowledges that Social Security is farsighted AND in decent shape. His worry is that necessary reforms won't occur to keep it that way. But given how often we hear this and how willing the public is to hear the worst on Social Security, I would not be the least bit surprised if a Presidential candidate ran on a ""Save Social Security!"" platform, that raised retirement ages, increased taxes, added more tax avoidance vehicles ( eg. IRAs, HSA etc.) that disadvantaged the poor. (Maybe à la ""Whats the Matter w/Kansas"", a political party would get the poor to vote for it!)

The author has formed long sentences with lots of conceptual interruptions, but she fails to convey what she means deliberately and concisely. The overall impression is one of muddled thinking hiding behind a veneer of sophistication.  In the first three paragraphs (that's all that I could stand to read), she   (1) mentions some sort of ""self-division"" which is caused by a conflict between ""desire of submission"" to ""established authority"" and ""long[ing] to break loose"".  (2) claims that this division, while personal enough to be ""given us at birth"" and related to an ""explosive longing or the freedom to define ourselves anew,"" is also responsible for ""cultural unrest"" and ""flat-out revolution"".  (3) tries to relate this division to ""alienation"" in which we ""became strangers to ourselves"" and which is caused by ""consciousness.""  (4) supports such relation to ""alienation"" through a very bad misreading of Genesis and Freud. (She literally claims that the bible traces our ""evolution"" of consciousness from animals... I'm not sure what could be further from the actual wording of Genesis 3.)  As of the end of the third paragraph, we still have no idea what ""established authority"" the author is referring to. In fact, I suspect you can put almost any idea in there, and it makes just as much sense. The entire piece is fundamentally meaningless.  ~~  Tl:Dr number 1: Article is a verbal Rorschach blot test. You can literally read anything that you want to into its sentences of ill-defined concepts. Feel free to comment with your own crazy interpretation!  Tl:dr number 2: This looks like a book review. Just read the Tao Dae Ching. You'll get a more nuanced sense of humanity's strugle against established structures, and it's more readable to boot."

The clinic worked with a biomedical research company that sent tissue off to reseach institutions doing stem cell research, cancer research, regenerative tissue therapy.   The clinic was reimbursed for the time it took medical assistants at the clinic to consent the patients for the procedure and procure the tissue or blood sample needed after the procedure was completed. That's it. PP is a nonprofit, so like the doctor says in the full video, ""Really their bottom line is, they want to break even. Every penny they save is a just pennies they give to another patient. To provide a service the patient wouldn’t get.""  I'd say 75% of patients were happy to contribute to cures for cancer and Alzheimers, as most of them have known someone who has been affected by the diseases. Participation was completely voluntary. Some patients would specifically ASK to donate as well.  She is a doctor who believed the actors were biomedical researchers. She used medical terminology, and she believed she was speaking to scientists. I am sure if she knew she was going to be taped she would have phrased her answers differently.

The crux of the matter seems to be the that (a) it's illegal to sell parts of aborted fetuses, but (b) it's legal to donate parts of aborted fetuses, and the costs of donation can be recovered. Despite all of the hand-wringing and axe-grinding, there's scant evidence that (a) has happened; black-market prices for organs (tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars) are considerably higher than the costs mentioned in the video (a hundred dollars or less). Planned Parenthood asserts, via press release, that the situation is solely (b).  Everything else going on here, everything else, is banging on idea of purity, to try and elicit a reaction of disgust. Read the comments over at Hot Air; everything's all ""killing babies and illegally selling their parts"", ""Mengele’s experiments"", ""talks them into having an abortion because the mills must be fed"", and ""This is what happens when people allow themselves to be taken over by the devil"".  Additionally, the organization (Center for Medical Progress) which was behind the claimed thirty-month investigation has no presence older than a few months, and their website is currently down. This might not mean anything, though; not everyone has a significant internet presence.  The result of all this will almost certainly be that Bobby Jindal runs an investigation, nothing is found, and a couple more people will, when they hear the words ""Planned Parenthood"", say to themselves, hey, aren't they the people who use my tax dollars to trick women into buying abortions so they can chop up babies and sell them for big money?"

One thing you're right about is that we do currently live in a capitalist society, and this needs to be reckoned with when addressing climate change. But that goes both ways: not only do we need to consider solutions that mobilize capital to fight global warming (e.g., by incentivizing green initiatives), but we also need to contend with the inherent shortcomings of our capitalist system when it comes to wealth distribution and exploitation. As an example, we don't find a just solution by creating portable solar cells for individual household purchase coupled with strict regulations or bans on fossil fuels, if it means either (1) that lower income people can't afford the green technology and that they're therefore either penalized for sticking with carbon or forced to forgo reliable electricity altogether, or (2) that manufacturing of this tech is outsourced to third world countries where workers are horribly mistreated, exploited, and payed pennies on the dollar for their labor.   In other words, we need to be thinking about capitalism not just in terms of its potential to produce innovative solutions, but also in terms of its tendency to widen pre-existing inequities. As a society do we pursue solutions that only benefit those who can afford to participate, or do we invest more in collective possibilities, like green public transportation?"

It's pretty clear why we continue to have food stamps and other programs to assist the poor today. It's not because of our two corrupt ruling political parties -- and certainly not because of American voters -- it's simply because if the rich people who control/fund both of our political parties removed those programs the poor would literally rebel.   they don't give to charity,   We certainly do. We have millions of caring and moral people. But that has little to do with global warming.   they don't help their neighbors?   Sure we do.

The large plops especially accelerate more melting.  methane releases from thawing permafrost is also a major accelerator.

Every lie that supports doing nothing has widespread silent acceptance because doing something involves sacrifice no matter how small, and there are actually relative winners from property owners above the flood lines. and its easy to presume that warming could improve climate in some areas.  No one will burn down government and commercial property over the burden placed on someone else's grandchildren, the generation 100 years after that, or the billion year timescale of solar expansion or universe contraction.  They may burn down things over austerity measures designed to show concern for future generations.  There are actually relatively cheap geoengineering solutions to all of this.  Make the poles colder:  More clouds at the poles.  Massive desalinazation/Iceberg harvesting.  co2 and methane capture/atmospheric scrubbing.  Another general point, is that if the world does not care about civilization collapsing in 2100.  It won't care about a worse collapse in 2200.  IMO, we need to stop pretending like people genuinely care, and instead shame them for their genocidal murderous selfishness.  edit: A new satire subreddit has been created  /r/HighlanderSupremacy to explicitly advocate for the extermination of lowlanders affected by global warming.

We've all contributed to it in many ways in search of comfort and convenience.  And we allowed ourselves to believe that what we were doing was OK, because everyone else was doing it.  So if it's murder, it's murder beneath the cloak of collective action.    Moreover, as a former ""denier"" I will tell you that one of the main reasons for my denial was the ""planetary rape"" rhetoric from a lot of environmentalists in the '90's.  Those kinds of attacks tragically encouraged me hardened my views by painting all environmentalists as anti-industrial moralists.  The ""rape""  and ""human cancer"" description is apt ecologically but not morally.  The problem is not rape, it's negligence.  In the third place, we no longer need to get people to worry about caring for future generations; the effects of climate change are happening at a much faster rate than predicted.

TrueReddit,3d046o,Godspiral,9,Sun Jul 12 17:48:31 2015 UTC,"the alternative to shaming their selfishness is to convince them to care.   That's a false alternative. Not only are those two options not mutually exclusive, they are in fact mutually entailing. Someone can't be truly ashamed about hurting something if they don't actually care about it, and they cannot truly care if they don't also feel shame about hurting it.     This is actually an impossible task.   The impossible task is trying to invoke a sense of shame without also invoking a sense of care.   The example of gay marriage illustrates this point. Actual homophobes who are not currently speaking out against gay marriage are not refraining from a sense of shame.  They are merely holding back temporarily to avoid a social media shit storm. That's not shame, that's just fear, and unfortunately for many LGBT, that fear will almost certainly not be enough to prevent a massive backlash from occurring against them in the event of an environmental collapse.    Shaming those people who don't really care from being labelled selfish genocidal murderers similarly to the stigma of being labelled homophobic is enough to get that vast majority out of the way,    Here's a thought experiment for you. If there was a drug that we could slip into the Budweiser's of all the reckless haters that would make them all care about the environment would you applaud its use?  Leave aside the legality of consent if you will, and just focus on the outcome.  Imagine if you will that the drug is administered accidentally as a byproduct of introducing a new yeast into the brewing process and it was highly effective and perfectly safe. Would you approve?  I assume that the answer is yes and that you would welcome this sudden transformation. It could be a game changer. Not only would there be considerable less opposition to fossil fuel reduction and clean energy, we would see a heightened interest in reducing consumption.  These people would all stop supporting factory farming and they would all want to buy locally and  pay more for sustainable goods.  This all sounds pretty good, right?    But here's the thing. The drug works so well, that these enviro-haters are completely reformed. It has a kind of cathartic capacity with respect to shame. They feel some shame about their past, but it's not the kind of cowering fear that you call shame. They feel a sense of sadness about their past abuses, but hey are like Ebeneezer Scrooge after the night's work of the 3 spirits. They feel shame, but they are mostly renewed with an overwhelming sense of love and caring for the planet and for those who share that love.  They do not suffer intensely for their past.

OK.  There is no social shame in murdering the taliban, because our society approves their treatment as subhuman savages.  It does affect all Americans deeply, in that almost all of them would prefer the 10s of thousand dollars it costs to murder muslims as a cash dividend, and all of them (outside oil industry) would prefer policies that do not destabilize the middle east in order to keep gas prices high.  All of them would prefer to not morally justify their own murders, and targetted hatred, as a result of compliance with the war.  Its also worth objecting that the authority to kill muslim babies is just a precursor to the authority to kill us all.  Those most affected, are those who thought they were signing up to a super generous scholarship program, and who instead have been conscripted as slaves to conduct the murders at high personal safety risk.  Our society is programmed to heroify and glorify the slaves' expensive baby killings for higher oil prices and retributive hate.  That is a partial motivator that encourages more Americans to sign up for the US military than for ISIS.  If there was more of ,what I call, shame applied to that behaviour it would be more discouraged.  Most of your point is that fear of repercussions is more appropriate language than the term shame.  I basically agree with you that it is not so much about forcing people to regret past immoral attitudes, but getting them to change their current ones through social pressure.  Create social stigma for acceding to evil such that only the evil (those with direct profit from social policy) are left to counteract the social pressure against evil, led mostly by those oppressed."
TrueReddit,3d046o,Godspiral,2,Mon Jul 13 03:18:25 2015 UTC,I think we both basically agree with Aristotle's view that the most powerful way to persuade people is with appeals from ethos. Where we possibly disagree with respect to how to best make those appeals.  I tend to believe that these kinds of appeals are actually very difficult to accomplish because they require character traits on the part of those making them that are difficult to acquire.
TrueReddit,3d046o,optimister,2,Mon Jul 13 07:27:35 2015 UTC,"Ethos is relevant, but there is a step above that.  We all agree that our social rules should include a ""pledge"" to not murder or steal.  There is collective utilitarian argument for those rules in addition to a moral one.  But there is an individual utilitarian view that could see a way to get more stuff by killing and stealing from victims.  Part of the utilitarian calculation involves being smart enough not to publicly argue against the restrictions on everyone else's killing and stealing.  The key point in dealing with these people is that they may completely understand the moral and social utilitarian argument, but they just don't care.  Identifying those people and pointing them out through shame and persecution is critical to the social cohesive policies.  If I dump you naked at the north pole or into the tiger cage at the zoo, then you may call me a murderer even if nature is the actual killer.  You may also view that I have a responsibility to assist someone stuck in a tiger cage, and that laughing at their misfortune is in bad taste, or claiming that he will just make new kitten friends in the cage is a dishonest lie.  Property loss and death as a result of sea level rise is a worst (responsibility wise) ""crime"" than letting someone be harmed by tigers or cold due to the contributions we all make in putting them under water.   persuade people is with appeals from ethos   That appeal though is simply that ""they should care"".  You and I can both understand that we should care on moral/ethical grounds, but whether we actually do is a completely independent outcome.  If you surveyed views on addressing climate change, those in the oil industry and those who do a lot of driving would tend to favour less action.  While they might say they don't understand the above argument, you can safely presume that first they decided they wished to ignore harm to lowlanders, and then adopted arguments that support that position.   they cannot truly care if they don't also feel shame about hurting it.   we can't make anyone ""truly"" care.  We can only force them to STFU regarding their promotion of murderous genocidal selfishness.  There is also a much larger group that is indifferent about caring.  They actually accept the moral principles, but don't care about promoting or denying the promotion of action towards enforcing the moral principle.  Holocaust denial is a crime in many jurisdictions, and heavily persecuted even where it is not a crime.  If someone sent me a link that said some of the 6M claimed jews killed were gypsys and homosexuals, and that another 1M of the 6M is exaggerated, I might not even read the link because the ""best"" outcome of the information is joining a socially ostracised perspective.  I kind of care that propaganda is bad, and kind of care that governments not force genocide on anyone, but I only really care about genocides that adversely affect my loved ones, and really care about maintaining socially approved views.  That silent ""mildly supportive"" majority group is actually the most important.  If the conflict is only between the 1% (or 19%) that cares about maitaining evil corruption, and the 20% that care about not drowning, then the 20% have a legitimate chance of winning that conflict if that middle apathethic 79% are not made into the 1%'s zombie voting block.  So, in my view, if siding with climate deniers is stigmatized similarly to siding with holocaust deniers, and the clear logical equivalence that the view is one of murderous genocidal selfishness, and so proponents are in fact pro-murder and theft, that would obviously lower support and manipulation capacity for those intent on profiting from the collapse."

Shaming has an important role to play, but it only works if people also have some kind of path to redemption.  If you really wanted to convince people, in addition to shaming them for what they have done, you will also encourage them to change.  You would focus on solutions as well as problems and encourage their adoption.  The success of gay marriage was not merely brought on by shaming, more powerful than the shaming campaign were the positive arguments for gay marriage, such as the argument from love.       if siding with climate deniers is stigmatized similarly to siding with holocaust deniers,   ...then the one's who need to hear the message about climate change the most will stop listening.

In a similar way, if you try to argue that all deniers and their supporters are knowingly trying to bring about an environmental apocalypse, you should expect to be ignored by the vast majority of them.

The voices that helped to convince the most me were the firm and steady ones, they would amplify certain points to convey a sense of urgency, but there was nothing that could be mistaken for a kind of gleeful malice."

While you are one thousand percent correct that politicians have ulterior motives when they soundbite popular appeal stump speeches, the primary facilitator of such evils is a country divided and biting at one another in an us-versus-them zeitgeist.  Corruption thrives on the ""slave race"" (Nietzschian; i.e., those not in power) being at odds with itself and struggling to keep afloat with just enough conveniences to act as a pacifier.    I would care about civil rights, gay rights, anti-discrimination laws, Clinton's housing subsidies for poor families to live in wealthier neighborhoods, and so on, for one self-invested reason: they unify us.  And once the slave race has a modicum of fresh air and unity, they - as a whole - can turn their attention to those who would destroy.    tl;dr, gay marriage does effect you, because Kumbaya is a really powerful song."

TrueReddit,3d046o,Godspiral,2,Mon Jul 13 03:31:13 2015 UTC,"Do you think we could cool the poles enough with the energy available?   Yes, putting sulfides in the air has been proposed as a solution to Global Warming since the LBJ Administration(as in, government scientists proposed it in a report).  Putting this into the air would reduce the luminosity of the sun by enough to cool the planet. There doesn't seem to be any real doubt that it's within our technical abilities.  There are a few problems with it.   It doesn't do a damn thing for the acidification of the oceans, which will keep on absorbing huge amounts of carbon.  So the temperature may cool/plateau but the oceans would be just as dead. It might do some damage to the ozone layer It would likely encourage people to kick the can down the road regarding carbon emissions, which doesn't really solve the underlying problem.  Why cut emissions if we can just keep making the sky darker?   Another possibility is using iron seeding to induce plankton blooms in the ocean, which would help sequester carbon in the ocean with a reduced amount of ocean acidification.  Rather less testing has been done in this realm, I think I read somewhere that 90%(!) of the annual iron production on planet earth would be required to create a bloom big enough to reverse/plateau the temperature.  Ultimately, drastic cuts in carbon emissions have to be made.  Some of this will be happening organically(like once self-driving cars proliferate), but I doubt that that can achieve without government intervention."

The land in the area makes for a great challenge because it is so porous, water can simply go under any coastal defenses. Meanwhile, governor/lizardman Rick Scott banned the phrase ""climate change"" from being said in his administration. As much as I despite Scott, he has a perverse incentive to suppress climate change concerns. Miami in particular has been going through a real estate boom, and since the state has no income taxes, they require as strong a property tax base as possible.

Absent a better explanation, I tend to suspect that perhaps they would make the article seem less exciting.  The only available number for sea-level change (due to glacier/ice-cap loss) was the current less-than-1-millimeter figure;  intuitively and according to the article, this rate can be counted on to accelerate, but it puts a limit on the absolutely slowest possible arrival of a 20 foot increase in sea level, which is 6096 years.    That was slow enough to send me searching for further info.  The wikipedia page on Future Sea Level Rise gives a couple of figures.  In one, an estimated 3mm average annual rise has been measured over the past ten years.  This extrapolates out to a 'slowest' rate of 20 feet in 2032 years.  An estimate of 1 meter rise over the next century seems to be (from the article) seen as towards the higher end of possibilities but entirely mainstream;  this could be extrapolated to a 'slowest' predicted rate of 610 years.  So, while the sea level will continue to rise after 2100 --- and may do so as an irreversible consequence of events over the coming decades --- and while the rise will undoubtedly accelerate, the article is addressing a change which will take place over at least a few centuries rather than decades."

On Antarctica the deficiency increased by 75%.

Because surely we can.  I've asked this question before, and apart from Tomorrowland's trite answer of ""stop spreading negative mindwaves, man"" I haven't really seen a good one.  I, as an individual, can only do so much in my personal life. I'm cutting down my gas consumption and taking public transportation. I'm biking where I can. I'm looking at making my next vehicle electric. I'm pushing for politicians that want to build more nuclear plants and more renewable, low-pollution energy. I'm starting to save to outfit my home with solar panels when I buy one. I try to buy local goods and avoid buying things I don't need.  But domestic consumption is a fraction of industrial consumption and keeping track of how all the companies are doing in terms of their green record is mind-bogglingly complex. Getting the government on board with supporting better approaches is tedious (because of public opinion? because of the inherent slowness? who knows!)  At this point, I feel depressed whenever I read articles like this. There's only so much I can do at the individual level and it doesn't feel like it is helping. Wading into the ""but one study disagreed with you"" arena of activism feels pointless.   While the future is still unknown, the models look like they become pretty disastrous after 2100, if we don't change how we treat the world. And unless we learn the right lessons from this, who's to say that we will avert the next catastrophe.  I'm sure everyone here agrees with me, I don't really want to live in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and I don't want that for the next generations of my family. But so far, all I see is talk about how we're not doing enough.  So how can we do enough?  It sounds like what we need at this point is large scale change. Limiting ourselves to 2C is a challenge that only comes with rapid turnaround in how we approach the world. We can't be selfish individuals any more; we have to think globally and act as a species interested in our own survival.  I'm not sure how Europe feels these days, but I feel betrayed by the government and by the system (in Canada, and I think many Americans would agree with me). Democracy and free market capitalism have not done their job correctly. They have focused on building up a minor percentage of the population and proven ineffective at addressing long-term issues.   My prediction is that one of two things will happen: either we will see revolution or the collapse of Western civilization over the next century. And I'm not sure which one to cheer for.

Arctic sea ice - which is what has declined rapidly and is probably what you're thinking of (but which contributes little to sea level rise, as it is sea ice) - will likely be essentially completely gone during the summer in far less than 80 years, sure, but that's not all - or even most - of the multiyear ice, and many places are below freezing essentially year round, and likely will remain so for the foreseeable future - we're simply not going to get rid of all of the ice, so any continued warming will generally result in a continued loss of ice.  The Greenland ice cap and the Antarctic ice cap are much more important in terms of ice volume than the sea ice, and while both are losing ice, it's not at the same rate as the decline in Arctic sea ice (Antarctic sea ice is actually increasing, but this seems to largely be caused by the loss of Antarctic land ice), and current projections don't include a complete loss of the Antarctic ice cap (where most of the ice is), but rather, a fairly modest decline (in relative terms - it's still seriously bad news for us, as we could be talking several meters of sea level rise) over a couple centuries (for comparison, over the last 20 years, it has lost about 1000 gigatonnes of ice, but Antarctica contains 30 million gigatonnes of ice; even with continued acceleration, it's going to take a lot to melt all of that). Greenland is melting faster (it has lost about 3000 gigatonnes of ice in the last couple decades, and only contains about 2.5 million gigatonnes of ice), but it still isn't going to melt completely any time soon; the rate of ice loss would have to continually double roughly every six years to melt it all in less than a century.  Essentially, the problem is, while you're more-or-less correct about how rapid the warming is (although relying overly on your personal experience, which is biased by the small sample area your experience covers), you're underestimating the scales involved. Even in the case that we warmed Antarctica by an average of, say, 10 C over the next century, it would still likely take upwards of another century for the Antarctic ice cap to mostly melt (which would raise sea levels by something like 60 m)."

She always got a stiff neck and shoulders whenever she ate wheat.  This has never been a symptom of a wheat allergy or celiac disease, so I always considered that maybe it was all in her head.  But I've watched her my whole life being able to detect if the food she just ate contained wheat, because she said she could feel it.  I've noticed nothing my whole life related to wheat.  I've also been tested for celiac disease and tested negative.  It wasn't until a few months ago, I tried out a paleo diet for 1 month to see what would happen.  It solved all these problems that I didn't know I had.  I feel great.  I'm not tired all the time anymore.  I'm happier.  I have perfect clean no-wipe poops every time.

I've tested this out a few times now and I'm absolutely convinced that I have some sort of non-celiac gluten sensitivity.  My point is, I had absolutely no idea I had a problem with wheat because I've been eating it almost every meal my entire life.  Now that we know that nonceliac gluten sensitivity exists, I'm wondering how prevalent it is.  How will we ever know when everyone eats it every meal?

The ""roaring"" is likely the equivalent of a sugar rush; foods that are high in easily digested starch, such as bread, rice, sugar itself, etc, are described as having a high glycemic index. Consuming too much of such foods can generally predispose to a number of conditions such as diabetes, etc."
TrueReddit,3d2hsc,Banko,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:00:11 2015 UTC,"Glycemic index:       The glycemic index or glycaemic index (GI) is a number associated with a particular type of food that indicates the food's effect on a person's blood glucose (also called blood sugar) level. The number typically ranges between 50 and 100, where 100 represents the standard, an equivalent amount of pure glucose.   The GI represents the total rise in a person's blood sugar level following consumption of the food; it may or may not represent the rapidity of the rise in blood sugar. The steepness of the rise can be influenced by a number of other factors, such as the quantity of fat eaten with the food. The GI is useful for understanding how the body breaks down carbohydrates  and only takes into account the available carbohydrate (total carbohydrate minus fiber) in a food. Although the food may contain fats and other components that contribute to the total rise in blood sugar, these effects are not reflected in the GI.  The glycemic index is usually applied in the context of the quantity of the food and the amount of carbohydrate in the food that is actually consumed. A related measure, the glycemic load (GL), factors this in by multiplying the glycemic index of the food in question by the carbohydrate content of the actual serving. Watermelon has a high glycemic index, but a low glycemic load for the quantity typically consumed. Fructose, by contrast, has a low glycemic index, but can have a high glycemic load if a large quantity is consumed.    Image i - Graph describing the rise of blood sugar after meals.

I recently made chicken feet broth; it was incredibly good and cost me like $3 for more than I could even fit in my decent-size crockpot. But it also cost me a bit for gas (and much more to even own the car), and I don't think many people in my circle have any idea that chicken feet are even edible or how to use them. Lots of food options exist that are incredibly cheap because of their obscurity and/or difficulty to prepare. But if your parents ate fast food, or from food pantries, you sure as hell don't know how to find or utilize those cheap options.  Marketing plays another role, sure. I don't think it's useful to discuss ""psychology"" as a monolithic entity, compared to specific facets of behavior. You can't ""cure psychology"", but you can cure overreactions to marketing, you can have strategies for procrastination or bad planning, or how to react to contradictory information from trusted sources.  And ""psychology"" isn't the only difference between the layabout and the incredibly productive person. It might be, or it might not.

Going out to eat used to involve days of research, and at one extreme, I found myself on the phone with a regional chain's supply manager - going through the entire ingredients list and cooking procedures, explaining to HIM where gluten might come in to contact with the food.  Now I can put in an online order at Pei Wei, pay an extra buck or two, and pick up an awesome meal - that I know is really gluten-free - in 10 minutes. Or, get this: I can go to a REGULAR grocery store and buy a pizza. Or pasta. Or chicken nuggets. Chicken fuckin nuggets! Holy shit! You have no idea and I have no expletives to really convey how exciting it is to buy a frozen pizza for the first time in a decade.  Not to mention, the rate of diagnosis is increasing rapidly. 11-12 years ago when I figured out what my health problem was, only about 3% of statistically expected Celiacs were actually getting diagnosed in America. The median time to diagnosis was close to 14 years from the first complaint of symptoms. In 2009, eating out in the U.S. was impossible, but it was no problem when I travelled to Ireland - every pub chef knew exactly how to put together some gluten-free grub.  Is there some overshoot and over-diagnosis in America's attempt to stop being so damn far behind? Probably, mostly within alt-med communities. If they weren't bullshittin' about gluten, they'd be bullshittin' about something else. But they use gluten as the villain because the odds are on their side. Diagnosing gluten sensitivity, among groups who have chronic undiagnosed illness, is like hitting the broad side of a barn.   And is there really a trend? It sort of depends on which marketing firm you trust. One company says the number of gluten-free Americans has been pretty steady at 7% - another company came out with an often-quoted but hard to believe 30% number, but they say the trend peaked in 2013 and started to decline. As far as grocery store options go, I'd say things have been pretty steady since 2011-2012 so I am more inclined to go with the lower, steadier estimate.  7% also fits rough estimates for the total number of people with Celiac Disease, non-Celiac gluten sensitivities, and FODMAP intolerance. All of those groups benefit from wheat-free food, so here's to hoping the demand is sustainable, and calling it a fad is the real fad that will burn out..."

So Greece has arguably changed to priorities financial success. But that does not mean it has actually reformed anything. Just that politicians buzz words have shifted emphasis."
TrueReddit,3d10oc,ravingraven,2,Mon Jul 13 11:33:41 2015 UTC,Where did you get that from!?  The OECD says:   The reform responsiveness rate indicator is based on a scoring system in which recommendations set in the previous edition of Going for Growth take a value of one if ’’significant’’ action is taken and zero if not.
TrueReddit,3d10oc,happyscrappy,2,Mon Jul 13 11:49:17 2015 UTC,"The chart next to it says only two policies were maintained. That doesn't sound like doing a lot.  The scoring system is basically a measure of what percentage of the previous recommendations were acted on. Do you know how many recommendations were previously recommended for Greece or what they were?  The specific notes on Greece are not as kind to Greece as the single graph you pointed to. They say that Greece labor productivity is still awful, tax evasion is still rife, it is still far below average compared its peers, etc. I think perhaps your use of this report as an OECD endorsement of Greece's reform is perhaps overly hopeful."
TrueReddit,3d10oc,ravingraven,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:32:13 2015 UTC,"Do you even know how to read?   The chart next to it says only two policies were maintained.   Not maintained. Retained! A lower number is better.   The scoring system is basically a measure of what percentage of the previous recommendations were acted on. Do you know how many recommendations were previously recommended for Greece or what they were?   Yes! It says it right there next to the chart. It is the Going for Growth priorities as set by the OECD over the years (each year has its own priorities).   They say that Greece labor productivity is still awful, tax evasion is still rife, it is still far below average compared its peers, etc. I think perhaps your use of this report as an OECD endorsement of Greece's reform is perhaps overly hopeful.   Reforms does not equal solutions. It is going to take years for Greek labour productivity to surpass the EU average."
TrueReddit,3d10oc,happyscrappy,2,Mon Jul 13 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"Do you even know how to read?   I do. Thanks for asking.   Not maintained. Retained! A lower number is better.   It hardly matters which word it was. I was using ""maintained"" to mean the same as ""retained"" in this case. And I don't see how a lower number indicates anything concrete about Greece's actions. The a low number indicates some combination of new directions by the OECD, a low initial number of directions indicated by the OECD and the number of items which were removed due to action taken. Just to give a corner case example, any country which had only 1 item in 2007 could not have a number higher than 1 on this chart even if they did nothing to change at all. Even if items were added because they got worse! [edit:] Given that they give exactly 5 for each country, the idea of having only 1 doesn't make sense. But it also means you can have goals change due to getting worse which would reduce the number still in effect.   Yes! It says it right there next to the chart.   No There are two measures here, one is number of priorities retained.  The other is the fractional measure is against the number which were mentioned by OECD. The retaining figure is against the number which were there initially (2007). There is no mention of how many were there in 2011.  You know, reading through the recommendations from this year, I'm very convinced these charts are useless. The problem isn't the charts, the problem is the underlying data. The OECD seems to select 5 items for each country (3 top line, 2 ""other key areas""), and the quality/value of each item varies incredibly in order to ensure they can have 5. If you get easy ones, you can knock them off and get a nice low figure on that ""retained"" chart.  When that chart switches to being referenced to 2013, then countries which got easy/piddling/unlikely to stick around anyway assignments this time, like Israel's ""Enhance competition in food industries"" will have a great leg up on having a low retention number.  Meanwhile, New Zealand, with its ""improve the efficiency of the tax system by relying more on indirect taxes"" will have a bit more work ahead of itself to clear this item even though the value if it is minimal and minimized by the descriptive text. Other countries just get a loose ""increase the efficiency of the tax system"", even when the impact of this issue is far greater (like in Greece).  And meanwhile Japan has to change its workforce makeup significantly to clear its item ""Strengthen policies to support labor force participation"", it has to increase the percentage of females 25-44 employed to 73% by 2020.  I would love to see what the goals set for Greece were in 2007 and the intervening years to see what goals were set and which were cleared and how.   It is going to take years for Greek labour productivity to surpass the EU average.   Especially given their labor efficiency growth rate figures are negative for both periods measured. Tough to catch up if you're constantly falling behind.  We're talking about a report that says that ""Priority should be given to ensuring that the multiple reforms introduced in the recession and recovery context are being fully implemented."" I still think you're overly hopeful by referencing this report as to whether Greece has really implemented reforms instead of just setting them."

I am not going to take your word against that of the OECD."
TrueReddit,3d10oc,happyscrappy,2,Mon Jul 13 16:45:07 2015 UTC,"Is this' Greece's 2007 report and recommendations?  http://glotta.ntua.gr/posdep/concrete/OECD/2007-OECD-38665552.pdf  Check it out, they fell for Greece's 27% GDP revision!  Also:  'A general concern that remains is that there has often been a gap between legislation passed on public sector reforms and their timely implementation. Thus, a focal point of public sector reform should be to ensure that policies are fully implemented once the legislation has been passed.'  Ah, OECD, falling for the empty promises over and over. But still hopeful!  If these are indeed the recommendations which three do we think were implemented?  Minimum wage cut would be one for sure. And it is a significant one, at least for a while. It was reversed later:  http://www.businessinsider.com/greeces-new-government-is-already-hiking-the-minimum-wage-and-reversing-privatisation-2015-1  Is there action or measurable progress on the other 4? Can we really say 3 of these were solved enough to no longer be considered outstanding?

This article about the elaborate lies to cover up the rape and subsequent pregnancy of an actress is a prime example. It also shows the way talking about rape and the way women are treated has been greatly beneficial. Loretta Young didn’t have a word to describe what she went through and lived a life filled pain as a result.

Reusing the same headline and dramatically changing the body of the text smacks of revisionism. In a more layman's terms, both facebook and reddit show that a comment has been edited since the original comment - I find it startling that a so called major news source would not do the same for the article."
TrueReddit,3cx36x,Telid,47,Sat Jul 11 20:24:25 2015 UTC,"Perhaps over time news orgs will eventually come up with a better plan to address the versioning issue.  But as someone sit in a newsroom by day (not the NYT obviously) here is the problem with a separate post.  A one day story is not worth the time to create a separate post.  For the NYT, there are simply bigger fish to fry. Reddit and Pao's saga, while important to Redditors and those interested in the intersection of tech and online behaviors, has a limited shelf life.  Simply put, online visitors who shared the initial breaking story URL will unlikely share a follow up story, or even a more polished version.  And with bounce rate being what it is, it is not worth the time for a story that would generate limited exposure.  To me, the choice between a continuously updated article versus risking not reaching the audience is simple.  Not that the internet won't find a better balance in the future.

TrueReddit,3cx36x,aptmnt_,25,Sun Jul 12 10:22:40 2015 UTC,"That seems to be exactly the case. The first is a bare-bones, these-are-the-basic-facts story which served as a placeholder in order to get the news out right away, while the latter is a more nuanced article that would take more time to prepare (whether you agree with the nuance or not).  I think the problem here is that because such sites are text-based, we tend to think of their news model as comparable to newspapers, and are quick to describe this as ""editing"" the original. But in terms of how news is temporally delivered, we'd be better served by comparing it with television news.  When a new story breaks, news channels will throw together a breaking-news summary of the basic facts in order to not fall ""behind the story"", but at the same time, they get to work on a more detailed news package that will air later in the day (or week). No one describes the breaking-news piece as having been ""edited"" just because it gets replaced by a more detailed story in later broadcasts.  This sort of thing happens all the time in internet news. Look at sports sites like ESPN and SI.com after a game. As soon as the game is over, a very simple ""this team won, this team lost, here was the big play"" article will almost immediately go up, often comprising only 3 or 4 paragraphs. It's there just for the need to have an immediate story reporting the outcome (otherwise, the site will appear to be behind its competitors). Within an hour or two, however, a much more detailed article will replace that, often plugged in under the same headline. This is just the nature of news on the internet (delivered now, always now, now, NOW!) vs a daily newspaper."

White male jokes don't write themself as easily.  Yishan was Chinese.  He got some jokes but it always seem derived from taboo and shock not hate.  The Chairman Pao jokes were childish shock humor but I never really heard any racial stereotypes.  I really think the cries of racism and sexism in this case are some sort of distraction.  Activists are trying to write a narrative that fits their cause, when in reality people were just being mean to be mean cuz she stood up for some choices some people didn't like.

I remember when the Boston Bombing happened, how news articles spewed rubbish about ""hundreds dead,"" and silently lowered the death toll closer and close to reality as actual facts came in. TV news does it too. CNN was reporting every little stupid rumor they could find on social media, as if it were fact (often using weasel words to to cover their ass) and pretending it never happened when something more concrete came in.

It's one thing to extend an article new facts, or correct first-run statements with more reliable ones for breaking news.  That's been done since newspapers first came with morning and evening additions.  It's another thing to change the narrative of an article to manipulate public sentiment.  Hopefully high-end news sources will eventually institute policies to either not do this, or offer up some kind of version history at the top."

If an article is heavily edited, you need to mark the changes and why they were made unless the change was fundamentally typographical in nature. Even then, if the typo happened in a proper noun, it is usually best to err on the safe side and correctly.   The problem is that this was a case where the editor who made the changes simply didn't have any journalistic ethics."

Clickbait, article manipulation and the whole propaganda machine works because most people don't have the time or knowledge to vet their information and are responding to their emotions. I still do it all the time.  We, the people of the internet, are going to have to work together to start holding media accountable. Those of us that are taking on this problem are gathering at /r/sourcecheck, where we are hard at work on the beginnings of a platform to make it easier for all of use to be aware of these practices.  /r/TrueReddit has been wonderful at helping keeping other Redditors aware of manipulation like this.

The breaking story was cut and dry with facts: Pao left, why she left, when she left, what the company said.  The bigger context as seen through this story, of course, is the perceived sexism and racism online and within the Silicon Valley, plus the gist of the breaking story.  So if you could only pick one story for print the next day, which one has more context, and would help the people who don't know Pao or Reddit to understand what happened?

It had everything to do with someone in a position of power making moves to take something that a lot of people care about very much, and change it for the worse.

Most of us that see comments like that downvote them, but that isn't readily apparent unless it's enough to bring them negative.  Plus, how many people either saw the post before some of the offensive comments or didn't read enough comments to see the offensive ones.  I agree that there are many who see that sort of behavior as acceptable when it definitely isn't, but there really isn't a good way for the average user to do anything about it.  At that point, it seems like all we can do is report it to the mods and hope they remove it, but they're already typically overworked (hence the cause of the overall issue.)  Any suggestions?  I've been trying to think of a solution for a while now, but I've got nothing.  Edit: Grammar."
TrueReddit,3cx36x,PrimeIntellect,7,Sat Jul 11 20:00:23 2015 UTC,"On Reddit, too often it becomes a situation where you're ""feeding the trolls."" When you write a response criticizing someone for offensive language, all it does is give them another chance to spout off.   It seems to have worked reasonably well for me -- see the thread in question. What concerns me is the fact that these comments have hundreds of upvotes -- so it's not just that no one says anything, it's that many people appear to be supporting them, vocally or not.  In other words, in the Reddit community, these aren't the trolls. These are the prevailing mainstream view of Reddit. Yeah, if you come across someone who's actually trolling, there's not much you can do except downvote and disengage, and maybe report them.  Now, yes, if your sole criticism was ""your offensive"", you'd be laughed at -- this is the Internet, after all. But people do seem to respond to being called shitty people, at least sometimes. Because this mainstream view isn't blatant misogyny, it's misogyny-in-denial -- even the people I linked to don't seem to want to admit that they're anti-feminist or anti-woman, and they get defensive when you call them on it. Maybe if they faced this kind of criticism more often, they'd be less inclined to post shit like this in the first place.   Plus, how many people either saw the post before some of the offensive comments or didn't read enough comments to see the offensive ones.   I'm not complaining about the OP -- that's a separate discussion, maybe I should complain about them. But I linked to some very specific comments that were pretty near the top when I saw them."

She (and Yishan, to be honest) was primarily trying to change Reddit's target demographic. I think most of the backlash has come from the established users of the website who are outside that target demographic, and are upset with the displacement that is going on.  It's funny - in essence, people are upset that Reddit is undergoing gentrification."

TrueReddit,3cx36x,MarshallBanana,10,Sat Jul 11 20:09:23 2015 UTC,"Policy changes.  Can you help me understand which ones she implemented that were different from CEOs before her.  I know yishan started the ""move to SF""  policy.  Other than the ""safe space""  policy,  I can't think of another one that made the community angry.   Perceived censorship: I'm assuming it's the same policy.  Unless you know of another one.   SJW friendly capitalization (I assume you meant monetize).  Same policy.  SJW seems to be a demonized word for people who are OK with the ""I can't issue death threats against fat people policy.""   Communication : Yep,  she wasn't very good at this.  More of a frequency problem.  But fair.  Reddit CEO is different than other CEOs.    Firing of Victoria: This was kn0thing. It's been known for weeks.  He even admitted it was his fault not telling the mods.  Yeah, she's the CEO,  but this misinformation is just poor form.    So basically,  she had poor communication and kept some of the policies of previous CEOs.  Clearly cause for the vitriol she received.  And setting aside the larger silicon Valley gender issue,  there was no need to cherry pick any comments.  Every thread had hundreds of sexist/racist comments with thousands of up votes.

TrueReddit,3cx36x,Cartesian_Duelist,5,Sun Jul 12 00:43:23 2015 UTC,Good points all but he left out some other pretty relevant points.  ellen pao has a terrible track record and their is good reason to believe that she isn't exactly a nice person.  Her husband is in major debt and she has previously attempted to sue kleiner perkins to help pay for the debt. (Unless you are telling me you don't find it fishy that she was suing for exactly the same amount of money that her husband owed?)  Having somebody run a site that needs to be very careful about monetizing have a reputation for being a money grubbing idiot is baaad. Even if she stayed 100% rational (hah) that reputation alone would cause damage. More likely however would have been her suddenly pushing for tons of revenue at some point out of desperation which would inevitably cause issues.  If you're the copilot of a plane and the pilot starts steering the plane down and then grabs a parachute and jumps out. You are expected to grab the wheel and stabilize the plane because clearly the previous pilot has done something wrong. In other words if policies were bad before then she had the power to try and do something about it. She didn't therefor she still holds some responsibility for that.  As for SJW friendly capatilization the whole gamer gate fiasco shows that there is a surprising amount of cronyism/corruption in gaming journalism. As a self defense method they published articles demonizing anybody that questioned their methods. As a result many forums engaged in censorship and often they did it badly also cutting off people that wanted to have an actual discussion.  Even if she is off the hook for the victoria thing that still leaves the juicy firing the guy with leukemia story (TBH I don't have all the details on this one).  In the 21st century its extremely easy to attach lables to a group and demonize them. Point being censorship of legitimate hate groups can also lead to making it increasingly easier to censor anybody that happens to disagree with you by slapping them with a label.  FPH had it coming from what I read about it however so do many other subs that deserve to be banned for the very same reasons (which convenienently share the sameish beliefs as ellen pao/SJWish related shit). Selectively banning subs for commiting the same offenses is bullshit. They should either make no rules (everything that is legal goes) or establish clear rules and enforce them properly. Not the inbetween wish wash of horrors that we have now.  As for the perceived racism/sexism. I find it much more likely that people simply use whatever terms hurt the most rather then a large majority of our userbase being racist/sexist. I would rather say that reddit has a problem with being extremely easy to take along for a ride and start hating things/people intensly . It reminds me of 1984 and its 2 minutes hate.  Even if there are some sexists/racists that disagree with ellen pao for that reason that doesn't mean their aren't plenty of legitimate grievances against ellen pao.

TrueReddit,3cx36x,randonymous,5,Sat Jul 11 21:26:51 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about why 'cunt' feels sexist for a while. Here's my theory.   According to dictionary.com (linked at bottom cuz I'm bad at things), the primary definition of cunt is just vagina.  So when you call a woman a cunt, you're not only insulting her as a person, you're using her womanhood as a way to degrade her. A cunt is what makes a woman a woman, and the implication is that's a bad thing, thus it's bad to be a woman.   Just my thoughts, I could be off base. I also wonder if a similar argument could be made when a guys called a dick. I often see ""dick"" as ""insensitive"" or ""selfish,"" but I'm not sure what synonyms I'd pick out for cunt.  Anyway, if you had to describe someone called a cunt, how would you describe them?   Edit: sorry, forgot the link. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cunt"

I also hear of women being called dicks or alternatively wankers. You are overthinking and giving peoples choice of swear words far too much meaning.  Can we just accept that using certain words to insult a person doesn't automatically mean that you must subscribe to a certain systems of thought/belief?  People are just likely to flop any ol insult often enough. Alternatively they just use whatever seems most demeaning/painful to that person.

E.g.,   Perhaps, uncomfortable with his delight in a funny Burger King ad, for example, he hides it behind a hermeneutic study of the Double Croissan’wich. We are not fooled.   A core thesis of Kotsko's analysis of creepiness is that it involves claiming to know what the other wants better than the other themself.  Here Heller seems to be doing precisely what he (not without good reason) accuses Kotsko of doing -- a creepily ""deep"" reading that says more about what he wants to read than what the text says.  (Also, ""ogling them with his sourire figé""?  Is there some unwritten rule that all New Yorker pieces must contain at least X number of gratuitous French phrases?)"

""Narrative reality"". What does that even mean? In an age where popular narratives are intrinsically politicized, does the author maintain that rejection of all popular narratives is also tantamount to creepiness? Even if not, the mere suggestion that lack of compliance with a particular popular narrative in a casual sense can be construed as anything less than 'free thought' is saddening."
TrueReddit,3d143j,GaiusBaItar,5,Mon Jul 13 03:47:47 2015 UTC,"Creep etymologically started as synonymous with scary or frightening, perhaps a toned down version. I think it's come to have a secondary meaning synonymous with a scary sexual predator. A creepy pedophile or rapist type, for instance. Euphemistically, and following, it's come to label probably harmless men who want to have sex with you, but you don't want to have sex with. It's comic exaggeration to call the nerd a ""creep"", but accurate if he's a rapist.   Now that the modern usage of creep is so toned down, real sexual predators are called ""monsters"" or something else more appropriate.   I think the modern origin of the word comes from the 70s serial killer era where women thought any odd man might be a real threat. Awkward men and sexual predators were lumped together with the word ""creep"". For that era, it made a lot of sense. Today, it's losing its scary cache because I don't believe women continue to be as scared of random and/or awkward men, but I could be wrong. It's becoming a synonym of awkward."

As a guy it's well known that a nice gesture becomes more and more ""creepy"" the less attractive you are to the person involved.  If you go up to a girl at a bar offer to buy her a drink and attempt to strike up a conversation, the level of creepiness is directly proportional to how attractive that girl finds you. If you're hot, then your act is sweet and romantic, however if you have ""a face like a dropped pie"" then your act will be considered creepy and you're a pervert."

TrueReddit,3d143j,ManwhoreB,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:41:18 2015 UTC,"This is not true. The easiest way to not be creepy is to have realistic expectations, pick up on social cues, and respect boundaries.   If you walk up to a woman that is of similar attractiveness to you and behave like a well adjusted person (e.g. ""Hey, saw you from across the room and really dig your style. I don't see a lot of girls dressing like that. Did you just move here?"") you'll probably get a positive response and she may try to continue conversation. That's a huge green light. If you get terse replies, non answers, or disinterested body language then guess what buddy? She's not interested! And that's OK! Not every woman is going to be attracted to you, and that's not a problem! You're a complete stranger to her and she owes you nothing!  Trying to force conversation or manufacture a connection is really creepy. I don't blame guys who creep women out, I think they just haven't had two fundamental life experiences: having a woman as interested in him as he is in her, and having a woman be more interested in him than he is in return.  Yes, attractive men have an easier time. Yes, it seems like life's not fair. But hey, it is what it is. If someone isn't interested, walk away and charge it to the game."

That's how the ""awkward"", silent guy becomes the ""probably misogynistic Nice Guy"", or the nervous guy who stares at a woman in public transportation becomes ""probably a rapist"". And those are the kind of men who are often called ""creepy"" and of whom you see hundreds upon hundreds of twits, Tumblr posts and the like on the Internet under #creepy.

TrueReddit,3cwqaz,theonlymred,2,Sat Jul 11 16:54:12 2015 UTC,"The path to statehood for Hawaii began in the late 1800s, when it began to be exploited at a large scale by American agriculturalists, mainly James Dole (yes, that Dole) in the form of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company. This, believe it or not, was a hugely lucrative business. In 1893, in order to eliminate tariffs on imports to the US, a group of these agriculturalists with other American citizens living on the islands incited a coup d'etat which successfully overthrew the weak monarchy of the islands and established a short-lived, annexation-friendly republic led by, you guessed it, Sanford Dole, cousin to James Dole. Long story short, the now perfectly symbiotic relationship between the (American) planters and (American) government of Hawaii led in short order to Hawaii's annexation as a territory of the US.   Why statehood then? It was the confluence of three factors: the postwar decline in the power and presence of the planters (through descendants of immigrant laborers born in the territory gaining voting rights as birthright and eventually voting out of power the political party made up of planters), a very strong popular and political push for full voting rights of Hawaiian citizens, and finally, the postwar/cold war climate that saw the military value of the islands as immense - valuable enough to warrant statehood."

In a sense this to me was Pierluisi's argument in the article: that we can't have the same old discussions and think that PR wants or needs statehood for the same reasons as long ago or why other territories have wanted it. Rather, this is about the need for jobs, healthcare, and growth.

TrueReddit,3cxbap,jackaltackle,2,Sun Jul 12 19:13:43 2015 UTC,"I just read a book by former intelligence director of DGSE, the French CIA.  His theory is this (mixed with some of mine at the end):   The arab world is colonized. Muslim Brotherhood is created in the 1930s as an opposition to colonisation. At the same time, the idea of pan-arabic nationalism (with socialist ideas) is also created. After decolonisation, the Muslim Brotherhood fails and it is the pan-arabic mouvement that wins the fight, with guys like Nasser in Egypt, Sadam Hussein in Irak and Assad in Syria. The Muslim Brotherhood is hunted and all its members captured/tortured/killed. The ML creates Islamic Revolution Armies everywhere to fight the pan-arabic military dictators. At that time, Saudi Arabia becomes rich, it is religously illegitimate (Wahhabism is a scam compared to the legitimate Sunni kings in Morroco and Jordan). To promote their legitimity, Saudi Arabia creates lots of organisations to promote salafism, for whom SA is the legitimate holders of Mecca. The ML takes lots of petrodollars and start opening salafi mosques everywhere you can find Sunni muslims. In the fight against USSR, the USA pushes the most crazy islamists they can find to organise coups in dictatorships with socialist tendencies. SA support those US actions and make sure you can find salafists among those crackpots. USSR falls, SA gets wealthier, the ML gets more and more support from their salafists. Several secular/pan-arabic dictators are crushed and the ML is happy to try to come back and get power. But the ML is some bunch of greedy bastards. The people who where softly brainwashed by ML propaganda when ML was outside of power realise that ML are greedy bastards who want to reduce their freedom and take all the money that military dictators were taking before. The militay takes back power in Egypt and Tunisia. Arab sping is over. The ML organises terrorism in those countries to weaken the military leaders. European terrorists are lone wolves brainwashed by ML salafism but no operational control by ML. In Iraq, due to stupid US decision making, the Sunni minority is oppressed by the Chiit majority. The former Sunni generals and administration elite of Sadam Hussein help organise terrorism as a way to resist. After being bombed by the US, they hide into Syria (just like talibans hide into Pakistan where US bombing is not easy thanks to diplomacy). The US wants to topple Assad for various reasons. NATO provided support and weapons for ""pro-democracy demonstrators"". Sadam elite organises a much more efficient anti Assad rebellion based on their Iraqi terrorist organisation hidding in Sydia and exterminate the pro-democracy rebellion. The spy masters of Sadam know Assad spy masters very well, they worked together for decades. They make a deal: Sunnis will not attack Assad and his non-Sunni groups and will exterminate all pro-West Sunni rebels. In exchange, Assad will let them rule over the Sunni part of Syria that Assad cannot control anyway. Syria and ISIS are in a non-aggression pact, with the West as common enemies. The fancy Islamic State is created, with a puppet Caliph, while behind the scene the secret police of Sadam rules. The Iraqi Sunni leaders support ISIS as a way to get their independance from Chiit Iraq and its Bagdad regime. Syrian Sunnis are not given a choice. SA begins to think that it is going too far, that ISIS is not ruled by them. ML doesn't control ISIS. Oil money + cultural artefacts provide enough money to finance ISIS. ISIS is now an independant country with a seasonned elite ruling in the shadows. Kurds from Syria and Iraq are defending themselves and nobody is helping them. They are begining to say ""fuck you"" to everyone and want to create the Kurdistan they dream of since the end of colonisation. Kurdistan is 1/4 Iraqi, 1/4 Syrian, 1/4 Turk, 1/4 Iran. The Turks are begining to be afraid, the Kurds of Turkey are begining to dream of independance even more than before. Iran is waiting to see what will happen.   Conclusion :   Salafi terrorism promoted by SA and the ML is here to stay, both in the Arabic world and in Europe. ISIS is not controlled by anyone but ISIS Syria and Iraq will most likely loose 2/3 of their territory each. ISIS and Kurdistan will each be formed in the ruins. Turkey and Iran may lose their Kurds, things will get messy there."

I draw different conclusions.  SA must not allow terrorism.  It must punish all terror, evaluating under a clearly articulated and equal rubric.    ISIS can be pummeled by anyone willing to have a go, accountable for humanitarian compliance to the regional community.  No one can negotiate with violence:  either they fundamentally change objectives and tactics, or meet the concentrated wrath of all nations.    Since most are concerned about losing status, Nations can negotiate to lose equal percentages for a small regionally protected Kurdish state."

But if we're to believe reddit employees are talent more so than labor then they're not as replaceable and losing them when they choose to stay in New York is also interesting.
TrueReddit,3cudjk,pohatu,206,Sat Jul 11 13:59:34 2015 UTC,Did anyone else feel like the reddit community used Ellen Pao as a scapegoat? We don't know her role in a lot of Reddit's operations... (perhaps itself a problem?)
TrueReddit,3cudjk,spatiotemporalmatter,350,Fri Jul 10 22:02:14 2015 UTC,"Personally I am deeply troubled by the way reddit has responded to Ellen Pao. She's a CEO of a web company. She's not the devil. I 100% support anyone who wants to disagree with the CEO of a company's decisions. But it went way, way over the line in this instance.   I felt like anything any of the reddit staff did that was perceived as negative was immediately attributed to Pao. When Victoria was fired, Pao was blamed for it. This all despite the fact that we don't know why she was fired. A company has to make business decisions in its own best interest. I think the /r/IAmA mods were 100% in the right in the beginning with their reasoning that the admins need to communicate better, but that was quickly co-opted by the vocal group that simply wanted to embarrass and harass Ellen Pao. The CEO is responsible for the direction of the company, yes, but the CEO is not the only person who has power. Hell, I've never even met the CEO of my company. I could be hired, work there for a year or two, then fired without ever meeting him. And it's a company of less than 200 employees.  But I think the most uncomfortable part, for me, was the misogynistic overtones. I do believe that Ellen Pao did some things that deserve consternation or even condemnation. I don't agree with everything she did. But... what I saw, time and time again, was gendered slurs. She was called a bitch and a cunt more times than I can count. I'm a big believer in attacking people for the things you dislike about them. I revile Rush Limbaugh, but I don't make fun of him for being fat. Because that's not why I revile him. And when you do that... well, I think it says more about you than it does the person you're talking about. Anyone with eyes who cares to see can see there's a certain part of reddit that is deeply misogynistic. And I think those same people targetted Pao. And I find that downright tragic. Tech is an industry that needs more women and minorities, not less.   No matter how you feel about what Ellen Pao did as Reddit CEO, I would hope any reasonable person would be deeply uncomfortable with just how she was treated by the Reddit userbase as a whole."
TrueReddit,3cudjk,bigDean636,142,Sat Jul 11 03:30:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely here. Regardless of how I feel about some of the decisions made under Pao's leadership, I was repulsed by the way the hordes of Reddit responded. All the shit that was upvoted to the front page, the racism, the sexism, the people telling her to kill herself, the death threats, the fervent wishes that she'd die horribly. It was disgusting, and as someone else already pointed out above, the fact that this revolting garbage covered the front page makes it pretty clear that we're not talking about a small minority of Reddit that was involved in the hate."
TrueReddit,3cudjk,TeaMistress,73,Sat Jul 11 04:06:46 2015 UTC,"I think the reddit userbase should be deeply ashamed of how all this went down. Again, just because I feel the need to clarify, I abso-fucking-lutely affirm anyone's right to criticize decisions she made as interim CEO. But to call her names and paint her as some kind of super villain is over the line. And it makes me sad that this web site stooped to that level on so many occasions."
TrueReddit,3cudjk,bigDean636,52,Sat Jul 11 04:25:47 2015 UTC,I don't think you understand. She was being CEO while female.  Reddit had to take  a stand! /s

TrueReddit,3cudjk,realultimatepower,5,Sat Jul 11 15:42:23 2015 UTC,"Do I just not follow the right subreddits for this? I saw very little related to her gender, death threats, or anything else like that, and just a lot of ""she has a sketchy past, there are sketchy things going on, get rid of her"". And while I agree that's not very tenable logic (for reasons mentioned here - who knows how much she was involved in those decisions), that's far more understandable. The CEO is the public face of a company and has to shoulder a lot of the blame for what goes wrong (see Mozilla's CEO)."

TrueReddit,3cudjk,FlyMyPretty,53,Sat Jul 11 05:53:18 2015 UTC,You articulated how I have felt about this whole situation. I have never downvoted so much in my time on reddit then the past few weeks. I no longer want to be associated as a redditor due to the representation we have in public media.
TrueReddit,3cudjk,The_Decoy,25,Sat Jul 11 06:00:30 2015 UTC,Well previously it was child porn and leaked celebrity nudes. This year it's sexist and racism. But those were niche problems whereas this year's business is all over the front page.
TrueReddit,3cudjk,straydog1980,9,Sat Jul 11 07:18:58 2015 UTC,"Reddit stupidity has repeatedly made front page news. The Boston Bomber fiasco, the Fappening, this nonsense. The jailbait stuff wasn't worthy of front page because it's just good policy, and frankly such a no-brainer that it really didn't warrant attention.  My biggest issue with the Pao Affair is one of signal-to-noise interpretation. Reddit (and all other social media firms) cannot afford to ignore its userbase, because we are its product. If the userbase shrivels, Reddit falls.   But by the same token, interpreting the Reddit zeitgeist can be a bitch. Going by the standard web metrics would lead one to assume that strident misogynists and racists compose the majority of the site's users--which I don't believe to be the case. There's the further problem that even if that were the case at present, catering to that crowd may not be the best strategy to attract more users. By placating the current users the company risks the site becoming a niche community--in essence, playing a holding game, which is death for social websites.  So it's obvious that real care must be taken to sort the strident chaff from the comparatively quiet wheat, which are legitimate and unsettling concerns that admin-side development has stalled. There's no easy way to filter the nonsense, so missteps are possible.  I think misinterpretation is a big part of what's gone wrong at Reddit lately. A vociferous minority has managed to co-opt the bullhorn of the community and used it to spout bullshit. The executives have decided to ignore everything from the userbase in response, perhaps telling themselves that such a strategy is courageous. The problem was that buried underneath the wharrgarbl was a legitimate concern that the admins were not supporting a small but significant portion of the community (mods). It took a nearly site-wide strike--again, nearly buried under the noise of idle hate and irrelevant and overly wishful calls for the return of Victoria--for that legitimate signal to shine through.  I don't think that Ellen Pao was to blame for all of this, but I do think the organizational inability to connect with the community indicates a change of leadership was in order, and the CEO position was definitely the place to start."

The users of this web page have actually changed my opinion on free speech, and I'm much more in favor of limiting it because of how badly it is abused.  It's also made me stop supporting internet anonymity for the same reason.

TrueReddit,3cudjk,opie2,18,Sat Jul 11 16:44:25 2015 UTC,Totally. Facts seem to be scarce for me as I've been trying to figure out what all the pitchforks are about. I don't think anyone besides the actual parties involved even know why Victoria was fired. I've never even heard of her before that and now she's a fucking martyr.
TrueReddit,3cudjk,GeorgePukas,36,Sat Jul 11 06:18:15 2015 UTC,"Pitchforks are because it's June, when all the kids get out of school and have too much time to spend on reddit. So this year's drama was the /r/fatpeoplehate banning. Last time around, we had the /r/technology drama. Before that it was MayMay June and the removal of /r/atheism from the default set. There is a sort of pattern here to big drama events happening around June.  The closure of major subreddits was a statement of solidarity with the moderators of /r/IAmA, who closed their sub because they were unable to operate scheduled AMAs that day. The complaint was that the firing of Victoria is one more poorly executed and apparently quite stupid move in a history of the administrators unsatisfactory interactions with subreddit moderators. Karmanaut's response in /r/OutOfTheLoop sums it up well.  The trouble is that this incident, which as far as anyone can tell had nothing to do with Ellen Pao, coincided with residual drama over the banning of /r/fatpeoplehate, at the height of anti-Pao agitation. So of course rumors were spread about her involvement, and she took all the blame. It was excellent timing for those who have it out for Pao, and they took full advantage of the information vacuum to spread all kinds of bullshit.  Meanwhile, the major subreddit blackouts had their intended effect: a dialog was quickly opened by kn0thing in private discussion with group of prominent subreddit moderators and the subs all went back online. The dialog continued, with promises made towards improving future communication (itself evidence of that) and moderator functionality, exactly what was complained about. Shortly thereafter changes in staff roles were announced, placing two well-liked admins in charge of moderator issues. Krispykrackers was reassigned to act as a primary contact between mods and admins and Deimorz to work with her on feature development.  Among the mod community, this staffing change has been widely regarded as the best possible move for the admins to make in this situation. Currently, Deimorz is working with subreddit moderators publicly in /r/ModSupport (a new subreddit created by the admins for moderators) and privately in various forums to implement a series of simple fixes, as a demonstration of the admins renewed commitment to moderators.  The official apology which was released during the hubbub, which many users complained about being late, was recently reasonably executed. It was made on Monday in order to reach the widest possible audience on reddit, as any postings over the holiday weekend would not pick up enough steam to be visible for long enough. An initial apology was made in private directly to the affected subreddit moderators, which was generally taken well.  Unfortunately, with the just-announced replacement of Pao, the anti-Pao crowd just has more fuel for their stupid little torches. Strategically I would not have announced her replacement until after this stupid drama has simmered down, but the admins seem to have again disregarded reasonable timing (like they did by removing /r/atheism from the default set at the height of MayMay June drama, despite the two not actually being related) in terms of mitigating drama.  So since the main mods are busy keeping their subreddits running and working with the admins to come up with the best next steps for tools to develop and rules to flesh out, there has been plenty of room for agitators to keep the heat on the drama, and plenty of fuel for them. There is also still a bit of uncertainty in the mod community which has prevented the release of many major statements about the issue which could possibly cut down on the misinformation and hate-mongering.  I hope that provides some explanation.  Edit: Fixed a couple typos, as marked."

The drama continued with the removal of /r/atheism from the default set (a move which the admins claimed had been coming for a while and had nothing to do with the MayMay June drama), and was eventually calmed down through sheer force of moderation when the head mods of /r/atheism brought on a very large team of temporary moderators (disclaimer: I was part of that team)."

Then you must not support these things in the past, so you must be a terrible person"" is the implication - never mind the fact that many social justice groups and activist groups in general often disagree with each other).

As an observer, I'm certainly not willing for any personal change. But it is all very PR move shifting focuses away for the core complains of Pao towards long standing issues with mods. I'm trying not to shift this into some subreddit drama, but in situations like this what else could be done? reddit is a part of a corporate entity now, with prerogatives on profits and or market expansions.

TrueReddit,3cudjk,werebothsquidward,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:56:12 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, here is the worst possible way to fire one of your most visible employees (chooter), who is also one of the only one who works directly with your biggest ""clients/partners"" and on whom they solely rely (the IAMA, science, etc.. mods and the celebrities which bring a huge amount of positive exposure to Reddit through their AMAs) :   Don't plan anything beforehand which could ease the transition, don't put in place measures in advance to make sure that the employee's schedule could be picked up and carried on without her.  Don't talk about it or organise anything beforehand with the clients/partners that rely on this employee. Fire the employee in the middle of her shift. Now is the perfect time to try out your improvisation skills with the clients/partners ! Let's hope they don't get angry.    If you've got to fire someone, better plan for it, do it discreetly, and/or make it PR-compatible with the person being fired if it's a high visibility employee, and an employee who plays a crucial role within the company.   To say it was ""handled poorly"" is a huge understatement, and, for a company, it's kind of hard to say that they did everything right but that it's their consumers fault that everything went wrong, that the consumers ""poorly handled the changes"" they implemented; when companies implement changes that lead to consumer revolts, it's usually that they fucked up somewhere in the way it was handled; making sure the changes are accepted, or even celebrated, is also part of the company's responsibility."
TrueReddit,3cudjk,SuperBlaar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:57:27 2015 UTC,"Making sure changes are accepted and celebrated is the company's responsibility? It kinda sounds like you're outright blaming Ellen Pao for the shitty response to her decisions. She saw a hate group that was harassing users and making the site she was supposed to monetize look bad, so she banned it. There is no way the whiny manchildren of this site were ever gonna like it. What was she supposed to do, bake cookies for them? Pander to a hate group?  She made a tough decision that had to be made, and she did it before a huge media circus appeared in response to FPH and drew more negative attention to reddit. Because Pao preempted heavy media exposure, instead of blaming Gawker or some other media outlet like they did last time, they blame her.  If you think there was a way to make reddit celebrate her decision, you haven't been paying attention."
TrueReddit,3cudjk,werebothsquidward,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:07:45 2015 UTC,"It's not a question of ""who's fault is it"", it's just a question of how well the changes were handled by the company; yes, the company is responsible for the changes it implements and it is the company's task to make sure that they are accepted as well as can be, and, yes, such decisions could have passed with way less of a negative reaction; if they had simply worked with the mods of IAMA and the celebrities before firing chooter, for instance, the whole blackout probably could have been avoided, as the lack of communication was clearly one of the reasons to that reaction.  We don't know if such a decision preempted heavy media exposure; we do know it led to very heavy media exposure, through the reaction it provoked and the way it was done, and such factors are to be considered when you take decisions. It's these peoples' job to know what reaction their policies are going to provoke; you can't just lay all blame on the reaction when you're assessing how well that job was done. If all customers had stayed calm and decided to not interfer and to simply accept the company's change then she would have made a great job, but that's not how people work; you can't separate the way a policy was implemented from its reactions and consequences, and say ""well the policy was good so it was well done"".  Truth is, a whole lot of things could have been handled in a much more competent way; chooter's case is just the most obvious example of the fuck ups, and pandering to your userbase - even when they're acting stupid - is part of the job.  Also, you're concentrating on FPH, and not mentioning the other decisions which led to a bigger number of different, more influential actors also opposing her; FPH was nothing compared to what followed."
TrueReddit,3cudjk,SuperBlaar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"The only change she made that affected regular users was banning FPH and related subs. She was CEO when Victoria was let go but we know now that another admin is responsible for the decision. We also don't know why she was let go, and it could very well be a legitimate reason. The real issue that arose from this seems to be between the mods and the admins, and as far as I can tell regular users are only getting involved because their own lives are boring and they have nothing to do."

TrueReddit,3cudjk,RetardedSquirrel,27,Fri Jul 10 21:57:42 2015 UTC,Because fph was a subreddit largely about harassing and shaming real people.  People often posted pictures of others from their facebook feeds just to shame them.  It has little to do with being offensive or else there would have been far more obvious choices to ban as you pointed out. Fph isn't remotely the most offensive subreddit.  Harassing has been what they said since the beginning and it is very consistent with the subreddits they banned.  The original announcement was titled Removing harassing subreddits.
TrueReddit,3cudjk,AnythingApplied,14,Fri Jul 10 22:02:44 2015 UTC,"People often posted pictures of others from their facebook feeds just to shame them.   Simply posting images wasn't sufficient.  If that was the problem then /r/cringe, /r/punchablefaces, and related subreddits would have gone at the same time.    The problem with FPH is that the mods there were encouraging users to target users of /r/keto and employees at Imgur.  Transfag and Neofag were targeting a trans kid.  I haven't heard anything specific about /r/shitniggerssay, but with a name like that I don't doubt they were doing something nasty."

Pao didn't do anything new, anything that didn't already happen before (other employees have been fired, other subs have been removed) or install any new public agenda; it's just that this time it was done in a pretty poor fashion/poorly handled from a PR point of view. This ""PR 101"" thing sounds like bullshit to me, yes it happens a lot in politics (Varoufakis comes as a recent example), but here.. no actual results were produced, nothing was gained. FPH didn't have half the negative presence in media that other subs have (RedPill or CoonTown for example), and the ""revolt"", especially the mods one, seems to have truly came as a surprise, or at least the way it was handled seems to suggest that to be the case.

FPH mods were encouraging the bad behavior. Banning subreddits that break site rules or skirt laws isn't uncommon, just look at creepshots and jailbait.

TrueReddit,3cudjk,Walking_Pneumonia,11,Fri Jul 10 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"Here's one thing I don't understand about the whole thing: if moderators find it so hard to do the work why don't they throw a lot more resources at it? I.e. why aren't there a shedload more moderators?  E.g. lets say I'm a moderator of a sub with 8 million subscribers and I find anything at all even the slightest bit difficult, time consuming etc. then why does my sub only have 30 moderators? Presumably out of my pool of 8M people I would be able to find at least 1000 good people at the drop of a hat that that would be able to do moderator duties; help me delete spam and junk etc. Those people are already there and evident in the community so why aren't they being used?  In other words, why focus complaints on the tools when (presumably) by throwing a lot more labour or bodies at the problem I can easily overcome the tool limitations?  The pessimist in my thinks I already know the answer: they're doing this difficult and time consuming thing for free and the reward they get is that they're important people: they're part of an exclusive elite of 30 people that runs a sub of 8 million people. By appointing lots more moderators they dilute their power and aren't so special any more.  Is it that depressingly simple or is there some good reason these massive subs (or any largish subs) don't have a lot more mods, given that one of their complaints is that they find it so difficult to do their job?"
TrueReddit,3cudjk,Linlea,6,Fri Jul 10 22:07:48 2015 UTC,"E.g. lets say I'm a moderator of a sub with 8 million subscribers and I find anything at all even the slightest bit difficult, time consuming etc. then why does my sub only have 30 moderators?   I can only speak for myself, but I find that the more mods you add, the harder it is to get things done.  There's no company structure with managers and head people to make decisions.  Instead it's a very flat list of equals.  This works fine for the most part, but can be downright paralyzing on controversial issues.  Everybody has a say, and you need to find common ground.  This can be a very lengthy process; especially if it's a complex situation.  This has been my experience growing to a team of 10.  I can hardly imagine 30, nevermind beyond that."
TrueReddit,3cudjk,SquareWheel,4,Fri Jul 10 23:51:22 2015 UTC,"While I think you make an important point, a lot of the mod complaints were more focused on communication with the admins and proper modtools.   If for any reason a mod needed to contact an admin, which there are plenty, they would receive an untimely answer if one at all. As far as modtools go, what the majority of moderators are using to keep up with their subreddits are third party tools, while many other sites much smaller than reddit have much better ""infrastructure"" for the keepers of their content.   Also, particular to Victoria, communication with celebs was something done through her, and not the mods of /r/IAmA. So when she was fired, they literally had no way to contact the celebs (who may not be familiar with reddit) outside of making comments and asking users to upvote them.   This is probably a very crass explanation, if you would like to read more the /r/outoftheloop thread on the blackout will help. I would link but I'm on mobile."
TrueReddit,3cudjk,thenameisadam,6,Sat Jul 11 11:21:51 2015 UTC,"Sure, I know the backstory and the variety of complaints  But specifically the complaint about workload and tools is what I don't get. And it's not just a complaint voiced in this episode of drama, it's something that comes up often when there is any criticism of a moderator or a sub: that it's hard work and they do it for free and it takes up a lot of time and it's hard work that's hard work. But the obvious answer seems to be 'why are only 30 of you moderating 8 million people' when you probably easily have at least 1000 well known, well trusted, well respected people in your community you could instantaneously promote to help you."
TrueReddit,3cudjk,Linlea,7,Sat Jul 11 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that makes sense. It certainly seems most mods have an overinflated sense of self-importance. They must to essentially shut down one of the largest websites in the world because they feel ignored.   Although I would say many jobs entrusted to mods don't need a large amount of people, or would be hampered by that. I'm sure if the problems were simply not enough people to keep up with all of the off-topic or not allowed posts, they would simply grab more mods. Other duties like editing the css or setting the culture of a subreddit are better accomplished by a small group of people with the same vision, I think this is more about the admins inhibiting their efficiency, not necessarily there being too much work"

""oh, but it's easier to keep it clean down there, and besides... the ladies like it more!"" The most extreme response I got so far is from a ""feminist"" who called me an idiot and told me I'm insensitive to even bring the topic up because ""female genital mutilation is a very serious tragedy"" (agreed) but when you do it to boys, for some reason she couldn't properly explain, it ""isn't mutilation."" How's that for equality? (Of course, I've spoken with other feminists who are 100% on my side.) Changing all of these attitudes is going to require education and time.  Like most boys in this country, I was circumcised before I could give consent, but I really don't want my parents to face legal trouble for it. Am I resentful? Well, yes. I will never experience maximum sexual pleasure in the way that a man is meant to experience it, and that's just a plain fact that I have to accept.

Americans who speak out against this are a pretty small group, and you are right that most people just do not see this as being much of a problem. I get that, and perhaps I was wrong to use the word ""damaged."" I'll refrain from doing so in the future.  To me, personally... look, my penis functions and sex and masturbation are still pleasurable. I'm sure that is the case with most circumcised men, hence the inability to get all that worked up over this. The problem is that it is an entirely unnecessary, quite barbaric act being forced onto an infant, and it does reduce pleasure and possibly cause complications later. When you remove a foreskin, you're removing a lot of nerves with it, you're leaving the glans of the penis exposed and keratinized, and you're losing the sensation of the foreskin rubbing against the glans during the act. Men who are circumcised are more likely to have problems with premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction, and the circumcision can sometimes go very wrong and really hurt the boy... and all of this for what? Why? It can all be avoided by simply not circumcising boys anymore.  I know if I ask you right now if you really wouldn't rather feel more pleasure, you're going to say you're indifferent, and that's fine. Neither of us will ever know what we're really missing out on, however, and that bothers me.

I just want to point out two things.   I'm not damaged.    You not being damaged and you not feeling damaged are two different things. Surgery causes damage, end of. We could argue about whether the damage is greater or lesser than x arbitrary line you've drawn in the sand, but I won't waste our time. I simply want to point out you've masqueraded one argument as another. To be specific, you've inserted the argument that you don't feel like you've been physically damaged as a support for the argument that therefore you aren't. You go on to make that specific argument in the next line.    I think it's tough because the rhetoric doesn't match my experience or the experiences of anyone else I've spoken to about it.   Emphasis my own.    I hear and sympathize with those who feel damaged, but I don't empathize with them. I just don't get the passion.   You don't get the passion because you don't truly understand the (our) position. That's not to say you would empathize, but rather you simply are incapable of empathizing due to a lack of understanding. People like me who are passionate about the subject understand exactly what was lost. I know both functionally and physically what the difference is, because I've experienced it for myself, with my own flesh.   So there you go. Your entire position demystified. You don't empathize because you don't actually understand, and you don't understand because it doesn't match your life experience. Your experience (and everyone you've talked to's) being mono-dimensional means that there really is no other logical position for you to take (and I get that, it's entirely reasonable). It's like saying in my experience the sky is always blue therefore space is blue too. It's not wrong, but doesn't address any of the issues with such a line of reasoning.   The only way you might ever come to understand us (if you actually care to) is if you do one of two things.  You can either;   Expand your experience so that you know the difference (this is obviously the more difficult of the two, considering foreskin restoration takes years to complete, not that you'd need to complete it to be convinced mind you) or,  You can stop referring to your personal experience as a platform to build your position (since literally the only experience you have is incapable of giving insight into the greater picture by virtue of that experience) and instead take to the body of available empirical study to formulate your position.    The point isn't to tell you your experience is wrong (it isn't), but rather to point out the extreme limitations of utilizing such a method to decide on a topic like this. Just something to think about."

It's not that your experience is not valid. It absolutely is valid (just as everyone's personal experience is valid, we don't have any option but to live our own experiences). It's that your subjective experience isn't relevant to the arguments you're making with it.   You're using your experience being circumcised, to infer and deduce conclusions about the differences between being circumcised and being intact. More specifically, you're using your lack of adverse or immediately obvious problems as a result of your circumcision, as evidence that you haven't suffered any kind of damage, and thus haven't lost any appreciable sexual function. This isn't an appropriate or logically sound application of your experience, as your experience is not capable of covering the other 1/2 of the supposition you're making (that because you feel fine there is no difference, or no appreciable difference). This is due to the fact that being circumcised doesn't actually tell you anything about being intact or the intact sexual experience.  You can certainly use it as a starting point to begin formulating the argument you're making, but my point is it doesn't actually provide any real evidence for that argument. It simply provides personal references and context for why you feel that way.

I might be just another internet stranger, but make no mistake, I despise being circumcised, for reasons aesthetic, functional and as a matter of principle.

The foreskin protects the glans (head), and without it, the head develops a keratin skin which makes it less sensitive; the foreskin also allows a gliding motion, and without it, can cause the penis to sink back into the abdomen or otherwise curve when it would not.  The foreskin is sold for major profits in the cosmetic industry.  People have compared sex with a circumcised and uncircumcised  penis as black-and-white vs. color."

TrueReddit,3cxq46,wmcscrooge,3,Mon Jul 13 01:55:19 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make sense.  Under that logic, if someone removed an arm at birth and you felt no pain, you wouldn't have been mutilated. If you lived in a culture where removing arms (or ears, noses, etc). was expected, then you would not regret anything.  You're twisting words. Furthermore, your argument was no disadvantage. Several disadvantages were stated; you then moved the goalposts. Are you emotionally attached, do you have an agenda, or can you just not reason logically?"

I wouldn't be able to do things like pullups or eat with both hands or properly hug someone. and you might have valid disadvantages but by my first comment i meant that personally (and i would say other people i know who are circumcised (a lot)) don't have regrets about being circumsized. Sure there may be disadvantages but we don't see them as huge and i didn't notice a disadvantage so that i would see it as mutilation.   it comes down to the fact that i agree with the poster above that no one i know in real life actually cares about circumcision and sees it as a bad thing. it's just a thing that happens. i could care less about being circumcised."

TrueReddit,3cs8aa,hooligan333,31,Fri Jul 10 15:28:46 2015 UTC,Ketamine can be quite lethal.  I use it in my profession to intubate children in emergencies. At easily achievable leveks it greatky interferes with breathing. Im not talking about a bump you do at a show or a bar but  if you have the more more and more situation going on and you like ketamine at the show and think you could do a little bit more at home for fun - well it might be the last party drug you ever do  especially when mixed with other drugs like opiates and alcohol.
TrueReddit,3cs8aa,Malodourous,23,Fri Jul 10 15:40:14 2015 UTC,"I always thought ketamine was used in battlefield medicine and with children specifically because it doesn't suppress breathing the same way other anesthetics do.   Ketamine causes a dissociative state, so that people are unaware of what is happening to them, but they retain the vital cough and gag reflexes. In caesarean sections, women can die when the acid accumulating in their stomach runs up the oesophagus and then enters the lungs because that reflex has been knocked out by anaesthetic."
TrueReddit,3cs8aa,al_eberia,19,Fri Jul 10 16:29:42 2015 UTC,"You are right, it doesn't surpress breathing the way other anesthetics do in fact it actually makes ventilation, that is the active filling up the lungs, easier and better but at high enough doses breathing frequency typically decreases for initial few minutes after administration of ketamine. Apnea, however, can occur if the drug is administered rapidly IV or in excess dose or an opioid or other cns depressant is included in the preoperative medication or recreationally.    There is high incidence of arterial desaturation observed immediately after induction of anaesthesia with intravenous ketamine however relieved with oxygen supplementation for initial 10-15 minutes in contrast to volatile anaesthetic agents, ketamine anaesthesia has a sparing effect on intercostal muscle activity, which may explain the maintenance of functional residual capacity.      15  minutes of desaturation of PaO2 is not for everyone. It might not kill you but it's not a good time either.    Often unattended desaturation results in hypoxia that is mediated by the greater residual 02 available and results in a low rate of respiration with slow building hypoxia.  i'm just a nurse so maybe a anesthesiologist could chime in on this ketamine situation."
TrueReddit,3cs8aa,Malodourous,11,Fri Jul 10 17:40:04 2015 UTC,"i'm curious why you're curious - but if you really want to know I was trying to reword that last bit about PaO2 and arterial saturation in a way that might be better to demonstrate to someone who doesn't understand how oxygen and CO2 in the blood work together to drive the  ""demand""  for another breath. But it wasn't working out. It was getting more convoluted instead of more clear."
TrueReddit,3cs8aa,Malodourous,14,Fri Jul 10 17:52:35 2015 UTC,"Well certainly the risk factor is much higher when mixing substances. But the LD50 of ketamine alone is quite high (229+/- 5mg in adult rats (Goldenthal EI. ""A compilation of LD50 values in newborn and adult animals"". Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1971 Jan 30;18(1):185-207.))   and fatalities caused solely by Ketamine overdose are comparatively rare. (""While reports of ketamine abuse are increasing, reports of ketamine deaths and tissue concentrations associated with fatalities are rare."" (Moore KA, Kilbane EM, Jones R, Kunsman GW, Levine B, Smith M. ""Tissue distribution of ketamine in a mixed drug fatality"". J Forensic Sci. 1997 Nov 08;42(6):1183-5.))   Perhaps in your case it is a matter of children being more strongly affected?"
TrueReddit,3cs8aa,hooligan333,3,Fri Jul 10 18:42:31 2015 UTC,I think what happens is it's the side effects of the arterial desaturation rather than the actual toxicity of a dose. What happens is there's a level of  complacency that  that comes about because how effective the drug is that that 10 to 15 minute window afterwards needs to be monitored very closely.

However, the role of KD in refractory status epilepticus (RSE) has not been well described. The aim of this study is to explore the role of KD in patients with RSE. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of four children and one adult with RSE between October 2006 and August 2010. All presented with status epilepticus (SE) that was presumed to be associated with viral encephalitis. After we failed to control the seizures with standard measures for SE, we tried KD. The overall seizure frequency decreased to <50% of baseline in median eight (1–19) days. At one month of KD, two patients were seizure-free, one patient showed >90% seizure reduction, and the others had >75% decrease without generalized seizures. With improvement in the RSE, we were able to taper the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and wean patients from prolonged mechanical ventilation. The adverse events of KD in RSE included aspiration pneumonia, gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, and hypertriglyceridemia. Those results demonstrate that KD can be a valuable therapeutic option for patients with RSE."

This was a ~20,000 participant study of mostly white, middle class, college educated. Other studies found low rates of continued heroin use among returning US soldiers. I'm sure some people develop dependencies after pain medication use or heavy party lives, but it's the statistics that tell the story, at least correlatively."

What were the metrics they used to rank people on the scale? Was there a normalized population set? Was it self evaluated? We're evaluations only given to people who already had drug dependence?   These things are very relevant, and if r/science has taught me anything it's that you can't trust claims from a study until you've rigorously reviewed it yourself."

TrueReddit,3cs8aa,adrenalineadrenaline,4,Fri Jul 10 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"Like the other guy said, some people just like to get messed up.   That's kind of a simple statement, like ""sometimes it rains."" Ok, that's great, but what are you going to DO about it?   The dude you're responding to is talking about treating the people with problems instead of attacking the supply. You say you agree with that sentiment. You don't cure a bunch of people of alcoholism by shutting down the local bars and pouring all the alcohol in stores down the drain. In fact, you might literally kill some alcoholics because withdrawal is nothing to fuck with. The fact that drug smuggling into prisons is basically a business in itself shows that we have seriously misplaced our priorities.   What about those college drunks? What about pain killers, amphetamines? What about them? At a certain point people become adults and you can't just punish them for behavior which is only hazardous to themselves. Cigarettes and alcohol kill a ghastly number of people per year, but since people die slowly of disease and not in a violent outburst, it is just accepted. Is it sad? Yea, but what do you propose we do?  If someone does something malicious or irresponsibly puts others in danger, they should be punished. If they were on a drug while committing a crime, it doesn't change the fact that the crime is wrong and shouldn't be done by anyone, under any influence. Taking a drug should not be a crime. If you are going to overdose or use a drug you don't understand or are inexperienced with, that may lead to irresponsible behavior. ALL THE MORE REASON to make drugs legal, regulated, and have their effects/side-effects clearly researched and available for the buyer, so if they do something wrong, it is very clear that the responsibility lies with them."
TrueReddit,3cs8aa,or_some_shit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:56:53 2015 UTC,"So you're proposing that not only should all drugs be legalized, but then we should enforce punishment under the influence the same as if they were sober? We don't even do that with drugs that are currently legal.   You say I'm not proposing any solutions (Which I didn't intend to), but you propose something that's completely unrealistic. I think your solution is just appealing to an idealized simplification of drugs."
TrueReddit,3cs8aa,adrenalineadrenaline,3,Fri Jul 10 17:55:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks to whoever downvoted me, for the record I'm upvoting you for visibility. And yes I am interested in solutions, you don't have to try to propose one, but it would be nice, and it would add something to the conversation.   Yes drugs should be legalized, and equal crimes should get equal punishments. Negligently hitting people with your car while sober should entail some punishment. Negligently hitting people with your car while drunk should get the same punishment PLUS the punishment you would get for driving drunk. That is, drinking yourself to the point of intoxication and driving a vehicle is dangerously irresponsible. Driving drunk is still a crime even if you don't hit anyone, as it should be. You therefore are no longer just a hazard to your own health by ingesting any given drug, but to those around you, and that is where my distinction is.   It is also an idealized simplification to put the blame on illicit street drugs when they are unregulated and notoriously cut/contaminated with other chemicals. Are the people that buy and take these drugs still responsible for their actions even though they didn't necessarily know the impurities in the substance they were taking, and therefore couldn't  anticipate the effect they would have? Yes, they are still responsible for any criminal activity - I just don't think taking the drug itself is a criminal activity.   Now, if we pretend that everything else was equal: in a world where a certain percentage of people are going to use drugs whether we like it or not, I think it is safer to give those people an avenue to take drugs that are pure, dosed correctly, regulated, and not contributing to the black market. I would prefer to have secluded centers (modern opium dens) where people could go and get their fix (and hopefully encourage them into treatment) instead of shuffling them in and out of prison and then just letting them loose on the street."
TrueReddit,3cs8aa,are_you_seriously,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:10:29 2015 UTC,"Well my solution would be too nuanced to write here. For example, I wouldn't legalize all drugs. Things like heroin or meth are too devastating to ever think they could be used safely. In order to go into the detail necessary I'd expect to do a lot more research and spend months/years developing and redeveloping intelligent systems.   Things aren't black and white. Legalizing all drugs would solve problems, but it would also cause new problems."

Maybe while they got high and partied their grades dropped, or they kept doing something stupid. Maybe after graduating they realized how they fucked up and didn't want to accept it.

I've never known anyone who had escalated to taking it nonstop, IV, or at huge doses.  I would guess it's a comparable percentage to people who drink vs. people who become alcoholics.  It's a fun escape, no hangover and generally pretty cheap.  The damage to organs and such doesn't happen with rare and small doses.

This is the second collaboration of Evans and Uwais after their first action film, Merantau, released in 2009. Both films showcase the traditional Indonesian martial art Pencak Silat, with fight choreography by Uwais and Yayan Ruhian, who also worked on Merantau. The U.S. release of the film features music by Mike Shinoda and Joseph Trapanese.  After its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), The Raid received positive reviews from critics.    The name of the film was changed to The Raid: Redemption in the United States because the distributor company Sony Pictures Classics could not secure the rights to the title; this also allowed Evans to plan out future titles in the series.   It was released in the United States on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on 14 August 2012.   A sequel, The Raid 2 (known as The Raid 2: Berandal in Indonesia), was released in 2014 to positive reviews; winning even more awards. Another sequel, The Raid 3, is planned for release in 2018 or 2019.

Recreational doses are 15-150mg for 95% of users that I've encountered. Very few people go above this looking for a high, because it pretty much knocks you out. It doesn't build tolerance quickly like opiates, so you have to work pretty hard at it to get to a point where you can stay conscious on a higher dose than that.

This combined with a greater level of family privacy makes for better starting point perhaps. Certainly superior to tent/tarp structures so often found in refugee camps.   Excellent submission."

The comparison with the 'tough on crime' crackdown of the 1970's is a good one.   If these kind of laws pass cops will use it to trick working class people into going to jail.   Upper middle people will likely be less affected as their expensive laywers will coach them on the right thing to say.  Even rapists will lie in the 'new speech' and not get caught out.

The right, believing that people are fallen creatures and only strong institutions make people good, such as the fear of god, fear of the police etc  Carceral feminism falls into this right wing camp, and sees men as wicked fallen rapists who can be deterred from this and maybe pointed in the right direction by law and order and tough prison sentences.

TrueReddit,3ctmqz,knoxxx_harrington,8,Sat Jul 11 02:31:44 2015 UTC,"I think what's really going on is an attempt to outlaw casual sex. Here's a post I wrote about this on another sub:    I feel like it's really a war against casual sex.   There was another story here, http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/story-of-teen-s-sex-offense-sentence-spreads/article_5abea3ce-c09f-51c6-a1fe-c706efccc512.html, where the judge calls casual sex ""totally inappropriate behavior.""    “You went online, to use a fisherman’s expression, trolling for women to meet and have sex with,” Wiley lectured Zach. “That seems to be part of our culture now: meet, hook up, have sex, sayonara. Totally inappropriate behavior.”   The reason I say this is because casual sex is something that almost always happens in the heat of the moment. A woman needs to be seduced and she probably needs to be drunk and/or high. Men as well. Very few people have casual sex sober. It is something many people regret afterward. Any consent given is in the heat of lust, under influence, and within the context of having a good time, partying, in other words. Casual sex is an ephemeral act, one that comes from equally ephemeral feelings. Many people, men and women, will look back at any casual sex act and have trouble remembering why they did it in the first place.   There is a small minority of people, men and women, who do enjoy casual sex near 100% of the time. As is obvious, however, it's not easy for these people to find each other. Nor is it easy for people to figure out if they're one of these people even after a few times of trying.   Is it possible that these new laws surrounding consent are a backdoor way to outlaw casual sex? The above judge has essentially said this.   Science is showing that morality comes not from logic and analysis of data, but from deep-seated subconscious and primitive drives. Maybe AIDS killed off all the casual sex lovers? Maybe they all stopped having kids thanks to the pill and abortion?   Whatever the case, I'm glad I was able to be young for that brief moment in modern history where casual sex was all right.   I think the law currently makes casual sex impossible. No matter how someone acts in the moment, all that matters is what they say the next day. If both parties are drunk, it's still up to the man to control himself    Duke dean Sue Wasiolek testified that in cases where both parties are drunk, “assuming it is a male and female, it is the responsibility in the case of the male to gain consent before proceeding with sex.”   http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2015/02/drunk_sex_on_campus_universities_are_struggling_to_determine_when_intoxicated.single.html  Legally, casual sex is near impossible in the current climate. It's de facto outlawed.   I guess when you have a sexual revolution, paradoxically, it's the prudes who do most of the reproducing."

The whole point is to make the whole process so risky and awkward that the undesirable men don't even try.   No, the point is to provide legal protection to people who are the victim of sexual assault.  No law prevents unattractive people from going to a bar or a party or a grocery store or where ever else you want to go to look for a partner for casual sex. Whether or not you can find one is a different story.   That way women have exactly what they want.   Yeah, a way to legally prosecute people who sexually assault them.

TrueReddit,3ctmqz,hashbrohash,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:08:20 2015 UTC,"I think it is just one more way to disempower unattractive men. Having to ask makes the process more difficult to negotiate. If you're already attractive and confident then of course you can pull it off, but we're talking about marginal situations where the person may or may not be ok with kissing you and if you ask then you will show even more of a lack of confidence than you already have, and the person is almost guaranteed to say no. But if you just go in for it then you might thereby appear more confident than you are, or the person might just be willing to tolerate it. That's the theory, anyway. I'm working with what I have here. The enthusiastic Yes! Yes! Yes! is not something I'm going to be hearing in this lifetime. The fear of getting slapped or yelled at is one thing, the fear of being arrested just takes it to a whole other level and makes it so I'm afraid to even talk to people even if I don't really think it will happen to me as a consequence of this particular interaction."

TrueReddit,3ctmqz,thewilsonline,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:34:22 2015 UTC,"The problem here with regards to rape and the law is simply the most clearly visible example of the fundamental contradiction of the idea of Law itself.  Consider the origin of a law under ideal circumstances:    There is a general sense within a society (actually within the ruling class of a society but I'll try to keep this simple) that certain specific activities which have been carried out are undesirable to such an extent that they should be prohibited in the future. Certain characteristics of these undesired activities are abstracted from their historical examples in order to form a general prohibition of similar future action.   So the law is granted its social authority by a loose, ambiguous reaction against certain specific historical acts, but can only be applied according to a generalized, black/white theory of those acts.   Now, each new act carried out within a society is essentially unique, with a unique social meaning according to the context in which it was performed. However, in order for an act to be placed within the categories of legal or illegal everything which makes that act unique must be treated as if it were irrelevant, so that the act can be viewed as essentially a new exemplar of certain generalized forms of acts which have been made legal or illegal.  The problem is that stripping away the unique context of an act has the effect of changing the social meaning of that act. So that the society is inclined to understand the act according to one sense, but is compelled to treat it under the law according to a different sense. So that any law is necessarily inadequate to answer the social authority which gives it power.  We see this directly in the case of rape when confronted with the essential impossibility of capturing our social understanding of what constitutes rape with a general conception which could be formulated in legal terms to include exactly those acts which are rape and exclude exactly those acts which are not. The case of rape is even further complicated because we as a society do not even have a general shared implicit understanding of rape upon which to base a generalized abstraction of its form.  The reason we make laws despite the trouble they cause is due to the social inequalities which make us wary of the discrimination likely to occur if judgement about the permissibility of actions was carried out on a genuinely case-by-case basis. But in fact the notion of Law only conceals the basic act of judgement (hiding it in the form that the generalized prohibition is made to take via the wording of the law), allowing the state to appear to be acting with divine objectivity when it is in fact a tool for the ruling class to enforce its own will upon society as a whole."

TrueReddit,3ctvh9,heisgone,4,Sun Jul 12 01:42:41 2015 UTC,"I think there is another way to look at the austerity measures Greece as been asked to put in place. Greece needed to get its act together. They needed to solved their fiscal evasion issue, the retirement age and pension were out of touch with their capacity to pay, and so on. It's near impossible for other countries to check for those things or not even appropriate to ask such change. The austerity measures force Greece to balance its sheet and be reasonable. In other words, Greeks needed to feel the pain to realize how terrible their situation is.

While Greece did get themselves into their current situation initially, the action of other countries have only continued to make matters worse.   It's especially hard for a country like Greece to climb out of a recession if they can't take certain anti recession measures like printing more currency or keeping inflation low (like Krugman mentioned). Perhaps it's an inherent flaw in the concept of the Euro, that Greece isn't allowed attempts to mitigate these problems on their own.   While I do sympathize with other countries right to be frustrated with Greece, it's important to remember history in which deep recessions caused extremists to take political power and start pro war agendas."

So it's not as if Greece has continued to get away with outlandish spending. They've already cut pension funding by 13% along with other rollbacks. At a certain point, you can only cut so much spending without looking at other reasons why the economy is failing. Creating jobs through some sort of stimulus could have been of a start. If lower income to middle class people can buy goods than the economy would have a better chance of improving overall. 25% unemployment is just not going to cut it. You have to look at some way of lowering that number.   Greece will not invade Europe right now, no, but it doesn't set a good precedent for how to treat countries that are going through depression."

We still believe gold and diamonds have real value.    America is rich because it has a healthy well educated population, a lot of land that can produce more than enough food and more than enough houses and vehicles to keep its economic engines running. America is not Greece because America is buffered from the rapaciousness of international finance because if America dies international finance dies.    When Americans don't pay their debts international financial institutions die when Greeks cant pay their debts Greece's 21st century economy dies. It is the old story. If you owe the bank a million dollars and can't pay you are in trouble but if you owe the bank a few billion dollars and can't pay the bank is in trouble.    International finance cares nothing about Greeks and their hardships. What we are about to witness is what type of punishment international finance can inflict upon Greece to make sure the other Greeces out there don't vote for freedom and democracy. The great fear we have is not that Greece will fail but that Greece and its people will succeed in their new economy."

The very smart child born in Somalia will definitely end up worse than the mediocre child in Belgium. In the story, the child with genes that predispose him to being calm and rational ends up worse when raised in poverty than the child (Carlos) with genes that make him a kind of sultry person with a lot of opportunities.  To people like Pinker (who I like!) a person is pretty much his genes. I agree that a huge majority of the traits that people would use to describe you or me (light-hearted, a loner, loves dancing, etc etc) are genetic. But we would think of Hitler the failed painter as a really different guy than the Hitler we all know and love despise. Even though contemporaries would probably describe them with the same attributes."

TrueReddit,3cq819,Early_Deuce,26,Sat Jul 11 01:01:24 2015 UTC,"The pairings in this are so interesting. There's the obvious one:   Jorge-Carlos, and William-Wilber. Raised together as brothers, but genetically unrelated. Jorge-William, and Carlos-Wilber. Genetic twins, but raised in different environments.   But then, there are other connections, too:   Carlos and William were both raised in a family that distinctly wasn't like them. They're outsiders. William was poor, and it seemed like achieving anything beyond his family origins hard. He's jealous of Carlos, because Carlos had the same feeling, but because his family had money, it was easy for him to make his own life. Carlos, meanwhile, is kind of bitter and cynical, but not because his life was hard. And he doesn't really seem to know why he feels that way. Jorge and Wilber were raised whole, with their genetic families, just with an extra (unrelated) brother in their household. These two seem to have be the most confident, easygoing, happiest. They didn't have anything to escape.   Carlos is also different in one other way: Jorge & William's genetic mother is dead, so only Carlos has to forge a new relationship with his genetic, ""new"" parents, Ana and Carmelo.  He doesn't get to reconcile his two mothers. There was one, who is now gone, and now there's a new one he never knew about. There may be some internal conflict going on about whether he's ""replacing"" the mother and parents that raised him. For the other three brothers, it's not nearly this complicated: William never met his genetic mother, Jorge's connection with Ana is more like meeting a close friend's mom, and Wilber didn't even meet or have much of a connection with the deceased, unrelated mother."

TrueReddit,3cq819,aenea,3,Fri Jul 10 13:41:23 2015 UTC,"When my kids were born there were 3 sets of twins and my triplets in the NICU.  It was kind of a running joke among us that someone might take home the wrong kids.  Especially when they're preemies and don't really look like babies yet, I can see how mix-ups could happen.  And security in hospitals 20 years ago wasn't what it is now.   But I can't even imagine how I'd react if it had actually happened. My kids are all fraternal, but the girls look identical, and their brother looks like he's from a completely different family (he's not).   I'm just to the jokes about where he came from.  I don't think that I'd freak out over finding out that I'd raised 'someone else's child'- I'm adopted, and I think that a lot more than genetics goes into making a family.  But finding out that I'd missed out on my child's lifetime would be so horrendously difficult.  In this case it seems like everyone ended up with good parents, but that's not always the case.   I do often question the 'twin bond' stuff that I've seen.  I think that a lot of people romanticize the multiples bond, and I don't think that it's always as strong as a lot of people assume it is.  My kids are very close (even with having special needs), and occasionally startle me with how much they think about each other, but that can also be true of best friends, siblings, very close siblings etc.  I've done multiple birth support work for almost 20 years now, and it's also very common for multiples to resent each other, to go out of their way to separate themselves from their birth siblings, to resent their parents, or just not like their siblings very much.   Genetics really isn't everything.   I do think that 'separated at birth' twin studies are tremendously interesting, but it seems that often the people involved are being interviewed by press more than by scientists, and there's not always good information given.  Leading questions, a lack of presentation of 'differences', etc.  Researchers see what they want to see, but I still think that the studies are worthwhile.  In many ways twin studies (especially separated at birth) do at least give us a different perspective on the nature/nurture debate.  There's been such a switch in the last few decades from looking at environment to looking at genetics, and cases like this certainly are interesting."

And I suspect terror predates Islam such as the Sicarii Zealots (Jewish) of the first century AD. So obviously the West is not to blame for terrorism as a tactic of political change.  In terms of the modern Islamic terror, that began as an intellectual movement in Egypt in the 1950s post WWII as a means of preventing Western ideas and institutions from taking over Islamic countries. They saw it as a global clash of cultures and Islam was fighting for its life. The West did not start that fight directly, though there was a long history of Western colonialism that was pretty ugly. However it didn't have to go that way, see India for example where ugly Western colonialism came to a peaceful end. You don't see many Hindus wanting to kill Brits.

Maintaining this view devalues the mods and also devalues folks like Victoria who performed a lot of mod-like duties.
TrueReddit,3cyn82,curien,2,Sun Jul 12 00:07:21 2015 UTC,"Well the theory is that the mods are an organic extension of the community, and that a certain group of the community will always be drawn to the mod position and replace any mods that leave.  So basically, the mods are part of the community and one of the main reasons that the community is self sustaining.   The thinking goes that people will always want to be mods so there will always be mods to manage the community.  I don't know how true this is.  Obviously you have to provide an inviting environment for the mods (which reddit has not done a stellar job at) or nobody will want the job.  If they make the job of mod too unappealing the system breaks down.  But on the flip side, I think all the mods on reddit might not appreciate how replaceable they are on an individual level.  Sure, if they collaborate across the site they can do a great deal of immediate damage, as we saw recently.  But I've been in various internet discussion communities for a long time, and people really REALLY want to be mods.  If all the mods on a default sub quit en mass, I bet the sub could be close to back to normal within a few days.  There would be hundreds of people clamoring to replace them, there always are.  This is what they mean by self sustaining - the community is run by the community, so even if the people keeping it going quit the community will supply more.  I'll also note that the importance of mods for stuff beyond spam removal is debatable - the upvote system works pretty well on its own.  Sure, you definitely need them for niche subs like askhistorians, but this subreddit is very lightly moderated and functions well.  A huge sub - leagueoflegends - had a moderator free week recently, where the mods did the bare minimum to keep the sub from being banned.  It really didn't make much of a difference.  The mods work hard and do a pretty thankless job.  I would never want to do it.  But they're more replaceable than you might think - for reasons I can't understand people line up to moderate large sites for free."

They will compare these inputs from a large dataset to the desired output variable, and then calculate the ""appropriate"" bias to fit.  They make statistical judgments on populations. On an individual basis the decisions can be cruel and ridiculous, but in aggregate, they meet a certain threshold of performance. If the only reward is for a true positive (algorithm true, real world true), then there's no surprise we get discriminatory outcomes like a false positive (algorithm true, real world false) or a false negative (algorithm false, real world true).  For instance, I want to find criminals. My algorithm checks if you listen to rap music, and if you're black. This algorithm will produce a subset of the population with higher crime rates than the general population. It's successful! Yay, pay me a million dollars. The only problem is that it finds a ton of people who aren't criminals, and misses a huge amount of other criminals. It's hideously discriminatory. But if the only requirement is that my subpopulation has more criminals than the general population... I'm ""successful"".  This is what these algorithms do. The issue is then how much influence and how much human intervention is required when applying these population measurements to individuals, and how to weight false negatives and positives when the only real reward is true positives."

The algorithms have biases intentionally built into them as prescribed by the advertisers paying for the ad. Obviously there may be other unintentional biases, but the aren't the study results mostly worthless(""the ad was shown to X population more times than Y population"")?"

I intended to discriminate based on those factors, I didn't intend to get 95% white males age 45+.  I can see why a study would think that it is noteworthy that filtering a population by traits a,b,c results in a group with trait x, but I don't see how they jump from that to either thinking the algorithm cares about age/race or that I care about anything other than if my boat gets sold."

In this case, the program's obligation is to reduce the general population to a set of people with traits x and y and show those people the customers ad.

Do women and men on average have the same experience, educational attainment, performance reviews and intangible assets for the 200K+ jobs in question?  Maybe.

If men are more likely to accept higher paying jobs because social pressure push women away from those jobs and/or make employers more likely to accept men for those jobs, then, yes, that sounds like a bad thing. Is this sort of targeted advertising reinforcing social phenomena that are unjustly pushing women away from these jobs?   Also, you claim it has to reflect prejudice when a disproportionate number of convicted criminals come from certain ethic groups.   Both the terms ""convicted"" and ""criminals"" are worth investigating here. Could there be biases in convictions? Is it possible that laws are designed to discriminate?

But here's the article's thesis statement:   As the American mission faltered, U.S. officials repeatedly trumpeted impressive statistics — the number of schools built, girls enrolled, textbooks distributed, teachers trained, and dollars spent — to help justify the 13 years and more than 2,000 Americans killed since the United States invaded.   It's unclear to me at what point in either the Bush or Obama administrations the ""education"" bit was ever proffered as the decisive rationale for continuing US involvement.   There's lots of research here about corruption, inefficiency, and waste. But I see little to support the author's inference that the purported education success was as ""justification"" for the war. The Afghan war has cost about a trillion dollars. As the article concludes, much more humbly:   Since 2002, the United States has invested more than $1 billion to provide education to Afghan children. But the American government does not know how many schools it has built, how many Afghan students are actually attending school, or how many teachers are actually teaching. What’s certain is the numbers for all of those are far less than what it has been peddling.   If education were such a primary goal, surely we'd have spent more than .1% of the cost on it."
TrueReddit,3cocfs,Plowbeast,7,Thu Jul 9 16:09:54 2015 UTC,"Also the education thing was because we realized after WWI and the American Civil War that if we don't help to rebuild the society after you effectively destroy it and it's infrastructure after a war, the values and ideals never really change and just goes to fuel the bitterness that may eventually lead to the next war or divide. The reason we invested in education was to break people out of the medieval mindset that allows the Taliban to exist and to some extent introduce new political values. So we're not dealing with the Taliban 2.0 or a Afghanistan version of Nazi Germany in 20 years."
TrueReddit,3cocfs,Schlagv,5,Thu Jul 9 20:43:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But see Rumsfeld Doctrine, which doesn't clearly match up with this thinking."
TrueReddit,3cocfs,Oafus,17,Thu Jul 9 20:47:48 2015 UTC,"If education were such a primary goal, surely we'd have spent more than .1% of the cost on it.   No one (accept defenders of the Bush administration) would say it was really a goal. The whole point is that despite what was said, only 0.1% was actually spent on it.  I would not at all say schools in Afghanistan were the reason the US gave for invading, that's ridiculous, but it was definitely among the rationals. The administration built a case for why we needed not just to catch Bin Ladin or depose the Taliban, but that we were going to Afghanistan to solve much broader problems. From GWB's September 20th 2001 speech:   Afghanistan's people have been brutalized -- many are starving and many have fled. Women are not allowed to attend school. You can be jailed for owning a television. Religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate. A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not long enough.   And from the introduction of his 2002 state of the union address:   The last time we met in this chamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to school. Today women are free, and are part of Afghanistan's new government. And we welcome the new Minister of Women's Affairs, Doctor Sima Samar. (Applause.)   Anecdotally, having argued a great deal at the time about this, the whole social side, of actually helping the Afghan people, was a compelling argument, everyone was talking about the plight of those girls or the public executions at football stadiums. It explained why were actually sending so many troops and money to Afghanistan, rather than just dropping some bombs and going after Bin Laden.   Obviously it's silly to act like we went there just to fix the schools, but it's also pretty clear that the schools really were part of a larger argument given for why were going there."
TrueReddit,3cocfs,flamehead2k1,6,Thu Jul 9 16:30:21 2015 UTC,"I hear you that there was a bit of post-hoc discussion of schools. But even there (as in the passages you cite), it was primarily about gender inequality. I remember vividly the coverage of the Taliban from the pre-9/11 media--it was a progressive (Wilsonian) idea to invade Afghanistan and/or take down the Taliban on the basis of their mistreatment of women and destruction of cultural heritage. (That the left was outraged by the the Taliban prior to the 9/11 attacks made it all the more easy to ensure near universal approval of the beginning of that war.)"
TrueReddit,3cocfs,kraken9911,2,Thu Jul 9 16:59:47 2015 UTC,"They were trying to justify the war by showing improvements in the area. Even if they are just over there slaughtering 'bad guys', you can't justify a 12 years war on that alone as we clearly have no threat from them in the US, there has already been a lot of opposition and pressure to withdraw. You have to show you are improving the area. No one is saying this was the justification, it was one of many, but this one was a lie and so worth writing about."

TrueReddit,3cocfs,qqzqq,0,Fri Jul 10 02:14:08 2015 UTC,"The true story is that Al Quaida was made of a few dozen people and a dew hundred students.  After 9/11, the student left and the permanent members ran and remained hidden.  Special forces from Western nations were unable to find even a single member of Al Quaida ...  The US was massively humiliated and the administration couldn't tell the people how deep the failure was.  They invented the media scam of the Tora Bora fortress, a James Bond like fortress with super computers, chemical and bacteriologic labs and other crazy things.  But they still had nothing to show. So they removed the taliban from power. Yes, the talibans were batshit insane religious fondamentalists, they were chosen by the US to be reckless against atheist USSR.  But talibans had very little to do with Al Quaida. They just let them have their training camps in the countryside.  The whole invasion is a desaster. The more you read about it, the more you understand how crazy the whole thing was. In a massively tribal society, the US bombed the dominant tribes and put in power a banana President from the weakest tribe ""to avoid favoritism"". The result was a united front by the strong tribes to fight the US and take back their power. The government has not a single chance to survive without Western support.  The talibans are not a threat to the West. They just want power money and women. They just want to rule their land and abuse the masses, Afganistan is to weak to be interested in global politics. They have nothing to do with international terrorism, which is a Saudi policy. Taliban ""terrorism"" is what in WWII was called resistance and sabotage against the invader and punitive operations against traitors and collabos."

TrueReddit,3cocfs,robboywonder,3,Thu Jul 9 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"This has actually been going on for a while. You'll notice that most of many other ""click bait-y"" websites (for lack of a better term), except for maybe like the Huffington Post, have had relatively brief life cycles: Upworthy, ViralNova, Buzzteam, etc. all had meteoric rises, but when's the last time you saw any of them shared on your social media feed?  Buzzfeed has been willing to invest in talent to build the organization long term. You see some of the other second- or third-generation internet native media companies (Vox, Medium, etc) putting out really good stuff, but I can't think of any that try to invest in both high brow stuff and low brow stuff like Buzzfeed. Maybe HuffPo and some of the Gawker properties, but they're generally seen as more middle brow, I guess. My friend is an editor at Buzzfeed and she was hired from Boston.com (the Boston Globe's web portal). Buzzfeed has always had particularly high quality foreign coverage and long form reporting (which few people read, relatively, but they continue to invest in). I forget where their long form editor was before, but Miriam Elder, the foreign editor, was hired straight from the Guardian. And she was picked up back in 2013, so this isn't a recent change but part of a long term policy. Other stand-outs include Anne Helen Peterson, who has a PhD in communications from UT-Austin and decided to work at Buzzfeed over working in academia. She writes intelligently about celebrities, tabloids, and gossip--not subjects that intrinsically interests me, but she puts them all in social and historical contexts that makes all of the longer pieces she writes must-reads for me. Fewer people have interest in that sort of stuff than Ariana Grande licking donuts, but I think Buzzfeed deserves tremendous credit for really investing in people like Miriam Elder and Anne Helen Peterson and things like their foreign and long form pieces."

I don't believe we ever really argued for education in the Afghan war, but after about 2004 when we'd really blown capturing Bin Laden and it was clear we weren't able to effectively provide security there as casualty numbers went up I do remember a sort of ""rationale of the week"" approach.  It seemed more driven by the news cycle.  If a school got blown up it was about education, if a woman had acid thrown in her face it was about gender rights, if a farmer was forced to grow opium then it was sort of about the drug trade.  I checked google trends and while it in no way confirms my impressions, you do see a kind of jump in the mentions of education in 2004 and then a big dive and after a while a sort of cycle of peaks and plateaus.  https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=education%20Afghanistan"

TrueReddit,3cocfs,iwentoutsideonce,3,Fri Jul 10 00:06:53 2015 UTC,"I can't really speak to the larger education effort in Afghanistan other than what I've read in the USAID SIGAR reports however I can speak as a lower level enlisted member of LT DeNenno's unit who was there when the school was built.   First off, we were an Infantry Unit.  Our primary mission was to find and destroy the taliban insurgency in our area and ensure security of our area.  We were not trained humanitarians.  We fought a lot.  The fact that the school was created in the first place was a miracle, the article's author understates the combat situation on the ground there at the time.  While that school was under construction we were engaged in combat multiple times a week.  LT DeNenno was also tasked with intelligence as well as his primary job as Fire Support Officer, he created the school in the additional time that he had in addition to regular combat patrols into parts of Afghanistan that US Forces had never fully controlled and fighting weekly if not daily, during that time we had three KIA's and five WIA's including three amputees.   But during that time we also saw local children go to the school and begin to start their education and their families were under constant threat of Taliban harassment, harassment that we tried to stop.  We attempted to get girls to go to the school, it wasn't us stopping them, we tried to provide security but their families wouldn't let them.  (I may be wrong about us not getting any girls in the school, I wasn't part of the surveys as I was on security).  I also want to say that the disrepair witnessed by the the author and her team is just a fact of life in the rural parts of Afghanistan, I don't know what it was like in the big cities as I was never stationed there, but we had to constantly stop local's from stealing our discarded waste to sell or use.  When a new construction project goes up there were instantly children and locals trying to beg, borrow and steal anything that they could.  When we couldn't constantly monitor the site, things went missing.  It was also simple things, one day we went into the school to find all the desks piled to one side.  They students just weren't use to sitting in chairs, didn't like them so they moved them and sat on the floor.    So I do think that there were serious mis-steps in the handling of the Afghan school projects, however I take issue with this article trying to put a face on those failures with my unit and LT DeNenno.  We had successes and failures to be sure, but I walked away from that school feeling like we had made a small difference.    I also never heard of any of the ""warlords"" in our area acting as anything other than political leaders with armed security.  That being said I was a low level member of the unit without access to some of the intel that others may of had.  So sorry for the wall of test, just wanted to add my 2 cents."

I suspect it's worsened partly because the scale of pay in government relative to the private sector they regulate is so grossly disproportional (for a shared skillset type of job) that the people who do end up in the public service are either truly dedicated, have personal reasons to avoid private (e.g. family, work/life balance), and it really appears that some are biding their time and making decisions that will pay off when they return to the fold.  I don't think it comes from a place of malicious scheming, necessarily, but for someone subsumed in that institutional culture before and after their time in government, it makes sense that their world view and opinions would align more with private than public interests.   I don't think so much that it needs to be prohibited to move back and forth, as you say you can't just ignore the fact that the experience and knowledge going in both directions is valuable, but perhaps the regulator needs to draw a larger share of the financial industry's massive profits (especially on complex products like derivatives) through taxes or fees, such that these agencies can be adequately staffed with well paid people who can remain on the public side for the long term and not suffer such a huge opportunity cost."

On those occasions where I run out of pills for a week or so, the pains start returning again.  I'm almost 60. 5-8, 165 lbs. Seven days a week do 200 push ups, 90 deep squats, 25 chin ups. Three days a week add to that 40 minutes on an elliptical machine, to a dripping sweat.

Then again, even if the effect is real, what works for one person won't necessarily work for another, because of genetic and environmental differences.  I got my dad on fish oil pills years ago too. He's near 85 now, and does lots of yard work and gardening, grocery store errands, fixes plumbing, electrical and carpentry problems around the house, and finished a major kitchen remodeling for mom only a couple months ago (I helped).

I was on them for years without problems before I started noticing gradually increasing pains in often used joints. I thought I had carpel tunnel syndrome, and tennis elbow for a while, and acted accordingly. It gradually got worse, until I couldn't use a computer mouse at all with my right hand any more, and had to switch to left indefinitely. I'd also sometimes have such severe sudden pains in my knees it could almost cause me to collapse. The pain build up was intermittent at first, but eventually became continuous, and finally excruciating. Internet research finally alerted me to the possible culprit, and stopping them made the pain gradually go away. I informed my doc many weeks later and he switched me to a slightly different statin, at a much lower dose. Got along well with that for a year or two, then he upped the dose again, and the pain came back, this time in my left shoulder and arm, and I had to stop again. It's been a couple months, and it still hasn't healed back all the way yet (but at least the pain is much reduced). I guess I'll either have to quit them entirely or just go back to the tiny daily dose. The doc tried to put me on a non-statin, but it would have cost me $200 a month, and I couldn't afford it.

TrueReddit,3cqwm2,rynchpln,5,Fri Jul 10 01:32:01 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of bidets too, but there are many reasons why bidets are currently not popular in the US:   Warm water is a whole lot more comfortable than cold water, but those fancy washlet toilets are expensive.  Like, we're talking a few hundred for a seat alone, or up to several thousand for a toilet with an integrated bidet.  They also require a special electrical outlet near the toilet, which virtually no American homes have... so throw in another couple hundred dollars for an electrician.  Most people don't replace the standard cheap builder's toilet that came with the house unless they're doing a major renovation. The barebones, cold water washlets aren't that great, and they look like some kind of weird and embarrassing medical appliance. Separate, European-style bidets take up a lot of bathroom space.  When space is limited, I think most Americans will opt for a larger sink area instead of a separate bidet. In Japan, a highly corrupt construction industry that profits from corporate kickbacks is largely responsible for the high number of bidet toilets installed in homes.  Homes also have a shorter life expectancy in Japan - new buyers prefer to demolish the existing building and buy something new, and new construction generally comes with bidet because the toilet companies have cozy relationships with the construction companies.  Homes (and bathrooms) are much older on average in the US, and most new construction comes with the cheapest possible toilet. The American sewage system handles paper just fine, so there's no practical reason to switch unless one is dissatisfied with paper.  And most people aren't.  With normal toilet hygiene, there aren't epidemics of fecally-transmitted diseases or anything, so what we're doing right now seems to be adequate for the majority. There's no cultural/religious pressure to perform ritual cleansing with water after pooping.  Paper gets most people functionally clean, so water just adds an extra psychological feeling of cleanliness. Bidets are seen as something pointlessly extravagant and French.  I think the connotation of bidets with sex work has mostly been lost, though."

Therefore building a dual plumbing system at either the consumer or municipal level is difficult to argue from the sake of overall resources required if resource management and the carbon footprint costs are included."

I don't think any reasonable person would say that politics played no role in the rise of ISIS, however, to say that:   It’s not ISIS’s interpretation of Islamic texts that drives its brutality—it’s the group’s desired brutality driving its interpretation of the texts.   is disingenuous. Any literal interpretation of the Christian Bible will tell you that it is perfectly fine to own and keep slaves the same is true of a literal interpretation of the Qur'an.   The reformation of Christianity brought about a more peaceful Christian world because they moved further away from the literal interpretation of the book. The Muslim world (and since we live in a globalised world now we as well) would benefit greatly if people moved away from a literal interpretation of  the Qur'an.  tldr; things are complicated."

While the ""Christian Bible"" does include all the Torah, you specifically directed your derision towards Christians, when the Torah correctly applies to all Jews, Christians, and Muslims.    Second, which reformation of Christianity are you referring?  The Reformation proceeded slavery's abolition by centuries.  Even after most of the major Christian sects embraced abolition in the USA (post-Civil War), and ignoring WW1 and WW2, you have the genocide of the Tutsi (mix of Christianity and Islam) by the Hutu's (majority Christian) in Rwanda in 1994.  And neither group is renowned for their literal interpretations of their religious texts.

When I mention the Christian bible I do mean to include the 'Old Testament' within that as well (Jesus mentions a couple of times that Jewish law should be upheld).  I am referring to the reformation started by Martin Luther in the mid 1500's, which as you rightly said preceded abolitionist movements by at least a couple of centuries, however, it certainly paved the way to the end of slavery. My US history is not great as I have never studied it but I am fairly certain that US defenders of slavery used a literal interpretation of the Christian bible to support their position as well.  I can't really speak to the Rwandan point that you raised because I only know of the genocide from the movie Hotel Rwanda.   I agree to an extent that there is nothing singular to the evil of ISIS in the sordid history of human civilisation but to say that a literal interpretation of the texts does not lead to violence is misleading at best.

Except none of those conflicts were primarily organized around religion. With ISIS and the conflict in Syria/Iraq, religion is the organizing factor (as opposed to say Rwanda which was organized around ethnicity). With ISIS their religious beliefs define who their enemies are, their laws, their view of history, and of the future.    I cannot help but support Ms. Gilsinan's conclusions, because there is nothing singular about ISIS's brand of evil that supports the conclusion that it could not exist without the brand of Islam attached to it.   Obviously violent extremists groups exist outside of Islam, but this point is meaningless. The who, what, where, when, and how of ISIS is all dictated by their religion.   I think this story does a much better job of explaining the relationship between ISIS and Islam (for example why ISIS is more focused on territorial control & expansion than AQ).  http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/"

It’s not, she said, the group’s interpretation of Islamic texts that drives its brutality—it’s the group’s desired brutality driving its interpretation of the texts. “We start at the violence we want to conduct, and we convince ourselves that this is the correct way to interpret the texts,” she said.   I see it as the opposite. Islamic (as well as other Abrahamic) texts clearly promote this sort of behavior. It is just that decent people rationalize the texts so they can claim faith while not following the literal, brutal teachings of these foundational texts. Literalism almost always leads to extremism.   If that implies that it’s not terribly informative to question the degree of ISIS’s Islamic-ness, it still leaves the question of why ISIS has emerged now. Mogahed said one possible reason involved Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. “He has massacred far more people than ISIS has,” she said. A key variable in the group’s seemingly sudden emergence, then, is not its interpretation of Islam, according to Mogahed. “I think it’s the product of the brutality of this war that we’ve ignored.”   Oh come on. ISIS's leaders existed well before the Syrian war. It also doesn't explain things like the difference between AQ and ISIS. Where the Syrian war came in is that it allowed them to gain control of physical control of territory which then feed into their millenarian goals of setting up a Caliphate."

(totally fine) The theory is used to construct testing methods which provide quantitative measurements that correlate well with qualitative observations. (still fine) These testing methods are applied to perform large scale research on the relevant trait without having to carry out strenuous and expensive amounts of qualitative research. (again, fine) The quantitative measurements created by the testing methods come to be treated as if they were direct measurements of the relevant trait. (here's where things start to go off the rails) The testing methodology is used to overrule, undermine and/or evaluate qualitative observations of the trait. (boom, full on reification).   If you want to research sex offenders (or say, intelligence, ideology, spirituality etc.) across a large population - use the standardized test. If you want to find out whether an individual is a sex offender (or a genius, or a socialist, or some kind of weird new-age pseudo-taoist mystic), have a goddamn conversation with them and be prepared to use your own judgement, or better yet, get an expert to do that for you.

Lending is a huge economic driver. Every successful nation is in debt because borrowing allowed them to succeed. Our economic system is named capitalism. Capital is money. If you want to build anything great, you need money, which you'll probably have to borrow.  Another consistent difference between failed states and the first world is the ability to deposit money to keep it safe.  Common banks offer this service. More importantly, the national banks manage the economy to limit inflation. Your deposit is worthless after inflation eats it away. Good economic management is essential.  There is yet another type of bank; investment banks. These huge banks offer one essential service: market liquidity. They're market makers who ensure that you can buy or sell whatever stock you want today without waiting for a counter-party. They're always available during market hours. Liquidity is huge and makes the markets work.  Those four services are essential to any modern economy. ""What the Banks contribute to GDP"" is not an important part of the discussion.

TrueReddit,3cke1g,cahaseler,22,Wed Jul 8 16:24:50 2015 UTC,"Submission Statement  This article was written by the mods of /r/IAMA as a response to the press articles promoted by the admins after the chaos of last weekend. It gets to the heart of why the IAMA shutdown happened from the people who shut it down, and emphasizes that the shutdown was triggered by a lack of communication and a need for time to regroup rather than a strict protest. The article also calls out the Admins claims of ""miscommunication"", calling it mismanagement instead."
TrueReddit,3cke1g,throwthisidaway,26,Wed Jul 8 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"This is the kind of response one would expect from a large corporation, making a public statement regarding a major incident related to there day to day operations. The stark contrast between this and the official word from the interim CEO, further drives home the point.  It really raises the question, why is the public figurehead of a large company whose entire purpose is communication, failing so noticeably at communicating?"
TrueReddit,3cke1g,ShiftingParadigme,10,Wed Jul 8 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, this is a very well crafted statement, and Reddits official announcement pales in comparison.  To answer your question though, I think Pao (or maybe even the whole administration, or atleast /u/kn0thing aswell) is failing because she's out of touch with what reddit is, and what makes it thrive. Either because she's lost sight of what Reddit is or because she's treating her job as a CEO of a company where she only has to answer to her owners - which you can get away with in a regular company where you only have paid workers because they can't really revolt (especially in the US). Reddit is mainly run by volunteers though, which have different needs - and power  - than regular workers have. Which is something I think Reddits CEO has learned the hard way lately."
TrueReddit,3cke1g,12b46q,5,Wed Jul 8 19:40:53 2015 UTC,"It's well written, but it starts with the assumptions that a) IAMA is more important than other subs, and b) the goals of the few mods of IAMA are the correct goals for Reddit.  It's a PR clearing house subreddit. It's interesting, but is it more important than a 5k subscriber sub?   If moderating is so difficult, why wouldn't you step down? There certainly wouldn't be a shortage of volunteers forming a line around the block to replace you.   I also find it odd to mention in your complaint that Victoria is one of the few high profile women in tech at Reddit, when the complaint is aimed at another high profile woman in tech at Reddit.  The whole shut down protest, to me, came across as children having a temper tantrum. It certainly wasn't helped by the undeniably large percentage of misogynists and racists attacking Pao's gender and ethnicity in an effort to coopt the outrage. She may or may not turn out to be any good at her job, but she's not going to get a fair evaluation from such a hate filled user base. Which leaves the last point...  Why is Victoria's dismissal more damaging to Reddit's future than the continued astroturfing of hate groups? Victoria can be replaced, but the other eats away at the foundations of legitimacy for the entire community."

Maybe even hire some of the mods, or at least offer to hire them, to make it look like we weren't just throwing them under the bus.  Because this whole situation of relying on volunteers to run everything just isn't sustainable if Reddit wants to grow as a business. You can't balance the need for a company to be profitable with the fact that all your profit driving pages are run by people outside company control. It's just madness.  I'm trying to imagine how the offices of Reddit must have been when all their most popular subs just went offline for 24 hours and there was nothing they could do. The CEO must be getting asked, 'so are you in charge of this company, or are the users'?"

This is probably taking us 2-3 6 man-hours a day as a modteam, though I'm sure Vic was faster.  2) Sitting on the phone with (and Vic did in person too) 2-3 AMA subjects a day, for an hour or two each. This has been a real pain for us as we have real jobs. We've been making the australians do it in the middle of the night, or taking long lunches.  3) Researching potential AMA subjects, finding contact emails, reaching out to them with a pitch, calling them as needed, doing everything to promote AMAs. We haven't had time for any of this.  4) Corresponding with mods of a dozen subreddits to coordinate these AMAs, make sure everything is working well, contacting the rest of the admin team on behalf of these mods because adminmail was being ignored, and other community management tasks.  5) I'm sure there was other stuff we didn't even see."

There are some other pretty ignorant things in the article - to name a few, citing the average household credit balance for household that carries a balance at 15k and then drawing conclusions based on that for all households.  Nevermind that the actual average balance for all households is 7k, a number from their own link that they apparently chose not to use because it was smaller, despite being the number that actually reflects what they were discussing.  Meanwhile Greeks are unable to withdraw more than a handful of dollars a day, and all imports are frozen for the forseeable future.  Greece depends on imports for food and basic necessities like medicine, and estimates have in-country stores running out in a couple weeks.

As I have observed it, at least, systemic racism is a locomotive without a conductor.  One person can't stop it, a group of well meaning people can't stop it.

If I don't say nigger and I don't refuse to work with blacks and I don't refuse to hang around blacks, I'm one of the good guys.  It's why white flight is still a thing for people who would swear they're not racist.  It's why people packed a meeting of the school board to deny black kids entry to their white school districts even though the black district was failing and the school was getting money to educate those kids.

That's huge for a survey. And that's only people who think it's the biggest component; racism wouldn't be irrelevant here even if we ignore the theoretical percentage of people who perceive it as a factor. The question doesn't distinguish between past and present racism, even if past racism leads to current circumstances. Did millions of people grow up today because of discrimination and segregation that occurred a generation or so before? Sure. Are even poor people answering that question all going to process their response and the intersection of racism and opportunity in the exact same way? No. The interviewer effect can bias answers based on a surveytaker's expectation for what they ought to say based on the interviewer's characteristics. I don't have a link right now but something as simple as the race or gender of a surveygiver can bias answers enormously based on expectations. I'd be interested in seeing the poll's methodology in more detail to see if they controlled for that, because many people probably faced that same pressure not to talk about race because of the stigma of doing so while black. Not to discount these results (because as I said above they're still significant in the ""racism is real"" direction even without that), but that does affect survey responses."

To make an analogy with the French situation and the fight against religious power.  At first, while institutional religion was powerful, atheists mocked and shamed the ridiculous ideas of all religious people.  Then, once the principle of atheists having as much credibility as religious people was established the strategy changed. Specific extreme anti-atheist acts of an individial would still be criticised, but all religious people would not be harassed and shamed for minor stupid actions.  Over time, it became rare to find extreme religious nuts in position of power and when a relious nut says stupid things everyone laughs and that's over.  It worked remarquably well because we stopped shaming the old lady that goes to church every Sunday. So the old lady accepted that atheists have a right to exist. And atheists let god-fearing people being ignorant.  The issue in modern US (and it is also getting worse in Europe) is that vindicative activists won, but in their ideologic purity they want to exterminate the heretics to the last one.

This author, for example, is claiming that white society treats blackness as different or unusual.  That sounds very much like a negative judgement about people based on race.  Some people claim that aspects of black culture are responsible for low educational achievement.  That is again a judgement about people based on race.  The problem, therefore, is that (wherever the fault actually lies) people will have to admit that an ostensibly racist statement about themselves is correct.  If it is the case that white society in general is responsible for the plight of black people, then each white person must admit complicity (in fact it is not clear to me what could possibly absolve one of responsibility.)  If it is the case that aspects of black society are responsible for low educational achievement, then each black person would have to admit complicity.

Racism is our acceptance of an all white Lord of the Rings cast because of “historical accuracy,” ignoring the fact that this is a world with an entirely fictionalized history.  Even when we make shit up, we want it to be white.  And racism is the fact that we all accept that it is white.    ""'White' means 'normal...'"" What?

As demonstrated in a recent University of Bristol study, climate scientists have been unconsciously avoiding statements that would let naysayers label them as 'alarmists', instead focusing on less cataclysmic potential outcomes. However, as pointed out by Michael Mann (author of the [in]famous hockey stick graph),   scientists like Schmidt who choose to focus on the middle of the curve aren't really being scientific. Worse are pseudo-sympathizers like Bjorn Lomborg who always focus on the gentlest possibilities. Because we're supposed to hope for the best and prepare for the worst, and a real scientific response would also give serious weight to the dark side of the curve.   During the author's interview with glaciologist Jason Box, strong emphasis was placed on the relationship between the fossil fuel industry and an unwillingness to change:   But let's get real, he says, fossil fuels are the dominant industry on earth, and you can't expect meaningful political change with them in control. ""There's a growing consensus that there must be a shock to the system.""  So the darker hopes arise—maybe a particularly furious El Niño or a ""carbon bubble"" where the financial markets realize that renewables have become more scalable and economical, leading to a run on fossil-fuel assets and a ""generational crash"" of the global economy that, through great suffering, buys us more time and forces change.   Finally, the author concludes,   even when you are driven to your desk in the middle of the night, quoting Norse proverbs, when you are among the most informed and most concerned, the ordinary tender mercies of the home conspire in our denial. We pour our energy into doing our jobs the best we can, avoid unpleasant topics, keep up a brave face, make compromises with even the best societies, and little by little the compartmentalization we need to survive the day adds one more bit of distance between the comfortable now and the horrors ahead. So Box turns out to be a representative figure after all. It's not enough to understand the changes that are coming. We have to find a way to live with them."

TrueReddit,3chkxf,illStudyTomorrow,114,Wed Jul 8 14:43:17 2015 UTC,"Cosby said yes when asked, ""was it in your mind that you were going to use these Quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?"" This impeccable piece of journalist left it out for some reason. This, of course, does not directly indicate that Cosby was giving them to unwilling participants of sex (or the drug). Contrary to the belief of Reddit, women are also sentient human beings who like to partake in alcohol and drugs. If two people are about to have sex, and one of them asks ""beepity boopity do you wan' some quaalude-puddin' before we have sex!?"", and the other agreed, it is not rape. It's a mutually agreed upon drug-fueled sex-palooza.  At least one of the women said that she agreed to taking the quaalude. Of course, this is impossible to find in any article written today, thanks to such impeccable journalism as we see in the above. See this post below Regardess of how we all feel about Cosby (I personally think he was a rapist, given the fact that there are so many accusers), there is still a guaranteed right of due process. Yes, even for rapists. In order to be successfully convicted in a criminal court, we need to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he actually raped those women. This means that we need evidence beyond the accuser's testimony. Sadly, these women waited a very long time to file their case (like 20, 30 years?), so it's going to be extremely difficult to not have reasonable doubt.   (This comment brought to you by someone who is definitely going to be downvoted because it doesn't fit the narrative, despite the fact that it is more relevant than the fact-less article in OP)"
TrueReddit,3chkxf,N8CCRG,8,Wed Jul 8 04:50:35 2015 UTC,"right of due process   Not in this case. Statute of limitations. He'll never face a single charge.  But as to your point, you're not wrong, but you're not right either. The truth is that yes, the wording is ambiguous. And when the attorney asked the followup ""Did you ever give any of those young women the Quaaludes without their knowledge?"" Cosby's attorney objected and told him not to answer the question  In other words, what you have said is 100% speculation. So is the claim that he gave it to them without their knowledge. But this isn't a court of law. There is no need or interest in due process in the discussion. Because regardless of what he did, there are plenty of people out there who do what he claimed.  On top of that, though, is if he gave them the drugs not under the suggesting of wanting to have sex, but just under the auspices of hanging out and having a good time. And then raped them when they couldn't say no. Granted, I don't know enough about Quaaludes to know if they can incapacitate someone like that. Internet searching suggests maybe they can."

I really really hate it when people act like martyrs because they think they are going to get downvoted. Not only are you trying to preemptively cast yourself as some sort of victim for having an ""unpopular"" opinion (currently at +60), you are also putting way too much stock into comment karma. As much as it sucks when your meticulous and carefully made post gets downvoted, all it really reflects is that the people on at that time disagreed with you or didn't like your post. People can do this for just about any reason. At this point everybody knows that karma is a broken system and inaccurate judge for how ""good"" a post is, so for it to bruise your ego is ridiculous. Also, people disagreeing with you isn't some wrong committed against you. If that were the case, every controversial topic would basically be the holocaust. People disagree. It's a basic part of human interaction. If people didn't disagree, they would probably cease to be individuals on a certain level. Don't cry about it, especially before it even happens.  I guess I really dislike karma in a certain sense. Sure, it organizes comments and to a degree keeps out inanity or things that are wrong, but it makes everything into a silly popularity contest that nobody seems to be able to escape from mentally. Even I crave knowing what people agree and disagree with, and get some endorphins pumping when I see a high number next to a post.

Corroborating evidence (separate evidence that verifies the testimony) is not required. Your personal beliefs as to what is convincing does not matter until you're sitting on a jury.  Bottom line is that you are wrong. A witness sitting on the stand testifying (i.e., making their accusation) is sufficient for a conviction without offering a shred of other evidence.

People are refusing to attend his shows, venues are cancelling shows, NBC and Netflix nuked some upcoming projects, Disney is removing his statue, schools/organizations that were recipients of his charity are cutting ties... They have every right to do these things without having a verdict from the criminal justice system.    Nobody is overriding due process. Due process is about whether he goes to jail or not, not about what any individual is allowed to think about him... Cosby's not in jail and probably never will be. The courts don't determine 'the truth'...  judges and juries guess at the truth as best they can within the rules of evidence. Verdicts don't prove anything about anyone, and we're all free to act within the law on what we believe, whether the justice system okays our beliefs or not."

I'm attempting to explain to you that people in large groups often act illogically, unethically, stupidly, violently, ... Which is why society has created a less flawed system to determine guilt and innocence. It is the reason why our legal systems EXIST. This is not new information. Every advanced human civilization has recognized this and moved, over the millennia, towards counteracting the stupidity of people in mobs and kangaroo courts.  If you fail to see the bigger principle at play here, then you might only appreciate it when / if you are on the receiving end of public opinion, a trial by media, or a 'witch hunt'. Good luck with that."
TrueReddit,3chkxf,raplatt,3,Wed Jul 8 06:13:07 2015 UTC,"You seem unable to separate public opinion from lynch mobs and kangaroo courts. The effects of public opinion can easily function within the law, and that's what's happening with Cosby. Nobody has castrated him, murdered him, imprisoned him in their private torture chamber, or even punched him in the face.    If people don't want his picture hanging in the front hall of their school, don't want to buy his merchandise, or don't want to be associated with him because they believe he drugged and raped a bunch of women, that's OK.    ""Innocent until proven guilty"" is a legal concept that only affects legal outcomes. If you want to hitch your brain to that and assume it's the gold standard for truth, that's your decision, but there's nothing illogical, unethical, stupid or violent about someone drawing conclusions about Cosby based on what they heard outside a courtroom.      If you fail to see the bigger principle at play here, then you might only appreciate it when / if you are on the receiving end of public opinion, a trial by media, or a 'witch hunt'. Good luck with that.     Your beloved legal system also puts people on death row who didn't do the crime... and other people who did do the crime will walk away -- do you acknowledge that at least?

And once you have drawn that line for us, can you tell there is a general consensus w.r.t. the line you have set out for everyone?  I am in full agreement with everything you say about Cosby and the reaction from the public. You seem to think otherwise. At any rate, as I have explained before, it is irrelevant. The only relevant point is that trial by public opinion should be discouraged, because there is no investigation, no process of discovery, no examination of evidence, etc. This point seems to escape you. So be it. I will not explain it again.    Your beloved legal system also puts people on death row    Nope. Did you miss the part where I called it a FLAWED system? Perhaps go back and actually read and understand what I have written, before grinding whatever axe you have to sharpen. I am against the death penalty, and believe the CJS globally is extremely flawed, particularly in favour of the rich. It is still, again, LESS flawed than... well, a group of people with no access to all the relevant information, making uninformed decisions, and then acting on them (however you want to define an action - throwing Cosby off a building, boycotting his shows, whatever)  Innocent until proven guilty is more than a legal concept.

This doesn't mean we need to charge the accused immediately or react as a mob. When women come forward saying they've been raped, it's very unsettling how quickly everyone rushes to defend the (accused) rapist. And I think we also need to manage the consequences of being accused of rape better. Maybe instead of demonizing the person entirely we should listen to what the victim wants to repair the situation. Maybe the rapist needs to learn about consent (and maybe this can be done publicly and the public can also learn about consent because even the way we talk about rape doesn't really acknowledge consent appropriately) and some real benefit can occur. It doesn't need to be world ending for victim or the perpetrator, I think there's opportunity for everyone to learn and heal.."
TrueReddit,3chkxf,Rentun,3,Wed Jul 8 04:51:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think we should believe or disbelieve them unless there's other evidence to either support or refute them.   I think few people wouldn't believe a woman who said ""I was raped"". Believing that statement without any other evidence doesn't have any negative consequences. It's the same as if I made a police report that I had something stolen. No one is going to doubt either story.  It gets more complicated when someone says ""I was raped by this person"" or ""This person stole something from me"". In that case, believing that person necessarily means the you believe the person they accused is guilty of a crime with zero other evidence. Obviously they shouldn't be dismissed or assumed to be lying, but allegations of a crime against a person should be investigated and taken seriously, or at least backed up by some other form of evidence before making any judgement call."
TrueReddit,3chkxf,silent_h,3,Wed Jul 8 14:35:09 2015 UTC,"I guess that's the sort of thinking that makes believing rape victims so difficult. We assume that we necessarily find someone guilty by believing a rape victim, but is that how it actually works? Is there another way we can think about it? Is it possible to believe both the victim and the accused rapist (if they deny it) but still find a way to create healing. The accused rapist is, after all, being accused for a reason so maybe something does need to be done. I think there's opportunity for more nuance and it starts with believing rape victims, regardless of what it means for (accused) rapists. But currently when we demand that rape is ""proven"" and that we assume a rape victim is lying until they provide proof for fear of following through on a false accusation, we do a tremendous amount of damage to rape victims."

I think innocent until proven guilty is important in a court context because courts can send a person to jail for life or, in some jurisdictions, kill him. I ( and the public) do not have these life or death deciding powers so I feel more assured in merely looking at what evidence I have and judging accordingly.   In short, I feel bad that you were downvoted for supporting individual critical thinking on these matters, and I suspect the down voters  may be confusing stringent (that is, good) legal process with moral judgement (something that should be universal and individual)."
TrueReddit,3chkxf,silent_h,2,Wed Jul 8 20:46:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Folks seem to default to the legal system for sorting things out but sometimes rape victims just want to warn people (rather than pursue charges or have things go to court, etc.). The requirements for legal prosecution don't seem to work very well with rape compared to other criminal charges. Plus, I think our legal system is fucked (punishment instead of restitution or healing) so I'm not going to look to it to tell me what to believe, especially in cases of rape.

The conservative Christian right folks just love these speeches.  Other people think he enjoys the money his lecturing/pandering has brought him, and now it just looks like he is a huge hypocrite.  I am pasting the speech here that he gave to the NAACP on the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision for your edification:  'They're standing on the corner and they can't speak English. I can't even talk the way these people talk...  Why you ain't  Where you is  What he drive  Where he stay  Where he work  Who you be...  And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk.   And then I heard the father talk.  Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth.  In fact, you will never get any kind of job making a decent living. People marched and were hit in the face with rocks to get an education, and now we've got these knuckleheads walking around.  The lower economic people are not holding up their end in this deal.  These people are not parenting. They are buying things for kids. $500 sneakers for what??  And they won't spend $200 for Hooked on Phonics.  I am talking about these people who cry when their son is standing there in an orange suit.  Where were you when he was 2??  Where were you when he was 12??  Where were you when he was 18 and how come you didn't know that he had a pistol??  And where is the father?? Or, who is his father?  People putting their clothes on backward, isn't that a sign of something gone wrong?  People with their hats on backward, pants down around the crack, isn't that a sign of something?  Or, are you waiting for Jesus to pull his pants up?  Isn't it a sign of something when she has her dress all the way up and got all type of needles [piercing] going through her body?

We have millionaire football players who cannot read.  We have million-dollar basketball players who can't write two paragraphs.  We, as black folks have to do a better job. Someone working at Wal- Mart with seven kids... you are hurting us.  We have to start holding each other to a higher standard.""  There is also his ""Pound cake"" speech.  He has made a career of not only acting, stand-up, directing, and music, but also of writing social commentary and speaking on social ills, primarily pointing out what he sees wrong with modern blacks.  Some of his critics point out that he ignores any socioeconomic harm white culture may have perpetrated on blacks in America.    I am not judging the merits of his  speeches here...but I do think that this might be a classic case of guilt transference...and that is being kind to the man.    Bill Cosby will never spend a night in jail for what he has done to multiple women over decades of his life.  He is rich and powerful and he has bevies of lawyers and rich friends to support and defend him.  If he was poor, he would be in jail.

He has lost civil suits and settled out of court for sexual assault though.  A comedian named Hannibal Burress had a routine about it in 2014, and it became very popular which lead to a lot of media outlets revisiting the allegations and giving them a lot more publicity.

Thirdly, Germany already forgave Greece haf of its debt. After which they failed to implement sufficient changes. It's human nature to get away with as little change as possible and that just ain't gonna cut it in the case of Greece.  I think in the end the Greek debt will be forgiven, but the debtors want to see some significant and lasting changes implemented so that they won't have to dump money into Greece every few years.

It is common among individuals that work directly with trauma victims such as nurses, psychologists,first responders, and health unit coordinators. It was first diagnosed in nurses in the 1950s. Sufferers can exhibit several symptoms including hopelessness, a decrease in experiences of pleasure, constant stress and anxiety, sleeplessness or nightmares, and a pervasive negative attitude. This can have detrimental effects on individuals, both professionally and personally, including a decrease in productivity, the inability to focus, and the development of new feelings of incompetency and self-doubt.

My son often reacted to feeling overwhelmed by sitting at his desk and making occasional bleep-bloop sounds. Although other students giggled, his 6th grade teacher took personal offense and often angrily confronted him in the classroom. She tried to have him suspended, but the principal felt she was overreacting. By the end of the school year, she had already arranged to have him sent to an alternative school for juvenile delinquents.   When we found out, we took every action to reverse her mandate, without success. My 12 year old son spent a year fearfully attending a detention style school with 14 - 18 year old kids who carried weapons, who were frequently arrested and who threatened him and others with violence every day.   One teacher immediately recognized that my son had no business being at this school and took him under his protection. He moved mountains to get my son accepted back into public school the following year, and regularly kept in contact with him until he graduated; he even attended the graduation and wrote him an incredible letter praising his endurance and accomplishments    While I'm grateful for that teacher's intervention and advocacy, I can't forget the 6th grade horror who responded to bleep-bloops with what amounted to Prison 101.

In that sort of situation it's much easier to make sure that the child doesn't reach boiling point, and somebody's there to take him somewhere safe if the situation does get that bad. Although I'm aware that that is not a reality in the majority of places.  All that said, if the child is going to get violent, it doesn't matter much in the moment if you've got a behavior chart, yellow and red cards, a progressive system, or corporal punishment.

That would be ideal. Obviously though, that's not always possible everywhere.   In fact the situation you mention is likely the sort of situation that leads to many of the suspensions and expulsions the author mentioned in the article. An environment where a teacher is left alone to take care of a class with one or more problem children is going to lead to that teacher having to take drastic measures.  What I want to say is that I think the approach outlined in the article could be a fantastic revelation, but as always, questions of resources will hamper its development. Whether they be resources to retrain teachers or to provide extra specialist staff.   Then again there are quite a number of teachers, particularly veteran ones, who think things like this are a load of old bullshit.

In today's society more economic growth usually produces more c02, or instance the great recession cut c02 output a little, but with regulation, and a state commitment to reducing c02 you could obviously have growth with reduced c02.   Google doesn't know what to do with it's money in part because (compared to the Bretton Woods era 'golden age of capitalism') there are relatively few investment opportunities for the huge amounts of money out there.

Fuller's vision was that ephemeralization will result in ever-increasing standards of living for an ever-growing population despite finite resources. The concept has been embraced by those who argue against Malthusian philosophy.   Fuller uses Henry Ford's assembly line as an example of how ephemeralization can continuously lead to better products at lower cost with no upper bound on productivity. Fuller saw ephemeralization as an inevitable trend in human development. The progression was from ""compression"" to ""tension"" to ""visual"" to ""abstract electrical"" (i.e., nonsensorial radiation, such as radio waves, x rays, etc.).   Length measurement technologies in human development, for example, started with a compressive measure, such as a ruler. The compressive technique reached an upper limit with a rod. For longer measures, a tensive measure such as a string or rope was used. This reached an upper limit with sagging of the string. Next was a surveyor’s telescope (visual). This reached an upper limit with curvature of the earth. Next was radio triangulation (abstract electrical). The technological progression is a continuing increase in length-measuring ability per pound of instrument, with no apparent upper limit according to Fuller.

TrueReddit,3ckpmc,freakwent,2,Wed Jul 8 19:48:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah maybe.  I think the drug war is a stretch.  I think there are a lot of problems that aren't being discussed, especially if you overlap self-driving cars with Uber.   Who owns the car? Who pays rego costs? Who writes/updates/controls the code? Who has the final control over where the car goes?   Also   Given all the extra complexity, what happens if there's a significant Internet disruption -- do the cars need constant internet communication to do their job properly?   Once the concept of a cheap self-driving taxi is widely embraced, the govt can hike rego costs and price out private ownership for normal workers under the banners of the sharing economy and economic efficiency.  I can see the concept evolving into a model of cars owned by google, uber and others which people just book online, cheaper and easier than owning a car, no capital investment required, everyone thinks it's ever-so-millenial and cool.  As a bonus, this means that for many people costs of living fall, so wages can stagnate without people getting upset.  Then the cars get bigger, and hold more passengers, and stop on the way to pick people up.  Going point to point is now an express selection in the app, with a 35% surcharge -- like surge pricing!  The pretty obvious end result is the elimination of road-based public transport and private cars for the masses in favour of a privately owned mass transit system, on roads funded from public revenue, and plenty of free road space for those rich enough to have private cars.  I think that the problems you're citing aren't big problems, and they can all be solved pretty easily IMO with simpler measures than self-driving cars.  You're trying to treat symptoms of bigger problems.  Making traffic flow better doesn't solve all the other problems arising from a commuting lifestyle.  Adding self-driving cars doesn't stop private drivers from speeding.  It would be far easier for cops to search a car if the owner isn't there, it would be similar to an RBT.  Your other problems, and a lot more, are best addressed by a more solid education system and a more rigorous licence testing regime."

You see people say that family court is biased against fathers, but this hammers it home just how bad it can get.   This is a father who wanted to parent his child from the start before birth even. Yet he had to jump through hoops in order to get custody - not because he had done anything wrong, but just because.  And suppose he hadn't filled out the putative father registry - which is hardly a great failing. He would almost certainly have lost custody for good.   Just imagine if women had to sign up for a mother's registry (that was not publicized and most people were not aware of) and if they failed to do so, it would be legal for their kids to be taken away from them even if they wanted custody."

The court recognized the birth mother's deception and reversed the adoption.  This is an example of family court reaching the correct result, not ""bias.""  Hell, at the final hearing terminating her parental rights, the court seemed to react to the story pretty much the way  we do:   At the final hearing, the judge condemned Skylar’s mother and her parents. “The court is very concerned about the deception of the Defendant in denying the Plaintiff his parental rights,” the judge said. “The court is concerned with the Defendant’s deception to the court … The conscious and continuing deception of the Defendant is very concerning. The court is also concerned about the ignorance and racism exhibited by the Defendant and the Defendant’s family.”"

However, the father legally took the kid and gave it up for adoption to random unrelated people. And, the baby was physically in their custody.  Then, the mother had to go to court several times to prove she would be a good mother and deserves to be a parent.   She has to demonstrate that she should be allowed to parent her own child. Not because she has done anything wrong like abuse or drug addiction to suggest she is unfit. But just because she's a mother.  And the icing - if she had neglected to sign up for the mother registry - which is not publicized and most people are unaware of - she would likely not have gotten custody.  However, a father doesn't need to do any of this - as long as he proves he's the father, he will get custody.  Would women find this acceptable? Or would they say the system was biased?"
TrueReddit,3cieb4,ashlaaaaay,5,Wed Jul 8 15:08:29 2015 UTC,"I work in adoptions. The laws referenced in the article all vary by state. The opening paragraph, and any generalizations to the US afterwards, are all misleading.    For example, in Washington state, the adoptive parents or agency petitioning for the termination of parental rights must submit a statement from the birth mother to the court listing any possible father of the child, as well as her husband, even if he isn't the father. The rights of each of the possible fathers (and the husband) must be terminated by consent, default, or trial. It can be a very time consuming process, but they have to do their due diligence and at least try to find each of them. It's not easy to terminate the rights of a father who wants to keep the child, at least in Washington. Most private agencies won't even put up a fight and just have the court proceeding dismissed after returning custody to the mother.    For those wondering why the mom gets the kid, it's because the father would still have to formally establish paternity in or before a custody action, though adoption workers usually are satisfied with a reliable DNA test. Despite the clear bias there, it is a lot easier to determine who the mother of a child is than who the father is."
TrueReddit,3cieb4,Namtara,0,Wed Jul 8 14:55:14 2015 UTC,It doesn't work that way in practice. Typically bureaucrats will do everything in their power to bypass the rights of the father.
TrueReddit,3cieb4,Namtara,2,Wed Jul 8 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"It does work that way if the attorneys do everything by the book. Adoption in Washington is governed strictly by statute. Failing to follow the statutes typically results in the court refusing to issue a final decree or otherwise causing the adoption to be overturned.    If you want to argue about people not complying with the law, then that's a completely different issue than the legal rights of a birth father in an adoption."
TrueReddit,3cieb4,Namtara,-7,Wed Jul 8 22:37:07 2015 UTC,"Nope.  In no state do adoptions require the consent, or even knowledge, of the father.  Edit: This is sad...downvoting a factual statement in TrueReddit."
TrueReddit,3cieb4,Namtara,5,Wed Jul 8 15:09:04 2015 UTC,"You are correct at least for Washington. The consent or knowledge of either parent is not an absolute requirement for adoptions, whether through the state, private agency, or otherwise. We have handled cases in a variety of circumstances where neither parent was contacted, let alone consented.    That said, there is a due diligence requirement for the petitioners to try to find all possible birth parents. We have to provide information on the searches we did, what info we did have, and any results. We have to attempt to serve notice at each parent's last known address or where we have reason to expect to find them, like their job. If we find absolutely no last known address (it could literally be from decades ago, it's still the last known address) or have no success with service, we then publish in the county of their last known whereabouts. It's a long shot at this point, but at least we get the info out there.    If we go through all this and have no luck finding one of the possible BPs, then we can have the court declare them to be in default and then terminate their parental rights without further notice requirements. In the off chance they pop up between the default and the TPR order, we do have to give notice and default is no longer an option.   If a birth parent appears, but does not consent, then the petitioners must argue that the birth parent has not fulfilled their duties and obligations to the child. This refers to a long, vague list of financial, emotional, and physical responsibilities.  The usual arguments revolve around abandonment, lack of financial support, physical or emotional abuse, etc. The birth parent can argue against this and then it will become a trial. You won't find any public records available on these issues because they are sealed files regardless of the outcome. Appeals only include initials for the parties.    However, all these requirements and rules apply to both parents. The only reason a mother does not have to prove her relationship is because she physically gave birth to the child. Even if there was a weird situation where there was a surrogate, there must be a signed surrogacy agreement or else she is considered a parent under Washington law. There are similar issues for egg, sperm, and embryo donors where the lack of a signed agreement waiving rights to a child means that the owners of the gametes or embryos are also parents.    So here is the crazy hypothetical to illustrate: Woman A and Man B donate their gametes to Woman C and Woman D.  The donor agreement includes the intention that C and D be the parents of any child born from an embryo created by those gametes, but they forgot to include proper language that A and B would waive parental rights. C and D break up after combining the gametes into embryos. C marries Man E and D marries Man F. C/E and D/F sue each other for the embryos. C/E ignore their lawyer and... t.b.c."
TrueReddit,3cieb4,Namtara,4,Wed Jul 8 20:39:54 2015 UTC,"Continued from above.    ...They have Woman G, a surrogate, impregnated with multiple embryos. They did not sign a surrogacy agreement. G was married to Man H before this occurred, but then divorced him and married Man I and within 300 days of the child's birth.    The baby is born! And suddenly everyone has flip flopped and realized they really don't want the kid. They put the baby up for adoption. Every single one of A-I must have their parental rights terminated through the same process. The agreements failed to terminate the rights of A, B, G, H, and I like they should have. Spouses of a birth parent are presumed parents, so even though E, F, H, and I are not genetically related or capable of physically giving birth to the kid, they have the same rights as the rest. C and D were given rights by the agreement and also have valid rights.     In sum, the only ""edge"" a birth mother has over a birth father in adoptions is that she does not need to prove her relationship if she is the one that gave birth, assuming someone doesn't find a surrogacy agreement. Any genetic father not married to her can still appear in an adoption proceeding and it will be unable to finalize until his rights are terminated, which can be very difficult if he puts in the effort and does his paperwork.    And remember this info is just a generalization of how this works in Washington. There is a ton more detail and nuance, and the specifics even very by county!"
TrueReddit,3cieb4,Namtara,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:52:45 2015 UTC,"What if the mother simply says she doesn't know who the father is? And has no contact info?  What do the agencies do?

TrueReddit,3cieb4,musthavesoundeffects,5,Thu Jul 9 00:24:44 2015 UTC,"If a birth mother says she does not know who the father is, we publish notice to John Doe in the county where the child was conceived. The notice will include the time frame and location and the full name of the birth mother. If we have ANY information, including a nickname, we must include it in the notice. This situation is pretty common for one night stands. Most birth mothers we have worked with are very cooperative and we locate birth fathers about 80% of the time. Those that claim to be afraid for their safety usually provide info once we ask the court to strike the birth mother's contact information from the documents served to the birth father. The remaining 20% are usually when we don't have a name, have only a partial name, the birth father is homeless or otherwise has moved without a trace, or the birth father is ducking service. The last situation usually happens when the birth father is married to someone else.    As for the argument of fitness, that only comes up If an adoption goes to trial. This is extremely rare in adoptions where both parents' rights are to be terminated. As I said above, most private agencies duck out completely if one parent wants the kid. The state is a can of worms on its own, but they come in when the situation is desperate enough that they think the best interest of the child is adoption, so of course they will put both parents through the wringer.   As to why the father is usually the one making these arguments at all, it is more about technicalities causing a procedural bias rather than anything intentional or out of principal. Technicality 1: the person who gives birth to a child is a parent by law, unless there is a surrogacy agreement. This of course means the birth mother. Technicality 2: The state does NOT assume any genetic relationships with regard to parental rights. This doesn't come across as very intuitive, but it is structured that way for a reason.   Washington state has determined that it is in the child's best interest and the state's best interest that the people responsible for the conception of a child be granted legal rights as parents. You could write a book on this issue, but it is the basis for why there must be at least two parents: The birth mother and genetic father. There might be a separate genetic mother, a presumed father who is married to the birth mother, and quite literally dozens of other parents. There is always at least 2.    So let's bring this back to your issue. The reason the birth mother's rights are assumed at birth is because she gave birth. It has nothing to do with genetics. Her proof is the birth certificate where a medical professional certifies that she gave birth. However, someone coming along claiming to be the father is claiming a genetic basis. He needs to prove that genetic relationship. If he was married to the birth mother, he wouldn't have to because he is a presumed father, but he might need proof of a legal marriage. If he had a surrogacy agreement listing him as an intended father, he also would not need to prove an genetic relationship, but he would need the agreement. Any parent asserting their legal rights would need proof of the relationship.    Next, there is the issue of fitness. The reason a birth father would argue he is fit is only because the petitioner will be arguing he isn't. If the petitioner gives up the adoption, it is just dismissed and left to the parents to sort out custody. Custody is a completely different process, and I can't give you a very competent explanation of those issues.   The simple fact is that adoptions through private agencies most commonly deal with children born to couples that are not married. Thus, birth fathers usually have to prove their relationship when challenging an adoption. The law was not set up to be easy or difficult for anyone in particular."

This situation is pretty common for one night stands.   This makes sense and seems the best that can be expected.   However, someone coming along claiming to be the father is claiming a genetic basis. He needs to prove that genetic relationship.   I understand that fathers must prove they are the biological father while mothers do not need to, as they have already shown they are the bio-mother. That makes sense and I have no problem with that.  But what doesn't make sense is why a father who wants custody (when the mother wants to adopt out the child) must jump through hoops, prove he is fit, etc. I don't mean prove he's the father - that should be required. I mean, going to court to argue for parental rights etc. even after it's established that he is the father.  In contrast, a mother who wants custody (when the father wants to adopt out the child) need do nothing. She does not need to go to court to get parental rights, does not need to prove a damn thing.  How is this fair or justified?"
TrueReddit,3cieb4,Metallio,2,Thu Jul 9 05:14:11 2015 UTC,"I'm going to split my reply into several pieces because one specifically relates to adoptions, a second is just custody issues, which I admit I am not as familiar with, the third is your scenario, and the fourth is likely what you mean to reference, which is step-parent adoptions:      Adoption: In the circumstance where a birth mother is planning an adoption and a birth father (who assumedly has proved paternity at this point) opposes it, most private agencies just drop the whole thing and let the birth parents figure it out. In an independent adoption (no agency), the prospective adoptive parents must decide whether to try to move forward with a trial. It depends entirely on whether they think they have a chance of succeeding at trial. If the situation is an abusive spouse or partner who never supported the kid, they have a pretty good chance of succeeding. If the situation is just that the birth father only recently discovered the pregnancy and comes across as sincerely wanting to parent the kid, they are not very likely to succeed. If they decide to push for a trial anyway, what they do is petition for the termination of the birth father's parental rights (as opposed to petitioning for a relinquishment in the case of a consent). The birth father has to formally appear in the court proceeding, which is usually just filing paperwork rather than going in person. To show his sincerity to the court, the judge will be expecting a custody petition and a paternity action. The APs (or agency) will basically allege that he is unfit and usually try to accompany their allegations with declarations from the birth mother and APs. That said, it's difficult to prove a negative. It is much easier for the birth father to prove his support as long as he's kept track of it. Paying for medical expenses, childcare, clothing, and at least attempting to get custody, visitation, etc. all show intent and capability of parenting the child. Judges do not like to take kids from capable parents, so unless the birth father's a deadbeat, the least he will get is the termination petition thrown out. However, a judge in an adoption proceeding will not grant custody; he will leave that to the judge overseeing the custody action (which is entirely separate). Keep in mind that it is extremely rare for any adoptions to get to this point. Thousands upon thousands of adoptions go through without ever having a trial over the termination of parental rights. A majority of adoptions resulted because birth parents consented or were defaulted.   Custody is a monster all on its own. A birth father opposing the termination of his parental rights and petitioning for custody is really participating in two separate court proceedings. The court looks at those as having absolutely NOTHING to do with each other. The birth father, assuming he succeeds in foiling the adoption, will still have to prove that he should have custody. He will not be able to argue that the birth mother wanting to give the child up for adoption is a compelling reason that he should have the child, at least in Washington. I actually have not heard of that argument succeeding in any context, whether in adoption, custody, guardianships, etc. They just have to duke it out. However, the ""default"" custody situation is that the birth mother is going to have custody. That's because of that issue I mentioned before where she for sure birthed the child and the birth father had to prove paternity afterwards. Proving paternity does not automatically change custody, hence the custody proceeding. As you can see, those technicalities I mentioned before cause another unintentional bias where the birth mother is going to have custody first every time... unless CPS becomes involved, but that is an even bigger mess I'm not going to get into.    So with that in mind, let's look at the possible situations where a birth father wants to do an adoption, but the birth mother wants to keep the child.     A. If the birth mother has custody, no adoption is going to happen. It's already difficult to terminate parental rights of a noncustodial parent, so unless CPS and the state get involved, it is nearly impossible to terminate rights of the parent with custody. The biggest argument that any potential adoptive parents or an agency would have against the birth parent contesting the adoption is that the adoptive parents are already caring for the child and have developed a parent-child bond. That just doesn't happen if they never get custody to begin with. Courts also look down on any argument based solely on financial resources, so just because the APs are rich does not mean a thing. Hell, people well below the poverty line are able to adopt through foster care so long as the child is doing well in the home. However, this particular obstacle is true whether it's the birth father or the birth mother who has custody. This situation specifically occurs because the custodial parent does not want to do an adoption, regardless of their sex.  B.  If the birth father has custody of the child and wants to do an adoption, but the birth mother does not, it will be that same decision of whether the petitioners (APs or agency) want to go to trial. They'll weigh the same probabilities of winning at trial and make the same arguments. The birth mother will have to do the same steps, though she won't have to do a paternity action since she won't have to prove a genetic relationship. She'll still have to start a custody action, and she still won't be able to use the adoption as an argument against the birth father having custody. She'll have the same uphill battle showing why she should have custody when she wasn't the custodial parent to begin with.     Lastly, 4.  I think the situation that you are looking for specifically is a step-parent adoption. The most common situation is the deadbeat dad who won't support the birth mother or child and she eventually marries someone else. That spouse and the birth mother want the spouse to adopt the child. The birth father's rights can be terminated and the court can issue an adoption granting the spouse parental rights.  At least, that is the way that only one parent's rights are terminated while the other's is not. (They also don't have to be married in Washington, but that's beside the point.)    However, courts do not terminate parental rights unless it is in the best interest of the child. Way back in my old comment, I mentioned how there is always at least two parents. While a single person might adopt a child who had two parents before, a court has never, to my knowledge, terminated parental rights of a birth parent who just didn't want the kid. That would be against the best interests of the child and the state, since the state would very likely have to provide benefits to the child and the remaining parent. There is always at least two people responsible for a child being born, and those people cannot run away from their responsibility as a parent.  As a final comment, I think I should explain that parental rights and obligations are just automatic. They come into being as soon as the child is born. It does not matter if the child was wanted or intended. The child exists, so the parents are the ones responsible for it. That is the default scenario, so all the stuff above just follows that."

The most effective way to change their behavior is to make the behavior ""uneconomical"" to engage in. Remove the reward for it or reward them more for engaging in the behavior you find desirable.  Naturally, the catch is that different people do things for different reasons. But there aren't an unlimited variety of motives, and no one said changing human nature was easy or simple.  And no one said you shouldn't try something just because it's hard."
TrueReddit,3chpii,Ihadanapostrophe,3,Wed Jul 8 06:54:28 2015 UTC,"True, but I'm talking about the long-term.  Why is our society more liberal in current times?  It's largely because the kids grew up in an era where things were discussed and they had experiences with people from different cultures.  That's not the entire fix, to be sure, but it's a big step in the right direction.  If we ban perspectives that we disagree with, all we do is make them feel persecuted and lead them to find their own area that becomes an echo chamber.  Whether or not their beliefs are socially acceptable, as long as they aren't breaking the law or forcing their beliefs on others they shouldn't be persecuted.  Should we be more focused on making those who we disagree with suffer, or working towards a better future?  I'm all for building a better future, even if it means that I'll have to be confronted with views I don't approve of.

TrueReddit,3chpii,veninvillifishy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:34:23 2015 UTC,"That's not the entire fix, to be sure, but it's a big step in the right direction.   It's a step that was necessary but not sufficient. One does not change without also wanting to change.  What allowed the entire process to begin was the desire to engage in level-headed debate in the first place. Which, from my experience, only happens when people feel safe, secure and comfortable enough to be able to objectively engage in discussion without feeling as though they have some stake in the matter. The Enlightenment happened because the populace experienced a novel trend -- it became fashionable, for a time, to be intelligent and educated, rather than dogmatic and emotional.   Whether or not their beliefs are socially acceptable, as long as they aren't breaking the law or forcing their beliefs on others they shouldn't be persecuted.   Reddit should be utterly, absolutely and irreversibly destroyed, then. The very concept that your opinions can be publicly ""voted"" on, censored and marginalized is anathema, it is categorically mutually exclusive with changing peoples' opinions, rational debate and objective observation. You cannot feel as though you have no stake in a conversation on reddit. The entire interface is geared specifically to disallow that.  If you want an echo chamber -- you create something like reddit. And, indeed, that's precisely what reddit is known for: being an echo chamber. That's why places like 4chan are known for, yes, extreme things being said, but also the userbase being generally able to engage with new ideas. Reddit is stagnant. 4chan, not so much. 4chan suffers from age and perception (it is perceived by ""the kids"" as an old, ugly site that old, ugly people use), not from censorship.   Should we be more focused on making those who we disagree with suffer, or working towards a better future?   I didn't recommend making unpopular opinions suffer. I recommended the opposite. I merely noted that you can't strive for the future on reddit. Period.   I'm all for building a better future, even if it means that I'll have to be confronted with views I don't approve of. That's how it's worked throughout history; why should we assume that current society would be any different?   It's not. Just remember that, historically, if one forum has economic dominance, it doesn't matter what should be happening: because the interests of that forum's owners will decide things. In this case, reddit's corporate balance sheet is blindly driven by profit. Profit, as a motive, is categorically mutually exclusive with progress. Either moral, spiritual, intellectual or whatever. The entire problem the world of 2015 faces is that we find ourselves in a world driven by profit -- the horror of which is the knowledge that memeplexes, some systems of thought are self-sustained. They heal themselves. They continue for good or ill. In this case, ill.   I want to reiterate, I am not condoning any sort of harassment or illegal activity. That crosses the line.   Let's put it this way: merely having a Line That Shall Not Be Crossed means you are trapped. You're bounded. Shackled to the old cycle. Needlessly, as it happens, since laws are merely arbitrary artifacts of contemporary culture. If there is something morally repugnant that you don't want people to get into, then give them a reason to not want to. The Leviathan is what we've used throughout recorded history -- but recorded history is notoriously short, and just because we've always done it doesn't mean it's the best possible solution.   Even FPH, until they started harassing people, deserved their own subreddit, in my opinion.   If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear. Harassment might seem like it's love too tough for your taste, but your taste cannot be the arbiter of allowable behavior.   And after all, we know what sort of world it is in which words can be forbidden...   The freedom that we celebrate shouldn't just be for those we agree with; the true test is whether we are willing to support it for those we don't agree with.   And that's why I support FPH's ability to harass people.

What makes it harder to discuss this problem in the first place are the people who take Anjem Chaudhary and the existence of a couple ""Sharia morality police"" patrols made up exclusively of radical Salafi-style Islamists to be ""indicative of the attitude of the British Muslim population"", and in doing so automatically cancel out all those people who aren't in league with Chaudhary and the Salafi Islamist ""Sharia patrols"".    he believes that British Islam is getting progressively more extreme and less tolerant of non-Muslim values.   And if you hold ""Muslim values"" to be horrid 7th century Salafist Islamist values, then there's no point in even discussing the issue at any length. ""You"" as in the author.  I'm no apologist for legitimate manifestations of extreme fundamentalism or anything of that nature, but I find this sort of thing to be sort of discredited already when you see what other subs (barring UK politics) seem to be attracted towards such an article.   As a Brit, I found this a very provocative article and it has prompted me to do some research, but I have to admit, I don't yet know enough to verify how accurate the claims are.   It depends on what this woman's ultimate point is.

TrueReddit,3cg58j,TheAlchemist1,11,Tue Jul 7 19:23:47 2015 UTC,"(Can't quote your text as I'm on mobile, but I'll keep it in the same paragraph format)  You talk about the differences between the groups in Islam, and that the beliefs of a more radical group such as the Salafi is not representative of other groups and Islam as a whole, which I agree with. However, this article claims that the majority of British mosques and most of the scholars are of the conservative Deobandi group. Much of the article's weight comes from this claim, so do you agree that this is the case? Again, this is a genuine question as I'm not familiar with a lot of this.  For the ""non-Muslim values"" comment, my emphasis was on the non-Muslim part, ie. values from other cultures within Britain, including 'traditional British values'. Whilst it might be laughable to suggest that watching TV and listening to music is integral to our way of life, the freedom to enjoy these things is important, and of course, the freedom for our women to dress, act and travel as they please is much more significant. Therefore, those who reject such values are not going to integrate well into our culture, and are much more likely to become alienated.  Which leads me onto the ultimate point. If what the author writes is true, and that 'if' is important, then yes, I think there is a real threat to the contemporary British lifestyle (what we eat, how we dress, what we do), as many Muslims would be strongly opposed to this lifestyle and seek to change it. And what's more, the less integrated, patriotic and moderate a British Muslim the more susceptible he/she is to radicalisation. Literally hundreds of British Muslims, most of them young, have already been radicalised enough to join ISIS.  edit: Reworded a generalisation and added a few examples."

TrueReddit,3cg58j,Logical1ty,-2,Tue Jul 7 22:07:27 2015 UTC,"However, this article claims that the majority of British mosques and most of the scholars are of the conservative Deobandi group.    I'm not an expert at all, but I recall reading that ""Deobandis"" are essentially the arch-conservatives religiously when it comes to the Af-Pak region.   Clearly Afghans and Pakistanis living in the UK are not uniformly conservative Islamist minded in the least-- but the point here is that ""deobandism"" isn't some kind of pan-Islamic phenomena.    Much of the article's weight comes from this claim, so do you agree that this is the case?   Conservative Deobandism isn't a good thing? I agree with that.  If he's trying to claim that ""the Sunnis"" or the Afghans and Pakistanis are predisposed to deobandism to a person-- then that I don't agree with and really don't see evidence for from my outside perspective.   Whilst it might be laughable to suggest that watching TV and listening to music is integral to our way of life   To claim that ""British Muslims"" are categorically against either is to essentially claim that they are collectively on par with Wahhabis or the Taliban.  Something that's inaccurate and wholly unhelpful as far as I'm concerned.   the freedom to enjoy these things is important, and of course, the freedom for our women to dress, act and travel as they please is much more significant.   Again, that's essentially saying that ""Muslim"" values across the board, whatever they may be, are one and the same with ISIS/Taliban/Wahhabi ""values"".    Therefore, those who reject such values are not going to integrate well into our culture, and are much more likely to become alienated.   Ok, and the extreme outliers are most often going to end up being some variety of conservative or ultra-conservative Islamist.  The types who seem to think that the niqab is ""mandatory"" for the ""true Muslims"", and the same thing for the two foot long beard.  I should state at this point that it's unwise to suggest that anyone who feels themselves marginalized or alienated to whatever extent is going to be some kind of conservative Islamist or a radical by default.  A Pakistani, for example, who feels marginalized because he's called ""Paki scum"" on a regular basis by the stupider and uglier elements of ""British British"" society shouldn't be pigeonholed as an extremist or radical due to his sense of marginalization/alienation in that regard.   I think there is a real threat to the contemporary British lifestyle   I think there are enough people who try and blow this sort of thing out of proportion, and the fact that the loudest voices seem to be unable to recognize that ""the British Muslims"" are in fact a heterogeneous group-- the fact that they so often fall into blatant race baiting and advocate for mass deportation really makes it hard to see them as anything other then extremists in their own right.   they would be strongly opposed to this lifestyle and seek to change it.    That's your problem with the Salafi/Wahhabi Islamist element. I fail to see how trying to accuse Pakistani or Arab or Iranian middle class elements, for example, of being ""secret jihadis"" or ""enemies of the British way of life"" would lead to anything sane or productive in this regard.   And what's more, the less integrated, patriotic and moderate a British Muslim the more susceptible he/she is to radicalisation.   And at this point you're really only dealing with extreme outliers or otherwise people who're guillible enough to be bamboozled into thinking something else.  It's an issue worth discussing, but not with the people who don't even want to pretend to keep a level head about it.   Literally hundreds of British Muslims, most of them young, have already been radicalised enough to join ISIS.   Out of a population of millions. Literally the most extreme ones are essentially weeding themselves out for everyone to see, and then you have these kids who seem to believe that they're going off to do something radically different then what's actually waiting for them in Syria.  This latter element is considerably lesser then the legitimate wahhabist element, I should add."
TrueReddit,3cg58j,kyle_kyle_kyle_kyle,11,Tue Jul 7 20:12:49 2015 UTC,"I was actually asking if you agreed that the majority of mosques (45%) and most scholars are of the Deobandi sect, as the article claims. That's the important part, because if it's true, then that's the basis for the rest of my argument. Whilst it is true that each and every Muslim is an individual, with their own morals and beliefs, if many of those teaching the next generation of Muslims hold the Deobandi ideals, which you yourself conceded are bad, then the belief systems and ideologies of many of these young Muslims are bound to be affected.  I'm not categorising all Muslims, that's what I meant when I spoke of ""those who reject such values."" Not all, not even most, but if the above statement is true, and Deobandism holds the ideology that the article states, then it's a significant percentage.  You talk of extreme outliers, but there's been a number of polls that suggest that it's not quite as simple as that. One Washington State poll found that approximately 9% of the UK has a favourable opinion of ISIS. It would unfounded speculation to use those numbers to suggest what percentage of Muslims hold this opinion, but bear in mind that the figure is for the whole UK population."
TrueReddit,3cg58j,TyrialFrost,3,Tue Jul 7 20:38:05 2015 UTC,"Deobandis can often be like Sunni Islam's version of ""ultra orthodox"", in that they are derived from a conservative but purely traditional Sunni root (unlike, say, Wahhabism or Salafism).  The big difference between Deobandism and the other two I just mentioned is that Deobandis are, by and large, apolitical and non-violent.  It was the Deobandis in India who sided with Gandhi and used non-violent resistance as a form of ""jihad"" against the British (Jamiat Ulema Hind). The article kind of dances around that by mentioning how they arose by supporting Britain's enemies in World War 1... which they actually did not. They arose out of the 1857 rebellion where Britain massacred tens of thousands of religious Muslim clerics for rebellion. The first Deobandi seminary was formed in order to train a new generation of scholar to replace those that had just died. That was when they had given up on armed rebellion (and why they later joined Gandhi).  As for their intersection with the Taliban: When Pakistan became an inevitability (the Deobandis were initially opposed to the idea of partition), a spin-off political group emerged in Pakistan known as 'Jamiat Ulema Islam'. They had moderate success at times in politics.  A few decades later, in the early '90s under the Bhutto government, the JUI aided the ISI in setting up the Taliban in an Afghanistan wracked by civil war.  The Taliban, like virtually all Pashtun, are Deobandis by culture.  Probably half of Pakistan and India's Muslims are also Deobandi (the other half, Barelwis, are extremely similar culturally except for differences in saint-worship... Deobandis are also Sufis so anyone who distinguishes Deobandism from Barelwism by calling the latter 'Sufis' has shown their ignorance). Deobandism has also been exported worldwide for two simple reasons: There are lots of South Asians, and it's a scholarly movement (based on founding seminaries that teach up to a graduate level in Islamic studies) so it has an advantage in setting up schools. Being that they are inherently harmless (and quite representative of a massive number of Muslims in the world), Western governments and intelligence agencies (yes, to this day and yes, after thoroughly studying everything they teach in their madrassahs), see no reason to bother them.  Deobandis in the UK, however, are a little different from Deobandis elsewhere (in that they're more extreme/fringe to the point where conservative Deobandis in Pakistan are weirded out by them), but for the most part haven't fallen too far from the tree.  Theologically Deobandis and Wahhabis/Salafis are as opposite to one another as the latter are from any other traditional Sunni group. Deobandi scholars have produced many works criticizing Wahhabism/Salafism on many grounds. They're only amiable to one another because they're both culturally conservative. Or sometimes their political goals may align (like when Al-Qaeda (the originals), who are Salafi, were allied with the Deobandi Taliban... even though they have been at odds against other Salafis (ISIS) and other Deobandis (mainstream Afghanistan and much of Pakistan/India are Deobandi... meanwhile the Pakistani Taliban appear to be more Salafi leaning since they were brought up by Al-Qaeda, one reason the other tribal groups helped sink that alliance... because they were culturally traditionally Deobandi... and so they continue to aid the Afghan Taliban who are still predominantly Deobandi and not Salafi)).  Here's an article on the BBC detailing Deobandi doctrine on Jihad:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4711003.stm  Notice how they're not distinguished as 'Deobandi'? Because they represent the conservative mainstream of South Asian (and much of Central Asian) Islam. They don't need to be distinguished. Rafi Usmani is considered the unofficial ""Grand Mufti"" of Pakistan because his father was once the actual official Grand Mufti of Pakistan. They're all Deobandi. The majority of South Asians in the West outside of the UK are Deobandi. There are a lot of Barelwis in the UK. Yet the UK's South Asians have the reputation for being the most conservative. South Asians in North America are overwhelmingly Deobandi-affiliated and have the opposite reputation (conservative but well integrated and peaceful).  Now this was only one vague target of the article. The other ambiguous point was to allude to the fact that this brand of Islam is extremely conservative and antithetical to left-leaning liberals in the West.  Well... no shit. That doesn't mean anything. The Saudis are Wahhabis and by definition are far more radically conservative than Deobandis ever could be and yet they are our strongest allies. Ultra Orthodox Jews are no more conservative culturally than they are either and do just fine in the West (and the country unduly influenced by them, Israel, is also one of our strongest allies, if not the strongest if we're talking about the US).  The article sounds like, to someone who knows the subject matter, borderline Glenn Beck on the hysteria-meter."

This article claims as much and the Times of the UK claims as much. I'm not going to say ""no I don't agree"" even though actual deobandis are as I said a percentage of certain ethnic populations within the greater British Muslim demographic.  So if the 45% is true, that begs the question as to why this element-- a subsection of the Indo-Pakistani Muslim population-- has such a monopoly when it comes to establishing mosques preaching deobandism to varying degrees.  I'm not wording this very well but the point is that they are a subsection of a subsection. People who read the likes of the ""Spectator"" are almost guaranteed to disregard that.

And yet they don't seem to really be all that representative, do they?   I'm curious as to what you think ""the solution"" to this hypothetical problem of these hypothetical masses of the worst kinds of deobandis would be. As this is all very hypothetical at this point, because there's not swarms of deobandis running around the country and the very worst of the conservative Islamist elements seem to be limited to little noxious clusters that get reported on a thousand-fold and make good tabloid fodder with their idiotic antics.   but if the above statement is true   and Deobandism holds the ideology that the article states, then it's a significant percentage.    Where are they? These kinds of people at their worst-- in terms of conservative Islamism, which is the real issue here-- aren't exactly fans of hiding in plain sight, if you know what I mean.

It would unfounded speculation to use those numbers to suggest what percentage of Muslims hold this opinion, but bear in mind that the figure is for the whole UK population.    There are enough stupid people wherever you go and I wouldn't be surprised to see people running their mouths without having any real idea as to what ISIS actually is, regardless of who they are.

Yes, they are starkly different in their doctrinal beliefs about the nature of God, Muhammad, Muhammad's family, etc. however, the values they derive from the Quran and hadith (in terms of how a society should be organized are fairly consistent). Neither group, for instance, tolerates criticism of Muhammad, or accepts homosexuality, or gender equality. These values have more in common with each other than they have with Western values because all three groups refer back to one of the four classical sunni schools of jurisprudence. None of these schools can be said to prescribe or condone Western-style free speech, democracy, or human rights. The sufi-inspired Barelvis, who are often at extreme odds with Salafis and Deobandis, are still not any more 'liberal' than the other two.   Lastly, I don't think that Salafi groups, or other ultra-conservative groups are inherently or objectively better muslims simply because they happen to be the most literal or conservative. They're simply the groups that require evidence from the Quran, hadith, or sirah for their beliefs and practices.    Do you reject the idea that there is variation to any extent in how these subgroups end up behaving religiously?   No, I don't. They have different beliefs, and so they should be expected to behave differently from one another.    OK but I really don't give a shit over which group is deemed to be the most acceptably ""Western""; I also understand that there are ""mainstream"" Sunni and Shia who're ""moderate"" or ""liberal"" and engage in practices or lifestyles that'd have them labelled as being ""Western""   How would you define mainstream? Does mainstream mean the majority? Or does it mean the most palatable group of muslims? Because the two are not the same.    So to your mind there's no difference between say a well-established urbane educated Sunni living in Beirut or Istanbul, and someone hiding in a cave in Southern Afghanistan who pledges allegiance to the Taliban?   I'm not sure how you're coming up with these questions. I'm talking about ideology and doctrine. Not specific individuals. In general, normative Sunni ideology calls for a caliphate, it calls for the death of apostates, it calls for the death of homosexuals, it calls for a repressive political order that is about as far from a democracy as one can get.   Hey, I'm sure you'd love to claim ""authoritatively"" that it's some kind of fixation for them.   Are you denying that FGM is promoted in the Bohra community? In fact, its a religious requirement in at least one Sunni school of jurisprudence.    So I can confirm that you hold it to be true that it's impossible for there to be anything other then arch-conservatives when it comes to Sunnis in general and the Twelvers in terms of Shi'ism?   Again, not sure why you think that I'm claiming that only the salafis are 'true' Muslims. Muslims are whoever they define themselves to be. What I am saying is that within Sunni Islam, the Salafis, and other groups that put an emphasis on the Quran and Sunnah, have a much easier time justifying their beliefs scripturally than other groups. Also, the comparison of Salafi:Sunni as Twelver:Shia is not really a good comparison, but that would take a long time to explain, so I'll wait and see if you're interested in that."
TrueReddit,3cg58j,kyle_kyle_kyle_kyle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:20:44 2015 UTC,"I have a question. If this lack of moderation is a serious issue, then what can be done about it? In what ways could the British not only help these Muslims maintain their cultural identities, but also get them to be more in line with more liberal beliefs, like being ok with women just wearing the shawl or letting people watch TV or not being gender segregated?"
TrueReddit,3cg58j,Crib_D,2,Sat Jul 11 22:30:02 2015 UTC,"There's so much in this article that is based on supposition and fuzzy notions.   Firstly, there's the issue of definitions.  In the article, the author points out that only two of 1,700 mosques in Britain 'follow a modernist interpretation of the Koran'. The word 'modernist' might be taken to mean updated, improved, etc by a reasonably informed non-Muslim westerner and be an uncontroversial appellation.  Among significant numbers of Western Muslims and indeed most Muslims, the word is associated with a push among self-labelled Liberal Muslims to jettison widely accepted Orthodox Islamic sources, including primary sources like Hadith, in the process of jurisprudential reasoning. In the article, the Koran is cited as not having nearly enough 'modernist' interpretation but Hadith, Jurisprudential Consensus are not included although both are important sources of Law. In the article, what definition of 'modernist' being relied upon remains unclear, and is an important omission.  Further on, the author uses the words 'following an interpretation of Islam adapted to modern circumstances' in reference to American Islam. This is a vastly different question in meaning to the one perhaps posed to British Mosques making up the database used as a source in the article. I suspect this accounts for the difference in attitude that the author employs as a worrying sign among British Muslim 'extremism'.   The next anecdotal evidence used is her anxiety about the gender segregation she observed at attending Mosques and Muslim events. At Mosques, ritual prayer is gender segregated, a practice as old as the faith itself, uncontroversial from social or religious perspective. The argument among Western Muslims is providing equitable or even equal space, access and programmes for Muslim women and girls as provided for Muslim men and boys. Many Western non-Muslims imagine that this kind of segregation is a direct, imposition imported by conservative Muslims hostile to wider society rather than general misunderstanding of Western cultural norms and piss poor design on the part of immigrant Muslim communities. Many, if not a vast majority, of Muslim women push not for desegregation but to secure equitable or equal treatment in the Muslim spaces they use or occupy.  The troubling thing this author does is begin making parallels between the Taliban and Deobandi Muslims in Britain, which I find conveniently alarmist. The British Muslim community isn't in Afghanistan, nor made up largely of Afghans. Deobandi Muslims face different challenges and face different pressures in living in Britain, which will impact attitudes, practices and of a religious nature. Much of community facing Jurisprudence among Western Muslims is about seeking pragmatic accommodations with modernity, and not some nefarious plot to promote hostile illiberal communities. I can't quite understand what substantive point is being made other than the quite explicit allusion that the Taliban have exported themselves to Britain and Deobandi Muslims are bringing the Burka to a place near you.   'Hide yo kids, hide yo wife, dey Taliban is hurr.' Honestly.   As for the statement that Deobandism has raised the level of conservative Orthodoxy among other British Muslim groups, and indeed anywhere Deobandi Muslims make up any significant population, is alarmist just as the two issues I have already addressed. The group she dismisses early in the article as less significant, Saudi sponsored Salafi/Wahhabism, have exerted more pressure on worldwide conservative Orthodoxy by engaging in simplistic polemical arguments against the same groups and lax attitudes that characterised earlier generations of Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslim groups. This polemical literature is present in almost every Mosque, prayer hall, decrying heterodox attitudes and practices as blameworthy innovation serving as a Trojan horse in the pure faith of Islam. This is functionally a deep argument over what practices, attitudes and beliefs constitute Islamic authenticity, an argument that can easy be won in a bombastic polemical style than any nuanced, complex and erudite scholarly explanation. This global argument within Islam about authenticity is simplified and essentialised as a fight between Wahhabi Puritanism vs Sufi ecumenism, a patently false binary.  This word 'integrate' is similarly ill defined, although Prime Minister Cameron has made his contribution to Muscular Liberalism: it's not longer actions or inclinations that should be battled in this war against terrorism, but conservative illiberal attitudes as well. This formulation is very evident in the tone of this article; her patently false accusation of treason against the Raj by Deobandi scholars (not that I view such as immoral and addressed by another commenter) and citing Kawthari a second time for his juridical opinions (as if he solely represents Deobandi opinion in Britain), only add to the mountain menace the article seeks to achieve. There's no positive reflection on how different the Muslim community in India is from Pakistan, and how people who have the same cultural and religious background could produce two very different outcomes in attitudes. I see this as a primary failing to engage the complexities inherent in the issue being discussed, namely Muslims and modernity.   Her conclusion is weak. At no point does she acknowledge what a 'Liberal' would look like (the attempt to equate American Muslim communities with some more Liberal or integrated Islam fails to make a convincing case), nor reflect on anything but the narrow focus on British Deobandis and there seeming closeness with the Taliban (even being considered the British Taliban).  This is a fine polemic. That's all it is.  Final note: there's no real accounting for moderation and extremism among Muslims. Each Western nation seems to have its own standard, with absurd contradictions appearing to what ostensibly is a monolithic or near monolithic Muslim community."

TrueReddit,3cjv6e,deadlast,3,Wed Jul 8 14:05:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the way you titled this article.  It's really about white supremacists and their historical roots in the PNW than it is about ""racism"" per se.   The distinction, while pedantic, is significant  IMO -- too many people think ""racism is solved!"" because they associate racism with the most extreme and virulent forms of it.   Normal, otherwise decent people can be racist, even unknowingly, and that gets glossed over if you associate racism primarily with the KKK.  Substantively, the article strikes me as a bit superficial.  It doesn't really connect the dots from history to contemporary white supremacists.  It also seems odd to me that it doesn't even mention racism against  minorities other than African-Americans in the Pacific Northwest, despite its significance to PNW history.   For example, the city of Tacoma, Washington, gathered up and expelled all the Chinese in the city in the 1880s, and it didn't see another Chinese resident until the 1920s."
