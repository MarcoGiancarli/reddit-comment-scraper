Breathless,3dujsg,Bearhinox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:50:30 2015 UTC,"This photo gives me the urge to fly to Spain, walk out to the beach in a pair of terribly distracting neon swimming trunks, erect an ugly lawn chair and simply gaze maniacly whilst ocassionally taking a sip from a caprisun.  This is my new tablet wallpaper."

Breathless,3cxat8,sylban,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:24:43 2015 UTC,"It's not a supernova (singular -- the plural is 'supernovae') but the birth of a star of about 15 solar masses. The protostar is located about 2000 ly away.  The term 'supernova' refers to the cataclysmic explosion of a dying massive star undergoing core collapse. (The term 'nova' refers to a temporary flash on the surface of a white dwarf caused by accretion of infalling matter from a stellar partner.) The related term 'hypernova' refers to the categorically much larger explosions of supermassive Population III stars (which are highly metallic), thought to be the origin of long-duration gamma-ray bursts.  The image here is of an emission source known as IRS 4 (infra-red source 4) at the nexus of a bipolar nebula known as Sharpless 2-106. This specific image was taken by Hubble and was released 15 December 2012."

Breathless,3aen55,blazik,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:34:05 2015 UTC,What camera are you using? I am visiting Norway next month would love to be able to take pictures like this
Breathless,3aen55,Superraz375,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:06:20 2015 UTC,"Not my photo but in a different thread the original photographer, Andrew Tallon, said he was using these:   Canon 5DmkIII + 5DmkII with 16-35mm f/2.8L, 50mm f/1.8, 100mm f/2 and 200mm f/2.8L Lenses.    I am into photography though, and you can easily get shots that are just as beautiful without buying as expensive gear as he has. Just look up a DSLR that's in your price range and get a lens, either a prime or a zoom (which is probably better when you're a beginner since you can get a variety of shots). I primarily shoot in film which is a bit different but regardless of what you do you can get a lot out of it."
